  ".W": "Giant-cell arteritis (GCA) and polymyalgia rheumatica are systemic disorders that reportedly affect primarily white women older than age 50 years. We conducted an 11-year chart review to determine the relative occurrence and pattern of demographic involvement of GCA in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Of 101,239 computer-coded entries for individual patients aged 40 years or older, 60 charts listed GCA as a differential diagnosis. Twenty-seven patients had temporal GCA; 21 temporal artery biopsy specimens were identified. Two patients had associated systemic GCA (one with aortitis). A striking finding was that 13 of the 27 patients were black women (about 50% of the entire study population). The group with GCA and polymyalgia rheumatica (17 patients) had a significantly higher mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate than the group with \"pure\" GCA. Jaw claudication and blindness were rare. We concluded that temporal GCA seems relatively uncommon in the Gulf Coast region and in the southern United States as a whole. Furthermore, GCA seems rare in Hispanics (only one patient identified). Nonetheless, this is the first report to document a proportionally high occurrence of GCA in black patients in this part of the country.\r"

  ".W": "After a large food-borne outbreak of listeriosis in Los Angeles County, California, in 1985, the California State Department of Health Services instituted mandatory reporting of Listeria monocytogenes by clinical laboratories. From September 1, 1985, through August 31, 1986, 94 cases of listeriosis were reported in Los Angeles County for an annual crude incidence rate of 12 cases per million persons. Of the 94 cases, 37 (39%) were in neonates and/or their mothers and 57 (61%) were nonperinatal. The overall case fatality rate was 31%, with a perinatal case fatality of 16% (6 fetal and 23 nonperinatal); this compares with an epidemic perinatal case fatality rate of 32%. No significant differences were observed in age-adjusted, race-specific incidence rates among nonperinatal cases or race-specific incidence rates among perinatal cases. All but 2 of the nonperinatal patients had a known predisposing risk factor for the development of listeriosis, the most common of which was a prior history of steroid therapy. A clustering of cases was not identified. No common food sources were apparent. Patients presenting as perinatal cases were more likely to have ingested Mexican-style cheese, ice cream, and yogurt than those presenting as nonperinatal cases. Improved case ascertainment through mandatory reporting and laboratory-based surveillance will establish meaningful baseline levels of listeriosis.\r"

In addition to bursal fluid analysis, the surface temperature over the involved olecranon bursa and the contralateral (control) olecranon process was obtained by using a surface temperature probe. We compared the temperature difference between the involved and control sides in all septic and nonseptic cases. In nonseptic cases, the mean surface temperature difference was 0.7 degree C vs 3.7 degrees C in septic cases. In all septic cases, the temperature difference was 2.2 degrees C or greater (range, 2.2 degrees C to 5.1 degrees C; SD, 1.1). Use of the surface probe temperature difference proved 100% sensitive and 94% specific in discriminating septic from nonseptic cases. It seems to be more helpful than the bursal fluid leukocyte count, the predominant cell type, or Gram's stain in the early differentiation of septic and nonseptic olecranon bursitis.\r"

A possible biochemical explanation has been suggested for an association between low serum cholesterol level and increased risk of death due to injury. We, therefore, examined the association between serum cholesterol level and risk of death from accidents or violence in the 25-year follow-up of two cohorts of Finnish men (N = 1580). Although a statistically nonsignificant, negative association was observed in one cohort (hazard ratio, 0.84, with a 1 mmol/L increase in cholesterol), the other cohort showed a statistically significant, positive association in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.39). We conclude that the observed associations between serum cholesterol and deaths from injury in the present study and in cholesterol-lowering trials are probably determined by other, presently unknown factors, or by chance.\r"

Predisposing conditions were present in 17 patients with meningitis, and concurrent infections occurred in 19 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 43% of all isolates; 25% were gram-negative organisms. Of the patients in this sample, fever was present in 100%, meningismus was present in 58%, and change in mental status was present in 86%. Sixty-five percent of patients with meningitis survived; increased mortality was associated with altered mental status, inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, and hypoglycorrhachia. Delay in diagnosis, underlying disease, and bacteremia did not significantly alter outcome. All patients with focal infections presented with localizing signs and all survived.\r"

We questioned whether BAL would be helpful in decision making in a general hospital setting. Eighteen patients, none of whom had the combination of immunosuppression and diffuse roentgenographic infiltrates and none of whom had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, underwent BAL without any complications. The BAL fluid was analyzed in a hospital clinical laboratory using only stains that are generally used for bronchial washings. Retrospective analysis showed that in 9 cases (50%), the BAL analysis resulted in a significant alteration of therapy that would not have occurred using bronchial washings alone. Therefore, it appears that BAL can be safely performed in a general hospital on various patient populations, and that analysis in a nonresearch laboratory can yield clinically useful results.\r"

We present an 8-year (1979 to 1987) experience with clinic-based reporting in Connecticut. Altogether, 3566 cases were sequentially coded for demographics, diagnoses, workplace identification, and exposures at two academic occupational medicine clinics. The lungs were the principal organs of diagnosed effect, with asbestos-related disorders predominating, whereas the urinary tract, endocrine organs, and cardiovascular systems were rarely involved. Of all diseases, 64.8% were diagnosed as chronic and irreversible. Three common disorders, lead intoxication (acute and chronic), asbestosis, and occupational asthma were selected for illustration. Patients with lead poisoning and asbestosis, although collectively numerous (40 and 504, respectively), came from a small number of worksites and industries. Occupational asthma was more variable: 141 diagnosed cases came from 56 different trades and industries and were caused by 28 recognized agents. While we recognize that clinic-based reporting suffers from obvious problems with referral bias and misclassification, our experience shows that it provides an important index of disease burden. Our data document the effects of legislation and litigation on lead poisoning and asbestosis, and correspondingly helps characterize diseases that will respond to broad intervention. On the other hand, occupational asthma is more pervasive and would require a more specialized, partially clinical approach.\r"

Fallers were matched by age, sex, and living location to nonfaller control subjects. A nurse practitioner performed a comprehensive physical assessment in all subjects using a standardized protocol and physician consultation. Fallers in both populations were significantly more physically and functionally impaired than control subjects. Logistic regression identified hip weakness, poor balance, and number of prescribed medications as factors most strongly associated with falling among institutionalized subjects. A fall prediction model was developed from these findings yielding 76% overall predictive accuracy (89% sensitivity, 60% specificity). Using the model, the predicted 1-year risk of falling ranged from 12% for persons with none of the three risk factors to 100% for persons with all three risk factors. Findings among noninstitutionalized subjects were similar. These data support the concept of performing focused fall risk assessments to identify elderly patients at high risk for falling.\r"

The two groups were similar in all demographic variables, smoking-related baseline variables, and baseline levels of motivation and intention to quit smoking. The smoking status of 97% of the subjects was assessed 6 months later. In the intervention group, 46% made quit attempts and 19% quit, compared with 34% and 12%, respectively, in the control group. Intervention-group smokers made more quit attempts (mean +/- SD, 5.0 +/- 2.5 vs 1.8 +/- 0.2) and had a greater reduction in daily cigarette use (8.4 +/- 1.5 vs 3.5 +/- 1.3). Of the 74% of smokers with higher levels of motivation to quit smoking, more intervention-group smokers attempted to quit (70.8% vs 45.5%) and succeeded in quitting at the 6-month follow-up (27.1% vs 10.9%).

Of 5200 tests, 247 results were positive. Two hundred twenty-one of these charts were reviewed for roentgenographic results and the presence of symptoms. All persons were asymptomatic. Chest roentgenograms revealed the following: normal, 188; unrelated abnormalities, 24; apical pleural thickening, 5; granulomas, 2; calcified hilar node, 1; and calcified node plus granuloma, 1. We noted no active tuberculosis, nor did the chest roentgenographic results influence recommendations for isoniazid prophylaxis. We conclude that chest roentgenograms are of value in 0% to 1.3% of asymptomatic people with positive tuberculin test results. A larger study should be undertaken to further define the usefulness of chest roentgenograms in this population.\r"

Interlaboratory precision achieved by participants did not reach levels reported by various investigators, but their studies do not reflect actual clinical laboratory conditions. The intralaboratory analytical precision may be adequate for clinical diagnosis but better interlaboratory agreement must await the preparation of standards verified by definitive analyses.

It is an obsolescent myxoma that has been converted to a sclerosiderotic nodule by impregnation of the tumor's stromal connective tissue fibers with iron, calcium, and ceroid pigments, presumably following recurrent hemorrhage in the myxoma over time. Four cases of this unusual histologic variant of cardiac myxoma were identified from among 22,150 autopsies performed over the 25-year period, 1954 through 1979. These four cases were asymptomatic incidental postmortem findings discovered in two men (54 and 82 years of age) and two women (66 and 80 years of age). The original autopsy diagnoses of the left atrial lesions were fibrosiderotic nodule (Gamna-Gandy body) in one patient and organized mural thrombi in the other three patients.\r"

Monte Carlo techniques that involve a large number of repetitive simulations of a system that has probabilistic characteristics may be especially useful. These techniques can be applied to problems where complex interactions, the nondeterministic nature of medical problems, and the incompleteness of medical knowledge render traditional analytic techniques impotent. Examples include complex clinical laboratory data analysis, clinical strategy development using advanced decision analysis methodologies, and prospective evaluation of the effects of proposed changes in laboratory operations. Although Monte Carlo simulation techniques appear to be promising for clinical laboratory use, limitations must be noted. Care and effort are required in model specification if meaningful results are to be obtained and their significance convincingly conveyed.\r"

In all 27 cases, postmortem concentrations were higher than antemortem levels (9.5 +/- 2.5 nmol/L and 3.12 +/- 1.72 nmol/L, respectively). In none of these patients was there clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of digitalis toxicity. There was a significant correlation between antemortem and postmortem determinations, and between time of sampling after death and postmortem concentration. Positive correlation existed between antemortem or postmortem concentrations and dose per kilogram. The degree of elevation in digoxin levels was uniform in most cases, and the likelihood of elevation falling in the range 3.5 to 7.0 nmol/L was 66%. If the estimated concentration of digoxin at the time of death was taken as baseline, in 75% of cases the subsequent elevation was between 5.3 and 8.3 nmol/L (mean, 6.5 +/- 1.1 nmol/L). Digoxin concentrations measured in newborn infants not receiving digoxin were significantly higher after death (1.5 +/- 0.3 nmol/L) than in age-matched living infants not receiving digoxin (0.5 +/- 0.3 nmol/L). These data indicate that the size of antemortem dose, the time of sampling after death, and existence of endogenous digoxinlike factors affect postmortem readings of digoxin levels. Consequently, excessive postmortem determinations cannot be directly interpreted as proof of toxic antemortem levels.\r"

  ".W": "Fatty acid ethyl esters, a family of ethanol metabolites, are formed by esterification of ethanol with fatty acids and have been detected in human organs commonly damaged by ethanol abuse. Because alcohol-related deaths may occur up to six times as often as reported on death certificates, we undertook quantitation of these potentially longer-lived alcohol metabolites in postmortem human adipose tissue to assess their usefulness as a measure of recent ethanol exposure. After isolation and identification using sequential thin-layer and gas chromatography, fatty acid ethyl esters were present in adipose tissue of chronic alcoholics (mean +/- SEM equals 300 +/- 46 nmol/g), even though blood ethanol concentration at the time of death was undetectable. Unintoxicated nonalcoholic subjects who had no history of alcohol abuse had concentrations seven times lower (mean +/- SEM equals 43 +/- 13 nmol/g). In vitro studies demonstrate that fatty acid ethyl esters are synthesized by human adipose tissue in proportion to the ethanol concentration present and their half-life in adipose tissue of laboratory animals is 16 +/- 1.6 hours, ie, fourfold greater than that of alcohol. These results indicate that fatty acid ethyl esters are long-lived ethanol metabolites whose persistence and accumulation in adipose tissue may allow an accurate diagnosis of significant alcohol consumption even when ethanol has been completely eliminated from the body.\r"

These two apoproteins were present in the extracellular matrix as well as in the foam cells surrounding the atherosclerotic lesions. The concomitant intracellular localization of apolipoprotein A-I and of apolipoprotein A-II in the cytoplasm of foam cells supports the hypothesis that extracellular high-density lipoprotein particles are internalized in the macrophages during the atheromatous process.\r"

This study was unique in that identical sections were examined by both standard HE and immunohistochemical methods. Ninety hyperplastic axillary lymph nodes, removed from 14 female patients for a variety of diagnostic reasons, demonstrated no epithelial cells by either technique. Six of 42 nodes removed from five patients with breast cancer and known axillary metastases demonstrated tumor cells when examined with HE, whereas 13 of these nodes demonstrated cytokeratin-positive metastases.

Surprisingly, an adrenal adenoma with atrophy of the contralateral adrenal gland was found at exploratory laparotomy. Subsequent ACTH determinations that extract ACTH from the plasma before assay suggested that the apparent increase in ACTH concentration in our routine assay was due to the presence of an interfering substance(s). We conclude that the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome continues to depend on a battery of adrenal function tests and radiographic procedures and recommend that measurements of ACTH be performed only after extraction of ACTH from specimens.\r"

In each stance position five indices of steadiness were obtained by sampling the three orthogonal force signals and the two horizontal center of pressure (CP) signals for 15 seconds and computing the standard deviation for each signal. Correlations between these five indices derived from the force platform showed that the relationship between force and CP measures was generally weak. In fact, approximately 40% of the correlations were nonsignificant (p greater than .05). There was a strong trend for the retest reliability of force measures to be higher than the retest reliability of CP measures. The difference was statistically significant in three stances (p less than .05). Force measures were more sensitive than CP measures in discriminating the changes in steadiness which resulted from alterations to the base of support in the four stance positions. Factor analysis showed that force measures were the best predictors of steadiness in each stance, but the axis varied according to the particular stance condition. Although it may be appropriate in some cases to justify the choice of measure according to the nature of the clinical condition being studied, these results provide a rationale for choosing force measures in preference to CP measures on the fundamental principles of reliability and validity.\r"

A pilot study was done to look at the skill of dressing independently to determine if time was a factor in the decision to retain, modify, or completely delegate this activity. Ten patients with C6-level quadriplegia, who were capable of self-dressing at discharge, participated in the study. They were timed for dressing at home. Although all ten patients were capable of dressing independently within one hour, none did so routinely. \"Too much time and too much work\" were the reasons stated. The implication is that a functional skill must be accomplished within the individual's concept of an appropriate time and/or energy framework in order to be considered truly functional.\r"

Twenty-six patients with right cerebral infarction were admitted to a rehabilitation unit and were classified into three groups based on the evoked potentials measured on admission. The SEP classification and nine other variables reported to predict recovery after stroke were evaluated for prediction of the final outcome measure, the Barthel Scale, using stepwise multiple regression analysis. Patients with normal SEP achieved a mean Barthel score of 95 +/- 3.9 SD, while patients with an amplitude asymmetry on SEP showed a mean Barthel score of 77.5 +/- 17.5 SD. The group with absence of cortical potentials had a mean Barthel score of 59.5 +/- 21.3 SD. Six predictors (Barthel admission score, SEP, electroencephalogram, Brunnstrom staging of the arm at the time of admission, joint position sense, and hemihypesthesia) were highly correlated with the Barthel outcome score (p less than 0.05 for all). The linear regression equation with three predictors (Barthel admission score, SEP, and homonymous hemianopsia) provided the best prediction of Barthel outcome score (p = 0.005). These data indicate that the Barthel admission score is the best predictor of functional level after stroke rehabilitation. Knowledge of the median SEP and homonymous hemianopsia improve this prediction.\r"

There was no change in ATR after application of the spray or the benzocaine, even when the sequence of reflex elicitation was reversed. The only significant change (p less than 0.05) in the H-reflex was an increase in its amplitude from baseline at all posttest times following (1) the placebo application when the H-reflex preceded the ATR (0.264 +/- 0.054V, ten minutes; 0.290 +/- 0.054V, 20 minutes; and 0.322 +/- 0.058V, 30 minutes), and (2) the benzocaine spray when the ATR preceded the H-reflex (0.277 +/- 0.084V, ten minutes; 0.309 +/- 0.152V, 20 minutes; and 0.329 +/- 0.131V, 30 minutes). Within-group comparisons revealed that a significantly greater H-reflex (p less than 0.05) was obtained at 20 and 30 minutes after air spray when H-reflex/ATR test sequence was used, whereas at 30 minutes after application of the benzocaine spray a significantly greater H-reflex was seen using the ATR/H-reflex test sequence. Changes in H-reflex amplitude appear to be as much a function of the reflex testing sequence as whether an air or benzocaine spray is used.\r"

  ".W": "A small waveform precedes the compound muscle action potential evoked from the thenar eminence with median nerve stimulation with high amplifier gains. This potential is believed to emanate from fibers destined to innervate the volar aspect of the first digit. It has been suggested recently that the source of the premotor potential is the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve. In this study, the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve was blocked at the wrist. A localized zone of anesthesia was observed over the proximal midpalm, not the thenar eminence, and the premotor response remained unchanged as did a midpalmar potential. The median nerve was then blocked at the base of the thenar eminence; only then did the premotor potential disappear. The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve innervates only a small portion of the medial aspect of the thenar eminence and does not produce the thenar premotor potential. Additionally, because of the close proximity of the main median nerve to its palmar cutaneous branch, volume conduction of stimuli and responses precludes an electrophysiologic technique which exclusively localizes the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve.\r"

Compression of axillary-femoral bypass grafts can occur from a variety of causes. The primary physician should monitor graft pulses closely. Compression should be avoided by using forearm crutches instead of axillary crutches. Waist belts for prosthetic support should not be used, and alternatives such as a thigh corset or shoulder suspension should be used. The patient should avoid sleeping on the graft, using a wrist restraint when necessary. If the patient gains weight, garments should be adjusted so as not to be constricting. Upper extremity exercises, particularly in should abduction and extension, should not be so vigorous as to put tension on the graft. A 77-year-old woman with a left below-knee amputation underwent an axillary-femoral bypass for right lower extremity arterial insufficiency which subsequently thrombosed due to compression by the waist belt of her below-knee prosthesis. A series of guidelines are outlined, so that the physiatrist can help maintain graft patency, prolong limb salvage, and avert similar complications in such patients.\r"

Fifteen patients (30%) had a traditional pancreaticoduodenectomy and 36 (70%) had a pylorus-preserving procedure. Operative blood loss, resumption of oral intake, and time to discharge from the hospital were not different for the two operations. One patient (2%) died of complications of the operation, and 14 patients (27%) had nonlethal intra-abdominal complications. Two patients required reoperation: 1 had a hemoperitoneum and 1 had a breakdown of a choledochoenterostomy. Of the patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for cancer, 26 (74%) of 35 survived 1 year, 9 (47%) of 19 survived 3 years, and 3 (33%) of 10 patients survived 5 or more years postoperatively. Our data showed that (1) on a service where a large number of these operations is performed, the mortality rate of patients who have undergone a pancreaticoduodenectomy is substantially lower than in the past and that (2) the main reasons for these improved results are greater experience of a few surgeons who perform the procedure regularly and the availability of computed tomographic scans and skilled interventional radiologists, which allows postoperative infection and pancreatic fistulas to be controlled. Although pancreaticoduodenectomy is only palliative in most patients with cancer, it provides the best palliation and the only chance of cure, and the procedure can be recommended when performed in tertiary care centers that possess these elements of success.\r"

The presence or absence of each of 11 clinical indicators and their association with serious intra-abdominal injury were analyzed in 3223 patients with blunt trauma. Linear and logistic regressions were used to determine which factors were significant predictors of an increased probability of intra-abdominal injury. Arterial base deficit less than -3 mEq/L, major chest injury, hypotension, and pelvic fractures were found to significantly increase the chance of intra-abdominal injury. Early diagnostic evaluation of the abdomen using diagnostic peritoneal lavage or computed tomography should be strongly considered in patients with blunt trauma who present with these associated factors.\r"

The overall clinical performance measures for the 444 masses from which diagnostic fine-needle aspirations were obtained and excluding the cystosarcoma were 0.98 sensitivity, 0.94 specificity, and 0.92 positive predictability. Masses diagnosed as benign by fine-needle aspiration can be followed up clinically.

All seven local recurrences (6%) were detected at an early stage and treated without removal of the prosthesis. Recurrence of disease occurred more frequently in patients with involved axillary lymph nodes and larger tumors. Patient survival was adversely affected by nodal metastasis and the absence of tumor estrogen receptors. Adverse outcome in this series correlated to known prognostic factors for breast cancer. Disease-free and overall survivals were comparable with our previous experience with mastectomy alone for breast carcinoma. In the absence of any apparent negative impact on patient outcome, and because of the well-documented positive psychosocial benefit of immediate reconstruction, this procedure should be routinely offered to women with operable breast cancer.\r"

Thirty-eight of the pneumothoraces were small (less than 20% of volume), 55 were moderate (20% to 40% of volume), 36 were large (greater than 40% of volume), and 2 were of unknown size. Overall, catheter aspiration for simple pneumothorax was successful in 90 patients (69%). The success rate was 75% with needle-induced, 53% with spontaneous, and 75% with traumatic pneumothoraces. Small pneumothoraces were successfully managed with catheter aspiration for simple pneumothorax in 87% of patients, moderate-sized in 60%, and large in 61%. There were three complications (2.3%), including one hemothorax and two retained sheared catheter tips.

To determine the optimal timing of screening and surgery, we reviewed all children younger than 16 years old who were undergoing surgical treatment. From 1970 to 1988, 33 children 6 months old to 15.9 years old (mean, 9 years old) with MCT or C-cell hyperplasia or both underwent total thyroidectomy. Follow-up was 4 months to 15 years after surgery (mean, 9 years). Six of 31 patients presented with a neck mass. Basal immunoreactive calcitonin level was increased in 3 of 7 patients with C-cell hyperplasia alone, in 10 of 18 patients with nonmetastatic MCT, and in all 5 patients with metastatic MCT. At the time of surgery, 7 patients had C-cell hyperplasia, 19 patients had MCT without metastasis, and 7 patients had MCT with metastases. All children with metastasis were more than 12 years old. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid was seen as early as age 6 months in a child with multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIb (MEN-IIb) and age 3 years in a child with MEN-IIa. At follow-up, 25 patients were free of disease and 8 had had recurrent disease. Two of the 8 patients with MEN-IIb had died. All 6 children with a neck mass at presentation had recurrent disease. Of 27 patients diagnosed by screening, 25 had no evident disease and 2 had persistent disease. Thus, in children with MEN-II syndromes, screening studies are highly effective in detecting MCT. All children with MEN-IIb should be studied shortly after birth, and those with MEN-IIa should be studied by 1 year old.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of staging workup in primary and recurrent malignant melanoma, we reviewed the results in 115 patients with primary melanoma and in 28 patients with recurrent disease who underwent evaluation with chest roentgenograms, radionuclide bone and liver scans, and either a radionuclide brain scan or computed tomography of the brain. Upper gastrointestinal tract series with small-bowel follow-through were obtained in 42 patients. Metastatic disease was documented in nine of 143 chest roentgenograms, seven of 137 liver-spleen scans, three of 141 bone scans, two of 85 brain scans, two of 43 brain computed tomographic scans, and two of 42 upper gastrointestinal tract series. All documented metastasis was in stage II and recurrent melanoma. Postoperatively determined serum lactate dehydrogenase levels showed greater than 300 U/L in all patients with documented metastasis except in two with bone and one with brain metastases. We conclude that, in view of low yield, there is no role for routine metastatic workup to detect silent metastasis in malignant melanoma. Elevated postoperative serum lactate dehydrogenase levels indicate need for metastatic workup.\r"

The risk of shock occurring during the first 2 hours after the skeletal muscle PO2 assessment was 2.2 times higher if median skeletal muscle PO2 assessment was below 22.5 mm Hg. If inotropes were administered, no significant difference was found in the incidence of shock if skeletal muscle PO2 was below or above 22.5 mm Hg. Skeletal muscle PO2 assessment enables the determination of the severity of shock and determination of risk of shock in critically ill patients, provided no treatment with inotropes has been instituted.\r"

Neutrophils from burn patients had a different pattern of oxygen consumption than control cells; the rate of QO2 at rest was higher, while the magnitude of the respiratory burst was lower in patient than in control PMNs, depending on whether the cells were incubated in media or normal serum. The burn-induced changes in patient PMN metabolism seem to be due to circulating factors, at least in part, since the pattern of increased resting and decreased stimulated QO2 could be transferred to control cells by incubating them in burn serum. Thus, a thermal injury alters neutrophil metabolism as well as systemic metabolism.\r"

This procedure utilizes a 30-gauge anterior chamber needle that is gently advanced into the offending duct, and methylene blue dye is injected to outline the involved duct for easy dissection though a circumareolar incision. This provides the pathologist with an intact specimen and avoids the problems associated with specimen roentgenography or loss of a ductal probe during the procedure. Because we feel that all patients with a bloody nipple discharge warrant a biopsy, this procedure provides a safe, rapid, effective method and allows the biopsy to be done on an outpatient basis.\r"

  ".W": "Hydrocephalus is an important complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We analyzed several factors possibly related to hydrocephalus following SAH in 3521 patients from the International Study on the Timing of Aneurysm Surgery. Hydrocephalus was diagnosed on admission computed tomographic (CT) scans in 15% of patients and was thought to be clinically symptomatic in 13.2% of patients. There was a 5.9% overlap between these groups. Using contingency table analysis, we found the following were significantly related to clinical hydrocephalus: increasing age; preexisting hypertension; admission blood pressure measurements; postoperative hypertension; admission CT findings of intraventricular hemorrhage, a diffuse collection of subarachnoid blood, and a thick focal collection of subarachnoid blood; posterior circulation site of aneurysm; focal ischemic deficits; use of antifibrinolytic drugs preoperatively; hyponatremia; admission level of consciousness; and a low score on the Glasgow outcome scale. Using discriminate factor analysis to predict clinical hydrocephalus, the most important variables in order were the following: CT hydrocephalus, intraventricular hemorrhage, admission level of consciousness, presubarachnoid hypertension, increasing age, subarachnoid blood noted on CT scan, posterior circulation aneurysm site, and hypertension postoperatively (canonical correlation = .399). We conclude that the development of hydrocephalus after SAH is multifactorial. Factors that compromise cerebrospinal fluid circulation acutely (eg, intraventricular hemorrhage, hemorrhage from a posterior circulation site of aneurysm, and diffuse spread of subarachnoid blood) contribute to the development of acute hydrocephalus. These same factors, plus the use of antifibrinolytic drugs preoperatively, are also important in the pathogenesis of clinical hydrocephalus, perhaps by promoting subarachnoid fibrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The CSF CK-BB level was as reliable as an index of brain injury. Cerebrospinal fluid neuron-specific enolase, CSF CK-BB and serum neuron-specific enolase levels correlated with the neurological outcome at 3 months. Thus, the analysis of these enzymes in CSF seems to be useful in the early prognostic assessment of cardiac arrest victims.\r"

The clinical and pathologic findings are closely correlated. Ataxia and chorea are related to severe neuronal loss in the dentate nucleus with calcification in the globus pallidus. Dementia occurs with progressive demyelination of the centrum semiovale, and loss of posterior column function occurs with neuroaxonal dystrophy of the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus.\r"

The IAP memory performance following perfusion of the hemisphere contralateral to severe hippocampal lesions was impaired in five of six patients. These patients also exhibited hypometabolism of the impaired temporal lobe as determined independently by positron emission tomography. The single patient with a severely damaged hippocampus who did not demonstrate IAP memory impairment with contralateral hemisphere injection did not exhibit perfusion of the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery with amobarbital. Memory performance following intracarotid amobarbital injection contralateral to a less severely damaged hippocampus was impaired in 14 of 24 patients and was not related to extent of hippocampal damage, temporal lobe hypometabolism of labeled glucose, perfusion of the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery, hemispheric language dominance, or order of injection. These results indicate that impaired memory performance during IAP may reflect severe hippocampal damage and/or epileptogenic abnormality.\r"

We believe that continuous repetitive electrical stimulation caused our patient's unusual symptoms by altering the association pathways through which visual data are experienced. To our knowledge, the association between periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges and metamorphopsia or palinopsia has heretofore not been reported.\r"

Somatosensory evoked potentials were reliable predictors of outcome, particularly if both the initial and early repeated somatosensory evoked potentials were considered. Visual evoked potentials were not as reliable predictors as somatosensory evoked potentials; however, the presence or absence of both was significantly related to outcome. These data are generally consistent with the adult literature. We suggest that somatosensory evoked potentials be the evoked potential of choice in evaluating the prognosis of comatose children.\r"

In an attempt to identify associated problems at an earlier age, the neuromotor and developmental progress of 33 children who had transient hypertonicity during early infancy was analyzed. At 2-3 years of age, various developmental abnormalities were identified in more than two-thirds of these children. Delays in speech and language development and also in fine motor/adaptive and behavioral difficulties were most frequently present. Over time, these problems persisted and other disorders also became apparent. At 5 years of age or older, learning disabilities were frequent and associated with language and perceptual problems. None of the patients had epilepsy; mental retardation was present in only 2 children. Our study demonstrates that children with transient hypertonicity in early infancy are at risk for various developmental problems which can be identified as early as 2 years of age. It also indicates that although their severity lessens over time, these developmental abnormalities tend to persist.\r"

Seventeen patients, all of whom were born at term with dural sinus thrombosis diagnosed in the neonatal period, were retrospectively identified and reviewed. Diagnosis was determined by unenhanced computed tomography which demonstrated a dense sagittal sinus with concomitant small ventricles. Two patients had ancillary studies (i.e., cerebral angiography and nuclear flow scan) which confirmed the diagnosis. Only 4 patients had evidence of perinatal asphyxia. Three patients were identified as having associated conditions known to predispose them to dural sinus thrombosis. None of the patients tested had an identifiable hypercoagulable state. Neonatal seizures were the initial presentation in 15 patients. Seizure onset predominantly occurred during the first week of life. Subsequent examinations were available in all 17 patients and ranged up to 6 years. Only 3 patients had seizures beyond the neonatal period. In 11 of 12 infants with no history of perinatal asphyxia, neurodevelopmental outcomes were normal. Two of 4 infants with perinatal asphyxia had neurologic sequelae. Dural sinus thrombosis represents an important and under-recognized cause of neonatal seizures in term infants. In the absence of perinatal asphyxia, normal neuro-developmental outcome is likely and the risk of seizure recurrence is low.\r"

On neurologic testing, Williams syndrome patients had greater difficulty with gross and fine motor coordination, oromotor skills, and cerebellar function than did those with Down syndrome.

Treatment with dichloroacetate lowered the serum lactic acid level but did not affect his clinical condition. At 13 months of age, cardiomyopathy was diagnosed and he died at the age of 29 months of circulatory failure. Both children had mitochondrial myopathy. Postmortem examination of the boy revealed marked morphologic changes of the mitochondria in both skeletal muscle and the myocardium; biochemical investigation of skeletal muscle mitochondria demonstrated deficiencies in both complex I (NADH ferricyanide reductase) and complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). The disease in these siblings differs in several respects from previously reported patients with mitochondrial myopathy and cytochrome c oxidase deficiency.\r"

Plasmapheresis appeared to produce a fluctuating course in our patient. Prior to the availability of effective therapeutic intervention for Guillain-Barre syndrome, a natural course, characterized by recurrence of symptoms, predicted poorer recovery. Fluctuations related to plasmapheresis may not carry similar implications; the clinician should consider this phenomenon in assessing prognosis.\r"

The authors outline the steps in the hiring process to provide a useful reference for department chairpersons and division heads and to help them deal with the school administrators, attorneys, and immigration officials they will encounter during the hiring process. Of particular importance is understanding recruiting procedures, visa classifications, and the prohibition in hiring physicians directly from their U.S. residency and fellowship positions without having them first return for two years to their home countries. A common error is to recruit medical school faculty without first considering that the final candidates might be aliens; when they are, the process of hiring aliens must be dealt with retroactively. Immigration law currently does allow hiring an alien physician (as a teacher) if that physician is the most qualified candidate.\r"

The division provides approximately 70% of all inpatient teaching by attending physicians, provides all of the general medicine outpatient teaching, and has substantial impact on medical student training programs. The division is responsible for more than $1.5 million of clinical services and approximately 10% of hospital admissions, and it is responsible for approximately 40% of all patients on the general medicine service. Research activities are divided into several distinct modules, including medical informatics, clinical epidemiology, occupational medicine, geriatrics, medical competency testing, and ethics. The division receives approximately $1.2 million from external sources, including the federal government and foundations, for its research activities. Because of its success, it may serve as a potential model for similar divisions in other departments of medicine.\r"

  ".W": "The Age Discrimination in Employment Act was amended in 1986 to remove age-determined mandatory retirement for nearly all employees. The present study was prompted by the concern that if medical school faculty failed to retire, there would be no positions available for new faculty. The author used 1984-85 data on both tenure-track and non-tenure-track faculty of the five medical schools of the University of California (UC) to make projections, over 20 years, of faculty age distributions and available positions, at several possible growth rates and delays in retirement age. Association of American Medical Colleges data on all U.S. medical school faculty in 1980 were used to show that the UC data were not exceptional. Acknowledging the various assumptions used in manipulating the data and the need to examine longitudinal data on faculty age, growth, turnover, and retirement to make more realistic projections, the author demonstrates that the impact of delaying retirement by several years would be minimal. Because of this conclusion and also the inevitable aging of the faculty resulting from the slowed growth of medical schools, academic institutions should pay more attention to maintaining the vitality and productivity of their individual faculty members, regardless of age.\r"

A survey of its 109 members in 1987 elicited 84 responses. The findings indicate that most respondents were American Indians to less than one-quarter degree, and although they were practicing in locations where large numbers of Indian people reside, 65% reported that less than 25% of their direct patient care activity involved Indian patients. In regard to Native American physicians, the survey findings and other published information contradict the view that minority medical practitioners are more likely than their white counterparts to practice in areas where large numbers of their respective minority populations reside and will, therefore, provide medical care to significant numbers of their respective minority populations.\r"

They scored significantly lower than non-Indian students, but there was no difference in terms of traditional admissions criteria between the Indian students who withdrew and those who graduated.

Problems noted by students included poor academic preparation, excessive family responsibilities, and encountering cultural misperceptions.

In this paper, the authors analyze the practice locations of 689 family physicians who graduated from residency programs in Texas between 1979 and 1987 and who were practicing in Texas in 1988. One-third of these graduates were practicing in cities the same size as their residency program city. More than half were in counties located within 60 miles of the residency city. Both of these trends can be explained to a large degree by the fact that a high percentage of graduates remained in their residency city to practice. When these nonmobile graduates are removed from the sample, the findings show no correlation between the size of the residency city and the size of the practice city. More than two-thirds of those graduates who left their residency city were in counties beyond a 60-mile radius. Almost two-thirds were practicing in communities of less than 25,000 population. The authors conclude that state support for family practice residency training has been effective in distributing family physicians in a manner that addresses the needs of the state of Texas as a whole.\r"

Each student was assigned to a surgeon and accompanied this preceptor on rounds, in the operating room, and in the office. To determine whether the students' learning was affected by being outside the university, the authors looked at the experience from 1977 to 1986 with 683 surgery students who took community preceptorships and 696 surgery students who took only university-based rotations. The two groups were compared in regard to age, sex, basic science grade-point average, class rank at the end of the first two years in medical school, ward evaluations, grades on departmental final examinations, and National Board of Medical Examiners \"mini-examination\" scores and Part II surgery scores. No differences were found. Choices of specialty for the first postgraduate year and evaluations of program directors were reviewed for 1982, 1985, and 1986, and were similar for all three years. The preceptorship program has been popular with students, who stated that they valued the one-to-one relationship with surgeons who liked to teach. The program has relieved pressure on the university hospital system and provided a good learning experience for students.\r"

Positive attitudes were also related to less favorable attitudes toward glove-wearing and greater belief that more frequent glove use would have a negative effect on patient care.\r"

  ".W": "What are often called \"little-ticket\" items--X-rays and laboratory tests--account for 25-30% of all health care costs. Two such items were the focus of this study, which took place at an inner-city community health center operated by the Department of Family Medicine of Cook County Hospital and involved 20 family practice residents over a period of nine weeks. The first item was the complete blood count (CBC) with differential, a prototype of a low-cost, high-volume test often ordered by reflex; the second, the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) test, a high-cost, low-volume test normally associated with a differential diagnosis or clinical reasoning. Through the use of a simple educational intervention based on quality of care, not cost-containment, and an audit feedback system, the authors were able to reduce significantly the rates of ordering TSH tests (p less than .0001) and CBCs (p = .05). This effect on the rates persisted five months after the intervention terminated. In addition, the percentage of TSH tests clinically indicated by explicit criteria increased significantly (p less than .001) during the intervention. However, this effect showed signs of diminishing five months after the intervention ended. The percentage of CBCs clinically indicated did not change significantly as a result of this intervention.\r"

To attract outstanding students, departments of medicine must strive to improve the quality of their training programs. In the setting of a university-affiliated residency program, the authors employed a strategy based on organization development principles to identify remediable educational problems and to facilitate the process of solving these problems. Residents, attending physicians, and administrators used a consensus-building method, the nominal group technique, to develop problem lists ranked by two criteria--relative importance and potential for solution. Problems of high importance and high potential for solution were identified and assigned to committees of housestaff and faculty for action. Management plans consisting of short-term and long-term interventions were created to solve each problem. These plans were widely accepted and short-term interventions were successfully implemented. This strategy represents a pragmatic approach to improving internal medicine residency programs because it focuses limited institutional resources on problems that are both important and amenable to change.\r"

One hundred and eight patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of whom 47 had a positive serum latex agglutination assay, 100 healthy controls and 95 diseased controls (25 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 25 ankylosing spondylitis, 20 osteoarthritis and 25 bronchial asthma) were evaluated for the presence of IgG-, IgA- and IgM-RF by ELISA. Elevated levels of IgG-, IgA-, and IgM-RF could be demonstrated in respectively 94%, 91% and 98% of serum samples from RA patients with a positive latex test and in 72%, 69% and 8% of serum samples from RA patients with a negative latex test. In the latter patient group, increased levels of one or more RF isotypes could be detected in 82% of the patients. Except for the presence of IgG-RF in serum of 20% of the SLE patients, increased levels of RF isotypes were present in less than 5% of the diseased controls. Highly significant correlations were found between serum IgM-RF levels as detected by ELISA and those of the latex and the Rose-Waaler agglutination assays. Positive correlations were also found between the serum levels of the three RF isotypes investigated and between the levels of RF isotypes as measured in serum and synovial fluid of the same patient. Compared to agglutination assays, the ELISA for the quantitative detection of RF isotypes is a more reproducible and sensitive test which avoids some of the problems encountered in earlier ELISA methods.\r"

One hour after a single dose of indomethacin 50 mg there was significant impairment of psychomotor function (critical flicker fusion frequency threshold and choice reaction time) (Wilcoxon p less than 0.05). Pretreatment with indomethacin 25 mg t.i.d. for 7 days prevented this impairment. Thus we conclude that tolerance occurs over the course of a week to the psychomotor effects of indomethacin.\r"

Two minor complications (transient lateral rectus paresis and a small retrobulbar hematoma) were observed.

In one patient a posterior chamber lens was placed in the ciliary sulcus 3 months after the lens had been removed, and in the other patient a posterior chamber lens was implanted intraoperatively after pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy. Improved visual results were obtained in both cases, and there was no evidence of rubeosis or elevated intraocular pressure. In selected cases preservation of the anterior capsule may be important to implant posterior chamber lenses in eyes requiring pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy. To our knowledge this technique has not previously been reported.\r"

In return they would have priority for receiving organs made available by the program.

A significantly increased rate of death from laryngeal cancer and an elevated rate of death from lung cancer were observed in a cohort analysis. One or two deaths might have been due to pleural mesothelioma. There was no increase in the rate of death from gastrointestinal cancer or from nonmalignant respiratory disease. Case-control analysis showed no association between the risk of laryngeal or lung cancer and the total duration of employment (a surrogate for the extent of ambient exposure to asbestos or other workplace toxic substances) or employment in departments where asbestos had been used. An association between risk of death and occupational exposure is uncertain.\r"

Within this population, 55.2% were lacto-ovovegetarian (consumed meat, poultry, or fish less than one time per week with no restrictions as to egg or dairy product consumption) in 1976 and most abstained from alcohol, tobacco, and pork products. Baseline data included demographic variables, information on current and past dietary habits, exercise patterns, use of prescription drugs, use of alcohol and tobacco, measures of religiosity, occupation and residential histories, anthropometric data, and menstrual and reproductive histories. Nonfatal case ascertainment was completed through review of self-reported hospitalizations obtained from annual self-administered mailed questionnaires and through computerized record linkage with two California population-based tumor registries. Fatal case ascertainment was completed via record linkage with computerized California state death certificate files, the National Death Index, and individual follow-up. During the 6 years of follow-up, 52.8% of the 34,198 study subjects reported at least one hospitalization. A total of 20,702 medical charts were reviewed for cancer and cardiovascular disease incidence and 1406 incident cancer cases and 2716 deaths from all causes were identified after baseline data collection.\r"

Age at first live birth, maternal history of breast cancer, age at menopause, educational attainment, and obesity were all significantly related to risk. However, increasing consumption of high fat animal products was not associated with increased risk of breast cancer in a consistent fashion. Nor were childhood and early teenage dietary habits (vegetarian versus nonvegetarian) related to subsequent, adult risk of developing breast cancer. Also, a derived index of percent of calories from animal fat in the adult years was not significantly related to risk. These results persisted after simultaneously controlling for other, potentially confounding variables, utilizing Cox proportional hazard regression models.\r"

There was no relationship between body mass index (as measured by Quetelet's Index) and risk. A history of prostate \"trouble\" was associated with a 60% increase in risk which was highly significant. Although there were suggestive relationships between increasing animal product consumption and increased risk, these results did not persist after accounting for the influence of fruit and vegetable consumption.

Data were obtained from routine epidemiologic questionnaires administered to all patients on admission. An index of beta-carotene intake was computed based on the vitamin A activity of 27 fruits and vegetables included in a food frequency checklist. A similar measure of fat intake from meats was computed based on nine meats included in the checklist. Intake frequencies of common and alcoholic beverages also were studied. A significant age-adjusted and residence-adjusted protective effect for high levels of beta-carotene intake was observed (relative risk [RR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.99). This effect was evident particularly among men 68 years of age and younger (RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.66), but not among subjects older than 68 years of age. A trend toward increased risk for fat intake was not significant. However, the reported usual consumption of high-fat milk was associated with increased risk (RR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.50). A greater reported frequency of whole milk intake was similarly associated with increased risk. Men who reported drinking three or more glasses of whole milk daily had an RR of 2.49 (95% CI, 1.27 to 4.87), compared with men who reported never drinking whole milk. When these findings are evaluated in the context of other recent studies, the weight of the evidence appears to favor the hypothesis that animal fat intake is related to increased risk of prostate cancer.\r"

The cytostatics used were doxorubicin (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) (19 perfusions), melphalan (two perfusions), and a combination of these agents (eight perfusions). Before perfusion most patients had been treated by surgical excision(s), radiotherapy, or systemic chemotherapy. Of 17 patients perfused because of local inoperable tumor, four showed prolonged complete remission of the tumor mass, stable disease was seen in three, and ten showed progression. The complete remissions observed in three patients with aggressive fibromatosis and in one with lymphangiosarcoma occurred after perfusion with doxorubicin combined with melphalan. Doxorubicin added to the perfusate as the sole cytostatic was not effective. Local recurrence was observed in five of nine patients treated by adjuvant perfusion, always after dubiously radical tumor excision. Toxicity was high, especially in the first few years. Tissue necrosis necessitated amputation in three cases (in two after perfusion with doxorubicin and melphalan and in one after repeated perfusion with doxorubicin only). This complication was no longer seen after adjustment of the dosage and dose distribution of doxorubicin, but the morbidity after perfusion with doxorubicin remained considerable.\r"

  ".W": "The occurrence of treatment-related hematologic malignancies after adjuvant therapy with alkylating agents for gastrointestinal cancers, ovarian carcinoma, and breast cancer and after treatment for Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, germ-cell tumors, and multiple myeloma has been well documented. Adjuvant chemotherapy is frequently used for the treatment of early stage breast cancer, and to date there has been no increase in the incidence of secondary myelodysplastic syndromes or acute leukemia after cyclophosphamide-based regimens when compared with surgical controls. This report describes two patients who developed acute myelocytic leukemia only after exposure to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil adjuvant therapy. These two cases of acute leukemia, which developed 3 years after diagnosis of breast cancer and initiation of chemotherapy, were characterized by trilineage dysplasia and pancytopenia, and had abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7: characteristics consistent with treatment-related leukemia. Many women are diagnosed with early stage breast cancer each year who are potential candidates for adjuvant therapy. Although certain subgroups of patients have been shown to benefit from adjuvant therapy, continued efforts must be directed at identifying responders so that others will not be exposed to the additional risks of chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Because increased effects have been achieved when murine tumors are irradiated after a period of hypoxia and because of anecdotal clinical experiences of an improved result after irradiation of previously anemic patients in hyperbaric oxygen, the relationship between irradiation and increased survival was investigated in seventy-two patients with advanced head and neck or cervical cancer. Anemia was achieved by means of a two-stage isovolemic venesection maintained for seventy-two hours, hemoglobin was returned to a normal level, and treatment in hyperbaric oxygen was started. Marked tumor shrinkage after the induction of anemia and before radiotherapy was seen and was probably disease, site, and hemoglobin level related. As a result, a possible new approach to cancer therapy is suggested. After completion of therapy, the 1-year disease-free survival for patients with head and neck and cervical cancer was not improved, but the 21-month survival for cervical cancer was improved. Further studies are strongly urged.\r"

Cases were 172 women with BBD that underwent biopsy; controls were 134 women free of breast signs or symptoms. All cases and controls had undergone mammography. For all types of BBD combined, parity, use of oral contraceptives, and use of exogenous estrogen after menopause were strongly protective, whereas obesity and early menarche were weakly protective. Family history of breast cancer was virtually unrelated to BBD. The protective effect of parity was stronger for BBD with intralobular or extralobular fibrosis, and with mammographic homogeneous density or large nodular densities, than it was for BBD without these characteristics. Similar relations with the histologic and mammographic features were observed for obesity. These findings suggest that some risk factors for BBD have effects that are related to specific features of its morphology.\r"

In each case, material including a hepatic lobe was reduced to serial slices 1 mm thick using a ham slicer, then the tumors, ducts with carcinoma in situ, and those with dysplasia were submitted to reconstruction. In a 3D map of biliary tree reproduced on a display, a dysplastic zone was shown in most cases surrounding a focus of carcinoma, justifying the assumption of a dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. The carcinoma itself proved to form multiple foci along bile ducts in as many as 42% of the patients, in some of whom the foci were independent without any intervening dysplasia. These results suggest that as extensive a surgical measure as possible should be taken in designing a strategy against this tumor.\r"

All benign tumors exhibited a normal DNA content (diploid), whereas 65% of the malignant tumors showed an abnormal DNA content (aneuploid). The ploidy distribution of malignant tumors was bimodal with an increasing frequency near diploid DNA index (DI), and a second group had a DI ranging from triploid to tetraploid. In estimating the degree of malignancy eight independent histomorphologic and cytologic criteria were introduced. A good correlation was observed between DNA content abnormalities and the grade of differentiation of breast carcinomas. The percentage of S-phase cells of DNA aneuploid cell lines was significantly higher than in the diploid ones. The highly differentiated breast carcinomas (Grade 1) indicated lower S-phase values as compared to the undifferentiated (Grade 3) ones. S-phase values estimated by FCM were about two times higher than the 3H-thymidine labeling index (LI) obtained by an in vitro procedure. The data estimated in this study showed that DNA determinations as an adjunct to conventional histopathologic assessment may provide objective clinically relevant information with respect to the degree of malignancy and prognosis of patients with breast carcinoma.\r"

Two more adenomas, both composed of Hurthle cells, showed multiple numerical chromosome deviations with trisomy 4 and tetrasomy 7 in common. Six metastasizing carcinomas were characterized by normal stemlines, which indicates that malignancy in thyroid neoplasia cannot be excluded by cytogenetic techniques used currently. Comparisons between cytogenetic findings and cytophotometric DNA measurements in the material studied illustrate that euploid tumors represent a heterogenous group including cases with various gross structural chromosome aberrations of yet unknown clinical significance. Further studies of additional material with long-term follow-up are called for by our findings of structural and numerical chromosome aberrations in follicular neoplasms that are benign according to histologic criteria.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic bioptic screening of 504 asymptomatic postgastrectomy patients, 15 to 46 years after initial surgery, revealed ten gastric stump cancers of which six turned out to be early cancers; three of the early carcinomas were found during follow-up after prior severe dysplasia. At first endoscopy mild dysplasia was found in 58, moderate dysplasia in 11, and severe dysplasia in none of the patients. Follow-up biopsies in 177 patients showed mild dysplasia in 30, moderate dysplasia in six, and severe dysplasia in six patients. Regression of severe dysplasia was not observed. Both progression and regression of mild and moderate dysplasia occurred. At the first endoscopy the frequency of atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, cystic dilatation of glands, and foveolar hyperplasia in the stomal biopsy specimens was 45%, 35%, 54%, and 47%, respectively; during follow-up, 47%, 48%, 56%, and 56% respectively. These four lesions were significantly more frequent in the biopsy specimens of patients with gastric carcinoma or dysplasia than in the other patients and they were present in the environment of the tumor in all the surgical specimens of the six early cancers detected by the screening. Preoperatively a combination of these four lesions could be demonstrated in only those early gastric cancer patients, in whom more than eight stomal biopsy specimens were taken. Of 34 patients with severe atrophy in three or more stomal biopsy specimens taken at the same time, two manifested early stump cancer during follow-up. Severe dysplasia is a marker of malignancy and demands close follow-up; the value of mild and moderate dysplasia is less clear. The combination of atrophy, especially severe atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, cystic dilatation, and foveolar hyperplasia in the biopsy specimens of a single patient may also point to increased cancer risk. It is advisable to obtain multiple biopsy specimens of the anastomosis, also because early gastric cancer may occur without a suspect macroscopic appearance.\r"

Remarkably high levels of c-myc expression were found in colorectal cancers (eight of 11), but not in gastric cancers. High levels of c-myc expression were also detected in colorectal polyps and in metastatic liver tumors. In colorectal polyps, the transcript levels significantly correlated with the histologic malignancy and the size. In contrast, neither c-fos nor c-Ki-ras was overexpressed in colorectal and gastric cancers, and transcripts of c-Ha-ras and p53 were not evident in any tissue examined. In light of these observations the c-myc expression may be specifically associated with the evolution of colorectal cancer as well as progression and maintenance stages, hence may prove to be a useful marker to evaluate the malignant potential of colorectal polyps.\r"

All but one case of DFSP with FS developed on the trunk of the body. Eight of the nine patients (89%) had one recurrence with a shorter prerecurrent interval than that of the ordinary DFSP, and a hipbone metastasis was identified in one patient. These findings reflect the unfavorable course, in contrast to the ordinary DFSP. Microscopically, the FS areas were presented either in the initial lesion (five cases) or in the recurrent one (four cases), areas showing cellularity, mitotic figures, and cytologic anaplasia that exceeded those in the DFSP areas. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans with FS and allied categories such as SFS and SV MFH shared various clinical and histologic features but there was a diversity in the prognosis relative to the grade of malignancy. The relationship between DFSP with FS and the allied tumors was given attention.\r"

Most patients presented with pain and swelling and were aged 10 to 30 years. The histologic appearance was that of epithelial islands in a fibrous stroma, usually with a prominent vascular pattern and a transition between the two. Twenty-six (31%) patients had recurrent local disease, 13 (15%) developed lung metastasis, and six (7%) had lymph node metastasis. Nine patients with lung metastasis had preceding recurrent local disease. Risk factors for recurrent or metastatic disease included male sex, pain, symptoms of less than 5 years' duration, and initial treatment by biopsy, curettage, excision, or resection. The only histologic feature associated with an increased recurrence rate was lack of squamous differentiation. Eleven patients died of their disease, and seven are alive with metastatic disease. Forty-one patients were still alive without disease 1 month to 47 years after treatment. Our results indicate that amputation or, when technically feasible, wide en bloc resection is the treatment of choice. All patients require long-term follow-up for evidence of local recurrence or lung metastasis.\r"

Five patients who had a diagnosis during surgery of adenoma and who had fewer than 3.5 glands removed had recurrence of hypercalcemia after surgery. Fourteen patients (70%) had pancreatic islet cell tumors. All had one or more elevated serum polypeptide hormones, and six had symptoms related to the hormones produced. Multiple pancreatic tumors were identified in the nine patients who underwent surgery. Three patients who died had a mean survival of 6.3 +/- 2.9 years. Eight patients had pituitary tumors; seven had macroadenomas. Of the eight patients with pituitary tumors, seven had high serum prolactin and responded to bromocriptine therapy, whereas the eighth patient had acromegaly treated with radiotherapy. It was concluded that hypercalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism in MEN-I syndrome patients should be managed by a resection of four glands and transplantation of one half gland into the forearm because none of the patients has shown evidence of a recurrence, and serum calcium levels have been normal. Pancreatic tumors, which are usually multiple, may be asymptomatic. Patients with these tumors usually have long survival rates, even with distant metastasis. Total pancreatectomy may be the method of choice, especially in patients with gastrinoma caused by the diffuse nature of the disease. Long-term follow-up is needed, however, with more patients. Pituitary tumors are primarily prolactin-producing tumors, and medical treatment is the method of choice.\r"

Of 65 patients with malignant ascites (40 women; 25 men), the primary site was known in 51 cases (80%). Common sites in women were the ovaries, endometrium, and cervix; in men, common sites were the colon, rectum, and stomach. For five women and nine men the primary site was unknown. Median survival from diagnosis was 7.5 days (mean, 43 days; range 1-256 days). Chest radiograph and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan did not disclose the occult primary. An occult primary was detected while the patient was alive in only two cases and at autopsy in two other patients. Due to the poor prognosis for this disease, we do not recommend an aggressive approach to malignant ascites of unknown origin, except perhaps in women, in whom ovarian cancer should be suspected.\r"

Fifty-six of 110 (50.9%) patients had abdominal symptoms and 33 (30.0%) had a palpable abdominal mass. Surgery for localized and regional disease was associated with a disease-free survival time of at least 2 years in 28 of the 50 (56%) patients. Abdominal radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy, and 1,1 dichloro-2 (O-chlorophenyl)-2 (P-chlorophenyl) ethane (OPDDD) were effective in three of 19 (15.8%) patients, three of 31 (9.7%) patients, and 21 of 72 (29.2%) patients, respectively. Combined radiotherapy and OPDDD did not confer any additional benefit over OPDDD alone. Six of seven patients who received OPDDD as adjuvant treatment are still alive at 1 to 4 years. Distant metastases occurred most commonly in the lungs, liver, peritoneum, lymph nodes, and bones. Only 23% of the patients survived 5 years or more. We conclude that early diagnosis and complete surgical excision offer the best prospects for long-term survival and that the efficacy of adjuvant OPDDD needs to be evaluated further.\r"

Of 12 patients (60%) previously treated with chlorambucil and corticosteroids, nine responded to treatment. Toxicity was mild and the relapse rate particularly low. It was concluded that the MiNa protocol represents an effective chemotherapy for advanced and/or progressive CLL.\r"

Thirty-six patients with prior 5-FU exposure who were not eligible for other investigational therapeutic measures mainly due to extensive prior chemotherapy (median, four regimens) and poor performance status (median of 3, Zubrod scale) were enrolled. Thirty-four patients were evaluable for toxicity and 32 for response. Concurrent radiotherapy was given to 17 patients. The median duration of 5-FU treatment was 65 days (range, 19-508+) delivering a median cumulative 5-FU dose of 13.75 g/m2 (4.75-144.5+). The median number of interruptions of infusion was 1 (0-16) for a median of 7 days (1-25). One patient achieved complete remission, and four a partial response, for a median of 129 days (101-412) and a response rate of 16%. Five additional patients had a minor objective response (16%), whereas 15 (48%) had no change, and seven progressed (22%). The main toxicities seen were oral mucositis in 13 patients, hand-foot syndrome in six, Coombs'-positive hemolytic anemia in two, and progressive liver dysfunction in two patients who also had cirrhotic changes on computed tomography. Myelosuppression was uncommon and transient. Elective temporary interruptions of the 5-FU infusion diminished the incidence of mucocutaneous toxicity. Hemoglobin indices consistently displayed macrocytic features which did not readily revert to baseline after discontinuation of 5-FU infusion. Despite the adverse characteristics of the treated population, 5-FU infusion demonstrated moderate activity in refractory breast cancer with clinical resistance to prior 5-FU-containing regimens. Intermittent scheduled interruptions of infusion rendered this method of 5-FU delivery nontoxic.\r"

The authors studied the heart rate variability (HRV) of nine children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the different phases of cytostatic treatment utilizing heart rate processing techniques with a computer. The indices of HRV as well as the spectral components of heart rate were examined with special relation to vincristine administration. The heart rate variability was significantly reduced during the vincristine induction phases as compared to the consolidation and maintenance phases without vincristine administration. In particular, the respiratory components of the HRV during deep breathing tests were significantly reduced during vincristine treatment. The authors conclude that the measurement of the HRV is a suitable method for monitoring transient autonomic neuropathy, which these results show to be a frequent complication of vincristine treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-eight patients with high-grade cerebral gliomas (16 biopsy-proven and 12 diagnosed clinically and by computed tomography scan) were treated with altered fraction radiation and concomitant cisplatin (C-DDP). Twenty cases (Groups IA and IB) whose Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 60% or less received hypofractionation and C-DDP. All these patients had received high-dose Decadron (Merck Sharp & Dohme, West Point, PA), and their conditions were not improving or progressively deteriorating. The first 11 patients (Group IA) received from 600 cGy twice weekly to 3600 cGy over 3 weeks combined with C-DDP IV at 40 mg/M2 every 2 weeks for two courses. The nine subsequent patients (Group IB) received from 600 cGy weekly to 3600 cGy over 5 to 6 weeks with C-DDP IV at 40 mg/M2 every 1 to 2 weeks for four courses. The target volume in all cases was confined to the tumor as defined on computed tomography (CT) scan with a 2 cm to 3 cm margin. The C-DDP at 40 mg/M2 was administered immediately (within 5 minutes after radiation). Eight cases (Group II) with a KPS of more than 60% were treated with hyperfractionation, i.e., from 200 cGy twice daily to 4800 cGy in just under 3 weeks. The C-DDP was administered every 2 weeks for a total of two courses, as for Group IA. In Group I, 15 of 20 (75%) patients experienced rapid improvement in their performance status, which usually becoming evident within 1 to 2 weeks from the initiation of treatment, and progressed over time. Four patients with a KPS of 10% improved their KPS to over 60%. This regimen was both well tolerated and logistically very convenient both for the patients and attending staff. Follow-up CT scans in three of 16 evaluable patients in the hypofractionated group showed complete tumor resolution. Median survival for Group IA was 7 months, for Group IB was 12 months, and overall was eight months. The Group II median survival was 9 months. This experience suggests that hypofractionated radiation in combination with C-DDP may offer rapid palliation with improvement in functional status in severely compromised patients with malignant glioma.\r"

The microscopic changes were sufficiently striking to cause the primary pathologist to request consultation to rule out thyroid carcinoma in each case.

Recurrent tumors were successfully localized in 83% of patients by conventional methods, whereas immunoscintigraphy was expressive in 57% of cases. Immunoscintigraphy was disappointing especially because of its low sensitivity (23%) and low predictive value (positive, 33%; negative, 37%) with regard to successful diagnosis of extrahepatic tumors compared with the results of conventional methods (77% sensitivity; positive, 94%; negative, 79%). The rate of false-positive results was relatively high with immunoscintigraphy (n = 12), 83% of which were related to extrahepatic recurrent tumors. The value of immunoscintigraphy using an immunococktail of 131-J-labeled F(ab')2 fragments of monoclonal antibodies against CEA, with Ca 19-9 as an additional diagnostic tool for early detection of recurrent colorectal cancer, must therefore be viewed critically.\r"

Seventeen tumors were ER-positive, and the simultaneous expression of ER and DNA synthesis could be analyzed in 14 ER-positive tumors. DNA synthesis was measured through the thymidine labeling index (TLI). ER expression was detected by immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies. In these tumors, 38.6% +/- 13.1% of the cells were ER-positive (average TLI = 0.60% +/- 0.70%), as opposed to the presence of 61.4% +/- 13.1% of ER-negative cells (average TLI = 0.65% +/- 0.53%). In 12 of 14 tumors, both ER-positive and ER-negative cells were found to be engaged in DNA synthesis, whereas in two tumors only ER-negative cells were synthesizing DNA. On the basis of the TLI and the proportion of ER-negative and ER-positive cells in the total population, it is suggested that the ER-positive and ER-negative compartments are interrelated in most tumors. In five tumors, the ER-negative compartment would be a precursor of the ER-positive segment, whereas in six tumors the ER-positive segment appears to be a precursor of the ER-negative one. In three tumors, no evidence of an interrelationship between both segments could be found. In the 14 tumors analyzed, it also was found that 69.1% +/- 21.3% of the DNA-synthesizing cells were ER-negative; this probably accounts for the temporary remissions observed after hormonal treatment in breast cancer.\r"

The results were correlated to DNA content, histopathologic grade, and the presence or absence of invasion. Significant alterations in lectin binding associated with the development of cancer were found. A gradual loss of both PNA and WGA binding was found to correlate with higher grades of atypia (P less than 0.001). The loss of WGA binding was significantly correlated with both tumor aneuploidy (P less than 0.001) and the presence of invasion (P less than 0.05), whereas no significant correlation was found between loss of PNA binding and these variables. We concluded that the loss of WGA binding structures associated with bladder cancer shows a better correlation with known risk factors (aneuploidy and invasion) than the loss of PNA binding does.\r"

SFCC cells were continuously propagated in vitro during the past 29 months and grown in a monolayered sheet with a doubling time of about 67 hours. SFCC cells resembled the structure of the original tumor and had abundant glycogen granules, lipid droplets in the cytoplasm, and numerous microvilli. Immunohistochemically, SFCC cells had carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) immunoreactivity in some parts of the cell population. Moreover, they had a relatively high amount of progesterone receptor (20.0 fmol/mg protein; kd, 6.6 nM) but did not have either an estrogen receptor or EGF receptor. The SFCC cell line secreted a high content of tissue peptide antigen (TPA) into the medium, indicating that the SFCC cell line is useful for analyzing the progesterone receptor and TPA production in clear cell adenocarcinoma of uterine cervix.\r"

Significant correlations of these karyotypic groups with the age of the patients and histologic subgroups of the pleomorphic adenomas were found.

The tumor, located 7 cm below the vocal cord and 5 cm above the carina, was an intraluminally protruding polypoid mass that measured 1.5 X 1.2 cm and arose from the posterior wall of the trachea with a broad base. Microscopically, the tumor was predominantly of the solid type, but a small proportion of a glomangiomatous component was admixed. Ultrastructural study confirmed the presence of myofibrillar bundles with focal densities and fine pinocytotic vesicles along the plasma membrane. A structure similar to a nonneoplastic glomus was demonstrated in the submucosal layer of the posterior wall away from the tumor margin. This suggests that the tracheal glomus tumor occurs more often in the posterior wall where neuromuscular complex structures may develop more readily.\r"

The DNA ploidy pattern was compared with a variety of histologic parameters and the subsequent clinical course to determine whether or not this pattern is associated with the mode of malignant potentiality. Of the 31 patients, eight had the diploidy DNA pattern and 23 the aneuploid DNA pattern. Tumors with the aneuploidy DNA pattern had a significantly higher frequency of lymph node metastasis than did those with the diploidy DNA pattern (P less than 0.01). Mitotic rates in the aneuploid tumors were significantly higher than was the case in diploid tumors (P less than 0.0005). The incidence of recurrence within 12 months after surgery was higher in patients with aneuploid tumors (83.3%) than in those with diploid ones (16.7%), with a statistical difference (P less than 0.05). Thus, the DNA aneuploidy based on flow cytometry closely correlates with the high frequency of nodal involvement and high mitotic rates, factors generally indicative of the aggressive behavior of the malignant tumors. DNA aneuploidy based on flow cytometric analysis is a pertinent index for determining the highly malignant potential in esophageal carcinoma.\r"

Histopathologic material was available in 59 instances, of which 22 were autopsy cases and 28 were incidental findings at therapeutic oophorectomy. The patients' ages ranged from 25 to 80 years (average, 48.6 years). Sixty-four percent of the metastases were bilateral and 36% were unilateral. An ovarian metastasis was detected before the breast cancer in only one instance. The median interval between the diagnosis of breast carcinoma and the ovarian metastasis was 11.5 months and was related to the initial stage of the breast disease. The median survival after the diagnosis of ovarian metastasis was 16 months. The ovaries were grossly normal in 27 (46%) cases and 18 (31%) metastases were less than 1 mm in diameter. The size of the metastases was not related to the interval after the diagnosis of the breast carcinoma and did not influence the outcome of the patients. Forty-four metastases (75%) showed an indian file or ductal patterns easily identifiable as metastases of breast origin. The remaining cases presented various histologic features mimicking primary ovarian tumors or tumor-like conditions such as stromal luteoma, hyperthecosis, dysgerminoma, granulosa cell tumor, and carcinoid tumor. No metastasis had features of Krukenberg tumor. The authors conclude that metastases from breast cancer are generally small and are the reflection of an advanced disease. A metastasis of breast origin can be suspected histologically in most cases.\r"

The ovarian tumor was unilateral in one case and bilateral in the other. One primary site was the right foot and the other primary site was the left forearm. These cases illustrate that metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma rarely enters into the differential diagnosis of a small cell malignant tumor of the ovary.

  ".W": "Ovarian tumors of low malignant potential or of borderline malignancy are characterized histologically by the association of malignant type of epithelial proliferation with a noninvasive pattern of growth. Because epithelial proliferation relates to features of nuclear morphology and chromatin structure and because of the difficulties to distinguish nuclear atypism seen in borderline malignancy from that in frankly invasive tumors by usual microscopic study, the authors concentrated their studies exclusively on computerized analysis of cell nuclei images. Using specially developed methods of analysis the authors described geometrical, optical, and structural differences among the epithelial and stromal cell nuclei of benign, borderline, and malignant ovarian tumors. The structural differences concern the pattern of chromatin condensation and suggest that the cytokinetic properties of the borderline tumors are intermediate to those of benign and malignant. The results demonstrate that the quantitative evaluations provide objective and reproducible data useful in the differential diagnostic of the borderline malignancy.\r"

Among the specimens classified as diploid or questionable by flow cytometry, 14 showed the presence of aneuploid DNA values documented by image analysis. In 18 of the 50 patients, recurrent tumors were observed during a relatively brief period of follow-up. In 15 of them the DNA pattern was aneuploid and in three it was questionable. In nine of the 15 patients, both methods of DNA analysis disclosed aneuploidy, but in six patients aneuploidy was detected by image analysis only. A combination of DNA aneuploidy, whether observed by flow cytometry, image analysis, or both, and of positive or suspicious urine cytology is highly predictive of recurrence of high grade bladder tumors. Image analysis of DNA content in bladder washings adds information of clinical value above and beyond that obtained by flow cytometry.\r"

  ".W": "Most squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity and oropharynx are not diagnosed until they have attained at least the T2 stage (greater than 2.0 cm). This study identifies factors which may contribute to the delayed diagnosis of these tumors, despite the fact that they frequently arise at sites readily accessible to examination. Personal interviews of 149 patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma revealed delays by patients of one day to more than one year (mean, 17 weeks) before seeking care. Furthermore, delay by doctors occurred in 45 instances (30%). Neither short nor long delays had a statistically significant relationship to tumor T stage at the time of diagnosis. The length of patient delay was also not related to age, gender, amount of education, or history of alcohol consumption. The authors concluded that the early carcinomas were probably asymptomatic and subsequent manifestations were commonly misinterpreted as benign or innocuous oral/dental problems. These inconspicuous or misleading perceptions may be primarily responsible for the advanced stages of these tumors at the time of discovery. Emphasis must, therefore, be placed upon gaining access to high-risk individuals for periodic oral and oropharyngeal examinations and upon educational efforts to increase the skill of primary health care providers in recognizing this problem.\r"

Thirty-four of them (91.9%) were not accompanied by adenoma, and were thought to have arisen de novo. There is indeed a de novo route of cancer development in the human large intestine, and cancers de novo merely show polypoid growth. Flat type cancers arising de novo tend to reach deeper layers at an earlier stage than polypoid-type carcinomas in adenoma. Of those with a diameter of less than 10 mm, only 40% stayed in the mucosa. Consequently, advanced cancers cannot be prevented by snare polypectomy alone. More attention should be directed to the discovery of small, flat, nonpolypoid cancers.\r"

Univariate descriptive analysis with chi-square test and multivariate analysis with logistic regression were applied to find the significant risk factors related to cervical cancer in Taiwan. Comparison of Phase I and II screening revealed a cohort effect. The high examination rate in women aged 30 to 39 years in Phase I resulted in a drop in the suspicious rate in the 35 to 44 year age group in Phase II, and a decreasing trend of age-specific death rates from both cervical and uterine cancer in the 40 to 49 year age group based on all of the female population in Taiwan. In Phase II, an increasing trend in ratio of carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma was also found. These findings suggest that the 10-year screening program in Taiwan conducted by the Cancer Society of the Republic of China has been effective. How to increase the examination rate is the key issue in the control of cervical cancer in Taiwan.\r"

Consecutive patients 40 to 80 years of age with invasive breast cancer of Stages I and II were eligible for the study. Of 161 women, 99 agreed to participate; 37 received breast-conserving treatment and 62 received a modified radical mastectomy. The study method consisted of a semistructured interview at 4 and 13 months after primary treatment based on the Social Adjustment Scale (SAS) and two scales for the estimation of anxiety, depression, and adjustment to a sexual relationship. The women's ratings in the SAS inventory for adjustment to work, social life, marriage, sexual relationship, and parental role showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups. In the interviewer's global rating in the SAS protocol of the overall adjustment after 13 months, 22.0% of the women in the mastectomy group versus 5.4% of those with a preserved breast were rated as having significant disturbances. A statistically nonsignificant tendency (P greater than 0.05) emerged for the other ratings in the interviewer's assessment in SAS and in the estimation of anxiety, depression, and adjustment to sexual relationships. The consistent tendency indicates that there might be clinically important differences in the psychosocial adjustment after the two treatment methods. Larger trials focused more sensitively on the problems after breast loss versus breast preservation in breast cancer surgery are needed to further explore this field.\r"

The fact that the staff members almost uniformly rated their satisfaction as high (8.2 on a scale of 1 to 10) precluded the detection of discriminating variables. Satisfaction with the way they met their goals also was high; most identified potentially achievable goals, relied heavily on the interdisciplinary team, and experienced changes in their attitudes and approach during their first 2 years in the field, primarily increased realism. A major discomfort for physicians was the inability to provide optimal care. Ethical issues were a major discomfort for nurses. Death itself and staff conflict were less important sources of discomfort than in previous reports.\r"

No patient required a mandibulotomy for access and no benign tumour recurred.

We have reviewed 15 children with pseudohypacusis, who had an average loss in the right ear of 57 dB, and of 59 dB in the left ear when tested by pure tone audiometry. Eight children were diagnosed by clinical impression and inconsistent pure tone audiograms but in order to confirm the diagnosis in the other seven children further testing with a speech audiogram was necessary and proved sufficient to establish the diagnosis in all cases. The hearing of all 15 children resolved spontaneously at between 2 and 70 months, when treated by careful monitoring and supportive therapy, and none of the children needed psychiatric referral.\r"

In 157 patients the ability to equilibrate a static air pressure of plus or minus 200 mm of water passively or actively was tested. It turned out that in those 15% who could equilibrate minus 200 mm passively a 7 times higher rate of successful myringoplasty was found. Ears with cholesteatoma showed less ability to equilibrate actively. Despite these findings it is concluded that the present tests are insufficient for clinical use.\r"

This study examines radiological parameters to determine whether skeletal or soft tissue factors within the skull base or nasopharynx could be implicated as a cause or diagnostic feature of Eustachian tube dysfunction. The nasopharynx tended to be smaller in those with Down's syndrome and this resulted in a reduction in the airway size due to encroachment by the soft tissues.

During follow-up 4 patients were found to have malignancies that in retrospect had been responsible for their vocal cord paralysis. Of the remainder approximately half either recovered vocal cord function or regained a near normal voice due to compensatory movement by the non-paralysed cord. No patient over the age of 60 compensated. No patient either recovered vocal cord function or compensated more than 12 months after the onset of his paralysis. In conclusion, patients with an idiopathic vocal cord paralysis should be suspected of harbouring a malignancy unless vocal cord mobility recovers, and management of the laryngeal dysfunction should be expectant for up to 12 months.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluates the degree of objectively quantified physical deconditioning of spinal surgery patients. The object is to evaluate the data in terms of the pain and disability claimed by 35 male and 11 female patients three months after spinal surgery. Among the males, two subgroups (i.e., disc excision or spinal fusion) were evaluated. All patients reported subjective indices of pain/disability and completed quantified tests of lumbar motion, sagittal trunk strength, lifting capacity, and bicycle ergometry. In general, true lumbar motion was markedly restricted to 50%-60% and trunk strength means were below 50% of gender-specific normative values. There were similar deficits for lifting capacity. Those who had spinal fusions tended to perform poorly, with a relatively high incidence of pain/disability. There were no differences found between the male group and subgroups who were gainfully employed or had a brief period of disability prior to surgery or had low subjective pain/disability. These results indicate that a patient's subjective pain/disability were not a reliable measure of functional capacity by three months postoperatively. Regardless of working status, pain level, or brevity of disability, there was a significant loss of performance ability and risk of persistent dysfunction after surgical treatment.\r"

  ".W": "From 1983 to 1987, 100 consecutive patients with lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus were treated with either chymopapain chemonucleolysis (51 patients) or surgical discectomy (49 patients). The chymopapain-treated group was followed for an average of 16 months and the surgically treated group was followed for an average of 12 months. All patients had to be candidates for both procedures and were grouped for therapy based on their preference. The groups were similar in military duty status, history, age, gender, duration and character of symptoms, physical findings, and computed tomography/myelogram results. Satisfactory outcomes were achieved in 40 of 51 (78%) chymopapain-treated patients and in 39 of 49 (80%) surgically treated patients. Seventy-eight percent of the chymopapain group and 79% of the surgery group ultimately returned to full military duty. Of the nine initial chymopapain failures, eight were successfully treated with surgical discectomy. There were fewer complications, 4% versus 10%, in the chymopapain group. The authors now consider chemonucleolysis as the final conservative measure prior to surgery, rather than an alternative to surgical discectomy.\r"

Small nerve twigs to the coracobrachialis (proximal to the main nerve trunk) entered the muscle as close as 17 mm below the coracoid, with an average of 31 mm. The frequently cited range of 5-8 cm below the coracoid for the level of penetration cannot be relied on to describe a safe zone because 29% of the nerves entered the muscle proximal to 5 cm below the coracoid (74% if the proximal twigs are counted). If coracoid mobilization is necessary, the musculocutaneous nerve and its twigs should be identified and protected, keeping in mind the variations in anatomy and the level of penetration.\r"

Upward migration of the humeral head was measured by noting any reduction in the acromiohumeral distance in roentgenograms of the shoulder. There was a statistically significant decrease in the acromiohumeral interval on tensing the short head of biceps, but there was no significant change in the interval on tensing either the long head or both heads of the biceps brachii. Severing the tendon of the long head while both the heads were tensed caused a significant upward migration of the head of the humerus. One of the important functions of the long head of the biceps is to stabilize the humeral head in the glenoid during powerful elbow flexion and forearm supination by the main muscle. Sacrifice of the intraarticular segment of this tendon in surgical procedures of the shoulder may produce instability and dysfunction.\r"

The 29 ON hips were followed for an average of seven years. Comparing the ON and OA groups, the patient profiles were similar, except for weight and sex. For the ON group, hip scores according to the Merle D'Aubigne system (18 points for a normal hip) were improved from 9.8 preoperatively to 14.3 at the latest survey. However, 14 hips (48%) presented unsatisfactory clinical results, and roentgenologically all showed aseptic component loosening. Such a failure rate was higher than that for the OA group (33%); similarly, femoral component loosening occurred more frequently in the ON (28%) than in the OA group (5%). Based on the analysis of the patient profiles, Stage 3 ON at surgery, bilateral occurrence of the disease and bilateral THA could have caused such a failure in the ON group. In addition, most of the hips with component loosening showed histologic evidence of extensive bone necrosis within the resected femoral head. ON is a high-risk disease in terms of the long-term durability of THA, the failure of which seems to be mainly caused by extensive necrosis.\r"

Macerated coronal slices were examined with a dissecting microscope, and the TMFs were identified where there was callus formation, either nodular or smooth. The number of TMFs did not differ significantly in the SFFN and age-matched control groups. The number of TMFs in the OA group was lower than in SFFN and age-matched control groups. The numbers of nodular TMFs in the control and SFFN groups did not differ significantly but were fewer in the OA group. Smooth TMFs were present in similar numbers in OA, control, and SFFN groups. The ratio of the nodular to smooth TMFs regressed with age. The greater proportion of nodular TMFs in older patients was indicative of an early stage of woven bone callus formation. In all three groups (excluding controls younger than 50 years of age), TMFs tended to appear some distance from the midpoint of the trabeculae. The number of TMFs in trabeculae parallel and perpendicular to the direction of principal stress was similar in all three groups.\r"

Somatomedin-C activity in affected boys and girls between six and 11 years of age was normal compared to the standard data on normal children.

  ".W": "Forty-seven patients with a chronic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency were treated with patella tendon ACL reconstructions from July 1980 to September 1983. All patients had a minimum two-year follow-up period (range, 24-54 months). Forty-two patients (89%) had meniscal damage in association with the ACL deficiency. This included seven menisci (17%) that had a stable tear and were left in place without suture fixation. Only five patients (11%) had normal menisci at the time of reconstruction. Functional and subjective results were obtained from a questionnaire that included a comprehensive evaluation of patients' symptoms and activities. Objective results were analyzed on the basis of a thorough physical examination, augmented with arthrometer instrumented drawer testing. The detailed questionnaire was returned by 42 patients (89%). Follow-up examinations were obtained for 37 patients (79%), with arthrometer testing of 35 patients (75%). A 100-point rating scale defined objective, subjective, and functional results. Stability testing, using Lachman's test, was judged to be less than or equal to 5 mm of anteroposterior tibiofemoral translation in 51% of the patients examined and less than or equal to 10 mm of translation in 89%. Stability by arthrometer testing was less than or equal to 5 mm side-to-side difference in 83%. No patient lost a menisci after reconstruction. This included six patients with stable tears that were left unsutured. Subjective results were good or better in 60%. Functional results were good or better in 52%, with 41 of 42 patients participating in some form of recreational sports postoperatively. There was a large discrepancy between objective findings and the subjective and functional results (14% poor results compared with 31% and 43%, respectively). Although objective stability could be surgically restored in an ACL-deficient knee, the quality of the knee at the time of reconstruction as well as the postoperative and rehabilitative regimen are implicated in patients with poor subjective and functional results.\r"

Follow-up study was from two and one-half years to four years. Four ruptures occurred in patients who had had a distal patellar realignment procedure, and one occurred after knee manipulation. Only two xenograft reconstructions and two of four staple fixation procedures were successful. After treatment of the patellar tendon rupture, four knees developed deep infection. Avoidance of this complication seems paramount because the results of treatment are discouraging. Patients at high risk at the time of the initial TKA seem to be those with limited preoperative motion in whom surgical exposure is difficult.\r"

There was no significant difference in the range of motion during the eight days of hospitalization or the follow-up visits at two weeks, two months, six months, and one year. There was a significant decrease in the swelling about the knee. The continuous passive motion treated knees appeared to be generally weaker as revealed by more extensor lags and flexor tightness at discharge from the hospital. Also, increased costs incurred from the need for additional equipment and increased staff time made the machine neither cost-effective nor beneficial.\r"

Treatment duration was three weeks. Mechanical testing yielded values for elastic modulus, stiffness, stress, strain, and strain energy density at linear and maximum loads. Hydroxyproline concentrations were measured to determine tendon collagen content. Findings indicated that cyclic tensile loading of tendons by CPM lessened the harmful effects of immobilization. Linear load and stress for CPM and control tendons were similar, while the same measures for immobilized tendons were 16% and 25% less than control tendons. Ultimate strength of the control tendons, however, exceeded CPM tendons by 16% and immobilized tendons by 20%. Hydroxyproline levels were comparable for the CPM, control, and immobilized tissues. For a short duration (three weeks), CPM reduced the detrimental effects of immobilization in the tendon, primarily in the linear-load region.\r"

Ten femoral heads removed from skeletally immature pigs were stored at 37 degrees in a sealed, sterile container during the observation period. Imaging was initially performed 40 minutes after excision (base-line) and repeated at six, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Changes in MR signal intensity were measured, and the T1 and T2 relaxation times were calculated for selected epiphyseal and metaphyseal areas. Signal intensities decreased during the first 24 hours and returned to baseline by 72 hours. T1 relaxation time increased most significantly between baseline and 24 hours and then decreased to near baseline level between 48 and 72 hours. T2 changes over time were not statistically significant. The type of localized, distinctive decreases in MR signal intensity occurring in clinical cases of early nontraumatic femoral head osteonecrosis was not observed in pigs. Such changes appear to require the presence of an intact and vigorous repair response within adjacent viable bone. However, the transient decrease in signal intensity and prolongation of T1 relaxation time at 12, 24, and 48 hours after traumatic vascular insult may be indicators of early femoral head ischemia.\r"

In vitro marrow stromal cells (MSC) attached initially to upper portions of ceramic discs. However, at four weeks, cells only attached to disc edges. Fresh marrow or first passage MSC, inoculated into diffusion chambers with and without Si3N4, formed cartilage, bone, and fibrous tissue after being implanted intraperitoneally for five weeks. Tissue differentiated adjacent to Si3N4 but not within the pores. In contrast, Si3N4 implants inserted into femoral marrow cavities were surrounded initially by woven bone and within three months by mature bone that had permeated implants with a pore size of 255 +/- 64 microns. Plugs having a pore diameter of 170 +/- 45 microns mainly contained vascularized fibrous tissue with occasional foci of osteoid or bone in the peripheral pores. In a pilot experiment, three femoral segmental Si3N4 endoprostheses were implanted in three adult rabbits, and the osseous reactions were monitored during their natural life. Each implant was enclosed by a stable cuff of bone within four months of implantation and remained unchanged during the rest of the animal's life. Autopsies confirmed these roentgenographic observations, and tissue appositional to each prosthesis was morphologically normal. Si3N4 has the potential of an important ceramic for use in osseous reconstruction.\r"

The clinical scenario is completed by the association of this osteomalacic state with the finding of a neoplastic process in the afflicted patient. The authors report a patient in whom the diagnosis of oncogenic osteomalacia was established and treatment begun despite the fact that the associated tumor (benign undifferentiated tumor of meschymal origin) escaped detection for many months. Following discovery of the tumor and identification by magnetic resonance imaging, the patient was cured by surgical resection.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to depict the morphologic features of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head and to determine whether a classification based on stage of necrosis is possible, images of hips with 56 proved lesions were examined and correlated with roentgenographic stage, severity of pain and functional impairment, and available computed tomography (CT) scans. Six femoral heads with AVN were also studied ex vivo with MRI, CT, roentgenographic, and histologic examinations. These examinations were compared with 100 normal hips in 50 individuals and one normal proximal femoral specimen. The reactive interface between live and dead bone at the periphery of AVN lesions had a characteristic MRI appearance that facilitated diagnosis. Based on central signal intensity on two different pulse sequences, lesions could be separated into four classes that correlated with roentgenographic and clinical staging. Lesions that were isointense with fat on both sequences had an earlier roentgenographic stage and less severe symptoms than did lesions that were less intense than fat. Among hips with AVN in patients younger than 50 years of age, 67% had premature conversion to fatty intertrochanteric marrow outside the borders of the lesion. Detecting premature conversion to fatty marrow has important implications regarding the pathogenesis of AVN and may aid early diagnosis. MRI provides pathophysiologic information that is different from information obtained from conventional methods or various combinations of methods and may provide a basis for an improved system for grading AVN lesions.\r"

Subjects received single doses of either 0.2 or 2 mg of orally administered MK-912 or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, balanced, crossover design. Clonidine was infused intravenously over 10 minutes, 1 hour after dosing, and observations were made for 8 hours. The 2 mg dose of MK-912 significantly inhibited the clonidine-induced hypotension, bradycardia, xerostomia, and increase in plasma glucose concentrations that were observed during the placebo treatment period (p less than 0.05). The peak elevation in plasma growth hormone that was produced by clonidine on the day the placebo was given was inhibited an average of 87% by the 2 mg dose of MK-912 (p less than 0.01). Although there was a trend toward antagonism of clonidine by the 0.2 mg dose of MK-912, statistically significant differences from placebo were not consistently demonstrated for most parameters. However, a mean 59% inhibition of the clonidine-induced peak elevation of plasma growth hormone was observed (p less than 0.05). Oral MK-912 almost completely inhibits the effect of 200 micrograms of intravenous clonidine in human subjects, which is consistent with its role as a potent alpha 2-antagonist over the dose range of 0.2 to 2.0 mg.\r"

Half-life as determined for the oral route was, in all subjects, 15% to 35% less than that determined for the intravenous route. Free oral clearance was slightly but not significantly less than free systemic clearance, but the ratio of the AUC of lorazepam glucuronide corrected for dose was twofold greater by the oral route. Urinary recoveries also differed (71.6% and 50.4%, oral versus intravenous). Neomycin and cholestyramine treatment resulted in a 19% to 26% reduction in half-life attendant on a 34% increase in free oral clearance and a 24% increase in free systemic clearance. This suggests that lorazepam undergoes significant enterohepatic recirculation in human beings and that there exists an extrahepatic pathway, at least for the intravenous route. Since pharmacokinetic measurements do not take these physiologic processes into account, the drug cannot properly be used as a marker of conjugative metabolism.\r"

Serum AUC increased from 245 +/- 37.6 to 342 +/- 87.3 mg.hr/L (p = 0.007); area under the first moment curve increased from 5666 +/- 1003 to 11,632 +/- 4198 mg.hr2/L (p = 0.008); the time-averaged total body clearance decreased from 1.57 +/- 0.3 to 1.17 +/- 0.33 L/hr (p = 0.0004); and the apparent elimination half-life increased from 16.1 +/- 1.32 to 22.6 +/- 3.8 hours (p = 0.001) for phenytoin during phase II. The volume of distribution at steady state and the unbound fraction for phenytoin remained unchanged. However, the formation of p-hydroxyphenytoin as a function of serum phenytoin concentration decreased during phase II. These findings suggest that amiodarone inhibits phenytoin metabolism. These observations also suggest that phenytoin doses will need to be reduced when coadministered with amiodarone. The magnitude of this reduction is difficult to predict because of the saturable pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, and therapeutic monitoring is recommended if amiodarone is added to the phenytoin regimen.\r"

According to the current procedure sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration, each patient is given one of several possible doses, including placebo, after an initial placebo run-in period. Data analysis is based on a model in which the mean response at each dose is independent of the magnitude of the dose. The initial dose is the lowest dose tested that has a response that is statistically significantly greater than the response after placebo administration. We suggest that the present conceptual approach to, and standard study design and analysis for, dose-ranging studies be changed. We believe one must begin with a parametric model for patient-specific dose-response curves. Knowledge of the distribution of these curves in a population provides a basis for choice of an initial dose (e.g., the dose that achieves a given response in a given fraction of patients) and, after observation of response to an initial dose, for choice of an incremental dose for a specific patient (by use of Bayes rule). The current parallel-dose design can provide only poor information about the distribution of dose-response curves, biased estimates of the typical curve, and little information on interpatient variability. Crossover studies provide better information. In studies in which a parametric patient-specific dose-response model is used, a dose-escalation design provides no less information than a crossover design, and it has ethical advantages that allow a more representative patient group and clinical setting to be studied.\r"

Intramucosal tissue pH was measured using pH-sensitive antimony microelectrodes, and mucosal blood flow was measured by the radiolabeled microsphere technique. 16,16-dm PGE2 (5 micrograms/ml topically) significantly protected the gastric mucosa against gross (lesion index 2.25 +/- 0.34 vs 0.87 +/- 0.21) and microscopic (lesion index 2.12 +/- 0.20 vs 0.87 +/- 0.09) damage during the shock. This protection was associated with a significantly lesser acidification of the mucosa during the shock (intramural tissue pH 6.67 +/- 0.08 vs 6.03 +/- 0.17). In order to elucidate whether the lesser intramucosal acidification was due to diminished entry of H+ (H+ back diffusion) into or better disposal of H+ from the mucosa, the influences of 16,16-dm PGE2 on transmucosal H+ fluxes and mucosal blood flow were determined. It appeared that 16,16-dm PGE2 had no influence on the rate of H+ back-diffusion, but it significantly enhanced mucosal blood flow both in the corpus (0.23 +/- 0.04 vs 0.14 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g) and in the antrum (0.24 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.14 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g) during the shock.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Gastric ulcers were induced by the submucosal injection of 20% acetic acid (0.03 ml) into the antral-oxyntic border of the anterior wall of male Donryu rats (260-280 g). The healing of acetic acid ulcers was delayed by the daily subcutaneous administration of indomethacin (1 mg/kg) for two or four weeks after ulceration. Aggravation of healed ulcers was evoked by subcutaneous administration of indomethacin (1 mg/kg) once daily for four weeks to rats with four-week-old ulcers. Oral administration of NC-1300 (10, 30, or 100 mg/kg) once daily for two or four weeks after ulceration dose-dependently accelerated both natural and delayed healing of acetic acid ulcers. When the period of administration was extended from two to four weeks, the ED50 values (the dose reducing the ulcerated area by 50%) were decreased from 36.5 to 13.5 mg/kg in natural healing and from 76.0 to 23.0 mg/kg in delayed healing. Aggravation of four-week-old ulcers by indomethacin was significantly prevented by daily administration of NC-1300 (30 or 100 mg/kg) for four weeks. Acetic acid ulcers that were healed with NC-1300 given for four weeks after ulceration remained healed for four to eight weeks after the cessation of drug administration. A single administration of NC-1300 to normal rats and repeated administration of NC-1300 to rats with acetic acid ulcers for four weeks after ulceration caused the same degree of inhibition of gastric acid secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They were randomized to receive either placebo, cimetidine 800 mg, ranitidine 150 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or nizatidine 150 mg, given at 2200 hr in double-blind fashion. All H2-receptor blockers were more effective than placebo in suppressing both circadian (P less than 0.05-P less than 0.01) and nocturnal (P less than 0.002) gastric acidity, while there was no significant differences between the effects of the four active drugs in the same time periods. The percentage of nocturnal acid inhibition (2300-0800 hr) over placebo in terms of H+ values was virtually 100% with all active treatments. The effect on daytime (0800-1700 hr) and evening (1700-2300 hr) acidity of both placebo and the four H2-receptor antagonists was similar. Therefore, in the above doses H2-receptor blockers guarantee overnight anacidity to a similar degree and cause the physiological buffering of daily meals on gastric acidity to be fully exploited. Furthermore, the reducing effect of daily meals on drug action can be prevented. Since strong acid suppression strictly confined to the nocturnal period has been shown to be closely correlated with the highest ulcer healing rates, it is suggested that single low bedtime doses of H2-receptor antagonist should be evaluated in the acute treatment of duodenal ulcer.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic laser photocoagulation of ulcers is increasingly used to produce hemostasis in patients who are actively bleeding or in patients with stigmata of recent hemorrhage. Little information is available describing ulcer healing rates after laser treatments. The aim of this study was to compare the healing rates of gastric ulcers treated with laser energy (Nd:YAG) with untreated ulcers in dogs. Two standard gastric ulcers (12-14 mm diameter) were created in each dog stomach using an ulcer maker (Quinton) under endoscopic guidance and one was randomly selected for laser treatment (L), while the other served as control (C). Ten laser spots were applied circumferentially around the ulcer crater with a mean energy of 595 J per ulcer. Ten dogs were studied; four of which were sacrificed after one week and six after two weeks. Healing of treated ulcers was compared with that of control ulcers and expressed as a percentage of the initial ulcer surface. Histologic injury and reepithelialization were scored by two pathologists unaware of the treatment. Laser-treated ulcers healed significantly slower than untreated ulcers at one week (53% L vs 94% C, P less than 0.05) and histologic injury was greater in ulcers treated with laser photocoagulation. At two weeks, only 82% of the laser-treated ulcer surface was healed in comparison with 94% (P less than 0.05) healing in untreated ulcers, although the mean histologic injury score was not different at two weeks. Reepithelialization was decreased both at one week (11% L vs 71% C, P less than 0.01) and at two weeks (75% L vs 100% C, P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was the aim of this study to assess the acute effects of cisapride on antroduodenal motility and duodenogastric reflux in seven patients with severe dyspepsia and increased biliary reflux, as evidenced by increased bile salt output in their gastric aspirates. Each patient underwent two studies on separate days. On each day, after an overnight fast, each patient swallowed a multilumen tube for manometric recording of gastroduodenal motility. Phenol red was infused into the second portion of the duodenum, gastric juice was aspirated, and motor activity was monitored for 90 min. At the end of this period, the patient received either cisapride or placebo intravenously in a double-blind randomized fashion. Antroduodenal motility and duodenogastric reflux were monitored for the subsequent 90 min. A significantly (P less than 0.01) higher motility index was found in the antrum after cisapride (2678 +/- 712 vs 1110 +/- 412 in the basal period) while placebo had no effect. The duodenal motility index was not affected by cisapride or placebo. Bile salt outputs in gastric aspirates were significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced following cisapride injection (0.42 +/- 0.6 mmol vs 1.6 +/- 1.2 mmol during basal period). Conversely, outputs of phenol red in the gastric aspirates were unaffected by cisapride. In conclusion, cisapride stimulates antral motility and decreases biliary reflux in patients with dyspepsia and increased duodenogastric reflux.\r"

In the present study we describe 16 patients with HLES, defined as a lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure of greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg (mean + 3 SD of controls) with normal peristalsis. All of the patients suffered from chest pain and nine from dysphagia. Delayed bolus transit at the gastroesophageal junction was demonstrated in four patients by radiography. Manometric studies showed that during swallowing the LES residual pressures were significantly greater (9.2 +/- 5.0 mm Hg) than observed in normal controls (1.8 +/- 2.2 mmHg) (mean +/- 1 SD). However, the percent LES relaxation in patients did not differ significantly from controls. Clinical improvement was associated with pharmacological or mechanical reduction of resting LES pressure with an accompanying fall in the nadir pressure. These observations suggest that HLES may have clinical and pathophysiological significance and that evidence for the entity should be sought during manometric studies in the clinical laboratory.\r"

In contrast, none of the seven patients with esophagitis had a positive image (specificity 100%). Pentagastrin did not have a significant effect on the sensitivity. There was no correlation between the type of Barrett's epithelium and the sensitivity of the imaging results. However, the test is more frequently positive in those patients with more extensive disease. Our study indicates that technetium pertechnetate imaging should not be used as a screening test for the detection of Barrett's esophagus in patients with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, as the negative predictive value of the test is limited.\r"

Two pH probes were placed in the esophagus of supine anesthetized dogs and acid was infused in small serial volumes from an infusion tube placed at the gastroesophageal junction. Two general patterns of pH probe responses were seen: (1) neither probe recorded a fall in pH with acid infusion, and (2) both probes recorded a fall in pH, but in a nonsynchronous manner. Changing the relationship of the tips of the probes with respect to the adjacent mucosa caused a fall in the pH recorded by each probe to the pH of the intraesophageal infusate. This and other evidence seen in the pH tracings suggest that mucosal abutment of the probe tips causes a falsely negative pH recording and raises the question of whether such a phenomenon occurs in human studies.\r"

The similar prevalence of lactase deficiency in the Singapore- and the Canadian-born Chinese despite a larger estimated amount of daily milk ingestion in the Canadian-born Chinese (430 ml vs 157 ml) supports the concept that lactase deficiency, which is transmitted genetically, does not have an adaptable component related to the quantity of lactose ingested. When the lactose breath hydrogen test performed with a dose of 0.5 g/kg of lactose was compared with the test using a standard dose of 50 g of lactose, there was very little loss of sensitivity. In spite of the presence of lactase deficiency, only 32% of the Singapore subjects and 23% of the Canadian subjects had gastrointestinal symptoms when milk was ingested in the daily diet. Peak breath H2 was higher in females than males, but the difference was more significant in the Canadian cohort.\r"

We prospectively studied eight patients with IBD, seven of whom had little or no disease activity, to determine if they had any laboratory abnormality known to be associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Abnormalities in fibrinolysis were noted in five patients: four with high plasminogen activator inhibitor levels and one with poor release of tissue plasminogen activator following venous occlusion. Circulating immune complexes were present in the sera of five patients. Fibrinogen was mildly elevated in one patient, and two patients had mild thrombocytosis. Decreased levels of antithrombin III, protein C, or protein S were not observed. There appears to be a high incidence of abnormalities in fibrinolysis in inactive IBD, which may contribute to the high frequency of thrombosis seen in IBD. The presence of circulating immune complexes may contribute to vascular injury and thrombosis.\r"

To estimate the incidence of metabolic bone disease by noninvasive methods, 31 patients (17-75 years old) with Crohn's disease and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in winter were investigated in the following summer by measuring the bone mineral content (BMC) of the distal radius by single photon absorptiometry and the cortical area ratio (CAR) calculated from radiographs of the right hand and by x-ray of the lumbar spine. Forty-five percent of the patients showed signs of metabolic bone disease. BMC and CAR correlated with 25-OHD serum levels (P less than 0.05), especially in men. Furthermore, the amount of sun exposure has an influence not only on 25-OHD serum levels both in summer and in winter (P = 0.0006), but also on the BMC (P = 0.07). Consequently, vitamin D deficiency is of major importance for the development of metabolic bone disease in patients with Crohn's disease. Vitamin D deficiency can be prevented by increasing sun exposure and long-term vitamin D supplementation.\r"

Linoleic acid and glucose absorption decreased with increasing concentrations of pectin. The reduction in linoleic acid absorption was not caused by binding of linoleic acids by pectin or impaired micelle formation due to binding of bile acid by pectin. The unstirred water layer expanded with increasing concentrations of pectin. These results suggest that enlargement of the unstirred water layer is closely associated with the reduction of absorption of fatty acid and glucose ingested with pectin.\r"

Serosal electrodes were surgically implanted on stomach, duodenum, and jejunum during Nissen fundoplication and ileostomy. A 5-cm ileal specimen was taken for in vitro studies. Spontaneous migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC) were present in stomach and small intestine. Bethanechol increased electrical response activity (ERA) in stomach and duodenum. Morphine induced intense ERA and distinct phase III activity. Pentagastrin infusion did not disrupt MMC cycling. Feeding disrupted MMC complex cycling 30-40 min after the meal. Metoclopramide before feeding delayed disruption of the MMC cycling after the feeding. Intermittent gastric arrhythmias were present after the fifth postoperative day. In vitro muscle strips showed spontaneous contractions and electrical control activity (ECA). Bethanechol, McNeil A-343, motilin, and cholecystokinin induced contractions, but pentagastrin had no effect. We conclude that in spite of a major clinical motility dysfunction, several of our findings were normal. The abnormalities include short MMC period, absence of disruption of MMC by pentagastrin, and gastric arrhythmias.\r"

Frozen semen was used with either glycerol or TEST-yolk (TEST-buffered 20% egg yolk with 10% glycerol) as the cryoprotectant. Cryopreservation resulted in significant decreases in all semen parameters measured. Of these, velocity appeared to be the least effected. TEST-yolk provided significantly more protection against a reduction in velocity compared with glycerol. A total of 18, 17, and 27 patients conceived using fresh, glycerol, or TEST-yolk-preserved semen, respectively. For these same groups, a cumulative pregnancy rate of 52.9%, 27.1%, and 68.5%, respectively, was observed (not significant). The total number of motile sperm per insemination used for fresh artificial inseminations resulting in conception (132.4 X 10(6] was significantly greater than the number used for successful glycerol- and TEST-yolk-preserved semen (approximately 24 X 10(6]. These results demonstrate that although the number of motile sperm of cryopreserved ejaculates are dramatically reduced compared with the fresh counterparts, if a minimum criteria for ejaculate quality is established, the use of cryopreserved semen can offer a viable, effective, and relatively safe alternative to artificial insemination by donor with fresh semen.\r"

At time (t) = 0, PFs increased both sperm parameters as compared with control (P less than 0.01).

No correlation was found between a particular infertile group and a definite negative effect. However, 70% of PFs from fertile women maintained or increased the proportion of motile sperm at t = 5 hours, compared with 36% in the total infertile group. Comparison of the sperm motility effect(s) of a given PF on different ejaculates revealed that the effects observed also were influenced by the sperm sample tested. In conclusion, PFs can maintain or increase the motility of spermatozoa as function of time. However, some PFs can inhibit sperm motility and these effect(s) can be influenced by the sperm sample.\r"

Under standardized and optimized conditions of abstinence and semen sample processing, we measured sperm acrosin activity in washed sperm from direct aliquots of semen and in aliquots of semen filtered through glasswool to remove dead cells and debris. Using washed sperm from semen, sperm acrosin levels in infertile men (median, 44 microIU/10(6) sperm) were significantly lower than values measured in fertile men (median, 67 microIU/10(6) sperm, P less than 0.01). After glasswool filtration, sperm acrosin activity was higher for both fertile and infertile men. Using washed sperm, 7 of 25 patients had acrosin activity consistently below values measured for fertile men; after glasswool filtration, values for 8 of 14 patients were below the normal range. For either fertile or infertile men, sperm acrosin activity showed no correlation with sperm density, percent motility, or either motion characteristic of curvilinear velocity (Vc40 microns/sec) or linearity (L3); and further, the low sperm acrosin activity of some infertile patients did not correlate with the motion co-characteristics measured at Vc40/L3, and the majority of patients with slower and/or less directional sperm had normal acrosin activity. From our data, we therefore conclude that sperm acrosin activity is independent of sperm motion characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "Elevated endometrial antibody titers were detected in serum and peritoneal fluid of rabbits with experimentally induced endometriosis. Surgical extirpation of implants or suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist resulted in decreased endometrial antibody titers, whereas the antibody titers in untreated rabbits with endometriosis increased significantly. Endometrial implants and normal endometrial tissue had similar proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the serum and peritoneal fluid from rabbits with experimentally induced endometriosis had gamma G immunoglobulin antibodies to an endometrial protein with molecular weight of approximately 40 kD. These antibodies were absent in rabbits without endometriosis. Isolation of endometrial antigens eliciting the humoral immune response in endometriosis may aid in the development of a specific antibody marker for endometriosis.\r"

  ".W": "The potential of photodynamic therapy for endometriosis was evaluated by autotransplantation of endometrial tissue in 15 female virgin New Zealand white rabbits. After maturation, 14 animals were injected intravenously with 10 mg/kg of dihematoporphyrin ether (DHE) and, 24 hours later, transplants were exposed to 630 nm light at 100 to 210 mW/cm2. Sixteen transplants received 100 J/cm2, 10 transplants received 50 J/cm2; 13 untreated transplants served as controls. In the remaining animal that did not receive DHE, 3 transplants were irradiated with 100 J/cm2. Six days after treatment, transplants were harvested with the underlying musculature, and multiple sections were examined histopathologically. Complete endometrial epithelial destruction was seen in 13 of 16 transplants (81%) in the 100 J/cm2 group and in 6 of 10 transplants (60%) in the 50-J/cm2 group. Nearly complete endometrial epithelial destruction was seen in 2 other transplants in each group. No damage occurred in either the 3 transplants that received 100 J/cm2 without prior DHE or in the 13 transplants with DHE and no irradiation. The sensitivity of ectopic rabbit endometrial tissue encourages further evaluation of photodynamic therapy for the treatment of human endometrial disorders.\r"

Fifty-one patients were randomly allocated to one of the above protocols. The mean number of blastomeres of embryos transferred at 68 to 72 hours after insemination was significantly (P less than 0.0001) higher than those transferred at 44 to 48 hours. The number of embryos with good morphology was similar in all study groups. The pregnancy rate was similar in the three protocol groups, 53% at 44 to 48 hours, 59% at 64 to 72 hours, and 47% by sequential transfer. There probably is no advantage in delaying the transfer or dividing the embryos into two sequential transfers. It seems that sequential transfer is not associated with any harmful effect.\r"

This effect has been attributed to the progestational activity of spironolactone observed in animal models. However, when oral spironolactone was given to women with appropriately estrogen-primed endometrium, secretory transformation of the endometrium was absent in comparison with control cycles. When control cycles were repeated with the addition of spironolactone, a decidualized endometrial response was seen. These findings suggest that spironolactone at clinically used dosages does not act as a progestin or an antiprogestin on the human endometrium.\r"

  ".W": "In a study on endometriosis, ten patients were treated with danazol (200 mg three times a day) and ten patients with high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (100 mg a day) for 6 months. The circulating high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration decreased significantly in the danazol (53%) and in the MPA groups (26%); the change in the danazol group was significantly higher than that in the MPA group. Danazol also significantly increased the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels (37%), whereas MPA had no significant effect. Danazol (29%) and MPA (12%) decreased the apolipoprotein A-1 levels significantly. The decrease caused by danazol was significantly greater. Danazol also significantly decreased the apolipoprotein A-2 levels (12%) and significantly increased the apolipoprotein B levels (17%), whereas MPA had no significant effects on them. Three months after the end of medication, all values were at the pretreatment levels. The circulating cholesterol, triglyceride, and very low-density lipoprotein concentrations remained unchanged during both treatments. Danazol and high-dose MPA induced a similar significant regression of peritoneal endometriotic implants in relation to placebo. Our present results, showing that danazol, to a greater extent than high-dose MPA, is associated with changes in lipoprotein metabolism that expose the individual to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, suggest that high-dose MPA is preferable to danazol in the long-term treatment of endometriosis.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the role of androgens in gonadotropin regulation in women, we studied the effects of a pure nonsteroidal antiandrogen, Anandron (Cassenne, Paris, France). Nine normally cycling women (group 1) with acne and/or seborrhoea and nine patients with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) (group 2) received Anandron (100 mg twice a day) and a placebo. Both treatments were administered orally, in a cross-over randomized design, for two consecutive cycles (group 1) or months (group 2) separated by one cycle or 1 month. Luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency and amplitude (cluster analysis), basal and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulated plasma LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were determined on day 5 of each treatment or placebo cycle. On days 5, 10, 20, and 24 of each cycle or month, plasma estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and urinary androstanediol glucuronide (3 alpha-diol G) were measured. Plasma progesterone (P) levels were determined on days 20 and 24 of each cycle (group 1) and on days 5, 10, 20, and 24 (group 2). In both groups, seborrhea and acne decreased markedly within the first month and practically disappeared after 2 months of Anandron treatment. No adverse side effects were reported. None of the normal patients had any disturbance of menstrual cycles as assessed by basal body temperature shift, ultrasonography, and plasma P levels. In PCOD patients, cycles remained anovulatory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During bromocriptine treatment, the serum prolactin (PRL) concentration significantly decreased, and consequently the serum estradiol (E2) concentration was significantly higher than in the controls on cycle day 9, and the ratio of testosterone (T) to E2 was decreased from cycle day 8 through day 10. The luteal phase progesterone concentration and the length of the luteal phase were not affected by bromocriptine therapy. The number and quality of oocytes harvested and the cleavage rates were similar in both groups. The present results, together with our previous observations, demonstrate that PRL participates in the regulation of ovarian steroidogenesis, particularly aromatization of T to E2.\r"

The method has appropriate sensitivity (12 nmol/l), better specificity than a conventional radioimmunoassay with polyclonal antibodies, and the advantages of speed, simplicity, less imprecision, and improved clinical effectiveness. The labeled antigen is a novel fluorescent europium chelate covalently linked to estrone glucuronide at carbon 6 of the glucuronide moiety. The antibodies were raised against estrone-3-glucuronyl-6-bovine serum albumin. The antibody binding reaction is performed in microtiter wells (or tubes) and involves the addition of labeled antigen in buffer (2 ng/100 microliters), a limited concentration of antibodies in buffer (100 microliters), and standard or urine sample (10 microliters). The mixture is incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Time-resolved fluorescence from the unbound label is proportional to the concentration of estrone glucuronide. The method may be used to monitor ovarian function and potential fertility in women.\r"
