  ".W": "The zona pellucida surrounding mouse oocytes is an extracellular matrix composed of three sulfated glycoproteins, ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3. It has been demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody to ZP3 injected into female mice inhibits fertilization by binding to the zona pellucida and blocking sperm penetration. A complementary DNA encoding ZP3 was randomly cleaved and 200- to 1000-base pair fragments were cloned into the expression vector lambda gt11. This epitope library was screened with the aforementioned contraceptive antibody, and the positive clones were used to map the seven-amino acid epitope recognized by the antibody. Female mice were immunized with a synthetic peptide containing this B cell epitope coupled to a carrier protein to provide helper T cell epitopes. The resultant circulating antibodies to ZP3 bound to the zona pellucida of immunized animals and produced long-lasting contraception. The lack of ovarian histopathology or cellular cytotoxicity among the immunized animals may be because of the absence of zona pellucida T cell epitopes in this vaccine.\r"

Despite this popularity, there are no universally accepted guidelines for its application. We report the case of a 6-month-old infant who had respiratory distress and seizures after TAC administration. In addition, we surveyed emergency departments within the state of Virginia regarding their guidelines for TAC application in children. Of the 91 hospitals surveyed, 32 (35%) currently administer TAC, and 14 (44%) of these have no guidelines regarding its use. Among the 20 (63%) with restrictions, there is wide variability in the way it is prescribed. TAC solution is a highly potent anesthetic agent with significant toxicity potential. Research into appropriate dosages, absorption, and actions needs to be undertaken before its widespread acceptance as the drug of choice for providing local anesthesia in children.\r"

Of these, five died and four were left with a substantial neurologic deficit as a result of injury. Of the 18 survivors, eight (44%) were removed from their home along with their siblings, one was placed in a sheltered environment with its mother, and nine (50%) were kept under surveillance. Six of the 12 patients with CT evidence of intracranial damage had no or minimal evidence of external cranial trauma. Although shaking as the major etiologic factor in neurologic impairment from child abuse has recently been questioned, our results implicate it as a common mechanism of injury. Every patient had a parent or guardian whose account of the mechanism of injury either changed from moment to moment or was inconsistent with the child's injury. Nine patients (39%) were known to have been seen previously by other physicians because of similar problems or other injuries consistent with child abuse. Early recognition of child abuse is paramount to saving not only the life of the affected child, but possibly the lives of siblings. Neurosurgeons should maintain a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of child abuse.\r"

We studied 23 patients treated for malignant gliomas; 16 were men and seven were women, with a mean age of 51 years (range, 26 to 78). Five patients had DVT shown by noninvasive blood flow studies, and four subsequently had PE, as demonstrated by ventilation perfusion lung scan; in one patient PE was diagnosed at autopsy. Of the 23 patients, four with postoperative craniotomy had DVT and all four had PE. Two of the five patients who received preoperative chemotherapy had DVT and three had PE. All patients with PE had a Greenfield filter placed in the inferior vena cava via the internal jugular vein without adverse sequelae.\r"

Mammary artery bypass versus saphenous vein bypass only approached significance (14% vs 3%, P = .11). Multivariate analysis showed obesity (P = .002), diabetes (P = .041), and prolonged postoperative ventilation (P = .005) to be important. We conclude that obese diabetic women are at extremely high risk for sternotomy dehiscence, and mammary artery bypass in this high-risk population may be a relative contraindication.\r"

The complication rate was 74% (11 cases), and included five cases of migration or malposition, two cases of perforation, and one case of obstruction. The recognition of postprocedural complications is paramount to their successful management.

The participants were typically health conscious, as evidenced by the low prevalence of current cigarette smoking (13%), but more than 21% of the men and 33% of the women over age 50 had cholesterol levels in excess of 240 mg/dl, placing them at moderate to high risk for coronary artery disease. Results revealed a pronounced dose response relationship between cigarette smoking and cholesterol in men of all age groups and in women of premenopausal age, whereas levels were similar in ex-smokers and those who had never smoked. Risk analysis revealed a strong positive association between cholesterol and the prevalence of nonfatal myocardial infarctions. Notably, patients with newly diagnosed hypercholesterolemia reduced their cholesterol an average of 36 mg/dl under care of physicians. These results indicate that cholesterol screening coupled with physician follow-up and treatment can have a substantial impact in lowering cholesterol and its attendant risk of cardiovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "The Kimray-Greenfield venal caval filter is widely accepted as a means of preventing pulmonary embolism when medical anticoagulation has failed or complications have developed. When indicated, anticoagulants are usually resumed after placement of the filter. A retrospective study was performed comparing the thromboembolic and postphlebitic complications in patients who continued to receive anticoagulants after placement of the filter versus those who did not. Sixty-eight Kimray-Greenfield filters were placed in 68 patients (43 men and 25 women) during a four year period. After placement of the filter, 26 patients received anticoagulants and 42 did not. Three of those receiving anticoagulants and six of those who did not had significant swelling of the leg; two of those receiving anticoagulants and two of those who did not had a recurrent deep venous thrombosis. There were no instances of recurrent pulmonary embolism. There were no significant differences in the results of these two groups of patients. These results are consistent with those reported in the literature in that no correlation has been found between the use of anticoagulants after placement of the filter and recurrent thromboembolism or stasis sequelae. In view of the complications associated with medical anticoagulation, we recommend its discontinuation in all patients after placement of the Kimray-Greenfield filter.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of varicocele in a female patient is difficult clinically. Until recently, only celioscopy and uterine phlebography were helpful. We have developed a new method for diagnosis of the pelvic varicocele using retrograde phlebography of the ovarian and iliac veins. Thirty-three women with pelvic pains and disorders of the menstrual cycle have been studied. In 15 patients, an insufficiency of the left ovarian vein was revealed. In three of the patients, an analogous insufficiency of the right ovarian vein was also recognized, along with chronic bilateral stasis in the pampiniform plexes. An insufficiency of the left iliac vein was present in seven of the patients without ovarian varicocele. The average age of the women without ovarian reflux was lower (22.5 years) than that of women with reflux (36.6 years) (p less than 0.01). In this last group of patients, the number of pregnancies was greater (30 children) than in the group without reflux (two children) (chi-square = 12.75; p less than 0.001). This indicates how parity plays an important role in the determination of the appearance of a varicocele. We conclude that the diagnosis of pelvic varicocele may be made by a new diagnostic method represented by retrograde phlebography of the ovarian and iliac veins. The use of it in patients with chronic pelvic pains and disorders of the menstrual cycle of unknown nature can be done routinely.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and seventy-nine patients with 237 hernias of the groin who were at high risk for recurrence after classic hernioplasty were operated upon; the procedure of giant prosthetic reinforcement of the visceral sac (GPRVS) was used. The patients in this series had predominantly recurrent and re-recurrent hernias. However, a few were obese with bilateral primary direct hernias and some had associated connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. GPRVS eliminates hernias of the groin by rendering the peritoneum inextensible by placing, in the preperitoneal space, a large prosthesis that extends far beyond the borders of the myopectineal orifice. The myopectineal orifice is the weak spot at which all hernias of the groin begin and is bounded by the rectus, oblique abdominal and iliopsoas muscles and the pectin of the pubis. In bilateral GPRVS, the peritoneum of both groins is reinforced with a single prosthesis inserted in the preperitoneal space through the midline. In unilateral GPRVS, the mesh envelops the peritoneum of a single groin. This simplifies the operation and makes it suitable for surgical centers that perform outpatient operations. The prosthesis with the best physical characteristics for GPRVS is Mersilene (polyester fiber). Unsutured prostheses of polypropylene and Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) may not adhere at the far edges, leading to a failure and recurrence. The over-all recurrence rate in this series of problem hernias was 3.7 per cent, which is extremely good. However, the rate becomes outstanding if recurrences resulting from meshes unsuitable for GPRVS are excluded.\r"

  ".W": "Coverage of large defects of the soft tissue of the groin present a challenging problem. Exposure of the femoral vessels or prosthetic grafts requires urgent coverage with well vascularized tissue. The medial and lateral femoral circumflex arteries supply the gracilis, sartorius, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris and tensor fascia lata muscles, permitting the use of these muscles or myocutaneous flaps for coverage of groin defects when the femoral artery is intact. With extensive wounds of the groin resulting from trauma, ablation of carcinoma and vascular reconstruction for atherosclerosis involving the femoral vessels, the aforementioned flaps cannot be used. The external iliac artery supplies the rectus abdominis muscle through the deep inferior epigastric artery and the interal oblique muscle through the deep circumflex iliac artery. These muscle flaps are available when the femoral vessels are not intact. If the ipsilateral iliofemoral vessels are not intact, branches of the contralateral iliac artery through deep inferior epigastric artery and deep circumflex iliac artery provide suitable flaps for covering the groin wound. We review our experience with the management of difficult groin wounds (n = 31) and present a systematic approach to reconstruction of the groin based on these anatomic facts.\r"

Of 1,708 patients who underwent surgical treatment with positive blood cultures, 23 (1.3 per cent) with clostridial bacteremia were identified. Twenty-one of the 23 patients manifested clinical signs of sepsis at the time of clostridial bacteremia consisting of fever, leukocytosis or hypotension. Fourteen patients had intra-abdominal sources of bacteremia and eight of these had either a diverticular abscess or colorectal perforation. The over-all mortality rate was 43 per cent, with all deaths resulting from uncontrolled sepsis. An association between clostridial bacteremias and malignant disease has been described. Thirteen malignant diseases were identified in 12 of the 23 patients reported herein. Carcinoma of the colon and rectum was the most frequently associated malignant condition, but a wide variety of other malignant diseases were also identified. The diagnosis of underlying malignant disease was known prior to the clostridial bacteremia in ten patients and unknown in two. None of the patients were receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy at the time of bacteremia. Three different Clostridium species were isolated in patients with underlying malignant disease, supporting an association between malignant conditions and other Clostridium species as well as Clostridium septicum. The identification of clostridial bacteremia in surgical patients warrants both aggressive treatment of the septic state and a thorough search for associated malignant lesions.\r"

  ".U": "90049636\r", 
  ".W": "Differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid gland is regarded as an indolent disease. However, this notion is dispelled when the population is stratified according to age, gross and microscopic tumoral characteristics and according to the occurrence of local and distant metastases in the early postoperative period. The adverse effect of local and distant recurrences on survival time has been emphasized in multiple series from the United States and Europe. However, the critical question that has yet to be answered is whether or not inadequately treated differentiated carcinomas of the thyroid gland seemingly cured in younger patients will recur as aggressive, malignant tumors when the same patients reach the graying golden years. A provisional answer to this question may indeed be found in the incidence of early postoperative nodal and distant recurrence rates. Some authors have concluded that the extent of operative treatment does not have a major influence on the course of differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid gland. This conclusion prompted the present follow-up study of 250 patients with differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid gland to examine the clinical course and results of therapy. We report a cumulative mortality rate of 2.4 per cent and a recurrence rate of 1.6 per cent, consisting of a 1.2 per cent incidence of cervical nodal recurrence and a distant recurrence rate of 0.4 per cent (one patient), after a median follow-up period of seven years and a mean of six years. Since there were no differences in treatment and outcome in 191 patients we studied who had papillary and 59 who had follicular carcinoma, they were analyzed as a single group for this report. Total thyroidectomy was the minimal treatment of all operable patients. In addition, 21.0 per cent required a modified dissection of the neck and 8.4 per cent of the patients had postoperative radioactive iodine administered to ablate either remnants of normal tissue or previously undetected metastases to cervical nodes or lungs. Potential factors contributing to improved local and distant recurrence rates included early detection of disease, especially in children who had irradiation and who were recalled and screened (34 per cent in this series); the use of needle aspiration cytologic study, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment; total thyroidectomy, and the effective use of radioactive iodine administered as a single large dose within the first six months after thyroidectomy.\r"

Twelve dogs underwent lithotripsy 14 days after implantation of a 9 to 14 millimeter human stone in the gallbladder. The dogs were sacrificed one, 14 and 28 days after lithotripsy (four dogs at each date). Two dogs underwent implantation of stone but not lithotripsy and were sacrificed 14 days later. The last four dogs received only shock wave therapy and were sacrificed one (two dogs) and 14 (two dogs) days later. All calculi were completely fragmented into pieces less than 5 millimeters. Increases in leukocyte count (11 +/- 3.7 10(9) per liter) and alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels (206 +/- 139 and 156 +/- 164 international units per deciliter, respectively) were seen after lithotripsy (p less than 0.05), but returned to normal during the next four weeks. Macroscopic hemorrhages were noted only in the dogs having undergone lithotripsy and were exclusively located in the organs lying in the path of the shock wave. Macroscopic hemorrhages were found in all six dogs sacrificed the day after lithotripsy and in two of the six dogs sacrificed 14 days later; one dog of the four sacrificed 28 days after lithotripsy still showed a large hemorrhage in the wall of the gallbladder. Microscopic abnormalities included congestion and hemorrhage of the same organs; although more discrete, congestion and hemorrhage were still present one month after shock wave therapy. Early and localized pulmonary fibrosis at the hypercellular stage was noted in two of the four dogs sacrificed at 28 days. The clinical implications for biliary lithotripsy upon humans include the necessity for intact coagulation parameters, strict avoidance of the bases of the lungs in targeting the stone and performing an ultrasonographic assessment of the wall of the gallbladder before repeating lithotripsy sessions, month apart.\r"

Prompt diagnosis of the syndrome and early total thyroidectomy offer the only chance for cure. Surgical guidelines for managing the pediatric patient with potential for MCT have included screening with provocative calcitonin tests beginning at one year of age and total thyroidectomy performed when either basal calcitonin or stimulated test levels become abnormal. The diagnosis of MEN IIb, however, can be made on the basis of pathognomic clinical features, including characteristic facies, marfanoid body habitus, submucosal ganglioneuromas and thickened corneal nerves. A family is described herein in which one member had the pathognomonic clinical findings of MEN IIb but did not have an elevated level of serum calcitonin in response to stimulation with pentagastrin and calcium. Nonetheless, a total thyroidectomy was performed and multiple microscopic foci of MCT were found on pathologic examination. This suggests that total thyroidectomy should be performed upon any patient with the characteristic phenotype of MEN IIb, regardless of the results of the stimulation test for calcitonin.\r"

PGV was performed for duodenal ulcer (n = 293), midgastric ulcer (n = 14), prepyloric or pyloric ulcer (n = 46) and combined gastric, pyloric, prepyloric and duodenal ulcers (n = 43). Postoperative follow-up observation ranged from five to 13 years (a mean of eight years) and was complete in 96 per cent of the patients. There was no perioperative mortality. Severe dumping and diarrhea were uncommon (less than 1 per cent), and only eight patients (2 per cent) had reoperations for nonulcerative complications. Documented recurrent ulcer appeared in 55 patients (14 per cent). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probabilities of recurrence at five and ten years after PGV, respectively, were duodenal ulcer, 6 and 12 per cent; gastric ulcer, 16 and 16 per cent; pyloric or prepyloric ulcer, 12 and 39 per cent, and combined ulcers, 26 and 33 per cent. Reoperation for recurrence was required in only 16 of the 55 patients (29 per cent). We conclude that PGV for peptic ulcer is a safe operation with few serious side effects. When used to treat duodenal and perhaps midgastric ulcers, PGV has an acceptable long term recurrence rate. The high incidence of recurrent ulcer after PGV for pyloric or prepyloric or combined ulcers suggests that alternative operations should be performed for ulcers in these locations.\r"

This entailed initial hepatic decompression by suprahepatic, mesoatrial shunt, with subsequent takedown of the mesoatrial shunt combined with conversion to a short infrahepatic, portacaval shunt. We report herein the late follow-up results for two patients managed in this manner. While both patients are alive and doing well, both of the courses have been complicated by stenosis of the inferior vena cava. The cause is unclear but probably relates to fibrosis at the hepatic venous orifices. Management was by percutaneous balloon dilation, which relieved the recurrent hepatic congestion. This cautions others considering this approach to provide careful longitudinal follow-up study for such patients.\r"

The second group (Class III), which includes glands with nodular hyperplasia, abnormal cytologic findings or oxyphilic nodules, is considered clinically significant. Evaluation and follow-up study revealed three instances of clinical hyperparathyroidism attributed to Class III histologic changes, while there were no instances of recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism attributable to Class II disease. Involvement of multiple glands, both gross and microscopic, occurred frequently (26 per cent) and was often bilateral and nonuniform. We concluded that optimal surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism is achieved by selective removal of parathyroid glands guided by the histologic findings in each gland.\r"

Sixty-eight patients (38 per cent) had urologic manifestations categorized as ureteral obstruction or injury (34 per cent), invasion to the bladder or prostate, or both (10 per cent), isolated gross hematuria (18 per cent), radiation cystitis (6 per cent) and neurogenic bladder (26 per cent). Involvement of the genitourinary tract was more common among patients with recurrent versus primary carcinoma (53 versus 32 per cent) and among patients with high stage (Dukes' C and D) versus low stage (Dukes' A and B) carcinoma (48 versus 21 per cent). The survival rate was worse in patients with high stage compared with low stage disease and no patient with recurrent high stage disease survived beyond three years. Short term survival (less than two years) was not statistically different among patients with or without manifestations in the genitourinary tract: 63 and 45 versus 71 and 66 per cent at one and two years, respectively; however, the five year survival rate was worse among patients with genitourinary involvement (30 versus 54 per cent, p less than 0.05). Surgical and endoscopic intervention of the urinary tract was performed upon 36 patients with Dukes' C and D carcinoma because of life-threatening sepsis or azotemia, or both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, comparisons were made between ratings by residents of their peers (n = 32) and of attending surgeons (n = 61) with whom they had worked. The ratings consisted of scores from 1 to 5 in each of ten areas of clinical competence. Results indicated that over-all ratings by peers and supervisors were highly intercorrelated (r = 0.92; p less than 0.001) and that the average of over-all ratings by peers and supervisors correlated moderately with the total raw score on ABSITE (r = 0.58; p less than 0.01). Factor analyses suggested that the dimensions underlying the three sets of ratings differed considerably. It appeared that ratings by supervisors were influenced primarily by the interpersonal skills of the residents and secondarily by ability. In contrast, self-ratings by the residents were apparently mainly influenced by their perceptions of their own ability, followed by interpersonal skills and effort. Ratings by peers, on the other hand, seemed to reflect the over-all impression of the peers of the resident being rated. Comparisons between ratings of peers and attending surgeons by residents revealed that residents view attending surgeons as having a more balanced level of competence, across areas of both ability and interpersonal skills. Ratings of peers were lower than were the ratings of attending physicians by the residents in the areas of technical ability, knowledge of basic science and clinical knowledge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During the two years from 1 November 1985 to 31 October 1987, 177 patients were admitted to a hospital in Oxford with the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The aneurysm had ruptured in 88 patients, of whom 75 underwent emergent surgical treatment, yielding an operative mortality rate of 36 per cent. Of the 13 patients who did not have surgical treatment, two died before transfer to the operating room; in the other 11 patients, a deliberate decision was made not to undertake surgical treatment--in ten patients, the reason was an age of 85 years or more and in one patient, severe debilitating Parkinson's disease. Emergent operations were done upon another 15 patients--11 who had acute aneurysm and four in whom symptoms were not caused by an aneurysm. Emergent operations for ruptured or acute aneurysms represented 55 per cent of all operations for AAA. This high proportion and large number of emergent operations is in marked contrast with the experience of comparable specialist vascular surgical units in the United States. The 24-fold difference in mortality rates between surgical procedures performed electively and for ruptured aneurysm suggests that a considerable impact on over-all mortality could be achieved by a substantial increase in referral of patients\r"

The most frequent complications of MD were obstruction and diverticulitis. Analysis of records of patients revealed that MD is a rare intraoperative finding. The calculated incidence was 2.4 per cent, and the ratio of diverticulectomy to appendectomy was 1:55. A preoperative diagnosis of MD was rare (4 per cent). Only in those patients with hemorrhage were diagnostic procedures (angiography, scintigraphy and roentgenography) useful. Ectopic tissues occurred in 23 per cent of all patients and were observed more often in patients with complications of MD. There was a correlation between hemorrhage and gastric heterotopic tissue. Another correlation was found between invagination and pancreatic tissue as well as diverticulitis. Postoperative adhesions causing ileus was the main complication found after resection for MD (8 per cent), whereas no other severe complications were observed (no insufficiency). There was no death as a result of resection. Because of the low rate of postoperative complications and the latent risk of complications arising sometime during life in sporadic episodes, a prophylactic resection is indicated but is often performed too late because the primary endangered group for complications is children who are less than two years of age. Predominantly in those with hemorrhage, the base of the diverticulum should be carefully checked for heterotopic tissue to prevent further complications.\r"

Under hypocapnic conditions, mean intracranial pressure increased by less than 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) late in the inhalation period only in patients whose baseline intracranial pressure was less than 20 mm Hg. It was concluded that under hypocapnic conditions, the magnitude of this increase in intracranial pressure does not prohibit the safe evaluation of cerebral blood flow in victims of head injury using xenon-enhanced computed tomography.\r"

Thirty normal limbs, 110 limbs with primary varicose veins, 34 limbs with reflux in the deep veins but without occlusion, and 31 limbs with deep venous occlusion, with or without reflux, have been studied. An increase in the incidence of ulceration occurred with increasing values of reflux and decreasing values of the calf muscle pump ejection fraction. A poor ejection fraction was the primary cause of venous ulceration in limbs with minimal reflux. A good ejection fraction, however, significantly reduced the incidence of ulceration in limbs with marked reflux (p less than 0.05). The residual volume fraction, which expresses the combined effect of venous reflux and ejection fraction with rhythmic exercise, showed a good correlation with the incidence of ulceration and the measurements of ambulatory venous pressure (r = 0.81). The air-plethysmographic measurements completely assess the calf muscle pump function and provide an accurate method to identify the predominant hemodynamic factor (ejection fraction, reflux, or both) responsible for the clinical picture of the patient.\r"

  ".W": "Increased susceptibility to infection in patients with obstructive jaundice has been well documented in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, an underlying mechanism for immunocompromise in these patients has not been identified. This study was undertaken to evaluate the production of two important immunoregulatory molecules, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in cancer patients with obstructive jaundice before and after percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD). After decompression with PTBD, IL-1 and IL-2 production was significantly increased (IL-1: from 7.9 +/- 4.9 to 13.9 +/- 4.9 U/ml, p less than 0.05; IL-2: from 8.8 +/- 4.9 to 14.1 +/- 6.5 U/ml, p less than 0.05). There was a positive correlation between IL-1 and IL-2 production (r = 0.424, p less than 0.05). The production of both interleukins correlated negatively with serum total bilirubin level (IL-1 r = -0.478, p less than 0.05; IL-2: r = -0.482, p less than 0.05) and positively with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in serum (IL-1: r = 0.505, p less than 0.01; IL-2: r = 0.494, p less than 0.05). IL-2 production also correlated positively with serum albumin levels (r = 0.511, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that hyperbilirubinemia and abnormal lipid metabolism may be associated with impaired interleukin production, which may result in an increased susceptibility to infection during obstructive jaundice.\r"

One permanent, disabling brachial plexus injury occurred after this operation. Transthoracic first rib resection (18 cases), presently our preferred technique, resulted in improvement in 87% of cases, with 13% of symptoms unchanged after 1 year. Although two female patients felt mild paresthesia of the mammary gland, no one has been made worse following this route. These two approaches have achieved similar results in the surgical management of this syndrome. Nevertheless, when first rib resection is indicated, our favored and recommended procedure is transthoracic, because this route appears less hazardous for brachial plexus damage.\r"

In six dogs that underwent vagotomy and Roux gastrectomy and in four dogs that underwent vagotomy and Billroth gastrectomy (controls), myoelectric activity of the Roux limb or duodenum was measured during gastric emptying of a 500 kcal mixed meal of 99mTc-labeled cooked egg and 111In-labeled milk. Roux dogs were tested with and without pacing of the Roux limb. Roux dogs showed ectopic pacemaker in the Roux limb that drove the pacesetter potentials of the limb in a reverse, or orad, direction during 57% of the postprandial recordings. Billroth dogs had no ectopic pacemakers (p less than 0.05). Liquids emptied more slowly in Roux dogs (half-life (t1/2) = 121 +/- 15 minutes) than in Billroth dogs (t1/2 = 43 +/- 9 minutes; p less than 0.05), but solids emptied similarly in both groups of dogs (t1/2 approximately 8 hours). Pacing the Roux limb abolished the ectopic pacemakers, restored the slow emptying of liquids to the more rapid rate found in the Billroth dogs (t1/2: paced Roux, 72 +/- 15 minutes; Billroth, 43 +/- 9 minutes; p greater than 0.05) and did not change emptying of solids. The conclusion was that ectopic pacemakers present in the Roux limb after vagotomy and Roux gastrectomy drove the limb in a reverse direction and slowed emptying of liquids after the operation. The defect was corrected by pacing the Roux limb in a forward direction.\r"

However, hydrocortisone, 10 and 20 mg/kg, produced comparable elevation in bile flow with no effect on SO and gallbladder motility. The effect of cholic acid on SO motility was not influenced by prior treatment with atropine. Phentolamine or propranolol administration did not influence SO wave frequency SO wave frequency, but subsequent injection of cholic acid resulted in a decrease in SO wave frequency. Gallbladder pressure was not influenced by atropine, phentolamine, or propranolol, and these agents did not influence the cholic acid-induced fall in gallbladder pressure. These findings suggest that bile acids influence the motility of the biliary tract.\r"

  ".W": "In model experiments with mongrel dogs, intestinal strangulation obstruction was induced by occluding the superior mesenteric veins, and a rise in the inorganic phosphate value of the blood was observed. The high inorganic phosphate values of the fluid exuding from the strangulated bowel suggest that intestinal factors associated with the strangulated bowel may be partly responsible for this elevated phosphatemia. However, hyperphosphatemia was also found in a model experiment in which the route through which the fluid was absorbed into the blood from the peritoneal cavity was interrupted by keeping the strangulated bowel in an intestinal bag. After this, in the model experiments in which a systemic blood pressure depression curve with a percentage reduction similar to that of the decreasing arterial blood pressure resulting from strangulation was produced (by exsanguination, and even by exsanguination with adequate perfusion of the gut), plasma inorganic phosphate values also increased. Therefore it is undeniable that systemic factors other than the above-mentioned local factors are related to the rise in plasma inorganic phosphate values in experimental strangulation obstruction. Because it is not possible to assert that phosphatemia is specific to intestinal strangulation, the importance of a rise in inorganic phosphate values in the early diagnosis of intestinal strangulation cannot be considered very great.\r"

The average annual hazard rate for contralateral carcinomas was 8/1000 patients at risk per year without significant fluctuations throughout the 20 years of follow-up. Recurrences were caused by 9 of 57 (16%) subsequent contralateral carcinomas, and 4 of the 57 patients (7%) died of recurrent contralateral carcinomas. Contralateral carcinomas were responsible for 5.1% (9 of 176) of all recurrences of breast carcinomas and 2.6% (4 of 153) of breast carcinoma deaths. Surveillance of the contralateral breast must continue throughout a patient's lifetime. Detection and treatment of subsequent lesions at an early stage is a beneficial result of follow-up, especially in women whose first carcinoma is likely to have been cured.\r"

There was a significant (p = 0.001) inverse association between serum cholesterol and the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage but not of subarachnoid hemorrhage. This inverse association was nonlinear, with a higher incidence rate only for men with serum cholesterol in the lowest quintile (less than 189 mg/dl). The relative risk (lowest quintile/other four quintiles) was 2.55 (95% confidence interval 1.58-4.12) after controlling for age, blood pressure, serum uric acid, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. There was no evidence for an interaction between blood pressure and serum cholesterol, although the inverse association was stronger for normotensive than for hypertensive men. Public health implications would differ in different countries depending on the relative frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage and on the distribution of serum cholesterol levels in the population.\r"

Calcium deposits observed in the external, internal, and common carotid arteries were oriented in space and individually scored. We found calcified deposits in 39 patients. Stepwise multiple regression of the data provided evidence strongly suggesting a correlation between advancing age and calcium scores. Calcium was more heavily concentrated in the posterior half of arteries (p less than 0.01), in particular of the internal and common carotid arteries, and always in relation to an atheromatous plaque, suggesting a causative link to hemodynamic forces within the arteries. There was no difference in calcification scores between symptomatic and asymptomatic sides, indicating that calcium deposits do not contribute to the development of symptoms.\r"

Severe atherosclerotic stenosis was frequent but was not a prerequisite for thrombus formation since specimens from almost one half of the patients had only moderate narrowing of the lumen (less than 60% stenosis). Specimens from three patients showed ulcerations, those from one showed intraplaque hemorrhage, and those from one massive plaque rupture, all of which were thought to be important in thrombogenesis. All such types of plaque complications may thus precipitate thrombi but no single complication was particularly predominant, and specimens from one half of the patients showed no complications at all. Screening of the carotid arteries for stenosis can therefore detect only one half of the individuals who ultimately will develop thrombosis, and the risk caused by plaque complications seems to be moderate in unselected materials.\r"

A network of vasa vasorum surrounding atherosclerotic plaque was observed in five luminal casts and in two cleared specimens; the vasa vasorum originated from the superior thyroid and ascending pharyngeal arteries. Three of the five luminal casts also demonstrated vasa vasorum arising directly from the internal carotid artery distal to the plaque. An extensive network of vasa vasorum was not observed in specimens from the five cadavers relatively free of gross atherosclerotic plaque. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the external carotid artery in giving rise to the vasa vasorum that supply the areas of atherosclerotic plaque.\r"

We evaluated the extent of white matter lesions and the degree of atrophy of specific anatomic structures, such as the corpus callosum, using magnetic resonance imaging and quantified the volumes of the ventricles, the subarachnoid spaces, and the brain parenchyma using digitized brain computed tomography. Our results show that both borderline and demented patients had significantly more extensive white matter lesions than nondemented patients, indicating a significant relation between the extent of white matter lesions and intellectual decline. In addition, borderline and demented patients had significantly larger ventricles and more brain atrophy than nondemented patients; demented patients also had significantly larger subarachnoid spaces than nondemented patients and more brain atrophy than borderline patients. Our findings suggest that in most patients with lacunar stroke, periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions with subsequent white matter atrophy first induce ventricular enlargement, followed by generalized brain atrophy, resulting in dementia.\r"

The risk of further stroke and of further stroke and/or death was greater in patients with minor ischemic stroke although the difference was significant only for the latter. The apparent differences in prognosis could largely be accounted for by the favorable prognosis of patients with amaurosis fugax among those with transient ischemic attack. Although for some purposes it may be useful to distinguish transient ischemic attacks from minor ischemic strokes, the similarity of the two groups suggests that in many situations, including in clinical trials of treatments for the secondary prevention of strokes, the arbitrary distinction between them could be dispensed with.\r"

Compared with the controls, the patients showed decreased hemoglobin concentration and decreased total arterial oxygen content due to postoperative hemodilution. Global reductions in the metabolic rate for oxygen and in the tissue oxygen supply were noted even in the apparently normal cortex of the patients in spite of adequate blood flow and adequate oxygen extraction fraction. In addition, regional reductions in blood flow and in perfusion reserve were seen in the cortical territory corresponding to cerebral vasospasm. Our results indicate that two processes are involved in the pathophysiology of cerebral vasospasm: 1) generalized impairment of oxygen metabolism with a reduced tissue oxygen supply, even in the apparently normal cortex, and 2) additional impairment of regional perfusion in the territory of vasospasm.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively studied 244 consecutive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who were admitted within 72 hours to the same institution between November 1977 and May 1987 and who were not treated with antifibrinolytics. From November 1977 through December 1982 (the first study period), daily fluid intake was 1.5-2.1 and fluid restriction was applied when hyponatremia developed; antihypertensives were administered to all patients with high blood pressure. From January 1983 through April 1987 (the second study period), daily fluid intake was at least 3 l, fluid restriction was not applied, and antihypertensives were administered only when patients were receiving this treatment before admission; calcium antagonists were not administered. Entry variables of the patients admitted during the two study periods were not significantly different, although patients admitted during the second study period were at slightly increased risks of developing cerebral ischemia and of having a poor outcome. Despite this, cerebral ischemia occurred less frequently among patients admitted during the second study period than among those admitted during the first (16 [10%] of 155 patients vs. 19 [21%] of 89 patients; p  = 0.030). Overall mortality decreased from 46% to 36% while mortality among patients with cerebral ischemia decreased from 60% to 31% (difference not significant). Rebleeding and acute hydrocephalus occurred with the same frequency among patients admitted during both study periods. We conclude that the combination of increased fluid intake and the avoidance of antihypertensives helps prevent cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

  ".U": "90050371\r", 
  ".W": "We studied histopathologic changes in cerebral cortex of 20 rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion by using the Fink-Heimer suppressive silver impregnation method and conventional stains. At 6 hours after occlusion, Fink-Heimer-stained sections revealed abundant coarsely granular, intensely argyrophilic neurons in the ischemic cortex. These distinctive argyrophilic neurons could be clearly differentiated from neurons that suffered postmortem changes; argyrophilic neurons were present in all layers of the lateral parietal cortex but in only the superficial cortical layers II and III in the parasagittal area of the frontoparietal cortex and the temporo-occipital area. At 24 hours after occlusion as the ischemic region progressed to pannecrosis, argyrophilic neurons were still evident in peri-infarct regions, with more prominent neuritic silver deposits but no changes in number or spatial distribution. Over 2-7 days, the argyrophilic neurons gradually disappeared while many fine silver-impregnated degenerating terminals appeared in the peri-infarct regions. At 3-6 weeks after occlusion, no more argyrophilic neurons were seen in the cortex although degenerating axons were still present in the deep white matter. Our results indicate selective neuronal damage in the superficial cortical layers and massive axonal degeneration in the cerebrum surrounding infarcts. The neuronal damage does not appear to progress beyond 6 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. The Fink-Heimer method has many advantages over existing conventional stains for documenting selective neuronal damage in focal cerebral ischemia.\r"

Tissue uptake of [14C]iodoantipyrine was used to indicate regional cerebral blood flow, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure acetylcholine and choline concentrations. Cerebral cortical ischemia was induced by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, and variables were measured 2.5 or 24 hours later. A close correlation was found between tissue choline concentration and the reciprocal of regional cerebral blood flow. A large increase in tissue choline concentration was observed in the ischemic cortex. Choline production rate was estimated by plotting choline concentration against the reciprocal of regional cerebral blood flow. This rate was independent of choline concentration. Acetylcholine concentration, on the other hand, was constant in ischemic and normally perfused regions, except in the center of the ischemic region 2.5 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, where a significant decrease was observed.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the mechanism of its effect on ischemic stroke, we investigated the effect of nimodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on changes in cytosolic free calcium, cortical blood flow, and histologic changes following focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in 14 cats. Using indo-1, a fluorescent intracellular Ca2+ indicator, we simultaneously measured changes in the Ca2+ signal ratio (400:506 nm), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide fluorescence (464 nm), and reflectance (340 nm) during an ultraviolet excitation (340 nm) directly from the cat cortex in vivo. In six cats treated with vehicle only, the calcium signal ratio increased from 5 minutes after middle cerebral artery occlusion to 30 minutes into reperfusion. The elevation of cytosolic free calcium was significantly attenuated by nimodipine, which was administered by intravenous infusion in eight cats starting 5 minutes after occlusion. Nimodipine had no effect on cortical blood flow during ischemia but induced a hyperperfused state following reperfusion. Nimodipine did not modify changes in the mitochondrial oxidation-reduction state. Nimodipine proved to have beneficial effects on recovery of the electroencephalogram following reperfusion as well as on the extent of focal histologic damage. Our results suggest that nimodipine, when administered during the early stage of focal ischemia, can favorably modify the outcome of stroke by reducing the Ca2+ entry during both the ischemic and reperfusion periods.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the influence of phenylephrine-induced hypertension on the area of ischemia during brief middle cerebral artery occlusion. Rats were anesthetized with 1.2 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) isoflurane, and the middle cerebral artery was occluded via a subtemporal craniectomy. Immediately thereafter, in one group (n = 9) arterial blood pressure was increased 30-35 mm Hg above the preocclusion level by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine. In a second, control, group (n = 10) there was no manipulation of blood pressure. Local cerebral blood flow was determined autoradiographically 15 minutes after occlusion. The areas (expressed as a percentage of the total coronal cross-sectional area) in which local cerebral blood flow decreased to three ranges (0-6 ml/100 g/min [rapid neuronal death probable], 6-15 ml/100 g/min [delayed neuronal death probable], and 15-23 ml/100 g/min [electrophysiologic dysfunction with prolonged survival probable]) were measured. The areas in which local cerebral blood flow decreased to the two more severely ischemic ranges were smaller in the phenylephrine group than in the control group. For example, in the coronal section in the center of the middle cerebral artery distribution, local cerebral blood flow was 0-6 ml/100 g/min in 6.7 +/- 1.4% of the section in normotensive rats but was in that range in only 1.7 +/- 0.6% of the section during phenylephrine-induced hypertension (p less than 0.05). For the 6-15 ml/100 g/min range, the areas were 6.8 +/- 0.8% and 3.8 +/- 0.7%, respectively (p less than 0.05). For the 15-23 ml/100 g/min range, there were no differences between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We looked at FiO2, choice of anesthetic, nutritional status, and body temperature in a gerbil model of forebrain ischemia to determine their effect on data interpretation, ischemic outcome, and extent of pharmacologic protection. We subjected 484 gerbils to 5 minutes of forebrain ischemia under different experimental conditions. The gerbils were anesthetized with 3% halothane and inspired 21% O2, 37% O2 and 60% N2O, or 97% O2. Six groups of gerbils pretreated with 200 mg/kg phenytoin or 2 ml/kg polyethylene glycol (vehicle) underwent ischemia in the fasted or fed state. Three groups of gerbils receiving no pretreatment underwent ischemia with rectal temperatures of 32-33 degrees C, 34-35 degrees C, or 37 degrees C. We counted intact neurons in the CA1 hippocampal sector in brains fixed on Day 7 after ischemia. t tests of square-root-transformed cell counts were used to assess the effect of hypothermia, and analysis of variance of the transformed data was used to test for the effects of phenytoin, FiO2, and nutritional status. Phenytoin pretreatment provided significant protection from CA1 neuron loss in all groups tested (p less than 0.001), but the degree of protection varied from 20% to 44%. In spite of significantly higher serum glucose concentrations in fed than in fasted gerbils (173 and 118 mg/dl, respectively), we found no significant effect of nutritional status upon neuron loss in phenytoin- or vehicle-pretreated gerbils. An FiO2 of 21% significantly decreased the number of viable neurons in both vehicle- and phenytoin-pretreated groups (p less than 0.03), despite the lack of an effect of hypoxemia on arterial blood gases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of MCI-186 (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one), a novel free radical scavenger and an inhibitor of ischemia-induced brain edema, on monoamine metabolism in the brains of both normal and ischemic rats. In normal rats, 3 mg/kg i.v. MCI-186, a dose that prevents ischemic brain edema, had no significant effect on brain concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or their metabolites. After the injection of 5 microliters of 3% polyvinyl acetate into the left internal carotid artery, concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid markedly increased, but that of norepinephrine decreased, in the left telencephalon of embolized rats compared with control rats injected with vehicle; the concentration of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid also increased slightly. These effects were maximal 2 hours after embolization. The turnover rate of dopamine between 6 and 8 hours after embolization was significantly higher but that of norepinephrine was slightly lower than that in vehicle-treated rats. When rats were treated with 3 mg/kg i.v. MCI-186 immediately after the injection of polyvinyl acetate, the embolization-induced changes in monoamine metabolism were less marked. Our results suggest that MCI-186 attenuates ischemia-induced changes in brain monoamine metabolism, probably due to its free radical scavenging action, although it has no marked effect in normal rats.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral ischemia is known to be accompanied by brain edema. This increase in brain tissue water content probably influences the final outcome of an ischemic insult negatively. Despite extensive investigations on different aspects of brain edema, information on edema development during the early recirculation period following ischemia is sparse. We assessed changes in brain water content, as reflected by changes in tissue density, during the early recirculation period following severe forebrain ischemia. Fasted rats were subjected to 5, 15, or 30 minutes of ischemia and 5 to 180 minutes of recirculation. The specific gravity of specimens from the caudoputamen, frontoparietal cortex, hippocampus, and mesencephalon were measured with a Percoll linear density gradient. Five minutes of ischemia followed by recirculation did not produce any significant regional brain edema. However, following 15 minutes of ischemia, transient edema developed in the caudoputamen, frontoparietal cortex, and hippocampus. This edema was maximal after 30 minutes of reperfusion and was normalized after 180 minutes of reperfusion. Similar edema was seen following 30 minutes of ischemia. In the mesencephalon (where blood flow is approximately 50% of control during the ischemic insult) no brain edema was noted following 5, 15, or 30 minutes of ischemia. We discuss to what extent this transient regional brain edema may influence the selective neuronal vulnerability and cell damage observed in rats subjected to reversible forebrain ischemia and how these findings may correlate with neurochemical alterations observed during the early recirculation period.\r"

Serial sections of whole-mount specimens of the prostate removal at radical prostatectomy or autopsy are the gold standard by which any other method of pathologic correlation should be measured. More limited techniques of pathologic correlations, such as biopsy specimens, resulted in some confusion in the literature, particularly in reference to transrectal ultrasound. New techniques of immunohistochemistry, image analysis, flow cytometry, and molecular biology will undoubtedly augment our understanding of the origin, pathogenesis, and prognosis of prostate cancer.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed 125 male patients treated with a six-week course of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) for superficial transitional cell cancer (TCC) of the bladder that was associated with mucosal involvement of the prostatic urethra in 15 cases. In 13 of these cases, there was a sustained complete response in both the bladder and the prostate. Among the other 110 patients, in 14 TCC developed in the prostate from one to fifty-three (mean 15) months after completion of BCG. Six of these 14 had had complete response in the bladder. Recurrent TCC in the prostate was seen in only 4 percent and 6 percent of patients who had prostatic urethritis on cystoscopy and prostatic granulomas on biopsy, respectively. In contrast, recurrence was observed in 14 percent of those without urethritis and in 44 percent of those without granulomas. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) prior to BCG did not appear to influence tumor recurrence in the prostate. However, after BCG, 3 patients with recurrent TCC in the prostate had complete local response after TURP alone. Further, prostatic urethritis (73%) and prostatic granulomas (60%) were more frequent among patients who had TURP prior to BCG than in those without TURP (33% and 27%, respectively). Superficial TCC of the bladder associated with mucosal involvement of the prostatic urethra can be treated successfully with intravesical BCG. In addition, our results suggest that intravesical BCG has a prophylactic effect on tumor recurrence in the prostate, and that TURP may have an important role by removing present disease and by facilitating the development of an effective biologic response to BCG in the prostate. TCC in the prostate is a significant cause of relapse, and frequent surveillance of the prostatic urethra should be performed in conservatively treated patients with superficial bladder cancer.\r"

Fifty-one of 145 patients (32.2%) presented a pathologic cavernosal drainage via a single venous system; 94/145 (64.8%) showed a combined venous leakage. The type of leakage corresponded neither to the maintenance flow nor to the response to intracavernosal injections. Our findings show that standardized intracavernosal testing and Doppler have a high predictive value for the status of the venous occlusive system. Exact evaluation of the type of leakage can be made by bidimensional cavernosography only.\r"

Before drawing out the needle, small amounts of thrombin and protamine were injected to prevent the injected blood from leaking. Of the 16 ureters treated (13 patients) with international grade I-III reflux, 9 showed complete absence of reflux. The technique is advantageous because it is technically simple and injection can be repeated until the reflux had disappeared. Furthermore, no complications such as distant migration of injected material or escape from the bladder mucosa have been observed. However, the treatment is not consistently successful in cases of high-grade reflux. After the operation, mucosal swelling of ureteral orifice and narrowing of the intramuscular ureter were observed by ultrasonography. The mean pressure of the intramuscular ureter increased 10 cm H2O after the operation. These consequences of the operation may prevent vesicoureteral reflux.\r"

In addition to surgical technique modifications, we present technical refinements of patient positioning, use of cold antibiotic mixed saline, subcutaneous epinephrine at judicious sites, and microsurgical instruments as well as optical magnification and suture material. In genital anomalies, use of plastic surgical techniques with skin grafts and knowledge of the intrinsic vascular supply of the foreskin have further improved the outcome. Since 1982, 100 patients have been followed. Immediate complications total less than 1 percent; late complications total 10 percent including 9 percent fistula rate and 5 percent stenosis rate (urethral or meatal). No loss of skin flap or of neourethra were recorded.\r"

The bacterial populations demonstrated a heterogeneity that was not evident from the culture results, and it was demonstrated that only a small proportion of the microorganisms, including fungi, identified morphologically by scanning or transmission electron microscopy are recovered by routine culture methods. The persistence of the bacterial pathogens in catheter-associated infection, even in the face of antibiotic treatment, may be attributed to their adherent mode of growth in protected biofilms and their production of extensive enveloping anionic glycocalyces.\r"

Treatment consists of adequate hydration to help prevent oliguric or anuric renal failure without additional calcium or bicarbonate supplementation in most cases.

The difference in five-year survival rates between patients with combined nuclear grade 1-3 tumors (n = 50, 91%) and grade 4 tumors (n = 5, 9%) was significant (P less than 0.0046). Other predictors of death due to renal cell carcinoma included: tumor size greater than 8 cm (P less than 0.001) and mitoses greater than one per 10 high-power field (P less than 0.01). Within Stage I tumors, therefore, nuclear grade is an important morphologic variable for predicting long-term survival. Identification of nuclear grade 4 neoplasms may become prognostically indispensable to determine the metastatic potential of early-stage tumors and thereby to institute appropriate systemic therapy.\r"

Male subjects received the following treatments in randomized crossover fashion for 14 days: three 0.125-mg digoxin tablets or three 0.1-mg digoxin capsules once daily. Female subjects received digoxin on the same schedule but at two-thirds the dose. Serum and urine samples were collected and analyzed for digoxin by radioimmunoassay, and treatments were compared by evaluating pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean area under the serum concentration versus time curve for tablets (28.1 h.nmol/L [21.9 h.ng/mL]) was smaller (p less than 0.03) than that for capsules (31.1 h.nmol/L [24.3 h.ng/mL]), and the mean maximum serum digoxin concentration for tablets (2.9 nmol/L [2.3 ng/mL]) was lower (p less than 0.02) than that for capsules (4.0 nmol/L [3.1 ng/mL]). There was no difference in cumulative urinary excretion of digoxin between the two treatments. In contrast to previous reports, we observed that digoxin from Lanoxin Tablets appears to be well absorbed in subjects with malabsorption. Nevertheless, these subjects absorbed digoxin from capsules better than from tablets, with the greatest differences occurring in subjects without a colon and in those subjects with the lowest serum carotene concentrations.\r"

Because the newer triphasic oral contraceptives provide effective contraception with a method of administration that mimics normal hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle, some prescribers may infer that these products are associated with a decreased incidence of adverse effects over alternative oral contraceptives. We present two cases of idiopathic thromboembolism associated with the use of a triphasic oral contraceptive with a discussion of the proposed pathogenic mechanisms for these events.\r"

Patterns of antidiarrheal drug use are compared with the recommended practices regarding both prophylactic and symptomatic therapy. Generally, the subjects in this study adhered closely to recommended practices. Nevertheless, although a majority employed dietary restrictions for TD prevention, 22.8 percent took antidiarrheal drugs prophylactically. Nearly half took antidiarrheal agents for symptomatic use. The ingredients most frequently mentioned matched current recommendations. Inappropriate practices included the use of prophylactic agents without dietary restrictions, and the use of antimotility agents prophylactically. Patterns of dietary and antidiarrheal drug use are compared, including intended versus actual, prophylactic versus symptomatic, and prescription versus nonprescription product use. The controversy regarding the use of prophylactic drug therapy for TD is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We compared digital and analog radiographs of the chest for use in detecting and evaluating a variety of cardiopulmonary devices in 40 patients. The devices included 23 endotracheal tubes, 21 Swan-Ganz catheters, 14 central venous pressure catheters, 11 prosthetic valves, 10 chest tubes, six pacemaker wires, and five intraaortic balloon pumps. Each patient had at least one device, with a maximum of five devices (average, 2.3). Forty digital/analog film pairs were compared by five radiologists, who assigned confidence levels for various judgments about each device. The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences in the identification of the devices except for prosthetic valves (all valves were detected on digital radiographs, compared with 62% on analog radiographs). The devices were detected on 96% of the digital radiographs and 90% of the analog radiographs. Although digital and analog radiographs were comparable for detection of most devices, the digital radiographs allowed greater confidence in the identification of the devices and in the identification of the tip and course of Swan-Ganz and central venous pressure catheters.\r"

We compared the high-spatial-frequency and standard algorithms in the evaluation of normal and abnormal lung parenchyma and mediastinum on conventional 10-mm-collimation CT scans. Three observers, blinded to the reconstruction algorithm used, compared both algorithms on identical images in 31 patients with a variety of diseases. Lung parenchymal detail was improved with the bone algorithm in 94% of scans (p less than .001). The definition of mediastinal contents with the bone algorithm was judged equal or superior to the standard algorithm in 94% of images (p less than .001). Scanning of a line-pair-resolution phantom demonstrated a 28% improvement in image resolution with the bone algorithm. Although the bone algorithm resulted in an increase in visible noise, the overall visual quality of the images was considered equal to or greater than that of those reconstructed on the standard algorithm in 100% of parenchymal (p less than .001) and 85% of mediastinal (p less than .001) images. We conclude that routine use of the bone algorithm results in improved spatial resolution and definition of pulmonary parenchymal detail without appreciably degrading the overall visual quality of mediastinal images.\r"

In order to reassess the significance of these findings, and to determine the presence of any other changes that might lead to a definitive diagnosis, we retrospectively reviewed the chest radiographs of nine patients who had tears or transection of the trachea and/or main bronchi as a result of blunt chest trauma. The diagnosis was proved by bronchoscopy in all patients and reconfirmed at surgery in five. The predominant findings on the chest radiographs were related to air leak and included subcutaneous emphysema (seven patients), pneumomediastinum (seven patients), pneumothorax (six patients), and air surrounding a bronchus in one patient. Upper thoracic fractures that involved the clavicles, scapula, sternum, and ribs were present in four patients. Abnormalities in the appearance of an endotracheal tube in two patients (overdistention of the cuff or extraluminal position of the tip), and the presence of the fallen lung sign (collapse of the lung toward the lateral chest wall) in two others provided specific evidence of tracheobronchial injury. We conclude that, although the major importance of the chest radiograph in patients with tracheobronchial transection may be to verify the existence of air leak, the presence of the fallen lung sign and endotracheal tube abnormalities is a reliable indication of airway injury.\r"

Portable chest radiography was performed daily for about 10 days, after which upright posteroanterior studies were performed daily for about 10 days, and then as clinically required. CT was performed when a complication was suspected. The reimplantation response (noncardiogenic pulmonary edema due to ischemia, trauma, denervation, and lymphatic interruption) occurred in 12 patients and usually consisted of bilateral perihilar and basal consolidation. Twelve episodes of acute rejection, an imprecise clinical diagnosis, occurred in 10 patients. Radiographic changes consisted of bibasal (n = 2), right mid and lower (n = 2), or left basal consolidation (n = 1); there were no changes in seven episodes. Radiographic resolution occurred in four cases after administration of IV steroids. The radiographic findings associated with the reimplantation response and rejection were nonspecific and were mimicked by fluid overload and infection. Bronchial dehiscence and/or stricture formation occurred in seven patients; generally chest radiography was inaccurate and CT was very accurate in the assessment of these complications. Chest radiography was helpful but not definitive in sorting out the problems occurring in the postoperative period after bilateral lung transplantation. CT was excellent for use in demonstrating airway problems.\r"

In two cases (5%), the calcium was not contained within the tumor but was located next to it. In one of these cases, the calcium was within 4 mm of the malignant neoplasm and in the other it was within 13 mm. No difference was seen between the appearance of the calcifications located within the tumor and the appearance of calcification next to the tumor. Precise histologic analysis revealed that microcalcifications that had prompted biopsy were confined to the tumor in 63%, within and contiguous to the tumor in 32%, and within 13 mm of the tumor in 5%.\r"

  ".U": "90053053\r", 
  ".W": "We compared the effect of high-density and low-density barium preparations on the quantitative features of swallowing. The two barium preparations differed primarily in density but also differed somewhat in viscosity. Concurrent videofluoroscopic and manometric studies were done in nine healthy control subjects. Videofluoroscopy was recorded in the lateral projection at 30 frames/sec while concurrent manometry was done with five intraluminal transducers that straddled the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter. Swallows of 5 and 10 ml of high- and low-density barium preparations were recorded. Analysis indicated that, compared with the low-density barium (1.4 g/cm3), the high-density barium (2.5 g/cm3) preparation had a slower oral and pharyngeal bolus transit time and caused significant quantitative differences in the function of the upper esophageal sphincter. Compared with low-density barium boluses, the high-density barium boluses were associated with later sphincter opening and closure, longer duration of sphincter opening and flow, lower flow rate, greater maximal anterior hyoid movement, greater sagittal sphincter diameter, and higher intrabolus pressure upstream of and within the sphincter. We conclude that the density as well as the viscosity of the barium preparation used in radiologic examination of the oral-pharyngeal phases of swallowing has an influence on bolus transit time through the mouth and pharynx, and on the quantitative features of upper esophageal sphincter opening. Although these quantitative differences cannot generally be recognized visually at fluoroscopy, they become important for the quantitative assessment of swallowing in patients with suspected disorders of oral-pharyngeal swallowing. Therefore, the basic barium preparations used to examine such patients should be either standardized or at least specified.\r"

The main pattern of swallowing was of the tipper type, in which swallowing is initiated with the tip of the tongue against the incisors and the bolus is in a supralingual position. However, a second pattern of a dipper-type swallow occurred, in which part of the bolus initially is positioned beneath the anterior part of the tongue. This circumstance requires that the tongue dip beneath the bolus in order to elevate the bolus above the tongue. Dipper swallows occurred in all age groups, but were more prevalent in subjects 60 years or older. Recognition of this component in normal swallowing patterns is essential for optimal evaluation of normal subjects and patients with an abnormal oral phase of swallowing.\r"

Fourteen patients had hepatic metastases and one patient each had cholangiocarcinoma and multicentric hepatocellular carcinoma. Four patients had cavernous hemangiomas and the remainder had other benign lesions. Diagnoses were proved by biopsy, sonography, or radionuclide scintigraphy in 23 cases and by autopsy in one case. Precontrast scans were obtained by using standard pulse sequences. In addition, breath-hold scans were obtained before and after bolus administration of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA by using a multislice T1-weighted gradient-echo pulse sequence with an ultrashort echo time. Mean lesion-liver signal difference/noise increased by 50% (p less than .01) in the immediate postcontrast phase. In two of 26 cases, multiple additional lesions as small as 3 mm were detected after contrast administration that were not seen before contrast administration. In no case was lesion-liver contrast worsened on scans obtained immediately after administration of contrast material. However, on delayed scans, detection of lesions worsened in some cases because of equilibration of contrast material between liver and lesion. These initial clinical results suggest that enhancement with Gd-DTPA is a practical method for improving lesion-liver contrast and has the potential to improve the accuracy of MR imaging in the liver. However, optimized fast imaging techniques are required for best results.\r"

  ".W": "Are the methods used by radiologists in interpreting imaging studies different from those of attending physicians? We evaluated the influence that knowledge of localizing clinical signs has on the accuracy of fracture detection by orthopedic surgeons and compared the results with those of an identical study of radiologists performed earlier. The orthopedists studied had the same degree of experience as the radiologists. Forty radiographs of the extremities were examined twice by seven orthopedic surgeons. In 26 cases, a subtle fracture was present; 14 cases were normal. During one interpretation of the radiographs of each case, the precise location of pain, tenderness, or swelling was provided; during the other, this information was withheld. Analysis of receiver-operating-characteristic parameters indicates that the clues regarding location of trauma facilitate detection of fractures by orthopedists (an 11% improvement in Az, the area under the ROC curve, F[1,12] = 49.67, p less than .001). This finding is similar to the results of the earlier study with radiologists (a 6% improvement in Az, F[1,12] = 14.77, p less than .005). Statistical comparison of the two experiments showed that orthopedists depend on this information much more than do radiologists, demonstrated by a statistically significant prompting-by-specialty interaction (F[1,12] = 5.13, p less than .05). Localization clues improve ability of orthopedic surgeons to detect fractures in the trauma patient even more than they improve the ability of radiologists. The accuracy of the radiologist will suffer less than that of the orthopedist when localization clues are unavailable. Nonetheless, the findings show that localizing clues are important to both orthopedists and radiologists when searching for fractures.\r"

This is particularly true for those patients without access to MR or those whose referring physicians prefer arthrography to other techniques for diagnosing internal derangements. Ionic and nonionic contrast agents were compared in a randomized, double-blind trial to determine if pain could be decreased by using a nonionic contrast material. Forty patients received either Omnipaque 300 (nonionic, iohexol) or Hypaque 60 (ionic, diatrizoate meglumine). Radiographs were assessed for diagnostic quality, and patients were asked to note their level of discomfort. No significant differences between the agents were detected. Maximal discomfort was noted at 24 hr. Discomfort was classified as none, mild, or moderate, with no patients describing marked discomfort. This study does not support the use of nonionic contrast agents over the less expensive ionic agents for decreasing pain or improving film quality in temporomandibular joint arthrography.\r"

Of 200 women with a history of diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero, 12 had undergone hysterosalpingography as part of an infertility workup. Five of these volunteered to undergo MR imaging of the pelvis. Hysterosalpingography showed abnormalities in all five patients. Abnormalities included hypoplasia of the uterine cavity (3/5), a T-shaped uterine cavity (3/5), constrictions of the uterine cavity (3/5), irregular margins of the uterine cavity (2/5), bilateral hydrosalpinges (2/5), and a diverticulum of a fallopian tube (1/5). MR images showed abnormalities in all five patients. These included hypoplasia of the uterine cavity, uterine corpus, and cervix (3/5); a T-shaped uterine cavity (3/5); constrictions of the uterine cavity (3/5); and bilateral hydrosalpinges (2/5). There was an excellent correlation between the findings on MR images and those on hysterosalpingograms. A thick junctional zone was identified on MR as the cause of constrictions of the uterine cavity seen on hysterosalpingography. MR failed to show the irregular margins of the uterine cavity in two of five cases and a diverticulum of the fallopian tube. We conclude that MR can be used to detect hypoplasia and other congenital abnormalities of the uterus in women with a history of diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero.\r"

Scans were interpreted by three radiologists, and the results were compared with those from pelvic CT scans made from normal, age-matched, nonpregnant women. In addition to soft-tissue windows, bone windows also were obtained to assess the pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints in both the postpartum women and the control subjects. The mean uterine length, transverse width, and anteroposterior diameter in the postpartum women (14 +/- 1.4, 12 +/- 1.5, and 9 +/- 1.6 cm, respectively) were significantly larger than in the nonpregnant women (7 +/- 1.4, 5 +/- 0.8, and 4 +/- 0.9 cm) (p less than .0001). CT scans showed intrauterine blood in nine of the postpartum women (64%), and three (21%) had intrauterine gas. There was widening of the sacroiliac joint in one (7%) of the postpartum women compared with none of the control subjects. Widening of the pubic symphysis was present in six (42%) of the postpartum women and in none of the control subjects. Six (42%) of the postpartum women had gas in the sacroiliac joints, 33% of which occurred bilaterally; gas in the pubic symphysis was seen in four (28%) of the postpartum scans. In one patient, an asymptomatic muscle hematoma was discovered. We conclude that normal changes in the pelvis after uncomplicated term vaginal delivery include enlargement of the uterus, intrauterine blood, widening of the symphysis and sacroiliac joints, and gas in the sacroiliac joints.\r"

Seven (21%) of 33 patients had bladder injuries (seven--two in one patient) and/or posterior urethral injuries (three) as determined on the basis of urethrocystography. Three patients had extraperitoneal bladder tears as the only injury to the lower urinary tract. Two patients had both extraperitoneal bladder tears and posterior urethral injuries. One patient had both an extraperitoneal tear at the bladder base and an intraperitoneal rupture at the bladder dome. The seventh patient had an isolated posterior urethral injury. All seven bladder injuries were detected with CT. In these cases, CT findings included (1) free intraperitoneal contrast material (one case), (2) focal contrast extravasation (three cases), and (3) paravesical fluid collections that on delayed CT scans revealed contrast accumulation in the fluid, indicating extravasation (two cases). The seventh bladder injury was suspected on CT and confirmed with retrograde urethrography. Only one of three posterior urethral injuries was detected with CT. Our results suggest that CT is sensitive in the detection of bladder injuries, but not for the diagnosis of urethral injuries.\r"

  ".W": "Knowledge of the length of the uterine end of the fallopian tube and the presence of tubal adhesions and fistulas is important when surgical reversal is undertaken in patients who have had tubal ligation. We retrospectively studied hysterosalpingograms in 127 such patients to determine their value in providing this information. The ligation was performed by using the Pomeroy technique in 57 patients. Sixty-one patients had bipolar electrocautery, six had Falope rings inserted, and three had Hulka clips applied. In all cases, the uterine ends of the tube were visualized to a point of obstruction. The sites of occlusion after Pomeroy ligation were midtubal (46%), cornual (16%), proximal ampullary (16%), proximal isthmic (14%), and intramural (8%). After the electrocautery procedure, the sites of occlusion were proximal isthmic (45%), intramural (20%), midtubal (19%), cornual (15%), and proximal ampullary (1%). When Falope rings and Hulka clips were used, the most frequent site of occlusion was midtubal (50%). Tubal adhesions, consistent with successful occlusion, were detected in 16 patients on the basis of a small confined area of extravasation of contrast material at the site of ligation. Tuboperitoneal fistulas, identified by the presence of contrast material spilled from the uterine end of the tube into the peritoneal cavity, were detected in five patients. Our results show that hysterosalpingography is a useful technique for determining the status of the uterine end of the fallopian tube after ligation when reversal of ligation is planned.\r"

  ".W": "We performed a prospective study of 70 infants and children with recurrent sinusitis. We compared plain radiographs with coronal CT scans of the sinuses to determine if plain radiographs can be used to accurately diagnose and localize residual sinus disease amenable to endoscopic surgery. This residual disease is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of recurrences of sinusitis. The patients were taking antibiotics and were clinically well at the time of the two examinations (performed on the same day). Findings on slightly over 80% of the CT scans were abnormal. In about 75% of the patients, the findings on plain radiographs did not correlate with those on CT scans. About 45% of the patients had normal findings on plain radiographs of at least one sinus with an abnormality of that sinus shown on CT scans. Almost 35% of the patients had what was interpreted as an abnormality of at least one sinus on plain radiographs, but that sinus was normal on CT scans. Sinusitis in infants and children is often underdiagnosed or overdiagnosed on the basis of findings on plain radiographs of the sinuses. Plain radiographs cannot be used to determine the need for, or to guide, endoscopic surgery on the sinuses.\r"

Precontrast T1- and T2-weighted scans and postcontrast T1-weighted scans were obtained. No complications or significant adverse reactions were encountered. Contrast enhancement was seen in 14 lesions from seven patients, but each of these patients had some abnormality also present on precontrast images. Contrast enhancement was thought to be extremely helpful in characterizing four primary tumors and moderately helpful in characterizing four other lesions. Absence of contrast enhancement was helpful in clarifying the nature of abnormalities seen in an additional four patients. Gd-DTPA may be used safely in children, but this study does not support its routine administration. The highest incremental diagnostic yield from its use will likely be among patients with suspected neoplasms or inflammatory diseases and among those requiring further characterization of lesions seen on precontrast scans.\r"

Most pineal tumors occurred in the first three decades of life, with the exception of pineocytomas, which were seen at a mean age of 34. A male preponderance was noted in the various pineal tumors, except for pineocytomas. The most common tumor of the pineal region was germinoma, which usually showed high density with homogeneously intense enhancement after IV administration of contrast medium. An increased prevalence of pineal calcification was also a feature of pineal germinomas. No characteristic CT features could be found to differentiate among pineal choriocarcinoma, germinoma, embryonal carcinoma, yolk-sac tumor, pineocytoma, and pineoblastoma. CT is useful in detecting intracranial tumors, but the definite diagnosis should depend on pathologic examination and detection of tumor markers in the serum and CSF.\r"

The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) was divided into proximal (brainstem, preganglionic, gasserian ganglion, and cavernous sinus) and distal (extracranial V1, V2, and V3) segments. Lesions were organized according to segments and correlated with the type and distribution of clinical symptoms or signs. The purpose of the study was to (1) determine the efficacy of clinical localization of cranial nerve V lesions, (2) compare CT and MR for cranial nerve V imaging, (3) develop an MR protocol for effective cranial nerve V imaging, and (4) construct a differential diagnosis by anatomic segment for lesions of cranial nerve V. Clinical localization was found to be extremely inaccurate. CT was not as sensitive as MR for lesions involving the basal cisterns and skull base and will not detect the most common brainstem lesions (small infarcts and multiple sclerosis plaques). The MR protocol developed does not rely heavily on clinical localization. On the basis of lesions found in this series, a differential diagnosis by segment was developed. Patients with cranial nerve V symptoms should undergo MR imaging according to the protocol provided in this article. CT is not as effective as MR in imaging some cranial nerve V segments. Clinical localization is inaccurate.\r"

  ".W": "MR and clinical data on 31 patients with posterior fossa CSF collections were analyzed. A clear separation of these patients into classical categories was not possible because of new information obtained from the MR images. We present a new classification of these disorders. The Dandy-Walker malformation, Dandy-Walker variant, and mega-cisterna magna seem to represent a continuum of developmental anomalies of the posterior fossa. A possible embryologic basis for this continuum is suggested. Discrete posterior fossa CSF collections that are clearly separate from the fourth ventricle and vallecula are classified as posterior fossa cysts. Posterior fossa CSF collections that communicate with the fourth ventricle and are associated with cerebellar atrophy are classified as prominent cisterna magna. Both the Dandy-Walker complex and posterior fossa cysts can cause enlargement of the posterior fossa and scalloping of the inner table of the occipital bone. The Dandy-Walker complex presents with seizures, developmental delay, and enlarging head size; it requires CSF diversion when associated with hydrocephalus. Posterior fossa cysts present with symptoms of a posterior fossa mass; they generally require surgical resection. Prominent cisterna magna is a result of degenerative disorders and requires no surgical therapy. This new classification facilitates both diagnosis and therapy of these disorders. MR revealed that disorders previously referred to as the Dandy-Walker malformation, the Dandy-Walker variant, and the mega-cisterna magna actually are not separate entities, but appear to represent steps on a continuum of developmental anomalies of the posterior fossa. Because of this, we suggest a new term, the Dandy-Walker complex, be used to describe this continuum.\r"

We report the results of renal artery angioplasty in 18 patients, 10 with severe bilateral renal artery stenosis and eight with severe renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney. Twenty-five (89%) of 28 angioplasties were successful, with a mean improvement of the degree of stenosis from 85% to 18% after angioplasty and a restoration of renal blood flow. A significant drop in mean blood pressure at admission of 187/101 mm Hg to 154/87 mm Hg at discharge, 152/86 mm Hg at 3-month, and 146/82 mm Hg at 1-year follow-up was seen. Because of the decrease in blood pressure, 11 of the patients decreased or stopped taking diuretics and 15 decreased or stopped taking antihypertensive medications. Although no significant change in renal function was found by measuring mean serum creatinine levels over time, no patient had an elevated serum creatinine level at follow-up, indicating preservation of renal function. One major complication, cholesterol embolization to the bowel, was seen. Our results suggest that angioplasty is an acceptable treatment of hypertension in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis in a single kidney.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are cardiovascular risk factors that commonly coexist. Studies have indicated that it is important to control both risk factors to achieve significant reductions in morbidity and mortality. Recent debate has focused upon whether traditional step I antihypertensive agents can substantially lower these risks because of their effects on plasma lipids. This debate continues to be unresolved. However, for the patient with elevated lipid levels, diuretics and beta-blockers may make the management of the lipid disorder more difficult. Therefore it may be desirable to select alternative step I antihypertensive agents that will not interfere with the therapy for hyperlipidemia. Alternative step I agents include alpha 1-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. These agents either have no effect on plasma lipids or they improve the lipid profile. Generally, these drugs are well tolerated and provide good alternatives for patients with hyperlipidemias. The initial drug of choice can be chosen depending upon other patient variables such as age, race, or concomitant diseases.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the merits of oral dipyridamole SPECT thallium-201 imaging in detecting CAD and multivessel CAD. The 65 patients included in this study (aged 62 +/- 11 years) were not candidates for exercise testing (for the usual reasons). Coronary arteriography revealed no significant CAD in 17 patients and greater than or equal to 50% narrowing of one or more vessels in 48 patients; 12 had one-vessel and 36 had multivessel CAD (high-risk group). Thallium-201 was injected intravenously 45 minutes after an oral dose of 375 mg of dipyridamole, and SPECT imaging was performed within 10 minutes and 4 hours after injection. There were no serious side effects; only six patients (8%) had ST segment depression and 18 patients (28%) had chest pain. The heart rate increased from 74 +/- 15 beats/min at rest to 84 +/- 14 beats/min at peak effect (p = 0.001); the systolic blood pressure did not change (130 +/- 18 and 128 +/- 20 mm Hg, respectively, p = NS). The thallium images were abnormal in 6 of 17 patients (35%) with no CAD, in 7 of 12 patients with one-vessel disease (58%), and in 34 of 36 patients with multivessel CAD (94%) (p = 0.001). Twenty-one of 25 patients (84%) with a perfusion abnormality in more than one vascular territory had multivessel CAD assessed by angiography. Thus oral dipyridamole SPECT thallium-201 imaging is a safe and inexpensive method for the detection of CAD in patients who are otherwise not candidates for exercise testing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Normal artery autofluorescence correlated morphologically with the structural protein fibers elastin and collagen in the intima, media, and adventitia. Atherosclerotic plaque autofluorescence correlated morphologically with lipid or calcified deposits in the atheroma core. The autofluorescence of these deposits differed from that of elastin and collagen in distribution, intensity, and color, and increased with the severity of the plaque. We conclude that argon ion laser-excited autofluorescence in normal and atherosclerotic arteries correlates with morphology and has diagnostic potential in laser angiosurgery.\r"

Multivessel disease was present in 41 patients (58%). Eleven procedures (12.4%) were done for acute myocardial infarction. Of 253 lesions attempted, 242 (95.6%) were successfully dilated. Complications consisted of just a single urgent bypass operation (1.1%). At mean follow-up of 32 months, 50 patients (72.5%) were asymptomatic. Late events consisted of one death (1.4%), four nonfatal infarctions (5.8%), and seven bypass surgeries (10.1%). Seventeen patients (24.6%) required 25 repeat PTCAs; restenosis was present in 12 of these patients while progression of native disease was noted in nine patients. In the young patient with coronary artery disease, PTCA can be performed safely, with a high success rate and few complications. Though the 3-year survival is excellent, a significant proportion of these patients develop nonfatal infarction or require repeat PTCA or bypass surgery, often for progression of native disease in addition to restenosis.\r"

Following BMV, there was a significant reduction in transmitral end-diastolic pressure gradient from 23.1 +/- 5.8 to 7.6 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and a significant increase in mitral valve area from 1.06 +/- 0.29 to 2.64 +/- 1.35 cm2 (p less than 0.001), along with an increase in cardiac index from 3.40 +/- 1.18 to 4.26 +/- 1.46 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.01). Improvement in symptomatic status by at least one NYHA class was seen in all patients. Mild mitral regurgitation developed in four and moderate mitral regurgitation developed in one patient. Angiographic evidence of atrial septal defect was present in one patient. Follow-up at 8 to 12 weeks in 12 patients has shown sustained hemodynamic improvement. These short-term results indicate that BMV is an effective nonsurgical procedure for the management of patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis.\r"

Fifty-five patients were either asymptomatic or had recent onset angina (less than 5 days) before AMI (group A) and 17 patients had chronic angina (greater than 1 year) before AMI (group B). Coronary angiograms were performed at 20 days (range 15 to 25 days). Patency of the infarct-related artery was greater in group A: 43 of 55 patients (78%) versus 8 of 17 patients (47%) in group B (p less than 0.05). Residual stenosis was less than 70% in 21 patients of group A (49% of patent arteries), whereas it manifested in none of eight patients with patent arteries in group B (p less than 0.01). This suggests that thrombosis was a major component of the coronary artery narrowing in group A patients, while it is more likely that thrombus only completes a previously severe (greater than 70%) coronary artery stenosis in patients with long-standing angina before AMI.\r"

  ".W": "Antiarrhythmic drugs are often more effective in suppressing ventricular tachycardias than are background premature extrasystoles. The mechanism of action of these agents was examined by studies on the effects of lidocaine and quinidine on post-repolarization refractoriness of both basic and premature action potentials. In the absence of antiarrhythmic drugs, the excitability threshold was relatively constant after the end of repolarization of both basic and premature action potentials. In the presence of lidocaine or quinidine, the strength-interval curves were shifted to the right and superiorly, and the two drugs had different effects on the course of the strength-interval curve and Vmax recovery, presumably due to use-dependent V max block. Moreover, depressions of Vmax and excitability were more marked after the premature action potential than after the basic action potential. These results suggest that lidocaine and quinidine cause more depression of the excitability of second premature contractions than of first premature contractions, and also indicate that for protection against sustained ventricular tachycardias, it may not be necessary to suppress chronic premature ventricular contractions.\r"

Testing was conducted 1 day prior to and a mean of 39 (range 10 to 95) days following cardioversion. Heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory gas exchange responses were evaluated at rest, at a standard submaximal workload (3.0 mph/0% grade), at the gas exchange anaerobic threshold, and at maximal exertion. Cardioversion resulted in a mean decrease in resting heart rate of 37 beats/min (113 +/- 16 versus 76 +/- 10 beats/min, p less than 0.001). While mean heart rate was approximately 50 beats/min lower following cardioversion at both submaximal stages of exercise p less than 0.001), oxygen uptake was not different. At maximal exercise, heart rate was markedly reduced (192 +/- 24 to 144 +/- 21 beats/min, p less than 0.001) and maximal oxygen uptake was higher (1.86 +/- 0.5 to 2.06 +/- 0.5 L/min, p less than 0.05) after cardioversion. In addition, an improved efficiency of ventilation was observed at exercise levels exceeding 60% of maximal oxygen uptake.\r"

Adding rate responsiveness to DDD pacing would theoretically benefit patients with an inability to increase their atrial rate. We evaluated 20 patients who had long-term implanted DDD pacemakers as to the utility of an added effect of rate responsiveness. The pacemakers had been implanted for an average of 34 months. This patient group included 15 patients with atrioventricular (AV) block and five patients with sick sinus syndrome. All patients were exercised on the treadmill until they were fatigued and were monitored to determine their intrinsic heart rate response. A sensor-driven pacemaker was strapped to the patients and was connected to an ECG to measure its rate response. It was set to activity threshold of medium, with a rate response of 7. The 20 patients exercised for an average of 5.9 minutes, with a range of 1.7 to 10 minutes. The maximum intrinsic atrial response averaged 110 beats/min, ranging from 60 to 150 beats/min. The maximum achieved activity rate averaged 99 beats/min, ranging from 60 to 118 beats/min. In 7 of the 20 of patients (35%), the activity pacemaker reached a higher rate than the patient's intrinsic rate. Six had AV block and one had sick sinus syndrome. In these seven patients the peak activity rate response averaged 102 beats/min and their intrinsic activity averaged to 78 beats/min. There was an increase in rate by the addition of rate responsiveness in 35% of our DDD patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twelve patients had evidence of organic heart disease. Ten control subjects with no history of syncope were studied similarly. Syncope did not occur in any of these controls. Syncope occurred in 15 patients (37.5%) after a mean standing time of 42 +/- 12 minutes. Syncope was due to a typical vasovagal reaction in 11 patients and to hyperventilation in three patients. One last patient fainted without changes in heart rate or blood pressure. In each case, symptoms during the test resembled those previously experienced.\r"

  ".W": "Smoking \"crack\" is currently popular; this results in rapidly peaking, high blood levels of cocaine. Our purpose was to investigate the effects of rapid cocaine administration. Hemodynamics, myocardial blood flow, and left ventricular cavity end-systolic and end-diastolic areas were measured in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs before and 15 minutes after (1) a bolus intravenous injection of cocaine (n = 6), or (2) a 10-minute infusion of cocaine (n = 6), or (3) saline (n = 6) administration. In both treated groups cocaine caused a significant reduction in heart rate and left ventricular dP/dt compared with baseline measurements, and an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Cocaine also caused dilation of the left ventricle and a fall in regional myocardial blood flow. In nine other dogs, proximal circumflex artery diameter, assessed by angiography, and regional myocardial blood flow were measured before and 3 to 5 minutes after cocaine (n = 7) or saline (n = 2). In treated animals, circumflex artery diameter was reduced 15 +/- 4% (range 2% to 29%, p less than 0.01 versus baseline) after cocaine. We conclude that in this model, rapid administration of cocaine depresses left ventricular function, causes left ventricular dilation, and is associated with coronary artery vasoconstriction and reduced myocardial blood flow.\r"

After a baseline exercise treadmill test, subjects were randomized to oral therapy groups of atenolol, 50 mg daily (AT 50), atenolol, 100 mg daily (AT 100), propranolol, 80 mg twice a day (Prop), or placebo. Repeat exercise tests were performed at week 1, week 8, and at week 9, with week 8 to 9 being a 1-week drug-free washout period. At week 8, maximal oxygen consumption (Max VO2), when compared with baseline levels, was increased slightly in AT 50 (4.2%) and Prop (2.4%), decreased in AT 100 (5.3%), and increased significantly in the placebo group (12.7%). After washout, Max VO2 increased significantly compared with baseline in AT 50, AT 100, and Prop (9.8%, 10.8%, and 9.8%, respectively). We conclude that there is no significant difference between selective and nonselective beta-blockade therapy in the development of a training effect. This effect, however, may not become apparent until the drug is withdrawn.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the accuracy of the exercise-induced decrease in the ratio of peak flow velocity in atrial systole to that in early diastole (A/E) for predicting an elevation of left ventricular filling pressure, supine bicycle ergometer exercise testing was performed in 27 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease. Doppler-derived transmitral flow velocities were recorded at rest and immediately after exercise. A/E decreased during exercise in 16 patients (group A) and increased in 11 (group B). Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) increased notably from 7 mm Hg at rest to 26 mm Hg at peak exercise in group A (p less than 0.001). In contrast, PAWP increased slightly from 6 mm Hg to 10 mm Hg in group B (p less than 0.05). The cardiac index at peak exercise in group A was significantly lower than that in group B (p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that patients with an exercise-induced decrease in A/E might not increase their cardiac output. A significant negative correlation between PAWP and A/E was observed in patients with PAWP over 20 mm Hg (r = -0.74; p less than 0.005). The exercise-induced decrease in A/E showed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 73%, and a predictive accuracy of 85% in detecting patients with PAWP over 20 mm Hg. These findings show that Doppler recordings of transmitral flow velocities during dynamic exercise can provide useful information concerning exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction associated with markedly elevated filling pressures.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred nineteen consecutive patients referred for echocardiography were analyzed to determine the occurrence of mitral regurgitation (MR) in the absence of intrinsic abnormalities of the mitral leaflets. MR was assessed by means of the pulsed-Doppler technique. There was a higher incidence of MR associated with absence of mitral leaflet abnormalities compared to the presence of these abnormalities (59% vs 41%, p less than 0.01). The most common causes of MR were mitral annular calcification (MAC) and incomplete mitral leaflet closure (IMLC). The extent of calcific deposit in patients with MAC and the distance from the mitral leaflet coaptation point to the mitral annular plane in systole patients with IMLC correlated well with the severity of MR by Doppler technique (rho = 0.91 and 0.71, respectively). To determine the mechanisms of MR in these two conditions, 29 consecutive patients with MAC and 28 with IMLC were referred to the echocardiography laboratory, and 10 age-matched control subjects were prospectively analyzed. Patients with MAC had a 50% reduction in the sphincteric action of the mitral anulus in systole compared to control subjects. All patients with IMLC had poor left ventricular systolic function; most had left ventricular, mitral annular, and left atrial dilation, and only eight had regional wall motion abnormalities. When discriminant function analysis was used, poor left ventricular systolic function was the principal variable that separated patients with IMLC from normal subjects (F = 81.6, p less than 0.0001). We conclude that: (1) MR in adults occurs most commonly in the absence of intrinsic abnormalities of the mitral leaflets, primarily those resulting from MAC and IMLC; (2) MR in patients with MAC results from a reduced sphincteric action of the mitral anulus in systole; and (3) IMLC results from poor left ventricular systolic function, irrespective of the cause.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular performance was studied during isometric exercise in 17 patients with severe congestive heart failure, combining invasive hemodynamic and echo-Doppler techniques. Isometric exercise at 30% of maximum resulted in a decrease in stroke volume index (27.4 +/- 7.1 to 22.7 +/- 7.4 ml/m2), with a significant increase in heart rate from 81 +/- 10 to 92 +/- 14 beats/min and in systemic vascular resistance from 1827 +/- 527 to 2372 +/- 737 dyne.sec.cm-5. A significant rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (18 +/- 9 to 31 +/- 10 mm Hg) was associated with a marked increase in mitral regurgitant volume (14 +/- 11 to 27 +/- 15 ml), calculated as the difference between total stroke volume obtained by two-dimensional echocardiography and forward stroke volume measured by pulsed Doppler at the aortic anulus. During isometric exercise, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes did not change markedly, but the total stroke volume tended to increase from 62 +/- 13 to 67 +/- 13 ml. The increase in mitral regurgitant volume induced by isometric exercise was correlated with the fall in forward stroke volume (r = 0.7, p less than 0.01). Thus a rise in systemic arterial pressure induced by isometric exercise is associated with a decrease in cardiac performance attributable to redistribution of total left ventricular output with an increase in mitral regurgitation and a simultaneous decrease in forward cardiac output.\r"

Therefore we examined the short-term effects of doxorubicin on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function following a total of 56 doses of doxorubicin in 15 patients with normal resting left ventricular function. Resting radionuclide ventriculography was performed 1 hour before and 4 hours after each dose of doxorubicin. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased significantly from 64 +/- 1% to 67 +/- 1% (p less than 0.001) after doxorubicin. In addition, peak ejection rate (p less than 0.005) and peak filling rate (p less than 0.0005) increased significantly following short-term doxorubicin administration. There was no relationship between either the individual or cumulative dose of doxorubicin and the acute ejection fraction, peak ejection rate, or peak filling rate response. Our data suggest that doxorubicin acutely increases left ventricular systolic and diastolic function.\r"

Twenty-nine patients had a repeat study after balloon valvuloplasty, for a total of 63 DSA and RNA pressure-volume loops. All data were analyzed in a systemic fashion in order to minimize intra- and interobserver error. Linear regression analysis was used to calculate the degree of agreement between the two technologies. Left ventricular ejection fraction (RNA: 0.47 +/- 0.17, DSA: 0.49 +/- 0.18) had a correlation coefficient of 0.96; left ventricular end-diastolic volume (RNA: 171 +/- 42 ml, DAS: 168 +/- 52 ml) and end-systolic volume (RNA: 95 +/- 50 ml, DSA: 89 +/- 50 ml) had correlation coefficients of 0.89 and 0.95, respectively. Left ventricular stroke volume (RNA: 75 +/- 26 ml, DSA: 75 +/- 27 ml) had a correlation coefficient of 0.92, while integrated pressure-volume loop or stroke work (RNA: 15.6 +/- 6.6 ergs 10(6), DSA: 15.9 +/- 6.3 ergs 10(6] had a correlation coefficient of 0.89. These data demonstrate that RNA measurements of left ventricular chamber dynamics concur with that obtained with DSA. With semiautomated data analysis, the portable first-pass RNA pressure-volume data are also less labor-intensive. Moreover, multiple measurements of ventricular performance during hemodynamic manipulations in the catheterization laboratory or operating room would allow for a more precise estimation of left ventricular performance.\r"

The distensibility was found to be significantly lower (8%) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension than it was in normal subjects (23%). No age-related difference occurred. Magnetic resonance velocity mapping of the pulmonary artery blood flow was performed in 26 normal subjects--11 had mapping in the mid pulmonary artery, 15 had mapping in the distal pulmonary artery, and mapping in the four patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension was in the mid pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery flow volume was compared with aortic flow and left ventricular stroke volume and a very good correlation was found. A retrograde flow of 2% occurred in the normal subjects serving to close the pulmonic valve. Antegrade plug flow occurred in most normal subjects but varied among individuals. There were also other variations in the flow pattern among normal individuals. All patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension had a markedly irregular ante- and retrograde flow and a large retrograde flow (average 26%). Magnetic resonance imaging offers a noninvasive way to evaluate pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as to quantitate pulmonary and aortic flows in, for example, left-to-right shunts.\r"

The double product at an equivalent pacing time to the initial onset of angina was reduced after therapy from 15,590 +/- 1490 to 14,100 +/- 1193 with a reduction in ST segment shift from 11.9 +/- 9.4 mm2 to 6.2 +/- 5.6 mm2 (p less than 0.05).

NMR imaging detected several small pericardial effusions that were not visualized by echocardiography. Both techniques demonstrated loculation well, although NMR imaging was better for detecting fluid located superiorly at the aortic pericardial reflection site, medially at the border of the right atrium and posteriorly at the left ventricular apex. In the 14 patients with documented exudative effusions (10 pericardial, 4 pleural) NMR signals of varying intensity were present in the effusion. One patient had a documented transudative effusion and no NMR signal was observed in the fluid. NMR imaging clearly distinguished pericardial from pleural effusions.

  ".W": "In 16 insulin-dependent diabetic patients, 36 +/- 8 years old with no microangiopathy, hypertension or coronary artery disease, and 16 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age and body surface area, the following parameters were obtained by Doppler-echocardiography: (1) end-diastolic left ventricular thickness and radius; (2) aortic pulse wave velocity; (3) mitral flow with measurement of early and late (atrial) peak velocities (E and A), pressure half-time and the velocity time integrals of the entire mitral curve and of the atrial wave; and (4) isovolumic relaxation time (i.e., the time between aortic closure and the mitral opening signals recorded simultaneously by continuous-wave Doppler). Heart rate and systolic blood pressure were not different in the 2 groups. Aortic pulse wave velocity and the wall thickness to radius ratio were significantly increased in the diabetic patients compared to the controls. E was significantly reduced whereas A/E, pressure half-time, the atrial contribution to the left ventricular filling (i.e., the ratio of the atrial velocity time integral to the mitral velocity time integral) and the isovolumic relaxation time were significantly increased in the diabetic group versus the control subjects. Lastly, 11 of 16 diabetic patients (69%) had at least 2 of the following abnormalities: A/E greater than 0.71, an atrial contribution to the left ventricular filling greater than 0.25, a pressure half-time greater than 50 ms and an isovolumic relaxation time greater than 88 ms. No correlations were found between the wall thickness to radius ratio, aortic pulse wave velocity and the filling indexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ability of noninvasive risk stratification using dipyridamole-thallium-201 (Tl-201) imaging and radionuclide ventriculography to predict perioperative and long-term cardiac events (myocardial infarction or cardiac death) was evaluated in 36 uremic diabetic and 29 nondiabetic candidates for renal allograft surgery. Of the 35 patients who underwent renal allograft surgery 8 +/- 7 months after the study, none had transient Tl-201 defects (although 13 had depressed left ventricular ejection fraction) and none developed perioperative cardiac events. During a mean follow-up of 23 +/- 11 months, 6 (9%) patients developed cardiac events. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare the predictive value of clinical data (including age, sex, diabetes, chest pain history, allograft recipient) and radionuclide data. Presence of transient Tl-201 defect and left ventricular ejection fraction were the only significant predictors of future cardiac events (p less than 0.01). No other patient variables, including diabetes or receiving a renal allograft, had either univariate or multivariate predictive value. All 3 patients with transient Tl-201 defects had cardiac events compared with only 3 of 62 (5%) patients without transient Tl-201 defect (p less than 0.0001). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was lower in patients with cardiac events (44 +/- 13%) compared with patients without cardiac events (57 +/- 9%, p less than 0.005). Overall, 5 of 6 patients with cardiac events had either transient Tl-201 defects or depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Dipyridamole-Tl-201 imaging and radionuclide ventriculography may be helpful in identifying uremic candidates for renal allograft surgery who are at low risk for perioperative and long-term cardiac events.\r"

Subjects receiving dipyridamole were subdivided into group IIA (n = 11), who received an aminophylline injection 10 minutes after dipyridamole infusion, and group IIB (n = 13), who did not. The mean and highest washout rate values in each of 3 segments in the anterior, 45 degrees and 85 degrees left anterior oblique views were calculated. In group II the mean washout rate of thallium-201 was similar in all segments of each view and the overall mean washout rate did not differ between the 3 views studied. There was a good correlation between the mean and highest washout rate values in individual subjects (r = 0.98, p less than 0.001). The mean +/- standard deviation myocardial 4-hour washout rate of thallium-201 (anterior view) was 10 +/- 6% in group I compared with 40 +/- 14% in group IIA (p less than 0.05 vs group I), 31 +/- 13% in group IIB (p less than 0.05 vs group I) and 54 +/- 11% in group III (p less than 0.05 each vs group IIA and group IIB, respectively). There was a wide variation in mean washout rate values in group II (range 12 to 58%), and this variation was not altered by aminophylline administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sudden death in young competitive athletes is most commonly due to underlying cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography has the potential to identify structural cardiovascular abnormalities, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC), that have been incriminated in such events. In this study, echocardiography (2-dimensional and M-mode) was used as a primary screening test to assess 265 Howard University collegiate athletes for cardiovascular disease; 262 (99%) were black. Most athletes (234, 88%) had no definitive echocardiographic evidence of HC or other major cardiovascular diseases, but 30 (11%) had mitral valve prolapse, and 1 other athlete had a small atrial septal defect. In addition, 4 athletes were identified as having mild systemic hypertension. Most athletes (236 of 265) showed normal left ventricular wall thickness of less than or equal to 12 mm, but an important minority (29, 11%) had maximal ventricular septal thicknesses of greater than or equal to 13 mm that could not always be distinguished (by morphology alone) from mild anatomic expressions of nonobstructive HC. Based on this experience, preparticipation athletic screening using echocardiography as the primary test does not appear to be justified on a cost-effective basis. In addition, the substantial minority of subjects with increased wall thickness made clinical interpretation of the echocardiographic findings difficult in individual athletes.\r"

After 1 year the patients had fewer clinical and radiologic signs of heart failure, but median end-diastolic volume index had increased from 92 to 112 ml/m2 (p less than 0.001), median end-systolic volume index from 51 to 65 ml/m2 (p less than 0.001) and median stroke volume index from 39 to 47 ml/m2 (p less than 0.001). Patients with first anterior infarcts had significantly greater increases in end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index and stroke volume index than patients with first inferoposterior infarcts. The increase in LV volumes was significantly greater in patients with clinical manifestations of heart failure than in those without these signs.

The location of the infarction was inferior in 4, anterior in 3 and lateral in 1. Four patients had a history of prior myocardial infarction. Two patients were in cardiac arrest; the remaining 6 had a mean blood pressure of 43 to 55 mm Hg before the bypass. Five had pulmonary capillary Wedge pressure greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg. One patient, with a right ventricular infarction, had a pulmonary wedge pressure of 10 mm Hg. Percutaneous insertion of 20Fr cannulas was carried out. Flow rates of 3.2 to 5.2 liters/min were achieved. Two patients in cardiac arrest regained consciousness while still in ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Left ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 17 to 40% (mean 32). One patient had left main, 4 had multivessel, and 4 had 1-vessel coronary disease. Seven patients had successful angioplasty of 15 of 16 lesions attempted, with all infarct-related vessels successfully dilated. One patient had lesions unsuitable for either bypass or angioplasty and died. Need for blood transfusion was the most frequent complication. One patient required surgical repair of the femoral artery. All 7 patients are alive at a mean follow-up of 8.2 months. It is concluded that cardiopulmonary bypass can be safely instituted percutaneously, hemodynamically stabilize patients in cardiogenic shock and facilitate emergency complex coronary angioplasty, which may be life-saving.\r"

  ".W": "To establish whether plasma vitamin measurements made after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can be used in case-control studies of coronary artery disease, the short-term effect of AMI on plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, beta-carotene, vitamin E and retinol was investigated. Sequential measures of these vitamins were made during the first 48 hours after AMI in 13 patients admitted to the hospital within 4 hours after the onset of symptoms. Plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D did not change significantly during the first 12 hours after onset of symptoms. Beta-carotene levels increased significantly (p less than 0.05) during the first 12 hours and then decreased, whereas levels of vitamin E and retinol progressively decreased during the first 48 hours by 26 and 25%, respectively. These results suggest that, of these vitamins, only plasma measurements of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 collected within 12 hours of onset of symptoms may provide reliable information for case-control studies of AMI.\r"

As DO2 declined due to low cardiac output, a significant decrease in VO2 (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001) and a significant increase in P50 (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001) were observed. In the DO2 range between 300 and 450 ml/min/m2, in which the DO2 of 32 survivors and 11 nonsurvivors overlapped, the P50 of nonsurvivors was significantly higher than that of survivors (31.5 +/- 1.6 vs 27.9 +/- 1.5 torr, p less than 0.001), but there were no significant differences in any other oxygen transport variable. As a result of differences in P50, VO2 in this range was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared to survivors (169 +/- 17 vs 148 +/- 13 ml/min/m2, p less than 0.001). These data suggest that a normal or increased VO2 alone does not ensure survival in patients with acute myocardial infarction, and increased P50 leads to an increase in VO2. Nevertheless, the interpretation of an increased P50 in patients with acute myocardial infarction must be made with caution, even with adequate DO2 and VO2, because it may imply a precarious oxygen transport/requirement balance in peripheral tissue and, hence, a fatal outcome.\r"

Patients were identified with demonstrated intimal dissections (intimal contrast staining or frank intimal flap) at the time of initial PTCA who returned a mean of 17.5 weeks (range 9 to 50) later with recurrent chest pain. Repeat angiography revealed luminal compromise due to dissection rather than restenosis in 22 patients. Of these, 17 underwent repeat PTCA. Elective bypass surgery without attempted PTCA was chosen in the other 5 patients because of extensive intimal dissections (greater than 2 balloon lengths) or involvement of critical branches. In the group of 17 patients who had repeat PTCA, 10 (group 1) had a frank intimal flap without persistent contrast staining after the initial PTCA, while 7 (group 2) had both persistent staining and a flap. Successful PTCA was performed in 13 of these 17 patients (76%). There were 2 abrupt closures and 2 unsatisfactory luminal openings. One of these patients required urgent coronary bypass surgery. All 10 group 1 patients had successful repeat procedures versus only 3 of 7 group 2 patients (p = 0.01). The 3 patients with the greatest degree of luminal compromise immediately after the initial PTCA had failed repeat PTCA attempts. These results suggest that repeat PTCA for subacute intimal dissections presenting as restenosis can be successfully performed in selected patients, and that the presence of contrast staining and the degree of luminal compromise by the dissection may be predictive of outcome.\r"

A history of previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension or peripheral vascular disease at the time of pacing was not associated with an increased frequency of subsequent cardiac events. Six of 38 patients with later cardiac events had a history of congestive heart failure, compared with 8 of 157 without cardiac events (p less than 0.05). Neither pacing-induced angina, ST depression, nor the presence of a fixed perfusion defect was significantly more frequent in patients with cardiac events as a whole compared with patients without such events.

In this study, the incidence and natural course of this anomaly were prospectively evaluated in 3,500 children referred for echocardiographic examination. ASA was found in 35 patients, 19 female and 16 male (1.0%). Patients were 6 years of age or younger at the time of diagnosis and 18 were neonates. None of the 750 children with normal echocardiograms had ASA. The most common associated lesion was atrial septal defect (ASD), which occurred in 24 of the 35 patients (69%). Other associated cardiac lesions were ventricular septal defect in 10, pulmonary stenosis in 5, patient ductus arteriosus in 4 and coarctation or interruption of the aorta with subaortic membrane in 2. No clinical complications were associated with ASA. Six patients with complex heart disease died. When associated with ASD, the direction of the ASA motion and that of the shunt found by Doppler echocardiography were similar. Fourteen patients with ASD were followed for 0.5 to 4 years. In 8 the ASD closed and in 6 the ASA disappeared. In 6 patients the ASD and ASA persisted until the end of the follow-up (p less than 0.01). Thus, the incidence of ASA in children in this series was higher than previously presumed and usually was associated with other cardiac anomalies, mainly ASD. In children, ASA tends to disappear with age and may have a role in spontaneous closure of associated ASD.\r"

  ".W": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine derivative belonging to the group of pharmacologic calcium entry blocking agents and is characterized as having a slow onset and relatively long duration of action with minimal effects on cardiac electrophysiology and myocardial contractility. The protective effect of amlodipine was studied in isolated blood-perfused feline hearts made globally ischemic for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion for 60 minutes. Ischemic-induced alterations of left ventricular developed pressure and complicance were monitored. In 11 control and 7 drug-treated hearts, amlodipine produced significant decreases in myocardial oxygen consumption (6.2 +/- 0.4 to 4.4 +/- 0.4 ml oxygen/min/100 g) and coronary vascular resistance, as assessed by changes in perfusion pressure (120 +/- 1 to 100 +/- 4 mm Hg). Amlodipine administered before the onset of global ischemia decreased the development of ischemic contracture as reflected by a progressive increase in resting left ventricular diastolic pressure. The return of contractile function, 60 minutes afer reperfusion, improved significantly in the amlodipine-treated group compared with controls, and there was better maintenance of the tissue concentration of Na+, Ca2+ and K+. A canine model of regional myocardial ischemia (90 minutes) followed by 6 hours of reperfusion was used to assess the cardioprotective effects of amlodipine, 150 micrograms/kg, administered 15 minutes before reperfusion. Infarct size, expressed as a percentage of the area at risk, was smaller in the amlodipine-treated group (n = 10) than in the control group (n = 10) (34.5 +/- 3.8% vs 45.9 +/- 2.8%, p = 0.027). Risk region size did not differ between groups and both groups were comparable with respect to the hemodynamic parameters of heart rate, blood pressure and rate-pressure product. Amlodipine prevented the gradual reduction in coronary blood flow observed in the control group. It is concluded that amlodipine reduces myocardial ischemic injury by mechanism(s) that may involve a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand as well as by positively influencing transmembrane Ca2+ fluxes during ischemia and reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, attention has focused on the effects of calcium antagonists on renal function. When administered in vitro to the isolated perfused kidney, calcium antagonists exhibit consistent actions permitting characterization of their renal effects. Calcium antagonists do not affect the vasodilated isolated perfused kidney, but they do dramatically alter the response of the kidney to vasoconstrictor agents. This study examined the effects of the novel dihydropyridine amlodipine on the hemodynamic response of the isolated perfused kidney to angiotensin II. Amlodipine completely reversed the angiotensin II-induced decrement in glomerular filtration rate of this model (0.72 +/- 0.15, 0.26 +/- 0.10 and 0.73 +/- 0.12 ml/min/g for control, angiotensin II and angiotensin II plus 0.1 microM amlodipine respectively). In contrast, amlodipine only partially restored renal perfusate flow (35.8 +/- 2.7, 14.7 +/- 1.9 and 23.7 +/- 2.5 ml/min/g for control, angiotensin II and angiotensin II plus amlodipine), thereby increasing filtration fraction. These findings are consistent with previous observations from this laboratory indicating that dihydropyridines predominantly vasodilate preglomerular renal resistance vessels and through this mechanism exert a preferential augmentation of glomerular filtration rate.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a new 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative amlodipine have been compared with results from our previous work. Application of amlodipine at a concentration of 1.6 X 10(-6) M to isolated guinea-pig papillary muscle for 120 minutes produced a 50% reduction in tension development compared with a concentration of 3.7 X 10(-7) M nifedipine needed to produce the same result under identical conditions. This suggests that amlodipine has even weaker negative inotropic effects than nifedipine. In isolated porcine coronary strips, the K+-induced contractions were approximately 10,000 times more sensitive to the relaxing effects of nisoldipine, nitrendipine and nicardipine than to those of papaverine, whereas nifedipine and amlodipine were 3,000 times more potent than papaverine. However, in comparison with these in vitro actions, the efficacy of amlodipine appears to be greater in vivo: Simultaneous subcutaneous injection of nifedipine (20 mg/kg) and of equimolar doses of nisoldipine and felodipine attenuated the myocardial calcium uptake by rat hearts in situ (stimulated with a single subcutaneous dose of 30 mg/kg isoproterenol) with the same efficacy, whereas the actions of nitrendipine and nimodipine were considerably weaker. In contrast, amlodipine antagonized isoproterenol-stimulated myocardial calcium accumulation more effectively. Furthermore, amlodipine exhibited a high antihypertensive potency combined with rapid onset and long duration of action: Amlodipine (10 mg/kg orally [p.o.]) reduced the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats almost to the same extent as nifedipine, nitrendipine, verapamil and felodipine administered at the much higher doses of 100 mg/kg p.o. Amlodipine (20 mg/kg/day p.o.) maintained normal blood pressure during the whole life span of Dahl-S rats (5 months), but this dose is considerably lower than that reported for other 1,4-dihydropyridines. The survival of NaCl-loaded Dahl-S rats increased from 20 to 100% after administration of amlodipine (20 mg/kg/day p.o.) over 10 weeks: The effective dose of other calcium antagonists is approximately 5 times higher, but well tolerated as, e.g., demonstrated in long-term studies on Dahl-S rats with nitrendipine over 12 months. Increases in systemic arteriolar tone can be visualized in the ocular fundus of spontaneously hypertensive rats. After amlodipine (10 mg/kg p.o.) arteriolar spasm declines. Prophylaxis with 2 doses of 20 mg/kg amlodipine daily in NaCl-loaded Dahl-S rats abolished the macroscopic and histologic changes that are normally seen in branches of the mesenteric artery. With use of electron microscopy, calcium accumulation in the lamina elastica interna was demonstrated by the potassium-pyr-oantimonate technique.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The degree of ionization of the drug molecule was found to affect both the development of and the recovery from block of L-type calcium channels. Under alkaline conditions, when most of the drug is in a neutral form, the actions of amlodipine resemble previously described neutral dihydropyridine (DHP) compounds. Under these conditions, calcium channel block by amlodipine is reversibly regulated by cell membrane potential, i.e., block is more pronounced at voltages positive to -50 mV and completely relieved at voltages negative to -80 mV. When the drug molecule is ionized, block develops very slowly at positive membrane potentials and is very difficult to relieve on returning the membrane potential to more negative voltages. It is concluded that the degree of ionization of the drug molecule limits access to the DHP receptor and that the drug-bound receptor can be titrated by extracellular hydrogen ions. These results place limitations on the location of the DHP receptor within the cardiac sarcolemmal membrane.\r"

As niguldipine is a very hydrophobic compound, it (1) readily adsorbs to surfaces of the plastic-ware often used in radioligand binding assays and (2) partitions into the hydrophobic membrane compartments. Both phenomena decrease the actual free drug concentration in radioligand-binding assays and lead to gross underestimation of the affinity of niguldipine (and other hydrophobic ligands) for the 1,4-dihydropyridine binding domain of the L-type Ca2+ channel or for alpha 1A adrenoceptors, respectively. Partitioning of the hydrophobic molecules into the membrane phase leads to a dependence of the Ki value on \"total receptor\" concentration despite mathematic corrections of the experimentally determined IC50 values. The Ki dependence was mimicked by adding denatured membranes (devoid of high-affinity receptor-binding activity) to native membrane preparations. Loss to pipet tips and tubes was avoided by a special dilution protocol. Partitioning into the hydrophobic membrane compartments needed more elaborate correction procedures.\r"

Amlodipine was given intravenously, 0.25 mg/kg, 5 hours before excising the hearts. Ischemia (global) was induced at 37 degrees C for 10, 30 or 60 minutes, and was followed by reperfusion. Protection was quantitated in terms of functional recovery, adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate retention, tissue acidosis and Ca2+ gain. The results show that amlodipine pretreatment supplied protection, provided that the ischemic episode did not exceed 30 minutes. The protection resulted in improved recovery of peak developed tension on reperfusion, reduced Ca2+ gain, retention of tissue adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate, and reduced acidosis.\r"

Hemodynamic and electrophysiologic parameters were measured before and up to 3 hours after amlodipine. Coronary blood flow was significantly increased 10 and 30 minutes after drug administration, whereas cardiac output and mean arterial pressure were unaffected. Coronary vascular resistance was decreased but total systemic vascular resistance did not change. Atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction was slightly prolonged, as reflected by increases in atrial-His bundle and AV conduction times and PR interval, 30 minutes after administration. All parameters returned toward their control values within 3 hours after drug administration. Comparison of coronary vascular resistance and AV conduction changes with those previously reported for other calcium channel blocking drugs where autonomic blockade existed suggests that at equivalent levels of coronary vasodilation, amlodipine's effects more closely resemble the effects of diltiazem or verapamil than other dihydropyridines.\r"

Acute coronary occlusion (3 minutes) significantly lengthened time to onset, time to peak and duration of bipolar electrograms recorded from both subendocardial and subepicardial left ventricular sites. After intravenous injection of amlodipine (0.3 mg/kg, n = 6), subsequent periods of ischemia greatly reduced (p less than 0.01) all indexes of subepicardial conduction delay. In the subendocardium, amlodipine decreased only time to onset (-25 +/- 4%, p less than 0.01) within the ischemic zone. Significant delays in all indexes were present during repeated ischemic periods in the placebo-treated control group (n = 5). Amlodipine also increased regional myocardial blood flow within the nonischemic myocardium by 25 +/- 10% and decreased mean aortic pressure by 7 +/- 2% without altering flow in the ischemic region. Left atrial pressure remained unchanged. Indexes of ischemia-induced conduction delay were more rapidly restored after reperfusion in amlodipine-pretreated than in control animals. In conclusion, amlodipine produced a beneficial blood flow-independent effect on ischemia-induced injury potentials. The effect may help to reduce the likelihood of development of lethal ventricular arrhythmias in the early stage of myocardial ischemia in the clinical setting.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of amlodipine (0.3 mg/kg administered intravenously, n = 5) and placebo (n = 5) on recovery of myocardial function and respiration of isolated mitochondria were examined in \"stunned\" myocardium of normotensive pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Measures of myocardial wall motion, using sonomicrometers, and tissue blood flow, by radioactive microspheres, were obtained at baseline, 15 minutes after administration of amlodipine or placebo, after 10 minutes of left circumflex artery ligation and at 60 minutes of reperfusion. Mean aortic pressure decreased from 115 +/- 6 to 101 +/- 5 mm Hg after administration of amlodipine and remained decreased throughout the experiment. Heart rate was not significantly affected at any time. Both groups showed similar degrees of ischemia: elevation of ST segment to 4.7 +/- 1.4 vs 6.2 +/- 1.9 mV; reduction of ischemic zone shortening fraction to 0.6 +/- 1.9 vs -3.4 +/- 2.7%; and reduction of epicardial and endocardial blood flows (epicardial = 40 +/- 13 vs 43 +/- 13 ml/100 g/min; endocardial = 7 +/- 4 vs 13 +/- 6 ml/100 g/min [values for amlodipine vs placebo]). Mitochondrial state 3 rate of respiration and respiratory control index indicative of rate of adenosine triphosphate synthesis and membrane integrity in myocardial samples taken after 10 minutes of ischemia were significantly reduced in the placebo but not in the amlodipine group. Myocardial function showed significantly greater improvement in amlodipine vs placebo at 60 minutes of reperfusion as indicated by shortening fraction (17.7 +/- -1.4 vs 5.8 +/- -3.5%, amlodipine vs placebo), which may have been related to increased myocardial blood flow and decreased blood pressure during reperfusion. Thus, amlodipine pretreatment prevented mitochondrial dysfunction during ischemia and accelerated recovery of both myocardial mechanical function and blood flow when compared with placebo.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the clinical and pathologic features of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in cardiac transplant recipients, 22 Stanford patients who had 25 documented infarcts at a mean of 3.86 years after transplantation were reviewed. Symptoms included chest pain (2), arm pain (3), weakness (16), dyspnea (11) and palpitations (8). Three episodes were clinically silent, detected only as new electrocardiographic changes during routine follow-up. Of 18 patients hospitalized with symptoms, only 7 had electrocardiographic changes of typical Q-wave AMI; 5 had nonspecific ST-segment changes and 2 had no documented changes. Two had old Q waves. Twelve of the 18 were misdiagnosed at admission as having infection or congestive heart failure. Serial creatine phosphokinase levels were obtained in 13 patients, and values were elevated in 8. Six of 25 AMI episodes were associated with development of congestive heart failure and 4 others led to development of cardiogenic shock. Seven patients died during the acute phase of infarction, 12 were retransplanted from 2 days to 6 months after infarct and 1 died suddenly after discharge. Two healed myocardial infarctions of unknown duration were found at autopsy or on explantation in patients not clinically suspected of having an AMI. All infarcts occurred in patients known to have angiographic evidence of transplant coronary artery disease, based on annual coronary arteriography. At autopsy or explantation all hearts were found to have characteristic diffuse concentric coronary artery narrowing, and 4 (18%) had an unusual pattern of multiple foci of nontransmural AMI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
