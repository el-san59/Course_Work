  ".W": "Parallel wire stents were implanted over exchange guide wires at percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty sites in 27 canine coronary arteries that were predilated with slightly oversized balloons. Stents were stainless steel, self-expandable, 3.5 to 4.5 mm in diameter, 9 to 12 mm in length, and were made of 10 wires that were longitudinally laser-welded in a zig-zag design. The compressible stent was delivered by the withdrawal of a Teflon outer catheter (4.2 to 4.9F) and the push of a polyethylene inner catheter. Aspirin, 80 mg per day, was given from the day before the study began, and heparin (150 U/kg) was administered during implantation. Quantitative angiography and pathologic examinations were performed at day 0 and at weeks 2, 4, 12, 26 and 52. The coronary angiographic diameter at the stent site immediately after stenting marginally increased from diameter before stenting: 3.22 +/- 0.40 mm versus 3.14 +/- 0.37 mm (p = 0.03), and during a mean of 14 weeks of follow-up, remained unaltered from immediate post-stenting: 3.29 +/- 0.43 mm versus 3.22 +/- 0.40 mm (p = NS) with no stent displacement. Comparisons of patency and thrombosis between heparin-coated and uncoated stents, between left anterior descending and circumflex arteries, and among the three different diameters of stents showed uniformly good results. At microscopy, the wires were oriented perfectly and embedded in the arterial wall, and by 2 weeks they were covered by mucopolysaccharide ground substance, smooth muscle cells, and an almost complete monolayer of neoendothelial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A dual-laser system (helium-cadmium and pulsed dye) capable of continuous computer analysis of spectroscopic characteristics of tissue fluorescence, which can distinguish atherosclerotic plaque from components of normal arterial wall, was used to deliver laser energy to ablate plaque. During a 1-year period this system was used to facilitate balloon angioplasty of short (3 to 17 cm) total occlusions of the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries only when standard angioplasty techniques were ineffective. During the year of the study, in one institution 415 patients were subjected to arteriography of the lower extremities for leg ischemia (397 for limb salvage indications). Standard angioplasty techniques were used in 94 of these patients; 218 patients were unsuitable for standard angioplasty, did not fulfill criteria for \"smart\" laser treatment, and underwent standard bypass operations. Only 11 patients (plus six others in the second institution) requiring treatment fulfilled the criteria for use of the \"smart\" laser. In 10 patients the occluding lesion was traversed by the laser wire (diameter 0.021 inch), and luminal patency was effectively restored by balloon angioplasty to greater than or equal to 70% of the most normal-appearing segment of that artery. Satisfactory luminal patency has persisted for 2 to 12 months (mean 6 months) in nine patients; the lesion in the tenth patient restenosed at 3 months. The laser procedure was unsuccessful in all three patients with occlusions greater than 10 cm and in four others. Although there were three microperforations with the laser wire, there were no clinically significant complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine its frequency and identify clinical features that make the bedside diagnosis likely, 82 patients admitted for decompensated heart failure were classified into 2 groups based on their LV systolic performance, as defined by fractional shortening (FS): group I (n = 59), with impaired systolic function (fractional shortening less than 24%), and group II (n = 23) with preserved systolic function (fractional shortening greater than or equal to 24%). Mean fractional shortening was 15 +/- 5% and 39 +/- 1% for groups I and II, respectively. Female gender (p less than 0.05), obesity (p less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) predominated in group II. Jugular venous distention was identified more frequently in group I (p less than 0.05). No statistically significant difference between the 2 groups was noted among various demographic variables (age, duration of symptoms, history of hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heavy alcohol drinking) or physical findings (S3 gallop, edema, cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion and pulmonary edema). Echocardiographic mean left ventricular dimension measured 6.6 +/- 1 versus 5.0 +/- 1 cm (p less than 0.01) and mean posterior wall thickness 1.1 +/- 0.3 versus 1.4 +/- 0.4 cm (p less than 0.01) in group I and II, respectively. The combination of diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg and an absence of jugular venous distention had a high specificity and positive predictive value (100%) for identifying group II patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Adequate echocardiographic and Doppler examinations were obtained in 498 patients or 98% of the population. Clinical data were available for analysis in 497 patients. In 160 patients, Doppler demonstrated an aortic valve area less than or equal to 0.75 cm2 or a peak jet velocity greater than or equal to 4.5 m/s consistent with critical AS. In the subgroup with cardiac catheterization (n = 105), Doppler was 97% accurate. Aortic valve replacement or balloon valvuloplasty was performed in 109 patients, 106 of whom were symptomatic. Noncritical AS was detected by Doppler in 327 patients, with 95% accuracy in the subgroup with cardiac catheterization (n = 133). Aortic valve replacement was performed in 15 patients with symptoms of AS and with valve areas assessed by Doppler to be between 0.76 and 0.80 cm2 or with peak jet velocities greater than 3.5 m/s. In 20 patients, aortic valve replacement was performed because of moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, and in 11 elderly (greater than 70 years old) patients with valve areas between 0.80 and 1.0 cm2, valve replacement was performed at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery in an attempt to prevent the need for a repeat surgical procedure in the future. These observations allow the following conclusions. In the symptomatic patient with critical or near critical AS by Doppler, cardiac catheterization does not provide additional information beyond that provided by Doppler.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study assessed the variability between 2 echocardiography centers concerning 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic results in the quantification of mitral and aortic valve stenoses. Forty-two patients were studied by 2 different echocardiography centers in a blinded, independent fashion. In patients with aortic and mitral valve stenosis, mean and maximal flow velocities were measured. The aortic valve orifice area was calculated according to the continuity equation. Mitral valve orifice area was determined by direct planimetry and by pressure half-time. In patients with an aortic valve stenosis, a close relation between the 2 centers was found for the maximal and mean flow velocities (coefficient of correlation, r = 0.72 to 0.92; coefficient of variation, 3.7 to 7.7%). A close correlation and a small observer variability was found for the flow velocity ratio determined by flow velocities measured in the left ventricular outflow tract and over the stenotic valve (r = 0.88; coefficient of variation, 0.01 +/- 0.009). In contrast, there was a poor correlation between the diameter of the left ventricular outflow tract and the aortic orifice area (r = 0.36 and 0.59, respectively). In patients with a mitral valve stenosis, mean and maximal velocities were closely correlated (r = 0.85 and 0.77, respectively). Velocities were not found to be significantly different between the 2 centers. Variability between the 2 centers for the mitral valve orifice area was 9.8% (2-dimensional echocardiography) and 5.7% (pressure half-time).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Well-absorbed, with a lag time of 4.4 to 9.8 minutes, 5-hydroxypropafenone reached peak concentrations of 153 to 337 ng/ml after 20 to 51 minutes. The terminal half-life was 506 to 963 minutes. To describe the temporal aspects of the concentration-effect relation, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model with a hypothetical effect compartment was applied. The relation between electrocardiographic changes and drug concentration at the effect site could be described by a linear regression model. Significant prolongations of PQ and QRS duration were found in 5 of 6 subjects. There were no changes in QTc interval, blood pressure measurements and heart rate in the supine position. However, blood pressure measurements in the upright position revealed a greater percent decrease of systolic blood pressure than with placebo (mean +/- standard deviation -25.6 +/- 13.8% vs -3.4 +/- 13.1%, p less than 0.05). It is concluded that 5-hydroxypropafenone exerts significant pharmacologic activity in humans as well as animals. Because QRS prolongation in patients treated with class IC antiarrhythmic drugs correlates with the antiarrhythmic effect, our data suggest that 5-hydroxypropafenone may contribute to the therapeutic activity of propafenone in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The prognostic value of radionuclide angiocardiography was examined in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Nine hundred and eight patients who underwent rest and exercise radionuclide angiocardiography without subsequent cardiac catheterization were followed for a median of 4.6 years. Fifty-two cardiovascular deaths and 28 nonfatal myocardial infarctions occurred during the follow-up period. Thirty-nine radionuclide angiocardiographic and clinical variables were analyzed in association with the end points of cardiovascular death, total cardiac events and death from all causes using the Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Univariable analysis identified the exercise ejection fraction as the best predictor of cardiovascular death (chi-square = 82), total cardiac events (chi-square = 84) and death from all causes (chi-square = 66). A small subset of patients (n = 45) with an exercise ejection fraction less than 0.35 were at high risk for future cardiac events, whereas most patients (n = 776) had an exercise ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 and a low probability of a subsequent event. Three variables--the exercise ejection fraction, the exercise change in heart rate, and gender--contained independent prognostic information determined by multivariable analysis. The exercise ejection fraction was the strongest independent predictor (p less than 0.0001) for every end point. The measurement of ventricular function during exercise provides important independent prognostic information in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Radionuclide angiocardiography successfully identifies patients requiring invasive assessment, and the low probability of cardiac events in patients with good exercise ventricular function obviates the need for interventional therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Circadian rhythms have been demonstrated in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and in other clinical cardiac dysfunctions. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether a circadian pattern of transient myocardial ischemia exists after first AMI. Prospectively, 24-hour ambulatory ST-segment monitoring was initiated at discharge on day 11 +/- 5 in 123 consecutive survivors of first AMI. A total of 93 ischemic episodes (91 asymptomatic) occurred in 21 of the 123 patients (17%) (mean duration of 30 minutes, range 4 to 292). A significant circadian rhythm of transient myocardial ischemia was found with a peak activity occurring in the evening hours (p less than 0.01). Thus, 43% of ischemic episodes and 42% of ischemic time occurred between 6 P.M. and 12 midnight. The characteristics of morning and evening episodes were similar, except for the heart rate at maximal ST-segment depression, which was significantly higher during morning episodes (p less than 0.02). Patients with transient myocardial ischemia had a diurnal distribution similar to the circadian variation displayed during ischemic activity. Thus, 16 of the 21 patients had ischemic episodes from 6 P.M. to 12 midnight versus 10 patients from 6 A.M. to 12 noon (p less than 0.01). The 24-hour mean minimal heart rate was significantly higher in patients with than without ischemic episodes (p less than 0.02). In conclusion, this study has established a significant circadian peak of transient myocardial ischemia in the evening hours in survivors of first AMI. Whether the pattern displayed is due to endogenous biologic functions or cyclic variations, or both, in the external environment needs to be clarified.\r"

These men provided details of parental history of MI, including their parents' age at the first event, their personal history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus, and a detailed dietary assessment completed at baseline. During 72,454 person-years of follow-up, 181 non-fatal MIs were documented, 49 men died from MI or sudden death, and 140 underwent coronary artery surgery or angioplasty. Compared with men without any history of parental MI, those whose mothers or fathers had had an MI at less than 70 years of age had a substantially elevated risk of MI (relative risk = 2.2, 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.8 for maternal history; relative risk = 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.3 for paternal history). Risk of MI increased with decreasing age at parental MI. Paternal but not maternal history of MI was related to increased risk of coronary artery surgery. These associations were not appreciably altered by controlling for diet or established risk factors, either individually or in multivariate models. These prospective data indicate that a history of MI in either parent is associated with an increased risk of CAD among men.\r"

Initial test performance was similar between groups. After aerobic training, the maximal load that could be lifted once only (1-repetition maximum) in single-arm curl, single-leg press and single-knee extension exercises increased by 13% (11.8 to 13.3 kg; p less than 0.01), 4% (97.0 to 101.0 kg; difference not significant) and 5% (28.2 to 29.7 kg; difference not significant), respectively; corresponding gains with combined weightlifting and aerobic training were 43% (12.2 to 17.4 kg; p less than 0.01), 21% (99.0 to 120.0 kg; p less than 0.01) and 24% (29.0 to 36.0 kg; p less than 0.01). After aerobic training, the initial 1-repetition maximum could be lifted an average of 4 times, compared with 14 times after combined training. Maximal progressive incremental cycle ergometer power output increased by 2% in the aerobic control group (1,088 to 1,113 kpm/min; difference not significant) and by 15% (1,030 to 1,180 kpm/min; p less than 0.05) in the experimental group. Cycling time at 80% of initial maximal power before attaining a Borg (0 to 10) rating of perceived exertion of 7 (very severe) increased by 11% (604 to 672 seconds; difference not significant) and by 109% (541 to 1,128 seconds; p less than 0.05) in the control and weight-trained patients, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

According to the questionnaire, the proportion of effort-induced anginal episodes ranged from 1 to 99%. The ischemic threshold during exercise testing ranged from 110 x 10(2) to 350 x 10(2) mm Hg x beats/min. At least 1 episode of ST-segment depression was observed in 29 of the 65 patients during Holter monitoring. Ischemic episodes during Holter monitoring were more frequent (p less than 0.05) in patients reporting greater than or equal to 50% of anginal attacks on effort, with moderate to severe limitation of exercise capacity and with multivessel coronary artery disease. The effect on ambulatory ischemia of a 6-week treatment with a beta blocker (metoprolol CR, 200 mg once daily) or a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (nifedipine retard 20 mg twice daily) were then compared according to a double-blind, parallel group design. Metoprolol significantly reduced the number and duration of the ischemic episodes during daily life (p less than 0.05) irrespective of the patients' clinical characteristics. Nifedipine was ineffective, particularly in patients with angina predominantly on effort and with a moderate to severe reduction in exercise tolerance. It is concluded that in patients with mixed angina, ischemic episodes during daily life are more likely to occur in patients with a clinical presentation suggesting poor coronary reserve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Variables associated with a poor long-term prognosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) include a short duration of symptoms before PTCA, unstable angina and the presence of thrombus at the PTCA site. These imply a component of transient or dynamic obstruction as opposed to a pure fixed obstruction. It is postulated that resolution pressure (i.e., the pressure at which complete balloon inflation occurs) may also correlate with prognosis after successful PTCA. In 173 consecutive patients undergoing successful, elective, single-lesion PTCA, 48 (28%) were found to have narrowings that resolved at less than or equal to 2 atm (group 1) and 125 (72%) were found to have narrowings resolved at greater than 2 atm (group 2). There were no significant differences in baseline, anatomic or procedural variables between the 2 groups, except that angiographic coronary dissection occurred in 17% of group 1 patients versus 40% of group 2 patients (p less than 0.007). During a mean follow-up of 12.0 +/- 6.1 months, the incidence of cardiac events (repeat PTCA, coronary artery bypass grafting or myocardial infarction) was 29% in group 1 versus 15% in group 2 (p less than 0.05). The overall incidence of angina was similar between the groups (25 vs 28%), but Canadian Cardiovascular Association class 4 angina occurred significantly more frequently in group 1 than group 2 (21 vs 8%) (p less than 0.04). These data suggest that a low resolution pressure is associated with a higher incidence of unstable angina and recurrent cardiac events during follow-up than higher resolution pressures.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effects of fenofibrate, a lipid-lowering medication, on patients with coronary artery disease, 191 minor coronary narrowings in 42 patients with coronary artery disease were analyzed by quantitative coronary angiography using computer-assisted contour detection. Computed parameters were percent diameter reduction and percent plaque area. A prospectively formed intervention group of 21 patients treated with special diet and fenofibrate (200 to 400 mg/day) was checked every 6 weeks with regard to risk factors. After a mean interval of 21 months, coronary angiography was repeated, using the same x-ray system and nearly identical projections. The intervention group was angiographically compared at follow-up with an untreated comparison group, also comprising 21 patients. Both groups had high initial serum cholesterol (mean 311 mg/dl) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (mean 235 mg/dl). Only among the treated patients did lipid levels change significantly: cholesterol, -19%; LDL cholesterol, -20%; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, +19%; and triglycerides, -30%. At angiographic follow-up, the changes in percent diameter reduction and percent plaque area correlated positively with the mean serum and LDL cholesterol levels of the intervention group. Significant differences were found in the change in percent plaque area between both groups. The intervention subgroup with angiographic regressions (11 patients) had significantly lower serum and LDL cholesterol levels than the intervention subgroup with angiographic progressions (10 patients). These results indicate the beneficial effect of fenofibrate on minor coronary narrowings. Because of its high reproducibility in measuring minor narrowings, quantitative coronary angiography proved to be a suitable method for angiographic follow-up.\r"

Exercise sessions occurred either at the patients' homes or at remote hospital sites and began an average of 25 or 14 weeks, respectively, after hospital dismissal. Monitoring centers provided experienced nurses to direct all exercise sessions. The transtelephonic monitoring equipment was reliable with only one instance of system failure observed. A broad spectrum of patients with coronary artery disease, including some classified at higher risk, participated in the program. Patients exercised with a variety of equipment (cycle ergometer, treadmill, arm ergometer, cross-country ski simulator, combination arm-leg cycle ergometer, rowing machine), for 30 to 50 minutes, 1 to 3 times each week. No medical emergencies occurred, although 18 specific problems were discovered that led to further evaluation or change in the medical program of specific patients. Transtelephonic monitoring of cardiac rehabilitation exercise sessions at home and at remote hospitals appears safe and is attractive because not all patients have access to supervised exercise programs; this exercise assessment helps to maximally use highly trained cardiac rehabilitation personnel.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to assess the accuracy of a new noninvasive frequency analysis method for predicting patients with inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) at electrophysiologic study and hence the risk of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms from 3 orthogonal bipolar surface leads were evaluated using a microcomputer-based frequency analysis system that performs analysis of conventional time-domain late potentials as well as incorporating a new technique for spectral analysis of relatively short, overlapping signal segments spanning the whole QRS complex. The spectral analysis technique measured abnormalities anywhere in the entire QRS complex and did so without dependence on any arbitrarily defined frequency, duration or amplitude cutoffs. The hallmark of arrhythmogenic abnormality was hypothesized to be frequent and abrupt changes in the frequency signature of the QRS wave front velocity as it propagates throughout the ventricle around areas of abnormal conduction, resulting in a high degree of spectral turbulence. One-hundred forty-two subjects were studied, including 71 totally normal control subjects (\"true negatives\"), 33 with both late potentials by time-domain analysis and inducible sustained monomorphic VT (\"true positives\"), 28 with late potentials but no evidence of spontaneous or inducible sustained monomorphic VT (\"false positives\") and 10 with inducible sustained monomorphic VT but absence of time-domain late potentials (\"false negatives\"). The frequency analysis technique correctly classified 100% of the true negatives, 97% of the true positives, 86% of the late potentials false positives and 60% of the late potentials false negatives. The total predictive accuracy of frequency analysis for all groups was 94%, compared with 73% for time-domain late potential analysis. The results suggest that a high degree of spectral turbulence of the overall QRS signal during sinus rhythm may provide a more accurate marker for the anatomic-electrophysiologic substrate of reentrant tachyarrhythmias than detection of late potentials in the terminal QRS region by either time- or frequency-domain analysis. Spectral turbulence analysis is applicable to patients irrespective of the QRS duration and the presence or absence of bundle branch block.\r"

  ".W": "Although variation in ventricular cycle length during Wenckebach-type second-degree atrioventricular block traditionally has been explained by the direction of incremental change in PR lengthening preceding the blocked complex, changing PP intervals can also affect Wenckebach periodicity. A generalized algebraic solution was derived to define changing ventricular cycle length as a function of both changing PP and changing incremental PR interval behavior in Wenckebach block. Based on this solution, the determinants of cycle-length variation were examined for 65 episodes of Wenckebach block detected by ambulatory electrocardiography in 51 patients. As previously demonstrated, only 20% (13 of 65) of Wenckebach episodes were characterized by the \"classic\" shortening of RR intervals; in contrast, ventricular cycle length increased in 57% (37 of 65) and remained constant in 23% (15 of 65) of cases. Algebraic analysis of these episodes revealed that the direction of ventricular cycle-length change preceding the blocked complex was primarily determined by the direction of change of incremental PR intervals in only 35% (23 of 65) of Wenckebach episodes; RR change was governed by the direction of change of preceding PP intervals in 34% (22 of 65) and by equal change of PP and incremental PR intervals in 31% (20 of 65) of these episodes. Both inverse and concordant relationships between changing RP and PR intervals were primarily determined by the direction of PP variation during in vivo Wenckebach block. These data confirm that classic Wenckebach block is less common than \"atypical\" Wenckebach periodicity and demonstrate that RR variation in Wenckebach block is governed by the changing PP interval as often as by the changing incremental PR interval.\r"

Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A1 and B were measured. Total cholesterol increased with propranolol (smokers vs nonsmokers, 8 vs 2%); increased for smokers and decreased for nonsmokers with atenolol (8 vs -3%), metoprolol (6 vs -1%) and pindolol (7 vs -6%); and decreased for both groups with celiprolol (-3 vs -10%). HDL cholesterol decreased with propranolol (smokers vs nonsmokers, -8 vs -18%), atenolol (-7 vs -2%) and metoprolol (-12 vs -1%); increased for smokers and decreased for nonsmokers with pindolol (11 vs -2%); and increased for both groups with celiprolol (5 vs 6%). Similar trends were observed with LDL cholesterol and the total/HDL cholesterol ratio. It is concluded that early noncardioselective beta blockers such as propranolol have significant dyslipidemic effects in both smokers and nonsmokers. Cardioselective drugs such as atenolol and metoprolol, or drugs with partial agonist activity such as pindolol, have variable effects. Celiprolol, a new, highly cardioselective beta 1 blocker with partial beta 2 agonist activity and vasodilatory properties, has favorable effects on lipids and minimizes the dyslipidemic effects associated with smoking.\r"

Whereas experimental and limited clinical evidence suggests impairment of baroreflex mechanisms as the etiology of these attenuated responses, an alternative mechanism would be an inability of patients with CHF to increase sympathetic neural outflow above markedly elevated baseline levels. Hemodynamic and sympathetic neural responses (peroneal microneurography) were therefore compared of normal subjects (n = 10) and patients with CHF (n = 10) during the non-baroreflex sympathoexcitatory stimulus of the cold pressor test. The cold pressor stimulus produced increases in arterial pressure and heart rate in both groups. During hand immersion in ice water, normal subjects demonstrated significant increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity expressed as burst frequency (20 +/- 2 to 28 +/- 3 bursts/min, p less than 0.01), total integrated nerve activity (224 +/- 41 to 342 +/- 62 U/min, p less than 0.05), and total activity corrected for accompanying changes in heart rate (375 +/- 81 to 538 +/- 118 U/100 heart beats, p less than 0.05). Similarly, despite elevated control levels of sympathetic activity, patients with CHF also demonstrated significant sympathoexcitatory responses to the cold pressor stimulus, with increases in muscle sympathetic nerve burst frequency (60 +/- 7 to 67 +/- 7 bursts/min, p less than 0.01) total integrated nerve activity (818 +/- 159 to 1,015 +/- 191 U, p less than 0.001), and total activity corrected for accompanying changes in heart rate (1,008 +/- 178 to 1,173 +/- 201 U/100 heart beats, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This variant has a lower pI and was found by screening analyses in 2/4,000 German subjects and in 4/1,200 Portuguese by using either double one-dimensional (D1-D) electrophoresis with isoelectric focusing (IEF) or hybrid isoelectric focusing in immobilized pH gradient (HIEF) as the final separation step. The Portuguese population sample was from the area where TTR Met 30-associated familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) prevails, and it was divided into (a) a group of 500 individuals belonging to FAP kindreds and (b) a group of 700 collected at random. HIEF showed two particular situations: (1) one case, from an FAP kindred, was simultaneously carrier of the Met 30 substitution and the acidic variant, and (2) one individual, from the randomly selected Portuguese sample, had only the acidic monomer. Comparative peptide mapping, by HPLC, of the acidic variant carriers and of normal TTR showed the presence of an abnormal tryptic peptide, not present in the normal TTR digests, with an asparagine-for-histidine substitution at position 90 explained by a single base change of adenine for cytosine in the histidine codon. This was confirmed at the DNA level by RFLP analyses of PCR-amplified material after digestion with SphI and BsmI. In all carriers of the Asn 90 substitution, no indicators were found for an association with traits characteristic for FAP.\r"

The degree of overlap of minisatellite loci detected by these two probes is shown to be negligible (approximately 1%), and the resulting DNA fingerprints are therefore derived from independent sets of hypervariable loci. The level of allelism and linkage between different hypervariable DNA fragments scored with these probes is also low, implying substantial statistical independence of DNA fragments. Variation between the DNA fingerprints of different individuals indicates that the probability of chance identity is very low (much less than 10(-7) per probe). Empirical observations and theoretical considerations both indicate that genetic heterogeneity between subpopulations is unlikely to affect substantially the statistical evaluation of DNA fingerprints, at least among Caucasians. In paternity analysis, the proportion of nonmaternal DNA fragments in a child which cannot be attributed to the alleged father is shown to be an efficient statistic for distinguishing fathers from nonfathers, even in the presence of minisatellite mutation. Band-sharing estimates between a claimed parent and a child can also distinguish paternity from nonpaternity, though with less efficiency than comparison of a trio of mother, child, and alleged father.\r"

At present, this approach is the best effort a forensic scientist can make to exclude an individual who has been falsely associated with an evidentiary sample found at a crime scene. When an analysis fails to exclude a suspect as a potential contributor of an evidentiary sample, a means should be provided to assess suitable weight to the putative match. Most important, the statistical analysis should not place undue weight on a genetic profile derived from an unknown sample that is attributed to an accused individual. The method must allow for limitations in conventional agarose-submarine-gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting procedure, limited sample population data, possible subpopulation differences, and potential sampling error. A conservative statistical method was developed based on arbitrarily defined fixed bins. This approach permits classification of continuous allelic data, provides for a simple and portable data-base system, and is unlikely to underestimate the frequency of occurrence of a set of alleles. This will help ensure that undue weight is not placed on a sample attributed to an accused individual.\r"

The pronuclear chromosomes were analyzed after in vitro penetration of golden hamster eggs. A total of 144 sperm were examined: 69.2% were chromosomally balanced and 30.8% were recombinant. Of the balanced complements, the proportion with a normal chromosome 3 (37.6%) was approximately equal to the proportion with an inverted 3 (31.6%). Of the recombinant complements, the proportion of sperm with a duplication q/deletion p (17.3%) was approximately equal to the reciprocal event of duplication p/deletion q (13.5%). The recombinant chromosome 3 with a duplication q and deletion p has been observed in several abnormal children, but the duplication p/deletion q has never been reported. My results demonstrate that both recombinant chromosomes are produced as expected from an unequal number of crossovers within an inversion loop. In all likelihood the duplication p/deletion q chromosome is an early embryonic lethal because of the amount of genetic material deleted. The proportions of X-bearing (48.9%) and Y-bearing sperm (51.1%) were not significantly different from the expected 1:1 ratio. There was no evidence for an interchromosomal effect. Of the three inversions studied by human sperm chromosome analysis, recombinant chromosomes have been observed only in this case.\r"

The gene is generally inactivated because of loss-of-function mutations, although epigenetic phenomena, such as hypermethylation of the promoter region, could possibly have the same effect. We investigated the methylation pattern at the 5' end of the retinoblastoma gene, including its promoter region and exon 1, in DNA purified from 56 primary retinoblastomas. We found five tumors with evidence for hypermethylation, all from unilateral, simplex patients. No methylation abnormalities were detected in DNA purified from the leukocytes from these patients. It is interesting that in one of these tumors the hypermethylation was confined to one allele. There were no mutations in a 1,306-bp sequence including the hypermethylated region that might account for the allele-specific hypermethylation. We believe that the hypermethylation of the retinoblastoma gene that we found in these tumors corresponds to the allelic inactivation of the gene, and we speculate that erroneous hypermethylation without alteration of nucleotide sequence occasionally plays a role in the genesis of this cancer. If this is true, then retinoblastomas with hypermethylation might be treatable with chemotherapeutic agents that interfere with methylation of DNA.\r"

The 20 linked markers form a continuous linkage group of 152 cM in males and 202 cM in females. Likely genetic locations are provided for 25 polymorphic anonymous sequences and 28 gene-specific RFLPs. The map was constructed employing the LINKAGE and CRIMAP computational methodologies to build the multipoint map via a stepwise algorithm. A detailed 10-point map of the 4p16 region constructed from the CEPH panel provides evidence for heterogeneity in the linkage maps constructed from families segregating for Huntington disease (HD). It additionally provides evidence for position-specific recombination frequencies in the telomeric region of 4p.\r"

The analysis of such association studies raises some specific problems because of the fact that genotypic and not gametic data are generally available. We present a log-linear-model analysis providing a valid method for analyzing such studies. When studying the association of disease with one marker locus, the log-linear model allows one to test for the difference between allelic frequencies among affected and unaffected individuals, Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) equilibrium in both groups, and interaction between the association of alleles at the marker locus and disease. This interaction provides information about the dominance of the disease susceptibility locus, with dominance defined using the epidemiological notion of odds ratio. The degree of dominance measured at the marker locus depends on the strength of linkage disequilibrium between the marker locus and the disease locus. When studying the association of disease with several linked markers, the model becomes rapidly complex and uninterpretable unless it is assumed that affected and unaffected populations are in H-W equilibrium at each locus. This hypothesis must be tested before going ahead in the analysis. If it is not rejected, the log-linear model offers a stepwise method of identification of the parameters causing the difference between populations. This model can be extended to any number of loci, alleles, or populations.\r"

  ".W": "A large Queensland family has an extreme form of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in which several neurological abnormalities and an infantile encephalopathy are present in addition to the characteristic ophthalmological changes. Sequence analysis of the seven mitochondrial genes encoding subunits of respiratory chain complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) reveals two novel features of the etiology of this mitochondrial genetic disease. The first conclusion from these studies is that the ophthalmological and neurological deficits in this family are produced by a mutation at nucleotide 4160 of the ND1 gene. This nucleotide alteration results in the substitution of proline for the highly conserved leucine residue at position 285 of the ND1 protein. Secondary-structure analysis predicts that the proline replacement disrupts a small alpha helix in a hydrophilic loop. All nine family members analyzed were homoplasmic for this mutation. The second major result from these studies is that the members of one branch of this family carry, at nucleotide 4136 of the same gene, a second mutation, also homoplasmic, which produces a cysteine-for-tyrosine replacement at position 277. The clinical and biochemical phenotypes of the family members indicate that this second nucleotide substitution may function as an intragenic suppressor mutation which ameliorates the neurological abnormalities and complex I deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "The debrisoquine/sparteine polymorphism is associated with a clinically important genetic deficiency of oxidative drug metabolism. From 5% to 10% of Caucasians designated as poor metabolizers (PMs) of the debrisoquine/sparteine polymorphism have a severely impaired capacity to metabolize more than 25 therapeutically used drugs. The impaired drug metabolism in PMs is due to the absence of cytochrome P450IID6 protein. The gene controlling the P450IID6 protein, CYP2D6, is located on the long arm of chromosome 22. A pseudogene CYP2D8P and a related gene CYP2D7 are located upstream from CYP2D6. This gene locus is highly polymorphic. After digestion of genomic DNA with XbaI endonuclease, restriction fragments of 11.5 kb and 44 kb represent mutant alleles of the cytochrome CYP2D6 gene locus associated with the PM phenotype. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the mutant allele reflected by the XbaI 11.5-kb fragment, a genomic library was constructed from leukocyte DNA of one individual homozygous for this fragment and screened with the human IID6 cDNA. The CYP2D genes were isolated and characterized by restriction mapping and partial sequencing. We demonstrate that the mutant 11.5-kb allele results from a deletion involving the entire functional CYP2D6 gene. This result provides an explanation for the total absence of P450IID6 protein in the liver of these PMs.\r"

Two similar candidate WT cDNA clones (WT33 and LK15) have recently been identified on the basis of both their expression in fetal kidney and their location within the smallest region of overlap of somatic 11p13 deletions in some tumors. These homozygous deletions, however, are large and potentially affect more than one gene. Using a cDNA probe to the candidate gene, we have analyzed DNA from both normal and tumor tissue from WT patients, in an effort to detect rearrangements at this locus. We report here a patient with bilateral WT who is heterozygous for a small (less than 11 kb) germinal deletion within this candidate gene. DNA from both tumors is homozygous for this intragenic deletion allele, which, by RNA-PRC sequence analysis, is predicted to encode a protein truncated by 180 amino acids. These data support the identification of this locus as an 11p13 WT gene (WT1) and provide direct molecular data supporting the two-hit mutational model for WT.\r"

Although zidovudine has no significant effect on the regression of these lesions, it does have antiviral activity in these patients as manifested by a decline in serum HIV antigen. However, when used separately, the two drugs can have serious side effects in some patients. In addition, the development of zidovudine-resistant strains has been noted in patients with advanced HIV disease receiving zidovudine for nine months or longer. Three in vivo trials have been initiated to assess possible advantages of combination therapy with zidovudine and interferon alfa in patients with AIDS-related KS. The incidence of serious adverse reactions, therapeutic efficacy, and the rate of emergence of zidovudine-resistant strains of HIV were evaluated. Preliminary results indicate that combination therapy with interferon alfa and zidovudine can safely be administered to patients with AIDS-related KS in doses that elicit antitumor and antiviral responses and discourage the potential emergence of zidovudine-resistant HIV strains.\r"

However, quantitative virologic studies performed to date on the blood of patients receiving recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) demonstrated no efficacy in vivo despite good drug levels in serum. These results led us to examine the neutralizing activity of sCD4 against multiple primary HIV-1 isolates from infected patients.

Environmental and age-related factors believed to contribute to ISH include obesity, declining physical activity, stress, and such dietary changes as increased salt intake and decreased intake of calcium and potassium. Increased rigidity of the aorta resulting in reduced compliance is an important hemodynamic feature, but factors that increase peripheral resistance also appear to play a role. Antihypertensive drugs have been shown to effectively and safely lower the systolic blood pressure elevations characteristic of ISH. To date, use of low drug doses and careful titration of dosage have avoided significant orthostatic hypotension and undue lowering of the diastolic pressure. Studies of relatively small groups of patients suggest that antihypertensive drugs can lower the risk of cardiovascular morbidity/mortality associated with ISH but the definitive answer awaits results of the ongoing large-scale Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program trial. In the interim, management should begin with conservative measures such as weight loss, salt restriction and, possibly, calcium supplementation. If this fails, drug therapy should be considered in patients with systolic blood pressures above 180 mm Hg and in those with systolic readings between 160 and 180 mm Hg who have concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. To date, no controlled trials of sufficient size have demonstrated that one drug class is more effective than another in treating ISH. Drug therapy should be tailored to the individual patient, starting with a low dose of a single drug and, if necessary, slowly increasing dosage until a systolic blood pressure under 160 mm Hg is attained.\r"

  ".W": "The aging kidney undergoes hemodynamic changes characterized by reductions in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. These functional changes are associated with loss of renal mass related to changes in the intrarenal vasculature. The reduced glomerular filtration surface area and subsequent microcirculatory adaptations enhance the risk for development of renal diseases associated with systemic diseases. Hypertensive nephrosclerosis accounts for 26% of all end-stage renal disease in the United States; the median age of those affected is 67 years. Hemodynamic and structural changes observed in the essential hypertensive kidney suggest an accentuation of the physiologic aging process. Initially observed hemodynamic changes, which may be reversible with specific drug therapy, suggest that excessive production of angiotensin II plays a role. Progressive renal impairment may occur despite control of systemic hypertension. Renal protection appears to require therapeutic normalization of both systemic and glomerular capillary pressures. The latter may depend on a drug's ability to attenuate the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II on the renal microcirculation. Drug classes with renal protective potential include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists. However, long-term clinical trials are required to assess the potential advantages of specific drug therapies in preventing the development and/or progression of hypertensive arteriolar nephrosclerosis.\r"

Older patients are both at higher risk for end-organ complications and less likely than younger ones to survive such complications as myocardial infarction and stroke. Clinical studies have shown that reduction of elevated blood pressure is beneficial in many older persons. Optimal selection of antihypertensive therapy requires consideration of the special characteristics of the elderly, who differ from their younger counterparts in physiology, response to therapy and frequency of concomitant illnesses and medications. Calcium antagonists are particularly effective in these patients; other agents are useful in selected situations. Drugs that are likely to cause central nervous system side effects or orthostatic hypotension generally should be avoided in this patient population. Therapy should begin with a low dose and be titrated upward slowly, thus avoiding excessive reduction of blood pressure and the development of orthostatic hypotension. Treatment should be altered as necessary to minimize side effects that may impair quality of life or lead to poor compliance.\r"

Two thirds of people over age 65 have blood pressure higher than 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic. Isolated systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) is also highly prevalent. In a number of clinical trials, treatment of diastolic hypertension in the elderly has been shown to be beneficial, although the value of treatment of isolated systolic hypertension is not yet established. The benefit of antihypertensive therapy on the incidence of stroke and heart failure has been clearly established, but prevention of the atherosclerotic complications of high blood pressure (sudden death or myocardial infarction, for example) has not been convincingly demonstrated. Since clinical trials designed to investigate this atherosclerotic complication of hypertension have relied on stepped-care regimens (diuretics and beta blockers), the question arises whether the use of different drugs might have a better effect on prevention of myocardial infarction. The basis for this supposition includes the known adverse effects of diuretics and beta blockers on electrolytes, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and quality of life. Hypertension treatment in the 1990s will focus on the mechanisms by which blood pressure is lowered by various antihypertensive agents, as well as individualization of drug therapy based on coexisting diseases and conditions. Emphasis will be placed on use of monotherapy whenever possible; diuretics in low doses will probably be used more frequently for second-line therapy. In recognition of their lack of adverse lipid effects and their tolerability, first-line therapy with alpha blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists will become increasingly common. The goal of antihypertensive therapy will be to extend the life expectancy of hypertensive patients to that of subjects without high blood pressure; hopefully, these new treatment approaches will bring us closer to that goal.\r"

In the cardiovascular system this applies to the vasculature and the myocardium alike. In the aged population, where hypertension is a known risk factor, manifestations of vascular injury include atherogenesis and stroke. The newly developed dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonist amlodipine was used in investigations to determine whether calcium antagonists with sustained activity, in addition to lowering blood pressure, slow the development of atherogenesis in rabbits receiving high cholesterol diets, or reduce mortality in stroke-prone hypertensive rats. To establish whether this drug protects the vasculature against excessive atheroma formation in the presence of high cholesterol intake, rabbits were given 2% cholesterol in addition to their normal food intake and either 0, 1, or 5 mg/kg/day amlodipine orally for either 8 or 12 weeks. One day after the conclusion of the treatment protocol, the thoracic aorta was excised, assayed for calcium or cholesterol concentrations, and stained to identify sudanophilic-positive lesions. Amlodipine caused a time- and dose-dependent reduction in lesion formation, calcium overload, and cholesterol level. In the second series of experiments, amlodipine (5 mg/kg/day) was added to the diets of stroke-prone hypertensive rats. Treatment was initiated at age 5 weeks and continued for 30 weeks. During the treatment period, systolic blood pressure was reduced in the amlodipine-treated rats (166 +/- 9 mm Hg) versus those treated with placebo (248 +/- 12 mm Hg) (p less than 0.001). A significant reduction in mortality was observed in the amlodipine-treated rats (p less than 0.001), with 93% surviving versus only 26% in the placebo group at the end of the 30-week treatment period. Concomitantly, cardiac hypertrophy was attenuated in the treated group compared with the placebo group (heart-to-body weight ratios of 4.5 +/- 0.01 vs 5.8 +/- 0.6, respectively [p less than 0.01]). These results extend the evidence that calcium antagonists provide vascular protection in animal models. This finding may become increasingly important in the management of an aging hypertensive population.\r"

Four basic philosophical perspectives concerning the relationship between mind and body are introduced. The biopsychosocial model, at this time the preeminent model in medical science that addresses this relationship, is examined and found to be flawed. Mental-physical identity theory is presented as the most valid philosophical approach to understanding the relationship between mind and body. Organic unity theory is then proposed as a synthesis of the biopsychosocial model and mental-physical identity theory in which the difficulties of the biopsychosocial model are resolved. Finally, some implications of organic unity theory for psychiatry are considered. 1) The conventional dichotomy between physical (organic) and mental (functional) is linguistic/conceptual rather than inherent in nature, and all events and processes involved in the etiology, pathogenesis, symptomatic manifestation, and treatment of psychiatric disorders are simultaneously biological and psychological. 2) Neuroscience requires new conceptual models to comprehend the integrated and emergent physiological processes to which psychological phenomena correspond. 3) Introspective awareness provides data that are valid for scientific inquiry and is the most direct method of knowing psychophysical events. 4) Energy currently being expended in disputes between biological and psychological psychiatry would be more productively invested in attempting to formulate the conditions under which each approach is maximally effective.\r"

Therefore, the authors made a systematic search of the psychiatric and psychological literature for empirical studies dealing with the comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with other disorders. DATA COLLECTION: The search terms included hyperactivity, hyperkinesis, attention deficit disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cross-referenced with antisocial disorder (aggression, conduct disorder, antisocial disorder), depression (depression, mania, depressive disorder, bipolar), anxiety (anxiety disorder, anxiety), learning problems (learning, learning disability, academic achievement), substance abuse (alcoholism, drug abuse), mental retardation, and Tourette's disorder. FINDINGS: The literature supports considerable comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, learning disabilities, and other disorders, such as mental retardation, Tourette's syndrome, and borderline personality disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder might be delineated on the basis of the disorder's comorbidity with other disorders. These subgroups may have differing risk factors, clinical courses, and pharmacological responses. Thus, their proper identification may lead to refinements in preventive and treatment strategies. Investigation of these issues should help to clarify the etiology, course, and outcome of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\r"

METHOD: Papers reviewed were initially selected by using a Medline search. This procedure resulted in 225 papers being reviewed, which were further selected by limiting the papers to those reporting original research. Finally, studies were assessed as to whether or not they used control groups or objective, validated symptom measures. RESULTS: Adverse sequelae occur in a minority of women, and when such symptoms occur, they usually seem to be the continuation of symptoms that appeared before the abortion and are on the wane immediately after the abortion. Many women denied abortion show ongoing resentment that may last for years, while children born when the abortion is denied have numerous, broadly based difficulties in social, interpersonal, and occupational functions that last at least into early adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing pressure on access to abortion services in North America, nonpsychiatrist physicians and mental health professionals need to keep in mind the effects of both performing and denying therapeutic abortion. Increased research into these areas, focusing in particular on why some women are adversely affected by the procedure and clarifying the relationship issues involved, continues to be important.\r"

METHOD: Of 187 veterans referred to the study through a Veterans Administration hospital, 100 were confirmed by means of a structured questionnaire and five clinical interviews as having had combat experience in Vietnam and as meeting the DSM-III criteria for PTSD. The analysis is based on these 100 cases. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 100 veterans had made a postservice suicide attempt, and 15 more had been preoccupied with suicide since the war. Five factors were significantly related to suicide attempts: guilt about combat actions, survivor guilt, depression, anxiety, and severe PTSD. Logistic regression analysis showed that combat guilt was the most significant predictor of both suicide attempts and preoccupation with suicide. For a significant percentage of the suicidal veterans, such disturbing combat behavior as the killing of women and children took place while they were feeling emotionally out of control because of fear or rage. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, PTSD among Vietnam combat veterans emerged as a psychiatric disorder with considerable risk for suicide, and intensive combat-related guilt was found to be the most significant explanatory factor. These findings point to the need for greater clinical attention to the role of guilt in the evaluation and treatment of suicidal veterans with PTSD.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of symptom threshold and criteria set selections on the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults and children exposed to a man-made disaster and determine how well DSM-III and its successors agree. METHOD: Data gathered in the course of a voluntary clinical screening for PTSD in 66 adults and 64 children 6 to 14 months after exposure to a school shooting were analyzed according to DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and proposed DSM-IV criteria for PTSD diagnosis and cluster endorsement using liberal (occurring at least a little of the time), moderate (occurring at least some of the time), and conservative (occurring at least much or most of the time) symptom thresholds. RESULTS: Within DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and proposed DSM-IV, selection of liberal, moderate, and conservative symptom thresholds had robust effects on rates of diagnoses; liberal thresholds allowed the greatest frequencies of diagnosis. Compared with DSM-III and proposed DSM-IV, DSM-III-R generally diagnosed the fewest cases. Agreements between DSM-III-R and proposed DSM-IV were good, while agreements between DSM-III and its successors varied for children and adults. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic rates and agreements were complexly influenced by interactions among threshold and revisions in symptom clusters. The present study suggests that attempts to refine PTSD classification consider specification of symptom threshold intensity and supports the view that modification of criteria sets be undertaken with caution.\r"

The authors' objectives were to describe the results of a comprehensive clinical and laboratory assessment and to perform a double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing buspirone, cognitive-behavior therapy, and the combination of these treatments for performance anxiety. METHOD: Ninety-four subjects were recruited by mass media announcements and were seen in a university-based outpatient psychiatric clinic. Assessments were 1) questionnaires for all 94 subjects, 2) diagnostic interview of 50 subjects, and 3) laboratory performance of 34 subjects. Treatment conditions were 1) 6 weeks of buspirone, 2) 6 weeks of placebo, 3) a five-session, group cognitive-behavior therapy program with buspirone, or 4) the cognitive-behavior therapy program with placebo. Treatment outcome measures included subjective anxiety ratings and heart rate measures during a laboratory performance, a questionnaire measure of performance confidence, and a blind rating of musical performance quality. RESULTS: All subjects fulfilled criteria for DSM-III-R social phobia. Of the 15 full-time professional musicians, ten had tried propranolol and three had stopped performing. Most of the subjects had substantial anxiety and heart rate increases during laboratory speech and musical performances. Cognitive-behavior therapy resulted in statistically significant reductions in subjective anxiety, improved quality of musical performance, and improved performance confidence. Buspirone was not an effective treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-behavior therapy is a viable treatment approach for performance anxiety in musicians.\r"

METHOD: Seventy-four U.S. patients given the diagnosis of schizophrenia according to Research Diagnostic Criteria were longitudinally assessed at hospitalization and at three intervals up to 10 years after illness onset. The longitudinal criteria for type of onset, course of illness, and outcome were derived from the European studies of Manfred Bleuler and Luc Ciompi. The type of onset, course of illness, and outcome of the U.S. patients were compared with those of the patients in the two European studies. RESULTS: A lower rate of acute onset and of episodic illness was found in the U.S. patients, but the relative frequency of a number of major overall course patterns was similar across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite many potential threats to comparability, the results of the European and U.S. longitudinal studies of the course of schizophrenia were fairly congruent in terms of the relative rate with which patients fell into the categories established by Bleuler and Ciompi. These results are encouraging in that they point to the possibility of estimating the rate of occurrence of particular expressions of the overall course of schizophrenia.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of DSM-III-R schizoaffective disorder, the authors explored the morbid risks for schizophrenia and major affective disorders in the first-degree relatives of patients with schizoaffective disorder and relevant other diagnoses. METHOD: In addition to patients with DSM-III-R schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (N = 21), the probands included patients with mood-incongruent psychotic depression (N = 22), mood-congruent psychotic depression (N = 19), nonpsychotic depression (N = 27), or schizophrenia (N = 28) and normal subjects (N = 18). The patients were consecutively recruited from the outpatient facilities of a university psychiatry department; the normal subjects were students and nurses. All probands were directly interviewed, with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia--Lifetime Version (SADS-L), by a psychiatrist blind to information about relatives. Consenting relatives were directly interviewed, with the SADS-L, by two psychiatrists blind to the probands' diagnoses. The direct interview was supplemented--or replaced, when an interview was not possible (24%)--by family history data from all available sources. Morbid risks in relatives were calculated according to the Weinberg method. RESULTS: The relatives of the schizoaffective patients had almost the same risk for schizophrenia as the relatives of the schizophrenic patients. In the relatives of the patients mood-incongruent psychotic depression, the morbid risk for major affective disorders was about one-half that of the relatives of the patients with mood-congruent psychotic depression and one-third that of the relatives of the patients with nonpsychotic depression, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DSM-III-R schizoaffective disorder is close to schizophrenia and largely corresponds to mainly schizophrenic schizoaffective disorder in the Research Diagnostic Criteria, whereas DSM-III-R mood-incongruent psychotic depression is probably quite heterogeneous and should be studied further.\r"

METHOD: The authors studied 21 patients 60 years or older with major depression, 16 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 14 age-matched control subjects. RESULTS: Compared to control subjects, depressed patients had greater cerebral sulcal and temporal sulcal atrophy; larger sylvian fissures, lateral ventricles, third ventricles, and temporal horns; and greater severity of subcortical white matter lesions. Depressed patients also had more basal ganglia lesions but similar levels of periventricular hyperintensity. There were no differences between depressed patients with and without delusions on any MRI measure. Depressed patients who received ECT had more temporal horn atrophy and greater subcortical abnormality summary scores than normal subjects. Cortical sulcal atrophy correlated with age at onset of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that elderly hospitalized depressed patients have greater cortical as well as subcortical atrophy and more basal ganglia lesions than age-matched normal control subjects. The correlation of these abnormalities with outcome remains unknown.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated changes in brain function associated with cocaine dependence and withdrawal to provide clues regarding the processes that lead to the uncontrollable self-administration of cocaine. METHOD: They measured regional brain metabolism with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography in 15 outpatients with the diagnosis of cocaine abuse and 17 normal comparison subjects. Ten of the patients were studied less than 1 week after they had last had cocaine, and five were studied 2-4 weeks after withdrawal. RESULTS: Patients studied within 1 week of cocaine withdrawal but not those studied within 2-4 weeks of cocaine withdrawal had higher levels of global brain metabolism as well as higher levels of regional brain metabolism in the basal ganglia and orbitofrontal cortex than did normal subjects, probably as a consequence of less brain dopamine activity. There was also a significant relationship between the number of days since cocaine withdrawal and regional brain glucose metabolism in the orbitofrontal cortex and in the basal ganglia, and the correlations between cocaine craving and metabolic activity were significant in the prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Although the time-dependent fall in metabolic activity suggests that the higher metabolic activity observed less than a week after cocaine withdrawal may represent a nonspecific expression of drug withdrawal, the selectivity of changes in glucose metabolism for the basal ganglia and for the orbitofrontal cortex suggests that the regional metabolic changes seen in cocaine abusers during detoxification are related to changes in brain dopamine activity.\r"

In a double-blind trial, 10 subjects were given acetorphan intravenously and nine were given clonidine; objective signs and subjective symptoms of withdrawal were recorded. RESULTS: On several objective signs, the effect of acetorphan was more marked than that of clonidine, whereas the two drugs exhibited similar efficacy with respect to the subjective components of withdrawal. No side effect was noted in the subjects who received acetorphan. CONCLUSIONS: Enkephalinase inhibition may constitute a novel and safe therapeutic approach to the opioid withdrawal syndrome.\r"

METHOD: Of subjects who sought outpatient treatment, 168 consented to participate in the study and were each randomly assigned to one of the three forms of therapy; 122 patients were interviewed 6-12 months later. Their pre- and posttreatment scores on the Addiction Severity Index were compared. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed for the cohort as a whole, but virtually all of the improvement was restricted to the 23 subjects (19%) who were not using cocaine at follow-up. There was a strong relationship between abstinence from cocaine use and absence of addiction-related problems, especially psychiatric symptoms and family problems. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that outpatient therapy once a week is ineffective for cocaine use disorder. The 19% abstinence rate probably represents spontaneous remission among patients with enough motivation to seek treatment, as the number of therapy sessions attended was not related to improvement. Either an intense level of outpatient contact or residential treatment followed by aftercare is probably needed, at least initially, while the patient is attempting to initiate and sustain abstinence.\r"

RESULTS: Twenty percent of these subjects reported sharing needles within the previous 6 months. Those who shared reported greater difficulty in acquiring new needles, more legal difficulties, more severe drug problems, and higher levels of psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that patients who continue to share needles are a more disturbed subgroup of the methadone maintenance population.

METHOD: HIV-positive volunteers (N = 77) were evaluated at entry into a longitudinal neurological study. Forty were asymptomatic, 29 had AIDS-related complex, and eight had AIDS. The subjects were not selected for the presence or absence of cognitive or motor complaints. Complaints of cognitive and motor dysfunction were assessed with items from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Macro Neurologic Exam. Current depression and anxiety were assessed with the Profile of Mood States. Psychiatric status was assessed with the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule, a structured interview that provides DSM-III psychiatric diagnoses. Actual cognitive and motor performance was measured with standard neuropsychological tests known to be sensitive to the effects of HIV. RESULTS: Cognitive complaints were found in 38 (49%) of the subjects. These complaints were associated with psychiatric symptoms but not with cognitive performance. Motor complaints, found in 12 (16%) of the subjects, were associated with poorer motor performance but not with psychiatric symptoms. The overall frequency of psychiatric diagnosis was high. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reports of cognitive and motor dysfunction were common in this unselected group and are of concern to health care providers. Potentially treatable psychiatric conditions were also common, particularly in subjects with cognitive complaints, and appropriate treatment referrals are indicated. Patients who report motor dysfunction should be neurologically evaluated for treatable causes.\r"

In the infrequent case that these costs have been assessed, they have been estimated by using national surveys of consumers of health services. The objective of this study was to estimate the costs of prescriptions for psychotropic medications in the United States in 1985 and to assess the difference with the most recent cost estimate from a health services survey (1977). METHOD: Study data were based on retail costs of psychotropic medications reported to the Pharmaceutical Data Service Alpha National Prescription and Sales Audit. The data come from a computerized survey panel of 2,250 pharmacies representative of the more than 14,000 pharmacies nationwide. The database includes all medication prescriptions filled, whether paid with cash or Medicaid or reimbursed by third-party payment. Analyses were limited to psychotropic medication prescriptions. RESULTS: In 1985, $1.45 billion was spent on outpatient psychotropic medications. Nearly $868 million (60% of the total) was spent on antianxiety and sedative-hypnotic medications, while approximately $263 million (18%) was spent on antipsychotic medications, $240 million (17%) on antidepressants, and $84 million (5%) on combination psychotropic medications. These expenditures were much higher than would have been expected given the most recent health services estimate of $513 million. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the substantial cost of psychotropic medications in 1985. The finding that the cost of psychotropic medications was so high, in contrast to the lower estimate from the 1977 survey, demonstrates the importance of obtaining more frequent cost estimates and basing future estimates on medication databases.\r"

These patients were given structured diagnostic interviews, and their family histories of psychiatric disorders were assessed blindly. The patients' responses to psychosocial and biological treatments were also assessed. RESULTS: All of the kleptomanic patients had lifetime diagnoses of major mood disorders, 16 had lifetime diagnoses of anxiety disorders, and 12 had lifetime diagnoses of eating disorders. A high morbid risk of major mood disorders (0.31) was found in their first-degree relatives. Ten of 18 patients receiving thymoleptic medications reported reduction or remission of their stealing behavior.

METHODS: Sixty-four normal volunteer subjects were hypnotized, and an attempt was made to induce auditory hallucinations. The subjects in whom hallucinations were successfully induced were then asked to perform the mouth-opening maneuver and the control maneuvers of putting their fingers in their ears or squeezing their eyes shut in an effort to end the hallucinations. RESULTS: Sixteen subjects reported having hallucinations. None of them reported that a hallucination was abolished by opening the mouth or closing the eye; four reported ending hallucinations by putting their fingers in their ears. CONCLUSIONS: Opening the mouth does not affect auditory hallucinations induced by hypnosis in normal persons. The most likely reason for the discrepancy between the results of this experiment and those of the Bick and Kinsbourne study is that the design of the latter study was faulty because it permitted demand characteristics to influence the results.\r"

METHOD: The authors reviewed nine reports on dyskinesia prevalence that included history of neuroleptic treatment and related prevalence to age. A rating of 2 or more on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale or an equivalent score on another scale was considered an indication of dyskinesia. If the subject had taken neuroleptics for more than 3 months, the movement disorder was classified as neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia; other dyskinesias were considered spontaneous. The prevalence of tardive dyskinesia was defined as the rate of neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia minus the rate of spontaneous dyskinesia. RESULTS: The true rate of tardive dyskinesia was below 20% for all age groups except 70-79 years. The correlation between the rate of neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia and the rate of spontaneous dyskinesia was low. CONCLUSIONS: After age 40 the prevalence of spontaneous dyskinesia is sufficiently high to conclude that many patients with diagnoses of tardive dyskinesia have abnormal movements attributable to causes other than neuroleptics.\r"

  ".W": "Intermediate filaments are major components of most eukaryotic cells that form from the polymerization of protein subunits that are expressed in tissue and development specific fashions. The interactions of intermediate filaments with a myriad of other cellular proteins and structures give rise to a complex overall cellular architecture that is likely responsible for cellular well-being. The mature 10-nm filaments are relatively stable cellular structures, but the intermediate filaments undergo major morphological and biochemical changes, especially during mitosis, differentiation, and in response to certain drugs. Evidence exists that hepatocyte intermediate filaments (keratin filaments) are deranged in alcoholic hepatitis, an inflammatory liver disease of alcoholics and heavy spree drinkers. The classical and characteristic pathological hepatocyte inclusion bodies of alcoholic hepatitis, Mallory bodies, are composed in part of normal keratins that likely derive from the pre-existing hepatocyte intermediate filament network. It is unclear if intermediate filament network derangement in alcoholic hepatitis is directly caused by the actions of ethanol or its metabolites on intermediate filaments or their associated structures, or whether alcohol causes a cellular insult or injury elsewhere and a subsequent response (e.g., immune) causes intermediate filament network derangement. The precise mechanisms responsible for intermediate filament derangement remain to be elucidated; however, experimental data exist that support and refute several hypotheses. Hopefully, further studies will help determine a better overall understanding of the abnormalities of intermediate filaments and their relationship to the pathophysiology of alcoholic hepatitis and other diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Neuronal death is one of the most serious consequences of alcohol exposure during development. Studies described in this paper used a neonatal rat model to address factors affecting neuronal death following alcohol exposure during the period of rapid brain growth, and relate them to possible mechanisms of damage. The profile of blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) is an important variable influencing both brain growth deficits and neuronal death--a smaller daily dose of alcohol can be more damaging than a larger daily dose, if it is consumed in a binge-like pattern that produces relatively higher BACs. Alcohol exposure for a single day also can be damaging, producing both brain growth deficits and neuron loss, if high BACs are obtained. Various brain regions and different neuronal populations within a given brain area exhibit different degrees of vulnerability. Some neuronal loss clearly is a function of cell death due to direct effects of alcohol, while other deficits may be due to either primary or secondary effects of the alcohol insult. In the cerebellum, a maturational or metabolic factor also appears to be involved with alcohol-induced neuronal death. Immunocytochemical studies using a monoclonal antibody against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) indicated that cerebellar lobules containing Purkinje cells that are in the process of extending dendrites are ones that are more vulnerable to alcohol than lobules containing Purkinje cells that mature later. Alcohol exposure during brain development may be producing neuron attrition in multiple ways, including disruption of membrane integrity, inhibition of protein synthesis or other alterations such as lipid solubility, or by disruption of cytoskeletal elements.\r"

This paper describes studies of an in vitro cardiac myocyte model in which the major effort was to investigate growth and development parameters in an obligate interacting multicellular system. The well defined events of in vitro myogenesis allow for documentation or dysgenesis and altered growth in the presence of the taratogen, ethanol. The cells exposed to ethanol did not mature morphologically or functionally compared with controls. Increasing concentrations of ethanol appear to have a graded damaging effect. The greater the concentration of ethanol the more profound the dyssynchronous growth. The morphologic correlates were multinucleation, and alteration in the ultrastructural organization of cell-cell contacts and myofilaments. Correlation of these findings with those observed in dysgenic muscle of human infants and rat pups exposed to ethanol in utero, may provide at least a partial understanding of the teratogenic manifestation of ethanol in embryogenesis and organogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "In humans and in animal models the most frequently observed alcohol-related birth defect (ARBD) is intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). The central nervous system (CNS) is sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of in utero ethanol exposure and neonatal CNS alterations with associated behavioral deficits are a likely result of maternal ethanol consumption. Presently, little information exists as to the biochemical mechanism by which ethanol inhibits fetal CNS growth. Further, it is unknown if there are genetic differences in maternal or fetal responses to ethanol. Ongoing research using a chick model indicates that pharmacologically appropriate doses of ethanol (less than 30 mM) inhibit brain growth and reduce CNS 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) with an associated 50% decrease in the binding of cyclic AMP by the regulatory subunit (RII) of protein kinase A. Furthermore, there is a specific loss of phosphorylation of RII by kinase catalytic subunit as a result of ethanol exposure. Because tissue cyclic AMP content and the degree of RII phosphorylation are important parameters for the regulation of protein kinase A catalytic activity, it is hypothesized that these alterations may be biochemical transformations that underlie ethanol-induced growth suppression.\r"

Blood samples were drawn before drinking and between 2 to 46 hr after starting the drinking session. While there were no significant increases in blood acetaldehyde levels in these samples, acetaldehyde-hemoglobin adducts were significantly increased in the samples drawn after ethanol had been eliminated from the body. Administration of ethanol (0.1 g/kg) to an Oriental flusher resulted in an increase both in blood acetaldehyde and the hemoglobin-acetaldehyde adduct levels. These results suggest that acetaldehyde-hemoglobin condensates are formed in vivo following acute ethanol ingestion. Such condensates may be of value to mark alcohol consumption.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a sensitive cation exchange liquid chromatographic method for analysis of acetaldehyde binding with hemoglobin. When human hemolysates were incubated in vitro with micromolar concentrations of acetaldehyde without reducing agents, HbA0 was found to form two new fractions. One of them was eluated with HbA1c, whereas a novel, previously undescribed fraction was detected between HbF and HbA1c. This new fraction was termed HbA1ach. The mean within-assay variation for the different hemoglobin fractions varied from 0.45 (HbA0) to 8.2% (HbA1ach) and the between-assay variation from 0.6 to 19.3%, respectively. After incubation with [1,2(14)C]acetaldehyde the specific radioactivity of HbA1ach was about 10 times higher than that of HbA0 and twice as high as the activity of the HbA1c fraction. The reaction kinetics of the formation of hemoglobin adducts were studied in vitro by incubation of hemolysates with various acetaldehyde concentrations. Acetaldehyde caused both short-term and permanent changes in hemoglobin. Even low acetaldehyde concentrations from 10 to 100 mumol/liter caused detectable changes in hemoglobin. During incubation the amount of HbA1ach and HbA1c fractions increased rapidly within the first 10 min and decreased slowly during the next hr but did not return to the initial levels. This suggests that only the part of binding of acetaldehyde with hemoglobin is irreversible and the changes can be already detected after incubation with physiological acetaldehyde concentrations.\r"

This cell line proved to be sensitive to alcohol, since alcohol increased gamma-GT activity both in cells and media. The most striking result was the increase of ferritin in cells and media by alcohol. Moreover, this effect was specific, since it contrasted with a decrease in total protein synthesis and secretion, a decrease in transferrin excretion and a lack of effect on orosomucoid. In our model, alcohol was able to induce, in a specific manner, ferritin expression.\r"

In the current research, 114 college students completed the MAST along with an additional question: \"Have you ever attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous because of your own problem drinking?\" The results indicated that seven of 114 subjects (6.1%) attained inflated MAST scores because they had attended an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, but not for their own problem drinking.

  ".W": "The aim was to compare alcohol consumption and vocational adjustment as criteria of rehabilitation progress of alcoholics, with regard to links to concomitant changes in functioning in other life areas. Thirty-four advanced alcohol abusers in rehabilitation were examined twice with an interval of 2 years between each examination. Change scores in alcohol consumption and work capacity were correlated with change scores in social network, activities, life-satisfaction, psychological well-being, psychiatric symptoms, and biomedical functioning. Improved drinking habits were connected with some changes in overall functioning, however not solely in a favorable direction. Negative mood changes were especially noteworthy. Improvements in vocational adjustment, on the other hand, appeared to be somewhat more unequivocally and encompassingly associated with amelioration in the wider range of functioning. The results indicate that drinking measures alone are not sufficient indicators of progress in rehabilitation and underscores the need of more global criteria of general adjustment.\r"

One prevalent view states that these well-delineated cognitive changes are directly related to a selective disruption of right hemisphere function. The present study tested this hypothesis using dichotic listening measures of functional asymmetry. Both alcoholics and older nonalcoholics evidenced patterns of cognitive preservation and impairment similar to those seen in patients with known right hemisphere dysfunction. Nevertheless, dichotic listening findings did not reveal any selective effect on the right hemisphere, as previously proposed. The dichotic studies supported the view that both hemispheres are affected by aging and alcoholism. Patients with right hemisphere lesions demonstrated characteristic and predictable changes in dichotic asymmetries, illustrating the reliability of the dichotic measures as indices of hemispheric function.\r"

Blood ethanol concentrations in ethanol-exposed rats were usually between 200 and 300 mg/dl. Glutathione, vitamin E, and malondialdehyde concentrations were measured in lung homogenates, and antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase) were determined in the supernatant fractions. For comparison, the measurements were also made using liver fractions. Ethanol treatment increased the activities of catalase (117%) and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (25%) in lung but not in liver. Although chronic ethanol inhalation lowered hepatic glutathione (19%) and hepatic vitamin E (33%), there was no increase in malondialdehyde content in either liver or lung of ethanol-exposed rats. The elevation of pulmonary antioxidant enzyme activities could be interpreted to mean that lung is a target for ethanol-induced oxidative stress. However, as there was no loss of pulmonary GSH or vitamin E and no increase in malondialdehyde formation, it appears that long-term ethanol exposure did not produce a significant degree of oxidative stress in rat lung.\r"

Measurements included the total number and length of all segments/network, the total number and length of segments within topologically defined segment categories, and the mean length of segments in each category. A main effect of ethanol was expressed as a significant increase in cumulative length within one category of terminal segments. This increase was the result of a significant increase in mean length/segment in that category. Metric changes in other segment categories were not significant, showing that changes in the networks during ethanol treatment were not distributed randomly. Recovery after ethanol treatment was associated with further nonrandom remodeling of these networks. Significant differences in lengths of terminal segments were no longer present, but internal segments in networks of both pair-fed and ethanol-fed rats were significantly longer. Only one category of internal segments showed this change during recovery. The data showed that long term ethanol treatment in old rats, at a time when effects of aging processes were prominent in Purkinje cell networks, was associated with remodeling of those networks through dendritic extension. This effect was interpreted as compensatory growth in surviving networks following ethanol-related neuronal loss and/or damage to the surrounding neuropil. Recovery from dietary treatment produced further internal remodeling of those networks that was not related specifically to ethanol. It could be shown, however, that the restructuring processes that resulted in longer internal segments after dietary recovery were different in the pair-fed and the ethanolfed rats.\r"

Parental alcoholism was associated with more severe alcoholism on most parameters of alcohol use (age of onset, quantity, frequency, preoccupation, and sustained use) and alcohol-related problems (social, vocational, physical, cognitive, and loss of control). The association between parental history of alcoholism and more severe alcoholism in the probands was independent of age of onset of alcoholism, current age, socioeconomic background, and marital status. Parental history positive (PH+) alcoholics were more reliant on alcohol to manage their moods but did not differ significantly from parental history negative (PH-) alcoholics in the use of alcohol to improve sociability or mental functioning or to cope with marital problems. Surprisingly, the degree of concern, guilt, and worry over the negative consequences of drinking was not significantly different for PH+ alcoholics although the negative consequences were clearly much more severe for this group. While the data are inconclusive about the reasons for more severe alcoholism in PH+ alcoholics, greater reliance on ethanol to manage moods and a relative insensitivity to negative consequences could theoretically account for the vulnerability to more severe alcoholism found in PH+ alcoholics.\r"

Whether an effector cellular immune response can be generated against these acetaldehyde modified adducts on syngeneic cells is not known. In this paper we have demonstrated in the murine system that acetaldehyde modified splenic cells can generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). These CTL are specific for the acetaldehyde modified syngeneic cells, and not acetaldehyde modified allogeneic cells. The ability of the CTL to lyse-specific targets is dependent on the formation of stable acetaldehyde adducts. Cold target inhibition studies reveal that modified syngeneic cells can inhibit lysis as effectively as unmodified cells. Therefore, the present study lends support to the hypothesis that acetaldehyde modified cells can generate a cellular immune response and may do so in pathologic states.\r"

Norepinephrine (10(-3) M, 10(-4) M, and 10(-5) M) significantly increased phosphoinositide turnover in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, locus ceruleus, cerebellum, and cortex within each line of mice. Basal and norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover were significantly higher in the SS mice as compared with the LS mice in the cerebellum and cortex but not the other brain regions. Incorporation of 3H-inositol into 3H-phosphatidylinositols was not different between SS and LS mice in the cerebellum and cortex. The greater norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover in the cerebellum and cortex of the SS versus the LS mice may contribute to the CNS sensitivity to ethanol in these two lines of mice. However, ethanol (500 mM) had no effect on basal or norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover in any of the five brain areas examined in the LS and SS mice.\r"

The type O subjects had significantly higher bone densities as measured by quantitative computed tomography of the vertebrae than the non-O subjects (175.4 +/- 8.5 and 140.7 +/- 7.6, respectively, p = 0.004). There were no differences in age and indices of their alcoholism. Using multiple stepwise regression analysis, neither race nor maximal amount of alcohol consumed appeared to contribute to the differences in bone density. Only age, number of years of regular alcohol use and ABO blood type were determinants of the bone density differences. The ABO blood type contributed 20.3% to the differences in bone density (p = 0.001). The patients with non-O blood type lost a significant amount of bone with advancing age (r = -0.76, p = 0.0001) while those with blood type O did not (r = -0.37, p = 0.11). We conclude that, although alcoholism is a factor in the development of osteopenia, in males the ABO blood group status plays a significant role in the maximal mineralization of the skeleton and the amount of bone resorption during ageing, independent of alcohol abuse.\r"

Before abstinence, all three levels were shown significantly depressed in the alcoholic patients compared with the controls, in both plasma (80, 71, and 89% of control values) and erythrocytes (68, 70, and 83% of control values). After a 14-day abstinence period with no dietary supplementation, a trend towards normalization was noted in erythrocyte (vitamin E and glutathione peroxidase 74 and 91% of control values respectively), in whole blood selenium (82%) and plasma in vitamin E (74%). However, plasma selenium and glutathione peroxidase values were lower than pre-abstinence values (76% and 86% of control values respectively). Our results point to a deficiency in the antioxidant defense system of chronic alcoholics before the occurrence of severe liver disease. This lack of protection against lipoperoxides is all the more important in circumstances like chronic alcohol consumption, in which lipid peroxidation is known to increase. However, the present study also demonstrated that during 14 days of a normal diet free of ethanol, a rapid trend occurred towards the normalization of the factors.\r"

Rats that initially preferred alcohol decreased alcohol preference during shock days, whereas, rats that initially avoided alcohol increased alcohol preference during shock days.

Their mean age was 29 years and 78% were men. The impact of intoxication was examined in 59 patients who had ethanol levels measured. Ethanol was detectable in 40 patients and greater than or equal to 100 mg/dl in 31. There were significant correlations between the extent of neurologic dysfunction, determined by the Glasgow Coma Score and plasma cortisol concentrations 1 and 4 days postaccident. Cortisol levels were universally elevated on admission and approached normal 7 days later. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant effects of circulating ethanol levels on the association between cortisol concentrations and progressively worsening neurologic function, i.e., ethanol reduced the magnitude of the cortisol elevations in a dose dependent manner, abolishing this relationship at levels above 100 mg/dl. Analysis of the relationships between circulating cortisol levels and patient outcome provided a second method for ascertaining the association between injury severity and the magnitude of adrenocortical activation. Admission and day 1 cortisol concentrations were 25 to 40% lower in patients having good recoveries or moderate disabilities than those who remained severely disabled, persistently vegetative or died; serum cortisol values of less than 20 micrograms/dl one day after the accident were more likely to be associated with a good outcome than a poor one (55 vs. 25%, p less than 0.001). The worsening prognosis of patients having higher cortisol values is further reflected in the duration of acute hospitalization of these individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used hepatocytes freshly isolated from fed rats or rats that had fasted, suspended them in Krebs' buffer, and incubated them in sealed flasks under O2/CO2 or N2/CO2 (95%:5%). The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ratio (ATP/ADP) measured cellular energy balance--the balance between overall ATP supply and demand. Lactate levels measured the extent to which ATP was supplied by the nonmitochondrial pathway, (anaerobic) glycolysis. Maximum values of energy balance were seen in cells from fed rats incubated in the presence of glucose and O2. When glucose was replaced by fructose, ATP/ADP decreased and lactate increased. During anoxia (O2 replaced by N2), increases in lactate were also seen with glucose; and ATP/ADP decreased to similarly low values with both substrates. In cells from fasted rats, ATP/ADP decreased significantly below the value for cells from fed rats only in the presence of glucose and O2. Compared with cells from fed rats, cells from fasted rats showed decreased lactate in the face of decreased ATP/ADP, suggesting that glycolysis was impaired. Isoflurane partially prevented anoxia-induced decreases in ATP/ADP. This protective effect on energy balance occurred equally with glucose and fructose, but was not seen in cells from fasted rats or with halothane. Thus, 1 MAC isoflurane and some factor(s) related to the fed state combined to protect partially the energy balance in anoxic liver cells through action(s) at the cellular level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To establish anesthesia with minimal respiratory and cardiovascular depression using propofol, the effects of varying the rate of delivery on anesthetic induction dose requirements and hemodynamic changes were studied in four groups of 20 patients each undergoing body surface surgery. All patients were premedicated with temazepam and received 1.5 micrograms/kg fentanyl 5 min before induction. Propofol was delivered at 50, 100, or 200 mg/min by the Ohmeda 9000 infusion pump (groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) or by bolus of 2 mg/kg (group 4) until loss of verbal contact. Anesthesia was maintained thereafter with propofol infused at 6 mg.kg-1.h-1. Using slower infusion rates, induction took significantly longer (124, 92, 62, and 32 s in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively) and was achieved with significantly smaller doses of propofol (1.40, 1.96, 2.61, and 2.15 mg/kg in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Slow infusion (groups 1 and 2) caused less depression of systolic and diastolic blood pressure than rapid infusion (groups 3 and 4), but the differences were not statistically significant. Patients in groups 3 and 4 had significantly greater decreases in pulse rate and a greater incidence of apnea than did patients in group 1. There was no correlation between the size of the induction dose and subsequent maintenance requirements of propofol. The finding that the sleep dose of propofol is reduced at slower infusion rates has important practical and theoretical implications when considering the relative potencies of intravenous anesthetics.\r"

Simultaneous Doppler, TD, and TTU measurements of CO were made before and after changes in preload, afterload, or contractility in seven piglets. Mean changes in each CO method for each type of change in CO were compared by analysis of variance. Changes in TTU CO, TD CO, and Doppler CO were compared by correlation, linear regression, and bias and precision statistics. Of 86 TTU changes in CO greater than 10%, Doppler changed the same direction as TTU 59 times, changed in an opposite direction 6 times, and changes less than 10% 21 times. Thermodilution changed in the same direction as TTU 72 times, in the opposite direction 4 times, and changed less than 10% 10 times. Changes (% delta) in TTU and TD measurements of CO were not significantly different in any group. Changes in Doppler CO and TTU CO were different for two afterload and contractility groups. Percent changes in Doppler CO had a correlation coefficient (r) = 0.74, m = 0.72, and bias (mean % delta Doppler CO - mean % delta TTU CO) = 6.3 +/- 29.7 with % delta TTU CO. Percent changes in TD CO had an r = 0.90, m = 0.92, and bias = 5.7 +/- 19.1 with % delta TTU CO. Cardiac output measured by Doppler underestimated changes in CO due to changes in preload and contractility and exaggerated changes in CO due to changes in afterload.\r"

Thirty-six hours after infection, animals (n = 7) showed severely impaired gas exchange and acidosis during artificial ventilation (PaO2 = 152.2 +/- 18.7, PaCO2 = 65.3 +/- 19.2, pH = 7.26 +/- 0.11) with a pressure-controlled mode, standard frequency of 35/min, peak airway pressure of 15 cm H2O (15/0), inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2, and F1O2 = 1. Gas exchange improved (P = 0.02) with increased ventilator pressures with PEEP (25/4). Forty-eight hours after infection, blood gas tensions could no longer be significantly improved by these same ventilator settings (PaO2 = 123.8 +/- 31.0, PaCO2 = 95.1 +/- 43.6, pH = 7.12 +/- 0.16, n = 9). At this time, surfactant replacement dramatically increased arterial oxygenation within 5 min (PaO2 = 389.4 +/- 79.9) and resulted in a fourfold increase in PaO2 within 2 h. It is concluded that intratracheal surfactant administration is a promising approach in the treatment of respiratory failure during adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with viral pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "The combination of catecholamines and halothane has long been recognized as arrhythmogenic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the mechanism of this interaction originates at the single cell level. The incidence of spontaneous contractile waves occurring between stimulated beats (interbeat waves), early aftercontractions, and late aftercontractions was measured in rat myocytes exposed to sympathomimetics with and without halothane. Each of these endpoints in single cells has the potential to produce arrhythmias in multicellular preparations. Interbeat waves and late aftercontractions were observed with isoproterenol (1 X 10(-7) M) and norepinephrine (1-3 X 10(-7) M). The incidence of these phenomena was significantly reduced in the presence of 0.30 mM halothane. Early aftercontractions occurred in the presence of isoproterenol (1 X 10(-7) M), norepinephrine (1-3 X 10(-7) M), and phenylephrine (5-10 X 10(-6) M). There was a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of early aftercontractions in the presence of 0.30 mM halothane. These results indicate that the mechanism behind the clinically observed increased arrhythmogenicity of catecholamines with halothane does not arise at the level of single ventricular cells because halothane inhibited sympathomimetic-induced arrhythmogenic activity in this model. The probable mechanisms rather include altered impulse propagation, which might lead to phenomena such as reentry.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether nitrous oxide (N2O) worsens myocardial ischemia by diminishing coronary pressure, we performed two sets of experiments using an acutely instrumented swine model of regional coronary ischemia. In constant pressure experiments (n = 11), coronary pressure and heart rate were kept constant as N2O (77%-79%) was substituted for N2 in the inspired gas. Nitrous oxide decreased systolic shortening, measured by sonomicrometry, from 68.0% to 63.6% (P less than 0.05) of preischemic control values in the ischemic zone and from 116.2% to 103.2% (P less than 0.05) of control values in the adjacent normal myocardium. There was no disproportionate effect of N2O on ischemic myocardium, and the N2O-induced depression of contractile function was fully reversible. In a series of constant external stenosis experiments (n = 13), the effects of N2O on heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and the coronary stenosis itself were not controlled. In these experiments, substitution of N2O for N2 induced deterioration in both the ischemic zone (systolic shortening decreased from 68.7% to 58.4% of preischemic control values, P less than 0.05) and in the adjacent normal myocardium (systolic shortening decreased from 113% to 102.9% of preischemic control, P less than 0.05). Nitrous-oxide-induced ischemic zone contractile dysfunction was often not reversible. The pressure gradient across the coronary stenosis did not increase and peripheral coronary pressure did not decrease because of N2O. Diffusion hypoxia was also excluded. This study confirms that N2O has a significant but mild depressant effect on the performance of both normal and ischemic myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Droperidol did not modify the resting bronchial tone but prevented the bronchoconstrictor effects of 5-HT in a dose-related manner. Pretreatment with propranolol, hexamethonium, or prazosin did not alter the protective effects of droperidol on 5-HT-induced bronchoconstriction. The bronchoconstrictor responses to histamine or acetylcholine were not affected by droperidol. These results suggest that the protective effects of droperidol on 5-HT-induced bronchoconstriction are mediated through 5-HT receptor blockade on bronchial smooth muscle.\r"

Both intravenous midazolam-alfentanil and fentanyl-propofol techniques produced conditions comparable to those achieved with epidural anesthesia during immersion lithotripsy. Of the two sedative-analgesic techniques, midazolam-alfentanil was associated with greater intraoperative amnesia (81% vs 38%), whereas fentanyl-propofol produced less cardiorespiratory depression and fewer postoperative side effects (e.g., pruritus). Compared with a standard epidural anesthesia technique, the mean anesthesia and recovery times were significantly shorter with the two intravenous sedation-analgesia techniques (57-62 min vs 105 min and 143-147 min vs 199 min, respectively). These data suggest that combinations of either midazolam and alfentanil or fentanyl and propofol are viable alternatives to epidural anesthesia for outpatient immersion lithotripsy.\r"

Significant transpulmonary gradient of plasma dopamine was observed with infusions at rates of 1.0 and 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, but not at 0.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1.

The correlation implies that inhaled anesthetics act in a hydrophobic site and that the solvent used has properties representative of the true site of anesthetic action. We sought to characterize this site more accurately by testing for the solvent that provided the best correlation for a diverse group of anesthetics. We determined the solubility of halothane, enflurane, cyclopropane, fluroxene, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane in benzene, olive oil, Intralipid, n-octanol, and lecithin. We used established MAC values for rats, dogs, and humans for all but sevoflurane and desflurane, for which we determined MAC in rats to be 2.80% +/- 0.24% (mean +/- standard deviation) and 7.71% +/- 0.65%, respectively. Lecithin gave the lowest coefficient of variation for the product of potency (MAC) x solubility, but the difference was statistically significant only for a comparison of the products for lecithin and olive oil. The values for lecithin were within the range of values produced by biological variation. More important, the correlation of log MAC and log solubility had an average slope of unity (-1.04 +/- 0.07) for lecithin, but a slope differing from unity for benzene (-0.82 +/- 0.05) and olive oil (-0.87 +/- 0.05). We conclude that lecithin is probably more representative of the site of action of these anesthetics than the other solvents.\r"

An aqueous solution of 5% meperidine HCl, 250 micrograms/kg, and an equimolar solution of meperidine dissolved in iophendylate (Pantopaque) were injected subarachnoidally in two groups of rabbits (n = 9 in each) with chronically implanted catheters in the subarachnoid space at the level of L7-8. The effect of each injection was assessed by evaluation of the pain threshold in the animal's hind limbs and of the degree of motor blockade produced. The duration of analgesia and of motor blockade were significantly longer when the lipid solution was used. Six of nine animals that received the aqueous solution of 5% meperidine HCl exhibited temporary signs of agitation (i.e., biting of hind limbs). None of the animals given the lipid solution of the drug did. The findings are attributed to the slow release of meperidine from the lipid phase that serves as a drug depot in the cerebrospinal fluid. The approach presented is suggested as a basis for the development of lipid solutions that might prolong the duration of spinal analgesia produced by a single intrathecal injection.\r"

Mean arterial pressure was reduced 20% to 60-65 mm Hg with use of either isoflurane (less than or equal to 4%), sodium nitroprusside (less than or equal to 8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), or esmolol (less than or equal to 24 mg/min). Esmolol was associated with a decrease in cardiac output from 6.2 +/- 1.3 to 3.8 +/- 0.8 L/min, which, because of a 22% increase in systemic vascular resistance, far exceeded the reduction in mean arterial pressure. Systemic vascular resistance increased despite a 32% decrease in plasma renin activity. In contrast, with sodium nitroprusside or isoflurane, the decrease in mean arterial pressure was associated with decreases in systemic vascular resistance of similar magnitude, with no change in cardiac output. Plasma renin activity levels increased 48% with sodium nitroprusside and 126% with isoflurane. Heart rate increased 13% with sodium nitroprusside, remained unchanged with isoflurane, and decreased 23% with esmolol. Although esmolol may be used as a primary hypotensive agent, the potential for marked myocardial depression must be recognized. The differences in pharmacologic properties for the different hypotensive agents suggest that combinations of these agents may provide a pharmacologic profile superior to either agent alone.\r"

After the induction of general anesthesia, all patients were loaded with 10 mL/kg of a 6% high-molecular dextran solution (Macrodex--Pharmacia), which resulted in a significant preoperative decrease in hematocrit (Hct) from 32% +/- 6% to 28% +/- 5% (hypervolemic hemodilution) and also allowed the procedure to be performed without systemic heparinization. The blood aspirated during the harvest (24 +/- 6 mL/kg; mean +/- SD) was replaced with a solution of 6% dextran and Ringer's acetate solution, and the Hct decreased from 28% +/- 5% to a minimum of 18% +/- 3%. Immediately after the harvest, 10 mL/kg of homologous packed red blood cells was transfused, increasing Hct to 25% +/- 3%. Oxygen saturation in the superior caval vein (ScvO2) decreased from 79% +/- 4% before the harvest to 70% +/- 3% (P less than 0.01) at the end of it, and then increased to 74% +/- 3% after the transfusion of homologous packed red blood cells. There was a strong linear correlation between mean values for Hct and ScvO2 during the various stages (r = 0.99). Mean heart rate decreased gradually during the procedure, from 106 +/- 10 to 86 +/- 7 beats/min. There was no significant change in arterial pressure, but cardiac output measured by impedance cardiography was about 30% greater during harvesting than during undisturbed anesthesia. Pulse oximetric saturation was 99% or 100% throughout. Caval venous blood lactate and pyruvate concentrations remained within normal limits in all children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The current infection control guidelines for anesthesia breathing circuits require single-patient use or high-level disinfection of breathing tubes, y-connector, and reservoir bag. An alternative infection control strategy has been suggested that incorporates placement of a microbial filter downstream from the y-connector between the circuit and the patient. This laboratory study assessed the capacity of the Pall HME Filter as a bidirectional barrier to transmission of bacteria between the y-connector of an anesthesia circle breathing system and a test lung. The investigators modified a sterile circle system to allow aerosolization of a suspension of 10(9) Micrococcus luteus over 5 h into the inspiratory limb proximal to the y-connector or downstream from the filter into the test lung. Cultures indicated that the Pall HME Filter placed between the y-connector and the test lung completely prevented transmission of bacteria in both directions. The results of this study suggest that the Pall HME Filter could be used as an effective microbial barrier between the anesthesia circle breathing system and the patient as part of an alternative strategy for infection control.\r"

Four hours after injection, the subjects consumed a beverage that either did or did not contain 0.7 g/kg of alcohol. Before and 1, 3, 5, and 7 h after injection (and before and 1 and 3 h after beverage consumption), psychomotor performance and mood were assessed. Whereas both midazolam and alcohol alone had effects on the dependent measures in this study, there were no significant interactions between the two drugs (i.e., potentiation of alcohol effects by midazolam or potentiation of midazolam by alcohol). We conclude that the effects of a short-acting benzodiazepine used in ambulatory surgery have probably dissipated by the time a patient arrives home, and that effects from alcohol ingested at home will probably not be influenced by the recent administration of a short-acting benzodiazepine such as midazolam.\r"

Widely recognized as an expert on supplemental oxygen therapy as well as the developer of subcutaneous oxygen as an adjuvant treatment for several chronic diseases, Evans throughout his years of practice held an academic appointment at the University of Buffalo. From that post he tirelessly employed professional political persuasion, combined with a high order of organizational skill, to help create and expand the importance of residency-trained anesthesiologists. As president of the Associated Anesthetists of the United States and Canada, complemented by a quarter-century tour on the International Anesthesia Research Society's Board of Governors, he significantly contributed to the development of anesthesiology into its current form.\r"

After six months of therapy, participants were subjected to coronary arteriography, exercise scintigraphy, exercise electrocardiography, or clinical evaluation. Follow-up evaluation involved 97 coronary lesions in 85 patients. Partial or significant restenosis occurred in 36.5% of patients and 33% of vessels. The presence of severe stenosis before PTCA, dissection, thrombus, multilesion PTCA, and template bleeding time values were not correlated with restenosis. Dilation of the left anterior descending (LAD) and a residual stenosis greater than or equal to 35% were associated with restenosis. Approximately 20% of the patients related difficulty in taking the fish oil. Furthermore, these results show no advantage over expected restenosis rates.\r"

Use of the device produces maximum temperature in excess of 1800 degrees C by convergence of radio-frequency (RF) induced eddy currents in biological tissues. Applications of the EFF probe in angioplasty, aneurysm thrombosis, and neurosurgery have been previously reported. In the present work, the EFF probe was guided under fluoroscopic control and used to occlude renal, splenic, and vertebral arteries in dogs. The occlusion was typically accomplished with about one minute of RF power application. Histology of the treated vessel three to six weeks posttreatment showed total occlusion consisting of intimal and subintimal changes and organized thrombus in the lumen. This suggests that the EFF probe in comparison with other procedures is an inexpensive, relatively safe precision interventional tool for performing an occlusion for experimental and therapeutic purposes.\r"

Baseline venous tone was determined from the pressure: diameter relationships in the inferior vena cava (VSIVC) and femoral vein (VSFV) as measured during several seconds of occlusion of the proximal inferior vena cava. All of the slopes were nearly linear. All vasodilators were administered in dosages sufficient to lower blood pressure by approximately 20%; these dosages also decreased systemic vascular resistance by 15% to 30%. Isosorbide dinitrate reduced VSIVC from 7.17 +/- 0.81 to 5.81 +/- 0.73 mmHg/mm and VSIVC from 59.4 +/- 13.5 to 37.2 +/- 6.6 mmHg/mm. Neither nifedipine nor nisoldipine altered VSIVC or VSFV. However, prazosin decreased VSIVC from 13.2 +/- 3.3 to 10.7 +/- 2.7 mmHg/mm and VSFV from 43.5 +/- 11.3 to 29.9 +/- 8.8 mmHg/mm. These results suggest that isosorbide dinitrate and prazosin decrease venous tone in vivo, whereas nifedipine and nisoldipine do not.\r"

Filtration pressures for both PVD patients and normal subjects showed a cell volume dependency, and patient filtration pressures were normalized to cell volume to evaluate intrinsic, ie, nonvolume dependent, abnormalities in erythrocyte deformability. A significant (p less than 0.001) increase in cell rigidity was found in 44 of 54 PVD patients in comparison with volume-matched normal controls. No significant difference was found between patient mean corpusculer hemoglobin (MCH) and normal MCH at any given mean corpuscular volume (MCV), indicating that observed increases in erythrocyte rigidity are not attributable to changes in patient MCH. Therefore, the mechanism of increase in erythrocyte rigidity for PVD patients still needs further investigation into such parameters as levels of adenosine triphosphate,2,3-DPG, and membrane fluidity (calcium- and/or protein-binding membrane, cholesterol and phospholipid content of membrane, etc), as well as other aspects of erythrocyte physiology.\r"

All patients were hydrated with intravenous fluid (5% dextrose and 0.5 normal saline) over a twelve-hour period prior to catheterization and with oral fluids thereafter.

Hematologically related disorders were diagnosed in 30 (14.1%) patients; the cause of CI could not be established in 25 (11.7%) patients. Fourteen patients (9 men, 5 women, mean age 34.8 years), (6.6%) died within thirty days of their CI: 7 had CEI (7/46,15.2%); 4 had ACI (4/59, 6.7%); and 3 had NAV (3/53, 5.6%). Our data suggest that young patients with acute CI have a thirty-day mortality rate lower than older patients. Deaths were most common in patients with CEI. Brain edema and herniation accounted for 6 (43%) of the deaths.\r"

  ".W": "During operation, biopsies from the gastrocnemius muscle and, in some cases, from the sartorius muscle were taken from 32 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease and from 5 subjects with normal peripheral circulation. In patients with inadequate circulation only during exercise, when compared with the control group, increased activities of enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism (malate dehydrogenase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome C oxidase, creatine kinase), in amino acid metabolism (asparate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase), and in anaerobic glycoysis (lactate dehydrogenase) were found. In patients with circulatory disturbances that manifested themselves already at rest, enzyme activities were, with the exception of LDH, lower than those of patients with exclusively exercise-related insufficiency. By means of intraindividual comparisons with the corresponding enzyme activities in the sartorius muscle, the author was able to show that the changes found were not simply the result of differences in training conditions. The diminished concentrations of energy-rich phosphate are an expression of the anaerobic metabolic state in patients with inadequate circulation at rest. It is concluded that chronic ischemia of muscle leads to changes in the energy metabolism of the cell. In the presence of more nearly adequate circulation at rest, the portion of oxidative potential of the total energy metabolism increases. In contrast, if there is an inadequate circulation at rest, the mainly anaerobic glycolysis becomes quantitatively predominant.\r"

A descending aortogram revealed abnormally dilated right intercostal and bronchial arteries, which formed the anastomosis. The right pulmonary artery was visualized via that anastomosis. Tuberculous pleurisy in the patient's history was considered to be the cause of the anastomosis.

Unfortunately, there is little direct, unequivocal evidence that this is so. Direct evidence will come from studies that test the effectiveness of potent, nontoxic, PAF receptor antagonists in patients with asthma. Another issue that needs to be addressed is the mechanism by which PAF produces bronchoconstriction and, in particular, airway hyperreactivity. Studies exploring the effect of PAF on inflammatory cell populations and functions in the lung, on other mediators (i.e., leukotrienes), and on the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nervous system in human subjects are needed. Finally, identification of the basis for the variable response to PAF in normal subjects and in patients with asthma should provide further insight into PAF's mechanism of action and the pathogenesis of asthma and airway hyperreactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Since the early recognition that leukotrienes are generated in response to allergen exposure, a role for these multipurpose mediators has been sought. The pharmacologic actions of the leukotrienes and their cell sources were strong evidence that they should contribute to allergic airway disease. That promise is now being fulfilled. Potent leukotriene receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors of leukotriene generation are now being investigated. With the availability of these new compounds, not only will greater insight to leukotrienes in asthma become apparent, but possibly newer, more effective therapeutics. Of additional interest and relevance is the potential role of leukotrienes in other nonrespiratory inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. Therefore, the role of leukotrienes in inflammation is not limited to the respiratory system but are more universal in their ability to cause tissue injury. Consequently, studies that have shown benefit from inhibition of leukotriene synthesis and antagonism of the LTD4 receptor in respiratory diseases are suggestive that such an approach will also be beneficial in other inflammatory diseases. For example, a study of 72 patients with A-64077 (zileuton) has demonstrated that 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors are efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, the contribution of leukotrienes to inflammation is likely to be a global phenomenon, and the introduction of leukotriene antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors may represent the beginning of a new era for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotrienes are potent proinflammatory mediators. Our understanding of their role in allergic rhinitis has increased, but further, extensive investigation is required. The sulfidopeptide LTs are generated during the immediate response to antigen provocation and are probably increased during the late inflammatory phase and during seasonal exposure. The source of LTC4 in the early allergic reaction includes the mast cell, but other cell types may also contribute. LTD4 causes nasal congestion and increased blood flow, but not sneezing or significant rhinorrhea. Studies in which LT generation was pharmacologically reduced support a role for these mediators in allergic rhinitis. There is now a need to evaluate the more potent, recently developed, LT antagonists in rhinitis. These agents should help establish the relative importance of LTs to the many other inflammatory mediators that are implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis. Such knowledge will broaden and improve our choice of therapeutic modalities for this disease.\r"

Treatment policy directed that the majority of limited glottic and supraglottic tumors should be treated initially by external irradiation. The small number of glottic treatment failures had a good chance of salvage by vertical partial laryngectomy if recurrence or a new primary was detected early. Recurrence of supraglottic cancer was salvaged occasionally by horizontal partial laryngectomy if strict indications were observed. Total laryngectomy remained the final minority salvage option.\r"

Voice therapy was usually given afterward and in some patients, when necessary, \"fine tuning\" surgery was performed later. The 243 patients who could be located were asked to answer a questionnaire regarding their voice production and communication abilities, and to make a voice recording. The preoperative and long-term postoperative voice recordings were analyzed by means of perceptual voice evaluation and acoustic analysis of the voice spectra. Fifteen percent developed recurrence of mild to moderate spasticity 6 to 24 months after the RLN section. This was curable with laser vocal cord thinning via direct laryngoscopy. Eighty-two percent of patients had little or no voice spasticity 5 to 14 years after their RLN section. The experimental alternative of injecting botulin directly into the vocal cord to temporarily paralyze it is discussed.\r"

Vocal efficiency has been found to decrease with glottic disorders such as vocal cord paralysis and carcinoma. This study compared the effects of vocal fold medialization by surgical augmentation to those of arytenoid adduction on the vocal efficiency, videostroboscopy, and acoustics (jitter, shimmer, and signal-to-noise ratio) of a simulated unilateral vocal cord paralysis in an in vivo canine model. Arytenoid adduction was superior to surgical augmentation in vocal efficiency, traveling wave motion, and acoustics.\r"

The cellular density of the epithelial and mesothelial layers of normal RMs decreased with increasing age. In endolymphatic hydrops, cellular proliferation and decreased cellular density of a distended RM were observed, and these changes occurred more remarkably in epithelial cells. Decreased cellular density in RM was correlated to the degree of endolymphatic hydrops. These findings indicate an involvement of the epithelial cellular changes in the pathogenesis of endolymphatic hydrops. Our results suggest that cellular changes in RM may cause dysfunction of radial flow leading to ionic disturbance of endolymph, which provides a possible mechanism of hearing loss in endolymphatic hydrops.\r"

Symptoms include hearing loss, ataxia, blindness, mental retardation, and seizures. The metabolic defect is an inability to recycle the vitamin biotin, which is an important cofactor in key enzymes. We therefore sought to develop an animal model for this disorder by inducing biotin deficiency. Rat pups were divided into control and experimental groups. Control rats were fed a normal diet whereas experimental animals were given a diet deficient in biotin. Animals from both groups underwent brain stem auditory evoked potential testing at various ages. Wave I thresholds at various ages were similar in both groups. Latencies for wave I, however, and interpeak latencies (I-IV) were prolonged in the biotin-deficient groups compared to controls. Scanning electron microscopy of the organ of Corti in biotin-deficient animals showed no significant hair cell loss. The biotin-deficient developing rat appears to acquire functional changes in the auditory brain stem. These effects may be caused by defective myelination, since biotin is important in fatty acid metabolism.\r"

In addition, using high-density cultures of periotic mesenchyme to model otic capsule formation, we have demonstrated that exogenous TGF-beta 1 can modulate otic chondrogenesis by acting as either an enhancer or a suppressor of this process.

The most common findings were fever, facial pain, and abnormal sinus radiographs. Surveillance cultures of the upper aerodigestive system did not reliably predict sinus pathogens. An aggressive treatment approach consisting of early administration of amphotericin B (intravenously and via catheter irrigations of the sinuses) and surgical drainage is advocated.

  ".W": "Isolates of Mycoplasma hominis collected from patients in Boston and New York between 1976 and 1989 were studied. Minimal metabolism-inhibiting concentrations (MMCs) were determined by use of a terminal color change-broth dilution method, as well as by an agar inoculum-broth dilution method. Both methods gave comparable results. Tetracycline MMCs for 3 (7.0%) of 43 isolates of M. hominis collected from 1976 to 1979 were 8 micrograms/ml or more, but they were 8 micrograms/ml or more for 11 (20.3%) of 54 isolates collected from 1980 to 1983 (P = 0.083) and 16 (26.6%) of 60 isolates collected from 1984 to 1989 (P = 0.019). Similarly, doxycycline MMCs for 0 of 43 isolates of M. hominis collected from 1976 to 1979 were 8 micrograms/ml or more, but they were 8 micrograms/ml or more for 8 (14.8%) of 54 strains isolated from 1980 to 1983 (P = 0.0082) and 10 (16.6%) of 60 strains isolated from 1984 to 1989 (P = 0.0047). The susceptibility of M. hominis to clindamycin did not change. We conclude that isolates of M. hominis in the northeastern United States have become more resistant to tetracycline and doxycycline over the past decade.\r"

Susceptibility tests were done in Middlebrook 7H12B medium with and without Tween 80 and one of the following antimicrobial agents: streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, ciprofloxacin, and penicillin G. Growth responses in the presence of antimicrobial agents led to the following observations. (i) In the absence of Tween, Rg colony types were more resistant than Sm colony types; (ii) the addition of Tween 80 significantly increased the susceptibility of both Sm and Rg colony types; however, the increase was greater with the Sm colony types. These studies showed that the antimicrobial susceptibility of M. paratuberculosis was significantly affected when Tween 80 was present in either the primary culture medium or the drug susceptibility test medium. In the absence of the perturbing influence of Tween 80, M. paratuberculosis was resistant to the antimicrobial agents tested.\r"

Although growth curves indicated that concentrations of 1 microgram or more of pentamidine per ml significantly inhibited the growth of C. albicans, MICs and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were greater than or equal to 10 micrograms/ml. Combinations of ketoconazole and pentamidine did not appear to have any significant effect on MICs or MFCs with most strains. However, the azole-resistant strain exhibited a 2-log decrease in MIC when exposed to ketoconazole combined with 1.0 microgram or more of pentamidine per ml. Similar results were obtained with itraconazole. An Eagle, or paradoxical, effect was observed with four strains exposed to itraconazole alone and in combination with 0.01 and 0.1 microgram of pentamidine per ml. This effect was not seen when concentrations of pentamidine reached 1.0 microgram/ml. Although no fungicidal effect was observed with any of these drugs alone, itraconazole combined with 10 micrograms of pentamidine per ml was fungicidal for eight strains. No signs of antagonism between pentamidine and these two antifungal agents were observed.\r"

The total daily dose was 75 mg/kg of body weight per 24 h in both regimens, given in three doses of 25 mg/kg/8 h (II) or 60 mg/kg/24 h with 15 mg/kg as a loading dose (CI). After the third dose (II) and during CI, serum and blister fluid samples were taken. Seven new blisters were raised for each timed sample by a suction blister technique. Blisters took 90 min to form. Samples were then taken from four blisters (A samples) and 1 h later were taken from the remaining three (B samples). The concentration of ceftazidime was determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography method. After II, the concentrations in serum immediately after infusion (t = 30 min) and 8 h after the start of the infusion were 137.9 (standard deviation [SD], 27.5) and 4.0 (SD, 0.7) micrograms/ml, respectively.

Groups of 20 mice received a subcutaneous injection of 40, 80, or 160 mg of ciprofloxacin or pefloxacin per kg of body weight every 8 h for 3 days. Parasitologic activity was assessed on day 4, and survival was assessed on day 21. Control mice had a fulminant course with a parasitemia of 61.3% +/- 12.1% on day 4, and 90% of the mice were dead on day 21. The lower dosages of pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin (40 and 80 mg/kg) were not efficient. With 160 mg/kg, ciprofloxacin achieved an 85.8% reduction in parasitemia and 17 of 20 mice survived. Pefloxacin achieved a 92.8% reduction in parasitemia, and all mice survived. All treated, noninfected control mice survived. With ciprofloxacin, the antimalarial activity was similar with injections of 240 mg/kg every 12 h but was strongly diminished with injections of 160 mg/kg every 12 h. With pefloxacin, similar activities were observed with injections of 160 mg/kg every 8 h or injections of 160 or 240 mg/kg every 12 h. With both drugs, this activity was highly reduced when the treatment was delayed by 24 h. This underlines the need to provide treatment within the first hours after infection to achieve an optimal effect in this rapidly lethal experimental model of malaria. Pefloxacin and, to a lesser extent, ciprofloxacin are potent antimalarial drugs which might prove useful in the treatment of less rapidly aggressive human malaria.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of nalidixic acid and four fluoroquinolones on DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in the presence and absence of 20 mg of chloramphenicol per liter were examined by comparing the killing kinetics, MIC, morphological response, and maximum concentration to induce recA in Escherichia coli. All agents demonstrated paradoxical killing kinetics, in that above an optimum concentration the rate of bactericidal action was slower. Filamentation of E. coli AB1157 was observed with all quinolones up to the optimum bactericidal concentration. Addition of chloramphenicol reduced the bactericidal activity, inhibited filamentation, and abolished recA induction, but it had no effect on DNA synthesis inhibition by any of the agents. Excellent correlation was obtained between the concentration required to inhibit DNA synthesis by 50%, the MIC, the maximum concentration to induce recA, and the optimum bactericidal concentration. Evidence from this study and previously published data suggest that the primary mechanism of action of quinolones is independent of the SOS response and does not require active protein synthesis; however, induction of recA and SOS responses is consequential and enhances cell death.\r"

Expression of both the HIV protease and the modified Tet protein prevented growth in the presence of tetracycline. However, inhibition of the HIV protease restored tetracycline resistance. Thus, potential HIV protease inhibitors can be identified by their ability to confer tetracycline resistance to this bacterial strain. The assay is simple, rapid, and inexpensive, and this concept can be applied to the search for inhibitors of other viral proteases.\r"

Trospectomycin sulfate (U-63,366F; trospectomycin) or sterile saline was administered to 96 healthy male volunteers in doses ranging from 0.25 ml (75 mg) to 3.3 ml (1,000 mg) in a single intramuscular injection in a double-blind, randomized design. Volunteers were screened to establish baseline vital signs and laboratory test values. Pain and tenderness at the injection site, which occurred at doses of 450 mg and above, were the most common side effects; they were mild in severity and transient. Adverse drug experiences reported by subjects included nausea, dizziness, light-headedness, diaphoresis, costal pain, and perioral numbness. The perioral numbness (paresthesia) experienced at doses of 750, 900, and 1,000 mg was probably drug related. No Clostridium difficile toxin was detected in fecal samples. Pharmacokinetic calculations based on data obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography showed that after a 1,000-mg intramuscular dose of trospectomycin (3.3 ml), the serum mean half-life was 1.85 h (1.70 to 2.02 h), mean area under the serum concentration-time curve was 140.2 micrograms.h/ml and was linear with dose, mean peak concentration was 28.3 micrograms/ml (20.4 to 34.7 micrograms/ml), mean time to maximum concentration was 71 min (30 to 120 min), and the elimination rate constant was 0.307 h-1. The elimination rate constant and half-life did not vary with dose. Little trospectomycin was detected in 2-day fecal collections. A few randomly occurring abnormal clinical laboratory test values and vital signs were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo efficacy of daptomycin, a new cell wall-active anti-gram-positive-bacterial agent, was compared to those of cloxacillin and vancomycin in a rat model of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains were used. When therapy was initiated early (8 h) after infection, at the time when valvular bacterial counts were relatively low (approximately 10(6) CFU/g of vegetation), 3 days of therapy was found to be effective against the MSSA strains whatever the antibiotic regimen. In contrast, when the onset of therapy was delayed up to 15 h after infection, so that higher bacterial counts could develop on the valves (approximately 10(9) CFU/g of vegetation), a longer period of treatment (6 days) was required to cure infection. Under these conditions after 3 days of therapy, daptomycin was more effective than cloxacillin and vancomycin against the MSSA strains. Similarly, daptomycin showed a greater activity than vancomycin against the MRSA strain after 3 days of treatment, but after 6 days both antibiotics were equally effective. Decreasing doses of daptomycin showed decreasing activity: 10 mg/kg of body weight every 12 h (q12h) was better than 5 mg/kg q12h, whereas 5 mg/kg q24h (providing drug levels in blood detectable only during the first 12 h) failed to cure infection. In vitro, daptomycin was highly bactericidal at high concentrations (25 and 60 micrograms/ml, corresponding to peak levels in serum after doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and bacteriostatic at lower concentrations (0.5 to 2.5 micrograms/ml, corresponding to trough levels in serum).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Doses of each regimen were given preoperatively. Serum, bile fluid, and gallbladder wall tissue samples of consecutive patients in the ofloxacin group were obtained intraoperatively. The samples were frozen at -70 degrees C until analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Twenty-three patients (6 males and 17 females) were evaluated. The mean (+/- the standard deviation) ofloxacin concentrations in serum, bile fluid, and gallbladder wall tissue were 2.9 +/- 2.4 and 6.0 +/- 7.9 micrograms/ml and 3.1 +/- 2.9 micrograms/g, respectively. The mean number of doses each patient received before surgery was 5.3 +/- 3.0, and the mean delta time (time elapsed between last antibiotic administration and when intraoperative samples were obtained) was 9.6 +/- 7.5 h.

  ".W": "The comparative pharmacokinetics and in vivo production of N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT) were evaluated following administration of cefoperazone, cefotetan, and cefmetazole. In a randomized-crossover manner, 11 healthy male volunteers received single 2-g intravenous doses of each agent and serial blood and urine samples were collected. Concentrations of NMTT and the parent compound in plasma, urine, and the reconstituted antibiotic solution were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The amounts of NMTT administered were 6.06 +/- 0.46, 14.4 +/- 0.87, and 17.4 +/- 1.06 mg for cefoperazone, cefotetan, and cefmetazole, respectively (P less than 0.05). The mean NMTT plasma concentration-time profiles following administration of each cephalosporin were markedly different. Six hours after dosing, NMTT concentrations in plasma following cefoperazone administration were higher than those following administration of cefmetazole and cefotetan. Urinary recoveries of NMTT averaged 137.0 +/- 37.1, 38.3 +/- 6.98, and 25.2 +/- 5.95 mg following administration of cefoperazone, cefotetan, and cefmetazole, respectively (P less than 0.01). The apparent amount of NMTT produced in vivo, calculated by subtracting the amount of NMTT administered from the amount of NMTT excreted in urine, was significantly lower following cefmetazole administration than after administration of cefoperazone and cefotetan (P less than 0.01). The discrepancy between in vitro NMTT production (cefmetazole greater than cefotetan greater than cefoperazone) and the amount of NMTT formed in vivo and excreted unchanged (cefoperazone greater than cefotetan greater than cefmetazole) suggests that in vivo production of NMTT is dependent on the disposition of the parent cephalosporin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 35 patients enrolled, 26 had osteomyelitis, 8 had vascular-access-associated bacteremias, and 1 had a joint infection. A total of 38 gram-positive isolates were identified: 23 Staphylococcus aureus and 6 coagulase-negative staphylococcus and 9 streptococcus isolates. After at least 6 months of follow-up, 17 patients were evaluable for efficacy: 10 of 14 (71%) with osteomyelitis and 3 of 3 with vascular-access-associated bacteremias had full resolution of their infections. Inadequate debridement, the presence of metal, and inadequate dosing were likely causes of two failures and two relapses in patients with osteomyelitis. For all but two organisms, teicoplanin MICs were less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Patients who responded had median peak and trough serum bactericidal levels at serum dilutions of 1:64 and 1:16; trough levels of teicoplanin in serum were greater than 30 micrograms/ml. Patients did not respond as expected to daily doses of 4 mg/kg of body weight, which consequently were increased to greater than or equal to 15 mg/kg. Audiology testing of 20 patients found 2 with a mild loss of high-frequency hearing; 1 patient complained of tinnitus. Patients tolerated peak levels in serum as high as 127 micrograms/ml and trough levels of 49 micrograms/ml. However, 5 of 18 patients (28%) whose daily dose was greater than or equal to 12 mg/kg developed drug fever and rash and had teicoplanin discontinued. Further study of the antibiotic at such higher doses is needed.\r"

Subjects were middle-aged to elderly (mean age +/- standard deviation, 69.8 +/- 8.2 years) with normal hepatic function and with creatinine clearances ranging from 35.8 to 141 ml/min/1.73 m2. Lomefloxacin was administered in 400-mg doses orally every 24 h. Its disposition was characterized following the third dose by obtaining multiple serum samples and intraoperative paired central zone and peripheral zone prostate tissue samples. Lomefloxacin concentrations were determined by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection. Concentrations in serum during the perioperative period declined from 3.1 +/- 1.0 mg/liter (mean +/- standard deviation) at 1 h postdose to 2.3 +/- 0.7 mg/liter at 6 h postdose. The time of tissue extraction ranged from 0.1 to 7.1 h postdose. Intraoperative serum lomefloxacin concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 4.8 (median, 2.4) mg/liter, while prostate tissue concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 10.1 (median, 5.4) mg/kg of tissue for the central zone and 0.9 to 6.5 (median, 5.2) mg/kg for the peripheral zone. Intraindividual paired prostate concentrations (central zone versus peripheral zone) were not statistically different. The partition coefficient (ratio of concentration in prostate to concentration in serum) for the central zone was 2.2 +/- 0.6 (range, 1.2 to 3.1), and for the peripheral zone it was 2.1 +/- 0.7 (range, 1.2 to 4.2). Lomefloxacin exhibited good penetration into the human prostate with homogeneous intraprostatic distribution following multiple-dose administration.\r"

  ".W": "The toxicity of Cd2+ in Escherichia coli K-12 was potentiated by salicylate and several related compounds. The efficiency of plating on Luria broth plates was reduced by more than 10(5)-fold when 10 mM salicylate and 200 microM CdCl2 were present simultaneously but was unaffected when either compound was present by itself. Synergistic effects were found at pH 7.4 with certain other weak acids (acetyl salicylate [aspirin], benzoate, and cinnamate) and with a nonacidic salicylate analog, salicyl alcohol, but not with acetate or p-hydroxy benzoate. Thus, the synergism with Cd2+ is determined by the structure of the compounds and not merely by their acidity. The kinetics of 109Cd2+ uptake by cells grown and assayed in broth indicated the presence of two uptake systems with Kms of 1 and 52 microM Cd2+ and Vmaxs of 0.059 and 1.5 mumol of Cd2+ per min per g of cells, respectively. The kinetics of uptake for cells grown and assayed with 20 mM salicyl alcohol showed 2.5-fold increases in the Vmaxs of both systems but no change in the Kms. Salicylate-grown cells also exhibited increased rates of 109Cd2+ uptake by both systems. Thus, enhanced uptake of Cd2+ may be responsible for the potentiation of Cd2+ toxicity by salicylate and salicyl alcohol.\r"

  ".U": "91207035\r", 
  ".W": "To enhance the antimicrobial spectrum of the quinolones against anaerobic organisms and gram-positive bacteria, we investigated in two studies the parenteral combinations of ciprofloxacin (200 mg) and ofloxacin (200 mg) with metronidazole (500 mg) or clindamycin (600 mg) and the oral combinations of enoxacin (400 mg) and fleroxacin (400 mg) with metronidazole (400 mg), clindamycin (300 mg), or ornidazole (500 mg) (only with fleroxacin). The pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) against 5 aerobic and 2 anaerobic species (total, 58 strains) were determined in two groups of 10 healthy volunteers by using a randomized crossover study design. The additions of metronidazole, clindamycin, and ornidazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the quinolones. The combination of clindamycin with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and, to a lesser extent, fleroxacin resulted in an increase of the SBA against gram-positive strains (mean peak titers): Staphylococcus aureus, ciprofloxacin alone, 1:5.5; ciprofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:19.9; ofloxacin alone, 1:3.6; ofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:17.5; fleroxacin alone, 1:4.3; fleroxacin-clindamycin, 1:8.1; Streptococcus pneumoniae (fleroxacin and enoxacin were not tested), ciprofloxacin alone, 1:2.0; ciprofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:53; ofloxacin alone, 1:2.6; and ofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:49.2. The high SBA of quinolones against gram-negative bacteria was not affected by the combinations; however, relatively low activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected. In general, against anaerobic bacteria, low bactericidal activities were determined in both studies (mean peak titers ranged from 1:2.1 to 1:3.1; mean trough titers range from 1:2.0 to 1:2.9). In clinical settings with severe mixed infections, a parenteral therapy consisting of modern quinolones together with clindamycin or imidazole derivatives seems to be active and offers no obvious interactions.\r"

On four separate occasions, subjects received ofloxacin alone or antacid 24 h before, 2 h before, or 2 h after ofloxacin administration (n = 16 for each antacid). CC administration had no significant effect on the rate and extent of ofloxacin absorption regardless of the timing of antacid administration. A small but significant negative effect of MAH administration 2 h before ofloxacin administration was noted as evidenced by area under the curve and peak concentration in plasma data. Simultaneous administration of ofloxacin with either antacid was not investigated in this study. It appears that MAH and CC antacids in the doses used in this study generally do not interfere in a clinically significant manner with the bioavailability of ofloxacin, provided that an interval of at least 2 h separates the administration of these products.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the vasoconstriction in Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with raised concentrations of the endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor endothelin (ET-1), responses to cold pressor testing were examined in 7 subjects with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and in 7 control subjects. Baseline serum ET-1 levels (pg/ml), as measured by radioimmunoassay, were three times higher in Raynaud's subjects (5.3 [SEM 1.7] pg/ml) than in controls (1.7 [0.3]). With progressive local cooling digital arterial pulsatility, as measured by plethysmography, fell earlier and to a greater extent in Raynaud's subjects than in controls, with a half-maximum decrement in pulsatility occurring at 27 [2.6] degrees C and 18 [0.5] degrees C, respectively. Temperature reduction sufficient to cause loss of pulsatility in the Raynaud's subjects produced increases in ET-1 concentrations in both groups that were greater in Raynaud's (10.3 [4.4] pg/ml) than in control subjects (2.7 [0.9] pg/ml). Serum ET-1 in the contralateral arm rose in parallel to but to a lesser extent than that in the cold-challenged arm. Increases in ET-1 concentrations were temporally related to loss of pulsatility but followed the onset of symptoms. Thus the increased basal and stimulated serum endothelin concentrations in Raynaud's disease are associated with the enhanced, prolonged vasospasm of this disorder.\r"

The enzyme activity declines steadily with age over a range from 18 to 90 years with a statistically significant fall of 25% over this period. Since this decline is apparent whether or not thiamin diphosphate is added in vitro to activate the apoenzyme, the activation ratios are independent of the age effect. The decline is seen in both sexes in patients and normal subjects. It is concluded that the reliability of the specific transketolase activity as an indicator of marginal thiamin deficiency will be improved if the results are expressed as a percentage of the mean normal value corrected for age with values less than 60% of the age adjusted mean taken to indicate possible deficiency.\r"

Three-dimensional analysis of the dendritic arborizations showed an age-dependent increase in several dendritic parameters, but a net stability was found in the metrical parameters between alcohol-fed and respective control rats. Conversely, a dendritic impoverishment occurred in the withdrawal group. The linear density of dendritic spines remained stable in all groups studied. Together with the previously found marked loss of the neurons after alcohol consumption and withdrawal, these findings point to a decrease in the available targets for afferents and therefore to the presence of probable functional alterations as a consequence of those in the connectivity patterns of the prelimbic area occurring under these conditions.\r"

The specificity of the binding sites is confirmed by the effective competition of the corresponding unlabeled PGs with 3H-PGs for binding sites on receptors. The modification of liver plasma membranes by acetaldehyde drastically decreases the density of the binding sites, leaving unaffected the affinity of receptors. To bind PGF2 alpha, liver plasma membranes have two types of binding sites, strong and weak ones. The alkylation of membranes by acetaldehyde does not essentially change the PGF2 alpha binding parameters. It is suggested that the protective effect of PGs in alcoholic liver injury occurs by their competition with acetaldehyde for binding sites on specific PG-binding receptors of liver plasma membranes.\r"

  ".W": "1. The relative sensitivity of heart, small intestine and skeletal muscle to chronic ethanol feeding was investigated in mature Wistar rats fed ethanol as 36% of total energy intake; controls were fed the same diet in which ethanol was substituted by isoenergetic glucose. 2. Chronic ethanol feeding had no apparent effect on the protein, RNA and DNA contents of heart homogenates (atria and ventricles). The ratios of RNA/protein (synthetic capacity), RNA/DNA (synthetic material per nucleus) and protein/DNA (DNA-unit or apparent cell size) were also unaltered in the hearts of alcohol-fed rats. Fractional rates of cardiac protein synthesis (ks), and synthesis relative to RNA (kRNA) and DNA (kDNA) and absolute rates of protein synthesis (Vs) were unaffected by ethanol feeding. The total content of cardiac soluble proteins was unaltered by chronic ethanol feeding, but there were small and statistically significant decreases in the contents of the myofibrillar and stromal protein fractions. There were no differences in ks in any of the cardiac subcellular protein fractions. 3. In the small intestine, ethanol feeding had no statistically significant effect on either protein or RNA contents, but there was an apparent increase in RNA when expressed relative to either protein or DNA, though the DNA-unit was unaltered. There were also substantial decreases in ks, kRNA, kDNA and Vs of approximately 15-35%. 4. In the gastrocnemius, RNA contents were significantly reduced by ethanol feeding but protein and DNA contents were unaffected. Indices of the synthetic capacity and synthetic material per nucleus were also reduced, but the DNA-unit was unaltered. These observations were accompanied by approx. 15-30% reductions in ks, kRNA, kDNA and Vs in response to ethanol feeding. 5. It is concluded that various aspects of protein metabolism in the heart, small intestine and skeletal muscle are adversely affected by chronic ethanol toxicity. The characteristics and magnitude of the responses in each tissue differ. Effects in the heart may be subtle, though haemodynamic indices may ensue. The ethanol-induced alterations in the small intestine and skeletal muscle may be responsible for gastrointestinal disturbances in motility and skeletal muscle weakness, respectively.\r"

  ".U": "91207505\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms by which ethanol inhibits testicular testosterone synthesis in rats were studied in vitro using isolated rat Leydig cells. The ethanol-induced inhibition was reversed by 4-methylpyrazole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, suggesting that ethanol metabolism was responsible for this inhibition. L-glutamate and pyruvate, when added to the Krebs-Ringer incubation medium, reversed the inhibition by ethanol. The membrane glutamate receptor agonists kainic acid and quisqualic acid had no effects, indicating metabolic mechanisms for the L-glutamate action. This was verified also by observations that the metabolic transaminase inhibitors aminooxyacetate and cycloserine inhibited testosterone synthesis. In the amino acid supplemented Krebs-Ringer, pyruvate could not fully prevent inhibition by ethanol alone, but addition of L-glutamate to this medium abolished ethanol-induced inhibition. Experiments performed using a new inhibitor of testosterone biosynthesis in intact Leydig cells, triethylcitrate, indicated that active citrate metabolism, and/or efflux from mitochondria, was essential for the steroidogenic pathway from pregnenolone to testosterone in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The early steps of hCG stimulation before pregnenolone formation were most sensitive to its effect. Our results indicate that the inhibition of steroidogenesis by ethanol results from decreased availability of the metabolites involved in the substrate shuttles maintaining the NAD(P)H redox states between the mitochondrial and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum compartments, and that the inhibition can be overcome by a proper selection of exogenous sources for these metabolites.\r"

  ".U": "91207506\r", 
  ".W": "Several studies have recently shown the presence of antibodies against acetaldehyde-modifications in the sera of alcoholic patients. To assess the specificity of this immune response, plasma immunoreactivity with proteins modified in vitro by acetaldehyde was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 97 alcoholic patients with varying degrees of alcoholic liver disease, in 35 patients with non-alcoholic liver diseases and in 33 control subjects who were social drinkers. All three groups showed some response against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes. The highest plasma reactivities were found in alcoholics, especially those with steatosis and alcoholic hepatitis. Plasma from patients with non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects also reacted with the acetaldehyde conjugates, but to a lesser extent than plasma from alcoholics. The reliability of these antibodies as markers of either alcohol abuse or alcoholic liver disease therefore appears to be low. However, further studies using more precisely modified proteins or elucidation of the classes of immunoglobulin involved in the immune response against the modified proteins may give clearer differences between the three groups.\r"

A second control group received no intragastric solution and all groups received chow and water ad libitum. Parotid saliva elicited by pilocarpine was collected by unilateral duct cannulation. The parotid flow rate over the initial post-stimulatory five minute period was raised by 44% in ethanol-dosed rats and the salivary sodium concentration was also raised, in line with higher flow rate. There were no histopathological changes related to ethanol or sucrose dosing, but stereological analysis showed a 64% increase in the proportional volume of intralobular vascular tissue in ethanol-dosed rats. These quantified histological findings suggest that parotid intralobular haemodynamics may be altered after chronic ethanol-dosing and this may contribute to the hypersecretory response exhibited by the ethanol-dosed rats.\r"

LDL composition was determined in 16 alcohol addicts immediately after a period of alcohol abuse. Cholesterol to apo B ratio in the LDL fraction was significantly higher in the alcoholic group when compared with controls. In half of them the ratio exceeded 1.75. LDL subfractionation showed that in all subjects with atypically high LDL cholesterol to apolipoprotein B ratio, most of the LDL was in the form of a light subfraction. Acetylation in vitro showed that the heavy LDL subfraction was modified to a greater extent than the light subfraction. This suggests that the low apo B levels often observed after heavy drinking may arise from enhanced removal of the heavy LDL subfraction from the bloodstream.\r"

  ".U": "91207510\r", 
  ".W": "Alcohol is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Britain. Consultation, questionnaires and laboratory tests may all be used to help identify alcohol abuse and thereby prevent and treat alcohol-related problems. Consultation which can identify 80% of alcohol abusers involves recording the findings of alcohol and general histories and physical examination. The accuracy of the assessment depends on the reliability of the respondent and the respondent's relations and friends, and on the skill of the investigator; however, thorough assessment is time-consuming and expensive. Questionnaires may identify up to 80% of alcoholics. They are generally based on the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test and CAGE questionnaires and are simple, rapid to complete, inexpensive and not dependent on skilled investigators; however, the principal disadvantage of using questionnaires is that a personal relationship is not developed with the subject. Finally, simple and complex laboratory tests may be used. Of the simple laboratory tests, raised GGT or MCV levels are the most useful and when these values are combined, 90% of alcoholics may be identified correctly. Complex laboratory tests may exhibit greater sensitivity and specificity and provide useful additional information; however, their restricted availability limits their widespread use. The value of each of these methods depends on the objective of the assessment. For population surveys, questionnaires are of greatest relative value and consultation and laboratory tests may be used to confirm the presence of alcohol abuse. In general practice and the hospital setting, it is imperative to include questions on alcohol intake and alcohol-related problems in all interviews with patients. Laboratory tests may be used to confirm suspected alcohol abuse and questionnaires may provide useful screening tools. Finally, in the specialist alcohol unit, consultation, questionnaires and laboratory investigations are all important for identifying alcohol abuse. In this setting, consultation is of particular importance and the alcohol history and physical examination should be recorded by a skilled investigator and the results confirmed with relatives and close friends. Questionnaires are useful as initial screening or assessment tools and computer-based systems may facilitate data collection. Simple and complex laboratory tests may be used to confirm the diagnosis and help ascertain the extent of disease. By assuming that 'all patients have alcohol-related problems until proven otherwise', and through the appropriate application of consultation, questionnaires and laboratory tests, identification of excessive alcohol consumption and the prevention of its sequelae will be facilitated.\r"

Psychoactive substance use disorder in accordance with DSM-III-R was present in 47% of the youth suicides investigated, predominantly as alcohol dependence. Substance use disorder often coexisted with a borderline personality disorder or schizophrenia. Secondary depression was a frequent final factor. Dependence had developed in all females and most males. The median duration of substance use was 9 years. Substance use preceded suicidal behaviour by two years. Exposure to parental substance misuse during childhood, early parental divorce and parasuicide in the family were more frequent among subjects with substance use disorder than among other subjects. The social situation was often characterized by unemployment and legal problems. Previous inpatient care was more common than among other subjects.\r"

Over a 2-year study period, 48 patients met inclusion criteria. Radiographs of all digits were taken to detect distal phalangeal fracture and SUH size was measured. Nail trephination was performed using electrocautery, and all patients reported relief of pain after the procedure. Follow-up was achieved in 45 of 48 patients with a total of 47 SUH. Average follow-up period was 10.3 +/- 4.3 months. By patient history, average time for the nail to grow back was 4.0 +/- 2.6 months. No complications of infection, osteomyelitis, or major nail deformities occurred in any patients treated by nail trephination, regardless of SUH size or presence of fracture. In simple SUH, regardless of size, nail removal with suture repair of the nail bed, as suggested in previous studies, is unnecessary.\r"

EMS records on all 434 patients in the period from August 1, 1986, to July 31, 1987, were reviewed. Most patients had minor problems. Overall, 77% of patients contacting the EMS system were released at the scene, and base hospital contact was made in only 28% of cases. However, there were three deaths, 44 (10%) patients who received advanced life support, and 292 (67%) patients who received basic life support. Seven patients who received advanced life support were released without transport. Decisions regarding scope of practice in a low-volume, wilderness EMS system are complicated by long transport times and problems with skills maintenance. Differences between the times and problems with skills maintenance. Differences between the patients treated by a wilderness system and those seen in most urban systems may make it appropriate to release a greater portion of patients without ambulance transport. In a system with long response and transport times, use of personnel with different training than in the urban setting becomes necessary.\r"

Eighteen emergency medicine personnel were prospectively studied. Sequential measurements of heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, skin temperature, serum norepinephrine, and serum epinephrine were recorded during multiple shifts in the emergency department. These parameters were assessed in repeated measures analysis of variance models with the subject's stress score of the shift and a calculated stress score of the shift. Respiratory rate demonstrated a significant association with the score of the shift over time within subjects (P = .0228). Skin temperature showed a significant trend over time (P = .0001) and in relation to how stressful the subject perceived the shift to be (P = .0006). A significant association was detected between epinephrine change over the shift and the subject's perception of the stress of the shift (P = .0217), and the stress score of the shift (P = .0009). Sequential serum epinephrine appears to be an objective measure of both perceived stressfulness of a shift and objective stress scoring of the shift. Respiratory rate changes and skin temperature changes over a shift may also be useful to measure stress in individuals in this setting.\r"

  ".W": "A case of massive bilateral diaphragmatic rupture following a low impact motor vehicle accident is described. The patient experienced herniation of intraabdominal contents into the thoracic cavity, but suffered no additional injuries. Few cases of bilateral diaphragmatic rupture have been reported and no cases of acute bilateral rupture have been described as an isolated injury. Diaphragmatic rupture in general may be a difficult injury to recognize. Based on our review of recent cases of diaphragmatic rupture (1979-1990), most patients presenting acutely have additional trauma (89.9%) but only vague symptoms related to their diaphragmatic insult. A chest roentgenogram may be a useful diagnostic tool, although many patients with diaphragmatic rupture have only nonspecific findings. A nasogastric tube placed prior to chest roentgenogram may enable the physician to recognize the injury more readily. A high index of suspicion is required to recognize diaphragmatic rupture and should be maintained for all victims of motor vehicle accidents with abnormal but nondiagnostic chest roentgenograms.\r"

The literature varies greatly as to the care of patients with presumed spontaneous pneumomediastinum. The authors present an illustrative case of spontaneous pneumomediastinum treated with intravenous antibiotics and intensive care unit (ICU) admission despite a normal esophagram. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a benign entity that may not require observation in an ICU, and patients may do as well with close outpatient follow-up. For those patients in which the etiology of the pneumomediastinum is unclear, a contrast esophagram is recommended to assess for esophageal disruption. The signs, symptoms, pathophysiology, and disposition of spontaneous pneumomediastinum are discussed.\r"

Following a latent period of approximately 12 hours, the patient developed cyanide poisoning with severe metabolic acidosis, seizures, and shallow respirations. She responded to the administration of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate, although the administration of nitrite produced bradycardia and hypotension. She developed several relapses over the course of her hospitalization and each time responded to sodium thiosulfate administration. The patient developed hypernatremia from the sodium load given to her; hemodialysis and charcoal hemoperfusion were initiated to correct the hypernatremia and to attempt to remove cyanide, thiocyanate, and acetonitrile. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was fully recovered and was discharged.\r"

Hours later, the onset of clinical toxicity was heralded by mental status abnormalities and vomiting prior to a generalized seizure. Following administration of sodium thiosulfate, the patient made an uneventful recovery. A blood cyanide level drawn shortly after presentation, but reported after the patient had been discharged, documented significant exposure. During hospitalization, cyanide toxicity was inferred from the history of ingestion of acetonitrile, plus a significant absence of venous blood hemoglobin desaturation. Because even small amounts can be harmful and toxicity is delayed, all acetonitrile ingestions should be presumed dangerous. Patients should be observed and repeatedly evaluated for at least 24 hours. In the absence of cyanide level determinations, lethargy, vomiting, seizures, and the lack of normal venous blood hemoglobin desaturation are clues to cyanide toxicity.\r"
