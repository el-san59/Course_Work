The findings support a relation between acute appendicitis and Western hygiene, which would explain the geographical distribution of the disease and its changing incidence over time. In the developing world, where children grow up in conditions of poor hygiene, there may be outbreaks of appendicitis when housing improves.\r"

One third of these women had operationally defined sexual dysfunction: impaired sexual interest was identified in 17% of women (68/406), vaginal dryness in 17% (73/434), infrequency of orgasm in 16% (60/379), and dyspareunia in 8% (30/379). Sexual dysfunctions were statistically significantly associated with increasing age and also with psychiatric disorder, neuroticism, and marital disharmony. One in 10 women regarded themselves as having a sexual problem. These women were no older than women with sexual dysfunction who did not regard themselves as having a sexual problem. Nevertheless, they differed from the rest of the sample in having more psychiatric disorder, neuroticism, marital disharmony, and (in women still menstruating) psychological symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome. In the whole sample 16 women (4%) said that they would like help for a sexual problem. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction in this series of women suggests that general practitioners should increase their alertness to the problem in their patients.\r"

  ".W": "Low maternal weight before pregnancy and poor weight gain during pregnancy are known to result in an increased prevalence of low birthweight infants. Low body weight is also an important cause of amenorrhoea. The hypothesis that amenorrhoeic underweight women who become pregnant after induction of ovulation are more at risk of delivering low birthweight infants than underweight women who ovulate spontaneously was investigated. Forty one pregnant women in whom ovulation had been induced and 1212 in whom ovulation was spontaneous were studied. Women ovulating spontaneously whose weight was normal and who showed good weight gain during pregnancy (greater than 450 g a week) had the lowest incidence (6%) of babies who were small for gestational age. Underweight women (body mass index less than 19.1) who ovulated spontaneously had a threefold increased risk of delivering babies who were small for gestational age (18%). Overall, the women in whom ovulation had been induced had an even higher risk of babies who were small for dates (25%), and the risk was greatest (54%) in those who were underweight. The outcome of pregnancy is related to weight before conception, which in many cases reflects nutritional state; lack of spontaneous ovulation indicates an increased risk of producing a small for dates infant. The most suitable treatment for infertility secondary to weight related amenorrhoea is therefore dietary rather than induction of ovulation.\r"

  ".U": "88193744\r", 
  ".W": "The clinical effects of routinely imaging the renal tract (by intravenous urography and ultrasonography) were evaluated prospectively in 128 consecutive patients with prostatism. Patients with haematuria, previous renal disease, or infection were excluded. Urologists completed a standard questionnaire in the patient's notes stating the diagnosis and the intended management. The patient then had intravenous urography and abdominal ultrasonography, urine was analysed, and plasma urea and serum creatinine concentrations and acid phosphatase activity were determined. From six months to a year later the eventual management was compared with the intended management to see the effect of these routine investigations on the outcome. For four out of 28 patients whose management was intended to be conservative the decision was changed; for only three of them was this because of the results of urography, ultrasonography, and biochemical determinations. For 31 patients the management was to be decided by cystoscopic findings, and for none of these was the final decision altered by the results from the investigations after the initial consultation. Similarly for five patients who were assessed urodynamically the final management was not changed by the results of these investigations. The planned management was changed in three of the remaining 64 patients but not because of the results of the initial investigations. Thus no indication was found for either routine urography or ultrasonography, but the total abandonment of imaging of the renal tract would be unwise. Patients scheduled for conservative management (about a quarter of the patients in this study) should have ultrasonography to detect unsuspected hydronephrosis, but in all other patients urography or ultrasonography, or both, is an unhelpful ritual. Moreover, urography is becoming more expensive, and has a recognised (albeit small) mortality.\r"

Two thirds were treated continuously with 400 mg at bedtime supplemented by temporary increases in dosage if they had symptomatic relapses (group 1), and the remaining third were given intermittent \"healing\" doses for four to eight weeks if a symptomatic recurrence was judged to have occurred (group 2). Life table analysis showed that the probability of remaining free of clinically important symptoms five years after the start of treatment was 24% (95% confidence interval (CI) 15.5% to 32.6%) in group 1 compared with nil in group 2 (p less than 0.0001). The median values for the longest periods free from relapse for each patient were 108 weeks in group 1 and 32 weeks in group 2, respectively (p less than 0.0001; 95% CI of the median difference 36 to 76). Over the five years 10 patients suffered major complications, two requiring emergency surgery, while a further nine had elective surgery because of the failure of medical treatment. There were no deaths that could be attributed either to ulceration or to treatment with cimetidine. Medical management was therefore very satisfactory for most patients, though those treated continuously with cimetidine suffered considerably less from their ulcer symptoms. As 80% of patients studied relapsed during the two years after a healing course of cimetidine, continuous treatment will benefit many patients treated in general practice.\r"

  ".W": "A screening programme to detect preinvasive carcinoma of the cervix was started in British Columbia in 1949. Since 1970 the number of women who have been screened at least once has been maintained at about 85% of the population at risk. More than 500,000 cervical smears are being examined each year in the central laboratory. There has been an appreciable increase in the number of cases and rates of carcinoma in situ seen since 1970, particularly in women between 20 and 30 years of age. Since the programme started over 26,000 cases of squamous carcinoma in situ have been detected and treated. The incidence of clinically invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix has fallen by 78% during the period under review, and mortality from squamous carcinoma of the cervix has fallen by 72%. A colposcopy programme, introduced throughout British Columbia over the past 12 years, has been important in reducing the problems of managing preinvasive lesions, particularly in younger women. It is concluded that the reduction in morbidity and mortality from invasive squamous cancer of the cervix in British Columbia over the past 30 years is directly attributable to the province wide screening programme and that a large potential increase in invasive cervical cancer rates among younger women is being prevented.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1977 and 1985 there was a 65% increase in births to women aged 35 or more in England and Wales, but only a 15% increase in all births. Two factors of roughly equal importance were responsible for this differential increase. Firstly, the proportion of older women (35-44) among all women of reproductive age (15-44) increased from 28% in 1977 to 31% in 1985; and, secondly, in the same period the fertility rate for women aged 35-39 increased from 18.2 to 24.1 per 1000 and for women aged 40-44 from 4.1 to 4.6 per 1000. The increased fertility rate among older women is not due to an extension of the reproductive period but to a delay in childbearing. This delay was seen in women married only once and also in those who had remarried. As prenatal diagnosis for the exclusion of chromosome abnormalities is customarily offered to older mothers the increased numbers of women aged 35 or more and their increased fertility rate have important implications for the provision of obstetric and laboratory services. There were 51,859 live births to women aged 35 and over in 1985; the projected figure for 2001 is 85,000. If the use of prenatal diagnosis continues to increase facilities for about 70,000 prenatal cytogenetic analyses will be needed in 2001.\r"

  ".W": "Of 1,245 patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy for Stage I and II breast cancers, 118 required a secondary operation subsequently for apparently isolated recurrence in the treated breast. Fifty-two of these 118 patients were selected for salvage treatment with wide excision, with or without axillary dissection, instead of resorting to mastectomy. With a median follow-up of 6 years, the actuarial cancer-specific survival (Kaplan-Meier) after treatment of recurrence was 79% at 5 years and 64% at 10 years. The probability of local control in the treated breast was 79% at 5 years after conservative salvage surgery. Of 12 patients in whom second local or regional recurrences developed, ten could be treated by further surgery. We concluded from this experience that wedge excision represents an adequate alternative to mastectomy in the salvage treatment of isolated breast recurrences that are mobile, 2 cm or smaller in diameter, and without signs of rapid growth.\r"

  ".W": "In order to assess the efficacy of high-dose irradiation to the posterior fossa and low-dose irradiation to the spinal axis, we reviewed the results of 60 patients with biopsy-proven medulloblastoma treated at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy (JCRT) between 1968 and 1984. The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates for all patients were 68% and 44%, respectively. The median time to recurrence was 19 months. Extent of surgery, age, and radiation dose to the posterior fossa all were of prognostic value. Complete or subtotal gross resection appeared to be a favorable prognostic indicator compared with biopsy only (P less than 0.05), with a 69% versus 40% actuarial survival rate at 5 years, respectively. Infants 2 years of age or less had a diminished 5-year actuarial survival rate of 48% (P less than 0.05) compared with older age groups. The posterior fossa was the predominant site of recurrence and accounted for 78% of all failures. Local control in the posterior fossa was dose dependent. Seventy-nine percent of the tumors that received 5000 cGy or greater were controlled versus only 33% of the tumors that received less than 5000 cGy (P less than 0.02). There were no supratentorial failures, and there was only one isolated spinal cord failure. There were no solitary spinal failures in 24 patients who received a median dose of only 2400 cGy to the spinal axis. We concluded that low-dose irradiation to the spine and whole brain may be indicated with maintenance of a posterior fossa dose of greater than 5000 cGy.\r"

  ".W": "Extended-field irradiation was administered after radical surgery to 76 patients with nodal metastases from cervical carcinoma Stages IB (37 patients), IIA (six patients), IIB (29 patients), and IIIB (four patients). The first recurrent sites of disease were distant organs via hematogenous routes of 12 patients and in the pelvic fields of eight patients. The 5-year disease-free survival rates were 95% for 27 patients with one positive node, 64% for 37 patients with multiple positive nodes, and 44% for 12 patients with unresectable nodes; 72% in total. Poor disease-free survival rates were associated with Stage IIB (60%), more than 30 mm invasion depths (44%), small cell cancer (0%), adenocarcinoma (57%), adenosquamous carcinoma (50%), and premenopause (60%). In 52 patients with nonkeratinizing large cell carcinoma, the disease-free survival rates were significantly different between Stage IB and IIB (87% versus 47%, P less than 0.05). This dissimilarity was caused by significant differences between Stage IB and IIB patients with less than 30 mm invasion depths (90% versus 53%, P less than 0.05), with parametrial extension (100% versus 39%, P less than 0.005), and with unresectable nodes (100% versus 0%, P less than 0.05). These results indicate that postoperative extended-field irradiation can control distant spread via lymphatic routes with significant improvement of patient survival, and that the number of positive nodes, tumor cell types, depth of tumor invasion, and clinical stages are important prognostic factors subsequent to this combined therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The role of phospholipase, lipoxygenase, and cyclooxygenase pathways in the mechanism of the cerebrovascular response to CO2 and H+ was investigated in newborn piglets. Responsiveness of pial arterioles, 48-206 micron diameter, to inhalation of 6% CO2 and to suffusion of acidic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, pH = 6.84), adenosine (10(-4) M), or theophylline (10(-2) M) was studied using a closed cranial window. Pial arteriolar diameter was measured using intravital microscopy. Phospholipase inhibitors quinacrine hydrochloride (10(-4) M in CSF) and p-bromophenacyl bromide (10(-4) M in CSF) abolished the CO2 vasodilation from delta diameter = 27 +/- 5% and 28 +/- 3% during baseline to 0 +/- 4% and -1 +/- 1% following the respective inhibitors. Following administration of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.), the CO2 response was converted from vasodilation, 31 +/- 6%, to constriction, -4 +/- 1% (p less than 0.001), while the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (2 mg/kg i.v. or 10(-4) M in CSF) augmented the pial arteriolar response to CO2 from 21 +/- 4% to 34 +/- 7% (p less than 0.005). Topical application of superoxide dismutase (40 units/ml CSF) plus catalase (40 units/ml CSF) also appeared to augment the CO2 response. Suffusion of the cortical surface with acidic CSF at constant PCO2 increased pial arteriolar diameter by 11 +/- 2% that was also abolished by indomethacin. Vasodilatory responses to topical adenosine and theophylline were not affected by indomethacin, suggesting specificity for H+ ion-related vasodilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Aortic impedance and pulse-wave velocity were calculated from measured pressure and flow signals collected during random ventricular pacing. Central aortic diameter was simultaneously determined with ultrasonic dimension crystals. Mean blood pressure was maintained constant to avoid the confounding effects of passive, pressure-induced changes in vascular properties. Nitroglycerin both reduced the amplitude of peripheral vascular reflections and delayed the return of these reflections to the aortic root. This reflection delay was manifested as a consistent leftward shift in both impedance modulus and phase. The magnitude of this reflection delay could not be entirely accounted for on the basis of the measured changes in average pulse-wave velocity along the aorta.\r"

Intravenous injection of protamine alone produced no hemodynamic effects and did not increase plasma levels of vasoconstrictor eicosanoids. Intravenous pretreatment with either a cyclooxygenase inhibitor or a hydrogen peroxide scavenger (dimethylthiourea) blocked both the increases of thromboxane levels and the pulmonary vasoconstriction.\r"

At 27 weeks of age with established hypertension and ventricular hypertrophy, ANPmRNA levels in ventricles from SHR and SHRSP were markedly increased, and total contents of ventricular ANPmRNA in SHR and SHRSP were approximately 50% and 250%, respectively, of the corresponding atrial contents. However, levels and total contents of atrial ANPmRNA in SHR and SHRSP were similar to those of WKY, and the total content of ventricular ANPmRNA in WKY was only 6% of the content of atrial ANPmRNA. ANP concentrations in ventricles of SHR and SHRSP were increased in association with the augmentation of ANPmRNA levels. During the prehypertensive stage at 6 weeks of age, slight increases in levels and total contents of ANPmRNA and ANP in the ventricle were observed only in SHRSP. These results demonstrate that the expression of the ANP gene is markedly augmented in ventricles of SHR and SHRSP, especially of SHRSP, at the stage of established hypertension and ventricular hypertrophy, and they also suggest that these genetically hypertensive rats are one of the best animal models to investigate the biosynthesis, storage, and secretion of ventricular ANP.\r"

The present study was designed to determine if the remaining peptidoleukotrienes, leukotrienes C4 and E4, share this property. In addition, influences of atropine and of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities on relaxation produced by leukotriene D4 and acetylcholine were determined to characterize further leukotriene D4-induced relaxation and to compare these properties with those of acetylcholine. Vasomotor tone was measured with isometric force transducers. Following induction of tone with norepinephrine, leukotriene C4 and acetylcholine produced concentration-dependent relaxation of renal and superior mesenteric arterial rings in which the endothelium was intact. Only minimal decreases in tone were produced in response to leukotriene E4. Neither acetylcholine nor leukotriene C4 altered tone after endothelium had been intentionally disrupted. Nitroglycerin relaxed rings both before and after rubbing the endothelium. These results demonstrate that, similar to leukotriene D4, leukotriene C4 possesses the capacity to produce endothelial-dependent relaxation in canine renal and superior mesenteric arteries. Relaxation of the superior mesenteric artery produced in response to acetylcholine, but not leukotriene D4, was inhibited in presence of atropine. Incubation of the rings with meclofenamate had no effect on relaxation induced by either acetylcholine or leukotriene D4. Thus, it appears that endothelial-dependent relaxation induced by leukotriene D4 is neither dependent on muscarinic receptor activation nor related to generation of cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid. In contrast, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid and nordihydroguaiaretic acid attenuated relaxation in response to leukotriene D4 and acetylcholine, suggesting that lipoxygenase-derived products may participate in leukotriene D4-induced as well as acetylcholine-induced relaxation.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the outcome of patients with persistent coronary artery occlusion despite treatment with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), the clinical course of 96 patients with persistent occlusion after 90 min of therapy was evaluated. All patients underwent cardiac catheterization 90 min after initiation of intravenous t-PA. Immediate coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was attempted when the infarct-related artery failed to reperfuse unless the vessel was technically unsuitable or the infarct was thought to be small. No baseline differences could be found between these 96 patients and 288 patients who achieved perfusion with the same protocol. Although patients with and without successful perfusion after t-PA had similar clinical courses before cardiac catheterization, those without perfusion had more complications (ventricular fibrillation, severe bradycardia, hypotension) during catheterization. PTCA achieved reperfusion with less than 50% residual stenosis in 73% of the 86 patients in whom it was attempted, while 16% were left with a high-grade (greater than 50%) residual stenosis and PTCA failed in 11%. Mortality was highest in the nine patients with complete PTCA failure (44%), compared with a 6% mortality in the 63 patients with an insignificant residual stenosis after PTCA and a 14% mortality in the 14 patients with reperfusion, but a greater than 50% residual stenosis after PTCA. In 10 patients with small infarcts (six), unsuitable anatomy (two), or \"spontaneous\" drug induced (but later) opening before contemplated PTCA (two), PTCA was not attempted and no mortality occurred. The in-hospital reocclusion rate after successful PTCA was 29%, despite the use of heparin and antiplatelet agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88194968\r", 
  ".W": "To examine the contribution of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites to the maintenance of cutaneous vasomotor tone after thermal injury, enzyme inhibitors were topically applied to the hamster cheek pouch before and after a spot burn. By use of video microscopy, blood flow was measured in adjacent arterioles that supplied the injured site. Ringer's solutions containing no drug (vehicle), indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor), BW755c (cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor), or ketoconazole (lipoxygenase/cytochrome P450 inhibitor) continuously suffused the entire tissue. There were no effects of these drugs on preburn blood flow at concentrations that blocked the vascular effects evoked by topical AA. In all groups, blood flow transiently increased after burn and thereafter decreased to levels that were altered by treatment. These results could not be attributed to alterations in vascular reactivity because neither the burn nor the drugs altered the vasodilation evoked by adenosine or prostacyclin. Relative to Ringer's, indomethacin had no effect, BW755c caused vasodilation, and ketoconazole caused vasoconstriction, which suggests that cytochrome P450 products might be vasoactive mediators in injured tissue. Therefore, purified synthetic compounds were compared with known vasodilators. The potency was prostacyclin greater than 12R-hydroxyeicostetraenoic acid greater than adenosine = 5,6 epoxyeicosatrienoic acid greater than AA, which supports the hypothesis that AA can be the source of a novel class of nonprostaglandin vasodilator compounds. In addition, at least one of the vasodilator responses was stereospecific. Nevertheless, the exact explanation for the differential effects of AA inhibitors on postburn blood flow is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of endogenous activation of sympathetic nervous system on systemic and regional hemodynamics and on plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were studied in subjects with essential hypertension. Stimulation of sympathetic nervous system was reflex-induced by a selective deactivation of carotid baroreceptors obtained by increasing external neck-tissue pressure (NTP) by means of a neck chamber. The effects of graded levels (+30, +45, and +60 mm Hg) and one single and sustained level (+45 mm Hg for 15 min) of NTP were studied. As expected, NTP caused reflex increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and forearm vascular resistance, whereas atrial pressures did not change significantly and cardiac output tended to increase. In the studies based on graded levels of NTP, immunoreactive ANF (irANF) progressively fell (from 31.7 +/- 10 to 13.3 +/- 4 fmol/ml; p less than .05) and the changes in irANF were significantly correlated with those observed in FVR (r = -.671, p less than .001). Both hemodynamic and irANF changes were prevented by adrenergic blockade (phentolamine + propranolol). During +45 mm Hg NTP for 15 min, the levels of irANF fell both in the pulmonary artery and in the inferior vena cava. The irANF arteriovenous difference also fell during this maneuver. These data show that, in hypertensive patients, factors other than atrial wall tension may influence ANF release. They also show that endogenous sympathetic activation may reduce ANF release.\r"

  ".W": "Severe falciparum malaria complicated by acute renal failure resulted in very high mortality. Ten patients with acute renal failure from falciparum malaria (infected rbc up to 80%) were continuously dialysed using Tenckhoff peritoneal catheter. Five were oliguric and BUN was maintained between 60 to 80 mg/dl (21.4 to 28.6 mmol/l) by hourly 1 to 1.5 liter dialysate exchange during the acute phase. The peritoneal urea clearance (mean +/- SD) was 12.1 +/- 1.2 ml/min with urea nitrogen removal of 13.4 +/- 2.3 g/day. In nonoliguric cases dialysis was also needed for additional removal of waste products since the remaining renal function could not cope with the hypercatabolic state. Peritoneal glucose absorption (135 to 565 g/day) gave considerable caloric supply without volume load and also contributed to the prevention of hypoglycemia. Varying degree of acute respiratory failure developed in all patients with 5 cases (2 oliguric and 3 nonoliguric) progressing to pulmonary edema. Swan-Ganz catheterization and hemodynamic study suggested the role of increased capillary permeability and volume overload from endogenous water formation in the development of pulmonary complication. Continuous removal of fluid and waste products minimized these problems and may prevent the progression of respiratory failure. One patient died of severe sepsis and the other nine survived. This study showed the beneficial contribution of continuous peritoneal dialysis in the management of acute renal failure from severe falciparum malaria.\r"

This study examines the relationship between charges and reimbursement in a university hospital ICU under a DRG system for the care of patients who consume a large amount of the ICU resources. For patients who were classified Class IV under the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System, with the possible exception of open heart patients, the charges for care delivered exceeded income received, with a net revenue of -$24,098 and an adjusted net revenue of -$5,057 for ICU Class IV patients (excluding open hearts). Thus, it appears that the care given to these patients may have resulted in a financial loss to the institution. If this were to continue, the financial impact might have a negative effect upon attempts to regionalize intensive care services.\r"

Mean airway pressure (Paw) fell significantly (p less than .01) within 12 h. The mean duration of conventional mechanical ventilation before starting HFOV was longer in 13 patients who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) than in 21 non-BPD patients (44.7 +/- 32.3 vs. 19.1 +/- 15.6 h, p less than .002), as was the duration of exposure to Paw greater than 15 cm H2O during that treatment mode (31.8 +/- 21.3 vs. 9.5 +/- 6.0 h, p less than .001). HFOV is often effective in the treatment of patients with PPHN, and early initiation of this type of mechanical ventilation may be associated with a reduced incidence of BPD.\r"

Mechanical failures, especially those that lead to rebreathing of exhaled gases, can be readily detected. The patient's progress during weaning and the consequences of changes in mechanical assistance can be virtually and noninvasively determined.

  ".W": "Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who have Mycobacterium avium-Mycobacterium intracellulare (MAI) infection typically have widely disseminated disease, often fail to respond to multi-drug chemotherapeutic regimens, and show little or no inflammatory tissue response. To determine if this clinicopathologic state correlates with in vitro lymphocyte responses to specific antigen, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 18 patients with AIDS who had MAI bacillemia were stimulated with either particulate (heat-killed bacille Calmette Guerin [BCG]) or soluble (M intracellulare) mycobacterial antigens. In comparison to reactive cells from healthy control subjects testing positive with purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD) or from MAI-colonized (non-AIDS) control subjects, cells from 16 (89 percent) patients with AIDS essentially failed to show any antigen-induced proliferative activity or secretion of gamma-interferon; however, in two patients, antigen-stimulated proliferation of gamma-interferon production was modest but within the range of responses of normal healthy control subjects. Thus, although an occasional patient with AIDS can develop disseminated MAI infection despite the presence of antigen-reactive cells in vitro, most MAI-infected patients with AIDS display a striking defect in responsiveness to both particulate and soluble mycobacterial antigens. Since treatment with gamma-interferon activates the mononuclear phagocyte in vivo, these results suggest a rationale for a trial of gamma-interferon therapy in patients with AIDS who have disseminated MAI infection.\r"

D. Searle SC 40827), and a general metalloproteinase inhibitor, 1,10-phenanthroline, on ovulation, as judged by the observation of follicular rupture, and on progesterone production of the perfused rat ovary. Ovaries of PMSG (20 IU)-primed rats were perfused for 21 h, and samples of medium were taken for analysis of progesterone concentration. The number of ovulations was estimated by counting the number of oocytes released into the perfusion chamber. Ovaries were stimulated with LH (0.1 micrograms/ml) plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; 0.2 mM), and this treatment resulted in a mean of 17.2 ovulations/treated ovary. 1,10-Phenanthroline dose-dependently inhibited ovulation, with 0, 0.2, and 12.5 ovulations/treated ovary at 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 mM, respectively. This inhibition of ovulation closely paralleled the inhibition of extracted collagenase from uterus and ovary. However, 1,10-phenanthroline also suppressed progesterone release in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of the collagenase inhibitor (CI-1; 25 microM) 1 h after LH plus IBMX inhibited ovulation (6.3 ovulations/treated ovary). Its relatively inactive stereoisomer (CI-2; 25 microM) did not suppress ovulation (20.0 ovulations/treated ovary). CI-1 inhibited extracted uterine collagenase 50% at a concentration of 2 microM, whereas CI-2 was only 1/15th as effective. There was an 80% loss of CI-1 from the medium during the perfusions. Neither CI-1 nor CI-2 had any effect on LH plus IBMX-stimulated progesterone release. These data demonstrate that the general metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline is able to inhibit ovulation, but also inhibits steroidogenesis. The more specific inhibitor of collagenase, CI-1, can inhibit ovulation without affecting steroid production. These data indicate an important role for collagenase in the ovulatory process.\r"

We have proposed that the timing of the episodic bursts of GH secretion is set by somatostatin (SRIF) withdrawal, while the magnitude of the bursts is set by the amount of GH-releasing factor (GRF) impinging on the somatotrophs, before and during SRIF withdrawal. We have now used an in vitro model of perifused rat pars distalis cells to further examine the interaction between GRF and SRIF on the magnitude of the burst of GH release that follows SRIF withdrawal. We first characterized the GH response, with time, to constant perifusion with GRF. The initial burst, followed by a rapid decrease in GH release induced by constant perifusion is due to a loss of GRF bioactivity in the perifusion medium and not to a decreasing responsiveness of the somatotrophs. This was followed by studies on the interaction between GRF and SRIF. The burst of GH release after cessation of perifusion with SRIF (10(-9) M) plus GRF (10(-10) M) can be blocked by the administration of SRIF during the burst. Also, the magnitude of the burst is proportional to the concentration of GRF preceding the withdrawal of SRIF. It is likely that similar relations apply in vivo, where SRIF withdrawal sets the timing and duration of the episodic burst of GH release, while GRF sets the magnitude.\r"

Homologous desensitization was characterized by diminished PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and was associated with a reduction in PTH-binding capacity, but not affinity. Heterologous desensitization was also seen, as manifested by decreased calcitonin (CT)-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity with normal CT receptor binding. The reduced capacity of the nonhormonal effectors NaF and guanylylimidodiphosphate to stimulate adenylate cyclase indicated a postreceptor defect at the level of the guanyl nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), whereas a normal forskolin response was consistent with a fully functional catalytic component. The G protein deficiency was confirmed by demonstrating that the addition of extracts of vitamin D-sufficient membranes to preparations of vitamin D-deficient membranes restored the normal responses to NaF and guanylylimidodiphosphate. In addition, cholera toxin- and pertussis toxin-catalyzed labeling of vitamin D-deficient renal membranes with [32P]NAD revealed a decrease in both the stimulatory and inhibitory binding proteins. Experiments with testicular membranes in vitro indicated that the adenylate cyclase abnormality was absent in tissue lacking PTH receptors. The results suggest that a major contribution to PTH resistance in vitamin D-deficient animals is a postreceptor defect at the level of the G proteins and that this defect is manifest only in tissue expressing the PTH receptor.\r"

In control females, the average rate of alpha-subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis (161 +/- 30 ppm) was greater than the rates for either LH beta (42 +/- 17 ppm) or FSH beta (57 +/- 21 ppm). In OVX animals the synthesis rate for all three mRNAs was increased (alpha-subunit = 413 +/- 55 ppm; LH beta = 432 +/- 121 ppm; FSH beta = 204 +/- 91 ppm), but the 5- to 10-fold increases noted for LH beta were the most dramatic. Chronic E2 administration (10 micrograms/100 g BW sc daily for 7 days) suppressed these elevated transcription rates to near control values. The E2 effect occurred rapidly, with a significant suppression of all subunit transcription rates at 4 h, and a maximally suppressive effect at 24 h, at which time alpha-subunit = 30%, LH beta = 12%, and FSH beta = 26% of the mRNA synthesis rate in OVX animals. Thus, the estrogen status in vivo can affect gonadotropin subunit gene expression at the transcriptional level. Subunit gene transcription rates are regulated coordinately in a negative fashion, but LH beta mRNA synthesis is affected most dramatically.\r"

  ".U": "88195952\r", 
  ".W": "Previous findings from this laboratory suggest a role for milk-borne PRL in the development of the inhibitory neuroendocrine controls over PRL secretion. Thus, rats that consumed milk deficient in PRL on days 2-5 postpartum show reduced concentrations and turnover of DA in the median eminence and elevated serum levels of PRL at 30-35 days of age. The present experiments were undertaken to investigate whether these consequences of neonatal PRL deficiency persist beyond puberty, and whether alterations in pituitary responsiveness to hypothalamic hormones may be involved. Lactating rats received sc injections of either saline or the dopamine (DA) agonist bromocriptine (125 micrograms/rat.day) on each of days 2-5 postpartum, a treatment that reduces the amount of PRL in milk without abolishing lactation. Blood samples were obtained from male and female offspring at various postnatal ages, and PRL concentrations were determined by RIA. Serum PRL concentrations in offspring from both groups were low until after weaning, but the female offspring of bromocriptine-treated mothers showed significantly elevated serum PRL between days 30 and 90 postpartum. Male offspring of bromocriptine-treated mothers also had transiently increased serum PRL levels, which returned to control levels by day 40. The turnover rate of DA in the median eminence, calculated from the rate of decline after synthesis inhibition, was reduced on day 35 in neonatally PRL-deficient offspring, as shown previously. However, no differences in DA turnover between the two groups were apparent on day 60, indicating a recovery of normal dopaminergic activity. Anterior pituitary cells of 100-day-old control and neonatally PRL-deficient animals were dispersed, cultured for 3 days, and then exposed to either TRH, to stimulate PRL release, or to the DA agonist bromocriptine, which inhibits PRL release. Pituitary cells of neonatally PRL-deficient offspring were almost completely unresponsive to bromocriptine with regard to suppression of PRL release and cytoplasmic PRL mRNA levels. In contrast, pituitary cells of neonatal PRL-deficient offspring were somewhat more responsive to TRH in stimulating PRL release and increasing the levels of PRL mRNA. These results suggest that a brief period of PRL deficiency during the neonatal period may result in long-lasting alterations in control of PRL secretion. The resultant hyperprolactinemia may be initiated by a reduction in the release of DA from the hyothalamus, perhaps reflecting a role for milk-derived PRL in the functional development of this neurosecretory system, and maintained in part by a reduction in pituitary responsiveness to DA.\r"

Although GnRH also appears to activate protein kinase-C in gonadotropes, the role of this enzyme in GnRH action remains undetermined. In the present work we have assessed the effect of pretreatment of pituitary cell cultures with a protein kinase-C-activating phorbol ester on gonadotrope responsiveness to GnRH. Pretreatment for 6 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) reduced the EC50 for GnRH-stimulated LH release approximately 8-fold without altering the maximum proportion of total cellular LH release. This increase in the potency of GnRH occurred in the absence of any measurable change in receptor affinity. Subsequent studies revealed that PMA pretreatment did not alter the EC50 for GnRH-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation (an indicator of phosphoinositide hydrolysis), but did cause a modest reduction (approximately 2-fold) in the EC50 for LH release in response to the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and the Ca2+ channel-activating compound maitotoxin. These observations demonstrate that the efficiency of coupling of the GnRH receptor to LH release can be regulated at a postreceptor locus by activation of protein kinase-C and that an increased responsiveness of Ca2+-regulated effector systems to mobilized Ca2+ appears to contribute to the observed effect.\r"

This study details side by side comparison of the alpha-subunits from insulin and IGF-I receptors in rat brain and liver. Insulin and IGF-I receptors are present in rat liver and brain, although IGF-I receptors are at a very low concentration in rat liver. These insulin and IGF-I receptors are clearly separate entities based on relative ligand affinities, antigenicity, and apparent molecular size. The alpha-subunits of the brain receptor for both insulin and IGF-I are about 10K lower in molecular size than the corresponding alpha-subunits from liver. These brain alpha-subunits are less sensitive to neuraminidase digestion than the corresponding liver alpha-subunit, although they do bind to wheat germ agglutinin. After treatment with endoglycosidase-F the deglycosylated apoproteins for both receptors from liver and brain have similar mol wt, suggesting that the observed differences were due to differences in N-linked glycosylation. The significance of differences in N-linked glycosylation between the brain receptors for insulin and IGF-I and the corresponding receptors in liver is not known.\r"

However, PTH and (Bu)2cAMP did not increase either [35S]sulfate incorporation into small proteoglycans or the incorporation of 3H radioactivity into hyaluronic acid and other glycosaminoglycans. PTH and (Bu)2cAMP also increased the incorporation of [3H] serine into both proteoglycans and total protein. In all cultures described above, the stimulation of [3H]serine incorporation into proteoglycans exceeded that of [3H]serine incorporation into total protein. These data indicate that PTH and (Bu)2cAMP selectively stimulate cartilage proteoglycan synthesis while they increase total protein synthesis. Since cAMP seems to play a mediatory role in the action of PTH, we elected to examine the effects of a limited exposure of chondrocytes to PTH or (Bu)2cAMP on the synthesis of proteoglycans. Treatment with PTH or (Bu)2cAMP for only the initial 2-7 h did not increase the rates of incorporation of [35S]sulfate, the 3H radioactivity with glucosamine, and [3H]serine into proteoglycans, as measured at 30 h, despite the fact that this treatment brought about a rapid and transient rise in the cAMP level. Furthermore, the application of prostaglandin I2 at concentrations that increased cAMP levels in a similar fashion as did PTH did not affect [35S] sulfate incorporation into proteoglycans. These observations suggest that in addition to the transient rise of cAMP, other biochemical changes are required for elaboration of the effect of PTH on proteoglycan synthesis. Although cAMP analogs mimic some of the effects of PTH in chondrocytes, the nucleotides and PTH appear to stimulate proteoglycan synthesis by different mechanisms.\r"

Histological staining of adjacent sections of sockeye salmon CS by periodic acid-Schiff reagent and immunocytochemistry revealed that the teleocalcin-immunoreactive cells were also periodic acid-Schiff positive. In bioassays using rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), the biological effects of teleocalcin were completely abolished by pretreatment with the antiserum before injection. The antiserum was ineffective by itself, however, in neutralizing endogenous teleocalcin. Immunoprecipitation studies of in vitro translation products from salmon CS poly(A)+ RNA identified a 26K protein, which corresponds to the size of the teleocalcin monomer as predicted by cDNA sequencing studies. Similar banding patterns were obtained with purified teleocalcin and crude CS extracts by Western blot analysis. However, there was one extra band (32K) in the CS extracts that was not present in the purified hormone preparations. This may represent the pro-form of the hormone in salmon.\r"

Antiserum specific for rat GRF did not affect the plasma GH increase induced by icv injection of alpha hANP. Intracerebroventricular injection of alpha ANP (3 nmol/rat) failed to stimulate GH secretion in conscious rats pretreated with cysteamine (30 mg/100 g BW, sc), a depletor of somatostatin (SRIF), and in conscious rats during constant iv infusion of SRIF (55 ng/ml). GH release induced by iv injection of synthetic rat GRF (200 ng/100 g BW) was exaggerated by alpha hANP (3 nmol/rat, icv) in conscious rats.

  ".W": "Using a monolayer approach, we have examined the acute (3 h) effects of GRF, somatostatin (SRIF), and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on GH release from pituitary cells of male and female 70-, 100-, and 130-day-old fetuses and newborn lambs and of prepubertal male lambs. GRF stimulated basal GH release in a dose-dependent (10(-12)-10(-8) M) manner at each stage in development. There was no linear relationship between maximal response and increasing age of the donor animals. The ED50 values for GRF were similar in all groups, except in the pituitaries from male and female 130-day-old fetuses, where the ED50 values were significantly higher. SRIF elicited a dose-related (10(-10)-10(-6) M) inhibition of basal GH secretion at each stage of fetal life and in the prepubertal period; although the response was lower in the youngest fetal pituitaries, there was no significant change in maximal response during the fetal or prepubertal period. No effect of SRIF on basal GH secretion was observed in newborn lambs. However, SRIF (10(-7) M) was able to block GRF (10(-8) M)-stimulated GH release in 100- and 130-day-old fetal and prepubertal as well as newborn lamb pituitary cells. Plasma IGF-I concentrations increased from 15.0 +/- 0.7 (mean +/- SE) and 13.8 +/- 0.9 ng/ml for male and female animals, respectively, at 70 days gestation to 55.8 +/- 3.2 and 51.8 +/- 11.1 ng/ml at the time of birth. The increase was much more pronounced in prepubertal lambs, especially in male animals, where IGF-I levels reached 300.8 +/- 37.7 ng/ml. IGF-I (100 ng/ml) had no effect on basal GH release in 70- and 100-day-old fetal, newborn, and prepubertal lamb pituitary cultures, but significantly inhibited basal GH secretion from 130-day-old fetal cells. This dose of IGF-I had no effect on GRF (10(-9) M)-stimulated GH release at 70 days gestation. It significantly inhibited this effect at 100 days and in prepubertal lamb cells. In 130-day-old fetal and newborn lamb pituitary cultures, IGF-I completely blocked the GH response to GRF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The cells (2.0 X 10(5)/ml) were cultured for 2 days and then exposed to TRH, phorbol-12 myristate-13 acetate (PMA), or calcium ionophore (A23187) with or without 100 nM T3 for two different preincubation periods, 3 h and 24 h. Cytosolic TSH and release of TSH into the medium were measured by a specific RIA for bovine TSH. TRH (10 nM, 100 nM), PMA (100 nM, 1 microM, 10 microM), and A23187 (100 nM, 1 microM, 10 microM) increased TSH release in a dose-dependent manner. One-hundred nanomolar TRH, 10 microM PMA, and 10 microM A23187 increased TSH release maximally from 176 +/- 6 microU/ml (mean +/- SD, n = 4) to 240 +/- 40, 308 +/- 39, and 228 +/- 16, respectively. PMA and A23187 interacted synergistically in the release of TSH. Cytosolic TSH was not affected by TRH or A23187. PMA (100 nM) together with A23187 resulted in a decrease in cytosolic TSH. PMA alone (1 and 10 microM) decreased cytosolic TSH content to 84% and 77%, respectively, of the control level, suggesting that PMA enhances release of TSH. One-hundred nanomolar T3 had no effect on the basal release of TSH when given for 3 h, but resulted in a 47% decrease when administered for 24 h. The inhibitory effect of T3 on TRH-induced TSH release was found when the cells were preincubated with T3 for 24 h, but not for 3 h. In contrast, PMA-induced TSH release was significantly inhibited to 74% of induced levels by preincubation with T3 even for 3 h, and further inhibition occurred with an increase in preincubation time. These data suggest that the effectiveness of T3 depends on the mode of stimulation, and that the more immediate reaction observed with PMA induction may result from the interaction of T3 with the protein kinase C pathway.\r"

In an attempt to generate a dopamine-responsive cell line, GH4C1 cells, which lack the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, were fused with cells from the pituitary glands of lactating rats to generate cell hybrids. The GH4C1 cells were fused with dispersed normal pituitary cells by either chemical fusion in 40% polyethylene glycol or electrofusion. The fused cells were grown in medium with hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT) for 4 weeks to select for hybrid cells. Control fusions between GH4C1 cells only or normal cells only did not produce viable colonies. Of 36 HAT-selected colonies, 3 responded to 10 nM bromocryptine (BCR) with inhibition of TRH-stimulated PRL release. These hybrid colonies had an inhibitory response similar to that of normal pituitary cells in culture. Both TRH- and vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated PRL release were inhibited to basal levels by 10 nM BCR, with an IC50 for BCR of approximately 0.25 nM. Basal hormone release was not inhibited by BCR. The BCR-sensitive hybrid cells grew more slowly than the parental GH4C1 line both in culture and when passaged in female Wistar-Furth rats. The response of the hybrid cells to the dopamine agonist and the characteristic of slow growth were lost after 9 months of continuous culture and after freezing cells. The parental GH4C1 cells were grown in female Wistar-Furth rats, the resulting tumors were dissociated, and the cells were grown in culture. This resulted in a brief establishment of the dopamine response. Stimulated PRL and GH release from freshly dispersed GH4C1 tumor cells was inhibited by BCR at concentrations from 0.1-10 nM, and spiroperidol reversed the inhibition. The inhibitory response to the dopaminergic agonist was lost quickly as the cells were carried in culture. These results demonstrate that GH4C1 cells may have the genetic information necessary for dopaminergic inhibition of PRL synthesis, but that the dopamine response is not observed under standard tissue culture conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The temporal relationship between LHRH release and gonadotropin secretion as well as the effects of castration on LHRH release were investigated in conscious, freely moving male rats. LHRH release was measured in hypothalamic/median eminence perfusates, while levels of pituitary gonadotropins (LH, FSH) were determined in sequential blood samples obtained via atrial catheters. Twenty-four to 26 h before experiments, rats underwent sham surgery or castration. LHRH release in push-pull perfusates from both groups was pulsatile, and nearly all identified LH pulses (83.3%) were temporally associated with LHRH pulses. Of the fewer irregular FSH pulses that were observed, only 43.7% were temporally associated with LHRH pulses. Mean LHRH pulse amplitude and mean LHRH levels were not different in intact and castrate animals. The frequency of LHRH pulses was moderately increased in castrate rats (1.30 pulses/h) compared to that in intact animals (0.83 pulses/h), and this acceleration was accompanied by a significant increase in LH pulse frequency, pulse amplitude, and mean level. It was also noted that the number of silent LHRH pulses (those not associated with LH pulses) was dramatically reduced in castrate animals. Characteristics of gonadotropin release (pulse frequency, pulse amplitude, and mean level) were not significantly different in animals undergoing push-pull perfusion/bleeding procedures from those in rats not receiving push-pull cannula implants. We conclude from these studies that 1) LH pulses show a high concordance with LHRH pulses, providing evidence that the LHRH pulse generator operates as the neural determinant of LH pulses in male rats, 2) FSH secretion is not associated with LHRH release in an obvious and consistent manner, suggesting that LHRH/FSH relationships are not easily discerned in these animals or that a FSH-releasing factor distinct from the LHRH decapeptide may regulate FSH secretion, 3) a modest increase in LHRH pulse frequency occurs 24-30 h after castration, and 4) silent LHRH pulses occur with much greater regularity in intact than in castrate rats. The latter two observations suggest that both hypothalamic and intrapituitary sequelae of castration may be critically important in the development of postcastration increases in LH secretion and the negative feedback of gonadal steroids.\r"

  ".W": "The failure of anti-steroid treatments to induce multiple ovulations in cattle in a repeatable way, prompted us to examine the role of the gonadal steroids in the control of gonadotropin secretion in this species. A better understanding of the control of gonadotropin secretion in the cow would assist in the development of treatments to control prolificacy. Groups of six heifers were implanted with one of three sizes of estradiol (E2) implant on day 9 of a synchronized estrous cycle, and five control heifers received empty implants. All heifers were ovariectomized during the luteal phase of the subsequent estrous cycle and given progesterone-releasing intravaginal devices (PRID). Blood samples were taken every 10 min for 12 h with PRIDs and for 6 h after PRID withdrawal, for the measurement of LH and FSH concentrations. The two larger implant sizes (increasing E2 concentrations to 7.4 and 18.7 pg/ml plasma during the luteal phase of the cycle) decreased ovulation rate, the number of large follicles, and luteal weight. After ovariectomy, the three implant sizes produced E2 concentrations comparable with those during the luteal and follicular phases of the estrous cycle and at estrus (1.5, 4.4, and 10.5 pg/ml, respectively). E2 alone decreased mean LH and FSH concentrations and LH pulse amplitude, whereas progesterone alone reduced mean gonadotropin concentrations and LH pulse frequency. Only in the presence of progesterone did E2 decrease LH pulse frequency. Steroid concentrations which mimicked those of the luteal and follicular phases of the cycle produced luteal- and follicular-phase patterns of LH and FSH secretion. These results confirm that E2 and progesterone are important regulators of gonadotropin secretion in cattle, and question the role of inhibin in this respect.\r"

  ".W": "Using a clonal strain of cultured Leydig tumor cells (designated MA-10), we have examined the effects of Ca+2 on the activation of cAMP accumulation and steroid biosynthesis by hCG. Our results show that addition of Ca+2 ionophores (A23187 or ionomycin) leads to inhibition of the activation of cAMP accumulation by hCG. The magnitude of this effect is dependent on the concentrations of ionophore and hCG used, becoming more pronounced as the concentration of hCG increases. A detailed examination of the effects of A23187 and removal of extracellular Ca+2 on the rates of cAMP synthesis and degradation in intact cells revealed that A23187 inhibits the rate of cAMP accumulation activated by hCG, but does not affect the rate of degradation of cAMP. On the other hand, removal of extracellular Ca+2 had no effect on the rate of cAMP accumulation activated by hCG or on the rate of degradation of cAMP. Removal of extracellular Ca+2, however, completely prevented the inhibitory effect of A23187 on the rate of cAMP accumulation. Additional experiments show that the effects of A23187 or removal of extracellular Ca+2 on hCG-activated steroidogenesis closely parallel those described for cAMP accumulation. We conclude that Ca+2 is an inhibitor of the hCG-activated adenylate cyclase in Leydig tumor cells, and that this inhibition imposes a limitation on the ability of hCG to activate steroid biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on the secretion of PRL and GH by a cell line derived from a rat pituitary tumor (GH3 cells) were examined. The interactions between bFGF and compounds that are known to modify the activity of GH3 cells (estradiol, cAMP, and phorbol esters) were also studied. bFGF has little effect on cell growth or on the secretion of GH by GH3 cells but specifically increases the capacity of the cells to release PRL. The effect is time and dose dependent and reaches maximal levels with a 24-h preincubation of the cells with bFGF. The effects of bFGF on PRL secretion are potentiated by the addition of estradiol (maximally effective dose 100 pg/ml approximately 10(-10) M) and are further increased by the addition of the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate. The results indicate that, like in normal lactotrophs, bFGF has a major influence on the release of PRL by tumor-derived GH3 cells. The results support the hypothesis that bFGF may play an important paracrine, if not autocrine, role in regulating the PRL-secreting cells of the pituitary. The potential use of GH3 cells to elucidate the mechanism through which bFGF modulates differentiated cell function is discussed.\r"

The in situ activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in neurites of these neurons was assayed by measuring the rate of accumulation of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the median eminence (ME) after the administration of a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor. The mass of TH was measured by an immunoblot assay using rat TH as the standard. Hyperprolactinemia was induced by pituitaries implanted beneath a renal capsule. Hyperprolactinemia resulted in a significant increase in the in situ activity of TH without an increase in TH mass. The release of dopamine from hypothalamic neurons was assessed by measuring the concentration of dopamine in hypophysial portal plasma. The mean concentration of dopamine in portal plasma of rats bearing pituitary implants was 3 times that in controls. When circulating PRL was neutralized by administration of antiserum against rat PRL, the activity of TH was reduced significantly compared to that in animals treated with preimmune serum. In animals bearing pituitary implants, phosphorylation of TH in the ME was not different from that in control animals. We conclude that the biosynthetic and secretory activities of dopaminergic neurons of the hypothalamus are potentiated by PRL, but the potentiation is not due to an increase in the mass of TH or to the capacity of the neurites of the ME to phosphorylate TH.\r"

  ".W": "The role of endogenous progestin synthesis in the modulation of FSH-induced aromatase activity was examined. Granulosa cells isolated from nonatretic medium-sized (3-5 mm) follicles of prepubertal pigs were cultured for an initial 48-h period, during which time aromatase activity was induced by FSH in the absence or presence of aminoglutethimide (AG). After induction, the cell monolayers were washed before being cultured for a further 6-h period in the presence of the substrate testosterone (0.5 microM). The aromatase activity was assessed by measuring the accumulation of estradiol during the test period. Basal aromatase activity was negligible and was unaffected by the presence of AG (0.1-100 microM) during the induction period. But when cells were cultured with FSH and AG (0.1-1000 microM) during the induction period, there was a dose-dependent, biphasic increase in the FSH-induced estradiol synthesis during the test period. Maximal enhancement was obtained with 10 microM AG (3.5-fold). Thereafter the aromatase activity declined and, at 1000 microM AG, was significantly (P less than 0.05) inhibited. At the same time, the FSH-stimulated progestin production during the induction period was inhibited in a dose-related fashion by AG. This AG-enhanced aromatase activity was dose and time dependent but was independent of the FSH concentration used. The apparent median effective dose of AG was 2.4 microM and a minimal time of 24 h or less was needed to potentiate the induction of aromatase activity by FSH. If AG was, however, added to the cell cultures during the test period, the FSH-induced aromatase activity was inhibited, showing that AG is an inhibitor of FSH-induced aromatase activity. This action of AG during the test period could be alleviated by the addition of testosterone during the induction period. The viability of the granulosa cells and the total cellular protein were not significantly (P greater than 0.05) altered by AG. These results show that the induction of aromatase activity by FSH could be enhanced by AG, which probably acts by inhibiting progestin production during the induction period, leading us to conclude that endogenous progestins might play an important role in modulating the induction of aromatase activity by FSH.\r"

Thyroidectomy was associated with the appearance of significant amounts of [125I]T4 binding to serum TBG in lean rats, but not in obese Zucker rats. Treatment of the TX rats in vivo with replacement doses of T4 prevented this increase in TBG binding, but enrichment of serum from TX rats with T4 did not. Significant amounts of tracer [125I]T4 binding to TBG was present in serum from 1- to 3-week-old normal rat pups, but not in 1-day- or 4-week-old pups. There were significantly higher levels of TBG binding of [125I]T4 in serum from 2-week-old rat pups raised in litters of 16 pups compared to those raised in litters of 4 pups. All manipulations that result in the appearance of TBG in rat serum also result in either weight loss or a slowing in the rate of growth, suggesting that the appearance of TBG in rat serum has a nutritional component. This possibility is further supported by the observations that increases in TBG binding of [125I]T4 are not found in obese Zucker rats fed a low protein-high carbohydrate diet for 14 days or fasted for 7 days, or after thyroidectomy, perhaps owing to the large stores of fuel in the obese rat.\r"

Twenty-five women received GnRHa either nasally or subcutaneously and 13 women received danazol 200 mg four times daily by mouth. During treatment amenorrhea and suppressed estradiol levels were observed in all patients. Each patient took a supplement of oral calcium 1 gm daily. DPA (reproducibility +/- 1.5%) was read by a single observer unaware of the treatment assignment of the patient. The mean (+/- standard error) of the entire group prior to treatment was 98.8% +/- 0.03% of a control population of women from the same geographic area matched for race, age, and weight. At the completion of treatment, BMD was slightly decreased in the GnRHa group and marginally increased in the danazol group but neither change was significant. Women with endometriosis have lumbar BMD in the normal range and ovarian suppression with either GnRHa or danazol produces no significant change in BMD.\r"

The authors tried to prove that the replacement of normal endogenous steroid levels could restore the functional coupling between opiatergic and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) neurons in patients with anorexia nervosa. Pulsatile LH-RH therapy has been used to achieve normal ovarian activity. The authors studied gonadotropin levels before and during intravenously (IV) pulsatile LH-RH therapy (50 to 100 ng/kg body weight/90 to 120 minutes) in three anorexia nervosa and two weight loss amenorrhea patients, during both placebo and naloxone administration (2 mg IV bolus plus 4 mg infusion lasting 120 minutes). Before therapy, naloxone administration did not significantly change gonadotropin levels in three out of five patients, while a decrease in gonadotropin levels was observed in the other two subjects. During LH-RH therapy, normal pituitary-gonadal activity was demonstrated and ovulatory cycles were found in all patients. Naloxone administration did not change gonadotropin release during LH-RH therapy. Data could support the hypothesis of either a primitive impairment of LH-RH neurons, or an alteration in central regulation of LH-RH pulsar in anorexia nervosa.\r"

The down-regulation of gonadotropin release was confirmed by the absence of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation at pump change every 2 weeks. Between week 3 and week 8 of treatment, a marked decrease in the urinary excretion of buserelin coincided with an increase in serum gonadotropins and estradiol (E2) in four patients. Following pump change, gonadotropins were stimulated and follicular cysts were observed at ultrasound examination. Serum progesterone (P) was in the luteal phase range in two cases. The suppression was re-established when the buserelin/creatinine ratio in the urine had re-increased. Otherwise, the pumping rate was doubled. Menopausal symptoms temporarily disappeared during the ovarian stimulation. A moderate uterine bleeding occurred when E2 suppression was reestablished. These observations show a rapid recovery of the pituitary-ovarian response to LH-RH agonist following a short period of a reduced infusion rate. In a slow release system, the constant delivery of an effective dose is required for the maintenance of suppression and for the avoidance of a possible hyperstimulation.\r"

The effect of TRH on gonadotropin secretion has not been well defined. This study investigated the effect of TRH administration on the peripheral levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) during the early follicular and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle in five ovulatory, euthyroid, and normoprolactinemic women. Two hundred micrograms of TRH were administered intravenously on days 3 to 5 and on days 21 to 23 of the same cycle. LH and FSH were measured prior to and every 30 minutes for 2 hours following TRH injection. Ovulation was confirmed in all cycles by midluteal progesterone. All women had normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and PRL responses to TRH stimulation in both cycle phases. Baseline and stimulated gonadotropin levels were analyzed by analysis of variance. Thirty minutes following TRH infusion, follicular and luteal levels of LH (mIU/ml, mean +/- standard error of the mean) significantly increased from 6.0 +/- 0.8 to 8.0 +/- 1.1 (P less than 0.005), and from 4.8 +/- 0.6 to 7.6 +/- 0.7 (P less than 0.005), respectively. Levels of FSH increased during both phases of the cycle, but the elevation was not statistically significant. These results suggest that TRH can stimulate gonadotrope secretion of LH, but not of FSH, in both the follicular and luteal phases of the cycle.\r"

Cortisol (10(-5), 10(-6), and 10(-7) M), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; 100 ng/ml), FSH plus cortisol (10(-6], or vehicle were added to replicate cultures. After incubating for 6 hours, medium was harvested and assayed for estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P). Cortisol (10(-5), 10(-6) but not 10(-7) M) significantly (P less than 0.05) stimulated E2 secretion when compared to controls. FSH alone did not alter E2 secretion while FSH plus cortisol had a similar effect to cortisol alone. Likewise, P secretion was significantly (P less than 0.05) increased by cortisol when compared with controls and the stimulation was dose dependent. FSH also stimulated P secretion, but the combination of FSH and cortisol did not give an additive or synergistic effect. It appears that cortisol can stimulate the secretion of E2 and P by human granulosa cells without involving FSH receptor interaction. The findings suggest that, in addition to pituitary and ovarian hormones, cortisol may also be directly involved in granulosa cell function.\r"

In the late follicular phase, 17-OHP levels correlated significantly with E2 and LH levels, and the number of follicles greater than 10 mm. Because rising 17-OHP levels preceded the LH surge in only a few patients, it has no clinical value as a marker for human chorionic gonadotropin administration for timed oocyte recovery. Plasma 17-OHP levels, however, may complement LH levels better than P levels in determining the most appropriate stage for surge-timed oocyte retrieval.\r"

However, in contrast to other modified lipoproteins taken up by both murine and human macrophages via the scavenger-receptor pathway that may induce the formation of foam cells, glycosylated LDL is not recognized by murine macrophages, and thus far, it has not been shown to lead to marked intracellular accumulation of cholesterol in human macrophages. This study illustrates that glycosylated LDL incubated with human monocyte-derived macrophages, at a concentration of 100 micrograms LDL/ml medium, stimulates significantly more cholesteryl ester (CE) synthesis than does control LDL (10.65 +/- 1.5 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.13 nmol.mg-1 cell protein.20 h-1; P less than .05). At LDL concentrations similar to those of plasma, the rate of CE synthesis in macrophages incubated with glycosylated LDL is more markedly enhanced than that observed in cells incubated with control LDL (3-fold increase). The marked stimulation of CE synthesis in human macrophages exposed to glycosylated LDL is paralleled by a significant increase in CE accumulation in these cells (P less than .001). The increase in CE synthesis and accumulation seem to be mediated by an increase in the degradation of glycosylated LDL by human macrophages. Glycosylated LDL enters the macrophages and is degraded by the classic LDL-receptor pathway in slightly smaller amounts than control LDL, but its degradation by pathways other than the classic LDL receptor or scavenger receptor is markedly enhanced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sorbitol accumulation, myo-inositol depletion, and reduced Na+-K+-ATPase activity have been identified in experimental diabetes in several tissues in which diabetic complications occur. However, a reduction in renal Na+-K+-ATPase activity has not been universally reported, prompting us to examine the influence of diabetes duration on the activity of this enzyme complex in isolated glomeruli. Additionally, we examined the ability of the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil to directly stimulate glomerular Na+-K+-ATPase activity in vitro, an area of interest in view of the central position that the ability of sorbinil to restore Na+-K+-ATPase activity in vivo occupies in the interpretive scheme that links associated changes in sorbitol, myo-inositol, and Na+-K+-ATPase to enhanced polyol-pathway activity. Glomerular Na+-K+-ATPase activity was significantly decreased in rats with acute (less than 18 days) streptozocin-induced diabetes but was significantly greater than control values in rats with more chronic (greater than 32 days) diabetes. In vitro addition of sorbinil (1 x 10(-7) M) directly stimulated Na+-K+-ATPase in control (0.627 +/- 0.090 vs. 0.843 +/- 0.098 mumol P1.mg-1.min-1) but not diabetic glomeruli. These results indicate that the time of examination after induction of diabetes critically influences glomerular Na+-K+-ATPase activity and suggest that sorbinil, at least in normal glomerular tissue, has a membrane-associated effect that may be independent of its aldose reductase-inhibiting property.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of malnutrition on gastric acidity and gastric bacterial colonization, we studied 35 severely malnourished Bangladeshi children before (0 wk) and after (3 wk) they received nutritional rehabilitation for 3 wk. These results were compared with those obtained from a similarly examined group of 20 better-nourished Bangladeshi children. Gastric acid output, both basal and after betazole stimulation, was significantly lower in the malnourished group at 0 wk compared with the better-nourished children (p less than 0.01): basal 0.22 vs. 0.52 mEq HCl/h and stimulated 0.90 vs. 2.5 mEq HCl/h. Both the concentration of acid and the rate at which gastric juice was secreted were decreased in the malnourished group but serum gastrin levels were not significantly different. After 3 wk, the malnourished children had improved from 61% (+/- 9.0%; SD) to 81% (+/- 8.1%) of expected weight-for-height and were not significantly different than the better-nourished group (86% +/- 11%). Nevertheless, gastric acid concentration remained depressed in the 3-wk group, although the rate of gastric juice secretion equaled levels observed in the better-nourished group. None of the better-nourished children had detectable gram-negative bacterial colonization of their gastric juice. In contrast, 26 of 32 (81%) malnourished children at 0 wk were colonized--even after betazole stimulation, 11 of 33 (33%) gastric juice samples yielded viable organisms--suggesting that the decrease in gastric acid output greatly reduced the gastric acid barrier. Interestingly, only 9 of 20 (45%) better-nourished children had gastric juice with basal pH values below 4.0, suggesting that the gastric acid barrier may be an intermittent defense factor in Bangladeshi children.\r"

  ".W": "In these studies we compared jejunal permeability to two probes--chromium 51-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA) (mol wt, 360) and ovalbumin (mol wt, 45,000)--under control conditions, during acute intestinal inflammation, and in response to systemic anaphylaxis. Acute inflammation was produced after infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and rats were studied at day 0 (control), day 4 (early), day 10 (acute), and day 35 (postinfection). At the latter stage, immune rats were also studied during anaphylaxis induced by i.v. N. brasiliensis antigen. In each study, blood and urine were sampled over 5 h after the probes were simultaneously injected into ligated loops in anesthetized rats. In controls, small quantities (less than 0.04% and 0.002% of the administered dose for 51Cr-EDTA and ovalbumin, respectively) appeared in the circulation and plateaued at 1 h. During acute inflammation, the appearance of both probes continued to increase with time. Compared with controls, 5-h values for 51Cr-EDTA and ovalbumin were (a) significantly elevated at day 4 (p less than 0.005), (b) increased approximately 20-fold at day 10 (p less than 0.005 and less than 0.01, respectively), and (c) normal at day 35. Urinary recovery of 51Cr-EDTA followed the same pattern. During anaphylaxis, appearance of the probes in the circulation increased at 1 h to values approximately 10-fold those in controls (p less than 0.001 and less than 0.01, for 51Cr-EDTA and ovalbumin, respectively), and then declined. Urinary recovery of 51Cr-EDTA over 5 h was also significantly increased. We conclude that epithelial barrier function becomes impaired during both acute inflammation and anaphylaxis. In this rat model, gut permeability changes to 51Cr-EDTA reflect gut permeability changes to macromolecular antigens. If similar conditions exist in humans, urinary recovery of 51Cr-EDTA may be useful in monitoring intestinal abnormalities associated with inflammation.\r"

J-chain expression was generally higher in IgA2 than in IgA1 immunocytes. The median proportion in normal mucosa was 100% for IgA2 vs. 88% for IgA1 (p less than 0.005); in ulcerative colitis, 69% vs. 46% (p less than 0.004); and in Crohn's colitis, 74% vs. 46% (p less than 0.004). Taken together with the overall IgA-subclass distribution, however, these results showed that the proportion of J-chain-positive IgA2 cells in the total IgA-cell population was lower for ulcerative colitis (20%) and Crohn's colitis (32%) than for normal mucosa (63%) (p less than 0.002). In relation to the total J-chain-positive IgA-cell population, which contributes to the secretory IgA system, an increased proportion (p less than 0.002) belonged to IgA1 in ulcerative colitis (61% vs. normal, 27%), whereas IgA2 was reduced (39% vs. normal, 73%). Similar but smaller trends were noted in Crohn's colitis. The disease-associated reduction of J chain might be compensated by the previously reported twofold numeric increase of IgA cells in colitis. Our study, therefore, did not suggest that the secretory IgA-cell system was quantitatively impaired in inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

Short term administration of opiate receptor antagonists during the luteal phase increases the release of both LH and PRL. However, the effects of prolonged opioid antagonism throughout the luteal phase are unknown and, hence, the precise role of endogenous opioid peptides in the reproductive cycle remains to be elucidated. In this study, we examine the ability of longer term opioid antagonism during the luteal phase to alter pulsatile LH and PRL release. Naltrexone (NTX), a long-acting oral opioid antagonist, at a dose of 50 mg, was administered daily for 7 days during the luteal phase in five women. Blood samples were obtained at intervals of 10 min starting at 0800 h for 11-12 h on matched days of the luteal phase of both a control and the experimental cycle. LH and PRL pulse frequencies were significantly increased at the end of the 7-day NTX administration period compared to those in the control cycle [LH, 0.22 +/- 0.04 (+/- SE) vs. 0.07 +/- 0.03 pulse/h (P less than 0.01); PRL, 0.20 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.02 pulse/h (P less than 0.05)]. The concordance between LH and PRL pulses increased from 50% in the control cycle to 70% in the NTX cycle, and there was a significant positive correlation between the amplitudes of the concomitant LH and PRL pulses (r = 0.72; P = 0.01). In conclusion, prolonged oral opioid antagonism increased pulsatile LH and PRL secretion during the luteal phase in normal women. The results underscore the important role of endogenous opioid peptides in controlling LH pulse frequency during the luteal phase of the cycle.\r"

Serum immunoreactive gonadotropin levels are modestly reduced, whereas serum bioactive LH levels are drastically suppressed. The effects on bioactive FSH levels, however, are not known. In this study, serum bioactive FSH was measured using an in vitro granulosa cell aromatase bioassay in four normal men given a LHRH agonist, [D-Trp6,Pro9-NEt]LHRH (LHRHA; 500 micrograms/day for 16 weeks), by sc infusion and testosterone enanthate (TE; 100 mg, im every 2 weeks) and in five men given 500 micrograms/day LHRHA by daily sc injection for 20 weeks and TE (100 mg every 2 weeks) from weeks 10 through 20. During the first study, serum immunoreactive FSH levels (IR-FSH) decreased by 56.5 +/- 4.8% (+/- SEM), and serum bioactive FSH (Bio-FSH) level decreased by 57.6 +/- 6.4%. The ratio of Bio-FSH to IR-FSH did not change. During the second study, both serum IR-FSH and Bio-FSH levels followed a triphasic pattern, decreasing slightly but not significantly immediately after initiation of LHRHA administration, progressively increasing to a peak (P less than 0.5 vs, baseline) at week 10, and then, after addition of TE to this regimen, decreasing slightly again. The Bio-FSH to IR-FSH ratio, as in the first study, did not change. When serum obtained at week 10 during the second study, just before initiation of TE, was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-100 column, IR-LH eluted in two distinct peaks, while IR-FSH eluted as a single peak. These results demonstrate that in normal men chronic LHRHA administration alone for up to 10 weeks or LHRHA plus TE for up to 16 weeks does not alter the qualitative characteristics of secreted FSH, since there was no dissociation between serum IR- and Bio-FSH levels.\r"

Weight loss produced significant increases in mean plasma total testosterone [240 +/- 116 (+/- SD, 8.5 +/- 4.0) to 377 +/- 113 ng/dL (13.0 +/- 4.0 nmol/L); P less than 0.01], free testosterone [9.5 +/- 5.0 (329 +/- 173) to 13.4 +/- 4.3 ng/dL (464 +/- 149 pmol/L); P less than 0.025], and FSH (6.5 +/- 4.7 to 10.9 +/- 8.5 IU/L; P less than 0.025). Plasma LH was lower than levels in normal men before and after weight loss and did not change significantly (10.3 +/- 4.8 and 10.8 +/- 6.8 IU/L, respectively). There was no change in plasma total E2 [54 +/- 26 (196 +/- 94) to 50 +/- 13 pg/mL (180 +/- 50 pmol/L)], free E2 [1.48 +/- 0.7 (5.37 +/- 2.54) to 1.33 +/- 0.42 pg/mL (4.83 +/- 1.45 pmol/L)], or total estrone [75 +/- 38 (280 +/- 140) to 82 +/- 24 (300 +/- 90) pmol/L], and sex hormone-binding globulin rose from 9.2 +/- 3.2 to 12.9 +/- 5.4 nmol/L (P less than 0.005). The increases in plasma free and total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin were proportional to the degree of weight loss. Thus, the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was largely reversed by the weight loss without any decrease in hyperestrogenemia, its presumed cause. We postulate a change in hypothalamic-pituitary function with weight loss, such that GnRH-gonadotropin secretion becomes less sensitive to suppression by a given amount of estrogen.\r"

To do so, we determined the LH secretory response to opiate receptor blockade by naloxone (0.08 mg/kg BW, iv) in 17 patients (age range, 9-23 yr). Eight patients were untreated (3 of whom had had spontaneous menarche), and 9 patients were taking ethinyl estradiol/medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment (5 of these patients were also studied before treatment). In addition, the plasma LH responses to GnRH (50 micrograms, iv) and placebo were determined in the patients as well as in 13 age-matched normal girls (6 prepubertal and 7 pubertal). Naloxone did not increase plasma LH levels in the amenorrheic untreated and treated patients with Turner's syndrome. However, in the 3 patients who had had spontaneous menarche and in normal pubertal girls naloxone increased plasma LH levels. GnRH was effective to the same extent in the patients and normal subjects. These results indicate that in patients with Turner's syndrome the opioidergic inhibition of LH secretion is impaired and is not restored by gonadal steroid replacement therapy. Moreover, the normal plasma LH responses to naloxone in the spontaneously menstruating patients with Turner's syndrome indicate both the clinical variability of this syndrome and the participation of endogenous opioid peptides in the regulation of normal menstrual function.\r"

Increasing the sialic acid content of TBG increases its anodal IEF mobility and decreases its rate of in vivo degradation, a mechanism for the elevation of serum TBG levels in pregnancy. In this study, the structure of oligosaccharides in TBG from subjects with various conditions associated with TBG excess was determined by measuring the proportion that bound to Concanavalin-A (Con-A). Since oligosaccharides with three or more branches (antennae) attached to the trimannosyl core are excluded from binding to Con-A, the percentage of serum TBG not bound to Con-A (% peak A) represented the portion of TBG molecules with three or more antennae in all oligosaccharide chains interacting with Con-A. Peak A contained the most anodal IEF bands, while the Con-A-bound TBG (peak B) contained the cathodal bands. Serum samples from 10 normal men and 10 premenopausal women did not significantly differ in terms of TBG levels, % peak A, or IEF mobility and were combined as a single group (normal). Eight subjects with elevated serum TBG levels due to inherited TBG excess [62.0 +/- 10.1 (+/- SD) mg/L] or 2 receiving 5-fluorouracil treatment (26.2 and 31.3 mg/L) compared to 20 normal (14.7 +/- 3.3 mg/L) had % peak A values and IEF mobility similar to those in normal subjects. On the other hand, high serum TBG levels in 8 women during the third trimester of pregnancy (39.2 +/- 5.3 mg/L), 2 women taking oral contraceptives (25.7 and 27.0 mg/L), and 3 women with acute hepatitis (34.8 +/- 4.8 mg/L) were associated with significant elevations of % peak A values (5.68 +/- 1.73%, 3.31% and 2.41%, and 3.25 +/- 0.78%, respectively) compared to those in normal subjects (1.33 +/- 0.40%), as well as increased anodal mobility on IEF. Treatment of a man for 3 days with ethinyl estradiol produced similar changes. Using data from densitometry measurements of IEF bands of TBG, the degree of anodal shift was quantitated (anodal index). This index correlated with the % peak A (r = 0.92) in all study subjects. We conclude that increased sites for sialylation, resulting from the increased proportions of triantennary oligosaccharide chains, account for the increased anodal mobility of TBG in hyperestrogenemia and hepatitis. Thus, in these two conditions, a reduced TBG degradation rate resulting from oligosaccharide modification is the likely mechanism of increased serum TBG levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Single sc doses of 0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 mg Nal-Glu GnRH decreased mean serum immunoactive LH (iLH) to 45.0 +/- 5.7% (+/- SE), 37.0 +/- 4.9%, and 31.3 +/- 4.2% of baseline, respectively. Maximal suppression occurred between 4 and 8 h after drug injection. Serum bioassayable LH concentrations significantly diminished 8 h after injection of 1.5 and 5.0 mg GnRH antagonist, but not after the 0.5-mg dose. Mean serum testosterone (T) fell to 39.8 +/- 5.0%, 32.1 +/- 4.9%, and 20.7 +/- 4.4% of baseline, respectively, after the 0.5-, 1.5-, and 5.0-mg doses. The decreases in serum iLH and testosterone (T) were more sustained after the higher doses; serum iLH and T were significantly suppressed 24 h after administration of the 5.0-mg dose. Twenty-four-hour integrated serum iLH and T concentrations decreased in a dose-dependent manner. However, basal and 24-h integrated serum FSH concentrations were not significantly affected by the drug. No adverse systemic side-effects occurred. Thus, the Nal-Glu GnRH antagonist effectively decreases serum LH and T concentrations in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and it, therefore, has potential as a male contraceptive.\r"

Immunoreactive ANF, measured by RIA, ranged from undetectable (less than 9.7) to 36 pmol/L. All measurable samples diluted in parallel in the RIA. Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and subsequent RIA confirmed the presence of ANF, with most of the immunoreactivity eluting at the position of standard human ANF-(99-126). Simultaneous plasma ANF levels were measured in most individuals and the plasma concentrations were less than those in CSF; most of the immunoreactivity in plasma also eluted at the position of human ANF-(99-126). Thus, ANF is present in CSF in substantial amounts in some subjects with neurological disorders. Further, the CSF levels exceeded the circulating plasma ANF levels in most subjects. These results suggest that ANF in CSF is at least partially derived from production in the brain and/or is concentrated in the CSF.\r"

Plasma melatonin levels also were measured in samples collected at the same interval from 7 patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea. A distinct daily rhythm in plasma melatonin was evident in all subjects, with peaks occurring around 0300 h. Each woman's rhythm was remarkably consistent throughout the menstrual cycle (in terms of the phase, amplitude, and total melatonin secreted). Plasma PRL levels also exhibited daily rhythms which did not change during the menstrual cycle; the nocturnal peak plasma PRL level tended to occur 1-2 h after that for melatonin. Among the amenorrheic women, both daytime and nighttime melatonin levels were significantly higher (P less than 0.005) than in the normal women. Their plasma PRL levels were similar to those in the normal women. We conclude that, as for PRL, the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion does not change significantly during the normal menstrual cycle. The elevated plasma melatonin levels in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea suggest that the hormone may be involved in the neuroendocrine pathology underlying this disorder.\r"

  ".U": "88198491\r", 
  ".W": "There have been conflicting reports on whether antithyroid drugs (ATD) act as immunosuppressive agents in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. While some have claimed that methimazole (MMI) affects the immune system directly, we and others have suggested that its apparent immunosuppressive activity is due to its ability to inhibit thyrocyte, rather than immunocyte, activity. To further address the question, we studied the action of ATD on interferon-gamma (IFN gamma)-induced HLA-DR expression on thyrocytes in tissue culture. We used a cytotoxicity assay, using chromium-51-labeled Graves' disease (GD) thyrocytes and normal thyrocytes incubated sequentially with a monoclonal antibody against HLA-DR and complement, with a cytotoxicity index as the measure of thyrocyte HLA-DR expression. MMI and propylthiouracil (PTU) were added along with 200 U/mL IFN gamma to thyrocytes cultured for 10-14 days. IFN gamma or supernatants from leukoagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated thyrocyte HLA-DR expression; however, the addition of MMI or PTU to either the PBMC or thyrocytes caused no inhibition of the IFN gamma or PBMC IFN gamma stimulation of thyrocyte HLA-DR expression, using either normal or GD thyrocytes. Potassium perchlorate and sodium iodide also had no effect on IFN gamma-induced thyrocyte HLA-DR expression. TSH (either bovine or human) did not induce HLA-DR expression on thyrocytes by itself, but did enhance IFN gamma-induced HLA-DR expression in normal, but not GD, thyrocytes; once again, the further addition of MMI or PTU did not inhibit the enhancing effect of TSH on thyrocyte HLA-DR expression. Low concentrations of TSH binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII; 100 micrograms/mL) did not alter the cytotoxicity index, but at 400 micrograms/mL or more it enhanced HLA-DR expression on normal, but not GD, thyrocytes in a manner similar to TSH; like TSH, it did not induce thyrocyte HLA-DR expression by itself. Moreover, addition of MMI to the combination of IFN gamma and TBII did not inhibit the response of thyrocytes in terms of HLA-DR expression. We conclude that ATD do not alter thyrocyte HLA-DR expression in vitro; however, the ATD may still cause immune effects in vivo secondary to their influence on thyroid hormone formation or synthesis or by inhibition of thyroid antigen presentation which indirectly may result in an immunomodulatory effect. While TSH and TBII similarly enhanced the IFN gamma-induced expression of HLA-DR on normal thyrocytes, they did not do so in GD thyrocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Multiple follicular development was stimulated in 5 women undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer for tubal infertility using three different treatments designed to vary the concentration of FSH and LH (14 cycles). The women received clomiphene citrate (150 mg/day) from days 2-6 alone or supplemented with either exogenous human menopausal gonadotropin (28 IU/3 h) or pure FSH (28 IU/3 h) from day 6 until the day of follicle aspiration. Inhibin concentrations increased 10-fold in parallel with those of estradiol, from 0.2-0.3 U/mL on day 2 (before the onset of treatment) to 4-5 U/mL on day 14 of the cycle (time of the peak LH level). Coincidental to the LH surge, the inhibin concentration declined 2- to 3-fold before increasing again early in the luteal phase. The concentration of inhibin was higher in the gonadotropin-treated group (clomiphene plus human menopausal gonadotropin/FSH) than in the group treated with only clomiphene during the follicular phase. The number of follicles stimulated was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in the group given exogenous gonadotropins [4.8 +/- 0.4 (SE)] than in the clomiphene alone group (2.2 +/- 0.4). These data strongly suggest that both the Graafian follicles and the corpus luteum secrete inhibin, which together with estradiol and progesterone may play a role in the regulation of FSH secretion during the luteal phase.\r"

Serum 11-OHA was undetectable (less than 1.5 nmol/L) in an adrenalectomized woman, a woman with 11-hydroxylase deficiency, and a woman receiving chronic dexamethasone therapy, confirming the specificity of the antiserum used in this study. Serum 11-OHA concentrations were similar in normal women [mean, 5.0 +/- 2.3 (+/- SD) nmol/L] and women with PCO (5.0 +/- 2.1 nmol/L); serum androstenedione concentrations were increased in women with PCO. Thus, the ratio of androstenedione to 11-OHA was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in women with PCO (2.0 +/- 0.7) than in normal women (1.1 +/- 0.5). Serum 11-OHA levels after adrenal suppression or stimulation were similar in women with PCO who had an ovulatory response and those who failed to ovulate after clomiphene administration. Administration of dexamethasone (1 mg) and injection of ACTH (250 micrograms) were associated with marked suppression and subsequent stimulation of serum 11-OHA levels in both normal women and women with PCO, and the responses were similar in the two groups. Also, the hour to hour and diurnal variations in serum 11-OHA were similar to those of androstenedione and cortisol during a 24-h period, indicating the adrenal origin of 11-OHA. Our finding of similar serum 11-OHA levels in the presence of increased serum androstenedione levels in women with PCO supports the concept that the ovary is the major source of excess androgen production in women with PCO.\r"

The sensitivity of these techniques was sufficient to detect a monoclonal population when there was as little as 1% clonal involvement in a mixed cell population. In the patients studied, DNA from non-T peripheral blood cells and non-T intrathyroid lymphocytes had only a germline gene pattern and no clonal nongermline rearrangements of immunoglobulin genes, as assessed using an immunoglobulin joining heavy chain (IgJH) gene probe. An analysis of the DNA from peripheral blood T cells or intrathyroidal lymphocytes revealed polyclonal gene rearrangement patterns and no clonal nongermline rearrangements of the T cell antigen receptor-beta and -gamma genes, as assessed using T constant-beta and T joining -gamma gene probes. These results indicate that the lymphocytes in peripheral blood and those infiltrating the thyroid gland in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease are of polyclonal origin.\r"

High dose (800-1200 mg/day) ketoconazole treatment decreased serum androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and testosterone (T) concentrations, while that of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone increased, suggesting a steroidogenic block at the level of 17,20-desmolase. The decreased serum T and increased sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations led to a significant decrease in the free androgen index. Serum estradiol, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations did not change. The serum LH concentration and the LH to FSH ratio increased during treatment, suggesting a negative feedback effect of T on pituitary LH secretion. The hormonal changes that occurred during high dose ketoconazole therapy persisted during subsequent low dose (400 mg/day) treatment. The therapeutic effect of ketoconazole on hirsutism manifested itself at 6 months. We conclude that ketoconazole reduces excessive androgen production in a dose-dependent manner and decreases the free androgen index in hirsute women; these changes are accompanied by significant alleviation of hirsutism.\r"

Simple correlation between serum carotene and carotene intake, as estimated by a three-day weighed method, was 0.19 (P = 0.08), which was substantially increased (r = 0.29, P = 0.01) after adjustments for a selected set of variables. Standardized coefficients of multivariate regression indicated that the most important predictors of serum carotene were serum cholesterol (beta = 0.38), total serum proteins (beta = -0.35), and sex (beta = 0.34), followed by carotene intake (beta = 0.28) and midarm circumference (beta = 0.20). These variables accounted for 46% of the variance. Results suggest that serum carotene may be related to protein-energy status in hospitalized elderly, but further investigation should be directed to serum carotene in undernourished elderly. Nevertheless, total serum proteins could be an important factor in any attempt to correlate carotene intake and blood concentration.\r"

This process is stimulated by catecholamine activation of adenylate cyclase through the beta-adrenergic receptor. However, beta-adrenergic responsiveness also diminishes with age. To investigate the age-related alterations in beta-adrenergic function in BAT, beta-adrenergic receptor number and cytochrome c oxidase activity were assessed in 3-, 12-, and 24-month-old rats, and adenylate cyclase activity was assessed in 3-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old rats. The amount of brown adipose tissue recovered from senescent rats was 30% less than that from either the 3- or 12-month-old rats. There was a corresponding decrease in the total amount of cytochrome c oxidase activity in the 24-month-old rats. In the senescent rats, the density of beta-adrenergic receptors was twofold less than in the 3- and 12-month-old rats. The decrease in density was predominately due to a decrease in the beta 1-adrenergic subtype. Isoproterenol- and NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were threefold greater and forskolin-stimulated activity was fourfold greater in the 3-month than in the older rats. There was no change in the Kact for isoproterenol with age. These biochemical alterations with age may contribute to the inability of older animals to thermoregulate when exposed to cold.\r"

  ".W": "There is considerable debate as to the appropriate role of helicopter transfer of sick patients. The debate over helicopter transfer of high-risk obstetric patients is even more intense. There is clear evidence that high-risk neonates are more likely to survive when they are delivered in a perinatal center compared with local delivery followed by transfer. On the other hand, there is concern that in-flight delivery entails \"extreme risks, both to mother and child.\" In spite of this debate, there has been little research into the frequency of delivery during transport to a hospital or into the mortality associated with such a delivery. A study involving a single center suggests that the incidence of in-flight delivery is very low. We contacted all American Society of Hospital-Based Emergency Air Medical Services (ASHBEAMS) member air ambulance programs to determine the national statistics for in-flight delivery and associated perinatal mortality. We found no instances of in-flight delivery in 357 helicopter transports; 315 of these women were in active labor at the time of transport and 72 were in the accelerated phase of labor. There is evidence that these flights were screened for safety. Airplane flights generally took more time than helicopter flights (P less than .05), and there was one in-flight delivery during 88 airplane transfers. Also presented are additional data that suggest in utero transport of high-risk fetuses to a perinatal center by helicopter is cost effective.\r"

  ".W": "A Ts cell subset has been identified in the spleens of responder mice 3 to 6 wk after immunization with an optimally immunogenic dose of L-glutamic acid60-L-alanine30-L-tyrosine10 (GAT). These Ts were positively selected by panning procedures by using a mAb (1248 A4.10) produced by immunization of rats with semipurified mouse GAT-specific, single polypeptide chain suppressor factor. These Ts cells inhibited the activity of virgin Th cells but not memory Th cells and this activity was genetically restricted by genes which are linked to the Ig H chain (Igh) locus on chromosome 12. Use of the Igh recombination strain, BAB.14, which has a crossover near the VHCH region junction, demonstrated that the genes regulating the Igh restriction map telomeric to the VH genes. The Igh-linked restriction regulated the interaction of A4.10+ Ts cells with virgin T cells and not B cells. However, A4.10+ Ts did not act directly on Lyt-2-Th cells, but required the presence of Lyt-2+ cells for suppression. Suppression by GAT-primed A4.10+-Ts cells also required syngenicity at Igh-linked genes by both Lyt-2- and Lyt-2+ T cells. These results indicated that A4.10+-Ts cells were inducer Ts cells which activated Lyt-2+ effector Ts cells which prevented primary GAT specific Th cell activity. The interaction between A4.10+-Ts inducer and effector Ts cells and/or the interaction of the effector Ts and its target cell were restricted by genes linked to the Igh constant region.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-linking of surface Ig has been shown to stimulate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in murine B cells, leading to increases in [Ca2+]i and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Preliminary evidence suggests that a similar activation mechanism occurs in human B cells. We wished to examine whether anti-Ig antibody-stimulated human B cell proliferation is as dependent upon the presence of PKC as is anti-Ig-mediated murine B cell proliferation. Using highly purified, small, dense peripheral-blood B lymphocytes from healthy adult donors, we confirmed that PMA, a direct activator of PKC, is a potent mitogen for human B cells that synergizes with anti-mu antibody. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PMA treatment abolishes detectable cellular stores of immunoreactive PKC. However, after such depletion of cellular PKC, anti-mu antibody is still capable of delivering a proliferative signal to human B cells. It is unlikely that this signal occurs solely on the basis of increases in [Ca2+]i, because the calcium ionophore A23187 does not induce a proliferative response in PMA-treated B cells similar in magnitude to that seen with anti-mu. Additionally, the finding that pretreatment of B cells with PMA ablates the ability of anti-Ig antibody to mobilize intracellular and extracellular calcium also suggests that the ability of PMA to enhance anti-Ig mediated stimulation does not depend on elevations of [Ca2+]i induced by anti-Ig. Together, these observations suggest that anti-Ig signaling of human B cells may occur via other pathways in addition to the phosphatidylinositol system of calcium influx and PKC activation.\r"

Cell cultures from men with a mean duration of 1.3 yr (range, 0.3 to 2.2 yr) of HIV-1 infection were treated with UV-inactivated, whole, purified HIV-1 Ag together with various concentrations of rIL-2. Cell supernatants were harvested after 5-day incubation and assayed for IFN activity against encephalomyocarditis virus in human WISH cells. IFN subtypes were characterized by neutralization of antiviral activity with antiserum specific for human IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha. Results showed that cultures from 68% (17 of 25) of the HIV-1-seropositive subjects produced \"immune\" IFN-gamma in response to whole HIV-1 Ag plus rIL-2. IFN-gamma was induced in only 20% (5 of 25) of cultures treated with HIV-1 Ag alone. Enhancement of HIV-1-specific IFN-gamma production by rIL-2 was synergistic rather than additive in that titers induced by the mixture were consistently higher than the sum of IFN titers induced by HIV-1 or rIL-2 alone. This effect was not demonstrable in cultures from 18 HIV-1-seronegative men. Similarly, HIV-1-immune specific augmentation of IFN-gamma production by rIL-2 was noted for PENV9, a recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41 and gp120 fragment. Production of IFN-gamma may be an important, HIV-1-immune specific parameter in the host response to this retrovirus.\r"

Heparin and fucoidan both completely inhibited passive EAE even when treatment was begun 3 days after transfer of cells. Pentosan sulfate was partially inhibitory whereas chondroitin-4-sulfate had no effect. Inhibition was not merely due to killing of the cells since active sensitization 14 days after cell transfer resulted in an early onset of disease indicating the persistence of transferred cells as memory cells. Although all the inhibitory polysaccharides are anticoagulants, it would appear that this function alone is not the reason for inhibition since a heparin preparation devoid of anticoagulant activity also partially inhibited EAE. Actively induced EAE was also significantly delayed by treatment with heparin. The results are discussed in terms of the polysaccharides inhibiting the enzymatic dependent movement of lymphocytes across central nervous system vascular endothelium.\r"

  ".U": "88198982\r", 
  ".W": "The basis for rheumatoid factor (RF) production in autoimmune or lymphoproliferative diseases cannot be understood without defining the molecular factors that dictate RF structure and specificity. Recently three different mAb (6B6.6, 17.109, and G6) have been developed that define cross-reactive idiotypes (CRI) on intact L or H chains of human monoclonal RF cryoglobulins. However, the true incidence of these CRI among RF and their relationship to each other have not been delineated. In the present experiments, a panel of 163 randomly selected IgM paraproteins was evaluated for the expression of the two kappa L chain CRI, 6B6.6 and 17.109, and the H chain CRI, G6. Among the paraproteins with kappa L chains, 14% expressed the 17.109 CRI, and 9% expressed the 6B6.6 CRI. Both ELISA and Western immunoblotting experiments showed that the two L chain CRI were mutually exclusive. Anti-IgG activity was documented in 22 of the IgM-kappa paraproteins, among which mAb 6B6.6 reacted with 7 (32%) and mAb 17.109 with 6 (27%). Both CRI were expressed exclusively by L chains within the kappaIII variable gene subgroup. Although 17.109 CRI+ paraproteins had kappaIIIb L chains, none of the 6B6.6 CRI+ paraproteins possessed L chains with this kappa sub-subgroup specific Ag. The G6 CRI was found predominantly among RF paraproteins and was frequently yet not exclusively associated with the 17.109 CRI+ L chains. Additional experiments were performed on a panel of normal adult human sera and documented the presence of 6B6.6 and 17.109 CRI on a small percentage (0.1 to 2.0%) of IgM from most individuals. These data indicate that 1) the mAb 6B6.6 and 17.109 identify two major and distinct CRI among IgM-RF paraproteins, 2) both CRI are associated exclusively with kappaIII L chains, 3) kappaIIIb and kappaIII non-b L chains are equally prevalent among IgM-RF, 4) the G6 H chain CRI is frequently associated with 17.109 CRI+ L chains, but not with 6B6.6 CRI+ L chains, and 5) although the ability to make 6B6.6 and 17.109 CRI+ kappa L chains is common in humans, these CRI are present in low concentrations in normal IgM.\r"

However, we have observed that IFN-gamma did not induce the expression of Ia Ag on Ia- human T cell lines. Neither did IFN-gamma enhance the expression of Ia Ag on Ia+ T cells. However, IFN-gamma was able to enhance the expression of class I histocompatibility Ag (HLA-A,B,C Ag) on a number of the T cell lines tested. Experiments with 125I-labeled IFN-gamma showed a relatively small degree of specific binding to these T cell lines. More extensive studies on two of the T cell lines demonstrated 1000 and 2600 IFN-gamma binding receptor sites/cell and binding affinities of 4.0 X 10(-10) M and 7.3 X 10(-10) M. Thus, although IFN-gamma can bind to human T cell lines and enhance class I histocompatibility Ag on these cells, IFN-gamma alone does not appear to regulate expression of class II histocompatibility Ag on T cell lines.\r"

A third type of Fc gamma R, the 72-kDa high affinity receptor known as Fc gamma RI, is also detectable on PMN that have been activated by IFN-gamma. Using mAb that discriminate among the three known types of Fc gamma R, we examined the effects of IFN-gamma and glucocorticoids on human PMN Fc gamma R expression. We also studied effects of IFN-gamma and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) on antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) of chicken erythrocytes and phagocytosis of IgG-coated ox RBC by human PMN. In 20 donors studied, we found that treatment of PMN with 400 U/ml IFN-gamma induced a 9- to 20-fold increase in the number of Fc gamma RI sites per cell, and DEX inhibited this induction of Fc gamma RI by 39 to 73%. Similarly, DEX significantly reduced the IFN-gamma stimulation of ADCC and phagocytosis. IFN-gamma had no effect on expression of Fc gamma RII or Fc gamma RIII. Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII expression was unaltered by 24 h of treatment with DEX alone, but Fc gamma RIII expression was sometimes increased by about 20% on PMN cultured with DEX. Nevertheless, we found a small but significant inhibition of ADCC and phagocytosis by 200 nM DEX. Our results indicate that Fc gamma RI plays a major but not exclusive role in the regulation of ADCC and phagocytosis by IFN-gamma and DEX.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a powerful mediator of inflammation. We have recently described a potential role for PAF in immune reactions, as it inhibits T cell proliferation and IL-2 production in response to mitogens. To further define the mechanism through which this inhibition is exerted, we used a coculture system in which PBML are preincubated with increasing concentrations of PAF for 24 h, followed by washing, treatment with mitomycin C and addition to fresh autologous PBML stimulated with PHA. In this context, a significant (40 to 60%) inhibition of proliferation was observed. In parallel, PAF-pre-treated cells induced a reduction (30 to 50%) of IL-2 production by PHA-stimulated lymphocytes. The PAF receptor antagonist BN52021 could partially block the PAF-induced suppressor cell activity, but also showed some suppressor cell-inducing properties of its own (20 to 30%). The expression of suppressor cell function during the co-culture could be partially abrogated by the inclusion of indomethacin, suggesting that cycloxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid were involved in this phase of suppression. When PBML were fractionated into monocytes, lymphocytes, or T cell subsets before pre-incubation with PAF, indomethacin-sensitive suppressor cell function was generated in the monocyte population. Monocyte-depleted lymphocytes showed slight helper effect, whereas CD8+ T cells were induced to become indomethacin-resistant suppressor cells. CD4+ T cells, in contrast, were activated to exert very marked helper effect. When incubated with PAF for 24 h, monocyte-depleted lymphocytes showed a 30% decrease in CD4+ T cell numbers and a 50% increase in CD8+ T cell numbers. Our data suggest a novel immunoregulatory role for PAF and potentially important interactions of this lipid mediator of inflammation with lymphocyte and monocyte functions.\r"

Mice exposed to cercariae attenuated with 20 krad gamma-radiation developed stronger and more persistent pulmonary leukocytic responses than animals exposed to equal numbers of normal parasites. Although vaccination with irradiated cercariae also stimulated T cell responses of greater magnitude and duration than normal infection, the lymphocytic infiltrate elicited by each regimen did not differ substantially in its composition, 5 wk after exposure. Studies with cercariae attenuated by different treatments established that a link exists between the recruitment of leukocytes to the lungs of vaccinated mice and resistance to reinfection. There was a strong association between pulmonary leukocytic responses and the elimination of challenge infections by vaccinated mice. Animals exposed to irradiated cercariae of S. mansoni were resistant to homologous challenge infection but were not protected against Schistosoma margrebowiei. Homologous challenge of vaccinated mice stimulated anamnestic leukocytic and T lymphocytic responses in the lungs, 2 wk postinfection, but exposure of immunized animals to the heterologous species failed to trigger an expansion in these populations of cells. Our studies indicate that pulmonary leukocytes and T lymphocytes are intimately involved in the mechanism of vaccine-induced resistance to S. mansoni. It remains unclear whether these populations of cells initiate protective inflammatory reactions against challenge parasites in the lungs, or accumulate in response to the activation of the protective mechanism by other means.\r"

  ".U": "88199008\r", 
  ".W": "The cell interactions that take place between Toxoplasma gondii trophozoites and the human immune system have been investigated by using an in vitro model of infection. PBMC were co-cultured with live, appropriately attenuated, trophozoites. When cells from immune (seropositive) donors were used, a proliferative response was observed. At the same time, the proliferating T cells proved capable of controlling the growth of live trophozoites. By contrast, cells from seronegative donors failed to mount a proliferative response and intracellular overgrowth of trophozoites with subsequent cell injury occurred. Actively proliferating T cells were expanded in continuous cell lines with IL-2 and periodical restimulation with Ag in the presence of autologous irradiated mononuclear cells. From some of the lines obtained, clones were also derived. Ten clones were selected for further studies. They proliferated in response to trophozoites but not to unrelated Ag. Their response required the presence of autologous monocytes-macrophages isolated from peripheral blood on Percoll density gradients. B cells that were obtained from the same donors and immortalized by EBV infection proved inefficient as APC. These data suggest that live trophozoites have to be processed by macrophages in order to be presented to T cells. Upon appropriate antigen stimulation, all of the clones produced IL-2 and IFN-gamma, a finding that was consistent with both their CD4+ surface phenotype and their helper capacity on B cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro. The supernatants of all of the stimulated clones released a factor that activated macrophages to kill intracellular trophozoites as well as an unrelated pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes. This factor was identified as IFN-gamma because it was neutralized by specific anti-IFN-gamma antibodies. The present in vitro model of response to live protozoa may prove suitable to assess the role of both T lymphocytes and macrophages in intracellular parasite infections in man. Furthermore, this experimental system may be applied to detect specific lesions of cell mediated immunity in a number of immunodeficiency syndromes.\r"

Administration of rIFN-gamma to mice or cattle at the time of primary immunization with VSV G glycoprotein enhanced the magnitude of a secondary virus-neutralizing antibody response after a booster administration of the same Ag without IFN-gamma treatment. Enhancement was statistically significant and occurred at relatively low doses of IFN-gamma in the absence of any additional adjuvants. Furthermore, cattle treated with IFN-gamma at the time of a single primary immunization were more resistant to VSV challenge than those immunized without IFN-gamma treatment. IFN-gamma treatment in conjunction with a single primary immunization may therefore provide a practical means of enhancing protection from a viral challenge without the use of inflammatory adjuvants or booster immunizations.\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports by a number of laboratories have shown that Ig-binding factors may play a role in the regulation of Ig production by B cells. Although numerous studies have addressed the specificity and biologic function of Ig-binding factors at the cellular level, little information is available regarding the mechanism whereby Ig-binding factor modulates Ig production by B cells at the molecular level. Herein we have examined the specificity and molecular mechanism of the suppression of IgA production mediated by IgA-binding factor. Using the IgA-secreting plasmacytoma, MOPC-315, as a target cell, we have demonstrated that: 1) IgA-binding factor binds to IgA, but not to IgG, IgM, or BSA; 2) IgA-binding factor can suppress proliferation as well as IgA production by MOPC-315; 3) soluble IgA, but not IgG or IgM can inhibit the action of IgA-binding factor; 4) suppression of Ig production by IgA-binding factor is maximal within 8 to 12 h after exposure to the factor and is reversible; 5) IgA-binding factor suppresses IgA production by selectively down-regulating synthesis of IgA H and L chain proteins; 6) IgA-binding factor selectively suppresses transcription of alpha-H chain and lambda-2-L chain genes; 7) IgA-binding factor suppresses accumulation of c-myc mRNA. These findings suggest that IgA-binding factor binds selectively to surface IgA on MOPC-315 and suppresses IgA production by down-regulating transcription of H and L chain genes. Suppression of MOPC-315 proliferation by IgA-binding factor may be related to the concomitant down-regulation of the expression of the c-myc gene. c-myc is deregulated in MOPC-315 by virtue of the reciprocal 15:12 chromosomal translocation present in MOPC-315 where the c-myc gene is translocated and rearranged into the alpha-H chain gene complex. Simultaneous suppression of the expression of c-myc and alpha-H chain genes suggests that these two genes may be coordinately modulated, in plasmacytomas, by IgA-binding factor.\r"

The REM cell line expresses serologically defined determinants, DR2 and DQw3, and the T lymphocyte-defined (Dw/LD) specificity, LD-5a. T cells can recognize differences between FJO (a DR2/DQw1 cell line that expresses the Dw specificity MN2) and REM for both DR and DQ molecules. cNDA clones encoding the polymorphic DR beta 1-, DR beta 2-, DQ beta-, and DQ alpha-chains were sequenced and compared with other DR and DQ gene sequences. The DR beta 1-sequence of REM is identical to the DR beta 1-sequence of FJO; the DR beta 2-sequence is also identical to that of FJO except for one amino acid difference at position 67 in the polymorphic first domain (Leu in REM, Phe in FJO) due to a single point mutation. The DQ beta-sequence is identical to that of DR4/DQw3 haplotype; the DQ alpha is different from the DQ alpha of DR4/DQw3 haplotype and identical to the DQ alpha of both the DR3/DQw2 haplotype of a Raji cell line and the DR5/DQw3 haplotype in deduced amino acid sequence. Taken together, these findings suggest that: 1) a single amino acid difference (position 67) in the third hypervariable region of the first domain of the DR beta 2-chain in the DR2 haplotype is apparently sufficient for stimulating T cell responses; 2) the DQw3 serologic specificity may be defined mainly by the DQ beta-rather than DQ alpha-chain; and 3) multiple genetic events have probably occurred to generate the rarely found REM (DR2/LD-5a/DQw3) haplotype.\r"

  ".U": "88199024\r", 
  ".W": "IFN-gamma has been shown to reduce the sensitivity of tumor cells to lysis by NK cells. The close relationship between NK cells and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells has prompted us to investigate whether IFN-gamma pre-treatment also affects the sensitivity of tumor cells to lysis by LAK. We have shown previously that IFN-gamma can induce a significant reduction in the sensitivity of both cultured and fresh (surgically obtained) human tumor cells to lysis by LAK. Herein we show that changes in the sensitivity to LAK lysis of cultured human tumor cells can be induced by as little as 1 to 10 U/ml of IFN-gamma; a dose well within the range that can be achieved in vivo. Protection is induced within hours after treatment with IFN-gamma and is dependent on the continued presence of IFN-gamma. Tumor cells cultured in IFN-gamma for several days remain less sensitive to lysis and do not become refractory to IFN-gamma-mediated protection. In the absence of IFN-gamma, treated tumor cells regain \"normal\" sensitivity to lysis within 48 to 72 h. We have also investigated the mechanisms by which IFN-gamma reduces tumor cell sensitivity to LAK lysis using cold target competition, monolayer depletion, direct binding, and kinetic assays. IFN-gamma pre-treatment does not alter the kinetics of tumor cell lysis by LAK. Our data are most compatible with a model in which IFN-gamma reduces the ability of a subpopulation of tumor cells to induce the LAK effector cell to initiate lysis. These results are closely parallel to observations made on the IFN-mediated protection of targets from NK lysis and support the notion that NK- and LAK-mediated lysis are closely related. These results may have significance in vivo because high levels of IFN-gamma may be present at the tumor site or may be induced after therapeutic immunomodulation.\r"

A short term assay was used to determine the capacity of murine thymocyte subpopulations to express the gene encoding the 55-kDa chain of the IL-2R after stimulation in vitro. Thymocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore for 20 h, stained with antibodies against the IL-2R or the MHC Ag, H-2K, and analyzed by FACS. At least 90% of CD4-CD8- thymocytes were competent to express IL-2R, implying that this functional response is acquired early in development. However, at least 80% of cortical thymocytes were unable to express IL-2R before or after stimulation. Additional fractionation of the nonresponsive cells indicated that they constitute the great majority of the CD4+CD8+ population, including virtually all of the CD4+CD8+ proliferating blasts. Most nonresponsive cells remain viable and react to the chemical stimuli by increasing their surface expression of H-2K. The inability of most cortical thymocytes to express IL-2R suggests that a discrete loss of function occurs in most cells as they differentiate from CD4-CD8- precursors into the CD4+CD8+ class. The inferred loss of function is mediated at the level of IL-2 RNA accumulation and may be correlated with a pleiotropic alteration in physiologic response pathways.\r"

The resulting production of IL-2 was taken as a measure of effective presentation. The results of 43 mAb-T clone combinations showed a potentiation of presentation of Ag at substimulatory concentration in the majority of the cases, indicating that each mAb is conducive to FcR-mediated uptake by macrophages, and that each T clone can be stimulated by properly presented Ag. In contrast, nine combinations yielded a lower response, two of them falling to baseline values. We attribute these results, which corroborate our previous evidence of directional help in the beta-galactosidase system, to a modulation in enzymatic processing of Ag and its subsequent presentation imposed by the paratope of the mAb binding to the relevant epitope.\r"

Lymph node cells respond well to the thymus independent 1 Ag, TNP-Brucella abortus. Because TNP-Ficoll is a soluble Ag and may not be retained well in the lymph nodes, we emulsified it with Freund's adjuvant and injected it into foot pads. This did not result in any antibody response in the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes though once again splenic B cells gave excellent responses. We find that the in vivo response to TNP-Ficoll can be induced in the lymph node if TNP-Ficoll is injected along with B. abortus in the foot pads of normal mice. This observation could not be repeated in the splenectomized mice implicating the role of the migration of APC or B cells from spleen to lymph nodes. Similar differential responses are obtained from lymph node and splenic B cells in the in vitro cultures. Lymph node cells respond to TNP-Ficoll with the addition of normal irradiated spleen cells but not with Sephadex G-10-passed spleen cells. This shows the absence of APC or lymphokines which stimulate B lymphocytes to respond to TNP-Ficoll in the lymph nodes. We found that IL-1 but not IL-2 or IL-4 was able to induce TNP-Ficoll response from the lymph node B cells.\r"

To obtain a population of Ia-bearing KC devoid of Langerhans cells, a method of depleting Langerhans cells from such suspensions was developed. Although Ia+ KC were unable to stimulate allogeneic T cells in a primary epidermal cell-lymphocyte reaction (less than 5% control), they did induce a proliferative response in an allospecific T cell line. Ia+ KC were unable to present native peptide molecules to class II restricted, Ag-specific T cell hybridomas. However, Ia+ KC were able to present a peptide fragment of pigeon cytochrome c to a hybridoma, suggesting that although these cells cannot process native protein Ag, they can present antigenic peptides. Ia+ (but not Ia-) KC also served as targets for class II restricted cytolytic T cell clones. These data indicate that the Ia expressed by KC is a functional molecule, and that Ia+ KC can participate in some immunologic reactions.\r"

In the setting of mild GVHD (receiving 10(4) or 10(5) T cells), by phenotypic analysis, lymphoid reconstitution occurs normally within 4 to 6 wk but there is a profound deficiency in the ability of splenic lymphocytes to respond to polyclonal activators such as LPS and Con A. This unresponsiveness is attributable to active suppression mediated by cells that express Thy-1 and can be removed with leucine methyl ester treatment. Thus, splenocytes from mice with GVHD suppress responses of normal T and B lymphocytes. Moreover, depletion of these suppressor cells restores normal function to splenocytes from mice with GVHD, and B cells isolated from these mice respond normally to T-dependent and -independent stimulation. Finally, IFN-gamma plays an important role in this suppression, because a neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma mAb significantly removes suppression of normal cells and restores functional responses of lymphocytes from mice with GVHD. These results provide insights into the mechanisms of immunodeficiency associated with GVHD, and suggest novel strategies for possible therapies for this disorder.\r"

Our previous studies have shown that IFN-alpha/beta, its inducers, and T cell lymphokines can induce lymphocyte migration into the skin after intradermal injection. The present studies were designed to determine the effect of rIFN-gamma, IL-1, and anti-IFN-gamma on lymphocyte recruitment into DTH. Small peritoneal exudate lymphocytes, which preferentially migrate to inflammatory sites, were labelled with 111In and injected i.v. into rats. The intradermal injection of IFN-gamma stimulated the migration of these lymphocytes into the skin. IL-1 induced very little migration by itself, but enhanced the effect of IFN-gamma. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that the migration of lymphocytes to IFN-gamma was rapid, with a peak at 6 h, whereas migration into a DTH reaction was minimal for the first 8 h and reached a peak 24 h after intradermal injection. Polyclonal rabbit anti-IFN-gamma anti-serum, and a Mab to IFN-gamma, DB-2, could almost completely block lymphocyte migration induced by IFN-gamma. Furthermore, DB-2 inhibited lymphocyte recruitment into DTH reactions by 50 to 90%. This Mab did not affect migration in response to IFN-alpha/beta, although it partially inhibited the response to polyI:C. The effect of IFN-gamma on lymphocyte recruitment was not specific for small peritoneal exudate lymphocytes, because both spleen T cells and lymph node cells migrated in response to IFN-gamma and DB-2 inhibited the recruitment of splenic T cells to DTH. Thus, IFN-gamma is a potent stimulator of lymphocyte migration into the skin and a major mediator of lymphocyte recruitment into DTH.\r"

Peritoneal macrophages harvested from a chronic MAC infection in C57 black mice are able to kill approximately 86% of intracellular MAC in contrast to 0 to 20% killing by unstimulated human and mouse macrophages in vitro. The availability of human rTNF-alpha, rIFN-gamma, and rIL-2 permitted evaluation of the role of each of these lymphokines/monokines, alone or in combination, in activating macrophages in vitro to kill MAC. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were cultured in vitro, stimulated with rIL-2, rIFN-gamma, or rTNF, and then infected with MAC (serovars 1 and 8). Mouse peritoneal macrophages were harvested, cultured in vitro, and stimulated with rIFN-gamma. rTNF (10(4) U/ml) was associated with a modest increase of intracellular killing of MAC (58 +/- 5%) even when utilized 24 or 48 h after macrophage infection or when administered for 5 consecutive days after infection (78.1 +/- 4%). Both human and murine IFN-gamma were associated with increased intracellular growth of MAC (32 +/- 4% for murine and 38 +/- 3% for human macrophages). However, intracellular killing (53 +/- 6% compared with control) was observed after 6 days of treatment with IFN-gamma. This latter effect was fully blocked by anti-TNF antibody, whereas rIL-2 alone did not augment the intracellular killing of MAC by human macrophages. rTNF plus either rIFN-gamma or rIL-2 triggered significant increases in superoxide anion production, but subsequent MAC killing was no greater than with rTNF alone. Treatment of macrophages with 10 U/ml of rTNF followed by rIL-2 (200 U/ml) was associated with 68% of intracellular killing. TNF seems to be an important monokine, promoting activation of mycobactericidal mechanisms in human macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that normal human alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes, as well as HL-60 and U937 monocyte cell lines, newly express IL-2R after stimulation with rIFN-gamma or LPS. In addition, macrophages transiently express IL-2R in vivo during immunologically mediated diseases such as pulmonary sarcoidosis and allograft rejection. We therefore investigated in vitro factors that modulate macrophage expression of IL-2R. IL-2R were induced on normal alveolar macrophages, blood monocytes, and HL-60 cells using rIFN-gamma (24 to 48 h at 240 U/ml), and cells were cultured for an additional 12 to 24 h with rIL-2 (100 U/ml), recombinant granulocyte-macrophage CSF (rGM-CSF, 1000 U/ml), rGM-CSF plus indomethacin (2 X 10(-6) M), PGE2 (0.1 to 10 ng/ml), 1 X 10(-6) M levels of caffeine, theophylline, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, or medium alone. IL-2R expression was quantitated by cell ELISA (HL-60 cells) or determined by immunoperoxidase staining (alveolar macrophages, blood monocytes, and HL-60 cells), using anti-Tac and other CD25 mAb. PGE production was assayed by RIA. We found greater than 95% of alveolar macrophages, monocytes, and HL-60 cells expressed IL-2R after rIFN-gamma treatment and remained IL-2R+ in the presence of IL-2R or medium alone. By comparison, greater than 95% of cells induced to express IL-2R became IL-2R- after addition of rGM-CSF, and the culture supernatants from GM-CSF-treated cells contained increased levels of PGE. This inhibition of macrophage IL-2R expression by rGM-CSF was blocked by indomethacin, and IL-2R+ macrophages became IL-2R- after addition of PGE2 alone. These findings indicate GM-CSF down-regulates IL-2R expression by human macrophages via induction of PGE synthesis. Moreover, a similar down-regulation of IL-2R expression was seen after stimulation with caffeine, theophylline, or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Hence, GM-CSF, PGE, and other pharmacologic agents that act to increase intracellular levels of cAMP may play a modulatory role, antagonistic to that of IFN-gamma on cellular expression of IL-2R by human inflammatory macrophages in vivo.\r"

At femtomolar concentrations, TGF-beta stimulates monocyte migration, and picomolar quantities induce synthesis of monocyte growth factors, including IL-1, that may promote tissue repair by regulating fibrosis and angiogenesis. Paradoxically, TGF-beta at picomolar concentrations also blocks the ability of IL-1 to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation. At 0.01 to 1.0 ng/ml, TGF-beta 1 and its homologue, TGF-beta 2, suppress the IL-1-dependent murine thymocyte proliferation assay. TGF-beta also inhibits human peripheral blood T lymphocyte mitogenesis. Inhibition of cell division appears to occur after activation of the lymphocytes inasmuch as neither gene expression nor translation of IL-2R is suppressed. Furthermore, TGF-beta does not block synthesis of IL-2. Therefore, TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 likely act at a site distal to IL-1 to block lymphocyte DNA synthesis. These findings suggest that TGF-beta secreted in an inflammatory site may be beneficial in diminishing lymphocyte function while promoting fibrosis and tissue repair.

  ".W": "Despite quantitative as well as qualitative differences, all three types of IFN (IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma) modulate the synthesis as well as the expression of class I and class II histocompatibility Ag and a melanoma-associated Ag located in the plasma membrane as well as the cytoplasm of human melanoma cells. By employing inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis it was demonstrated that IFN-alpha and -beta increase the expression of histocompatibility products and this tumor-associated Ag by a process not requiring new protein synthesis. In contrast, IFN-gamma does require de novo protein synthesis for its modulatory activity. Thus, it appears that IFN might trigger various adaptive functions in different cell lineages by inducing at least two separate sets of responses specific for either IFN-alpha and -beta or IFN-gamma. Because the induction requirements for (2'-5')-oligoadenylate synthetase as well as for the development of a cellular antiviral state by different IFN also display a similar protein synthesis dependence pattern, the present results suggest that a similar set of cellular mediators may be involved in the modulation of antigenic expression by IFN-gamma in human melanoma cells.\r"

  ".W": "HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic cell line, can be induced to differentiate along either monocytic or granulocytic pathways. The production of the second complement component, C2, is a marker of monocytic differentiation and can be up-regulated by cytokine stimulation. We studied the effects of IFN-gamma and vitamin D3, two factors previously shown to induce monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, on C2 production and C2 mRNA content. We found that HL-60 cells produce little if any C2 but can be induced to synthesize C2 by IFN-gamma. Vitamin D3 pretreatment followed by IFN-gamma stimulation resulted in earlier and greater production of C2. HL-60 cells did not contain detectable amounts of C2 mRNA unless they were stimulated with IFN-gamma. Pretreatment with vitamin D3 followed by IFN-gamma stimulation resulted in a 147% increase in C2 mRNA content compared with IFN-gamma stimulation alone. These results indicate that the up-regulation of C2 production by IFN-gamma and vitamin D3 is pretranslational although additional posttranslational effects were not excluded. C2 production by these cells is a useful marker of monocytic differentiation.\r"

All IgM RF bound best to sites on IgG and intact Fc. The monoclonal IgM RF did not bind at all to fragments lacking the C gamma 2 or C gamma 3 domains. In contrast, low level binding to the pFc' fragment, composed of the C gamma 3 domain, was seen with seven IgM RF, mainly from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). IgG1 binding appeared to be a requisite specificity of all human IgM RF. IgM RF binding to IgG3 subclass was common among the monoclonal IgM RF. Most RA polyclonal IgM RF but only 2 of the monoclonal IgM RF possessed the IgG1, 2 and 4 binding pattern. Monoclonal IgM RF which bound best to histidine-modified IgG also bound well to IgG3. The 7-kDa fragment D of staphylococcal protein A inhibited the IgG binding of most monoclonal and to a lesser degree polyclonal IgM RF. Thus, the results indicate that the C gamma 2-C gamma 3 interface region of IgG contains the predominant determinants for monoclonal and polyclonal IgM RF.

In human monoclonal B cell disorders, however, the co-existence of paraprotein Id and its auto-anti-Id has been described in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia and in association with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency. Because the majority of cryoglobulin IgM possess rheumatoid factor activity and thus bind the Fc region of IgG, we examined potential idiotypic interactions between cryoglobulin IgM and F(ab')2 fragments of autologous cryoglobulin IgG fractions. A rabbit antibody to the pepsin agglutinator site of human F(ab')2 was used as detection reagent. By recognizing epitopes exposed on F(ab')2 after the removal of Fc determinants by pepsin digestion, this reagent eliminates the detection of contaminating intact IgG. In a sensitive assay, we were unable to detect idiotypic interactions between the separated IgM and pepsin-digested IgG fractions of 10 mixed cryoglobulins. On the basis of these results, we suggest that in mixed cryoglobulinemia, the coexistence of paraprotein Id and its auto-anti-Id is unlikely.\r"

Inositol phosphate release provoked in intact B cells by any of the anti-receptor antibodies was not inhibited by pertussis toxin and only partially inhibited by cholera toxin.

  ".U": "88199071\r", 
  ".W": "The biochemical basis of Ca2+ mobilization after anti-Ig binding to B cell Ag-R has been further characterized by flow cytometric analysis of indo-1-loaded B cells. The ability to distinguish intracellular Ca2+ release from extracellular Ca2+ influx by using an extracellular calcium depletion-repletion approach has allowed us to study the relationship between the mobilization of Ca2+ from these sources. Studies involving manipulation of the Ca2+ gradient across the plasma membrane indicate that a significant portion of the Ca2+ mobilization response is preserved even when the normal inwardly directed Ca2+ gradient is reversed. In the presence of an extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]o) of 10 microM, the response to anti-Ig is not blocked by the organic Ca2+ channel blockers. This response is not reduced by further depletion of [Ca2+]o by EGTA Ca2+-binding buffers. Thus, the Ca2+ response that occurs when [Ca2+]o less than or equal to 10 microM represents intracellular calcium release. Analysis of B cells stimulated with anti-Ig in low Ca2+ medium ([Ca2+]o = less than 10 microM) followed by repletion of [Ca2+]o to 1 to 5 mM reveals that a significant increase in permeability of the plasma membrane to Ca2+ develops in the stimulated cells. The resultant Ca2+ influx is nimodipine (20 microM) sensitive. Both intracellular Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx are reduced in parallel as the concentration of anti-Ig stimulus is decreased, suggesting that Ca2+ influx may be coupled to the release of intracellular stores. Neomycin blocks anti-Ig-stimulated formation of inositol trisphosphate, which mediates release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. It also blocks the anti-Ig-induced release of intracellular Ca2+ stores as well as Ca2+ influx, indicating that both responses may be dependent upon phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis.\r"

SDS-PAGE analysis of purified anti-epi preparations showed only the presence of human IgG H and L chains. These antibodies preparations showed similar Western blotting profiles as the sera pools from which they originated. The main polypeptides recognized by anti-epi had apparent molecular masses 31, 46, 51, 75 and 85 kDa. No difference in these patterns were detected between anti-epi from pooled sera of cardiac (anti-epiC) and indeterminate (anti-epiI) clinical forms. Anti-epi preparations (20 to 60 micrograms/ml) of pooled and individual sera stimulated proliferation of homologous and autologous PBMN or T-lymphocyte-enriched population. The stimulatory ability was dependent upon the PBMN-anti-epi combinations. There is no direct correlation between the level of PBMN response to epi and anti-epi stimuli. Comparison of the stimulatory activities of anti-epiC vs anti-epiI on PBMN of either cardiac or indeterminate group of patients indicate that anti-epiC is significantly more active than anti-epiI (p less than 0.025). These data demonstrate the presence of auto-anti-idiotypic-T cells in chagasic patients and lead to the possibility that idiotype/anti-idiotype interactions may play a role in determining the pathogenesis of chagasic cardiopathy.\r"

In accordance with earlier findings obtained at the population level, some T cell clones were identified which lysed bone marrow macrophages of different MHC type provided the relevant Ag was present. This unusual target cell recognition was further analyzed using a T3+, L3T4-, Lyt-2+, F23+, KJ16+ T cell clone, designated L-28. Target cell lysis by this clone was Ag specific, apparently non-MHC restricted. In contrast, YAC cells and P815 cells were not lysed by clone L-28. However, lysis of irrelevant targets could be induced by anti-T3, F23, or KJ16 mAb. Furthermore, Ag-specific lysis was blocked by anti-Lyt-2 mAb and by F(ab)2 fragments of F23 mAb. In addition to its cytolytic activity, clone L-28 produced IFN-gamma after co-stimulation with accessory cells, Ag, and rIL-2 and conferred significant protection on recipient mice when given together with rIL-2. These data suggest that non-MHC-restricted Lyt-2+ killer cells generated during listeriosis are cytolytic T lymphocytes that interact with their target Ag via the T cell receptor/T3 complex and the Lyt-2 molecule and, furthermore, that these cells play a role in anti-listerial resistance. The possible relevance of IFN-gamma secretion and target cell lysis for antibacterial protection is discussed.\r"

We also observe isotype specificity in class switch recombination, with both allele rearranging to the same isotype in the three lines where an unexpressed chromosome is retained. Every 5' break occurred outside of and immediately 5' to the tandem repeats associated with Cmu, a result consistent with earlier studies on myelomas but in contrast to the pattern seen in lymphomas. Seven of the eight 3' switch sites, however, were within tandem repeats.

Our results show that IgH rearrangements occur in the thymus after T cell receptor gene and T cell specific gamma-gene rearrangements but before thymocyte maturation is completed. Therefore IgH gene rearrangements occur at an intermediate stage in thymocyte development. This may be of significance in delineating human lymphoid leukemias. Not all thymocyte hybridomas carried IgH gene rearrangements. Age-related shifts in frequencies of cells with IgH gene rearrangements, probably indicating changes in the composition of thymocyte populations, were found. Finally, a detailed analysis of D to J joins revealed an ordered progression of partial rearrangements at the IgH locus, whereby the most proximal DH-segment, DQ52, is used predominantly at early stages, but that other D to J rearrangements at the same locus may occur subsequently.\r"

  ".W": "Absorption of serum from chronically infected mice with homogenized schistosome eggs reduced antibody binding to the schistosomulum surface by 94%, indicating that almost all schistosomulum surface recognition during chronic infection is due to epitopes shared with the egg. Absorption of the serum with egg homogenate from which protein antigens had been removed by boiling and digestion with proteinase K resulted in a similar reduction of antisurface antibody demonstrating that all the shared epitopes that are recognized are carbohydrate in nature. Analysis of the time course of anticarbohydrate antibody production and the levels of antibody in mice infected with a single sex of schistosome indicated that eggs directly stimulated this response. Mouse mAb were identified that bound at very high levels to the schistosomulum surface and that recognized carbohydrate epitopes shared with the egg. Three of these had previously been demonstrated to passively transfer resistance, indicating that these surface carbohydrates are potential targets of protective immunity in the mouse. All the anticarbohydrate mAb also bound to the surface of schistosomula of other schistosome species. Thus, the strong immune response against these epitopes in chronic infection could account for the cross-specific immunity observed. Mice vaccinated with irradiated cercariae lacked high levels of anticarbohydrate antibodies and their recognition of the surface was largely due to antibody to species-specific polypeptide epitopes. With respect to the Mr greater than 200,000 and 38,000 antigens, it was demonstrated that these epitopes were present on the same antigens that bear the carbohydrate moieties recognized by antibodies from chronically infected mice. This specific polypeptide recognition is also reflected in the immunity generated by exposure to irradiated cercariae.\r"

  ".W": "To extend our previous observation in which the binding of resting allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) to recombinant gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma)-treated keratinocytes was characterized, we examined the influence of phorbol ester activation of the PBML to both autologous and allogeneic IFN-gamma-treated keratinocytes. The activation of PBML by phorbol esters (5 to 100 ng/ml) for brief periods of time (5 min to 1 h) at 37 degrees C led to an increase in the relative percentage of adherence to IFN-gamma-treated keratinocytes from 15% for non-activated PBML to 30% for phorbol ester-treated PBML. A biologically inert phorbol ester derivative did not enhance the binding reaction. No significant binding of phorbol ester-activated PBML was observed to non-IFN-gamma-treated keratinocytes. Both reduction in temperature to 4 degrees C and preincubation of the phorbol ester-treated PBML with anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibody, led to complete inhibition of this adherence reaction indicating a role for the LFA-1 molecule in phorbol ester-activated PBML/IFN-gamma-treated keratinocyte reactions. Immunophenotypic analysis of the adherent cell population of the phorbol ester-activated PBML to the IFN-gamma-treated keratinocytes revealed that the predominant adherent cell type was the CD8+ T-cell subset (44%) versus the CD4+ T-cell subset (33%) with 23% monocytes and no binding of B lymphocytes. These results suggest that phorbol ester-activated PBML binds twice greater than resting PBML to IFN-gamma-treated keratinocytes, and this increased adherence may further contribute to homing of activated lymphocytes to the epidermis and mononuclear cell trafficking in the skin of inflammatory dermatoses.\r"

The ability of serum from normal subjects and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with and without the LA, to modulate the release of prostacyclin (PGI2) and the expression of procoagulant activity by cultured human EC was investigated. Only the 10% and 20% serum concentrations from patients with SLE-LA produced a significantly greater inhibition of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) release (the stable metabolite of PGI2) than control serum. However, when patients with SLE-LA having Raynaud's phenomenon were excluded from this group, there was then no significant difference between the effect of the patient and control serum. Serum from patients with SLE +/- LA caused a significant increase in EC procoagulant activity compared to healthy controls. The two-stage partial thromboplastin time expressed in seconds decreased from 66 (normal) to 34 (SLE - LA) and 31 (SLE + LA), but there was no significant difference between the patients with and without the LA. The significantly increased EC procoagulant activity induced by serum from patients with SLE +/- LA may account for the observed increased incidence of thrombotic events in patients with SLE. Our data suggest that factors other than decreased prostacyclin release are responsible for the altered hemostasis observed in patients with SLE + LA.\r"

In patients three years of age or less, M. pneumoniae was isolated at the same rate from febrile and afebrile cases and from wheezy and non-wheezy cases. In older patients, however, M. pneumoniae was frequently isolated from febrile but non-wheezy cases. A peak in the number of the positive isolates was found in patients who were four years old. The peak number of M. pneumoniae infections at age four was confirmed serologically. This peak was in patients who were younger than those previously reported.\r"

The mean antibody titer in the P. cepacia-infected group was significantly higher than that in the other three groups; the mean titer in the P. aeruginosa-infected group was significantly higher than that in the noninfected and control groups. Preabsorption of CF sera with P. cepacia outer membrane produced a significantly lower mean antibody concentration than did matched samples preabsorbed with an equal amount of lipopolysaccharide. By western blot, significantly more P. cepacia-infected patients produced IgG to the 27- than the 36-kilodalton (kDa) porin protein of P. cepacia; 12 of 16 P. aeruginosa-infected patients produced IgG to the 27-kDa porin. Sera from all patients in both groups contained IgG to the porin protein of P. aeruginosa by western blot. We conclude that the 27-kDa porin of P. cepacia is antigenic in most P. cepacia-infected patients with CF and that some P. cepacia outer membrane components may be antigenically related to those of P. aeruginosa.\r"

Drugs (10-20 mg/kg) or placebo were administered intramuscularly to thermally injured guinea pigs at 3 h postburn and then daily for nine days postburn. All three drugs inhibited production of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 in wound fluid and concomitantly restored the bactericidal activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa to normal. Indomethacin also increased the proliferative response of splenic lymphocytes to concanavalin A; however, ibuprofen and piroxicam had no effect on this response. None of the drugs affected the extent of systemic complement consumption, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, or leukopenia in the injured animals. These results suggest that the PMNL bactericidal defect induced by thermal injury is preventable or reversible and that the mechanisms responsible for this defect are inhibitable by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\r"

After pretreatment with a nonactivating dose of rIFN-gamma (10 U/mL), ineffective concentrations of Pentostam (1 and 5 micrograms/mL) were converted to leishmanistatic concentrations, and a leishmanistatic dose (10 micrograms/mL) was converted to uptake of Pentostam. In a model of visceral leishmaniasis, infected mice were treated with ineffective concentrations of rIFN-gamma (10(4) U) plus suboptimal doses of Pentostam (10 or 50 mg/kg). With combination therapy, the doses of Pentostam required to achieve 50% inhibition or killing of visceral L. donovani were reduced by 10-fold and fourfold, respectively. These results suggest that IFN-gamma therapy may be a useful adjunct in visceral leishmaniasis and illustrate one potential role for IFN-gamma in the treatment of systemic intracellular infections.\r"

Culture supernatants from stimulated cells of seropositive individuals blocked the growth of T. gondii in human fibroblasts, whereas those from antibody-negative individuals failed to do so. The anti-toxoplasmic effect of culture supernatants correlated with the induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and the destruction of tryptophan, as previously described for fibroblasts treated with recombinant gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). The anti-toxoplasmic effect was blocked by monoclonal antibody to IFN-gamma. The protective effect correlated with the amount of IFN-gamma in the culture supernatant, as measured by inhibition of viral CPE. Thus, the level of IFN-gamma appears to be an important immune factor in protection against toxoplasmosis in humans.\r"

Pharyngeal culture was used to survey prevalence in staff and all other patients on the unit; three of 18 staff members and two of 19 asymptomatic patients were positive for B. catarrhalis. A case-control study showed that respiratory therapy, steroid use, and location within the unit were significant risk factors for B. catarrhalis infection or colonization. Strains from five patients and two staff members had identical bacterial restriction endonuclease digestion patterns with three different enzymes; these patterns were distinct from those of control strains. This study is the first to document an outbreak of B. catarrhalis infection confirmed with a typing system and thus establishes B. catarrhalis as a nosocomial pathogen.\r"

Rings of aorta, suspended in 10-ml organ chambers containing a physiologic salt solution, were precontracted with phenylephrine. Neutrophils (1 X 10(5) -4 X 10(7) cells/organ chamber) caused a cell number-dependent relaxation of the rat aorta that was augmented by superoxide dismutase (100 U/ml) or changing the oxygen content from 95 to 21%. The neutrophil-induced smooth muscle relaxation occurred in rings with and without endothelium and in rings precontracted with increasing concentrations of phenylephrine, prostaglandin F2 alpha or KCI. Catalase (1000 U/ml) and mannitol (1 X 10(-3) M) did not block the neutrophil-induced relaxation, whereas phenazine methosulfate (1 X 10(-5) M), hydroquinone (3 X 10(-5) M) and methylene blue (1 X 10(-5) M) reversed the neutrophil-induced relaxation. Pre-exposure of endothelium-rubbed rings to neutrophils (2 X 10(7) cells/organ chamber; 15 min) depressed the subsequent concentration-response curve to phenylephrine but augmented the relaxation induced by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast (1 X 10(-5) M). The effluent from a column restraining the neutrophils induced a relaxation of endothelium-rubbed aortic rings that was prevented by methylene blue (1 X 10(-5) M). These results demonstrate that rat neutrophils release a factor that has a pharmacologic profile similar to that previously reported for the relaxing factor released from the vascular endothelium.\r"

The major portion of the cellular Mg++ is not exchangeable. The 28Mg efflux rate was increased by 1.5 mM nonradioactive Mg++ after a time lag of 5 to 10 min; this increase was blocked reversibly by decreasing bathing solution temperature to 4 degrees C. A rapid and sustained increase in 28Mg efflux rate was elicited with added EDTA. Accumulation of 28Mg by rabbit aorta was increased more than 5-fold by substituting sucrose for NaCl in the bathing solution. Q10 values obtained for Mg++ accumulation in rabbit aorta incubated at different temperatures either in normal solution or low-Na+ solution ranged from 1.3 to 2.0. Uptake of 28Mg was inhibited substantially by 60 mM added K+, 1.5 or 15.0 mM La , 7 mM neomycin or 1 microgram/ml of antimycin A. These ions and drugs did not significantly increase 28Mg efflux when added during the slow component phase of the washout. Thus, the major portion of slowly accumulated Mg++ appears to be stored and exchanged intracellularly. The transmembrane movements of Mg++ depend upon simple diffusion, Mg++-Mg++ exchange and a transport process that is increased when Na+ is decreased. The EDTA-induced increase in 28Mg efflux rate may result from nonspecific membrane permeability increases, whereas ions and drugs decrease cellular Mg++ content by reducing uptake rather than increasing loss.\r"

In general, the order of potency for the three paradigms was: AMPH less than DA = TYR = PEA less than OCT. The Km values for uptake were positively correlated with the Ki values for inhibition of mazindol binding (r = 0.91; P less than .01) and with the potencies to induce DA efflux (r = 0.96; P less than .005). Potencies for inhibition of mazindol binding and for eliciting DA efflux also were highly correlated (r = 0.92; P less than .01). Correlations were lost if data for nomifensine (NOM), a NU inhibitor, were included in the analysis. Despite the significant correlations, AMPH, TYR, PEA and OCT Despite the significant correlations, AMPH, TYR, PEA, and OCT were 10 to 20 times more potent in inhibiting NU than in eliciting efflux or inhibiting mazindol binding. Conversely, the potency of NOM to inhibit mazindol binding was 10 and 800 times greater than that required to inhibit NU or to elicit DA release, respectively. NOM inhibited competitively AMPH-induced DA release. These results suggest that: 1) AMPH-like drugs bind to and are likely to be transported by the NU carrier, and 2) inward transport of these agents appears to have multiple effects (e.g., an increase in intracellular Na+ and Cl-) that act cooperatively to increase Vmax and reduce Km for the outward, carrier-mediated DA transport. AMPH, TYR, PEA and OCT had qualitatively similar effects on endogenous DA and [3H]DA release. Monoamine oxidase inhibition potentiated these effects. All these agents released more endogenous DA from control than from reserpine-treated slices. In control slices, TYR and OCT increased DA and DOPAC efflux; whereas AMPH and PEA increased DA and reduced DOPAC efflux, except at high concentrations in which DOPAC efflux also was increased. After reserpine, these agents reduced DOPAC efflux in proportion to the increased DA efflux. In summary, we propose that AMPH-like drugs increase DA efflux from a single cytoplasmic pool maintained by DA synthesis and spontaneous and drug-induced efflux of DA from storage vesicles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Flumazenil (2, 6 or 18 mg/kg) administered p.o. once a week according to a Latin Square design precipitated abstinence in both groups of dogs. Abstinence was evaluated using a Nordiazepam Precipitated Abstinence Scale (NPAS) of various signs of abstinence and by counting seizure episodes. Flumazenil caused dose-related increases in the NPAS scores of both diazepam- and nordiazepam-dependent dogs; the slopes of the two dose-response lines were not different. Both groups of dogs also had both clonic and tonic-clonic seizures after flumazenil administration. CGS-8216 (2, 6 or 18 mg/kg) administered p.o. did not cause a dose-related elevation in NPAS scores for either group of dogs but clonic and tonic-clonic seizures were seen. Thus, flumazenil precipitates the benzodiazepine abstinence syndrome, as evidenced by tremors, tachypnea and other signs, including seizures, whereas CGS-8216 may have some selectivity in precipitating seizures without other signs of abstinence.\r"

  ".W": "The properties of cholinergic receptors in homogenates of canine portal vein were determined with the radioligand [3H]quinuclinidyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB), and correlated with the functional responses of that vessel to carbamylcholine (CCh) in vitro. [3H]QNB bound to a single population of sites in the homogenates, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 125 pM (+/- 19), and a total receptor capacity of 24.4 fmol/mg of protein, which corresponded to 224 (+/- 67.3) fmol/g wet weight of the initial vascular wall sample. Competition of CCh with [3H]QNB in eight experiments revealed two binding sites of different affinity, present in about equal numbers with Kd = 0.48 microM and 31 microM (in the absence of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate), and Kd = 1.5 microM and 42 microM (in the presence of 100 microM 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate). Vascular strips in vitro contracted in response to CCh, with a threshold of approximately 0.3 microM, ED50 of 1.87 microM and maximum response of 344 g/cm2 (65% of the maximum response to l-norepinephrine). Strips precontracted by l-norepinephrine or by high potassium concentrations were slightly (4%) relaxed by 0.1 microM CCh, but further contracted by higher concentrations. The contractile responses were not altered by removal of the endothelium, and were blocked by atropine but not hexamethonium. The results demonstrate the existence in this vein of muscarinic cholinergic receptors that mediate smooth muscle contraction, and the receptor properties resemble those reported in cardiac muscle and brain.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether or not presynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors regulate the release of GABA, we examined properties of the presynaptic GABA receptor and compared the findings within the case of the postsynaptic GABA receptor, using the longitudinal muscle with myenteric plexus (L-M) preparation of guinea pig small intestine. Muscimol, but not baclofen, reduced the Ca++-dependent release of [3H]GABA evoked by high K+ in the presence of tetrodotoxin from L-M preparation of the small intestine preloaded with [3H]GABA. Bicuculline, picrotoxin and furosemide antagonized the effect of muscimol. Diazepam, clonazepam and pentobarbital potentiated the muscimol-induced inhibition of high K+-evoked release of [3H]GABA. The potentiating effect of clonazepam was antagonized by Ro 15-1788. Muscimol induced a Ca++-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive release of [3H]acetylcholine from L-M preparation preloaded with [3H]choline. The effect of muscimol was antagonized by bicuculline, picrotoxin and furosemide. Diazepam, clonazepam and pentobarbital potentiated the muscimol-evoked release of [3H]ACh. The potentiation of muscimol effect by clonazepam was inhibited by Ro 15-1788. These results indicate that both the GABA autoreceptor and postsynaptic receptor may possess the same property which is related to benzodiazepine and barbiturate binding sites in the enteric nervous system of the guinea pig small intestine. The benzodiazepine binding site seems to be of central type.\r"

We found that neutrophils, which had been activated by a phorbol ester or opsonized zymosan, oxidized dapsone to its nitroderivative. It appears as if this is due to oxidation of dapsone by myeloperoxidase to the hydroxylamine, followed by nonenzymatic oxidation of the hydroxylamine to the nitroderivative. The hydroxylamine can be isolated if ascorbic acid is added to the incubations. Monocytes also contain myeloperoxidase and activated mononuclear leukocytes also metabolize dapsone to the hydroxylamine. Dapsone also causes a mononucleosis-like syndrome. The reactive hydroxylamine could be responsible for both the pharmacologic and toxic properties of dapsone.\r"

  ".U": "88199907\r", 
  ".W": "Oral aspirin can be extensively hydrolyzed to salicylate in the stomach and liver before it enters the systemic circulation. \"Presystemic\" acetylation of platelets may thus occur during aspirin absorption. This may result in concomitant sparing of peripheral vascular cyclooxygenase mainly exposed to salicylate. We tested whether the \"biochemical selectivity\" of p.o. aspirin as an inhibitor of platelet rather than vascular cyclooxygenase was reduced by elimination of the \"first-pass\" hepatic metabolism. A portacaval shunt was inserted in anesthetized rats by connecting the portal vein to the inferior vena cava through a heparinized polyethylene \"Y\" cannula. Sham-operated rats acted as controls. Ninety minutes after recovery from anesthesia rats were given aspirin p.o. (10 mg/kg) and 45 min later serum thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha formation by vascular rings was evaluated by radioimmunoassay. Serum thromboxane B2 was almost suppressed completely in all animals; vascular 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha was reduced significantly (by 40-60% in aorta and vena cava) in rats with the portacaval shunt but not in sham-operated animals. The results in rats with the shunt were similar to those obtained previously after i.v. aspirin. Fifteen minutes after aspirin, plasma levels of unmetabolized drug measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography were significantly higher in rats with portacaval shunt (0.56 +/- 0.16 micrograms/ml; n = 5) than in sham-operated controls (0.16 +/- 0.02 micrograms/ml; n = 5). These findings support directly the role of first-pass hepatic metabolism in the \"biochemical selectivity\" of p.o. aspirin.\r"

Drugs were given directly into the cardiac sympathetic ganglia through the right subclavian artery (i.a.), unless otherwise stated. Positive chronotropic responses to angiotensin II (0.1 and 0.2 micrograms) were enhanced after repetitive high frequency preganglionic stimulation to the right stellate ganglion. After the stimulation, positive chronotropic responses to bethanechol (2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms), but not those to dimethylphenylpiperazinium (2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms), also were enhanced. The enhancement of response to angiotensin II was not affected by i.v. pretreatment with hexamethonium (40 mg/kg) plus atropine (1 mg/kg) or nifedipine (1 mg/kg). Responses to angiotensin II were not enhanced by A23187 (0.3 mg). The enhanced response to angiotensin II after the stimulation was reduced by the calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg) and by N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (0.5, 1 and 2 mg), but not by promethazine (1 mg) and N-(6-aminohexyl)-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (0.5, 1 and 2 mg). The enhanced response to bethanechol after the stimulation also was inhibited by N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide. Pretreatment with N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide before the stimulation prevented development of the enhancement in responses to the peptide. The inhibition of endogenous protein synthesis by cycloheximide, 2.5 or 5 mg/kg i.v. 6 hr before surgical procedures, strongly inhibited development of the enhancement in responses to angiotensin II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both in vitro and in vivo, L-659,066 exhibited specificity (comparable to rauwolscine) for alpha-2 over alpha-1 adrenoceptors. Studies comparing L-659,066 with a previously described antagonist, L-657,743, demonstrate that the new compound penetrates the blood-brain barrier only poorly after systemic administration. With a pA2 of 8.44 at alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the isolated rat vas deferens and an IC50 of 3.0 nM against the binding of [3H]rauwolscine to rat cerebrocortical membranes, L-659,066 possessed, respectively, about one-eighth and one-third of the potency of L-657,743. Similar relative potencies were obtained in vivo in pithed rats with regard to blocking peripherally located postjunctional and prejunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors (L-659,066 = one-seventh and one-fourth of L-657,743, respectively). In tests carried out in vivo with rats for ascertaining alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonism in the central nervous system--namely, accumulation of cortical dopa and antagonism of mydriasis induced by the alpha-2 agonist, clonidine--L-659,066 had, respectively, less than 1/345th and about 1/5000th of the potency of L-657,743. In mice, L-659,066 had, respectively, approximately 1/29th and 1/1400th of the potency of L-657,743 as an antagonist in vivo of the predominately peripherally mediated inhibition of colonic propulsion caused by clonidine as compared with the mainly centrally mediated antinocisponsive action elicited by the alpha-2 agonist UK 14,304. The foregoing findings are consistent with poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier by L-659,066.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Inasmuch as the presence of endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may affect benzodiazepine binding to tissue sections in autoradiographic studies, a protocol designed to check for this influence has been investigated. [3H]Flunitrazepam (1 nM) was used to label benzodiazepine receptors for autoradiographic localization. Bicuculline was added to the incubation medium of an additional set of tissue sections to antagonize any potential effect of endogenous GABA. Binding in these sections was compared to that occurring in another set in which excess GABA was added to \"create\" further GABA enhancement. Binding also was compared to adjacent sections which were treated similarly but also preincubated in distilled-deionized water to burst the cells by osmotic shock and eliminate endogenous GABA, thereby preventing any effect on benzodiazepine binding. The results indicated that endogenous GABA is indeed present in the slide-mounted tissue sections and is affecting benzodiazepine receptor binding differentially in various regions of the brain depending on the density of GABAergic innervation. Scatchard analysis of saturation data demonstrated that the alteration in benzodiazepine binding due to GABA was a result of a change in the affinity rather than number of receptors present. These experiments have been compared to the binding of the imidazodiazepine, [3H] Ro15-1788. We also show that the treatments affect endogenous GABA and not the receptors themselves. This suggests strongly that, when using a single nonsaturating concentration of radiolabeled benzodiazepine antagonist, autoradiographic studies to date may have been subject to erroneous interpretation due to the differential effects of endogenous GABA on benzodiazepine binding (increased affinity).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In seated, unanesthetized monkeys prepared with a head plethysmograph, ventilation during exposure to 5% CO2 mixed in air was measured after cumulative doses of each drug. In other monkeys, effects on behavior were studied by administering cumulative doses preceding sequential periods of fixed-ratio responding. Levorphanol, tifluadom, bremazocine and MR 2034 produced dose-related decreases in minute volume, tidal volume and respiratory frequency. In contrast, U-50,488 had only minimal effects on ventilation over the range of doses studied. All drugs decreased fixed-ratio rates in a dose-related manner. Comparisons between their effects in behavioral and respiratory experiments differentiated levorphanol and MR 2034 from U-50,488, bremazocine and tifluadom. Doses of levorphanol or MR 2034 that decreased minute volume markedly had little effect on behavior. In contrast, bremazocine, tifluadom and U-50,488 had less pronounced effects on minute volume at doses that suppressed behavior markedly. Naltrexone (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) antagonized decreases in minute volume produced by levorphanol, MR 2034, bremazocine and tifluadom, and apparent pA2 values were similar for each naltrexone-agonist pair. When the effects of levorphanol (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) were determined in the presence of U-50,488 (0.3 mg/kg), tifluadom (0.1 mg/kg) or bremazocine (0.003 mg/kg), the levorphanol dose-effect curve was shifted approximately 3-fold to the left, suggesting that the effects of the drugs were additive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MK-771 (0.01-5.0 micrograms i.t.) caused dose-related increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). TRH (10 micrograms i.t.), but not TRH-free acid, produced similar cardiovascular effects. The MAP response to MK-771 (i.t.) remained primarily intact after cervical spinal cord transection, whereas the HR response was attenuated (37% of control). The MAP response to MK-771 was blocked by peripheral administration of pentolinium or phentolamine, and was partially attenuated by adrenalectomy. The HR response was reduced by pentolinium or atropine. Assessment of changes in regional blood flow and vascular resistance with the radioactive microsphere technique showed that MK-771 increased total peripheral resistance and vasoconstricted cutaneous, skeletal muscle, adrenal, renal and intestinal vascular beds. Cardiac output and stroke volume were not altered. MK-771 had no effect on vascular resistance locally or in other central nervous system structures. However, blood flow was elevated by MK-771 in spinal cord and brain. These data show that TRH receptor activation in the thoracic spinal cord, presumably in the intermediolateral cell column, elevated MAP by increased sympathetic activity to the peripheral vasculature and the adrenals. However, the HR response to TRH receptor activation required a supra-spinal component and was mediated in part by vagal inhibition.\r"

All experiments were performed with endothelium-intact arterial rings, and tone was measured with isometric force displacement transducers. After tone had been induced with norepinephrine, LTD4 acetylcholine (ACh), nitroglycerin (GTN) and isoproterenol (ISOP), each produced concentration-dependent vasomotor relaxation. Because contractile responses produced by norepinephrine were enhanced in presence of methylene blue, the concentration of norepinephrine was reduced in order to induce tone that was equivalent to control. After this adjustment, incubation of the rings with methylene blue attenuated relaxation produced by LTD4, ACh and GTN, whereas ISOP-induced decreases in tone were unaltered. In addition, results of a separate series of experiments showed that cGMP levels in the arterial rings were enhanced at the time of peak relaxation produced in response to LTD4, ACh and GTN. In contrast to these observations, ISOP-induced relaxation was not associated with a change in cGMP concentration. When taken together, these results suggest that cGMP serves as a participant in endothelium-dependent relaxation produced by both LTD4 and ACh, as well as endothelium-independent relaxation produced by GTN.\r"

Acetylcholine (ACh, 1.0-10.0 nmol), an M1 and M2 receptor agonist, and arecaidine propargyl ester (APE, 1.0-5.0 nmol), a selective M2 agonist, produced a dose-related increase in the output of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and a decrease in heart rate, whereas 4-[m-chlorophenyl carbamoyl]-2-butynyl-trimethylammonium chloride (McN-A-343, 10 nmol-1.0 mumol), a selective M1 receptor agonist, did not alter PG output.

  ".W": "We studied 14 postpubertal patients at an average of 33 months after treatment for testicular torsion. Of these patients 11 had been treated by detorsion and 3 by orchiectomy. Five normal male volunteers of the approximate age of the study group served as controls. The patients treated by detorsion were subdivided into 3 groups based on the degree of atrophy of the detorsed testicle: group 1--no testicular atrophy (5), group 2--25 per cent testicular atrophy (2) and group 3--greater than 90 per cent testicular atrophy (4). Mean duration of torsion was greatest in the orchiectomy group (161 hours) compared to 6, 16 and 29 hours for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone response to an intravenous bolus of 100 mcg. synthetic gonadotropin releasing hormone was measured in all patients. All groups had a greater mean follicle-stimulating hormone response to gonadotropin releasing hormone stimulation than controls (p less than 0.05). Patients who underwent orchiectomy had the greatest follicle-stimulating hormone response to gonadotropin releasing hormone stimulation. Mean luteinizing hormone response to gonadotropin releasing hormone stimulation was normal in patients without atrophy (group 1) but it was greater than controls in patients who had atrophy (groups 2 and 3) or who underwent orchiectomy (p less than 0.05). Several conclusions could be made from our study. All patient groups treated for torsion had evidence of testicular dysfunction. Patients who underwent orchiectomy displayed more testicular dysfunction than patients who had atrophy after detorsion. Testicular dysfunction after torsion is more likely to involve spermatogenic before Leydig cell function.\r"

We followed the course and outcome of 72 patients with clinical stages B and C prostate cancer who were treated with surgical staging, insertion of gold grains and external radiation at our institutions between 1975 and 1984. Of the patients 44 (61 per cent) had clinical stage B disease and the majority (89 per cent) of these were stage B2 lesions. The remaining 28 patients (39 per cent) had clinical stage C tumors. In our series 27 per cent of the clinical stage B and 68 per cent of the clinical stage C cancer patients had positive lymph nodes. The 5-year survival free of disease was 52 per cent for patients with both stages of disease. The 7-year survival free of disease was 47 per cent for patients with clinical stage B and 14 per cent for those with clinical stage C cancer. Lymph node status did not have a statistically significant effect on total survival but survival free of disease correlated significantly with node status. Local treatment failures were defined as patients who required transurethral prostatic resection or orchiectomy for palliation of obstructive symptoms related to local tumor regrowth. By these criteria we prevented local progression in 78 per cent of the patients at 5 years.\r"

  ".W": "Elemental balances, and skeletal muscle membrane potential (Em) and biopsy were utilized to evaluate electrolyte homeostasis and body composition in 11 healthy adult volunteers after 10 days of starvation. This controlled, acute malnutrition was followed by refeeding for 10 days with two different, commonly used, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. Six subjects were refed with crystalline amino acids and dextrose (dextrose group), while five subjects received amino acids, dextrose, and lipid (lipid group). During starvation, negative balances for potassium, phosphorous, magnesium, and nitrogen were observed in both groups. When compared to starvation, total parenteral nutrition produced statistically significant (p less than 0.05) equilibrium or positive electrolyte and nitrogen balances for both, the dextrose and lipid groups. During TPN, there was a significantly (p less than 0.001) positive chloride balance in the lipid group when compared to the dextrose group. At the conclusion of the 10-day period of TPN, there was a decrease (p less than 0.05) in skeletal muscle Em. This change, in concert with the electrolyte balance data obtained during parenteral repletion, lead us to postulate that restoration of lean tissue protein and cellular function does not occur at a rate which might be inferred from the positive nitrogen balance observed in this model. A persistent defect in cellular function which was evident after starvation, suggests that a brief period of TPN is insufficient to restore skeletal muscle integrity.\r"

Nonessential fatty acids were studied, as these components of lipid therapy have received little attention. Results indicate that soybean oil emulsions are effective in reversing fatty acid profiles found in EFAD, and both essential and nonessential fatty acids are under strict metabolic control.\r"

Patients were randomized into two groups: one group received a double-lumen catheter via a guidewire change of the preexisting single-lumen subclavian catheter. In the second group, a second single-lumen subclavian catheter was inserted and the preexisting single-lumen catheter was changed over a guidewire. Patients were followed by the Nutrition Support Service and were managed identically with regard to solutions given, catheter care, dressing changes, monitoring of mechanical complications, and evaluation of fever. Total infection rates in both groups were identical (22.7%). The difference in mechanical complication rates in the double-lumen catheter group (9%) and the group with bilateral single-lumen catheters (22.7%) was not significant by Fischer's exact test. The multiple-lumen catheter is superior in convenience and as safe as bilateral single-lumen catheters.\r"

Tube positions were verified radiographically within 4 hr after insertions. Radiographs were repeated daily for 3 days or until duodenal intubation occurred. Successful duodenal intubations were achieved in 35 patients (57%) with weighted feeding tubes and in 37 patients (67%) with unweighted feeding tubes. This difference was not significant. Weighted nasoenteric feeding tubes offer no advantage over unweighted tubes in achieving duodenal intubations.\r"

  ".W": "Metabolic Acidosis is a reported complication of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). A large number of infants receiving TPN in an NICU were noted to have metabolic acidosis. We evaluated the effect of lowering the chloride intake on the incidence of metabolic acidosis in low birth weight (LBW) infants on TPN. Standard TPN solutions were adjusted to provide about 2-3 mEq/kg/day chloride instead of 5-7 mEq/kg/day provided previously. Most infants on TPN received approximately another 1-3 mEq/kg/day from intravenous and arterial line flushes with normal saline. Ten infants who had been on the original TPN solutions were compared to 10 infants who were on the revised TPN solutions. Serum pH, bicarbonate, and base deficit were used to measure acidosis. Medical records were reviewed for the number of days the infants had abnormal values. Serum chloride levels were also recorded. While similar in gestational age, birth weight, age during study period, days on TPN, and days on orally supplemented parenteral nutrition, the group with higher chloride intake had significantly more days of metabolic acidosis. They also had significantly higher serum chlorides. It is concluded that a total chloride load in excess of 6 mEq/kg/day in LBW infants receiving TPN is associated with more metabolic acidosis. Also, if saline is used for clearing of intravenous and arterial lines, standard TPN solutions should be formulated with consideration of the total chloride load.\r"

  ".W": "In the past, weight and weight gain have been the two parameters used frequently in neonatal units to monitor nutrition among high-risk infants. Our investigation sought to assess how several anthropometric measures (weight, length, head circumference, arm:head circumference ratio, and tricep skinfold) and serum albumin, transthyretin, and transferrin concentrations reflect protein and energy intake. After monitoring 42 preterm and 40 sick infants over 3 consecutive weeks, we found that transthyretin concentration proved the only serum protein which accurately measured energy and protein intakes in less than 1 week from dietary manipulation. Among preterm infants, as protein and energy intakes rose, transthyretin concentration increased significantly (p less than 0.001). Preterm infants ingested 79 +/- 39 kcal/kg/day and 2.04 +/- 1.02 g protein/kg/day at the first assessment point after birth and rose to 103 +/- 34 kcal/kg/day and 2.64 +/- 0.94 g protein/kg/day. Likewise, transthyretin measured 10.83 +/- 3.91 mg/dl at the initial measurement and rose to 14.80 +/- 4.44 at the second measurement time. Although protein intakes measured slightly lower in the sick group, their intakes correlated to transthyretin concentration (assessment time 1, r = 0.39; time 2, r = 0.33; time 3, r = 0.33). Thus, transthyretin concentration in neonatal infants offers a rapid, accurate, and moderately inexpensive way to monitor protein-energy adequacy.\r"

Sixty patients randomly received either a 1-mg daily iv injection (iv group) or a 10-mg weekly injection group (im group). Efficacy was determined by the prolongation of twice-weekly prothrombin (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin (APTT) times. The prolongation of both was not significantly different between the im and iv groups. The percent of PTs outside the normal range was not different for the two groups, although the iv group had more APTT values outside the range than did the im group (p = 0.002). The number of adverse reactions reported in the iv (5) and im (4) groups was also similar. Reactions were minor, not reproducible, and all patients recovered without sequelae. PT results from the iv and im groups were combined and compared to values from 28 patients in an earlier study who did not receive vitamin K. PTs in the no-vitamin K group were significantly prolonged over the vitamin K group (p = 0.0004). The results confirm that regular addition of vitamin K to TPN regimens decreases the incidence of elevated PTs. When administered appropriately, iv and im administration of vitamin K appear to be equally safe and effective in maintaining normal PTs and APTTs.\r"

  ".W": "During a cumulated survey of 286 months, covering 11 gastroenterological patients under nocturnal-cyclic home parenteral nutrition, 24 cases of catheter-related sepsis were observed (one/11.9 months). None of these were associated with focus of infection at the cutaneous entry point or at the subcutaneous tunnel of the catheters. In this study attempt was made to control sepsis without removal of the surgically implanted siliconed lines (Vygon code 180-20 with an internal filling volume of 1 ml). The first two catheter-sepsis were conventionally treated with systemic antibiotics for 3 weeks which meant a 1-month hospital admission each time. Consequently, we used a new antibiotic therapy consisting of locking 12 hr/day 2 ml of highly concentrated antibiotic solution within the catheter. After identification of bacterial strains by blood cultures, the antibiotic lock-technique was daily applied either alone for 16 days (group I, n = 11) or for 12 days following a 3-day course of systemic antibiotics (group II, n = 11). After starting antibiotics via the infected line, the time taken for fever abatement and for obtaining negative in-line blood cultures were 2 and 4 days, respectively, and identical in group I and II. Failure of antibiotic treatment leading to catheter withdrawal was observed once in each group (9%) and was due to secondary candida catheter-sepsis. The time for hospital stay was shorter p less than 0.02 in group I (4 days) than in group II (7 days). Antibiotic-lock technique was then applied by trained patients at home.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of five types of catheters (polyethylene, polyurethane, silicone, TFE Teflon, and FEP Teflon) on the vein wall and on the blood flow were compared. Experiments were performed on rabbits in which catheters were inserted into the vena cava. Five series of experiments were performed, each including five animals with the same type of catheter. After 10 days, venograms of the vena cava were performed, animals were then killed and the vena cava was removed with the catheter in situ. The vein and the catheter were macroscopically examined; in cases with thrombosis the clot was weighed. The vein wall and the catheter were examined by conventional microscopy and by electron microscopy, respectively. Obstruction of the venous lumen were significantly more frequent with the rigid catheters than with the soft catheters (p less than 0.001). The most extensive thromboses occurred with the Teflon catheters. The incidence of fibrin sleeves was significantly higher with the soft catheters than with the rigid ones (p less than 0.01). The venographic and macroscopic findings were in agreement in 60-100% of the cases according to the degree of venous obstruction. Catheter surfaces remained unchanged in all cases. The polyethylene catheters induced the most severe intimal inflammatory reactions. Thrombus formation was caused by two mechanisms depending on catheter composition: (1) turbulence caused by the catheter in the blood stream, and (2) platelet aggregation and subsequently, fibrin deposition on the surface of the catheter.\r"

Furthermore, in one of these subgroups which was fed on F diet, the urinary output of 3-Mehis was measured both while the subject was kept at bed rest and while the subject was allowed to live a normal life. From these measurements the standard value was determined for the urine 3-Mehis level and the 3-Mehis/Cr ratio in 24-hr urine in healthy adult human subjects of both sexes. In nine patients maintained on TPN these indices of nutritional status were measured before and at 4 weeks of TPN. The time course of the indices was also investigated. The results obtained suggest that both the urinary output of 3-Mehis and the 3-Mehis/Cr ratio can provide a sensitive index of the status of protein nutrition.\r"

This study evaluated the efficacy of water- (Soluvit) and fat-soluble (Vitalipid) vitamin supplementation in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition using the three in one 3-liter bag system. All patients received water-soluble vitamin supplements daily. Fat-soluble vitamin supplements were administered on a daily or twice weekly basis. Twenty-two patients were studied. In seven of the 22 patients vitamin status was assessed on more than one occasion during TPN support, thus bringing the total number of observations to 30. The mean duration of TPN support was 35 days. Eight of the observations were made during less than 10 days, three between 11-19 days, 15 between 20-60 days, and four during more than 60 days of TPN support. Biochemical deficiency as judged by subnormal enzyme activity or vitamin levels were present in 10% of the patients for thiamin, 3% for riboflavin, and 6% for nicotinic acid. By contrast 83% of the patients had low plasma vitamin C and B6 levels. Low plasma vitamin A and E levels were also present in 43 and 40% of the patients, respectively. According to the plasma concentrations of the vitamins studied it would appear that the commercial vitamin preparations used in this study are inadequate in maintaining optimal vitamin status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine AVP at a concentration of 1 X 10(-10) M or higher significantly increased cellular cAMP levels in a dose-dependent manner. The stimulation by AVP of cellular cAMP production was significantly attenuated by 1 X 10(-6) M somatostatin (1 X 10(-9) M AVP, 477.5 +/- 23.0 vs. 292.4 +/- 28.5 fmol/micrograms protein per 10 min, P less than 0.01). When the cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin, pertussis toxin completely abolished the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on cellular cAMP production in response to AVP. Such an effect was obtained with a concentration of 0.1 ng/ml or higher of pertussis toxin and an incubation time of longer than an hour. The exposure of cells to 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for two hours recovered the cellular cAMP response to 1 X 10(-9) M AVP in the presence of 1 X 10(-6) M somatostatin, the value of which 527.1 +/- 32.6 fmol/micrograms protein per 10 minutes, was a comparable level to that in response to only 1 X 10(-9) M AVP. Also, somatostatin inhibited the cellular cAMP response to glucagon and cholera toxin, but did not inhibit basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. Pertussis toxin treatment of cells completely abolished these inhibitory effects of somatostatin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The gamma G6 antibody-reactive cells revealed carbonic anhydrase activity, showing one of the characteristics of intercalated (IC) cells. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that IC cells in cortical CT consist of the gamma G6 antibody-reactive and non-reactive cells, whereas all IC cells in medullary CT were reactive with the gamma G6 antibody. We used a cell sorter to enrich this cell type from the isolated kidney cell suspension. When we measured hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase (ACase) activities of the sorted cells, the presence of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and isoproterenol (ISO) almost doubled ACase activities when compared with the basal values; however, no additive effect of PTH and ISO was observed. They showed no calcitonin-sensitive ACase and negligible arginine vasopressin (AVP)-sensitive ACase. We suggest that the IC cells recognized by the gamma G6 monoclonal antibody possess a receptor(s) for PTH and/or ISO but not for AVP in the CNT and CT, although it remains to be clarified whether the reactivities to PTH and ISO in these cells originate from single or dual cells.\r"

Lambda light chain IF was demonstrated in all biopsy specimens and kappa light chain IF in 11 renal biopsy specimens. The majority of renal biopsies showed a predominance of lambda light chain IF staining in the mesangial deposits. The concentration of individual immunoglobulins and their light chain fractions, and the kappa/lambda ratio were determined in the serum and the supernate from peripheral blood mononuclear cells culture of 30 IgA nephritic patients and 30 age-matched healthy controls. The IgA nephritic patients had a higher serum concentration of total IgA (P less than 0.001) and a significantly lower IgA kappa/lambda ratio (P less than 0.001) compared with the controls. The kappa/lambda ratio of supernatant IgA from IgA nephritic patients (N = 20) was also significantly lower than that of the normal subjects (N = 14), both in the unstimulated (P less than 0.01) and pokeweed mitogen stimulated, peripheral blood mononuclear-cell culture (P less than 0.05).

Paired iliac crest, transiliac and tibial bone biopsies from these cadavers indicated that in bone biopsy specimens the lead/calcium ratio is more reproducible than the absolute lead concentration. There were no significant differences between the lead/calcium ratios from the iliac crest, transiliac, or tibial specimens. Transiliac bone biopsies from 35 patients (13 patients showing symptoms of slight or moderate degree of renal failure, medical history of gout and/or arterial hypertension and 22 lead workers with chelatable lead in excess of 1000 micrograms) indicated that the lead and the lead/calcium ratio in bone biopsies reflect body lead stores as estimated by the EDT A test (r = 0.87 and 0.83, respectively). Chemical and histological studies of transiliac biopsies previously obtained from 153 dialysis patients (from 8 dialysis centers from Belgium, France and Germany) for studies of aluminum-induced bone disease showed that chronic renal failure and dialysis do not cause accumulation of lead in bone and elevated bone lead does not appear to alter trabecular bone histomorphometry. We found that in 5% of the hemodialysis population studied, bone lead concentrations approximated levels found in active lead workers.\r"

In this study we compared the biochemical composition of 12 bronchial carcinoid tumors with the biochemical composition of a rare mucoepidermoid adenoma of the bronchus. Electron microscopy revealed that some cells of the mucoepidermoid adenoma contained mucin and tonofilaments; none of the cells contained neurosecretory granules. The MAO activity of the bronchial carcinoid tumors was much higher than the MAO activity of the mucoepidermoid adenoma. Thus, there are distinctive ultrastructural and biochemical differences in these two types of bronchial adenomas.\r"

Using indirect immunofluorescence, we have observed induction of the HLA-DR glycoprotein in selected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tissue cultures treated with recombinant interferon gamma. This occurs in concert with growth arrest and morphological changes after rHuIFN-gamma treatment. This report describes the induction of a surface antigen that may have profound prognostic significance. Understanding the kinetics of HLA-DR induction will aid in the design and assessment of adoptive immunotherapy with rHuIFN-gamma.\r"

A tissue-equivalent plastic/steel model, simulating the characteristics of a stainless steel, reconstructed mandible, was irradiated and measurements were made with a parallel plate ionization chamber. The results of our measurements show that irradiation of an implanted steel plate results in an overdosage (120%) \"in front\" and an underdosage (80%) \"behind\" the steel plate. The regions of overdosage and underdosage are 2 to 3 mm thick. The overall dose modification is greatly reduced when two opposing fields are used. We conclude that irradiation of a stainless steel, reconstructed mandible with a 6-mV photon beam through opposing fields does not significantly alter the amount of radiation delivered to surrounding tissues.\r"

Patients with the disorder have no HLA-DR, DQ, or DP antigens or mRNAs in their peripheral-blood lymphocytes. The affected gene is a recessive, transacting regulatory gene that controls the expression of Class II genes. We studied the regulation of HLA Class II gene expression with the use of established Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines and skin fibroblast lines from a group of patients with SCID. Lymphoblastoid B-cell lines from the patients contained no mRNA for HLA-DR, DQ, and DP alpha and beta polypeptides, but did express mRNA for the HLA-associated invariant chain, which is normally coregulated with HLA Class II antigens. In the B-cell line from one patient, a very low amount of DR mRNA could be detected, indicating some heterogeneity in SCID. The lymphokine gamma-interferon, a strong inducer of Class II genes in a variety of normal cells, did not restore Class II gene expression in any of the SCID B-cell lines. More important, gamma-interferon was unable to induce any Class II mRNA in fibroblast lines from patients with SCID, in contrast to the efficient induction observed in normal fibroblasts. The invariant-chain gene, however, was induced in the SCID fibroblasts, confirming a unique uncoupling in the regulation of invariant and Class II genes. Thus, the genetic defect in patients with SCID affects not only the B-cell lineage but also the inducible expression of HLA Class II genes that is normally observed in Class II-negative cells, such as fibroblasts. This unresponsiveness to gamma-interferon in vitro indicates that patients with SCID will not respond to treatment with this lymphokine. Our data also increase understanding of the normal mechanisms regulating the genes for the HLA Class II cell-surface glycoproteins.\r"

We analyzed insurance claims data on 222 groups of employees and dependents for 1984 and 1985 to evaluate the effects of utilization review programs instituted by a large private insurance carrier. The utilization review programs we studied were compulsory; patients who did not follow established utilization review procedures were subject to financial penalties. Controlling for employee characteristics, health care market area factors, and benefit-plan features, we found that utilization review reduced admissions by 12.3 percent, inpatient days by 8.0 percent, hospital expenditures by 11.9 percent, and total medical expenditures by 8.3 percent. When only groups that had relatively high admission rates before adopting utilization review were analyzed, it was found that they had a 34 percent reduction in patient days and a 30 percent reduction in hospital expenditures. The savings-to-cost ratio of utilization review for groups overall was highly favorable--approximately 8 to 1. Private utilization review programs of the type we studied appear to be effective in reducing hospital use and decreasing medical expenditures. This study did not address the possible effects of such programs on the health status of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies indicate that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) gene expression can be dramatically enhanced by certain heterologous viral and chemical agents, implicating these as potential reactivating agents of latent virus infection. A common denominator shared by these agents is their ability to cause stress responses in cells. In an effort to determine whether stress responses affect HIV gene expression, we examined the effects of ultraviolet light (UV) and mitomycin C, on HIV gene expression as well as on viral growth and development. We demonstrate that these agents enhance HIV gene expression up to 150-fold. These levels are similar to those obtained by the tat gene product, the HIV trans-activating factor responsible for enhancing viral gene expression. The increase in gene expression after UV irradiation appears to require transcription but not de novo protein synthesis, and correlates with an accumulation of stable mRNA. Most importantly, UV irradiation of human T-cells prior to viral infection significantly shortens the viral growth cycle. Apparently, UV-induced cellular stress is highly conducive for viral replication and growth. We further demonstrate that even direct sunlight can activate HIV gene expression. These results demonstrate that DNA damaging agents, and perhaps other agents which elicit SOS-like stress responses in mammalian cells, can activate HIV expression thereby enhancing viral replication and development.\r"

  ".U": "88202109\r", 
  ".W": "The period (per) gene of Drosophila melanogaster is involved in the expression of circadian rhythms of locomotor activity in adult flies. Molecular studies of per (reviewed in ref. 2) have shown that the transcribed and translated products of this gene are present primarily at the embryonic, pupal and adult stages. Here we describe experiments with arrhythmic per mutants bearing an inducible form of this gene which indicate that strongly rhythmic adult behaviour can be obtained only if per expression is induced in the adult, independent of its history of expression earlier in development. Thus per-mutant locomotor-activity phenotypes seem not to result from abnormalities in the development of neural structures or in physiological processes that may be required at pre-adult stages for the expression of this circadian rhythm. Moreover, the action of per after light:dark cycle entrainment seems to be sufficient for activity rhythms to be exhibited in constant darkness; this suggests further that the per product is required only during the time that the rhythmic behaviour is being manifested. Our strategy used a heat-shock gene promotor fused to per coding sequences to obtain conditional gene expression. Heat-shock promoter-driven genes have previously been used to study the mode of action and tissue specificity of a variety of Drosophila genes; our experiments on circadian rhythms demonstrate the use of such gene constructions for the temporal manipulation of genes whose phenotypes, behavioural and otherwise, affect whole organisms.\r"

The function of BiP has been suggested to be to prevent secretion of incorrectly folded or incompletely assembled protein, to promote folding or assembly of proteins, or to solubilize protein aggregates within the ER lumen. Here we examine the interaction of BiP with newly synthesized polypeptides in an in vitro protein translation-translocation system. We find that BiP forms tight complexes with nonglycosylated yeast invertase and incorrectly disulphide-bonded prolactin, but does not associate detectably with either glycosylated invertase or correctly disulphide-bonded prolactin. Moreover, BiP associates detectably only with completed chains of prolactin, not with chains undergoing synthesis. We conclude that BiP recognizes and binds with high affinity in vitro to aberrantly folded or aberrantly glycosylated polypeptides, but not to all nascent chains as they are folding.\r"

Outside the treatment field, the dosage declines to 80% of the dose prescribed for the periphery of the lesion over a distance of 1.8 mm and to 50% over the next 3.4 mm. Localization can be accomplished via computed tomography or cerebral angiography. Treatment is accomplished with an arcing beam of photon radiation with the turntable (couch) in each of four positions. The entire system has been extensively tested for accuracy in alignment and distribution of radiation. Errors have been measured for the alignment of the apparatus and for the process of localization. Safety of operation was emphasized throughout the design and testing phase.\r"

Most of the tumors were localized within the cervical spinal cord. Nine tumors were benign gliomas: 4 ependymomas, 1 subependymoma, 3 astrocytomas, and 1 ganglioglioma. Six were removed totally, and 3 were removed subtotally. The remaining 6 tumors consisted of 3 hemangioblastomas, 1 intramedullary neurofibroma, 1 lipoma, and 1 primary intramedullary melanoma. Neurological function postoperatively compared to the preoperative function of the upper extremities was unchanged in 13 patients (86.5%), improved in 1, and worse in 1 patient. In the lower extremities, the preoperative neurological status was unchanged in 11 patients (73.3%), improved in 1 patient, and worse in 3 patients (20%). Magnetic resonance imaging was superior to myelography and computed tomography in localizing these lesions. Enhancement with paramagnetic substances (e.g., gadolinium-DTPA) helps to localize solid tumor within cysts. Histological evaluation of small tissue biopsies or frozen section histology is unreliable. The entire lesion should be exposed in all cases, and an attempt should be made to remove the tumor totally or, if this is not possible, to resect as much of the center of the tumor as is possible until the cord is decompressed. The decision to administer further treatment is based on the histological features of the tumor.\r"

The long term patency rate in the three types of anastomosis is 93%, 93%, and 100%, respectively. The time needed for the laser procedure is half to one-third of that required for the interrupted suture method. The tensile strength of the bonding site can withstand up to 250 mm Hg of arterial pressure. We have demonstrated that the CO2 laser can be used in microvascular anastomosis with or without stay sutures. Aneurysm formation is a potential risk of LAMA. Accurate coaptation of the transected vessel, precise control of laser energy, and minimal area exposed to the laser beam are the key points for further improving anastomotic quality.\r"

  ".U": "88202959\r", 
  ".W": "Pyrazolone and salicylic acid derivatives and the aniline derivative, paracetamol, are often classified as peripherally acting analgesic agents, while morphine is a centrally acting analgesic agent. Since indications exist that the non-opioid analgesic agents can also produce central effects, experiments were carried out on rats under urethane anaesthesia in which activity was recorded from single neurones in the dorsomedial part of the ventral nucleus (VDM) of the thalamus that was elicited by supramaximal electrical stimulation of nociceptive afferents in the sural nerve. In addition, activity was recorded in ascending axons of the spinal cord which was evoked by electrical stimulation of nociceptive afferents in the sural nerve. The substances studied were morphine, the pyrazolone derivatives, metamizol (dipyrone) and aminophenazone ('Pyramidon'), lysine acetylsalicylate, and paracetamol. All drugs were found to depress dose-dependently evoked activity in VDM neurones after intravenous (i.v.) injection. The ED50 of morphine in depressing evoked activity in VDM neurones is 0.05 mg/kg. Morphine also dose-dependently reduced activity in ascending axons of the spinal cord, the ED50 being 1.7 mg/kg. The ED50 of metamizol in depressing evoked activity in VDM neurones is 120 mg/kg, and that of aminophenazone is 22.7 mg/kg. The 2 ED50 values differ significantly. It has been found previously that metamizol increased nociceptive activity in some ascending axons and aminophenazone increased this activity in all ascending axons tested. The ED50 of lysine acetylsalicylate in depressing evoked activity in VDM neurones is 74 mg/kg. The drug did not reduce nociceptive activity in ascending axons of the spinal cord. The ED50 of paracetamol in depressing evoked activity in VDM neurones is 19.0 mg/kg. Paracetamol did not depress nociceptive activity in ascending axons of the spinal cord at a dose as high as 150 mg/kg administered by intraperitoneal injection. Naloxone (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) abolished the depressant effects of morphine but failed to reduce those of the non-opioid analgesic agents even at a high dose (1 mg/kg i.v.). Unlike morphine, the non-opioid analgesic agents did not completely block evoked activity in VDM neurones but only partially blocked their activation. The results suggest that the non-opioid analgesic agents tested can produce a central analgesic effect which, however, is weaker than that of morphine.\r"

Although ESWL is safe, effective, and relatively economical, one complication can be urosepsis, resulting from liberation of bacteria when the stones disintegrate. Patients who are at increased risk of infection are those who have existing urinary tract infection; perioperative urologic manipulation; infected stones; predisposition for infectious endocarditis; or multiple, large, or complex stones. If urosepsis occurs, it usually requires prolonged hospitalization, which obviates any cost-benefits that can be accrued from ESWL. Prophylactic use of an antibiotic before ESWL is rational and cost-effective. Ideally, the antibiotic should possess a spectrum of activity against the most likely bacteria to be encountered, require a limited number of doses, and offer the flexibility of sustained coverage in the event that the procedure is delayed. Our experience at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas supports the use of a long-acting cephalosporin for the prevention of infections following ESWL.\r"

The mobility and chemical shift of the N-terminal glutamic acid (335.4 ppm at pH 5.1) were found to depend on pH. It was least mobile between pH 8 and 9.0, which is explained in terms of pH-dependent conformational changes and formation of salt linkages and/or hydrogen bonds. The resonances of the lysine side chains are centered around 341.7 ppm at low pH and move upfield with pH by about 8.4 ppm with pKa values of 10.8. The exchange rates of the epsilon NH protons are lowest near their pKa values. The protein is very stable in the pH range between 4.9 and 10.0 but unfolds abruptly at pH 10.5-11. Denaturation was verified by the measurement of several parameters by NMR. The renaturation of the protein demonstrates that the folding begins with reformation of heme coordination and establishment of a hydrophobic core, followed by positioning of side chains and peptide backbones linking the nucleation centers. The repositioning processes had time scales of minutes to hours in contrast to the reported values of seconds in some studies.\r"

This screening resulted in isolation of a bacteriophage containing a 1.5-kilobase cDNA insert encoding a 71-residue polypeptide, the remainder being a large 3' terminal noncoding region. A portion of this deduced peptide sequence was identical to that of a peptide isolated from a V8 protease digest of the human erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase except for 1 residue. Antibodies purified by immunoabsorption to the fusion protein containing this cDNA-encoded polypeptide reacted only with those fragments of a limited trypsin digest of the human erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase that contain the inhibitory domain. Moreover, these antibodies were able to partially stimulate basal enzyme activity and block further activation by calmodulin. The encoded polypeptide bears homology to the glutamic acid-rich regions N-terminal to the Ca2+-binding loops of calmodulin and to a lesser extent with the loops themselves. This encoded polypeptide also represents the C terminus of the Ca2+-ATPase. Portions of the isolated cDNA were homologous to the 3' noncoding region of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase cDNA, indicating a possible mechanism for the evolution of these distinct membrane Ca2+ pumps.\r"

We have used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to examine binding of proteins to the upstream regulatory region, before and after activation with mitogens. We find two types of binding sites. One resembles an inducible enhancer element, but the protein that recognizes it is found in non-T cells and is unlikely to determine T-cell-specific expression of IL-2. A second site negatively regulates expression in resting T cells. A complex that binds to a DNA fragment containing this site is modified only when IL-2 is expressed, and it lies near a specific inducible DNase hypersensitive region. We suggest that negative regulation at this site, mediated by its associated protein(s), may contribute to the cell-specific expression of IL-2.\r"

In pure carbon dioxide, changes in cholesterol aggregate size or packing structure are observed with changing pressure. Near the critical point of carbon dioxide, cholesterol solubility is too low to permit significant aggregation, and monomeric cholesterol is observed. Addition of small amounts of dopants to supercritical carbon dioxide strongly affects cholesterol aggregation. Branched butanols (2-methyl-1-propanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol) and ethanol (to a lesser degree) promote cholesterol aggregation, while methanol, acetone, and 1-butanol do not. Cosolvents that promote aggregation also increase the rate at which cholesterol oxidase from Gloeocysticum chrysocreas catalyzes the oxidation of cholesterol. In supercritical carbon dioxide solutions, the EPR spectroscopy reveals little or no conformational change in cholesterol oxidase as 2-methyl-2-propanol or methanol is added. Damp cholesterol oxidase binds multiple cholesterol molecules; dry enzyme loses the ability to bind cholesterol. When molecular oxygen is the oxidizing agent, the rate of enzymatic cholesterol oxidation is greatly reduced in bone-dry carbon dioxide compared to that in water-saturated carbon dioxide.\r"

The dependence of the diffusion constants of three out of four tracer species upon the concentrations of four background species is accounted for semiquantitatively by a simple hard particle model. Extrapolation of model calculations to higher background concentrations suggests that in solutions containing proteins at concentrations comparable to those found in biological fluid media, the diffusive transport of larger proteins and aggregates may be slower than in dilute solution by several orders of magnitude.\r"

  ".W": "Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer was used to develop a method for introducing genes into primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes. Subconfluent monolayers of hepatocytes, cultured in hormonally defined media on different matrix substrata, were infected with helper-free stocks of a replication-defective retrovirus that constitutively expresses high levels of beta-galactosidase. Retrovirus-mediated transduction was measured by two methods: (i) an in situ cytochemical stain that specifically detects the expression of viral expressed beta-galactosidase, and (ii) Southern blot analysis, which measures the relative copy number of integrated provirus. Maximal transduction efficiency of approximately equal to 25% was achieved when the cells were infected after 3 days in culture; matrix had little effect on transduction efficiency. Enzyme cytochemical (catalase and glucose 6-phosphatase) and peroxidase immunocytochemical (asialoglycoprotein and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) analyses of the cultures indicated that greater than 95% of cells were hepatocytes. The demonstration of hepatocyte-specific organelles in cells expressing the viral-directed beta-galactosidase provided unambiguous evidence for the transduction of hepatocytes. These methods should be useful in the development of liver-directed somatic gene therapy and in the study of liver-specific gene regulation.\r"

The Drosophila gene is represented by a single locus at position 28A1-2 on chromosome 2. The gene is expressed as a 2.9-kilobase-long polyadenylylated mRNA in embryo, larval, and pupal stages. It is hardly detectable in adult flies. The longest open reading frame of the cDNA clone corresponds to a protein 469 amino acids long. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences shows that the Drosophila protein is 86 amino acids longer than its murine counterpart. In spite of the difference in length, the two proteins are highly conserved with an overall sequence homology of 54%. Both Drosophila and murine Int-1 proteins begin with a hydrophobic leader sequence and contain cysteine residues and sites for glycosylation (four in the murine protein and one in the Drosophila protein) in conserved positions, suggesting that they play important functional roles.\r"

  ".U": "88203639\r", 
  ".W": "The plasmid gene cat-86 specifies chloramphenicol-inducible chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in Bacillus subtilis. Induction by the antibiotic is primarily due to activation of the translation of cat-86-encoded mRNA. It has been suggested that the inducer stalls ribosomes at a discrete location in the leader region of cat-86 mRNA, which causes the destabilization of a downstream RNA secondary structure that normally sequesters the cat-86 ribosome binding site. It is the destabilization of this RNA secondary structure that permits translation of the cat-86 coding sequence. In the present report, we show that ribosomes that were stalled in the cat-86 leader by starvation of host cells for the amino acid specified by leader codon 6 induced gene expression to a level above that detected when cells were starved for the amino acids specified by leader codons 7 and 8. Starvation for amino acids specified by leader codons 3, 4, or 5 failed to activate cat-86 expression. These results indicate that the stalled ribosome that is most active in cat-86 induction has its aminoacyl site occupied by leader codon 6. To determine if chloramphenicol also stalled ribosomes in the cat-86 regulatory leader such that the aminoacyl site was occupied by codon 6, we separately changed leader codons 3, 4, 5, and 6 to the translation termination (ochre) codon TAA. Each of the mutated genes was tested for its ability to be induced by chloramphenicol. The results show that replacement of leader codons 3, 4, or 5 by the ochre codon blocked induction, whereas replacement of leader codon 6 by the ochre codon permitted induction. Collectively, these observations lead to the conclusion that cat-86 induction requires ribosome stalling in leader mRNA, and they identify leader codon 6 as the codon most likely to be occupied by the aminoacyl site of a stalled ribosome that is active in the induction.\r"

In a further study of G-protein diversity and signal transduction in the retina, we have identified a G-protein alpha subunit, which we refer to as Gz alpha, by isolating a human retinal cDNA clone that cross-hybridizes at reduced stringency with bovine Tr alpha-subunit cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence of Gz alpha is 41-67% identical with those of other known G-protein alpha subunits. However, the 355-residue Gz alpha lacks a consensus site for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin, and its amino acid sequence varies within a number of regions that are strongly conserved among all of the other G-protein alpha subunits. We suggest that Gz alpha, which appears to be highly expressed in neural tissues, represents a member of a subfamily of G proteins that mediate signal transduction in pertussis toxin-insensitive systems.\r"

This analysis reveals the presence of several control regions on the 5' side of the gene. Sequences between base pair (bp) -873 and bp -353 have a negative function in human and mouse fibroblasts but not in the mouse macrophage line WEHI-3. Additional positive and negative elements have been mapped between bp -353 and bp -38. A gamma-interferon response region has been also identified within that sequence. the 5' and 3' boundaries of the gamma-interferon response region have been located between bp -164 and bp -43. Inducible human cell lines showed the same gamma-interferon response region endpoints with the mouse cell line WEHI-3. A DNA fragment spanning the equivalent region of the mouse Ed beta gene confers gamma-interferon inducibility to the simian virus 40 and alpha-globin promoters in an orientation-independent manner. We further provide evidence that the conserved sequence motifs on the 5' side of all major histocompatibility complex class II genes are indispensable for gamma-interferon induction.\r"

  ".W": "Because cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) may be important for preventing direct cell-to-cell transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the agent responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, we have begun to investigate the epitope specificity and immune response (Ir) gene control of anti-HIV CTL responses in experimental animals. Mice were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the HIV gp160 envelope gene, and the primed lymphocytes were restimulated in vitro with a transfected histocompatible cell line expressing the same gene. Our results show that H-2d mice are CTL high responders and H-2k mice are low responders to the HIV gp160 envelope protein under these conditions. Moreover, the H-2d mice respond predominantly to a single immunodominant site represented by a 15-residue synthetic peptide conforming to the amphipathic alpha-helix model of T-cell epitopes and seen by CD4- CD8+ CTL in association with the Dd class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The facts that CTL responses were detected in the context of only one of four class I MHC molecules tested and that the response was limited predominantly to a single epitope indicate that the CTL repertoire elicited by the HIV envelope protein in association with murine class I MHC molecules may be very limited. In addition, this epitope occurs in a highly variable segment of the envelope protein. This puts constraints on the use of a single peptide sequence from this region in a vaccine, as such a vaccine would have to be polyvalent. Nevertheless, this same variability suggests that this region may be under selective pressure from human CTL, and therefore that this site may be immunodominant in humans as well as mice and so of clinical importance in vaccine development.\r"

  ".W": "Murine T and B lymphocytes can be induced to release soluble interleukin 2 receptors (IL2Rs). This receptor is believed to be a truncated form of the 55-kDa chain of the cell-membrane-associated receptor. It has been speculated that this receptor may play an important immunoregulatory role by binding to interleukin 2 (IL-2). We report here that interleukin 5 can induce normal murine B cells to release soluble IL2Rs. This extends our finding that interleukin 5 similarly can induce murine B cells to express functional cell-surface-associated IL2Rs. Two possible mechanisms of release of soluble IL2Rs have been suggested. Soluble IL2R could be synthesized as a secretory form of the receptor lacking the transmembrane domain or by cleavage of the extracellular domain of the cell-surface-associated IL2R at the cell surface. To investigate which mechanism was operative, we radioiodinated the cell surface of normal murine splenocytes that had been cultured for 1 day with Con A to stimulate the expression of cell-surface-associated IL2Rs and the release of soluble IL2Rs. Under the conditions used, radiolabeling of internal proteins was not apparent. Labeled cells were then recultured with Con A, conditioned medium was taken from replicate cultures at various times after radioiodination, and the specific radioactivity of released soluble IL2Rs was determined by ELISA and RIA. We demonstrate that the specific radioactivity and the kinetics of change of the specific radioactivity are consistent with the hypothesis that the soluble IL2Rs are derived from the cell-surface-associated IL2Rs rather than being released in a secretory form.\r"

Experiments were, therefore, designed to investigate the intracellular signaling molecules regulating the appearance of HLA class II molecules. The expression of HLA class II (DR and DQ) molecules induced by IFN-gamma was blocked by a calmodulin antagonist, W7, but not by a protein kinase C inhibitor, H7. Furthermore, a direct activator of protein kinase C, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, was unable to induce HLA class II (DR) molecule expression. These results suggest that IFN-gamma induces HLA class II molecules on HL-60 cells by way of a calcium-calmodulin pathway and not by way of a protein kinase C pathway. Calmodulin is activated by a transient rise in the cytosolic free calcium. In fact, IFN-gamma evoked a calcium influx into HL-60 cells, whereas depletion of Ca2+ from culture medium resulted in a failure of IFN-gamma to induce DR expression. Furthermore, the calcium ionophore A23187 by itself induced DR molecule expression. These results suggest that IFN-gamma stimulates calcium influx by a so-called receptor-mediated calcium channel and activates the calmodulin branch of the calcium messenger system, resulting in the induction of DR molecules on the surface of HL-60 cells.\r"

We report that TE cells directly activate double-negative thymocytes to proliferate and that TE cells enhance the ability of double-negative thymocytes to proliferate in response to stimulation with exogenous interleukin 2. Activated double-negative thymocytes that proliferated in vitro in the presence of TE cells and interleukin 2 remained double-negative after 23 days in culture. Moreover, TE-cell culture supernatants in the absence of intact TE cells contain interleukin 1, interleukin 3, and granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor activity for human bone marrow cells and can activate double-negative thymocytes to proliferate. Antibodies against interleukin 1 and against granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor inhibited TE-cell-induced thymocyte activation. These data indicate that one role of TE cells in vivo may be to activate double-negative thymocytes to proliferate.\r"

At age 17-20 days, 3 of 21 offspring born to seven females were found to have peripheral blood leukocyte counts of greater than 100,000 per mm3. Histology analyses showed extensive lymphocytic infiltration in the liver and kidney, indicating that these rabbits had a malignant lymphocytic leukemia. Genomic DNA analyses of thymus and peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed that the leukemic rabbits were transgenic and that both immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain genes were rearranged in the leukemic cells; thus, the leukemic cells are of B-cell lineage. One to four heavy and light chain gene rearrangements were observed, suggesting that the B-cell tumors were oligoclonal. Stable tissue culture cell lines from the bone marrow and peripheral blood of one of the transgenic rabbits have been developed. The development of B-cell leukemias in rabbits with the E mu-myc transgene contrasts with the development of B-cell lymphomas in mice carrying a similar transgene. The lymphomas in mice develop in adults and are monoclonal in origin. The leukemias in rabbits develop in juveniles, less than 3 weeks after birth, and appear oligoclonal in origin. The leukemias seem to develop in rabbit at a specific stage of development, and we suggest that a normal developmental signal may be involved in the oncogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical removal of one or both atrial appendages was employed in rats to reduce the intrinsic stores of atriopeptin (AP). In conscious rats (with intact baroreceptor reflexes), bilateral or unilateral atrial appendectomy suppressed the diuresis and natriuresis produced by acute volume expansion. Surprisingly, volume expansion (with 4% bovine serum albumin in saline at 1.5 ml/kg per min for 15 min) did not result in an increase in plasma AP immunoreactivity (APir) in control or atrial-appendectomized conscious rats. Previous studies demonstrated that acute volume expansion in anesthetized animals caused increased plasma APir. Indeed, we found that volume expansion causes comparable diuresis-natriuresis in conscious and chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats, but only the latter group exhibits an increase in plasma APir. Brattleboro rats, which are deficient in vasopressin, exhibit the same response as Long-Evans controls in that acute volume expansion in conscious animals produces a pronounced diuresis and natriuresis but no APir release, but when these same animals are anesthetized, there is a simultaneous induction of diuresis-natriuresis and APir release by volume expansion. Plasma AP does not increase in conscious rats despite a large volume load, 30-40% of the total blood volume given in 15 min, and the natriuresis-diuresis appears to also be independent of vasopressin. On the other hand, the diuresis induced by acute volume expansion in anesthetized rats seems dependent on the elevated APir, since rats made autoimmune to AP (which are nonresponsive to exogenous AP infusions) exhibit a diuresis in conscious but not anesthetized rats. We therefore conclude that the participation of AP in volume homeostasis is more likely in pathophysiological states and that another mechanism or possibly another atrial factor mediates the diuresis-natriuresis induced by volume expansion in conscious rats.\r"

A recombinant DNA epitope library was constructed from short, random FVIII cDNA fragments and immunologically screened with C5 to identify bacteriophage expressing the antigenic determinant. The isolation and characterization of immunoreactive bacteriophage restricted the C5 epitope to the overlapping or shared DNA sequence of nine different clones and corresponded to amino acid residues 338-362 of the mature FVIII peptide. The defined epitope is between the proposed activated protein C cleavage site (Arg-336) and thrombin cleavage site (Arg-372) on the amino-terminal 90-kDa FVIII heavy-chain subunit. The identification of the epitope of an inhibiting anti-FVIII antibody between two critical cleavage sites suggests that this amino acid sequence plays a role in regulating FVIII coagulant activity.\r"

To study the relationship between structure and antigenicity, a hybrid virus was constructed in which N-AgI of PV-1 was replaced by N-AgI of PV-3. PV-3- and PV-1-specific antisera, including those elicited by PV-3 in primates, neutralized the hybrid virus. Injection of the hybrid virus into rabbits or into primates resulted in the production of antisera that neutralized both PV-1 and PV-3.

  ".W": "Immortalized cell lines have been generated from embryonic mouse neuroepithelium by infection with a retrovirus containing the c-myc oncogene. The morphology and the antigenic phenotype of the cloned cell lines are characteristic of normal neuroepithelium. Although the cell lines are stable and do not spontaneously differentiate, morphological changes can be induced with both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor. Fibroblast growth factor at 5 ng/ml stimulates differentiation of the neuroepithelial cells, and it has been shown that the cloned cell line 2.3D can differentiate into astrocytes, containing glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurons, expressing the A2B5 marker and neurofilaments. This indicates that some cells in the neuroepithelium at embryonic day 10 are multipotent and are not restricted to either the glial or neuronal cell lineage. The cell lines also can be induced with interferon gamma to express class I and class II histocompatibility antigens. The response of the c-myc-immortalized cell lines to these two factors is similar to that observed with freshly isolated neuroepithelium and suggests that such immortalized precursor populations are representative of the cells found in the developing neuroepithelium.\r"

  ".W": "Classical and anaplastic seminoma are traditionally treated with radiation therapy and are said to have the same prognosis. A retrospective study was undertaken of 90 seminoma patients treated with radiation therapy between 1961 and 1985. The classical group consisted of 71 patients of whom 50 had stage I and 21 had stage II disease. The anaplastic group consisted of 19 patients of whom ten had stage I and nine had stage II disease. The median follow-up time was 64 months for the entire group. The 10-year relapse-free survival rate for the classical group was 94% and for the anaplastic group was 70% (P less than .05). For patients with classical stage I disease, the relapse-free actuarial survival rate was 98%; for patients with anaplastic stage I disease, it was 64% (P less than .02). For the classical stage II disease group, the relapse-free actuarial survival rate was 84% and for the anaplastic stage II disease group, 75% (P less than .70). Four patients in the classical group (6%) had relapses; of these, one patient had local recurrence of tumor, and three had distant metastases. In the anaplastic group, four patients (21%) had relapses; two patients had local recurrence of tumor, and two had distant metastases. Therefore the data suggest a difference in survival and relapse rates between classical and anaplastic seminoma.\r"

Earlier studies indicated that the direct DNA oxidant is a derivative of hydrogen peroxide whose formation is dependent on cell metabolism. The generation of this oxidant depends on the availability of both reducing equivalents and an iron species, which together mediate a Fenton reaction in which ferrous iron reduces hydrogen peroxide to a reactive radical. An in vitro Fenton system was established that generates DNA strand breaks and inactivates bacteriophage and that also reproduces the suppression of DNA damage by high concentrations of peroxide. The direct DNA oxidant both in vivo and in this in vitro system exhibits reactivity unlike that of a free hydroxyl radical and may instead be a ferryl radical.\r"

Calcium release from intracellular storage sites was monitored with fura-2, a fluorescent indicator. The dependence of the rate of calcium release on the concentration of added IP3 in the 4 to 40 nM range showed that channel opening requires the binding of at least three molecules of IP3. Channel opening occurred in the absence of added adenosine triphosphate, indicating that IP3 acts directly on the channel or on a protein that gates it. The channels were opened by IP3 in less than 4 seconds. The highly cooperative opening of calcium channels by nanomolar concentrations of IP3 enables cells to detect and amplify very small changes in the concentration of this messenger in response to hormonal, sensory, and growth control stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "Pertussis toxin is produced by the causative agent of whooping cough, Bordetella pertussis, and is an adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase capable of covalently modifying and thereby inactivating many eukaryotic G proteins involved in cellular metabolism. The toxin is a principal determinant of virulence in whooping cough and is a primary candidate for an acellular pertussis vaccine, yet it is unclear whether the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity is required for both pathogenic and immunoprotective activities. A B. pertussis strain that produced an assembled pertussis holotoxin with only 1 percent of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the native toxin was constructed and was found to be deficient in pathogenic activities associated with B. pertussis including induction of leukocytosis, potentiation of anaphylaxis, and stimulation of histamine sensitivity. Moreover, this mutant strain failed to function as an adjuvant and was less effective in protecting mice from intracerebral challenge infection. These data suggest that the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity is necessary for both pathogenicity and optimum immunoprotection. These findings bear directly on the design of a nontoxic pertussis vaccine.\r"

Lysine codons and lysine- and tryptophan-encoding oligonucleotides were introduced at several positions into a 19-kilodalton zein complementary DNA by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. A 450-base pair open reading frame from a simian virus 40 (SV40) coat protein was also engineered into the zein coding region. Messenger RNAs for the modified zeins were synthesized in vitro with an SP6 RNA polymerase system and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. The modifications did not affect the translation, signal peptide cleavage, or stability of the zeins. The ability of the modified zeins to assemble into structures similar to maize protein bodies was assayed by two criteria: assembly into membrane-bound vesicles resistant to exogenously added protease, and ability to self-aggregate into dense structures. All of the modified zeins were membrane-bound; only the one containing a 17-kilodalton SV40 protein fragment was unable to aggregate. These findings suggest that it may be possible to create high-lysine corn by genetic engineering.\r"

These characteristics suggested that proteosomes may serve as carrier proteins and adjuvants to enhance peptide immunogenicity. Although high titers of malaria circumsporozoite (CS) antibodies protect against malaria, vaccines thus far tested in humans have been insufficiently immunogenic to be clinically useful. Here it is shown that synthetic CS peptides hydrophobically complexed to proteosomes by way of lauroyl-cysteine become highly immunogenic in mice without other adjuvants. The high titers of antibodies produced and the safety of proteosomes in humans suggest that this novel system is widely applicable for the development of peptide vaccines to protect against many diseases.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in the protection of body composition, when given as an adjuvant to CVB (cisplatin-vinblastine-bleomycin) treatment to patients with testicular teratocarcinoma, was investigated. Twenty-three patients without previous malnutrition were randomized to receive either TPN or spontaneous oral intake only during their hospital stay, in the course of a total treatment period of 10 weeks. The patients spent weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10 in the hospital to undergo chemotherapy. Energy and nitrogen intakes were profoundly decreased in the spontaneous oral-intake group, whereas the intakes decreased in the TPN group only at home when they relied on oral intake. In spite of the cytotoxic drugs, the TPN group remained in nitrogen balance when undergoing TPN at the hospital. However, they lost substantial body weight and body nitrogen over 10 weeks when compared with the oral-intake group. This loss in body mass was mainly a result of the prolonged anorexia that all the patients had after weekly termination of chemotherapy. This study demonstrates that well-nourished patients can use intravenous nutrition even while receiving cytocidal and cytostatic drug administration. However, intermittent periods of adequate nutrition in the hospital had only a marginal impact, since the positive effects of nutrition were offset by the pronounced anorexia that occurred in all patients outside the hospital for a considerable time after cytostatic treatment.\r"

Sixty percent of the patients in the series were at significant risk of myocardial infarction, including 25 with an EF from 35% to 60% and seven with an EF less than 35%; the perioperative myocardial infarction rate was zero. Nitroglycerine-induced volume loading in this series allowed aortic aneurysmorrhaphy without any decrease in ventricular function at the critical points of anesthetic induction, aortic cross clamping, or declamping; such optimization of myocardial performance appears to prevent perioperative myocardial infarction, even in high-risk patients.\r"

  ".U": "88205181\r", 
  ".W": "We performed a series of isotopic studies on the role of alpha- or beta-adrenergic activity in the regulation of glucose and protein metabolism in a group of surgical patients receiving total parenteral nutrition. We quantitated rates of glucose turnover and net protein breakdown by the primed constant infusion of 3H-glucose and 14C-urea, respectively. Basal measurements were first performed, and then the effect of either alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockade was assessed by means of the constant infusion of either phentolamine or propranolol. In addition, we assessed the effect of beta-stimulation by infusing the beta-agonist, salbutamol. The institution of alpha-adrenergic blockade did not significantly alter either the plasma glucose level or the rate of glucose production. However, the rate of net protein catabolism decreased significantly after alpha-adrenergic blockade. Before alpha-blockade the value for NPC was 0.88 +/- 0.27 gm/kg/day, and after alpha-blockade the corresponding value was 0.73 +/- 0.24 gm/kg/day (p less than 0.01). beta-Adrenergic blockade resulted in a decrease in the rate of glucose appearance from 38.2 +/- 6.1 mumol/kg/min to 35.1 +/- 5.7 mumol/kg/min, and the plasma glucose clearance increased from 5.0 +/- 0.8 ml/kg/min to 5.4 +/- 0.8 ml/kg/min. As a result of these changes the plasma glucose concentration decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) from 7.4 +/- 0.3 mumol/ml to 6.5 +/- 0.5 mumol/ml. beta-Adrenergic blockade did not significantly decrease the rate of net protein catabolism. beta-Stimulation with salbutamol resulted in a significant increase (p less than 0.05) in the rate of glucose production from 31.3 +/- 4.2 mumol/kg/min to 38.0 +/- 6.5 mumol/kg/min, and as a result the plasma glucose level increased significantly from 6.7 +/- 0.6 mumol/ml to 7.4 +/- 0.6 mumol/ml (p less than 0.04). We conclude from these studies that the role of the adrenergic nervous system in the promotion of endogenous glucose turnover in surgical patients receiving total parenteral nutrition is primarily a beta-adrenergic effect, whereas the promotion of protein catabolism is mainly an alpha-adrenergic effect.\r"

The development of carcinoma is a recognized risk in patients with choledochal cysts that mandates cyst excision, rather than bypass, whenever possible. The literature regarding choledochal cysts in pregnancy is reviewed. Pregnant patients with choledochal cysts require careful management so as to avoid cyst rupture; and cesarean section is preferable to normal vaginal delivery in most cases. Although the preferred management of a choledochal cyst is excision and Roux-en-Y reconstruction, this may have to be deferred until after delivery, depending on gestation age, because of the risk of fetal mortality and maternal morbidity that is associated with this procedure.\r"

An inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, indomethacin (10(-5) M), prevented excitatory responses to A23187, arachidonic acid, and acetylcholine but did not alter contractions caused by KCl. An inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase, dazoxiben (10(-4) M), significantly reduced endothelium-dependent contractions to A23187 and arachidonic acid but did not significantly affect contractions caused by acetylcholine. These results demonstrate that A23187, arachidonic acid, and acetylcholine cause excitatory endothelium-dependent responses in canine cerebral blood vessels by increasing the release of product(s) of cyclooxygenase from endothelial cells; in the case of A23187 and arachidonic acid, thromboxane A2 contributes to the endothelium-dependent contractions.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of mannitol, nimodipine, and indomethacin on ischemic neuronal injury were examined in 45 rats divided equally into nine groups subjected to 10 minutes of forebrain ischemia. Of two control groups, one received maintenance fluids while the other received a normal saline bolus. In the remaining seven groups, mannitol, nimodipine, and indomethacin were administered singly or in combination 5 minutes before forebrain ischemia. Seven days after ischemia, the brains were perfusion-fixed, sectioned coronally into 2.8-mm slices, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Ischemic neurons were directly counted on predetermined regions of standardized serial sections. Considerable amelioration of ischemic injury (ischemic neurons/total neurons) was observed with mannitol (ischemic injury, 7 +/- 5% in the hippocampal CA1/CA2 sectors and 28 +/- 17% in the CA3 sector). This is in contrast to control values of 64 +/- 11% and 80 +/- 6%, respectively, and those obtained in the normal saline group of 70 +/- 10% and 59 +/- 13%, respectively. The beneficial effect with nimodipine reached significance in only the hippocampal CA3 sector (ischemic injury, 35 +/- 21%). Indomethacin showed no significant benefit. Combining the agents resulted in significantly reduced neuronal injury compared with control groups, although the effect was not greater than that achieved with mannitol alone. The degree of ischemic injury was least when all three agents were used in combination (ischemic injury, 12 +/- 12% in the hippocampal CA1/CA2 sectors and 4 +/- 4% in the CA3 sector). Our data support the concept that successfully blocking the ischemic cascade with a single, diversely acting agent or multiple agents will evoke the best beneficial response.\r"
