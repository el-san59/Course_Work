  ".W": "Identification of suspected pericardial tamponade and the decision to perform invasive drainage of the pericardial space have historically been based on classic bedside findings. Two-dimensional echocardiography has improved detection of pericardial effusion, but it may be excessively sensitive in evaluation of patients for hemodynamic embarrassment. Therefore, 50 consecutive medical patients were examined who were identified by echocardiography to have probable tamponade (defined as the presence of right heart chamber collapse in the presence of a pericardial effusion) and who underwent combined right-sided cardiac catheterization and percutaneous pericardiocentesis. All patients had elevated pericardial pressure. However, many had minimal evidence of hemodynamic compromise (94% had systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg and 58% had a cardiac index greater than or equal to 2.3 liters/min per m2). Pericardiocentesis resulted in hemodynamic improvement, but frequently did not alleviate dyspnea or correct tachycardia. Patients with malignancy as the cause of tamponade had a high mortality rate (the cumulative probability of survival in such patients was only 17% at 1 year). Echocardiographically assisted diagnosis of pericardial tamponade in medical patients results in the identification of a substantial subset of patients with only subtle evidence of hemodynamic compromise. This subset of patients differs sharply from medical patients described in previous reports with classic tamponade. Although the patients can be managed by invasive catheter pericardiocentesis with few complications, the natural history and the optimal management strategy for this group are not resolved.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnostic yield of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography for identifying a cardiac source of embolism was compared in 79 patients presenting with unexplained stroke or transient ischemic attack. There were 35 men and 44 women with a mean age of 59 years (range 17 to 84); 52% had clinical cardiac disease. Both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms were performed using Doppler color flow and contrast imaging. Transesophageal echocardiography identified a potential cardiac source of embolism in 57% of the overall study group compared with only 15% by transthoracic echocardiography (p less than 0.0005). Compared with transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography more frequently identified atrial septal aneurysm associated with a patent foramen ovale (9 versus 1 of 79 patients, p less than 0.005), left atrial thrombus or tumor (6 versus 0 of 79 patients, p less than 0.05) and left atrial spontaneous contrast (13 versus 0 of 79 patients, p less than 0.0005). All cases of left atrial thrombus or spontaneous contrast were identified in patients with clinically identified cardiac disease. In the 38 patients with no cardiac disease, transesophageal echocardiography identified isolated atrial septal aneurysm and atrial septal aneurysm with a patent foramen ovale more frequently than transthoracic echocardiography (8 versus 2 of 38 patients, p less than 0.05). The two techniques had a similar rate of identifying apical thrombus and mitral valve prolapse. Overall, transesophageal echocardiography identified abnormalities in 39% of patients with no cardiac disease versus 19% for transthoracic echocardiography (p less than 0.005). Thus, transesophageal echocardiography identifies potential cardiac sources of embolism in the majority of patients presenting with unexplained stroke.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although embolization can occur from atherosclerotic debris within the thoracic aorta, it is not commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of the source of a systemic embolism. In the current study, the prevalence, clinical significance and embolic potential of intraaortic atherosclerotic debris as detected by transesophageal echocardiography was determined. Intraaortic atherosclerotic debris was identified in 38 (7%) of 556 patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography. An embolic event occurred among 11 (31%) of the 36 study patients with intraaortic atherosclerotic debris. The incidence of an embolic event was higher when the debris was pedunculated and highly mobile (8 [73%] of 11 patients) than when it was layered and immobile (3 [12%] of 25 patients) (p less than 0.002). Among 15 patients undergoing an invasive procedure of the aorta, the incidence of embolism was 27%. In conclusion, in a patient with an embolic event, the thoracic aorta should be considered as a potential source. Transesophageal echocardiography can reliably detect intraaortic atherosclerotic debris, and when it is identified, an invasive aortic procedure should be avoided if possible.\r"

  ".U": "91100652\r", 
  ".W": "Coronary arterial remodeling is a compensatory mechanism that may limit the adverse effects of coronary obstructive lesions by expansion of the entire vascular segment. To determine if this compensatory anatomic change occurs in patients, high-frequency epicardial echocardiography using a 12 MHz transducer was performed during open heart surgery in 33 patients (10 with normal coronary arteries undergoing valvular surgery and 23 with coronary atherosclerosis). From stop-frame videotape high-frequency epicardial echocardiographic images, cross-sectional measurements of luminal area and total arterial area (lumen, intima, media and dense adventitia) were made in the patients with atherosclerosis at the site of arterial lesions and from the most proximal portion of the same artery. Remodeling was defined as enlargement of the total arterial area. In normal arteries measurements were made from proximal and midarterial locations. In the patients with normal coronary arteries, total arterial area, as determined by high-frequency echocardiography, decreased from the proximal site to the midportion of the artery (from 10.4 +/- 0.9 to 8.4 +/- 1.0 mm2, p less than 0.05); luminal area also decreased (from 6.0 +/- 0.6 to 4.5 +/- 0.7 mm2, p less than 0.05). In patients with coronary arterial lesions, luminal area also decreased from the proximal site to the arterial lesion site (from 5.3 +/- 0.6 to 2.3 +/- 0.3 mm2, p less than 0.05), but total arterial area increased (from 11.6 +/- 1.0 to 13.0 +/- 1.0 mm2, p less than 0.05). Of the 25 coronary arteries evaluated, only 4 had angiographic evidence of coronary collateral formation. These data indicate that coronary arterial remodeling is an important compensatory mechanism in obstructive coronary disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Demonstration of disordered blood flow in a coronary artery may be helpful in anticipating the presence of stenosis. To examine the possibility of disordered coronary blood flow associated with left main coronary stenosis, left main coronary flow was visualized by transesophageal Doppler color flow echocardiography in 52 patients undergoing coronary angiography. Twenty patients had significant left main coronary stenosis (Group 1) and 32 patients did not (Group 2). Adequate two-dimensional echocardiographic images of the left main coronary artery were obtained in 17 patients in Group 1 and 30 patients in Group 2. Sixteen patients in Group 1, including five patients in whom the stenosis could not clearly be defined by two-dimensional echocardiography, exhibited the aliased reddish-yellowish elements producing the mosaic pattern at the stenotic or poststenotic segments, or both. In contrast, nonaliased bluish jets, suggesting laminar flow away from the transducer, were seen in echocardiograms from 27 patients in Group 2. This group included four patients with stenosis-like images on two-dimensional echocardiography. The aliased mosaic pattern was found in only three patients in Group 2 (p less than 0.01). Thus, sensitivity to detect the stenosis was improved when Doppler color flow imaging was applied. Flow velocity was significantly higher at the site of stenosis in patients in Group 1 (116 +/- 28 cm/s, n = 10, mean +/- SD) than in Group 2 (29 +/- 12 cm/s, n = 21, p less than 0.01), suggesting that the augmentation of flow velocity with or without turbulence due to the stenosis contributed to the appearance of the mosaic flow images.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With use of a xenon chloride (308 nm) excimer laser generator and 1.5 to 1.75 mm catheters, excimer laser angioplasty was attempted at 135 ns pulse width, 25 to 40 Hz repetition rate, 2 to 5 s laser delivery time and 30 to 60 mJ/mm2 energy fluence. Laser success (greater than 20% reduction in absolute percent diameter stenosis) was achieved in 41 (75%) of 55 lesions, with 100% subsequent balloon angioplasty success (less than 50% residual stenosis). By quantitative digital caliper technique, the percent diameter stenosis (mean +/- SE) was reduced from 81 +/- 1% to 50 +/- 3% after excimer laser angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and to 20 +/- 1% after balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001); minimal luminal diameter increased from 0.56 +/- 0.04 to 1.46 +/- 0.08 mm (p less than 0.001) and 2.03 +/- 0.07 mm (p less than 0.001), respectively. By videodensitometric techniques, the percent area stenosis decreased from 86 +/- 2% to 54 +/- 3% after excimer angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and to 26 +/- 3% after balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001). There were no perforations, need for emergency bypass surgery or deaths. The overall incidence of abrupt closure (3.6%), dissection (1.8%), embolization (1.8%), filling defect (6%), myocardial infarction (5.5%), side branch occlusion (3.6%) or spasm (3.6%) was infrequent and more related to subsequent balloon angioplasty than to the laser procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Even in the absence of clinically significant cardiac disease, advanced age alone is often considered sufficient indication for Swan-Ganz placement, hemodynamic evaluation, adjustment of fluid states, and inotropic support. Yet data clearly documenting the need for this evaluation and therapy are difficult to obtain. All major general surgical and orthopedic operations in non-agenarians were reviewed in our institution from July 1, 1987 through December 31, 1988. Fifty-one procedures were performed on 46 patients. None of these patients had preoperative Swan-Ganz catheterization or hemodynamic evaluation. Eighteen general surgical, 30 orthopedic, 2 neurosurgical, and 1 gynecological procedures were performed. Forty-three were performed under general anesthesia, 7 under spinal anesthesia, and 1 with local anesthesia. Seven out of 51 patients (14%) experienced major complications, and 16 out of 51 (31%) experienced minor complications. Thirty-day mortality was 0%, and 6-month survival was 92%. Only one complication occurred within 48 hours of surgery that might possibly have been prevented with hemodynamic evaluation, adjustment of fluid status, inotropic support, and intensive care unit monitoring.\r"

The etiology of the PVS varied from dementia to cerebral trauma. The mean duration of the PVS was 54 +/- 8.4 months (range 12 to 204). Family members reported that they visited patients 260 times during the first year following the onset of the PVS and were still visiting at a rate of 209 visits yearly at the time of the interview. There was no significant correlation between the frequency of the family members visits and the duration of the PVS, the patient's or family member's age, or the family member's relationship to the patient. Ninety percent of patients were considered by family members to have some awareness of pain, light or darkness, environment, taste, verbal conversation, or the family member's presence. Most family members thought they understood the patient's medical condition, and the majority did not expect the patient to improve. Nevertheless, the majority of family members wanted the patient to undergo therapeutic interventions, including transfer to the acute hospital and surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, surveys of both patients and physicians suggest that mammography is underutilized. This study examined whether physicians' reported breast cancer screening practices and barriers to mammography varied with patients' age. Data from 576 primary care physicians (internal medicine, family/general practice, and obstetrics/gynecology) who participated in a mailed statewide survey were analyzed. Physicians reported screening elderly women significantly less often than younger women, regardless of family history of breast cancer. With the exception of medical specialty, physicians' demographic and practice characteristics were not associated with reported screening practices. However, physicians' knowledge and beliefs about breast cancer in older women were associated with reported screening practices. When analyzing barriers to ordering mammography, cost to the patient was viewed as a barrier for women of all ages, and pain was viewed as a greater barrier for younger women; otherwise, physicians consistently believed that their elderly patients faced considerably more barriers compared with younger women. Further investigation is required to examine why primary care physicians report age-related differences in both breast screening and barriers to mammography.\r"

However, 22% (5/23) of falls by vigorous subjects, but only 6% (5/89) of falls by frail subjects, resulted in a serious injury. Compared with frail subjects, vigorous fallers were somewhat more likely to fall during displacing activity (53% vs 31%), with an environmental hazard present (53% vs 29%), and on stairs (27% vs 6%). These findings suggest that fall-related injuries can be a serious health problem for vigorous as well as frail elderly persons. Injury prevention, therefore, should be directed at all elderly persons but tailored to expected differences in fall circumstances.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about the peripheral vascular response to posture change in very elderly people who are vulnerable to the development of orthostatic hypotension. This is due, in part, to the risks of currently utilized invasive vascular monitoring techniques in the elderly population. We studied the forearm vascular response to active standing in 18 healthy young, 10 healthy old, and 19 impaired elderly subjects, using the non-invasive technique of venous occlusion plethysmography. In six subjects this technique was compared to duplex doppler ultrasonography for the measurement of postural changes in forearm blood flow. Forearm blood flow changes determined by venous occlusion plethysmography were 11% larger than doppler measurements, but the two methods strongly correlated (r = 0.90, P less than .001). Mean forearm vascular resistance increased to a significantly greater extent at 1 minute of standing in young subjects than in both groups of old, although the response was quite variable in all groups. Two healthy elderly (20%) and eight impaired elderly (40%) subjects had unexpected forearm vasodilatation at 1 minute of standing. By 3 minutes, forearm vascular resistance had increased by similar amounts in all three groups of subjects. Five impaired elderly and no healthy young or healthy old subjects had orthostatic hypotension, defined as greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg decline in mean arterial blood pressure at 1 or 3 minutes of standing. Forearm vascular resistance changes did not correlate with blood pressure response to standing. Thus, forearm vascular response to 1 minute of active standing is attenuated in many elderly subjects. This abnormality may impair adaptation to orthostatic stress in advanced age.\r"

Using this model, we demonstrate that: 1) MHC class II-specific CD4+ T cells can cause detachment as a distinct event of the E:T interaction, although the pathways or mechanisms involved appear to be different from those utilized by MHC class I-specific CD8+ T cells; 2) detachment and lysis by CD4+ T cells are distinct activities that involve different functional requirements: 3) CD4+ T cell-induced detachment is initiated by direct cell-cell interaction, independent of TNF-alpha/beta; 4) CD4+ T cell-mediated lysis can be accomplished by TNF-alpha/beta-dependent and independent pathways; and 5) the nature of a particular target cell response to alloreactive CD4+ T cell attack reflects its intrinsic susceptibility to one or more potential effector mechanisms.\r"

It is not known whether steps involved in Ag processing also affect the recognition of alloreactive T cells. We have recently described B cell mutants which have general defects in the processing and presentation of a variety of exogenous Ag to class II restricted T cells. In this report we have studied the ability of these processing mutants to stimulate a set of anti-DR3-specific alloreactive T cells clones. These processing/presentation mutants express normal MHC class II molecules, both in terms of primary sequence and cell surface abundance, but they appear unable to generate effective peptide-MHC complexes. When tested for their ability to stimulate MHC class II alloreactive T cell clones, only one of four T cell clones was stimulated by these mutants; the other three alloreactive T cell clones were not stimulated by either of two different mutants. Both of these mutants express normal levels of the accessory molecules, LFA-3 and ICAM-1. The inability of these mutants to stimulate three of four alloreactive clones indicates that the capacity to be recognized by many alloreactive T cells is linked to the Ag processing capacity of a stimulator cell.\r"

Two-parameter immunofluorescence identified three subpopulations which were respectively IL-2R alpha-/CD3+, IL-2R alpha+/CD3-, or IL-2R alpha-/CD3-; no detectable population of IL-2R alpha+/CD3+ cells was found in unstimulated fetal thymocytes. Fractionation by \"panning\" and by sterile flow cytometric separation was used to characterize the functional responsiveness of these three subpopulations to a variety of stimuli. All three populations proliferated in response to PMA + ionomycin + rIL-2. In contrast, stimulation with anti-CD3 + IL-2 induced proliferation in IL-2R alpha-/CD3+ and IL-2R alpha-/CD3- but not in IL-2R alpha+/CD3- thymocytes. IL-2R alpha- cells, including sorted IL-2R alpha-/CD3- thymocytes, underwent a phenotypic change in response to in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3 + IL-2, resulting in the appearance of an IL-2R alpha+/CD3+ population that was not detected in freshly isolated thymocytes. The ability of fractionated fetal thymocytes to produce lymphokine in response to PMA + ionomycin was also evaluated. Only the IL-2R alpha-/CD3- fraction generated detectable IL-2. These findings demonstrate for the first time that CD3 and IL-2R alpha are expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion in fetal thymocytes and define three subpopulations of thymocytes that differ significantly in their proliferative and differentiative responses to TCR-mediated, IL-2R-mediated, and pharmacologic stimulation.\r"

It also recognizes multiple human class I molecules. The epitope recognized by this antibody maps to the class I alpha 1 domain. The activation properties of this mAb are not mediated exclusively through the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked Qa-2 molecule, as the antibody activates spleen cells from Qa-2 negative strains. Although class I molecules are not usually considered as activation Ag, these data demonstrate their potential for involvement in signal transduction.\r"

Several distinct saponins, designated QS-7, QS-17, QS-18, and QS-21, were demonstrated to boost antibody levels by 100-fold or more when used in mouse immunizations with the Ag BSA and beef liver cytochrome b5. These purified saponins increased titers in all major IgG subclasses. To determine optimal dose in mice for adjuvant response, QS-7 and QS-21 were tested in a dose-response study in intradermal immunization with BSA in mice; for both of these purified saponins, adjuvant response (determined by stimulation of ELISA titers to BSA) neared maximum at doses of 5 micrograms and was shown to plateau up to the highest dose tested, 80 micrograms. These purified saponins vary considerably in their toxicity, as assessed by lethality in mice; the main component, QS-18, being the most toxic. Saponins QS-7 and QS-21 showed no or very low toxicity in mice, respectively. None of these saponins stimulated production of reaginic antibodies. The monosaccharide composition of these saponins showed similar but distinct compositions with all four containing fucose, xylose, galactose and glucuronic acid. Predominant differences were observed in the quantities of rhamnose, arabinose, and glucose. Monomer m.w. (determined by size exclusion HPLC) were determined to range from 1800 to 2200.\r"

T cell hybridomas derived from BALB/c mice immunized with Nase were screened against a nested set of overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the entire Nase molecule. Five regions of Nase, encompassing residues 1 to 20, 21 to 40, 61 to 80, 101 to 120, and 112 to 130, were found to be the T cell determinants. Region 61 to 80 is the immunodominant site. Mutants of Nase with a single amino acid substitution outside the defined T cell determinants were tested for their ability to stimulate the T cell hybridomas. The substitution of arginine for glutamic acid at residue 43 markedly reduces the antigenic potency of the protein for I-Ed restricted T cell hybridomas, which recognize Nase peptides comprised of residues 21 to 40 (p21-40) or 112 to 130 (p112-130). In contrast, the stimulatory capacity of this mutant for I-Ad restricted T cell hybridomas remains unchanged. Our results suggest that selective regulation of an immune response may be achieved by appropriately mutagenizing protein Ag.\r"

  ".W": "It is generally believed that macrophages and dendritic cells are the major cell populations that present tolerogenic self antigens to developing thymocytes. However, it is still controversial whether self antigens expressed on thymocytes themselves work as tolerogens in the thymus. To evaluate this possibility, Thy-1 bright cells were sorted out from fetal thymus cells on the 15th gestation day, and were colonized into 2'-deoxyguanosine-treated allogeneic thymus lobes. The repopulated thymus lobes were organ-cultured, and the allo-specific killer activity of thymocytes recovered from the lobes was examined. These cells were tolerant to class I but not to class II-MHC of the donor haplotype, indicating that class I molecules expressed on the thymocytes worked as tolerogen. Tolerogenic ability of Thy-1+ cells was also demonstrated in another system. Upon intimate contact with allogeneic thymus lobes on a polycarbonate filter, thymus lobes fused with each other and Thy-1+ cells co-migrated (Eur. J. Immunol. 19:1525-1530, 1989). In thymus lobes rendered parabiotic from day 5, CTL tolerance was achieved against class I but not to class II MHC. These data indicate that thymocyte-thymocyte interaction is sufficient to induce class I CTL tolerance in developing thymocytes.\r"

OVA-specific T-T hybridomas were used to detect processed OVA in association with class I, H-2Kb, and class II, I-Ad/b, molecules on a B lymphoblastoid APC. OVA, internalized by APC under hypertonic conditions, was presented in association with class I and II MHC molecules. Treating the APC with NH4Cl or CH3NH2 inhibited class I- and II-restricted Ag presentation. In contrast, chloroquine markedly inhibited class II, but not class I-restricted Ag presentation. Controls indicated that drug-treated APC were fully competent to interact with T cells and present processing-independent antigenic peptides in association with both class I and II MHC molecules. NH4Cl and CH3NH2 did not inhibit the uptake of radiolabeled Ag by the APC. After the proteolytic removal of H-2Kb from the surface of APC, NH4Cl and CH3NH2-treated and control APC regenerated identical amounts of surface H-2Kb and this regeneration required de novo protein synthesis. These latter results indicate that NH4Cl and CH3NH2 can inhibit Ag presentation without affecting the synthesis, transport, or surface expression of H-2Kb. Also, NH4Cl did not affect the transport of H-2Db to the surface of mutant RMA-S cells that were cultured with exogenous peptides. Taken together these results strongly suggest that NH4Cl and CH3NH2 but not chloroquine can inhibit a critical and early intracellular step in class I-restricted Ag presentation while simultaneously inhibiting class II-restricted Ag presentation.\r"

We investigated the relationship between the class II binding affinities of four of these exotoxins, SEA, SEB, SEC1, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and their T cell signaling capabilities. Although the toxins stimulated T cells at concentrations that ranged over more than two orders of magnitude, their affinities for class II (DR1) differed by less than sixfold. The affinities of the toxins predicted their capacity to stimulate resting T cells to proliferate. The binding affinities of the toxins for class II molecules indicated that at concentrations required for T cell stimulation, as few as 0.1% of the class II molecules are complexed with toxin. Finally, the isotype of class II molecules affected the ability of the toxins to bind and use these MHC Ag to stimulate T cells. These data thus demonstrate that of the staphylococcal exotoxins studied, both their potency as T cell mitogens and their ability to function in the presence of single class II isotypes can be attributed in part to their characteristic abilities to bind class II molecules.\r"

  ".U": "91100754\r", 
  ".W": "The elicitation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in mice is mediated by the sequential activities of two different Ag-specific, Thy-1+ cells. A required early phase of elicitation is due to DTH-initiating Thy-1+ cells that are CD3- and sIg- and produce Ag-specific factors that act like IgE antibodies in that they sensitize the tissues, so that after local challenge with Ag there is release of the vasoactive amine serotonin. Released serotonin locally recruits and activates CD4+ Th-1 classical DTH effector T cells that secrete lymphokines that attract and activate a nonspecific perivascular infiltrate of circulating, bone marrow-derived leukocytes. The current study used isolated subpopulations of DTH-initiating and DTH-effector T cells to determine whether the two phases of the elicitation of DTH were entirely separate. The contact sensitivity model of DTH was used. Early-acting DTH-initiating cells, and late-acting DTH-effector T cells were either from oxazolone (OX)-immune or picryl chloride (PCl)-immune CBA or BALB/c donors and were transferred to CBA or BALB/c recipients. The results showed that DTH-initiation could be mediated by polyclonal DTH-initiating cells that were Ag mismatched or MHC incompatible with late-acting DTH effector T cells. In fact DTH-initiating cells could be both Ag mismatched and MHC incompatible with late-acting T cells. In addition, potential interactions between different cell populations were ruled out by showing that DTH-initiation could be mediated by a DTH-initiating clone that was Ag or MHC mismatched with the late-acting DTH-effector T cells. Thus, the OX-specific BALB/c clone could initiate DTH for PCl-specific CBA cells in CBA recipients if the recipients were challenged with both OX and PCl, but not when they were challenged with OX or PCl alone. We suggest, at least for the elicitation of DTH reactions in mice, that a more comprehensive description of these responses should accommodate the fact that there are early and late phase responses that each begin with Ag specificity and end with non-specific humoral factors. Inasmuch as the two Thy-1+ cells of DTH can be of different Ag specificity, this suggests that some forms of delayed and chronic inflammation, might be initiated by an immediate hypersensitivity-like immune reactivity to one set of Ag, and could be prolonged and perpetuated by delayed reactivity to another set of Ag.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently demonstrated that a single dose (200 J/m2) of UVB radiation abrogates the capacity of mouse epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) or splenic adherent cells (SAC) to present keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to Ag-specific, MHC-restricted CD4+ Th1 cells. In the present study we determined whether such Th1 unresponsiveness represented long-lasting immunologic tolerance. To address this question, Th1 were preincubated with KLH-pulsed UVB-LC or UVB-SAC, then isolated and restimulated with unirradiated APC (LC or SAC) plus KLH or with exogenous rIL-2 in the absence of APC. Preincubation with KLH and UVB-LC or UVB-SAC rendered Th1 unresponsive to subsequent restimulation with APC and KLH. In addition, such Th1 were defective in their autocrine IL-2 production, but could respond normally to exogenous rIL-2, indicating that unresponsiveness was due to functional inactivation and not to cell death. Th1 unresponsiveness was Ag-specific, MHC-restricted, and long lasting (greater than 16 days). In addition, it appears that Th1 unresponsiveness is not due to the release of soluble suppressor factors from UVB-LC or UVB-SAC because supernatants from such cells had no effect on Th1 proliferation. Addition of unirradiated allogeneic SAC during preincubation prevented the induction of unresponsiveness by UVB-LC or UVB-SAC, suggesting that UVB interferes with the capacity of LC or SAC to deliver a costimulatory signal(s) that can be provided by allogeneic SAC. We conclude that UVB can convert LC or SAC from immunogenic to tolerogenic APC.\r"

  ".W": "The role of leukocyte function-associated Ag-1 (LFA-1, CD11a/CD18) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1, CD54) interactions in human T cell and B cell collaboration was examined by studying the effect of mAb to these determinants on B cell proliferation and differentiation stimulated by culturing resting B cells with CD4+ T cells activated with immobilized mAb to the CD3 molecular complex. In this model system, mAb to either the alpha (CD11a) or beta (CD18) chain of LFA-1 or ICAM-1 (CD54) inhibited B cell responses significantly. The mAb did not directly inhibit B cell function, inasmuch as T cell-independent activation induced by formalinized Staphylococcus aureus and IL-2 was not suppressed. Moreover, DNA synthesis and IL-2 production by immobilized anti-CD3-stimulated CD4+ T cells were not suppressed by the mAb to LFA-1 or ICAM-1. Although the mAb to LFA-1 inhibited enhancement of IL-2 production by co-culture of immobilized anti-CD3-stimulated CD4+ T cells with B cells, addition of exogenous IL-2 or supernatants of mitogen-activated T cells could not abrogate the inhibitory effects of the mAb to LFA-1 or ICAM-1 on B cell responses. Inhibition was most marked when the mAb were present during the initial 24 h in culture. Immobilized anti-CD3-stimulated LFA-1-negative CD4+ T cell clones from a child with leukocyte adhesion deficiency could induce B cell responses, which were inhibited by mAb to LFA-1 or ICAM-1. These results indicate that the interactions between LFA-1 and ICAM-1 play an important role in mediating the collaboration between activated CD4+ T cells and B cells necessary for the induction of B cell proliferation and differentiation, and for enhancement of IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells. Moreover, the data are consistent with a model of T cell-B cell collaboration in which interactions between LFA-1 on resting B cells and ICAM-1 on activated CD4+ T cells play a critical role in initial T cell-dependent B cell activation.\r"

  ".U": "91100758\r", 
  ".W": "A 72/74-kDa peptide binding protein (PBP72/74) was previously described which plays a role in the processing and/or presentation of Ag, possibly by facilitating the association of processed Ag with the MHC class II molecules. PBP72/74 was recently shown to be related to the 70-kDa family of heat shock proteins (hsp70), whose members show the general characteristic of binding to denatured or inappropriately folded proteins. Here we describe the cellular and subcellular distribution of PBP72/74. By flow cytometry with PBP72/74-specific rabbit antisera, PBP72/74 is detected on the surfaces of mouse Ig+ B cells and MAC-1+ macrophages. PBP72/74 74 was not detected on the surfaces of Thy-1+ T cells or NK1.1+ NK cells. The cell surface expression of PBP72/74 does not require MHC class II expression. Indeed, the Ia- variant B cell lymphoma cell line, M12.C3, expresses PBP72/74 at levels equivalent to that of the Ia+ parent cell line, M12.4.1, from which it was derived. Furthermore, the fibroblast L cell line, DAP.3, shows no cell surface expression of PBP72/74, nor do DAP.3 lines transfected with and expressing genes encoding the alpha- and beta-chain of the I-Ad and I-Ed molecules. Moreover, treatment of B cells with either IL-4 or LPS, which increases Ia expression severalfold, does not affect PBP72/74 expression. Thus, PBP72/74 cell surface expression appears to be a property of B cells and macrophages, independent of Ia expression. In addition, the B cell surface expression of PBP72/74 is not altered by stress in the form of heat shock. Thus, PBP72/74 appears to be a constitutive noninducible member of the hsp70 family. By immunoelectron microscopy, PBP72/74 is detected in approximately 36% of early endocytic vesicles into which surface Ig is internalized after binding to anti-Ig antibodies. This compartment was previously shown to contain class II en route to the cell surface associated with invariant chain and the proteases cathepsin B and D and is suggested to be a subcellular site of antigen processing. PBP72/74 is also found associated with the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and membranes proximal to the Golgi stacks. The cellular and subcellular distribution of PBP72/74 is consistent with its playing a role in the processing of presentation of Ag with the MHC class II molecules.\r"

Based on this characterization, mAb able to recognize CD4 epitopes overlapping the HIV binding site were selected and used to immunize nonhuman primates to elicit the production of specific anti-Id antibodies. Five baboons and five rhesus monkeys were immunized with either individual or a cocktail consisting of several monoclonal anti-CD4 preparations. All the nonhuman primates produced specific anti-Id that recognized either private or cross-reactive Id depending on the monoclonal anti-CD4 used to generate the anti-Id response. Inhibition assays were performed to ascertain the ability of: 1) soluble CD4 to inhibit the Id-anti-Id reaction and 2) the various anti-Id to inhibit the CD4-monoclonal anti-CD4 reaction. These studies demonstrated that some of the anti-Id recognized a cross-reactive Id that was associated with the Ag-combining site. In addition, some of the anti-Id weakly recognized SIV gp120 by Western blot analysis. These studies may be useful in designing experiments that may lead to a better understanding of the CD4-HIV gp120 interaction and to the production of Id and/or anti-Id reagents that might be used to manipulate this virus-receptor interaction.\r"

  ".W": "We have compared the adhesion of 51Cr-labeled eosinophils and neutrophils to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cell (EC) monolayers that have been stimulated with IL-1, TNF, or LPS. Each agent stimulated the adhesion to EC of both eosinophils and neutrophils in a similar dose- and time-dependent manner. F(ab')2 fragments of mAb 1.2B6 (anti-endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM)-1) and mAb 6.5B5 (anti-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1) each inhibited partially, and to a similar extent, eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion to EC monolayers prestimulated with TNF (10 ng/ml) for 6 h. Greater inhibition of both eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion was achieved by combining the effects of mAb 1.2B6 with either mAb 6.5B5 or mAb TS1/18 (anti-CD18). These observations indicate that both ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 are involved in the adhesion of eosinophils and neutrophils to EC stimulated with TNF. In order to determine whether these molecules are expressed in vivo during allergen-induced late phase allergic responses in the skin, human skin biopsies were examined at 6 h after Ag or saline challenge with the use of an alkaline phosphatase-staining technique. Both ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 were expressed with greater intensities in Ag-challenged biopsies, suggesting that these molecules may be involved in granulocyte recruitment in vivo. The similarities we have established between mechanisms of eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion to cytokine-stimulated EC suggests that factors other than differential leukocyte-EC adhesion may be responsible for the selective accumulation of eosinophils at sites of allergic inflammation.\r"

The U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA from a 32P-labeled HeLa cell extract and five proteins with Mr 150,000, 120,000, 80,000, 36,000, and 34,000, in addition to Sm core proteins (B, B', D, E, F, and G) from an [35S] methionine-labeled extract, were immunoprecipitated by anti-MaS in isotonic solution. However, the Sm core proteins and U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA were separated from the protein-A-Sepharose facilitated MaS immunoprecipitate by incubation in a solution containing 500 mM NaCl. In immunoblots, anti-MaS antibodies reacted with one protein of Mr 150,000 from a HeLa cell nuclear extract that was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. The monospecific immunoaffinity purified antibody eluted from the immunoblot band immunoprecipitated U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA and reblotted the protein with Mr 150,000.

  ".W": "To determine if the Ag that induces an autoimmune disease influences parental MHC haplotype molecule expression in situ in MHC heterozygotes, acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced with different encephalitogenic peptides in (SJL/J x SWR)F1 mice. The mice were sensitized with either a synthetic peptide corresponding to mouse myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) residues 103-116 YKTTICGKGLSATV which induces EAE in SWR (H-2q), but not SJL/J (H-2s) mice or a synthetic peptide corresponding to PLP residues 139-151 HCLGKWLGHPDKF which is encephalitogenic in SJL/J but not SWR mice. Mice were killed when they were moribund or at 30 days after sensitization. Twelve of 18 F1 mice given PLP peptide 103-116 and 12 of 17 mice given PLP peptide 139-151 developed EAE within 2 to 3 wk after sensitization. Cryostat sections of brain samples from F1 and parental mice were immunostained with a panel of mAb identifying H-2s and H-2q class I and II MHC molecules. In brains of controls, class I MHC molecules were expressed on choroid plexus, endothelial cells, and microglia whereas class II MHC molecules were absent. In EAE lesions, class I and II MHC molecules were present on inflammatory and parenchymal cells, but the degree of parental haplotype molecule expression did not vary with the different peptide Ag tested. Thus, in (SJL/J x SWR)F1 mice, myelin PLP peptides 103-116 and 139-151 are co-dominant Ag with respect to clinical and histologic disease and parental haplotype MHC molecule expression. We propose a unifying hypothesis consistent with these results and previous observations of differential Ia expression in (responder x non-responder)F1 guinea pigs. We suggest that MHC molecules may bind locally derived peptide Ag in inflammatory sites and that these interactions influence levels of MHC haplotype molecules on APC.\r"

  ".W": "IL-6 is an important regulator of humoral and cellular immunity. Although this cytokine is produced by diverse cell types, it is not known whether it is produced by T lymphocytes under physiologic conditions or which agents can induce T cell expression of IL-6. We analyzed the production of IL-6 by human peripheral blood T cells, human thymocytes, and human T cell lines. In pure populations of these cells, stimulated with different combinations of various mitogens and cytokines, IL-6 activity could not be detected. Analysis of purified T-alpha beta and T-gamma delta cells showed that neither T cell subset produced IL-6. Similarly, IL-6 mRNA was not detected in T cell or thymocyte populations for up to 48 h after stimulation. With the use of a PCR assay, IL-6 mRNA in T cells was found to be virtually negligible, and did not change after T cell activation. By in situ hybridization it was shown that the cells expressing IL-6 mRNA after mitogen activation of PBMC do not belong to the T cell lineage. To analyze whether human T cells express IL-6 in vivo, we examined lymphoid tissues by in situ hybridization. In normal human thymus there was no detectable signal for IL-6. Tonsils showed only few positive cells within the parenchyma, but strong expression of IL-6 by epithelial cells in crypts. In contrast to normal lymph node, which contained only rare cells positive for IL-6, a lymph node from a patient with Castleman's disease showed IL-6 expression in cells occupying the marginal sinus and interfollicular areas. Screening of various human T cell lines showed that all cell lines infected with HTLV-1 secrete IL-6 activity and express IL-6 mRNA. In addition, in vitro infection of peripheral blood T cells with HTLV-1 induced de novo synthesis and secretion of IL-6. Furthermore, IL-6 expression in HTLV-1-infected cells was enhanced by stimulation with IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha. In contrast, IL-6 was not detectable in non-infected T cell lines. These studies indicate that IL-6 may not be a physiologic product of human T lymphocytes and that infection of T cells with HTLV-1 results in aberrant expression of this cytokine.\r"

We demonstrate here that only the CD2 plus CD28 combined activation induces the expression and secretion of IL-1 alpha, a cytokine classically considered as a monokine. In contrast, neither IL-1 beta nor IL-6 were produced. A second monokine, TNF-alpha was transiently expressed by T cells activated with either CD2 or CD28 mAb, but was expressed to higher levels and with a prolonged kinetics in cells activated by the CD2 plus CD28 combination. The prolonged expression of the IL-1 alpha gene could account, at least in part, for the monocyte-independent and long lasting T cell proliferation induced by the CD2 plus CD28 co-stimulation. Secretion of monokines, such as IL-1 alpha, by activated T cells, could play a regulatory role in immune responses, as well as contribute to autoimmune processes.\r"

  ".W": "A set of alloreactive IL-2-dependent human CD4+ 45RA-w29+56- Th cell clones was divided into two groups according to their ability to respond to IL-4 by proliferation and their susceptibility to inhibition by TNF-alpha. The latter cytokine blocked proliferative responses to IL-2 of IL-4-nonresponsive clones, but did not affect proliferation of IL-4-responsive clones. In the present communication, it is demonstrated that exposure of apparently non-cytotoxic Th cells to IL-4 resulted in the dose-dependent induction of allospecific CTX in clones previously shown to be capable of responding to IL-4 by proliferation. In contrast, IL-2 induced both allospecific and MHC-unrestricted \"NK-like\" CTX in both IL-4 responder and nonresponder TCC. However, coculture with IL-4 in addition to IL-2 down-regulated this induction of NK-like CTX by the IL-2 (in those clones capable of responding to IL-4). Acquisition of these two types of CTX by the same TCC was additionally modulated by TNF-alpha, which also blocked the induction of NK-like CTX but had no effect on the induction of allospecific CTX by either IL-2 or IL-4. In contrast, IFN-gamma was unable to block induction of either type of CTX in this model system. These data suggest that even at the clonal level, the relative availability of a number of different up- and down-regulatory cytokines influences the outcome of an immune response. In the present model, IL-2 up-regulates specific and NK-like CTX, the latter component of which is down-regulated by TNF-alpha or IL-4, whereas IL-4 itself can up-regulate specific but not NK-like CTX.\r"

The factors responsible for the development of CD4+ T cells which produce IL-2 but not IL-4 and cells capable of producing IL-4 but not IL-2 are unknown. Here we describe a system that allows the controlled induction of IL-2- or IL-4-producing T cells after one single round of activation. Freshly isolated CD8-depleted T cells were activated with various polyclonal T cell activators for 48 h, washed, and then expanded under different conditions. IL-2 and IL-4 production were induced by restimulation of T cells and were measured with CTLL cells that respond to both cytokines and mAb to IL-2 and IL-4. T cells produced mainly IL-2 and small amounts of IL-4 when restimulated after expansion culture for 12 days with rIL-2 alone. However, after expansion for 12 days in the presence of rIL-2 plus Con A, we observed a 30- to 100-fold up-regulation of IL-4 activity and a 100-fold down-regulation of IL-2 when assessed by responses of CTLL cells incubated with the supernatant of restimulated T cells and by responses of CTLL cells cocultured with restimulated cells. An increase of IL-4 and decrease of IL-2 was also observed when the results were based on the cell numbers at the beginning of the expansion culture. The induction of IL-4 and the down-regulation of IL-2 1) were not reproduced with alpha-methyl-mannoside-treated supernatant of Con A-stimulated spleen cells, 2) were not dependent on the presence of large numbers of APC, 3) did not result from differential consumption of lymphokines after restimulation, 4) were not due to a difference in the time course of IL-2 or IL-4 release in either T cell population, and 5) were obtained regardless of the agents used to activate or to restimulate the T cells. Because Con A remained detectable on the T cell surface and because expansion of activated T cells with IL-2 plus Con A for several days was necessary, our results indicate that mainly IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells can be induced by prolonged engagement of T cell surface molecules.\r"

  ".W": "To examine structure-activity relationships of human IL-6, we have determined the effects of specific mutations on the biologic activity of a human rIL-6 expressed in bacteria. Three types of mutants were examined: 1) a variant that contains serines in place of the four naturally occurring cysteines; 2) a series of cysteine-containing deletion mutants, each having a single internal 20 amino acid deletion; and 3) a cysteine-free variant containing a single 20 amino acid deletion. The mutants of the second type constitute a set of nonoverlapping, adjacent deletions spanning amino acids 4 through 183 of the 184 amino acids in natural human IL-6. All of the mutants were expressed, along with the full length, cysteine-containing analogue, in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins, joined to beta-galactosidase through a collagen linker. This system allows microgram quantities of the rIL-6 variants to be partially purified from small bacterial cultures without chromatographic or refolding steps. Each of the rIL-6 variants was released from the beta-galactosidase fusion protein with collagenase, and the recovered rIL-6 was quantitated by laser densitometry of Coomassie-stained, SDS polyacrylamide gels. The sp. ac. of each of the rIL-6 variants was determined using four assays: induction of IgM secretion from an EBV transformed human B cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a human hepatoma cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a rat hepatoma cell line, and induction of proliferation of a murine hybridoma cell line. Replacement of cysteines with serines reduced activity relative to cysteine-containing rIL-6 to about 20% in the rat hepatoma assay and about 3% in the mouse hybridoma assay, whereas activity in both of the human cell lines was reduced to less than 0.1%. These data suggest that the murine and rat cell lines are less selective than the human cell lines in their requirements for recognition of biologically active IL-6. Each of the deletions, except that of amino acids 4 through 23, resulted in loss of activity in all four assays. These results suggest that the information necessary for activity is not contained within any one portion of the IL-6 molecule, but rather that multiple segments of the protein are required for each of the biologic activities that we tested.\r"

A flow cytometric assay using motile sperm as a target for IgG ASA+ (n = 30) and ASA- (n = 5) sera was developed for the concomitant detection of sperm-bound IgG and the initial (C3d) and terminal (C5b-9) C components on the surface of human sperm. Of the 30 IgG ASA+ sera evaluated by flow cytometry, 15 (50%) and 22 (73.3%) sera were also positive for sperm-bound C3d and C5b-9, respectively. Monomeric IgG purified from C-fixing ASA+ serum was able to bind to sperm and induced deposition of C3 on the sperm surface in the presence of human C. Incubation of motile sperm with C-fixing immune sera resulted in a significant loss (43 to 87%) of motility associated with characteristic C5b-9-induced alterations in sperm morphology leading ultimately to sperm lysis. When motile sperm were cocultured with purified polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the presence of C-fixing immune sera, the binding of sperm heads to the PMN resulted in the formation of sperm rosettes, whereas non C-fixing or control sera had no such effect. Transmission electron microscopy of thin sections of the rosettes revealed ingestion of the sperm by the human PMN. These data suggested that 1) antibody bound to sperm is capable of activating autologous C by the classical pathway; 2) binding of both IgG and C proteins initiates C3-mediated sperm binding to PMN and sperm inactivation by deposition of membrane attack complex (MC5b-9) of C; and 3) concomitant detection of sperm-bound IgG, C3d, and C5b-9 may serve as an indicator of C-fixing cytotoxic ASA in the sera of infertile couples.\r"

Such diversity may be related to recognition of multiple peptides constitutively bound to any given MHC alloantigen. Among human alloreactive CTL, only a fraction of the clones lyse mouse P815 cells expressing class I HLA proteins. In this study the fine specificity of HLA-B27 allorecognition on human or mouse cells by five human HLA-B27-specific CTL clones was comparatively analyzed. This was done to examine what degree of variation in epitope structure is compatible with recognition of HLA Ag on mouse cells. Nine site-specific HLA-B27 mutants were expressed on both human and mouse cells, after DNA-mediated gene transfer, to construct two analogous series of target cells. The reaction patterns of four of the five CTL clones with these cell panels were compatible with conservation of their corresponding epitopes upon expression of HLA-B27 on mouse cells. The reaction pattern of the fifth clone was different with either cell panel, indicating that its epitope was structurally altered on mouse cells. It also suggested a selectively increased expression of the determinant on these cells. The results suggest that most of the epitopes recognized by allospecific CTL clones reacting across species are either independent of any bound peptide or involve identical peptides from both cell types. However, some of these clones recognize alloantigen-bound peptides that are somewhat different in structure depending on the cell type, and may be expressed at the mouse cell surface in greater amounts. Such peptides could arise from related proteins in both species, and be polymorphic as a result of phylogenetic divergence.\r"

  ".W": "The fifth C component (C5) exhibits a different stability when bound to sheep E or Escherichia coli 0111:B4, being fairly stable on the bacterial intermediate sensitized E. coli 0111:B4 coated with C components up to C5 (BAC1-5) and extremely labile on the RBC intermediate sensitized sheep E coated with C components up to C5 (EAC1-5). We examined the possibility that molecular changes of membrane-bound C5 might be responsible for the different functional behavior of the two intermediates using mAb to C5 and sensitive immunoassays to detect bound C5. The decay of EAC1-5 over 30 min of incubation at 37 degrees C was associated with a significant drop in the reactivity of bound C5 with three of four mAb used. These results contrasted with those obtained with BAC1-5, which showed unchanged reactivity with all mAb tested over the same period of incubation. The effect of mAb on the activity of C5 was then investigated in an attempt to relate the change of the reactivity pattern of EAC1-5 with the functional modification of bound C5. MAb 1.5 and 1.6 were the only antibodies that interfered with the functional activity of C5, although through a different mechanism. In particular, mAb 1.5 was active both on fluid-phase and on membrane-bound C5 and is therefore likely to interact with the binding site for the late components on C5. Conversely, mAb 1.6 was only effective on fluid-phase C5 and acted by promoting a decay of BAC1-5 similar to the spontaneous decay of EAC1-5. We suggest that the bacterial outer membrane may protect C5 from functional decay and that mAb 1.6 interferes with the stabilizing effect of the bacteria in an as yet unclear manner.\r"

  ".U": "91100779\r", 
  ".W": "p150,95 is a member of the beta 2 family of integrins, which includes both LFA-1 and Mac-1. These molecules are known to play a role in the adhesion of lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes to various cell types including vascular endothelium. p150,95 is presumed to have an adhesive function because of its structural relationship to the other beta 2 integrins and the ability of anti-p150,95 mAb to inhibit some myeloid cell interactions with tumor cells, endothelial cells, and other substrates. In an endeavor to demonstrate directly that p150,95 can act as an adhesion molecule, we raised a mAb (CBRp150/4G1) to the alpha subunit of p150,95, which allows for the purification of functional intact p150,95 heterodimers. The antibody was selected by using a high pH elution ELISA. The assay was designed to select for antibodies directed to the alpha-chain of p150,95, which could be readily dissociated from p150,95 under conditions of high pH and 2 mM MgCl2. p150,95 purified under these conditions with CBRp150/4G1-Sepharose could be immunoprecipitated by using antibodies to the alpha- and beta-chains of p150,95 indicating that the structural integrity of the heterodimer was preserved during purification and elution. Elution in the absence of divalent cations yielded primarily dissociated alpha and beta subunits. Other antibodies previously made to p150,95 alpha-chain such as SHCL3 were greatly reduced in their efficiency of yielding intact heterodimer under these conditions. Mapping of the epitopes by using chimeric molecules of p150,95/Mac-1 revealed that antibodies that react with the divalent cation sites of p150,95 are inferior for the purification of intact p150,95. The adhesive capacity of p150,95 was demonstrated by the specific binding of 18-h rIL-1 beta or LPS-stimulated endothelial cells to purified p150,95 absorbed to plastic microtiter plates. These results indicate that p150,95 can function independently as an adhesion molecule and that it can interact with a counter-receptor on stimulated endothelium.\r"

  ".U": "91100780\r", 
  ".W": "Human CR1 is composed of tandem long homologous repeating (LHR) segments that encode separate binding sites for C3b or C4b. Homologous recombination with unequal crossover has been proposed as the genetic mechanism that gave rise to the CR1 alleles that differed in their total numbers of LHR. The F allotype has four LHR, named LHR-A, -B, -C, -D, 5' to 3'. The site in LHR-A preferentially binds C4b and those in LHR-B and -C prefer C3b. A previous study revealed the presence of a fifth LHR with sequences similar to LHR-B and a third C3b binding site in the S allotype of higher m.w. In the present study, an 18-kb EcoRV fragment that was associated with the expression of the lower m.w. F' allotype hybridized with a unique pattern of cDNA and intron probes specific for LHR-C. Deletion of LHR-B and one C3b binding site was proposed as the mechanism for the appearance of this F'-specific fragment. Functional differences among the CR1 variants were sought by comparative analyses of soluble rCR1 having one, two or three C3b binding sites. Although these three variants did not exhibit any significant differences in their capacities to act as cofactors for the cleavage of monomeric C3b, their relative affinities for dimeric ligand varied more than 100-fold. Furthermore, the variant with only one C3b binding site was at least 10-fold less effective in the inhibition of the alternative pathway C3 and C5 convertases. These observations suggested that the F' allotype may be impaired in its capacity to bind opsonized immune complexes, to inhibit the formation of the alternative pathway C3 and C5 convertases, and perhaps to mediate other CR1-dependent cellular responses.\r"

  ".W": "A single immunization of Lewis rats with purified acetylcholine receptor (AChR) emulsified in adjuvant typically stimulates the production of oligoclonal AChR-reactive antibodies (as demonstrated by IEF) dominated by the IgG2a subclass, of moderate but clonotypically heterogeneous relative Ag-binding avidity, and capable of inducing symptoms of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Although similar immunization of Wistar Furth rats produces AChR-reactive antibodies with similar characteristics of clonotypic heterogeneity, avidity, and isotype expression, no detectable signs of AChR-dependent muscle impairment is observed. This contrasts the ability to induce impaired AChR function upon the passive transfer of pre-formed Lewis anti-AChR antibodies into naive Wistar Furth rats, suggesting that disease resistance in this model is not conferred at the level of the AChR itself. Moreover, if more aggressive immunization protocols are used (i.e., multiple injections of AChR), a transient breakthrough of AChR-dependent muscle dysfunction can be induced directly in the Wistar Furth strain indicating that the potential for the production of disease-causing antibodies does exist in the Wistar Furth repertoire. IEF analysis of Wistar Furth anti-AChR antibodies has revealed that hyperimmunization results in modified antibody clonotype expression that might explain changing expression of disease symptoms; however, explanations for the apparent \"resistance\" of Wistar Furth rats to disease induction are likely to be complex.\r"

  ".W": "Mac-1 is a leukocyte integrin involved in multiple adhesion phenomena and also in the phagocytosis of particles that are bound via CR1 and the IgG FcR. We examined the divalent cation requirements for the Mac-1-dependent processes of adhesion and receptor-mediated phagocytosis. With phorbol ester stimulation, both processes occurred in the absence of extracellular Ca+2. In Ca+2-containing buffer, IB4, an anti-beta 2 mAb, inhibited both adhesion and CR1-mediated ingestion. In the absence of Ca+2, IB4 no longer had any effect on ingestion, although it continued to inhibit adhesion to protein-coated plastic completely. This demonstrates that the role of Mac-1 in adhesion is distinct from its role in phagocytosis. In addition, 1) IB4 did not change intracellular Ca+2 homeostasis; 2) as little as 300 nM free extracellular Ca+2 could restore the ability of IB4 to inhibit ingestion; and 3) in the absence of extracellular Ca+2, Mac-1 was more susceptible to enzymatic cleavage. Together these data suggest a Ca+2-dependent conformational change in Mac-1, which allows distinction of the roles of Mac-1 in phagocytosis and adhesion.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that src family protein-tyrosine kinases were expressed specifically in a certain lineage or differentiation stage of hematopoietic cells. To understand the molecular basis for differentiation and function of monocyte/macrophage, we investigated the expressions of src family genes by the HL-60 cells stimulated with differentiation-inducing agents. TPA and vitamin D3 (D3) were used as stimulants for monocytic development, since each agent has been known to induce phenotypically specific differentiation of HL-60 cells. The fyn, fgr, and lyn genes were characteristically expressed concomitantly with phenotypic changes and expressions of nuclear proto-oncogenes, whereas src, lck, hck, and yes genes were not. In TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, both fyn and lyn genes, but not fgr gene, were expressed. In contrast, both fgr and lyn genes, but not fyn gene, were expressed in D3-induced differentiation of the cells. The independent and characteristic expressions of these genes were observed in the further advanced differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by TPA plus D3 or D3 plus human transforming growth factor-beta 1. The granulocytic differentiation of the cells treated with retinoic acid was accompanied by intense expression of fgr, but weak or no expression of lyn and fyn gene. These data indicate that each protein-tyrosine kinase encoded by src family genes may play distinct roles in development and/or functions of monocyte/macrophage-lineage cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-linking surface Ig on human B cells, or the TCR complex on T cells leads to the rapid appearance of newly tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. This is associated with inositol phospholipid turnover and a rise in intracellular calcium. Incubation of human B or T lymphocytes with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, herbimycin and genistein, inhibits new tyrosine phosphorylation after receptor-linked activation. This is associated with complete abrogation of the increase in intracellular calcium in these lymphocytes and inhibition of inositol phospholipid turnover. Herbimycin- and genistein-treated lymphocytes are nevertheless still capable of responding to aluminum fluoride with a rise in intracellular calcium. These data support the contention that a B cell-associated protein tyrosine kinase regulates signal transduction via phospholipase C. CD45, the membrane associated protein tyrosine phosphatase, and PMA that activates protein kinase C, both inhibit the calcium response in B lymphocytes induced by receptor cross-linking. PMA and cross-linking CD45 both induced the appearance of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in human B cells, although the pattern is quite distinct from that seen when surface lg is cross-linked. However, the induction of new tyrosine phosphorylation by anti-mu does not appear to be affected by these reagents. Although this may reflect an insensitivity of the tyrosine phosphorylation assay, it could indicate that regulation of the calcium response and regulation of the tyrosine kinase can be independent processes.\r"

  ".W": "Lactoferrin (LF) has been implicated in a number of functions including the negative regulation of myelopoiesis in vitro and in vivo, an effect mediated by suppression of cytokine release from monocytes/macrophages. This suppression is abrogated by bacterial LPS. In the present study, HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate to monocytes/macrophages by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, and LF-binding assays were performed. After differentiation, HL-60 cells showed a twofold increase of LF-binding sites with no difference in the specificity or affinity of LF between pre- and post-differentiated cells. CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c Ag, which have been associated with specific binding sites for LPS on monocytes/macrophages, were also increased three- to fourfold after differentiation. With the use of this system, the effect of LPS on LF binding was studied. At 37 degrees C, LPS enhanced LF binding on HL-60 cells, especially after differentiation. Conversely, at 4 degrees C, LPS inhibited LF binding. There was little effect of temperature on LF binding in the absence of LPS. In the presence of polymyxin B sulfate, the enhanced LF binding by LPS was abrogated. Also, pretreatment with mAbCD11 and/or mAb5D3, which are associated with or directed against candidate LPS receptors, reduced LF binding. Cross-linking studies using an iodinated, photoactivatable LPS derivative ([125I]ASD-LPS) demonstrated directly the specific binding of LPS to LF. These data indicate a dichotomous nature of LF binding on monocyte/macrophage-differentiated HL-60 cells--one being mediated by specific LF receptors whereas the other is apparently mainly via LPS receptors after formation of an LF-LPS complex. These interactions, for which a model is proposed, help to explain the mechanism behind LPS abrogation of the myelopoietic suppressive effects of LF, and a situation that probably occurs during bacterial infection.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of hyperacute rejection, a dramatic form of tissue injury caused by the reaction of antigraft antibodies with endothelial cells of an organ allograft or xenograft. We asked whether the interactions of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) with xenogeneic endothelium might be promoted by the binding of natural anti-endothelial antibodies and complement by using porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC), human serum, and human PMN in an in vitro model of hyperacute rejection. Pretreatment of PAEC with 10% human serum followed by washing markedly increased PMN adhesion from 15.7 +/- 1.8% to 62.5 +/- 3.6% (p less than 0.001). Complement and anti-endothelial antibodies were necessary for the increase, because heat-inactivated serum or serum depleted of IgM did not significantly increase PMN adhesion to treated endothelium. The induction of increased PMN adhesion to PAEC by human serum was observed within 1 min. The essential role of complement was defined using complement-depleted serum. Ten percent C2-deficient serum did not increase PMN adhesion whereas 10% C5-depleted or 10% C8-depleted serum caused the same increase in PMN adhesion as observed with normal human serum. These results suggested that C3 might play a critical role in enhanced neutrophil adhesion. In fact, PAEC treated with 10% human serum for 15 min and incubated with an F(ab')2 antihuman C3 for 10 min completely abolished the enhanced adhesion. PAEC treated with 10% human serum or C5-depleted serum displayed fluorescence of iC3b whereas monolayers treated with heat-inactivated serum or C2-deficient serum were non-reactive. The enhanced PMN adhesion to serum-treated PAEC was mediated through neutrophil receptors binding iC3b because mAb directed against CD11b/CD18 inhibited the serum-enhanced adhesion of PMN. We conclude that PMN adhesion to endothelium can be significantly enhanced by the endothelial deposition of iC3b.\r"

  ".W": "Signal transduction events have been evaluated in human neutrophils stimulated with immune complexes consisting of polyclonal rabbit antibody complexed with BSA. Immune complexes induced dose-related O2- responses, but very small increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) levels were observed, in contrast to FMLP-stimulated cells. Measurements employing [45Ca2+] demonstrated that calcium influx and efflux in cells stimulated with immune complexes was substantially less than fluxes found in FMLP-stimulated cells. With respect to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) formation under conditions in which the O2- responses to immune complexes or FMLP were similar, the Ins(1,4,5)P3 response to immune complexes was much smaller (by 65%) as compared to that induced by FMLP. Although pertussis toxin-treated cells showed a greatly diminished O2- response (by 89%) to FMLP, the response to immune complexes was largely resistant (only 26% reduction) to the inhibitory effects of this toxin. Antibodies to Fc gamma R indicated that engagement of Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII, but not Fc gamma RI, receptors was related to the O2- response of neutrophils to immune complexes. O2- formation occurred in neutrophils incubated with Staphylococcus aureus cell walls bearing antibodies to Fc gamma RII or Fc gamma RIII. These data indicate that, in human neutrophils stimulated with immune complexes, signal transduction events involve engagement of Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII. The O2- response is largely pertussis-toxin insensitive, is not associated with a significant increase in levels of [Ca2+]i, and is associated with relatively little formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3. This is in contrast to cells stimulated with FMLP in which O2- responses are largely pertussis toxin-sensitive and associated with large increases in [Ca2+]i as well as formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Signal transduction events involving Fc gamma R appear to be quite different from those events related to engagement of FMLP receptors.\r"

The quantities of these cytokines in infected spleens increase and decrease in concordance with bacterial numbers in these organs. While all of these cytokines were present in Listeria-infected spleens, only IL-6 and IFN-alpha/beta were found in the peripheral circulation. Inasmuch as TNF has been reported to be responsible for the production of IL-6 in vivo following the inoculation of a lethal dose of the Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli (Fong et al., 1989. J. Exp. Med. 170: 1627), experiments were undertaken to determine whether IL-6 production elicited by the Gram-positive bacterium, L. monocytogenes, was also TNF-dependent. It was found that the passive immunization of mice with neutralizing antibodies specific for TNF shortly before i.v. injection of a lethal or sublethal Listeria inoculum resulted in the complete neutralization of endogenously produced TNF, and in the progressive multiplication of bacteria in infected organs. It was also found that the anti-TNF IgG treatment resulted in a progressive increase in the amounts of Listeria-induced IL-6 present in spleen and blood, until the death of the host. These findings indicate that Listeria-induced IL-6 production in mice occurs primarily through a TNF-independent pathway, and correlates directly with the severity of the infection.\r"

The nucleotide sequence and genomic organization of these molecules were similar to human CD1. The sequences in the alpha 1- alpha 3 domains were almost identical to previously reported genomic clones from a different strain, indicating limited polymorphism among these molecules. The predicted amino acid sequence in the transmembrane region and in the cytoplasmic tail was identical for CD1.1 and CD1.2. The two cDNA were also homologous in the 5' untranslated region but diverged in the 3' untranslated region. In contrast to human CD1, which is expressed at high levels in thymus, the expression of CD1 message in murine thymus was not detected in either thymus leukemia Ag positive or negative strains. Cell expressing murine CD1.1 were generated after transfer of the CD1.1 cDNA into murine cell lines. Immunoprecipitation with a rat anti-mouse CD1.1 mAb showed that the transfected CD1 was expressed on the cell surface as a beta 2-microglobulin-linked heterodimer. These results demonstrate that the murine and human CD1 genes, although encoding homologous transmembrane glycoproteins, are expressed in distinct tissues and may serve different functions.\r"

  ".U": "91100798\r", 
  ".W": "Using a dimethylbenzanthracene-induced immunogenic nonmetastatic murine mammary adenocarcinoma in BALB/c mice, our previous work has shown that splenocytes from tumor bearers have reduced responses to both mitogens and Ag including tumor-associated Ag. NK and cytotoxic T cell activities are also reduced in splenocytes of tumor bearers. Mac-1+2+ macrophages induced in mammary tumor bearers are capable of down-regulating lymphocyte responses to mitogens and tumor-associated Ag by cell to cell contact interaction and increased PGE2 production. We have found that the tumor constitutively releases a granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF-like factor in vivo and in vitro, which may be responsible for the systemic increase in cells of the macrophage lineage in tumor-bearing mice. A tumor cell line established from the in vivo tumor expresses and releases GM-CSF as shown by Northern and Western blot analyses. Daily i.p. injections for 3 wk of 10,000 U of rGM-CSF into normal mice induces hemopoietic and immunologic alterations similar to those observed in tumor bearers. Mac-1+ and/or Mac-2+ macrophages can also be detected in the spleens and bone marrow of the mice treated with rGM-CSF. Additionally, splenocytes from rGM-CSF-treated mice have reduced responses to mitogens and their peritoneal exudate cells can cause in vitro down-regulation of proliferative responses of lymphocytes from normal mice. The suppression can be partially reversed by the addition of indomethacin to the cultures suggesting that PGE2 may contribute to the effect. rGM-CSF enhances the in vitro release of PGE2 by the spleen, bone marrow, and peritoneal cells of normal mice. These data indicate that the high levels of GM-CSF constitutively produced by the tumor may be responsible for the hemopoietic changes and immunologic alterations observed in tumor-bearing mice.\r"

In this study, we measured the phospholipid content and the fatty acid pattern of lesional and lesion-free epidermal keratome biopsies on 15 patients. For comparison, epidermal biopsies were obtained from healthy individuals undergoing plastic surgery. The phospholipid content of atopic epidermis was nearly twice as high as in healthy epidermis. Monounsaturated fatty acids in the phosphoglycerides were significantly increased (p less than 0.001) and n-6 fatty acids were significantly decreased (p less than 0.001) in lesional atopic epidermis compared to lesion-free epidermis. The content of esterified arachidonic acid in phosphatidylcholine from lesional epidermis was only 49% of that found in healthy epidermis (p less than 0.001). The content of free arachidonic acid was 47% higher (p less than 0.05), whereas the content of free long-chain saturated fatty acids was decreased by 29% (p less than 0.01), in lesional compared to lesion-free atopic epidermis. The disease severity, calculated as an arbitrary index, correlated inversely with the n-6 fatty acid content of lesion-free atopic epidermis (r = -0.89, p less than 0.001). Our findings suggest that atopic epidermis is characterized by an increased activity of phospholipase A2 and an incomplete transformation of phospholipids into other lipid classes.\r"

  ".W": "Normal adult human keratinocytes in monolayer culture and SCL-1, a skin-derived squamous-cell carcinoma cell line, were investigated for the expression of receptors for insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and insulin. As demonstrated by affinity crosslinking, radiolabeled IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin bound specifically to both cell types. Each cell expressed type I IGF receptors, with affinity for IGF-1 greater than IGF-2 much greater than insulin. Insulin receptors, with highest affinity for insulin, were also present on both cells. However, keratinocytes and SCL-1 cells differed in 125I-IGF-2 binding. 125I-IGF-2-bound to both type I and type II IGF receptors in normal keratinocytes, but bound predominantly to membrane-associated IGF binding proteins in SCL-1. IGF-1 was slightly more potent than IGF-2 in stimulating growth of both keratinocytes and SCL-1 cells. In keratinocytes, concentrations of IGF-1 ranging from 5-100 ng/ml, and of IGF-2 from 50-100 ng/ml, resulted in a significant increase in cell number. At the maximum dose of 100 ng/ml, either IGF-1 or IGF-2 caused a 2.3-times increase in cell number. In SCL-1 cells, IGF-1 was more potent than IGF-2 or insulin at lower concentrations, but either IGF-1 or IGF-2 at the maximal concentration of 333 ng/ml stimulated a 4.7-times increase in thymidine incorporation. The stimulatory effect of insulin in SCL-1 was 10-50 times less potent than that of the IGF. The effect of either IGF on SCL-1 was completely inhibited by the type I IGF receptor antibody alpha IR-3, suggesting that both IGFs are mitogenic through the type I IGF receptor. Insulin action was partially blocked by alpha IR-3, suggesting that insulin can act through both the insulin and type I IGF receptors. It thus appears that IGF-1 and IGF-2 are mitogens for normal and transformed human keratinocytes and that their actions are primarily mediated through the type I IGF receptor, whereas insulin is a mitogen through both the IGF-1 receptor and the insulin receptor.\r"

The dermis has a prominent role in the appearance of epidermal lesions. It is therefore of interest to study the factors that modulate dermal cell proliferation. In this study, the role of retinoids in modulating platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) bioactivity was studied in normal (six subjects) and psoriatic fibroblasts from involved and uninvolved tissues (six patients). Retinoic acid treatment (for 4 d at 10(-6) M) of psoriatic fibroblasts significantly increased the chemotactic effect of PDGF in these cells (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively, in involved and uninvolved skin at 20 ng/ml of platelet-derived growth factor as measured in a modified Boyden Chamber Assay). In the same way, retinoic acid treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts increased the mitogenicity of platelet-derived growth factor in these cells. Retinoic acid treatment has no significant effect on the mitogenic and chemotactic activity of PDGF in normal fibroblasts. The binding of the homodimer BB PDGF to its type-B receptor, which mediates the mitogenic and chemotactic effect of PDGF, was not modified by retinoic acid treatment either in psoriatic and/or normal fibroblasts. These results suggest that retinoic acid may modulate the PDGF bioactivity in psoriatic fibroblasts not by affecting the binding of this ligand to these cells but by influencing a post-receptor event.\r"

  ".W": "The phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositides is an important signal transduction pathway coupled to the cell-surface receptors for several hormones and growth factors. In addition, PLC activity can be modulated by changes in intracellular calcium and activation of GTP binding proteins. In this report, differential activation of PLC in the human keratinocyte cell line SCC-12F was studied as judged by specific patterns of inositol phosphate formation. Several hormones and growth factors previously shown to stimulate PLC in a variety of cell types were screened for activity in SCC-12F cells. Only bradykinin was active, stimulating the PLC-dependent generation of inositol (1,4,5) triphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). Ins(1,4,5)P3 was rapidly metabolized to inositol(1,4)biphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2) and inositol(1,3,4,5)tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), and subsequently degraded to inositol monophosphates. The response elicited by bradykinin was concentration dependent (EC50 value of 50 nM), suggesting involvement of a specific bradykinin receptor. Treatment of these cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 appeared to result in the direct formation of Ins(1,4)P2 without Ins(1,4,5)P3 as precursor. Treatment of the cells with AIF4-, a putative activator of GTP binding proteins, resulted in the generation of inositol monophosphates as the major metabolites in the absence of detectable Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation. Taken together, these observations suggest that the PLC complex present in SCC-12F cells can be differentially activated to yield either Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,4)P2, or InsP. The observed effects may be due to a direct PLC-dependent hydrolysis of the appropriate membrane phosphoinositide.\r"

The present study examined this relationship in various oral epithelia and epidermis. Epithelia was heat separated from specimens of porcine skin, gingiva, buccal mucosa, palate, and floor of mouth. Lipids were solvent extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography with appropriate standards. The plates were sprayed with sulfuric acid and charred, and the concentration of lipids was determined by densitometry as mg lipid/gm tissue dry weight. Permeability constants were determined for each tissue by using tritiated water in perfusion chambers. When these values were compared over all regions, total lipid did not appear to be related to the permeability of these tissues. However, in the keratinized regions (epidermis, gingiva, and palate) a lower water permeability was related to a greater content of total lipid, nonpolar lipid, ceramide, and glucosylceramide. In non-keratinized tissues, a lower permeability corresponded to increased amounts of an unidentified glycosylceramide. The role of lipid in the permeability barrier of these tissues was further demonstrated by extracting specimens of skin and oral mucosa with chloroform/methanol and then determining Kp values; in both tissue regions, there was a significant increase in water permeability. Thus, although lipid is a component of the water permeability barrier in both skin and oral mucosa, different lipid components subserve this function in keratinized and non-keratinized tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 2 (IL-2)-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have been reported to lyse tumor cells while essentially sparing normal cells in vitro. This report concerns IL-2-induced anti-keratinocyte (anti-KC) cytotoxic effectors that lyse normal human keratinocytes (KC) in vitro. Effectors were generated by culturing PBMC for 1-8 d in various concentrations of recombinant IL-2 and then assayed against 51Cr-labeled targets. Effectors stimulated with 10(3) U/ml of IL-2 for 8 d readily lysed adherent or trypsinized autologous or allogeneic KC cultured in serum-free medium. Induction of anti-KC effectors was IL-2 dose-dependent, with as little as 12-25 U/ml of IL-2 inducing increased anti-KC activity after 24 h of treatment. Although anti-KC activity was increased after overnight culture in IL-2, maximal effector potency in terms of lytic units (LU) per 10(6) effector cells required 4 d of IL-2 treatment. Maximal effector yield in terms of LU per input PBMC occurred after 8 d of IL-2 treatment. Antibody plus complement depletion studies showed that the anti-KC effectors predominantly have a CD16 --/CD3 --/CD2+ phenotype. A natural killer (NK)-like specificity of the effectors was suggested by two findings: unlabeled K562 cells totally inhibited lysis of 51Cr-KC in cold target competition assays, and interferon gamma (IFN-g) treatment (2.5 U/ml-500 U/ml of recombinant IFN-g for 48-72 h) down-regulated KC susceptibility to lysis by these effectors. Thus, IL-2 treatment of PBMC induces non-T cell, natural killer-like effectors that can lyse both autologous and allogeneic KC. Furthermore, KC resemble other cell types that become resistant to non-MHC-restricted lysis after treatment with IFN-g. Finally, the contrasting effects of IFN-g treatment on KC lysis by these effectors, as opposed to lysis by specific T cells, suggests that IFN-g could promote a shift from non-MHC-restricted to MHC-restricted KC lysis during epidermal immune responses in vivo.\r"

The affinity-purified antibodies bind not only the cytosolic 230-kD protein, showing that it is related, if not identical, to the particulate form, but also produce a discontinuous granular pattern by indirect immunofluorescence in the basement membrane zone of rabbit esophagus. In stratifying epidermal cultures, expression of the 230-kD BP antigen is limited to basal cells. These data are consistent with 230-kD BP antigen involvement in keratinocyte basal cell interaction with extracellular matrix and indicate that the cultured cell may provide a useful model for analysis of 230-kD BP antigen function.\r"

In the present communication we present data on the epitopes involved in the human autoantibody binding to an immunologically reactive murine tryptic fragment of the PF antigen (tf-PF). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that 39 PF sera, obtained from North American, Colombian, and Brazilian patients recognized only calcium-sensitive epitope(s) on the tf-PF. Immunofluorescence blocking experiments showed that preincubation with tf-PF completely blocked the immunofluorescence of 80% of the sera when tested on human skin substrate, and 86% of the sera when tested on murine skin substrate. These results show that the calcium-sensitive epitope(s) originally recognized on human PF complex, is (are) present on the murine tf-PF and constitute(s) a major antigenic region for the human PF autoantibodies. They also implicate this region of the PF antigen in the pathogenesis of PF as well as in epidermal cell adhesion.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of antigen-presenting cells (APC) to T cells via adhesion molecules is thought to deliver accessory signals that are required for efficient T-cell activation. To determine whether Langerhans cells (LC) express relevant adhesion molecules on their surfaces, we employed two-color immunofluorescence. Human epidermal cells (EC), Ficoll-enriched for LC (greater than 10%), were incubated with monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) specific for the adhesion molecules CD11a (LFA-1 alpha), CD18 (LFA-1 beta), or ICAM-1; staining was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. After 12 h of culture only HLA-DR+ cells (LC) expressed CD11a, CD18, and ICAM-1. As a test for the functional relevance of such adhesion molecule expression, we examined the capacity of the above MoAb to block LC stimulation of alloreactive T cells: EC were co-cultured with allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) for 5 d in the presence or absence of MoAb; proliferation was measured by [3H]-thymidine uptake. MoAb against CD11a, CD18, or ICAM-1 reduced the allostimulatory capacity of LC by greater than 70%; combinations of these MoAb reduced proliferation even more (90%). We conclude that interaction of adhesion molecules on LC with ligands on T cells is required for optimal allo-antigen-dependent T-cell activation, perhaps by delivering accessory signals.\r"

Specific binding was inhibited by endothelin-2 and endothelin-3 as well as endothelin-1. Non-specific binding was found in the epidermis and the medulla of hair follicles. No binding was found in connective tissue or fat. These vascular binding sites may represent endothelin receptors, in keeping with the known cutaneous vasoconstrictor actions of the peptide. If all binding sites are receptors, the results suggest that endothelin could also regulate the function of sweat glands and may have trophic effects in the skin.\r"

We found no differences in the tissue fatty acid composition between the two groups. The release of leukotriene B4 from Ca-ionophore-stimulated neutrophils in patients was on the average only 42% (p less than 0.001) of that measured in the control group, despite the very similar arachidonic acid contents of these cells. Our study does not support the assumption of an abnormal fatty acid desaturation in atopic dermatitis patients. Rather, the capacity to release and/or convert arachidonic acid into leukotrienes in neutrophils appears to be affected by this disease.\r"

The immunohistochemical studies demonstrated increased deposition of TGF-beta, type VI collagen, and fibronectin epitopes in the extracellular matrix of the fascia in comparison to the adjacent dermis in the same specimens. Increased levels of type VI collagen mRNA, as evidenced by positive in situ hybridization signals with an alpha 2(VI) collagen cDNA, were also found in the fascia in comparison with the dermis. In situ hybridizations of affected fascia with a human sequence-specific TGF-beta 1 cDNA demonstrated numerous fibroblasts displaying positive hybridization signals indicative of high levels of transcripts for this cytokine. In contrast, no hybridization signal for TGF-beta 1 was detected in fibroblasts in the adjacent dermis. These findings suggest that TGF-beta 1 may play an important role in the development of the connective tissue alterations present in EMS-associated diffuse fasciitis.\r"

Its chemotactic activity on human neutrophils, as well as its presence in psoriatic scales, may relate to a role in this disease. In the present study, the tissue distribution of the peptide was examined immunohistochemically using two monoclonal antibodies (52E8, 46E5) recently produced and characterized in our laboratory. Immunoreactivity was detected in both normal and psoriatic skin, resulting in uniform suprabasal keratinocyte staining in normal skin with 52E8 and of all keratinocytes with 46E5. Immunoreactivity in psoriasis correlated to the inflammatory tissue reaction, varying from uniform absence in highly active psoriasis to focally weak staining in plaque type psoriasis. Cells of the acrosyringium and hair follicles were always positive and were unaffected by the inflammatory activity. Epidermal immunoreactivity detected in this study may be associated with closely related peptides of the IL8 family or with truncated or extended forms of NAP-1/IL-8.\r"

T lymphocytes grew from both plaques and univolved skin biopsies and consisted of a heterogeneous population of T-cell subsets. The immunophenotypic analysis of cultured cells was comparable to the histologic examination on frozen section, i.e., there was a greater number of CD4/CDw29+ cells than CD8+/CD45+ cells. Cultures were tested in the primed lymphocyte test (PLT) and cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assays. All cultures tested demonstrated secondary proliferative but not cytolytic reactivity. The PLT results indicate that the cell cultures generated are autoreactive. This autoreactivity was found to be directed against non-human leukocyte antigens (HLA), i.e., minor HLA with some restriction to major HLA antigens.\r"

Cutaneous tissue specimens representing 12 different neoplastic and inflammatory disorders were examined. Acoustic images of unstained sections were compared with conventional light microscopic study of sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. In most neoplasms examined, it was possible to make a specific diagnosis primarily from low magnification pattern analysis. Although individual cells could be visualized, cytologic atypia was poorly defined. In the inflammatory disorders, a specific diagnosis was possible in all but bullous pemphigoid and lichen planus, because the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate was difficult to determine. The advantages of the R-SAM include the capability of producing an acoustic profile of the tissue and the future possibility of in situ diagnosis.\r"

Under these conditions, very clear and rich diffraction patterns, corresponding to the supramolecular organization of stratum corneum proteins and lipids, were obtained. The comparative study of normal or delipidized stratum corneum sheets and membrane couplets allows one to attribute certain diffraction features to lipids. Our results in the 3-7-nm range show two different distances for lipid bilayers. Concerning the protein nature of normal stratum corneum, the results show that keratin would occur in the beta form, whereas for callus it is in the alpha form. Indeed, normal stratum corneum sheets never display the 0.514-nm characteristic of alpha keratin. This result means that the supramolecular organization of keratin could depend on the keratinization process. Finally, our studies also confirm the presence of a still-unknown protein component existing in the beta form that would be located either inside the corneocytes or in some dilatated zones of the intercellular spaces.\r"

When cell homogenates were incubated with [3H]-testosterone, the 5 alpha-reductase of beard dermal papilla cells exhibited an optimum activity at pH 5.5, whereas the enzyme of dermal papilla cells from occipital scalp hair showed a broad and low plateau between pH 6.0 and 9.0, without a sharp peak. The apparent Michaelis constant of 5 alpha-reductase was 3.3 x 10(-7) M in dermal papilla cells from beard and 2.4 x 10(-5) M in those cells from occipital scalp hair. The apparent Km of 5 alpha-reductase for NADPH was 2.8 x 10(-5) M and 7.6 x 10(-4) M in beard and occipital scalp hair dermal papilla cells, respectively. There were no significant differences in the substrate specificity between these two types of cells. The 5 alpha-reductase activity was recovered mainly in the nuclear fraction of beard dermal papilla cells. By contrast, it was widely distributed among the individual subcellular fractions of dermal papilla cells from occipital scalp hair. These results strongly suggest that these two kinds of dermal papilla cells have different types of 5 alpha-reductase, and that the enzyme in beard dermal papilla cells is similar in characteristics to that in the androgen target organs such as prostate.\r"

In this study, DAF antigen has been demonstrated at the intercellular spaces of normal human epidermis with monoclonal antibody against DAF using the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method. The amount of DAF was greater at the granular layer than the basal cell layer as judged by intensity of the staining. Western blot analysis of DAF in the epidermis showed a 55-kD band, whereas that of buffy coat cells was approximately 67 kD. When DAF of the epidermis was treated with neuraminidase, the molecular weight was reduced to 53 kD, whereas that of buffy coat cells was 56 kD. These results indicated that the content of sialic acid of DAF in the epidermis was different from that of buffy coat cells. In phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC)-treated normal human skin, DAF was not demonstrated in the epidermis, whereas DAF remained unchanged on the elastic fibers. After the treatment of the epidermis by PIPLC, DAF was released into the buffer shown by Western blot analysis. These results suggested that DAF on the epidermis was anchored to keratinocyte via phosphatidylinositol (PI), whereas the anchoring mechanism of DAF on the elastic fibers was not through PI.\r"

Minoxidil sulfate is the active metabolite of minoxidil, with regard to smooth muscle vasodilation and hair growth. Formation of minoxidil sulfate is catalyzed by specific PAPS-dependent sulfotransferase(s) and minoxidil-sulfating activities have been previously reported to be present in liver and hair follicles. One of these minoxidil-sulfating enzymes has been purified from rat liver (rat minoxidil sulfotransferase, MST) and a rabbit anti-MST antibody has been prepared. Using this anti-MST antibody, we have immunohistochemically localized minoxidil sulfotransferase in the liver and anagen hair follicles from rat. In rat pelage and vibrissa follicles, this enzyme is localized within the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in the lower outer root sheath. Although the immunolocalization of MST might not necessarily correlate with the MST activity known to be present in anagen follicles, the results of this study strongly suggest that the lower outer root sheath of the hair follicle may serve as a site for the sulfation of topically applied minoxidil.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine if MSH-induced eumelanogenesis in hairbulb melanocytes of yellow (Ay/a) mice mimics the natural program of eumelanogenesis occurring in genetically black (a/a) hairbulb melanocytes. We conducted quantitative transmission electron microscopy on melanosome differentiation within MSH-treated regenerating 9-d hairbulbs of Ay/a and a/a mice. Results of exogenous alpha-MSH injections (5 d at 0.15 mM MSH) showed that the striking visual darkening of hair was accompanied by an incomplete transformation of phaeo- to eumelanogenesis. Ontogenetic data on developmental stages I-IV of 3678 melanosomes based on geometric considerations (length, width, shape, and area) showed that MSH did not induce a complete transformation from spherical phaeomelanosomes to elliptical eumelanosomes. Also, observations on the number of vesiculoglobular bodies and matrix organization reveled that MSH-treated Ay/a melanosomes retained distinct features of phaeomelanogenesis even after 5 d of MSH treatment. Thus, MSH induced a partial but incomplete pattern of eumelanogenesis in regenerating hairbulb melanocytes of Ay/a mice. The continued investigation of the dynamics of melanin synthesis in MSH-induced Ay/a mice melanocytes possessing \"mosaic\" melanosomes could be productive in understanding fundamental relationships between tyrosinase activity, matrix function, matrix structure, and regulation of melanin (phaeo- and/or eumelanin) synthesis.\r"

  ".U": "91100827\r", 
  ".W": "Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized in part by the presence of granular deposits of IgA in the papillary dermis just beneath the dermal-epidermal junction. The nature of the structures to which IgA binds in DH skin, however, has not been clearly demonstrated. Previous immunoelectron-microscopy studies using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique have concluded that the IgA may bind to abnormal elastic microfibrillar bundles. Recently, antibodies have been developed against a major component of the elastic microfibril bundles, fibrillin. In addition, another dermal matrix protein, hexabrachion, has been characterized and found in normal human skin in a distribution similar to the IgA deposits of DH. Utilizing antibodies against fibrillin, hexabrachion, and human IgA and immunoelectronmicroscopy with immunogold staining techniques, we have examined the skin from patients with DH in order to localize the IgA deposits. Normal-appearing skin from five patients with DH exhibited electron-dense patches within the dermis, which were not seen in skin from normal subjects. These structures were sometimes adjacent to the basement membrane zone, but appeared amorphous and without a well-defined fibrillar structure. The electron-dense patches were labeled with anti-human IgA, but not with antibodies to fibrillin or hexabrachion. The anti-IgA antibody did not label the normal basement membrane. These studies confirm the presence of abnormal electron-dense, amorphous structures in the skin of patients with DH. Due to this lack of association with the elastic microfibril bundles and the lack of labeling with antibodies against fibrillin, we suggest that these deposits are distinct from the microfibrillar bundles of elastic tissue and may represent IgA bound to degraded basement membrane or isolated dermal deposits of IgA.\r"

Type I and type III collagens were found in the dermal sheath and in the dermal papilla throughout the hair cycle. Laminin and type IV collagen were expressed at the outer root sheath basement membrane and in the extracellular matrix of the dermal papilla of anagen and catagen follicles. In telogen follicles, where the volume of the dermal papilla extracellular matrix is much reduced, outline staining of dermal papilla cells for laminin and type IV collagen was still apparent. Staining for bullous pemphigoid antigen was also seen at the outer root sheath basement membrane extending to the lower tip of the hair bulb. In anagen follicles, there was no staining for bullous pemphigoid antigen at the interface between hair bulb epithelium and the dermal papilla and no staining within the dermal papilla. However, linear staining for bullous pemphigoid antigen became continuous around hair follicle epithelium during catagen and telogen. Cells cultured from human dermal papillae also stained for interstitial collagens, type IV collagen and laminin. However, similar results were obtained when cultured dermal fibroblasts were stained with the same antibodies. The expression of basement membrane proteins in human dermal papillae resembles that seen in follicles from other mammalian species and suggests that this is relevant to dermal papilla function. Cultured dermal papilla cells express a similar pattern of interstitial collagens and basement membrane proteins to those seen in tissue sections but this finding is not specific to dermal papilla cells.\r"

  ".U": "91100829\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical reports have attributed the amelioration of chronic inflammatory skin disorders to the presence of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in dietary oils. To test the hypothesis of a local modulatory effect of these PUFA in the epidermis, the basal diet of normal guinea pigs was supplemented with ethyl esters of either fish oil [rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] or borage oil [rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA)]. Our data demonstrated that dietary oils influence the distribution of PUFA in epidermal phospholipids and the epidermal levels of PUFA-derived hydroxy fatty acids. Specifically, animals supplemented with ethyl esters of fish oil markedly incorporated EPA and DHA into epidermal phospholipids, which paralleled the epidermal accumulation of 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE) and 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDoHE). Similarly, animals supplemented with esters of borage oil preferentially incorporated dihomogammalinolenic acid (DGLA), the epidermal elongase product of GLA, into the epidermal phospholipids, which also was accompanied by epidermal accumulation of 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (15-HETrE). By factoring the epidermal levels of the 15-lipoxygenase products and their relative inhibitory potencies, we evolved a measure of the overall potential of dietary oils to exert local anti-inflammatory effect. For example, the leukotriene inhibition potentials (LIP) of both fish oil and borage oil were greatly enhanced when compared to controls. Thus, the altered profiles of epidermal 15-lipoxygenase products generated from particular dietary oils may be responsible, at least in part, for reported ameliorative effects of oils on chronic inflammatory skin disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Lytic H2O2-induced injury to human umbilical vein endothelial cells provides a model for endothelial cell damage in diverse states including acute respiratory distress and septic shock. Endothelial cell lysis is an extreme result of inflammatory cell activation. Functional alterations such as responsiveness to endothelial cell agonists and eicosanoid production might be impaired by exposure to inflammatory cell products including H2O2. Soluble mediators such as thrombin or histamine cause endothelial cell activation via a signal transduction mechanism that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (IP), liberating inositol trisphosphate (IP3). Accordingly, pretreatment of endothelial cells with H2O2 blocked the subsequent production of IP3 in response to thrombin and histamine. H2O2 inhibition of IP3 was time- and concentration-dependent. The endothelial cells were viable by trypan blue dye exclusion and chromium release. H2O2 inhibition of signaling was completely prevented by catalase. Iron-dependent oxidant radical formation appears critical because deferoxamine (10(-4) mol/L) pretreatment of endothelial cells prevented H2O2 inhibition of IP hydrolysis. Prostacyclin and platelet activating factor production in response to thrombin have been linked to IP hydrolysis. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with H2O2 reduced prostacyclin and platelet-activating factor production by thrombin by at least 50%. It appears H2O2 can induce defects in signaling pathways with sequelae (decreased prostacyclin and platelet-activating factor) short of endothelial cell death. The possible consequences of H2O2 interaction with endothelial cells is reviewed with the aim of presenting a hypothesis to integrate these various observations.\r"

Wistar rats showed an increase of proteinuria and GS with age, which was enhanced by unilateral nephrectomy (UN). In contrast, intact and UN Wistar Kyoto rats did not show an increase of proteinuria with age and 7 months after UN, no GS was seen in these rats. Systemic blood pressure was comparable in both strains and was not affected by UN. Functional studies in a separate group of rats 1 month after UN showed an identical increase in glomerular filtration rate in both strains as compared with sham-operated controls. The Wistar rats did not show an effect of UN on renal plasma flow, and consequently, there was an increase in filtration fraction, in contrast to Wistar Kyoto rats, which showed an increase in renal plasma flow with an unchanged filtration fraction. Glomerular volume was increased in both strains at 1 month and 7 months after UN. Mesangial expansion was not observed at 1 month after UN in either strain, which indicates that this is not a decisive factor in the development of GS. These data indicate that the genetically determined susceptibility to the development of GS in these two rat strains may be related to the degree of vasoconstriction, whereas glomerular volume expansion per se does not lead to GS but can well be a consequence of hyperfiltration. These studies are concordant with previous studies that revealed the role of hemodynamics in the pathogenesis of GS irrespective of glomerular expansion.\r"

The distribution of ACE is assymetric. The interindividual variability is large since ACE levels can differ up to 5.7 times among subjects. No association, however, was observed with candidate environmental or hormonal parameters to explain the interindividual variability in plasma ACE levels. A weak association was observed between ACE and blood pressure. A previous study, conducted in nuclear families, has shown that differences among subjects in plasma ACE levels are, in part, genetically determined. The present study does not reveal other determinants, either hormonal or environmental, of the interindividual variability in this enzyme. The characteristics of the distribution of plasma ACE levels should be considered when a value is interpreted in a given patient.\r"

In response to treatment, the serum magnesium concentration fell progressively in association with a rise in serum and urinary calcium levels and a decrease in parathyroid hormone level. In a single previous report, active vitamin D metabolites markedly improved renal magnesium wasting. However, in the present study, increases in serum and urinary calcium levels and suppression of parathyroid hormone, factors known to decrease magnesium reabsorption, presumably overwhelmed any direct effect calcitriol may have had to enhance magnesium reabsorption, so that the net effect was a marked exacerbation of the renal magnesium wasting.\r"

To determine whether this relates to intrinsic differences in the capacity, distensibility, or filling response of these segments, we used the isolated duodenum and ileum of 13 guinea pigs to record: (1) increases in the diameter and luminal volume produced by specific pressure heads and (2) the pressure waves and movements of the segments in response to bolus injections. We found that the duodenum and the ileum had similar diameters in the empty state, and when filled with volumes below 0.4 ml both generated baseline pressures below 3 cm H2O. However, the ileum increased its diameter and volume significantly more in response to increases in inflow pressure than the duodenum did. Conversely, injection of bolus volumes led to pressure waves of higher amplitude and longer duration in the duodenum than in the ileum. The pressure waves were produced by sharply defined ring contractions in the ileum; there was bulging of the walls downstream from the contraction site and collapse upstream from it. In the duodenum, the contraction involved a longer segment and was shallow with ill-defined margins. These intrinsic differences in the capacity, distensibility, and contraction patterns of the duodenum and ileum are likely to affect luminal transit and other mechanical functions of these intestinal segments in the intact animal.\r"

To determine if these interindividual differences are reproducible, we used linear regression to analyze the relationship of plasma vasopressin to plasma osmolality during repeat hypertonic saline infusion in seven normal subjects. The results confirmed that the slope or sensitivity of the relationship differed widely between subjects (0.12 to 1.66 pg/ml/mOsm/kg) and revealed that these differences were highly reproducible. (r = 0.94 on repeat testing). The individual values for osmotic threshold were less variable (280 to 288 mOsm/kg) as well as less clearly reproducible (r = 0.61). To determine whether these differences are genetically influenced, we compared the vasopressin osmolality relationships within seven monozygotic and six dizygotic twin pairs. We found that the threshold and sensitivity values correlated significantly within monozygotes (r = 0.95 and 0.95) but not within dizygotes (r = 0.34 and 0.21). When the osmoregulation of thirst was similarly evaluated, the individual relationships were as variable as for plasma vasopressin, but only the threshold values in monozygotes correlated significantly (r = 0.92). In 80 healthy adults, the frequency distributions of the osmotic threshold and sensitivity of the vasopressin responses were essentially normal. We conclude that the sensitivity for vasopressin secretion as well as the osmotic thresholds for thirst and vasopressin demonstrate significant polygenetic variance among healthy adults.\r"

Discocyte-rich, less dense fractions of sickle cells (density less than or equal to 1.11) were suspended in buffered NaCl solutions (pH 7.4) of various osmolarities, deoxygenated at room temperature for up to 5 hours, and stained by Wright's solution. Microscopic images were analyzed by circular shape factor (CSF = 4 pi x [area]/[perimeter]2) and elliptical shape factor (ESF = [short axis]/[long axis]). Since these two parameters yield different values for elongated cells and for cells of other shapes, such as maple-leaf- or star-shaped cells, the morphologic changes of sickle cells can be analyzed numerically. We found that both the rate and the degree of deformation depended highly on the osmotic pressure of the media in which the cells were suspended. In hypertonic solution, most sickle cells assumed a maple-leaf shape. The deformation occurred quickly, but the degree of deformation (circular shape factor and elliptical shape factor) was lower than that found in isotonic and slightly hypotonic solutions. Although elongated cells were formed in hypotonic and isotonic solutions, deformation was slower in these solutions than in hypertonic solutions. These results indicate that the shape and the degree of deformation of deoxygenated sickle cells are highly dependent on the osmolarity of the suspending medium and that the rate of deformation is inversely related to osmolarity. The relationship between morphology of deoxygenated sickle cells and osmotic pressure of the suspending media is discussed.\r"

Liver function was quantitated as the elimination rate of antipyrine, caffeine, and stable isotopes of cholic acid administered both orally (2,2,4,4-2H) and intravenously (24-13C). Portal-systemic shunt fraction was calculated as the ratio of the intravenous and oral clearances of the isotopes of cholic acid. Cardiac output was measured by using Doppler echocardiography. Plasma glucagon concentration was increased in patients with ascites when compared with that in patients without ascites (474 +/- 180 pg/ml vs 245 +/- 120 pg/ml, p = 0.0007) but was unrelated to urinary sodium excretion, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.48, 0.35, -0.13, 0.18, and 0.22, respectively).

Increased plasma glucagon concentration in cirrhosis is probably a result of diminished hepatic clearance. However, increased plasma concentration of glucagon does not appear to cause a hyperdynamic circulatory state or sodium retention.\r"

We have observed that IL-2 has no direct effect on coagulation factors in vitro, but it has been observed to alter the coagulant properties of vascular endothelium. Accordingly, we investigated the possibility that IL-2 infusions initiate plasma fibrinolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We studied the clinical course, platelet count, and coagulation profile in response to IL-2 infusion in seven patients, two with metastatic melanoma and five with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Every patient experienced hemodynamic instability and thrombocytopenia, and one patient suffered an unusual complication, mesenteric thrombosis. No patient had appreciable changes in the prothrombin time or the partial thromboplastin time, nor did factors V or VIII decline in the two patients observed. In four patients examined, we found decreased titers of Hageman factor (factor XII), high molecular weight kininogen, prekallikrein, and plasma thromboplastin antecedent, as if these had been consumed by reactions of the intrinsic pathway of thrombin formation. Circulating D-dimer fragments were found in the plasma of every patient at some point during each infusion cycle, and we observed decreased titers of plasminogen in the four patients just mentioned, suggesting that IL-2 infusions initiated fibrinolysis. Taken together, the clotting factor derangements and related toxicity phenomena cannot be ascribed firmly to DIC. Activation of the intrinsic (contact) system of coagulation, however, may provide one link between the vascular endothelial surface alterations caused by IL-2 infusions and the development of the systemic toxicity that resembles septic shock.\r"

The utility of HIV antigen testing in neonates and young infants has not been established. A number of sensitive techniques, such as PCR, ELISPOT, and detection of HIV-specific IgM and IgA antibodies, are under development and promise to be very useful in the early diagnosis of vertical HIV infection. However, we will be able to accurately establish the sensitivity or specificity of the individual tests only when we have results of large prospective studies. These studies should compare different diagnostic methods and correlate the results of tests performed sequentially in neonates and young infants with the natural history of their disease process and eventual clinical outcome.\r"

  ".W": "An early and accurate diagnosis of HIV infection is needed in the offspring of seropositive mothers. To this end, we have used two techniques for the direct detection of HIV in 12 newborns tested within 2 weeks after birth and 12 children. HIV isolation was carried out in lymphocyte cocultures and compared with detection of DNA and RNA sequences by molecular amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In lymphocyte cocultures, HIV was isolated in 8 of 24 cases (33%), including 3 newborns, 3 symptomatic children, and 2 asymptomatic ones. HIV DNA was detected by PCR in twice as many cases, i.e., in 16/24 cases (66%), including 7/12 newborns, 4/4 symptomatic children, and 5/8 asymptomatic ones, 2 of whom became seronegative, HIV RNA was detected in 10 of 16 cases (60%) with detectable HIV DNA, including all of the cases who had a positive HIV isolation. Only children with clinical or biological signs of HIV infection were positive for HIV RNA. Furthermore, signs of HIV infection appeared within 6 months in three of the four newborns who were positive for HIV RNA at birth. These results indicate that HIV DNA detection by PCR is far more sensitive than HIV isolation in culture for the early diagnosis of HIV infection in offspring of seropositive mothers. HIV RNA detection appears to be a useful prognostic marker since it does correlate with disease progression and may serve as a clue for HIV replication in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to describe the utilization and characteristics associated with the use of prescribed, over-the-counter, investigational, and unorthodox treatments among AIDS clinic patients. This report is derived from cross-sectional data obtained using structured telephone surveys. Study participants (n = 197) were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center AIDS clinic. One hundred eighty-nine participants (96%) received 1-24 prescription medications during the 3 months prior to interview. Those with an AIDS diagnosis received a relatively greater number of prescription drugs (p = 0.0001); an average of 5.6 prescribed medications were used by AIDS patients versus 4.8 among AIDS-related complex and 2.3 among asymptomatic patients. Thirty-one percent participated in drug trials during the 3 months before interview, including 18% who were in multiple studies. Twenty-nine percent used unorthodox treatments. Seventy-five (40%) received prescription medication from a provider other than their primary provider. A more advanced stage of illness was associated with the use of unorthodox treatments (p = 0.003): users of these treatments had a greater educational attainment than nonusers (p = 0.03) and were significantly less likely to report that their primary provider was aware of all the treatments they used (odds ratio = 2.1, p less than 0.03). We conclude that use of polypharmacy among some AIDS clinic patients is common, could create an increased risk for adverse drug reactions, and may affect clinical drug trials. Despite having decided to obtain care at a university-based clinic, many of the participants of this study also chose to receive unorthodox therapies and care from nonprimary medical providers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To define the clinical, demographic, and behavioral variables that may influence survival in patients with AIDS, we studied 526 patients with AIDS diagnosed through September 1987 who were cared for at a single medical center. A diversity of racial and ethnic backgrounds, ages, both men and women, and all risk behaviors except hemophilia were well represented. The initial AIDS defining diagnosis was the most powerful predictor of survival. The median survival was 12.8 months for patients presenting with Kaposi's sarcoma (p less than 0.001), 10.9 months for patients presenting with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (p less than 0.001), and 4.8 months for patients presenting with other infections or neoplasms (p less than 0.02). For the entire series, male sex and younger age were associated with more favorable survival (p less than 0.025). For those presenting with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, in addition to younger age (p less than 0.025), black race (p less than 0.025) and the combination of male sex and intravenous drug use (p less than 0.005) were associated with a more favorable survival. Within a setting of comparable clinical care, survival from the point of diagnosis of AIDS is associated most strongly with the initial AIDS diagnosis, but differences in age, gender, race, and risk behavior also exert an influence on survival.\r"

The rate of LTR-directed gene expression increased in response to treatment with either a phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha if either the NFAT-1 or NF kappa B binding sites were deleted, but failed to respond to these mitogenic stimuli if both sequences were absent. The HIV-1 mutant virus containing both NF kappa B and NFAT-1 deletion was able to replicate although at a much decreased growth rate, while the deletion of NFAT-1 alone increased the viral growth rate in Jurkat cells. Neither deletion of NF kappa B nor deletion of NFAT-1 decreased activation of viral replication by phorbol ester.\r"

A sensitive isoenzyme-specific radioisotopic assay system was developed for these studies. Among 22 HIV-infected patients, plasma ADA2 was significantly elevated as compared with 16 control subjects (p less than 0.01) and 6 uninfected subjects having a risk factor for HIV infection (p less than 0.01). Plasma ADA2 was not associated with the stage of disease as defined by clinical status (p greater than 0.05) or helper (CD4) lymphocyte count (p greater than 0.05). Available evidence suggests that elevated plasma ADA2 could be a useful surrogate marker for HIV infection that occurs early in the disease process.\r"

In a seroprevalence study of 458 sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attendees, 142 of 145 seropositive individuals had enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-positive saliva samples (97.9% sensitivity). All saliva samples from seronegative patients were ELISA-negative (100% specificity). Of the 142 ELISA-positive saliva specimens, 137 were also Western blot-positive (94.5% sensitivity). In a subsequent seroincidence study of 315 initially seronegative female prostitutes followed during 183 woman-years of observation, 9 of 14 women who seroconverted (7.7% seroincidence) had ELISA-positive saliva samples at the time seroconversion was detected. Only three of these saliva specimens could be confirmed by Western blot. Although salivary testing for HIV-1 antibodies using conventional assays was not sensitive in detecting recent seroconversions, screening of salivary samples for HIV-1 antibody provides a convenient alternative method for conducting seroprevalence surveys in populations in whom venipuncture is not possible or convenient.\r"

Sociodemographic and clinical data as well as information on medical and nonmedical expenditures on 36 persons with AIDS were obtained through patient interviews and review of medical bills. Persons with AIDS required a mean of 1.6 hospitalizations per year and 17 days of in-hospital care. Mean charges for the first 12 months after diagnosis of AIDS were $22,272 for inpatient medical care and $22,850 for outpatient medical care. Overall, medical costs averaged $45,122 per patient per year with almost one-third of these costs devoted to outpatient pharmaceuticals, such as AZT and aerosolized pentamidine. Mean nonmedical costs of care for volunteer services, counselling, and in-kind assistance were $9,276. These results were similar to recently published estimates of medical costs of persons with AIDS. However, our data support changing problems of care for PWAs with increased use of outpatient medical care and pharmaceuticals and decreased use of in-hospital resources.\r"

Organic dust toxic syndrome shares many clinical features with acute farmer's lung and other forms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, including the presence of increased numbers of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage. However, organic dust toxic syndrome differs from acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis in several respects: the chest X-ray does not show infiltrates, severe hypoxemia does not occur, prior sensitization to antigens in the organic dust is not required and there are no known sequelae of physiological significance, such as the recurrent attacks and the pulmonary fibrosis which may be seen with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Organic dust toxic syndrome is thought to be much more common than farmer's lung. It is important for clinical and investigational purposes that organic dust toxic syndrome be distinguished from acute farmer's lung.\r"

In vitro binding studies, analyzed using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, showed that activated charcoal had a maximal binding capacity of 0.48 mg toxin/mg charcoal and a dissociation constant of 0.078 mg charcoal/l. In vivo, orally administered, activated charcoal was assessed for treatment of acute oral or parenteral exposure to T-2 toxin in mice. Following oral toxin administration (5 mg/kg), untreated mice showed only 6% survival after 72 hr. Charcoal treatment (7 g/kg,po) either immediately or 1 hr after toxin exposure resulted in significant improvement in survival with values of 100% and 75%, respectively. Following parenteral toxin exposure (2.8 mg/kg, sc), untreated and charcoal-treated (7 g/kg, po) mice showed 50% and 90% survival, respectively, after 72 hr. LD50 value for T-2 toxin, determined at 96 hr after intoxication, increased significantly from 2 mg/kg for untreated controls to 4.5 mg/kg for activated charcoal treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A cooperative prospective study of consecutive cases of carbamazepine overdose was conducted to determine if serum levels were predictive of toxicity and if risk factors such as age, chronic exposure, or previous disorder or cardiovascular disease could be used as prognostic indicators. Seventy-three consecutive cases were collected from two regional certified poison control centers from January 1989 to August 1989. There were 25 exposures in children less than 6 yrs., 11 exposures in adolescents, and 37 exposures in adults. Ten adult cases and one adolescent case were excluded from the study due to the presence of coingestants or inadequate information. Peak measured serum levels ranged from 0.3 to 56 mcg/ml. Using the presence of coma, seizure activity or respiratory depression requiring mechanical ventilation as measures of toxicity, we found poor correlation between rising serum levels of carbamazepine and toxicity. Increased serum levels of carbamazepine did appear to correlate with increased hospital stay, but not with ICU stay. History of a seizure disorder appears to pose increased risk of a seizure in carbamazepine overdose. In this series chronic exposure to carbamazepine did not appear to increase the risk of coma or respiratory depression for a given toxic serum level and may add some protective effect. Serum levels below 40 mcg/ml do not appear to accurately predict the severity of toxicity. Cardiac conduction defects were rare (one child). Anticholinergic findings, as evidence by decreased bowel motility and sinus tachycardia were common. Previous cardiovascular disease and age did not appear to be important prognostic indicators.\r"

This study evaluates the short- and long-term results of extracorporeal renal artery reconstruction in 65 patients, including 5 children, with renovascular hypertension who were treated from 1974 through 1989. The mean age of the patients was 37 years (range, 7 to 67 years). The cause of the stenoses was arteriosclerosis in 8 patients, fibrodysplasia in 54 patients, and miscellaneous in 3. Hypertension was severe before treatment with a mean blood pressure of 187/147 mm Hg that was reduced to a mean of 159/102 mm Hg after medical therapy. Ten patients had renal dysfunction. Results were evaluated both at short-term intervals (mean, 7.9 months; 64 patients) and long-term intervals (mean, 5.9 years; 60 patients), after surgery. Blood pressure responses were classified as beneficial (cured/improved) or failures. Anatomic results were evaluated by angiography in 98% of the patients at the short-term interval and in 77% of the patients at the long-term interval. Extracorporeal renal artery surgery was performed on 78 kidneys among 65 patients (unilateral, 45 patients; bilateral, 13 patients; unilateral extracorporeal and contralateral in situ, 7 patients). In most of the cases autologous arterial graft was used for reconstruction. Early in the series one patient died as a result of the operative procedure (1/65, 1.5%). A beneficial blood pressure response occurred in 53 patients (53/65; 82%) at the short-term interval and in 49 patients (49/61; 80%) at the long-term interval, with the average blood pressure at the short-term interval being 138/85 mm Hg and at the long-term interval being 139/85 mm Hg. Renal function improved in all patients with preoperative renal dysfunction. Graft stenosis or occlusion of the main renal artery was neither observed at the short-term interval nor at the long-term interval. However, residual stenoses were observed in 9 of the 163 reconstructed distal branches (5.5%). Extracorporeal renal artery reconstruction with autologous arterial grafts can be effectively applied to lesions of the distal main renal artery and its hilar branches with durable functional results.\r"

The perioperative stroke rate was 1.5%. Patients were screened with duplex scans immediately after operation for the presence of residual carotid lesions, and followed every 3 to 6 months for either the development of a true recurrent lesion or a change in a residual one. Five hundred thirty-nine arteries (84%) had no postoperative abnormalities. The incidence of recurrent carotid lesions in this groups was 1.5%, 3.4%, and 5.2% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The incidence of symptoms in this group was 0.2%, 0.7%, and 1.4% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The earliest recurrence or symptom occurred 8 months from operation. One hundred forty-seven arteries had residual lesions that were more common when either a temporary shunt was used or the operation was carried out above the hypoglossal nerve or below the omohyoid muscle. Sixty-one patients who had plaque proximal to the arteriotomy without a significant stenosis were followed an average of 21 months. There were no changes in plaque morphology and no proven symptoms related to the residual lesion. Fifty-six patients with both plaque and significant hemodynamic abnormalities in the carotid bulb were followed an average of 18 months. Seven of these patients (12.5%) had either a significant deterioration of the lesion or a symptom from it. Each event occurred within 6 months of operation. Thirty patients had significant flow abnormalities but no visible plaque. None of these lesions deteriorated. Although common, residual carotid lesions are benign unless the lesion is characterized by both plaque within the artery and a hemodynamically significant stenosis. These lesions should be further investigated and treated when discovered.\r"

These 27 patients represent 4% of the 667 patients who underwent primary carotid endarterectomies at our institution and who are included in our carotid follow-up registry. Reoperation was prompted by recurrent symptoms in 19/29 (65.5%) cases. Comparison of long-term stroke prevention in those patients who did (84% at 5 years, 78.6% at 10 years) and did not (90.3% at 5 years, 83.6% at 10 years) develop recurrent stenosis requiring reoperation revealed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.48) when measured from the time of primary operation. The perioperative stroke and death rates for reoperation (3.4% and 0%) were acceptable. We conclude that with our acceptably low perioperative stroke morbidity (3.4%), surgery for recurrent carotid stenosis in symptomatic patients or in asymptomatic patients with high-grade (greater than or equal to 75%) stenosis maintains the durable stroke prevention offered by primary carotid endarterectomy.\r"

Mean plasma homocyst(e)ine was significantly higher in patients than in controls (14.37 +/- 6.89 nmol/ml vs 10.10 +/- 2.16, p less than 0.05). Thirty-nine percent of patients (83 of 214) had plasma homocyst(e)ine values greater than control mean + 2 standard deviations. Plasma homocyst(e)ine values were contrasted to age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, renal failure, and plasma cholesterol. No difference was found in the incidence and/or level of any of these risk factors when patients with normal plasma homocyst(e)ine were compared to those with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, both by univariate and multivariate analysis. Patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine were more likely to demonstrate clinical progression of lower extremity disease and of coronary artery disease, but not of cerebral vascular disease than were patients with normal plasma homocyst(e)ine, and the rate of progression was more rapid (p = 0.002). Progression of lower extremity disease as assessed in the vascular laboratory was also more common in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine (p = 0.01). We conclude that elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine is an independent risk factor for symptomatic lower extremity disease or cerebral vascular disease or both. Symptomatic patients with lower extremity disease and with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine also appear to have more rapid progression of disease.\r"

  ".U": "91101322\r", 
  ".W": "From 1981 to 1989, 361 consecutive in situ saphenous vein bypasses were performed. Indications for revascularization were critical limb ischemia (n = 335, 93%), popliteal aneurysm (n = 15, 4%), and claudication (n = 11, 3%). Outflow tract was the popliteal artery in 116 (32%) and tibial artery in 245 (68%) of bypasses. At 6 years primary patency was 63% and secondary patency was 81%. During the performance of the in situ bypass procedure, 86 (24%) venous conduits were modified because of a technical failure (n = 49, 13%) or an inadequate vein segment (n = 37, 10%). Secondary patency at 4 years for bypasses requiring modification was 72% compared to 84% for bypasses not modified (p less than 0.05). Atherosclerotic disease of the inflow artery necessitating endarterectomy, patch angioplasty, or replacement lowered primary patency at 3 years (69%) compared to the inflow artery not requiring reconstruction (46%, p less than 0.02). In the follow-up period, 95 (26%) bypasses were revised because of thrombosis or hemodynamic failure. Bypasses requiring revision had a 4-year secondary patency of 68% compared to 88% for bypasses not revised (p less than 0.02). The first 179 cases (1981 to 1985) were compared to the subsequent 182 cases (1986 to 1989). The secondary patency at 3 years for the latter half (92%) compared to the first half (80%) of the experience was significantly improved (p less than 0.02). The secondary patency for bypasses not requiring revision was significantly improved (p less than 0.02) for the latter half (n = 142, 97%) compared to the first half (n = 124, 83%) of the series. Long-term patency with the in situ saphenous vein bypass is dependent on surgical experience, quality of the venous conduit, and atherosclerotic disease of the inflow artery that necessitates reconstruction. Meticulous surgical technique and compulsive bypass surveillance results in superior long-term patency.\r"

  ".W": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm is conventionally treated by aneurysmorrhaphy with inlying graft. Alternatively, division of the aorta, with suture closure of the distal aorta and outflow vessels (exclusion of the aneurysm), and end-to-end proximal to distal bypass may be performed. However, the long-term fate of this operation has not been determined. Specifically, concern exists that the excluded blood filled aneurysm may not thrombose or may be the source of late sepsis. During an 8-year period we have treated 280 abdominal aortic aneurysms (urgent and elective) by exclusion of the abdominal aortic aneurysm sac and bypass via the posterolateral retroperitoneal approach. Mean age was 70 years (range, 44 to 88), with 217 men and 63 women. Preoperative CT scanning and aortography were performed to assess arterial anatomy. Seventy tube grafts and 260 bifurcation grafts were used. Thirty-day mortality rate was 4%. Estimated blood loss was 731 +/- 52 ml; mean transfusion requirements were 456 +/- 82 ml. The minor complication rate was 6%, and it is of great interest that there were no cases of ischemic colitis requiring colectomy. Aneurysm sacs thrombosed except in two anticoagulated patients who required further treatment. No late infections occurred. Five-year bypass patency rate was 98%. These data demonstrate that this method of treatment effectively minimized operative dissection and blood loss and therefore is a viable alternative for the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms.\r"

Graft occlusion measured objectively by independent coordinators and cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or stroke) were studied, expressed by life table, and analyzed statistically by log rank and confidence intervals (95% CI). Randomization achieved comparable groups with 60% of grafts inserted for rest pain or gangrene. Operative complications on aspirin plus dipyridamole included 18 reoperations for bleeding and 12 hematomas compared with 9 and 14, respectively, on placebo (NS). Most of the 172 graft failures occurred early with failure rates of 43/1000 patient-months in the first 3 months, reducing to 17/1000 at 6 to 12 months, and under 10/1000 in subsequent years. Cumulative graft patency on placebo was 72%, 62%, and 60% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively, compared with 78%, 70%, and 61% on aspirin plus dipyridamole. The difference in patency of 6.1% (95% CI, -3% to 15.5%) at 1 year and 8.0% (95% CI, -5% to 21%) at 2 years failed to achieve significance (p = 0.43). On mean follow-up of 34 months, 53 (132/1000 patient-years) cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident) occurred in patients on placebo compared with only 35 (73/1000) on aspirin plus dipyridamole, a significant difference of 59/1000 (p = 0.004). Antiplatelet therapy had little influence on femoropopliteal vein patency, but subsequent myocardial infarction and stroke was reduced in these patients with peripheral vascular disease.\r"

To prevent this problem polytetrafluoroethylene grafts externally supported with rigid rings have been developed. The present randomized, prospective study compared ringed and nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in 122 patients who underwent femoropopliteal bypass for severe limb ischemia. Patients were well matched for surgical indications and risk factors. There was no significant difference in the 3-year graft patency rate of ringed versus nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (74% vs 68%, p = 0.5). Similarly, no significant differences were found in the 3-year graft patency rates of ringed versus non-ringed above-knee (82% vs 74%, p = 0.5) or below-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (68% vs 59%, p = 0.5). The 3-year graft patency rate of all above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses was slightly greater than that of below-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (76% vs 62%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25). The 3-year limb salvage rate with ringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts was 92% compared with 79% for nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25). Data to date from this study fail to support the recommendation that ringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts be used preferentially over conventional polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in patients who require femoropopliteal bypass with a synthetic graft.\r"

One patient had significant atheroembolism, and a second had transient lower extremity paresthesias. No other complications occurred. The origin was found in 26 (55%), and 21 patients underwent thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair with this knowledge. When the critical lumbar or intercostal artery could be included as part of a long proximal or distal anastomosis, all 12 patients could be included as part of a long proximal or distal anastomosis, all 12 patients survived, and one was paralyzed. However, if the aneurysm repair mandated a midgraft anastomosis to intercostal arteries critical to spinal cord perfusion, seven of nine patients either died or were paralyzed (p less than 0.05). In the group of 19 patients operated on in whom spinal cord blood supply was not identified three patients had a technically unsuccessful operation; two died, and one was paralyzed. Twelve of 16 patients who had an adequate, but unsuccessful attempt at localization were treated by intercostal \"neglect\" and survived. Late paresis developed in two patients, but they are walking now. One of the patients who died had multiple systems failure and awakened paraplegic. She had a patent, enlarged, thoracic radicular artery at T-5 which probably supplied to spinal cord and which was missed angiographically. Paralysis was associated with aneurysm extent (group 2 and III B, dissections vs group 1 & 3, p less than 0.05). Selective intercostal angiography requires further refinement, but it is safe and offers the promise of understanding the mechanisms and risks of spinal cord complications after repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aneurysms.\r"

  ".W": "This article is concerned with the study of the effect of several variables, principally that of cerebrospinal fluid drainage, on the incidence of neurologic deficit in a prospective randomized series of patients with extensive aneurysms of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta (thoracoabdominal type I and II). Forty-six patients had cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and 52 were controls, with a total of 98 available for study. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was continuously monitored in the former group and pressure maintained less than or equal to 10 mm Hg in 20, less than or equal to 15 mm Hg in 20, and greater than 15 mm Hg in 6 patients during period of aortic clamping. The method of treatment including reattachment of intercostal and lumbar arteries (p = 0.2), temporary atriofemoral bypass during aortic occlusion (p = 0.3), and spinal fluid drainage (p = 0.8) were not statistically significant in reducing the incidence of neurologic deficits. Thus cerebrospinal fluid drainage as we used it, was not beneficial in preventing paraplegia. On appropriate statistical analysis we found that the only significant predictor of delayed deficits was postoperative hypotension (p = 0.006).\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-one arterial macroaneurysms in 23 pediatric-aged patients (16 boys and 7 girls) were treated at the University of Michigan. The average age at time of diagnosis was 10.2 years (range 6 months to 18 years). Vessels involved the aorta (4), as well as hepatic (1), splenic (2), gastroepiploic (1), renal (12), iliac (1), superficial femoral (4), popliteal (1), brachial (1), radial (2), and ulnar (2) arteries. Twelve children exhibited overt clinical manifestations including presence of a mass (7), local pain (3), hematemesis (1), and painless obstructive jaundice (1). Eleven children had asymptomatic lesions. Aneurysm existence was confirmed by arteriography or operation. All but one child underwent surgical therapy, with 20 long-term survivors (mean follow-up 3.5 years). One operative death occurred and one death occurred 6 years after surgery. This experience and a review of previously reported cases served as a basis for categorization of childhood aneurysmal disease as true aneurysms associated with (I) arterial infection, (II) giant-cell aortoarteritis, (III) autoimmune connective tissue disease, (IV) Kawasaki's disease, (V) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or Marfan's syndrome, (VI) other forms of noninflammatory medial degeneration, (VII) arterial dysplasias, (VIII) congenital-idiopathic factors, as well as (IX) false aneurysms associated with extravascular events causing vessel wall injury or disruption. Knowledge of the varied clinicopathologic characteristics of arterial aneurysms in children is important in treating these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical significance and applicability of interventions aimed at reducing reperfusion injury in postischemic skeletal muscle remain unproven, since long-term muscle salvage has not been demonstrated by most treatment protocols that attenuate early reperfusion injury. We have shown that reperfusion of ischemic skeletal muscle results in an early and prolonged sequestration of white blood cells and activation of the alternative complement cascade. The purpose of this study was to determine if 40 minutes of reperfusion with blood depleted of white blood cells and complement proteins, followed by 2 days of normal perfusion, would reduce muscle necrosis after 5 hours of ischemia. The isolated paired canine gracilis muscle model was used. The treatment muscle was initially reperfused with arterial blood that had been spun, washed, passed through a leukocyte removal filter, and resuspended in hydroxyethyl starch (greater than 99.9% removal of white blood cells and the complement proteins factor B and C4). The contralateral control muscle was subjected to unaltered reperfusion. Blood flow (ml/min/100 gm) was measured by timed collection of gracilis venous blood. Myeloperoxidase activity (absorbance at 655 nm/min/mg tissue protein) in muscle biopsies was used to monitor white blood cell sequestration. After 48 hours of reperfusion in vivo, necrosis was quantified by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Initial reperfusion with white blood cell and complement depleted blood significantly reduced muscle necrosis (53% +/- 3% vs 29% +/- 8%, p less than 0.0025, paired t test). Early blood flow was improved, (p = 0.0025, repeated measure-ANOVA), but subsequent white blood cell sequestration was not altered (p = 0.33, repeated measure-ANOVA). This suggests that a significant amount of white blood cell mediated injury occurs during the first 40 minutes of reperfusion. Preventing early complement activation and white blood cell mediated reperfusion injury is an intervention that is feasible during surgery and may result in clinically significant salvage of postischemic skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "As part of our initial evaluation to determine whether patients with lower extremity ischemia are candidates for intervention, arterial duplex examinations are performed in the noninvasive vascular laboratory. Patients with isolated short stenoses on the duplex examination are referred for transluminal angioplasty. One hundred thirty-four arteriograms were performed for ischemic peripheral vascular disease in 122 patients between July 1987 and March 1990. One hundred ten (82%) of the arteriograms were preceded by a lower extremity arterial duplex evaluation. Fifty cases (45%) were scheduled for transluminal angioplasty based on the findings of the duplex examination. Transluminal angioplasty was performed in 47 of 50 cases (94%). No significant differences in age, sex, or diabetes were found between the patients who were referred for transluminal angioplasty and those who were not. These data demonstrate that duplex scanning of the lower extremities allows the detection of lesions that will be amenable to transluminal angioplasty. We think that duplex scanning should become the standard screening tool for detection of treatable lower extremity lesions.\r"

Seventy-four men were studied with duplex ultrasonography after intracavernosal injection of 60 mg of papaverine. Fourteen men had normal erection and served as controls. Sixty men had a 1-year history of transient fading or incomplete erections. In all subjects the peak systolic velocity and end-diastolic velocity were measured, and the resistance index was calculated (peak systolic velocity--end-diastolic velocity/peak systolic velocity). Men with normal erections had peak systolic velocities greater than 35 cm/sec and end-diastolic velocities less than 4.5 cm/sec (group 1). Patients with incomplete erections (group II) could be classified into three subgroups. Twenty-three patients with end-diastolic velocities greater than 4.5 cm/sec and normal peak systolic velocities greater than 35 cm/sec were suspected to have corporal venous leakage (group A). Eighteen patients had normal end-diastolic velocities less than 4.5 cm/sec. Twelve of this group had peak systolic velocities less than 35 cm/sec, and six had peak systolic velocities ranging from 37 to 44 cm/sec. These patients were suspected of having arterial insufficiency (group B). Fifteen patients with end-diastolic velocities greater than 4.5 cm and peak systolic velocities less than 35 cm were suspected of having both venous leakage and arterial insufficiency (group C). Twenty-one patients with abnormal diastolic flow underwent infusion pharmacocavernosometry to determine the saline maintenance infusion rate necessary to maintain an intracavernosal pressure of 90 to 100 mm Hg or a full erectile response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By use of a 3 MHz duplex scanner, peak systolic velocity, peak diastolic forward velocity, end-diastolic forward velocity, and peak diastolic reverse velocity were measured in centimeters per second before and after a standardized meal. The vessels' diameters in centimeters were also measured. After the meal peak diastolic reverse velocity disappeared in all patients. The average vessel diameter in the superior mesenteric artery (0.7 cm) and celiac artery (0.8 cm) did not change. Flow velocities in the celiac artery were not significantly altered by the meal. In the control group, peak systolic velocity in the superior mesenteric artery increased 38%, peak diastolic forward velocity rose 66%, and end-diastolic forward velocity increased by 70%. In the diabetic nonneuropathic group the changes were 15%, 98%, and 100%, respectively. These changes were statistically significant (p less than 0.01). On the other hand, the patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy presenting a picture of gastroparesis did not exhibit the expected increases in postprandial velocities. Moreover, this alteration in blood flow velocity, although similar to that encountered in patients with intestinal angina, did not appear to be due to occlusive arterial disease on the basis of clinical examination and B-mode scanning.\r"

Seven probands (16.2%) had a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) known to have had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (multiplex family). To determine the prevalence of undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm, ultrasound screening of first-degree relatives over age 40 years was undertaken. Of 202 eligible relatives, 103 (51.0%) were screened. An occult abdominal aortic aneurysm was defined as an infrarenal aortic diameter greater than 3.0 cm or an infrarenal/suprarenal aortic diameter ratio of greater than 1.5. An incipient abdominal aortic aneurysm was defined as a clear focal bulge of the infrarenal aorta, which was less than 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. Four of 103 relatives (3.9%) were found to have an occult abdominal aortic aneurysm (age/sex: 57M, 60M, 62F, 65M), and three (2.9%) were found with an incipient abdominal aortic aneurysm (age/sex: 56M, 60M, 67F). These smaller abdominal aortic aneurysms were in patients younger than the operated probands (average age men, 67 years; women, 69 years). Six of seven individuals were in families previously considered simplex, increasing the actual multiplex family frequency from 16.2% to 27.9%. All seven new abdominal aortic aneurysms were found in the 49 siblings age 55 years or older. There were no abdominal aortic aneurysms found in the 39 relatives under age 55 years, in 14 children ages 50 to 59 years or in one parent. Therefore of the siblings age 55 years or older, 5/20 men (25.0%) and 2/29 women (6.9%) were found to have a previously undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of below-knee and above-knee 30 to 40 torr and 40 to 50 torr gradient stockings were studied. Despite documentation of substantial stocking compressive effects by skin pressure measurements, neither below-knee or above-knee elastic compression stockings significantly improved ambulatory venous pressure, venous refill time, maximum venous pressure with exercise, or the amplitude of venous pressure excursion in healthy patients or in patients with deep venous insufficiency (p greater than 0.05). In patients with deep venous insufficiency stockings modestly increased popliteal vein diameter and flow velocity in the upright resting position (p less than 0.02). After tiptoe exercise without stockings deep venous peak flow velocity increased in healthy patients and in patients with deep venous insufficiency by a mean of 103% in the popliteal vein and 46% in the common femoral vein (p less than 0.01). With the application of elastic compression stockings only modest augmentation of deep venous flow velocity occurred in both groups above that seen in the bare leg after exercise. Thus elastic compression stockings did not improve deep venous hemodynamic measurements in patients with deep venous insufficiency. The beneficial effects of stockings in the treatment of deep venous insufficiency must relate to effects other than changes in deep venous hemodynamics.\r"

Persons taking antihypertensive medications were excluded. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were higher in darker persons and increased by 2 mm Hg for every 1-SD increase in skin darkness. However, the association was dependent on socioeconomic status, whether measured by education or an index consisting of education, occupation, and ethnicity, being present only in person with lower levels of either indicator. Using multiple linear regression, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained significantly associated with darker skin color in the lower levels of socioeconomic status, independent of age, body mass index, and concentrations of blood glucose, serum urea nitrogen, serum uric acid, and urinary sodium and potassium. The association of skin color with blood pressure only in low socioeconomic strata may be due to the lesser ability of such groups to deal with the psychosocial stress associated with darker skin color. However, these findings also are consistent with an interaction between an environmental factor associated with low socioeconomic status and a susceptible gene that has a higher prevalence in persons with darker skin color.\r"

Ninety-six (38%) of 252 day-care providers were seropositive for cytomegalovirus by latex agglutination at entry into the study. Among 82 seronegative providers available for follow-up, seven seroconversions occurred at only two of the six participating centers, yielding an annualized seroconversion rate of 7.9%. Median time to seroconversion among these providers was 13 months. Using Kaplan-Meier estimates of risk, we determined that the overall risk of seroconversion among providers at various centers ranged from 0% to 22% by 12 months and from 0% to 40% by 16 months. Risk of cytomegalovirus acquisition by providers was independent of race, age, education, the presence of a child at home, or caring for children younger than 2 or 3 years in the day-care center. However, the risk of seroconversion among day-care providers appeared to parallel rates of cytomegalovirus excretion and acquisition among children at each center.\r"

Subjects were urodynamically categorized as those with urethral sphincteric incompetence (N = 88) and those with detrusor instability with or without concomitant sphincteric incompetence (N = 35). Bladder training reduced the number of incontinent episodes by 57%; the effect was similar for both urodynamic diagnostic groups. The quantity of fluid loss was reduced by 54%. This was greater for patients with detrusor instability than for those without it. Diurnal and nocturnal voluntary micturitions were also reduced. The effect on nocturnal micturition, however, was not observed in subjects with unstable detrusor function. It is recommended that bladder training be considered as an initial step in treatment of women with urinary incontinence. Provided prior comprehensive clinical evaluation is done, it can be prescribed without the need for urodynamic characterization.\r"

The prevalence of increased albumin excretion rates was 2.8 times higher in smokers than nonsmokers. Mean glycohemoglobin levels and duration of diabetes were also significant factors in the development of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy in a logistic regression model. Smoking remained a significant factor in the logistic regression model for albuminuria (but not retinopathy) when controlled for glycohemoglobin level, duration of diabetes, age, gender, and blood pressure. The progression of albuminuria and of retinopathy was also greater in smokers. Albuminuria improved significantly when subjects ceased smoking. It is concluded that cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor and is associated with the development and progression of early diabetic renal damage (albuminuria) and with the worsening of retinal disease in young subjects with diabetes.\r"

Driving restrictions for people with seizure disorders are intended to ensure the public's safety, but such restrictions may unduly harm the welfare of many people with seizures. In the United States, all states now permit some people with epilepsy to drive. In general, only people whose seizures are adequately controlled are licensed to drive. Adequate control has been judged principally by the seizure-free interval, but individual state standards widely vary. There is a trend toward greater liberalization of driving standards for people with seizure disorders, but the appropriateness and application of these standards continue to raise questions, as does the role physicians should have in the licensing process. Our responsibilities to persons with disabilities and advances in our understanding of seizures and the nature of driving risks warrant a reappraisal of the current medical, legal, and social implications of driving and epilepsy.\r"

Dipyridamole imaging is also useful for differentiating between ischemia and scar and identifying patients who have an increased risk for subsequent cardiac events. Dipyridamole imaging is particularly useful for preoperative risk stratification in patients undergoing surgery for peripheral vascular or aortic disease. Dipyridamole imaging is also useful for identifying residual myocardial ischemia after myocardial infarction and detecting restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Adverse side effects of dipyridamole are promptly reversed by aminophylline. Dipyridamole stress can also be employed in association with echocardiography for detection of ischemia-induced regional wall motion abnormalities.\r"

Surveys of drinking practices and problems conducted in the United States in 1967, 1969, 1979 and 1984 included numerous questions on alcohol-related problems that were identical or nearly identical in wording. Using data from these surveys, we tested for ordered increases over time in the prevalence of an indicator of multiple problems, considered on both a current (1-year) and lifetime basis. We studied prevalence in men and women between the ages of 22 and 59 in all four surveys. Prevalence of the multiple problem indicator was rare, especially when considered on a current basis. However, relative increases in prevalence ranging from 53% to over 200% were found from 1967 to 1984 in the multiple problem indicator for men and women, for lifetime as well as current problems. With the exception of current problems in women (a very rare condition even in the 1984 survey), these changes were all statistically significant or showed a trend toward significance. When respondents were subgrouped by age, all subgroups still showed increases since 1967, although sample sizes decreased and significance tests of ordered increases over time were not so consistent.\r"

It also aims to show that the contextual cues integral to such \"environment-dependent\" tolerance function to increase motivational desire to drink alcohol. Male students (N = 40), drinking on average 10-20 units of alcohol per week, were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Two groups ingested 1.2ml/kg alcohol: one (AL-EXPT) with exteroceptive contextual cues typically associated with alcohol use, and the other (AL-UNEXPT) in a context not normally associated with alcohol. A third group (placebo) believed that they were drinking alcohol but, in fact, consumed a nonalcoholic beverage in the alcohol-expected context. The fourth group drank juice in the alcohol-unexpected context. As predicted, tolerance to the deleterious effects of alcohol on cognition and motor-performance, and subjective desire to consume alcohol, were influenced by the alcohol-predictive contextual cues. A physiological index (pulse rate) also tended to confirm that these cues elicited a conditioned compensatory response to alcohol. The implications of these findings for tolerance to and motivation to drink alcohol in a nonpathological population are discussed.\r"

Measures of subjective intoxication, body sensations and breath alcohol were taken at different times during and after beverage consumption. Subjective intoxication ratings were higher for subjects who received alcohol, compared to subjects who received a placebo and reported consuming alcohol, when alcohol subjects achieved blood alcohol concentrations at and above .04%. These two groups did not differ in subjective intoxication ratings when alcohol subjects achieved blood alcohol concentrations below .04%.

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis is used to determine optimum threshold scores for the MAST and ADS and to compare the screening ability of the two instruments. Optimum cut points for the MAST and the ADS are 12/13 and 8/9, respectively. The overall accuracy of classification for both instruments using these threshold scores is 88%. The areas under the ROC curves are .91 and .90 (SD = .02) and there are no significant differences between the MAST and the ADS in their ability to screen for alcohol abuse or dependence in this population. The MAST and the ADS correlate highly with each other (.79).

Data were obtained from all treatment services in the province by surveys undertaken in 1980, 1983 and 1986. Across the period of analysis, there have been rapid increases in the number of addiction programs, their total cost and the total treatment caseload. Some specific changes have been quite consistent with ARF objectives: a stabilization in the use of hospital beds for addictions treatment, an increase in community-based versus hospital-based treatment resources, an increase in the province-wide capacity for comprehensive client assessment and a larger representation of women in addictions programs. Other ARF objectives have yet to be achieved. In particular, a major increase in nonresidential treatment alternatives and an increase in the proportion of treated cases from special populations such as youth or the elderly are still required. Suggestions are made concerning future program development.\r"

A logit modeling analysis revealed that natural father's drinking while growing up, natural mother's drinking while growing up, family structure (father present or not) and sex of the respondent were all significant predictors of current heavy drinking of adults even while controlling for all of the other variables in the model. It is concluded that early family influences may have long-term consequences on drinking behaviors.\r"

We examined the characteristics of elderly men with self-reported histories of having ever been heavy drinker (H+) in a population-based (N = 1,155, mean age = 73.7 years) longitudinal survey of community-dwelling elders; 10.4% of the men reported that they had been heavy drinkers at some time during their lives. H+ men were younger and less educated than non-heavy drinkers (H-) or never drinkers (N). Mortality was higher among H+ men who were current drinkers than among H- or N men. H+ men reported more major illnesses, poorer self-perceived health status, more physician visits, more depressive symptoms, lower levels of life satisfaction and smaller social networks than did H- or N men. Self-reported ability to perform activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living was poorest among H+ men, who also scored the lowest on a mental status examination. Thus, a history of having ever been a heavy drinker is predictive of widespread impairments in physical, psychological and social health and functioning among elderly men.\r"

In addition, traditional demographic variables continue to predict alcohol consumption levels. Students also report a similar variety of drinking related problems as in previous college drinking studies. Women constitute half as many heavy drinkers as men, but report an equal amount of alcohol-related problems in this sample. When controlling for race, it appears that white students continue to drink the most, and show heavy drinking rates comparable to a previous large college sample in the northeast. Students who live on campus drink more than their commuting counterparts, and the drinking age has little effect on consumption levels or total reported alcohol-related problems, although it alters the context of drinking somewhat. Findings are generally compared to previous as well as more recent college drinking data. Sex differences and similarities are discussed, as well as the findings concerning legal drinking status.

It was additionally to determine the possible differences between students with positive, compared to students with negative, family backgrounds of alcohol abuse in regards to drinking patterns, using a survey instrument that indirectly measures family background for alcohol abuse. For this cross-sectional study, a quota sample of 971 college students from all four regions of the United States was selected. Results revealed no association between family history and mean amount of alcohol consumed per week for the total sample (r = .007), or for men (r = .04) or women (r = .02). Curve analysis indicated a slightly positively skewed curve for the total group and also for male and female students. A t test and chi-square analysis found no significant difference between positive and negative family backgrounds and mean amount of alcohol consumed or drinking patterns. Among those with positive family backgrounds there was no clustering on a scatter plot for either heavy or light amounts of alcohol consumed. The results showed remarkable similarity in alcohol consumption and drinking patterns between students who were classified as having a positive, as opposed to negative, family background. It was concluded that having a positive family background for heavy drinking was not associated with either light or heavy alcohol consumption among this national sample of college students.\r"

  ".W": "Adolescent drinking behavior was observed on weekend nights (9 PM until midnight) in three youth bars, three youth centers and two discos located in the most southern part of the Netherlands. Drinking rates, individual characteristics, drinking group variables and aspects of the overall drinking situation were recorded. Boys and girls appeared to differ in the variables of influence on their drinking rates. Boys were observed to drink at a higher rate on evenings with loud music, when they participated in large, all-male groups and when their (estimated) age was less than 20. Together these variables explain 24% of the variance in boys' drinking rates. Girls drank less fast when they participated in a group not buying rounds and in a drinking group of constant composition. Although analysis showed that girls' drinking rates did not vary significantly with aspects of the overall situation and individual variables, still 14% of the total variance here could be explained by the drinking group variables. These results are to some extent consistent with findings from other observational studies on drinking behavior. Most of these studies showed males in large groups to drink at the highest rates. However, only a few observational studies were aimed exclusively at young people's drinking behavior and those studies did not include aspects of the overall drinking situation.\r"

A typology of drinking behavior has special relevance for this group, since the adolescent years and young adult years are formative in the development of drinking habits. This study used a model that had been applied to \"normal\" drinking behaviors of adults. However, the set of drinking variables was expanded to cover a wider range of activities, and a second set of behaviors, intended to reflect potential \"problem\" drinking, were derived from the National Council on Alcoholism criteria for the diagnosis of alcoholism. The set of 55 \"normal\" drinking behaviors was factor analyzed, yielding a six-factor structure. The first four factors were quite similar to previous work on adult drinking styles, and the remaining two factors clearly related to the drinking of younger people. The \"problem\" drinking variables yielded a two-factor structure, one set consisting of serious but uncommon experiences and the second set consisting of less serious and more common experiences. Several of the \"normal\" drinking factors were significant predictors of the \"problem\" drinking scores, suggesting that certain styles of drinking are more likely than others to lead to later problems.\r"

For male alcoholics, satisfaction with sex while drinking continues to be reported despite awareness of their partner's negative emotional reactions during sex. Clinicians and researchers are cautioned to differentiate drinking and abstinent periods when assessing the sexual relationship of alcoholic couples.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid disease is common in younger women and may be a factor in reproductive dysfunction. This probably only applies to severe cases of hyper- or hypothyroidism. Once adequately treated, neither of these disorders significantly impacts on fertility. The key is to recognize and to treat thyroid disorders in the reproductive-age woman before conception. Thyroxine therapy and even antithyroid drug therapy should be continued during pregnancy as necessary. Pregnancy is a euthyroid state that is normally maintained by complex changes in thyroid physiology. The fetal and neonatal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid system develops independently, but it may be influenced by thyroid disease in the mother. Early pregnancy is characterized by an increase in maternal T4 secretion stimulated by hCG and an increase in TBG, resulting in the elevated total serum T4 in pregnancy. The debate continues as to whether maternal T4 is important in early or late fetal brain development. If so, the physiologic changes in thyroid hormone secretion and transport in early pregnancy would help to ensure that a sufficient amount of thyroid hormone was available. There is new evidence in human subjects that substantial maternal T4 can cross the placenta during pregnancy, and this may be particularly important when fetal thyroid function is compromised as a result of congenital hypothyroidism. Maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes in pregnancy are adversely affected if severe hypothyroidism is undiagnosed or inadequately treated. Thyroid function tests should be obtained during gestation in women taking T4 and appropriate dose adjustments should be made for TSH levels outside a normal range. The TSH-receptor blocking antibodies from the mother are a recognized cause of congenital hypothyroidism in the fetus and neonate that can be permanent or transient. If neonatal hypothyroidism is detected through neonatal screening programs, and prompt and adequate T4 replacement therapy is instituted as soon as possible following delivery, subsequent growth and development are usually normal. Paradoxically, pregnancy often has a favorable effect on the course of maternal Hashimoto's disease, although there is the risk of relapse postpartum. Pathophysiologic conditions of hCG secretion such as gestational trophoblastic disease and hyperemesis gravidarum may present as thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy, but the main cause of this syndrome is Graves' disease. The mainstay of treatment is antithyroid drugs and either propylthiouracil or methimazole may be used safely. Subtotal thyroidectomy, after medical control, is the alternative treatment, but radioiodine ablation is contraindicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "As people in our society live longer, it is important for clinicians to know more about problems commonly seen in the elderly. Thyroid problems are especially important to understand because they do occur with rather high frequency, and their mode of presentation is frequently different from those seen in younger patients. The thyroid gland does undergo certain age-related changes in anatomy and physiology, but overall the thyroid is able to produce a normal amount of thyroid hormone throughout the years. Hypothyroidism is frequently difficult to diagnose in the elderly, because many of the symptoms of hypothyroidism can easily be confused with symptoms of aging. When hypothyroidism is looked for in large population studies of elderly patients, the incidence varies from 1% to as high as 17%, with women being more commonly affected than men, and subclinical hypothyroidism being more common than overt hypothyroidism. Virtually all cases of hypothyroidism are due to autoimmune thyroid disease, with most patients having measurable titers of thyroid autoantibodies. The therapy of hypothyroidism is done with extreme caution, as older patients are frequently very sensitive to the effects of excess thyroid hormone. In addition, the metabolism of thyroid hormone slows down with age, making the full replacement dose much less in an older patient than in a younger one. Hyperthyroidism is also quite common, occurring in from 0.5% to 3% of all elderly patients. The presentation is frequently atypical, as patients often lack the hyperdynamic symptomatology and instead have a more sedated, apathetic presentation. Weight loss and cardiac symptoms frequently predominate, and the presence of a goiter is frequently absent, making the diagnosis less obvious than in a younger patient. Therapy is usually radioactive iodine, after an adequate course of antithyroid drugs, to render the patient euthyroid. Thyroid nodules do occur with increasing frequency in the elderly, but most of them are not malignant. Fine-needle aspiration for cytology is very helpful in determining which patients should be referred for surgery. Well-differentiated cancers do predominate, but their course is frequently less predictable than in younger patients. Lymphoma of the thyroid and undifferentiated cancers do occur with increasing frequency in the elderly. Multinodular goiter, usually of longstanding, is frequently seen in elderly patients, and thyroid hormone suppressive therapy not only is not indicated but may contribute to exogenous hyperthyroidism.\r"

  ".U": "91101484\r", 
  ".W": "Iodine is a requisite substrate for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones, the minimum daily requirement being about 50 micrograms. An autoregulatory mechanism within the thyroid serves as the first line of defense against fluctuations in the supply of iodine and also permits escape from the inhibition of hormone synthesis that a very large quantity of iodine induces (Wolff-Chaikoff effect and escape therefrom). Environmental iodine deficiency continues to be a significant public health problem worldwide, compounded in some geographic regions by the presence of other goitrogens in some staple foods. The pathologic consequences of severe iodine deficiency include endemic goiter, endemic cretinism, increased fetal and infant mortality, and an increased prevalence in the community of cognitive and neuromotor disabilities. The implementation of an iodization program prevents endemic cretinism and reduces the frequency of the other pathologic consequences of iodine deficiency. Iodine excess results principally from the use of iodine-containing medicinal preparations or radiographic contrast media. The pathologic consequences of iodine excess will ensue only when thyroid autoregulation is defective, in that escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect cannot occur, or when autoregulation is absent. Defective autoregulation characterizes the fetal and neonatal thyroid, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, radioiodine or surgically treated Graves' hyperthyroidism, the thyroid of patients with cystic fibrosis, and the thyroid that has been exposed to weak inhibitors of the organic binding of iodine. In these circumstances, the provision of excess iodine may lead to iodide goiter with or without hypothyroidism. Absent autoregulation may be a feature of longstanding multinodular goiter, and the provision of excess iodine in this circumstance may induce thyrotoxicosis (Jod-Basedow disease). The pathologic consequences of iodine excess will resolve when the source of iodine has been dissipated. In addition to its role in reversing iodine deficiency, iodine is used as adjunctive therapy for hyperthyroidism. By inhibiting the proteolytic release of iodothyronines from thyroglobulin, it induces a prompt slowing of thyroid hormone secretion. This effect is exploited in the treatment of thyrotoxic crisis or severe thyrocardiac disease. Iodine also reduces thyroid cellularity and vascularity and therefore is used in the preparation of the patient for thyroidectomy. Finally, by exploiting the failure of escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect, iodine may also be used in the early management of radioiodine-treated Graves' hyperthyroidism.\r"

The fundamental approach is prompt and optimal treatment in the emergency department once the presenting clinical features suggest its presence. Delay in the introduction of therapy while awaiting laboratory confirmation may result in further decompensation and death. The prevention of myxedema coma entails paying special attention to certain high-risk patient groups. These groups include older women with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or previous irradiation or thyroid surgery for hyperthyroidism. Inform such patients of the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism, and perform annual thyroid function tests, such as a serum TSH, in order to provide early, adequate treatment once the test becomes positive.\r"

Endemic goiter, and associated cretinism, is totally preventable by ensuring an adequate dietary iodine intake and eliminating malnutrition and dietary goitrogens. Therapy, on the other hand, is difficult in that the goiters often do not regress and the cretinoid changes are irreversible. Nonendemic goiter due to autoimmune thyroid disease, genetic defects in thyroid hormone biosynthesis, and environmental goitrogens or neoplasia is not usually preventable. The usual therapy, involving TSH suppression by administration of L-thyroxine orally, will frequently bring about regression of early, diffuse goiters but is often ineffective in bringing about regression of large, multinodular goiters. In these patients, surgical removal of the goiter may be necessary for alleviation of obstructive symptoms. Further research is needed to elucidate the factors involved in the development of these multinodular goiters and to control the autocrine and paracrine factors involved in nodule growth.\r"

We have discussed the pathophysiologic basis for the most common pattern of alterations in routine thyroid function tests: a decreased serum T3 concentration; normal or, in critically ill patients, a low total serum T4 level; and a normal free T4 concentration. Another, less frequent pattern (high total and free T4 with a normal serum T3) can be encountered transiently in the acutely ill medical or psychiatric patient. With the recent advent of sensitive assays for TSH and better methods for serum free T4, it is now possible to define more quickly and accurately the thyroid-metabolic status of most of these sick patients; the vast majority are euthyroid. Certain drugs confound the picture. The most important of these include dopamine and high-dose glucocorticoids, both of which suppress TSH secretion from the pituitary and may actually cause a state of central hypothyroidism. Other drugs have multiple effects on thyroid hormone indices (e.g., amiodarone). Knowledge of all of the ways in which systemic illness, starvation, and certain drugs may influence thyroid function tests is crucial in assessing the thyroid status of patients with serious nonthyroid disease.\r"

These advances have provided a means to produce proteins previously available in limited supply and allow for the production of novel proteins that are improved agonists or else antagonists with greater specificity for therapeutic targets. Newer drug delivery systems should facilitate delivery of these proteins. By combining the capabilities to produce drug targets in acceptable quantities with improved methods for determining the three-dimensional structures of these targets, novel organic therapeutic molecules that act on these targets will be designed. Gene transfer therapy using genes that express important proteins or that encode \"antisense\" RNAs that inhibit the translation of specific mRNAs will soon become a reality. The use of RFLPs and PCR methodologies promises increased means to diagnose specific genetic diseases and infections. Most importantly, molecular biology is helping to understand the mechanisms of disease such that novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches can be described. These advances are providing an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cancers of the thyroid gland. They have already led to an enhanced understanding of (1) the growth factors that control proliferation of the thyroid gland, (2) the potential steps in thyroid nodule and neoplasia development, (3) particular mutations that may occur as thyroid cancers develop, (4) oncogenes that are expressed in thyroid cancers, and (5) the genetic defects that are responsible for thyroid gland malignancies in the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. With the latter, the RFLP technology has already provided an enhanced means to diagnose the disorder. With further progress, enhanced means for diagnosis and treatment should emerge. Molecular biology techniques are contributing to an increased understanding of the mechanisms of development of autoimmune thyroid disease as with Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The potential role of infections, histocompatibility antigens, thyroid gland and extraglandular antigens, immune modulators, subpopulations of T-cells such as suppressor and helper cells, other cells involved in immune responses, and a combination of influences of several different functions on the thyroid gland are being defined. This knowledge should soon suggest improved means for diagnosis and treatment. Understanding of the function of the thyroid hormone receptors should have clinical importance. This knowledge suggests a means to develop thyroid hormone antagonists that may be used to more rapidly ameliorate the effects of hyperthyroidism and could be useful in nonthyroidal disorders such as cardiac arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Individually, they range from the rare case of acute bacterial thyroiditis to the other end of the spectrum, the even rarer Riedel's thyroiditis. Relatively common thyroid inflammatory diseases include the subacute thyroiditis syndromes. Of particular interest to endocrinologists is that both subacute granulomatous (painful) thyroiditis and subacute lymphocytic (painless) thyroiditis are very similar in terms of clinical course, although most likely have different etiologies. Nevertheless, their similarities suggest the possibility that there may be etiologic heterogeneity for the syndromes. From a clinical standpoint, it is essential to differentiate subacute painless thyroiditis from Graves' disease, because these two disorders also may mimic each other, yet only Graves' disease requires specific therapy. Chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis, the commonest of the thyroiditides, presents with goiter and either hyperthyroidism (uncommon), hypothyroidism (common), or euthyroidism (most common). When L-T4 therapy is used in the treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the physician must be alert to the possibility of excess thyroid hormone administration. Sensitive TSH measurements help to avoid this therapeutic pitfall.\r"

There is no universal agreement on the mechanism of Graves' disease, but the over-activity of the thyroid is due to an antibody capable of attaching to and activating the TSH receptor of follicular cells. There are other extrathyroidal features that are not caused either by this antibody or by hyperthyroidism. The clinical diagnosis is generally straightforward and can be confirmed by in vitro measurement of thyroid hormones and TSH. A measurement of radioiodine uptake is also valuable. Treatment is not specific for the immunologic defect, but its purpose is to lower the thyroid hormone levels to normal. This can be achieved with antithyroid medication, radioiodine iodine-131, or thyroidectomy. In most clinical situations, a strong argument can be made for iodine-131 therapy, which is safe and definitive, although posttreatment hypothyroidism and the need for lifelong thyroxine are to be expected.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Physicians have long believed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is low in patients with congestive heart failure, but this concept is based on a misinterpretation of the results in a single report published in 1936. To reevaluate this concept in the modern era, we measured the sedimentation rate in 242 patients who were referred for treatment of chronic heart failure. RESULTS. The sedimentation rate was low (less than 5 mm per hour) in only 24 patients (10 percent) but was increased (above 25 mm per hour) in 50 percent. Patients with low or normal sedimentation rates (less than or equal to 25 mm per hour) had more severe hemodynamic abnormalities than patients with elevated rates: lower cardiac index (mean +/- SEM, 1.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.1 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area) and higher mean right atrial pressure (mean +/- SEM, 12 +/- 1 vs. 9 +/- 1 mm Hg) (both P less than 0.0001). New York Heart Association functional class IV symptoms were present in 66 percent of the patients with a low or normal sedimentation rate, as compared with 42 percent of those with elevated rates (P less than 0.0001). After one to three months of therapy, patients whose sedimentation rates decreased showed little hemodynamic or clinical response to treatment, whereas both cardiac performance and functional status improved in patients whose rates increased (P less than 0.02 for the comparison between groups). The sedimentation rate was correlated with the plasma fibrinogen level (r = 0.64, P = 0.0025), and changes in the sedimentation rate during treatment were correlated inversely with changes in mean right atrial pressure (r = -0.57, P = 0.0002). During long-term follow-up, patients with low or normal sedimentation rates had a worse one-year survival than patients with elevated rates (41 vs. 66 percent, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is correlated with the severity of illness in patients with chronic heart failure. Because of its lack of discriminatory power, however, the test is of limited value in the clinical management of this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Exposure to airborne spores of the common mold Alternaria alternata has been implicated in asthma attacks. Such exposure is particularly frequent in the Midwest during the summer and fall months. To determine the role of A. alternata in triggering severe asthma attacks, we investigated the cases of 11 patients with asthma who had sudden respiratory arrest and determined the frequency of sensitivity to this allergen in these patients. METHODS. The 11 patients (age range, 11 to 25 years) with initial episodes of respiratory arrest, which was fatal in 2 patients, were identified in the course of their care in our pediatric and adult clinical allergy practice and by a retrospective review of all Mayo Clinic records of patients with severe asthma cared for between 1980 and 1989. Skin-test reactivity to A. alternata and levels of IgE antibody against this mold in the 11 patients were compared with those in 99 matched controls with asthma who had no history of respiratory arrest. RESULTS. All the patients came from the upper Midwest, and the episodes of respiratory arrest occurred in the summer or early fall. Ten of the 11 patients with asthma who had respiratory arrest (91 percent) had positive skin-puncture tests for sensitivity to alternaria, as compared with 31 percent of the controls (P less than 0.001), and the serum levels of IgE antibodies to alternaria were elevated in all 9 patients tested. Among the covariates we examined (age, sex, and distance from the Mayo Clinic), only age was a significant confounder. After adjustment for age, alternaria skin-test reactivity was found to be associated with an increase of approximately 200-fold in the risk of respiratory arrest (adjusted odds ratio, 189.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 6.5 to 5535.8). CONCLUSIONS. Exposure to the aeroallergen A. alternata is a risk factor for respiratory arrest in children and young adults with asthma.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The exercise capacity of patients with muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency is low and fluctuates from day to day. The basis of this variable exercise tolerance is unknown, but our patients with this disorder report that fatigue of active muscles is more rapid after a high-carbohydrate meal. METHODS AND RESULTS. To determine the effect of carbohydrate on exercise performance, we asked four patients with muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency to perform cycle exercise under conditions of differing availability of substrate--i.e., after an overnight fast, and during an infusion of glucose or triglyceride (with 10 U of heparin per kilogram of body weight) after an overnight fast. As compared with fasting and the infusion of triglyceride with heparin, the glucose infusion lowered plasma levels of free fatty acids and ketones, reduced maximal work capacity by 60 to 70 percent, and lowered maximal oxygen consumption by 30 to 40 percent. Glucose also increased the relative intensity of submaximal exercise, as indicated by a higher heart rate at a given workload during exercise. The maximal cardiac output (i.e., oxygen delivery) was not affected by varying substrate availability, but the maximal systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference was significantly lower during glucose infusion (mean +/- SE, 5.5 +/- 0.3 ml per deciliter) than after fasting (7.6 +/- 0.4 ml per deciliter, P less than 0.05) or during the infusion of triglyceride with heparin (8.9 +/- 1.3 ml per deciliter, P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. In muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency, the oxidative capacity of muscle and the capacity for aerobic exercise vary according to the availability of blood-borne fuels. We believe that glucose infusion lowers exercise tolerance by inhibiting lipolysis and thus depriving muscle of oxidative substrate (plasma free fatty acids and ketones); this impairs the capacity of working muscle to extract oxygen and lowers maximal oxygen consumption.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. As part of an interdisciplinary study of medical injury and malpractice litigation, we estimated the incidence of adverse events, defined as injuries caused by medical management, and of the subgroup of such injuries that resulted from negligent or substandard care. METHODS. We reviewed 30,121 randomly selected records from 51 randomly selected acute care, nonpsychiatric hospitals in New York State in 1984. We then developed population estimates of injuries and computed rates according to the age and sex of the patients as well as the specialties of the physicians. RESULTS. Adverse events occurred in 3.7 percent of the hospitalizations (95 percent confidence interval, 3.2 to 4.2), and 27.6 percent of the adverse events were due to negligence (95 percent confidence interval, 22.5 to 32.6). Although 70.5 percent of the adverse events gave rise to disability lasting less than six months, 2.6 percent caused permanently disabling injuries and 13.6 percent led to death. The percentage of adverse events attributable to negligence increased in the categories of more severe injuries (Wald test chi 2 = 21.04, P less than 0.0001). Using weighted totals, we estimated that among the 2,671,863 patients discharged from New York hospitals in 1984 there were 98,609 adverse events and 27,179 adverse events involving negligence. Rates of adverse events rose with age (P less than 0.0001). The percentage of adverse events due to negligence was markedly higher among the elderly (P less than 0.01). There were significant differences in rates of adverse events among categories of clinical specialties (P less than 0.0001), but no differences in the percentage due to negligence. CONCLUSIONS. There is a substantial amount of injury to patients from medical management, and many injuries are the result of substandard care.\r"

We report here an analysis of these adverse events and their relation to error, negligence, and disability. METHODS. Two physician-reviewers independently identified the adverse events and evaluated them with respect to negligence, errors in management, and extent of disability. One of the authors classified each event according to type of injury. We tested the significance of differences in rates of negligence and disability among categories with at least 30 adverse events. RESULTS. Drug complications were the most common type of adverse event (19 percent), followed by wound infections (14 percent) and technical complications (13 percent). Nearly half the adverse events (48 percent) were associated with an operation. Adverse events during surgery were less likely to be caused by negligence (17 percent) than nonsurgical ones (37 percent). The proportion of adverse events due to negligence was highest for diagnostic mishaps (75 percent), noninvasive therapeutic mishaps (\"errors of omission\") (77 percent), and events occurring in the emergency room (70 percent). Errors in management were identified for 58 percent of the adverse events, among which nearly half were attributed to negligence. CONCLUSIONS. Although the prevention of many adverse events must await improvements in medical knowledge, the high proportion that are due to management errors suggests that many others are potentially preventable now. Reducing the incidence of these events will require identifying their causes and developing methods to prevent error or reduce its effects.\r"

An important feature of these models is that variations in certain directions in colour space modulate the response of only one of the channels. We have tested whether such models can predict how colour appearance is altered by adaptation-induced changes in post-receptoral sensitivity. In contrast to the changes predicted by three independent channels, colour appearance is always distorted away from the direction in colour space to which the observer has adapted. This suggests that at the level at which the adaptation effects occur, there is no colour direction that invariably isolates only a single post-receptoral channel.\r"

Although multiple t-associated loci have a role in expression of this phenotype, only one--the t complex responder (Tcr) locus--is responsible for determining which of the two homologues of chromosome 17 will be transmitted at a high ratio. A candidate gene (Tcp-10b) for Tcr that is expressed in both meiotic and post-meiotic male germ cells has been cloned. But for this candidate gene to function as the haploid effector of TRD, the t-allele of this gene (Tcp-10bt) must express a unique product in a haploid-specific manner. Here we show that a change in the splicing pattern of Tcp-10bt transcripts occurs during sperm differentiation. This change results in a unique allele-specific and haploid-specific transcript which could encode a variant polypeptide that would fulfil the conditions required of the Tcr effector of TRD.\r"

A burst in kinase activation and protein phosphorylation may also be important in triggering the dramatic reorganization of the cell during the transition from interphase to mitosis. The interphase-metaphase transition of microtubule arrays is under the control of p34cdc2 kinase, a central control element in the G2-M transition of the cell cycle. Here we show that a Xenopus kinase, closely related to the mitogen-activated mammalian MAP kinase, is phosphorylated and activated during M phase of meiotic and mitotic cell cycles, and that the interphase-metaphase transition of microtubule arrays can be induced by the addition of purified Xenopus M phase-activated MAP kinase or mammalian mitogen-activated MAP kinase to interphase extracts in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Follicular lymphoma, the most common human lymphoma, characteristically has a t(14; 18) interchromosomal translocation. It is typically an indolent disease comprised of small resting B cells, but frequently develops into a high-grade lymphoma. The t(14; 18) translocates the Bcl-2 gene, generating a deregulated Bcl-2-immunoglobulin fusion gene. Bcl-2 is a novel inner mitochondrial membrane protein that extends the survival of certain cells by blocking programmed cell death. To determine the oncogenic potential of the t(14; 18) translocation, we produced transgenic mice bearing a Bcl-2-immunoglobulin minigene that structurally mimicked the t(14; 18). An indolent follicular hyperplasia in these transgenic mice progressed to a malignant diffuse large-cell lymphoma. The long latency, progression from polyclonal to monoclonal disease, and histological conversion, are all suggestive of secondary changes. Half of the immunoblastic high-grade lymphomas had a rearranged c-myc gene. Our transgenic mice provide an animal model for tumour progression in t(14; 18) lymphoma and show that prolonged B-cell life increases tumour incidence.\r"

Analysis of the effects of mutations in GATA-binding sites in cell culture and in binding assays in vitro, as well as transactivation studies with GATA-1 expression vectors in heterologous cells, have provided indirect evidence that this factor is involved in the activation of globin and other genes during erythroid cell maturation. GATA-1 is also expressed in megakaryocytes and mast cells, but not in other blood cell lineages or in non-haemopoietic cells. To investigate the role of this factor in haematopoiesis in vivo, we disrupted the X-linked GATA-1 gene by homologous recombination in a male (XY) murine embryonic stem cell line and tested the GATA-1-deficient cells for their ability to contribute to different tissues in chimaeric mice. The mutant embryonic stem cells contributed to all non-haemopoietic tissues tested and to a white blood cell fraction, but failed to give rise to mature red blood cells. This demonstrates that GATA-1 is required for the normal differentiation of erythroid cells, and that other GATA-binding proteins cannot compensate for its absence.\r"

Numerous electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, including rapid freeze-quench studies, have failed to detect changes in the copper oxidation state in the presence of substrate amines. One suggestion that copper reduction might occur, has never been confirmed. Copper amine oxidases contain another cofactor, recently identified as 6-hydroxydopa quinone (topa quinone), which is reduced by substrates. Copper has been implicated in the reoxidation of the substrate-reduced enzyme, but the failure to detect any copper redox change has led to proposals that Cu(II) acts as a Lewis acid, that it has an indirect role in catalysis, or that it serves a structural role. We present evidence for the generation of a Cu(I)-semiquinone state by substrate reduction of several amine oxidases under anaerobic conditions, and suggest that the Cu(I)-semiquinone may be the catalytic intermediate that reacts directly with oxygen.\r"

It is suspected that the increase in cyclic GMP concentration that occurs after activation of climbing fibres is required to evoke long-term depression. Excitatory amino acids are known to cause the release of nitric oxide (NO), resulting in elevation of the cGMP level in the cerebellum. Here we report that endogenous NO is released after stimulation of climbing fibres, that long-term depression evoked by conjunctive stimulation of parallel and climbing fibres is blocked by haemoglobin (which strongly binds NO) or L-NG-monomethyl-arginine (an inhibitor of NO synthase), and that exogenous NO or cGMP can substitute for the stimulation of climbing fibres to cause long-term depression in rat cerebellar slices. These results demonstrate that the release of endogenous NO is essential for the induction of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum.\r"

Rejection of parental and allogeneic marrow cells also differs from conventional T cell-mediated rejection mechanisms as it is effected by NK1.1+ cells. To account for the unusual specificity of bone marrow rejection, it has been proposed that NK1.1+ cells destroy marrow cells that fail to express the full complement of self MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules. We show here that NK1.1+ cells in normal mice reject haemopoietic transplants from mice that are deficient for normal cell-surface MHC-I expression because of a targeted mutation in the beta 2-microglobulin gene. These findings demonstrate that deficient expression of MHC-I molecules renders marrow cells susceptible to rejection.\r"

  ".W": "During formation of the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine receptors in the endplate membrane become metabolically stabilized under neural control, their half-life increasing from about 1 day to about 10 days. The metabolic stability of the receptors is regulated by the electrical activity induced in the muscle by innervation. We report here that metabolic stabilization of endplate receptors but not of extrajunctional receptors can be induced in the absence of muscle activity if muscles are treated with the calcium ionophore A23187. Acetylcholine receptor stabilization was also induced by culturing non-stimulated muscle in elevated K+ with the Ca2+ channel activator (+)-SDZ202-791. Conversely, activity-dependent receptor stabilization is prevented in muscle stimulated in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blockers (+)-PN200-110 or D-600. Treatment of muscles with ryanodine, which induces Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the absence of activity, does not cause stabilization of junctional receptors. Evidently, muscle activity induces metabolic acetylcholine receptor stabilization by way of an influx of Ca2+ ions through dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels in the endplate membrane, whereas Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is ineffective in this developmental process.\r"

  ".U": "91101725\r", 
  ".W": "Development of colon carcinomas can be associated with allelic deletions on several chromosomes, including 5q and 18q. The APC gene on 5q and the DCC gene on 18q have been identified as potential tumour suppressor genes, whose suppression contributes to colon carcinogenesis. To investigate the role of genes in these deleted regions, we have now introduced a single normal human chromosome into a human colon carcinoma cell line, COKFu, through microcell hybridization. Several clones of hybrid cells containing normal chromosome 5, and others containing normal chromosome 18, were obtained. The morphology of the hybrid cells was markedly altered: the hybrids with chromosome 5 exhibited a closely packed polygonal morphology, and the hybrid cells with chromosome 18 were flattened. The cloning efficiency of the hybrid cells in soft agar was reduced from 0.46 to 0% of that of the parental carcinoma cells, and the tumorigenicity of these hybrid cells in athymic nude mice was completely suppressed. The growth properties of the hybrid cells with chromosome 11 were not substantially changed. These results strongly suggest that the genes on normal chromosome 5 and 18 function as tumour suppressors in colon carcinogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "91101727\r", 
  ".W": "In the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite germ line, sperm and then oocytes are made from a common pool of germ-cell precursors. The decision to differentiate as a sperm or an oocyte is regulated by the sex-determining gene, fem-3. Expression of fem-3 in the hermaphrodite germ line directs spermatogenesis and must be negatively regulated to allow the switch to oogenesis. In adult hermaphrodites (which are producing oocytes), most fem-3 RNA is found in the germ line, consistent with both the requirement for fem-3 in hermaphrodite spermatogenesis and the maternal effects of fem-3 on embryonic sex determination. Whereas loss-of-function mutants in fem-3 produce only oocytes, hermaphrodites carrying any of nine fem-3 gain-of-function (gf) mutations make none; instead sperm are produced continuously and in vast excess over wild-type amounts. Genetic analyses suggest that fem-3(gf) mutations have escaped a negative control required for the switch to oogenesis. Here we report that all nine fem-3(gf) mutants carry sequence alterations in the fem-3 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). There is no increase in the steady-state level of fem-3(gf) RNA over wild-type, but there is an increase in the polyadenylation of fem-3(gf) RNA that is coincident with the unregulated fem-3 activity. Results of a titration experiment support the hypothesis that a regulatory factor may bind the fem-3 3' UTR. We speculate that fem-3 RNA is regulated through its 3' UTR by binding a factor that inhibits translation, and discuss the idea that this control may be part of a more general regulation of maternal RNAs.\r"

  ".U": "91101728\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of protein synthesis is required for quiescent cells to transit the cell cycle, and seems to be mediated in part by phosphorylation of the 40S ribosomal protein, S6. A mitogen-activated S6 kinase of relative molecular mass 70,000 (70K) has been isolated from mouse fibroblasts as well as from avian, rat and rabbit tissues. Comparison of complementary DNA sequences shows that this enzyme is distinct from S6 kinase II (92K) found in Xenopus eggs and fibroblasts. Both kinases are activated by serine/threonine phosphorylation, suggesting that at least one serine/threonine kinase links receptor tyrosine kinases with S6 kinases. A candidate for this link is MAP2 kinase, which is rapidly activated by tyrosine/threonine phosphorylation following mitogenic stimulation. Incubation of MAP2 kinase from insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with phosphatase-inactivated S6 kinase II from Xenopus leads to partial reactivation and phosphorylation of the enzyme. These and other findings have led to the suggestion that MAP2 kinase also activates the 70K S6 kinase. Here we refute this idea by showing that the two kinases lie on distinct signalling pathways.\r"

Between 1974 and 1988 the number of extractions performed annually by two high-referral hospital-based surgeons rose by 68%. Over 90% of these procedures in 1974 were intracapsular extractions; in 1988, 90% were extracapsular extractions with intraocular lenses. In 1988, preoperative visual acuity was better in both the study eyes and the fellow eyes, the proportion of those with acuities better than 20/60 having risen from 10% to 21%, and from 49% to 67%, respectively. The proportion of patients waiting more than 2 years for surgery on the second eye doubled between 1974 and 1988. These changes, already evident by 1982 for the hospital-based surgeons, became characteristic of the community-based surgeons' practices as well between 1982 and 1988.\r"

Eighty-six percent achieved 6/12 or better visual acuity. Postoperative IOP and visual acuity results were similar to those achieved by trabeculectomy or ECCE/PC-IOL, respectively. Cumulative years of preoperative glaucoma therapy had an adverse effect on postoperative IOP control.\r"

The eyes were divided into two groups: group I comprised 75 eyes (69%) that had undergone conventional surgical procedures for congenital glaucoma prior to cyclocryotherapy; group II, 34 eyes (31%) that had not undergone any such previous procedures. All eyes were followed for at least 12 months after the last cyclocryotherapy. With \"success\" defined as \"having an IOP greater than or equal to 8 mmHg, greater than or equal to 19 mmHg with or without medication,\" the success rate in all eyes was 30%, with no significant difference between the success rates in groups I and II (P greater than .05). Chronic hypotony (IOP less than 8 mmHg) was found in seven eyes (6%). Six eyes (6%) developed cataract during the course of treatment with cyclocryotherapy. Cyclocryotherapy appears to be a reasonable addition to the treatment of eyes with advanced, uncontrolled, primary congenital glaucoma.\r"

Self-elimination of at-risk donors several years prior to testing donor blood helped to reduce the number of infected donations. Virtually all contaminated donors are now eliminated. The multiply transfused patient developed a stimulated dysregulated immune system due to the numerous antigens and the iron in red cells and plasma. This dysregulated immune system has resulted in a variable response to the added exposure of the HIV virus. The incubation period and progression to disease have been prolonged and variable. Although a small number of patients have progressed as rapidly as other at-risk groups, many continue to do well without therapeutic intervention. Natural history of the disease needs continual monitoring to determine the ultimate outcome of these transfusion recipients.\r"

Zidovudine administered at 180 mg/m2/dose every 6 hours is the current standard therapy for symptomatic children and those with low CD4 counts. This standard is likely to evolve as further testing clarifies the optimal dosage for ZDV in different populations. Children on ZDV need to be monitored very closely (at least monthly) for hematologic side effects, which are most common in the more seriously ill children. The role of some of the newer antiretrovirals, like ddI and ddC, which are likely to be licensed, has yet to be established. They have a different toxicity profile than ZDV and thus may work well in combination with it. The issue of peripheral neuropathy and the lack of an easy test to measure it makes using ddC or ddI in young, preverbal children a daunting proposition. As with ZDV, the optimum dosage and timing have yet to be fixed for ddC or ddI alone, and even less available are regimens for combination therapy. Antiretroviral drugs other than the dideoxynucleosides are less well developed. Some, like high-titer antiviral immunoglobulin, involve technology that is already available and thus will be relatively easy to study. Others, like the antisense oligomers, are such a new technology that there are many hurdles to be overcome as the agents move from the laboratory to the clinic. The goal of agents that work on sites other than reverse transcriptase is a reasonable one, but the work in perfecting such new categories of drug is difficult and slow. In the meantime, children with HIV should be symptomatically supported and offered the most effective antiretroviral regimens available.\r"

However, because the mother and often the father and siblings share this lethal viral infection, the impact of HIV disease upon the family surpasses that of virtually all other chronic conditions. This is compounded by the association of the disease with drug use, its preponderance among the most disenfranchised populations in the United States, and the persistent public fear and discrimination surrounding AIDS. We have made substantial progress already in the medical management of this infection, and while we await the development of more effective therapies, we already have the tools and knowledge in hand to help these families.\r"

Children in various forms of child-care arrangements (home care, group care, and day care) were enrolled at birth and observed for 3 years. Families were telephoned every 2 weeks to record on a standardized form the type and severity of illnesses experienced during the previous interval. Only children remaining in their original child-care group for the entire study period were compared. The mean duration of an upper respiratory tract infection varied between 6.6 days (for 1- to 2-year-old children in home care) and 8.9 days (for children younger than 1 year in day care). The percentage of apparently simple upper respiratory tract infections that lasted more than 15 days ranged from 6.5% (for 1- to 3-year-old children in home care) to 13.1% (for 2- to 3-year-old children in day care). Children in day care were more likely than children in home care to have protracted respiratory symptoms. Of 2741 respiratory tract infections recorded for the 3-year period, 801 (29.2%) were complicated by otitis media. During the first 2 years of life, children in any type of day care were more likely than children in home care to have otitis media as a complication of upper respiratory tract infection. In year 3, the risk of otitis media was similar in all types of child care.\r"

Return visits within 2 weeks for the same complaint occurred in 10 cases. The majority of the patients were discharged home (n = 18), and all of them had appropriate, adequately documented discharge instructions.

The mean age of patients was 26 months and the median duration of symptoms was 1 day. Trauma was reported in 43 (51%) cases and fever in 14 (17%). Results of radiographical studies appeared normal in 81 children (96%), demonstrated soft tissue swelling in 2 children, and revealed a bony island in 1 child. In 1 patient admitted to the hospital for failure to thrive and irritability, and whose radiographic results appeared normal, findings consistent with osteomyelitis later developed. Of the remaining children, 68 (81%) were available for follow-up observation 4 to 28 months after the initial visit and all reported spontaneous resolution of the initial complaint. It was concluded that in a well-appearing child with an otherwise normal physical examination results, an acute gait disturbance is likely to be a self-limiting condition and radiographs are unlikely to contribute to the diagnosis.\r"

The strength of association (odds ratio) of coital status with other risk behaviors and feelings was examined in 1504 junior high school students. Among the 12 through 16-year-old students, 63% of the boys and 36% of the girls were nonvirginal (had had intercourse at least once). The proportion of sexually experienced boys and girls increased with age. Nonvirginal boys and girls were significantly (P less than .001) more likely than their virginal cohorts to engage in other activities considered risky. The odds ratios for nonvirginal youth ranged from 3.5 for girls having used drugs other than alcohol or marijuana, to 10.4 for girls having used marijuana. Nonvirginal boys and girls were also at significantly greater risk for engaging in minor delinquent acts and having school problems. Nonvirginal girls (but not boys) were 6.3 times more likely to report having attempted suicide. The strength of associations with feelings was weaker. Nonvirginal girls were at slightly greater risk for reporting feeling lonely, feeling upset, and having difficulty sleeping. A significant proportion of the students reported sexual experience and ever use of alcohol or marijuana (45% of boys, 27% of girls). There were strong age effects so that by age 15 years, 63% of the boys and 50% of the girls reported experience with both activities. The data suggest that early sexual experience among adolescents is associated with other potentially health-endangering behaviors and that the syndrome of problem behaviors is important in this age group.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether plasma aluminum levels were elevated in infants with normal renal function during prolonged aluminum-containing antacid use. Ten study infants (mean age = 5.8 months), who had been receiving antacids for at least 1 week, were compared with 16 control infants (mean age = 9.8 months) not receiving antacids. The study patients consumed 123 +/- 16 mg/kg per day (mean +/- SEM) of elemental aluminum for an average of 4.7 weeks. Their plasma aluminum level (37.2 +/- 7.13 micrograms/L) was significantly greater than that of the control group (4.13 +/- 0.66 micrograms/L) (P less than .005). It is concluded that plasma aluminum levels may become elevated in infants with normal renal function who are consuming high doses of aluminum-containing antacids. The safety of antacids containing aluminum should not be assumed and they should be used judiciously in infants, with careful monitoring of the aluminum dose and plasma level.\r"

Susceptible well children were eligible for vaccination if the child with malignancy had leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumor in remission for 3 months or longer. No evidence of vaccine virus transmission was found among 30 children with malignancy whose 37 healthy susceptible siblings were immunized with varicella vaccine. Varicella-zoster virus was not isolated from the oropharyngeal secretions taken from 17 vaccinees or their 14 immunocompromised siblings. None of the 30 immunocompromised children had vaccine-related rashes or showed immunologic evidence of subclinical varicella-zoster virus infection based on testing for varicella-zoster virus IgG antibodies and T-lymphocyte proliferation to varicella-zoster virus. Four healthy vaccinees eventually had mild breakthrough cases of varicella, with transmission to the high-risk sibling in 3 cases. However, even in these families, the immunocompromised children had been protected from household exposure varicella for at least 20 months early in the course of their immunosuppressive treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-five families were enlisted in a study exploring factors associated with distress behavior in 5-year-old children receiving diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunizations. At a home visit 1 month before the immunization, the following measures were obtained: (1) the Behavioral Style Questionnaire, a measure of temperament: (2) parental self-reports of medically related attributes (eg. \"good patient\"); (3) parental attitudes toward pain in children and responsiveness to their child's pain; and (4) parental prediction of distress at upcoming immunization. The child's distress behavior during the immunization was evaluated using a modification of the Procedure Rating Scale-Revised and, after the procedure, the child's assessment of his or her pain was elicited using the Oucher. Children's mean Procedure Rating Scale-Revised score was 2.57 of a possible 11. Thirty-one (48%) had low (less than or equal to 1) and 7 (11%) had high distress scores (greater than or equal to 2 SD above the mean). Factors positively correlated with distressed behavior included more \"difficult child\" cluster characteristics, the individual temperamental dimension of adaptability, but few parental attitudes and attributes. Parent's predictions of distress were the strongest correlates. These findings document the variation that children demonstrate in response to pain and offer some insight into associated innate and environmental factors. These results imply that treatment strategies derived from parental knowledge and tailored to individual characteristics of the child may be most effective in alleviating pain-related distress in medical settings.\r"

Unfortunately, many cases of amblyopia are not diagnosed until the child is too old to benefit maximally from treatment. A review of patient records from the practice of a private pediatric ophthalmologist confirmed that late detection is a frequent occurrence among children with amblyopia who have had good access to health care. A case-control study was then used to identify factors associated with delayed diagnosis, in which children with an adverse outcome (diagnosed at or after 5 years of age) were compared with those with an optimal outcome (diagnosed before 5 years of age). The chart review identified 161 children with amblyopia who participated in this study; 75 had late diagnoses (case patients) and 86 served as control patients. Children with early diagnoses more often had the following characteristics: a positive family history of strabismus, greater degrees of strabismus (when strabismus was present), higher maternal educational level, greater parental suspicion that an eye problem existed, and an increased chance that the parents requested the eye examination that led to the diagnosis. The parents of children with late diagnoses expressed less concern over the seriousness of amblyopia but were more likely to report that their children had suffered adverse consequences of amblyopia. When diagnosed early, amblyopia was more often detected by the child's primary health care provider. Physicians of the children with early diagnoses more often reported compliance with both the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for vision screening in infancy and referral for vision problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Present knowledge of lung and airway development during infancy, determinants of peripheral airway patency, changes in lung surface activity in infants with SIDS, and fluid film dynamics in small airways are reviewed. It is hypothesized that many cases of SIDS may be due to a final episode of progressive peripheral bronchial occlusion in infants with preceding critically diminished conductance of the smaller airways.\r"

Rash was observed in six patients but was a prominent finding in only one. Leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were common laboratory abnormalities. Six patients were treated with tetracycline, three with chloramphenicol, and one was not treated with antibiotics: all recovered. The onset of illness in spring and early summer for most cases paralleled the time when Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis are most active, suggesting that one or both ticks may be vectors of human ehrlichiosis in Oklahoma.\r"

A total of 73% of responding physicians referred some pediatric patients for immunization in 1988. Public health clinics were the largest referral source with more responding pediatricians (84.4%) referring patients than did responding family practitioners (66.5%). Referrals to the clinics were most often made when patients were unable to afford immunizations in a private practice setting. Between 1979 and 1988, the number of responding pediatricians and family practitioners making immunization referrals increased by 193% and 391%, respectively. The percentages of children referred for immunization increased by 693% during the same decade. It was suggested by our survey of Dallas County physicians that a new influx of patients are using public sector immunizations, potentially creating additional financial stress for public health programs. In addition, this shift to the public sector may undermine the health departments' ability to provide new vaccines or protect greater numbers of children with immunization.\r"

However, the allergenic potential of these proteins may be a factor limiting their widespread use for disease prevention. An in vitro study with sera from milk- and egg-allergic children was performed to determine whether these immunoglobulin preparations have allergenic potential. Protein extracts of milk, bovine immunoglobulin, egg white, human immune globulin, and five egg yolk antiviral immunoglobulin preparations were bound to nitrocellulose paper. These preparations were probed for specific IgE binding with sera from milk- and egg-allergic patients. Of 22 milk-hypersensitive patients, 16 had specific IgE binding against the bovine immunoglobulin preparation. Of 28 egg-allergic patients 15 had specific IgE binding against one or more of the egg yolk-derived antiviral chicken immunoglobulins. Control sera were negative against the milk and egg preparations. Western blot analysis confirmed that milk- and egg-allergic patients had IgE-specific antibodies for bovine and chicken immunoglobulin molecules. Therefore, the removal of contaminating proteins from milk and egg antibody preparations would be unlikely to eliminate their allergenic potential. In contrast, sera from milk- and egg-allergic patients displayed no detectable IgE binding to human immunoglobulin preparations. These data indicate that the administration of antibody preparations derived from bovine and chicken sources may lead to severe allergic reactions in milk- or egg-sensitized patients and to sensitization in some nonallergic individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Infants who drank 2 mL of a 12% sucrose solution prior to blood collection cried 50% less during the blood collection procedure than did control infants who had received 2 mL of sterile water. Crying of infants who ingested sucrose returned to baseline levels within 30 to 60 seconds after blood collection whereas control infants required 2.5 to 3.0 minutes to return to baseline. Like findings were obtained for infants who received sucrose on a pacifier prior to and during circumcision. Specifically, control infants who underwent a standard circumcision procedure without intervention cried 67% of the time. A water-moistened pacifier reduced crying to 49% (P less than .01). Crying was reduced further to 31% (P less than .05) by providing infants with a sucrose-flavored pacifier to suck. These findings, which parallel results obtained in studies of pain in infant rats, provide a potent yet simple, benign intervention to help alleviate stress and pain routinely experienced by human infants.\r"

After adjustment for confounding, scores on the General Cognitive Index decreased approximately 3 points (SE = 1.4) for each natural log unit increase in 24-month blood lead level. The inverse association between lead level and performance was especially prominent for visual-spatial and visual-motor integration skills. Higher prenatal exposures were not associated with lower scores at 57 months except in the subgroup of children with \"high\" concurrent blood lead levels (ie, greater than or equal to 10 micrograms/dL). The concentration of lead in the dentine of shed deciduous teeth was not significantly associated with children's performance after adjustment for confounding.\r"

There is concern that neonates with phenylketonuria who are tested this early may be missed. To examine this question, the authors screened specimens collected during the first 24 hours of life from 23 neonates at risk for hyperphenylalaninemia. The blood phenylalanine level in each of the 6 neonates with phenylketonuria and a seventh with mild hyperphenylalaninemia was greater than 2 mg/dL as early as 4 hours of age and 6 mg/dL or greater by 24 hours of age. A newborn screening phenylalanine cutoff level of 2 mg/dL would have identified all of these neonates within the first 24 hours of life, but a cutoff level of 4 mg/dL would have missed 2 of the 6 with phenylketonuria before 24 hours of life. Newborn screening programs should adopt a blood phenylalanine level of 2 mg/dL as the cutoff for suspicion of phenylketonuria and request for a second specimen. Breast-fed affected neonates had higher early blood phenylalanine elevations than formula-fed neonates, perhaps reflecting the higher protein (phenylalanine) content of colostrum.\r"

This underscores the need for eliciting a detailed history when evaluating a patient with chest pain. If the pain cannot be clearly attributed to chest wall phenomena, or if there are historical or physical findings suggestive of an arrhythmia or angina, then further investigation with a chest radiograph and a 12-lead electrocardiogram is recommended. Myocarditis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of any child whose electrocardiogram is indistinguishable from an acute myocardial infarction. Finally, endomyocardial biopsy allows early diagnosis and institution of therapy, which may have beneficial effect on decreasing morbidity and mortality. Further follow-up and research is still needed to evaluate the effect of early treatment of myocarditis on long-term myocardial function and the development of chronic cardiomyopathy.\r"
