Total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were higher in meat eaters than vegans, with vegetarians and fish eaters having intermediate and similar values. High density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was highest in the fish eaters but did not differ among the other groups. There were striking trends with age in total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, which differed between men and women: women showed a steady increase in concentration with age, whereas concentrations in men did not increase appreciably after the age of 40, which may partly explain sex differences in the prevalence of coronary heart disease. The differences in total cholesterol concentration suggest that the incidence of coronary heart disease may be 24% lower in lifelong British vegetarians and 57% lower in lifelong vegans than in meat eaters.\r"

  ".W": "Intra-arterial blood pressure was compared with simultaneous auscultatory measurements in 37 subjects with a wide range of blood pressures and arm circumferences; six cuffs of various lengths and widths were used. Nineteen subjects had an arm circumference of 34 cm or more (mean 40 cm) and the other 18 were considered to be non-obese and had a mean arm circumference of 30 cm. With each larger cuff, in terms of bladder surface area, auscultatory blood pressure decreased a few mm relative to intra-arterial pressure both for systolic and for diastolic measurements. Apart from diastolic pressure measured with the two 12 cm wide cuffs (12 X 23 cm, 12 X 30 cm) in the obese group all other auscultatory measurements differed less than 5% from intra-arterial pressure, albeit with considerable variability among the subjects. The differences in error among measurements with the four largest cuffs in the obese group (13 X 30 cm, 14 X 30 cm, 14 X 38 cm, and a conical cuff) were clinically irrelevant, and there was even less to choose among all six cuffs in the non-obese subjects. These results suggest that auscultatory blood pressure may be measured with acceptable accuracy with a single long bladdered cuff both in subjects with large arms and in subjects with normal sized arms.\r"

There were significantly more unsuccessful pregnancies, mainly spontaneous abortions during the first and second trimesters, among women with persistent false positive results. There was no significant difference between groups in the mean birth weights of liveborn infants. The antibodies responsible for the false positive result may indicate the presence of an immunological disturbance. Women who give a false positive result should be carefully managed throughout their pregnancy.\r"

The pathogenesis of the arterial lesion is as complex as its rate of progression is variable and ill understood. In six patients undergoing coronary arteriography, who were being restudied before percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, the angiographic appearance deteriorated considerably over a fairly short period (mean 3.6 months). Although early detection and preventive measures have lowered the incidence of atheromatous disease and improved survival in some patients, rapid progression of the disease remains a serious hazard in others, who, as a group, remain at present unidentifiable.\r"

All subjects were fellows of the Faculty of Anaesthetists and held full registration with the General Medical Council. With all men in social class I being taken as the standard, the standardised mortality ratio among anaesthetists for all causes of death was 68 (95% confidence interval 59 to 77) and the standardised mortality ratio for all cancers was 50 (95% confidence interval 36 to 67). There was no significant excess mortality from lymphomas or leukaemias, but 16 of the 221 deaths in anaesthetists were due to suicide, giving a standardised mortality ratio of 202 (95% confidence interval 115 to 328). When anaesthetists were compared with all doctors the standardised mortality ratio for suicide was only 114, a nonsignificant excess. These findings confirm that the risk of suicide among anaesthetists is twice as high as among other men in social class I but suggest that the risk does not differ significantly from that among doctors as a whole. There was no evidence of a significant excess risk of cancer, and, in particular, the small excess of cancer of the pancreas reported previously could not be confirmed.\r"

The preoperative lactulose treatment group suffered significantly less pain on defecation for the first four days that they opened their bowels (visual analogue scores in cm: day 1, 4.4 v 5.9; day 2, 4.1 v 6.3; day 3, 4.5 v 6.1; day 4, 4.6 v 6.5), suffered significantly less pain during the first two 24 hour periods after defecation (visual analogue scores in cm: day 1, 5.0 v 7.0; day 2, 3.9 v 6.1), and required significantly less analgesia daily after defecation (0.76 g paracetamol/day v 1.29 g paracetamol/day). These results show that lactulose given for four days preoperatively reduces pain after haemorrhoidectomy.\r"

The use of the food tables overestimated mean (SEM) individual nutrient intakes by between 2.5% (1.5%) and 15.5% (3.0%). The mean errors associated with the dietary history assessment varied from -23% (7.8%) for fat intake to +21.4% (8.5%) for carbohydrate intake. Overall, 30% of the assessments of total nutrient intakes that were calculated using this method were within -20% to +20% of actual values; 18% were within -10% to +10%. The mean errors associated with the computer based assessment varied from -1.0% (4.3%) for carbohydrate intake to +8.5% (3.4%) for protein intake. Overall, 56% of the assessments of total nutrient intakes were within -20% to +20% of actual intakes; 31% were within -10% to +10%. The computer based system provides an accurate, reproducible, convenient, and inexpensive method for assessing dietary intake.\r"

This could not be explained by changes in sex hormone binding globulin capacity, hyperprolactinaemia, classical primary testicular failure, or a hypogonadotrophic state. Pulsatile release of luteinising hormone was found in control subjects but was absent or diminished in burnt patients with low serum testosterone concentrations. In addition, these patients showed reduced biological activity of luteinising hormone as measured by bioassay even though normal concentrations of luteinising hormone were detected by radioimmunoassay. The temporary hypogonadism after burns injury and possibly in other clinical states may be related to hypothalamic dysfunction, which leads to abnormal generation of luteinising hormone releasing hormone and non-pulsatile secretion of luteinising hormone of reduced biological activity.\r"

Abnormal laboratory findings resulted in 24 terminations of pregnancy (4.8%); in addition five unexpected balanced chromosome rearrangements were detected. Twelve of 15 cytogenetic discrepancies were detected at amniocentesis, two after termination, and one at spontaneous abortion. Complete follow up data were available for the first 250 patients, among whom nine pregnancies (3.6%) ended in spontaneous abortion before the 20th week. There were no false negative findings. Seventy additional chromosome studies were performed because of failure of chorionic villi sampling or equivocal results, or for confirmation. Counselling before chorionic villi sampling should include the possibility that subsequent amniocentesis may be needed should mosaicism or other unexpected abnormalities be found. The success rate and accuracy of karyotyping chorionic villi samples by the direct method are acceptable but distinctly less than those of karyotyping cultured amniotic fluid cells.\r"

Twenty four patients from this register were visited early in winter by a doctor to discuss how hypothermia could be prevented. They were then revisited during very cold weather to see whether they had made any changes. Several improvements to heating arrangements were noted, but the median temperature in the bedrooms of houses with no central heating was 10 degrees C below the World Health Organisation's recommended temperature. In addition, eight patients were not visited daily. Even with media publicity and visits from carers and a doctor, 17 of the 24 elderly people studied continued to live in an environment in which they were at risk of developing hypothermia.\r"

As a result an alternative counselling and screening clinic for testing for antibodies to HIV was established for use by drug abusers. Four hundred and forty one patients were counselled in the first year, and over 60% were either drug abusers or their sexual contacts. One hundred and fourteen (26%) patients were positive for HIV antibody, and 100 (88%) of these were current or former drug abusers. The HIV seropositivity rate in drug abusers was 52% but was only 7% in their sexual contacts. Services were provided for these people as well as counselling before and after the test. The cost of this counselling service for the first year was 27,000 pounds or 61.22 pounds per patient. The unexpected mobility of 23% of the Edinburgh drug abusers, particularly to other areas of Britain, suggests that similar services need to be set up elsewhere.\r"

  ".W": "Very high survival rates have been observed in four through 11 years of follow-up in 4,240 women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP). The relative five, eight, and 10-year survival rates were 88, 83, and 79 percent, respectively. Allowances were made for lead-time bias among cancers detected through screening, and the validity of the findings was supported by internal analyses, which showed that length-time bias was of little, if any, importance, and that any possible \"overdiagnosis\" of cancer cases was also of small relevance. In view of current interest in the value of screening women before age 50, intensive analyses were made comparing the BCDDP data for women in their 40s with women in their 50s. In terms of kinds of breast cancers found, modality of finding them, and survival rates once they have been found, the parallel results for the two groups show that screening was virtually as effective in the younger as in the older women. Some authorities are of the opinion that the benefits of mammography after age 50 are well documented, but at younger ages the evidence is still inconclusive. The findings in this study show there is no doubt of the very successful results of screening for breast cancer with mammography in younger as well as older women. In comparing relative five-year and eight-year survival rates for women with invasive breast cancers detected through screening in the BCDDP, with those for cases diagnosed in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (NCI SEER) program from 1977 to 1982, it is seen that for individual subcategories by tumor size and nodal class, the survival rates are about the same. However, for overall invasive cancers, the five-year and eight-year survival rates were 87 and 81 percent, respectively, for the BCDDP compared with 74 and 65 percent for SEER. Thus the substantial gains in survival followed the large shift toward a high proportion of cancers being diagnosed and treated in more favorable stages through the screening accomplishments. With respect to the relative case fatality rates, the complements of the relative survival rates, the eight-year rate of 19 percent for the BCDDP versus that of 35 percent for SEER connotes 46 percent fewer women dying in the BCDDP group.\r"

The Con A, WGA, DBA, PNA and RCA I bound to both normal and hyperplastic glands. The binding in the malignant glands differed from that of the benign conditions. The SBA, which was not bound by benign cells, was bound to the malignant glandular cells. Also, UEA I was bound to a part of the carcinoma cells. In addition, the binding pattern of Con A and WGA in the cells differed between the malignant and benign conditions. Based on the results of this study, it is suggested that lectin histochemical study might be useful in routine pathologic examination to detect malignant cells in cases which are doubtful with regard to malignancy by routine methods.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on proximal epicardial coronary artery dimensions and coronary blood flow were examined in 7 awake dogs chronically instrumented with miniature coronary dimension crystals and Doppler flow probes on the circumflex coronary artery. ANP (10, 50, and 150 micrograms) was infused as a bolus via the left atrial catheter. Aortic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, heart rate, and dP/dt did not change significantly with any dose of ANP. ANP caused transient (1-5 minutes) dose-related increases in coronary blood flow; maximum increases were 28.1 +/- 6.9%, 40.2 +/- 6.2%, and 73.9 +/- 12.5% with the 10-, 50-, and 150-micrograms doses, respectively. ANP also induced prolonged (average 70.2 +/- 28.6 minutes with 150-micrograms dose) dose-related increases in coronary diameter; maximum increases were 3.1 +/- 1.0%, 3.9 +/- 1.5%, and 5.7 +/- 1.3% with the 10-, 50-, and 150-micrograms doses, respectively. The increase in diameter was not attenuated when the transient increase in blood flow was prevented by partial occlusion with a pneumatic snare. Combined autonomic blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg), phentolamine (1 mg/kg), and atropine (0.06 mg/kg) attenuated the relative increase in coronary flow but did not alter the increases in epicardial coronary diameter produced by ANP. These data demonstrate that bolus injection of ANP effects preferential, sustained, dose-dependent, flow-independent increases in epicardial coronary dimensions and relatively brief dose-dependent increases in coronary blood flow. The vasodilator effects of ANP on epicardial vessels are direct and are not mediated via the autonomic nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The radioligand was [3H]batrachotoxinin A 20 alpha-benzoate ([3H]BTXB), a toxin that binds to the sodium channel. The 8 drugs tested inhibited [3H]BTXB binding in a dose-dependent fashion with IC50 values from 1.34 microM for O-demethylencainide to 811 microM for procainamide. A log-log plot of IC50 versus mean therapeutic serum concentration yielded a regression line with slope of 1.17 and r of 0.95. Scatchard analysis of [3H]BTXB binding showed that lidocaine reduced the maximal binding without altering the KD for [3H]BTXB binding, indicating allosteric inhibition. The inhibition by lidocaine of [3H]BTXB binding was reversible within 30 minutes when the samples were diluted from 390 to 39 microM lidocaine. In other studies, the stereoisomers of tocainide were shown to have a threefold to fourfold difference in IC50 for inhibition of [3H]BTXB binding. The binding of antiarrhythmic drugs to this site is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific and occurs at pharmacologically relevant concentrations with similar rank order of potency in vivo and in vitro. This suggests that binding at this site relates to pharmacologic activity.\r"

In this investigation, we studied the effects of the chemotactic peptide N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and bradykinin (BK) on eicosanoid synthesis and renal vascular resistance in the ex vivo perfused hydronephrotic kidney (HNK). Administration of fMLP resulted in the dose-dependent synthesis of leukotrienes, thromboxane A2 (TXA2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and prostacyclin (PGI2). Peptidoleukotriene synthesis was monitored by specific radioimmunoassay and by guinea pig ileum bioassay and it was then validated by inhibition of the ileal contractile activity with the peptidoleukotriene receptor antagonist FPL-55712. The leukotrienes produced were identified as LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 by comigration with authentic standards on reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and by ultraviolet spectroscopy. BK administration stimulated the synthesis of TXA2, PGE2, and PGI2 but not the synthesis of leukotrienes, in contrast to the results with fMLP, suggesting the involvement of different cell types. Administration of fMLP to the HNK also resulted in a renal vasoconstriction that was partially inhibited by FPL-55712 and that was completely inhibited by the thromboxane synthase inhibitor OKY-1581. Consistent with this result, exogenous administration of LTC4 resulted in the synthesis of TXA2 and in a renal vasoconstriction that was inhibited by either FPL-55712 or OKY-1581.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Synthetic alpha-human ANP (alpha-hANP) was infused at a rate of 0.03 microgram/kg/min in 8 healthy men (mean age 23 +/- 0.7 years, mean +/- SEM). The alpha-hANP decreased systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) but did not significantly alter resting heart rate and forearm vascular resistance (FVR). The magnitudes of reflex increases in FVR during lower body negative pressure (LBNP) at -110, -20, and -40 mm Hg were less during infusion of alpha-ANP than those magnitudes during infusion of saline solution. The slope of the regression line relating changes in CVP and those in FVR was less during infusion of alpha-hANP than the slope during infusion of saline solution. Forearm vascular responses to intra-arterial infusion of norepinephrine at doses of 100, 200, and 500 ng/min did not significantly differ during infusion of alpha-hANP and saline solution. These results suggest that alpha-hANP attenuates cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of FVR in normal men.\r"

  ".W": "The subtypes of postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptors activated by neuronally released and exogenous norepinephrine and the source of calcium used for vasoconstrictor responses were investigated in the feline mesenteric vascular bed. Under constant flow conditions, intra-arterial injections of phenylephrine and UK14304, alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, increased mesenteric arterial perfusion pressure in a dose-related manner. Prazosin, an alpha 1-antagonist, reduced vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine without altering responses to UK14304. Yohimbine, an alpha 2-antagonist, reduced responses to UK14304 without altering responses to phenylephrine. The same pattern of blockade was observed in animals pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine to destroy the integrity of adrenergic terminals. Responses to phenylephrine and UK14304 were reduced by nitrendipine, a calcium-entry blocking agent, and this agent decreased vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation, tyramine, and norepinephrine. Responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were selectively blocked by prazosin, but responses to norepinephrine were selectively blocked by yohimbine. Vasoconstrictor responses to tyramine were reduced by both prazosin and yohimbine. Nitrendipine also reduced responses to angiotensin II, U46619, a prostaglandin endoperoxide analogue, Bay K 8644, and potassium chloride. These data suggest the presence of alpha 1- and postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors and support the hypothesis that norepinephrine released by nerve excitation acts mainly on alpha 1-receptors but that exogenous norepinephrine acts primarily on alpha 2-receptors. However, norepinephrine released by tyramine acts on both receptor subtypes. Nitrendipine inhibited responses to the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists as well as those to nerve released and exogenous norepinephrine, the calcium agonist, Bay K 8644, and to other vasoconstrictor agents. These data suggest that in the feline mesenteric vascular bed, an extracellular source of calcium ions is required for vasoconstriction induced by a variety of mechanisms including activation of alpha 1- and postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment with pertussis toxin not only prevents inhibitory effects (e.g., reduced adenylate cyclase activity, decreased voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry, increased K+ efflux, and negative inotropy) but also unmasks stimulant effects (e.g., membrane depolarization and positive inotropy) of carbachol in chick atria. Pertussis toxin prevents transducer proteins (Ni and No) from linking muscarinic receptors to either adenylate cyclase and Ca2+ channels or K+ channels. However, pertussis toxin treatment does not block N proteins linking the muscarinic receptor to stimulant membrane effects. Membrane depolarization by carbachol, attributed by others to increased Na+ entry, may stimulate Na-Ca exchange and positive inotropy, perhaps by activation of phospholipase D. Alternatively, carbachol could increase inositol triphosphate content and thereby release Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to increase the force of contraction. The ability of carbachol to increase phosphoinositide hydrolysis is resistant to pertussis toxin. The second-messenger role of phospholipid metabolites provides a foundation for testing the hypothesis that such metabolites are eventually involved in the stimulant actions of carbachol seen in pertussis toxin-treated preparations.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava results in decreased filling pressure and cardiac output, in augmented secretion rates of renin and aldosterone, and in marked sodium retention with ascites and edema formation. The goal of the present study was to determine temporal changes in the plasma concentration of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (iANF) in response to chronic constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava in the conscious dog. Following constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava, all dogs retained sodium avidly for at least 10 days, and both plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration increased markedly (p less than 0.05). Additionally, the baseline plasma iANF of 70 +/- 5 pg/ml decreased significantly to 24 +/- 7, 26 +/- 10, and 34 +/- 11 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) on days 2, 6, and 10 following thoracic inferior vena cava constriction. Thus, chronic sodium retention in this model is associated with prolonged endocrine adjustments in the circulating levels of renin-aldosterone and iANF. We suggest that chronic decreases in the secretion of atrial natriuretic factor might contribute to the inability of the dog with constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava to excrete sodium normally.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial distension, rather than change in intra-atrial pressure, has been suggested as a principal mediator of release of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). During cardiac tamponade, atrial pressures rise whereas transmural pressures and atrial stretch may not be affected. The roles of atrial pressure and atrial distension were investigated in six open-chest dogs subjected to cardiac tamponade and rapid volume expansion as disparate means of affecting intra-atrial pressures and atrial stretch. Hemodynamic measurements, immunoreactive ANF (ir-ANF), plasma renin activity, antidiuretic hormone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were monitored before, during, and after three interventions: (1) tamponade, (2) rapid volume loading followed by tamponade, and (3) volume loading during tamponade. Volume expansion increased right atrial pressure and caused a significant rise in ir-ANF. Elevations of right atrial pressure caused by tamponade were comparable to those induced by volume infusion, but an increase in ir-ANF was not elicited during tamponade, and the ir-ANF response to volume loading was abolished when performed during tamponade. The relation between the change in ANF concentration and change in right atrial pressure were highly significant in the absence of tamponade, when atrial stretch was freely responsive to volume expansion (r = .73, p less than .0001), but not when stretch was inhibited (r = -.16, p = NS). These observations underscore the importance of considering the modulating effects of atrial compliance, transmural pressure, and atrial stretch on the relation between atrial pressures and ANF release.\r"

Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro in rings of proximal left anterior descending coronary arteries taken from control and treated animals studied in parallel. Endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to bradykinin, serotonin, adenosine diphosphate, and thrombin were facilitated in arteries from treated but not in those from control animals, whereas the relaxations in response to A23187 were unaltered. The facilitated relaxations were not altered by indomethacin but significantly inhibited by methylene blue. Aggregating platelets from control and treated pigs induced comparable, facilitated endothelium-dependent relaxations in rings taken from treated pigs. The platelet-induced contractions were significantly reduced in rings with endothelium taken from treated pigs, and they were comparable in rings without endothelium in both groups. Aggregating platelets from control and treated pigs released comparable amounts of serotonin and thromboxane A2. Endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid were unaltered, whereas transient endothelium-dependent contractions induced by arachidonic acid were significantly reduced by the treatment with cod-liver oil. Relaxations to sodium nitroprusside or isoproterenol,and contractions to potassium chloride or serotonin were not different in rings without endothelium from control or treated pigs. These results indicate that dietary supplementation with cod-liver oil facilitates endothelium-dependent relaxations and inhibits endothelium-dependent contractions in porcine coronary arteries.\r"

WI induced a prompt fall in MAP in all examined groups. This decrease of MAP was maximal after 1 h WI, showing a tendency to rise later on in pregnant women. Simultaneously a decrease of plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone, AVP and an increase of ANF was noted. The WI induced endocrine reaction pattern was qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different in the examined groups. In contrast to the response of non-pregnant women, healthy pregnant women and women with EPH gestosis showed a significantly smaller increase in ANF secretion induced by WI. No correlation was found between PRA, plasma AVP, aldosterone and ANF respectively. In addition changes in PRA, aldosterone, AVP and ANF did not correlate with WI-induced changes in MAP. From data obtained in this paper it seems, that WI-induced MAP changes are not related significantly to changes of the above mentioned hormonal factors.\r"

From their data, the authors concluded that hCG is not indicated if patients present elevated LH and FSH levels or if the basal T levels are in the pubertal range. In the other subjects, the hCG test will permit the determination of the presence or absence of testosterone production and in some cases it results in testicular descent.

Compared with the control group, AP-III and frusemide increased urinary sodium excretion (UNa V, 5.6 +/- 1.1 and 4.6 +/- 0.6 vs control 1.8 +/- 0.3 mumol min-1 g-1, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively), fractional sodium excretion (FENa, 4.8 +/- 1.1 and 6.7 +/- 0.8 vs control 2.0 +/- 0.2%, P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.001, respectively) and potassium excretion (UKV, 3.2 +/- 0.3 and 3.0 +/- 0.3 vs control 1.5 +/- 0.3 mumol min-1 g-1, both P less than 0.01). However, AP-III, but not frusemide, increased glomerular filtration rate (820 +/- 55 vs 590 +/- 24 microliter min-1 g-1, P less than 0.01) and urine flow rate (V 97.5 +/- 8.0 vs 44.1 +/- 5.2 microliter min-1 g-1, P less than 0.001). Calculated distal delivery of sodium (CNa +/- CH2O, 76.6 +/- 6.8 vs 30.7 +/- 3.8 microliter min-1 g-1, P less than 0.005) as well as fractional distal delivery of sodium [(CNa +/- CH2O)/CIn, 9.4 +/- 0.9 vs 5.1 +/- 0.6%, P less than 0.01] were increased by AP-III, but not frusemide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The time course of the response of ventilation (V) and mean alveolar PCO2 (PACO2) was checked in separate experiments, where the flow rate of injected CO2 was changed abruptly and the effects were followed for 10 min. 3. V and PACO2 were measured every breath, and the results ensemble-averaged for each subject (two or three runs per subject) and then for the groups as a whole, in 30 s or 60 s time bins. 4. PACO2 during exercise was estimated by graphical reconstruction from the sloping alveolar plateau, and separately by the empirical equation of Jones, Robertson & Kane [1]. At rest, PACO2 was assumed equal to end-tidal PCO2 (PetCO2). 5. With the constant inflow technique, 4 min was required to reach steady-state V and PACO2 during exercise, and 6 min at rest. 6. At rest, with 4 min steps (doubtful steady state) the averaged CO2 response was concave up. With 6 min steps the response was almost linear. In neither case was the deviation from linearity statistically significant. 7.

  ".W": "1. The present studies were undertaken to investigate whether intracisternal administration of pergolide, a dopamine-2 receptor agonist, triggers the release of an inhibitor of ouabain-sensitive sodium, potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase into the circulation and whether such an effect is associated with increases in vascular reactivity in pentobarbital anaesthetized dogs. In different groups of animals, Na+-pump activity was estimated in the plantar and dorsal branches of the lateral saphenous veins by using the 86Rb-uptake method; vascular responsiveness to noradrenaline was studied in the denervated perfused hindlimb. 2. Na+-pump activity was significantly depressed in those blood vessels which were collected at 90 min after central administration of pergolide (12.5 micrograms/kg intracisternally). In perfused hindlimb studies, vascular responses to noradrenaline were significantly enhanced between 60 and 90 min after pergolide. Since the Na+-pump activity was evaluated in the hindlimb veins, and vascular reactivity was studied on the arterial circulation, the data suggest that the changes in both these variables could have been caused by a circulating substance. 3. In separate series of experiments, plasma samples were collected before and after intracisternal administration of pergolide. The Na+-pump activity was significantly inhibited in the segments of lateral saphenous veins which were incubated in the fresh plasma and/or boiled plasma supernatants, indicating that a heat stable pump inhibitor(s) is released into the circulation after pergolide administration. 4. Effects of pergolide demonstrated in the present study are qualitatively similar to those reported to occur after acute blood volume expansion. Hence it is proposed that central dopaminergic mechanisms may play an intermediary role in the release of the Na+-pump inhibitor(s).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The urinary recovery of all the intravenously administered markers was close to 100%. Distribution volumes and patterns of excretion were virtually identical. Oxidation of intravenously administered mannitol accounted for only about 1% of the dose. 4. The passage of an orally administered mixture of markers was traced through the intestine and into urine. Transit time through the gastrointestinal tract was measured by the breath hydrogen method and by radionuclide scanning. 5. The passage of markers from mouth to the large bowel was essentially complete by 3.5 h. In some subjects the marker appeared in the large bowel as early as 30-40 min but in others it took three times as long. 6.

The results were compared with those obtained previously when subjects were fed. The effects of fasting on protein and leucine metabolism were a significant decrease in protein synthesis from 127 (SEM 11; n = 6) to 70 (SEM 6; n = 12) nmol of leucine min-1 100 ml-1 of forearm tissue (P less than 0.001) and a marked decrease in leucine catabolism in the forearm muscle. 4.

During the saline infusion, there was a significant increase in plasma ANP and urinary sodium excretion and a significant decrease in plasma renin activity, aldosterone, albumin, creatinine and packed cell volume. 3. The maximal rise in mean plasma ANP occurred 15 min after stopping the infusion and the maximal rise in mean urinary sodium excretion in the collection period 30 min later. 4. Plasma ANP then decreased so that by the end of the study the level was the same as before the saline infusion. However, at this time, 195 min after the saline infusion was stopped, there was still a net positive sodium balance of 220 mmol and urinary sodium excretion remained significantly elevated. 5. Our results are compatible with the concept that increased ANP secretion may play a role in the immediate increase in sodium excretion after a saline load. However, they also suggest that other mechanisms may be more important for the longer term increase in sodium excretion.\r"

In these patients voluntary copying of either form of stimulated breathing resulted in diminished breathlessness and in some cases in complete abolition of the sensation, despite similar levels and patterns of ventilation in the two situations. 4. No systematic or consistent differences in the mechanics of breathing between stimulated and voluntarily copied breathing were found. 5. There was no correlation found between breathlessness score and any mechanical variable measured. 6. These results show that despite similarity in mechanics between stimulated and voluntary hyperventilation, the sensation of breathlessness is much diminished during the latter in these patients. This suggests that the sensation of breathlessness is more dependent upon the awareness of central processing than upon input from peripheral mechanoreceptors.\r"

To investigate whether changes in PaCO2 can be detected independently of the CO2-induced changes in pulmonary ventilation, we tested five normal subjects for the ability to distinguish different levels of end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) while holding minute ventilation constant. 2. Helped by a visual feedback system, the subjects maintained a constant ventilation targeted at a level that was higher than that dictated by the chemical drive at PETCO2 = 50 mmHg (6.7 kPa). End-tidal PCO2 was held at 40 mmHg (5.3 kPa) during the first 2 min of each test trial ('control period'); then, for 4 min ('test period'), PETCO2 was either elevated to 50 mmHg or kept at 40 mmHg. Twelve runs were performed by each subject. 3. In 24 out of the total 30 trials (80%) in which PETCO2 was raised during the test period to 50 mmHg, the subjects detected the changes. There was one false positive result (3%), when PETCO2 kept at 40 mmHg during the test period was reported as different from control. In four out of the five subjects the ability to detect the change in PETCO2 from 40 to 50 mmHg was statistically significant. 4. We conclude that increases in PETCO2 can be detected independently of changes in the absolute level of ventilation.\r"

The resulting score, which reflects the severity of multiple organ dysfunction and grades responsiveness to therapy, was validated against the actual disease course. Retrospective and prospective profiles of individual surgical ICU patients demonstrated that this tracking method was a more effective indicator of severity of sepsis and more sensitive to the day-to-day changes in clinical status than either the TISS or APACHE II components alone.

In our ICU, patients who have not undergone recent bowel surgery are treated by EN. Those patients who cannot tolerate EN are treated by total parenteral nutrition (TPN). One hundred and eleven patients who tolerated EN (functioning gut) and 97 TPN patients who failed to tolerate EN (GI dysfunction) were studied. The mean APACHE II scores of the two groups were 17.7 +/- 6.5 (SD) and 17.7 +/- 5.1, respectively. The observed mortality of patients with GI dysfunction (51%) was significantly higher (p less than .0005) than that of patients with a functioning gut (25%). This was associated with significantly poorer APACHE II mean BP, oxygenation, and creatinine scores among the GI dysfunction patients. Our results suggest that shock, ischemia, and hypoxemia, in addition to causing impairment of renal function, may bring about changes in the GI tract, evident clinically only as a failure to tolerate EN, which have an adverse effect on the prognosis of ICU patients so affected.\r"

The average half-times of each compartment were 19.2 +/- 3.1 (SD) sec for the fast compartment and 108.1 +/- 23.8 sec for the slow compartment; the fast compartment of the CO2 elimination curve suggested that CO2 was eliminated from the functional residual capacity, while the slow compartment indicated CO2 elimination from the pulmonary capillary blood and tissue stores. Neither pretreatment with sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg iv) nor a 5-min cardiorespiratory arrest altered the mode of CO2 elimination. The ETCO2 also reflected the potential effects of external cardiac compressions on pulmonary blood flow, as previously reported. Besides mixed venous blood CO2 flowing back to the lungs by cardiac compressions, it should be noted that both alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood CO2 are also reflected in the ETCO2 during the first minute of CPR.\r"

Paired samples of inspired and expired gases were obtained, and exhaled minute volume was measured in 12 patients receiving supplemental oxygen, intermittent mandatory ventilation, and PEEP. Gas volume was measured with a calibrated spirometer and oxygen and CO2 fractions were measured by mass spectrometry. Measured and derived values were compared to those obtained from the MGM connected in series with the ventilator circuit. There were no statistically significant differences between values obtained from the mass spectrometer/spirometer vs. the MGM in exhaled volume (8.60 +/- 3.81 vs. 8.58 +/- 3.72 [SD] L/min), fraction of inspired oxygen (0.451 +/- 0.011 vs. 0.452 +/- 0.010), fraction of expired oxygen (0.413 +/- 0.013 vs. 0.415 +/- 0.012), VO2 (290 +/- 113 vs. 275 +/- 88 ml/min), VCO2 (245 +/- 95 vs. 247 +/- 96 ml/min), or respiratory quotient (0.85 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.88 +/- 0.08). The fraction of expired CO2 measured by the MGM was significantly greater (0.034 +/- 0.006 vs. 0.035 +/- 0.006; p less than .001) than that measured by mass spectrometer/spirometer. Twelve additional patients were studied to compare metabolic measurements made on 45% oxygen with those made at other fraction of inspired oxygen values.

We believe that the lower respiratory quotient and greater oxygen consumption during exercise were due to a reduction in anaerobic metabolism after TPN.\r"

Twenty-three percent of our patients were ultimately found not to have pulmonary edema, with pneumonia and/or exacerbations of chronic lung disease the most frequent alternate diagnoses. Group A patients had significantly greater improvement, both subjectively and objectively, than group B patients, a substantial number of whom failed to improve, or even worsened. There was no evident synergistic effect of any of the drugs, and some indication that furosemide might have caused clinically important problems with fluid and electrolyte management in some of the patients. Our data suggest that nitroglycerin is beneficial in the management of presumed pre-hospital pulmonary edema, while morphine and furosemide may not add anything to its efficacy, and may be potentially deleterious in some of these patients.\r"

Multiple myeloma was diagnosed on the basis of monoclonal IgG-lambda protein in serum, monoclonal lambda light chains in urine, a bone marrow plasmacytosis of 22 percent, and serum IgA and IgM levels less than 100 mg/dl and 50 mg/dl, respectively. Appropriate investigations failed to show additional sites of deposition of amyloid. Analysis of fluid from bronchoalveolar lavage showed an increase in total cells recovered, a lymphocytosis with a ratio of T helper over T suppressor cells greater than that in peripheral blood, the presence of an IgG-lambda paraprotein, and an IgG/albumin ratio greater than that in serum. While plasma cells could not be identified in the recovered cell population, cultured cells from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed increased production of IgG. These findings provide evidence of an ongoing pulmonary immune response resulting in excess IgG-lambda protein in the pulmonary compartment, a factor which may contribute to the development of amyloidosis.\r"

In a clinical study of 14 patients, the most common initial symptoms were abdominal distention or right lower quadrant pain suggestive of appendicitis. All patients underwent radical procedures in an attempt to surgically remove all gross disease from the abdomen. Six patients had small-bowel obstruction and five of these had bowel function restored. All of eight patients had relief from bulky intra-abdominal tumors. Six cycles of intraperitoneal 5-FU and three doses of mitomycin C were used following cytoreductive surgery in seven patients. Five of these seven patients are disease free following staging by celiotomy with two- to four-year follow-up. This new treatment strategy, designed to cure some patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei, has given favorable results in a disease that previously had a uniformly lethal outcome.\r"

This suggests that hepatitis might have been contracted in Asia or Africa in the former, and in France in the latter. The interval between the onset of jaundice and the onset of hepatic encephalopathy was 10 days in the former and 26 days in the latter (P less than 0.03). The serum of the patient returning from Asia contained, and the sera of the nine patients returning from Africa did not contain, antibodies to a virus isolated from the stools of patients suffering from an epidemic fecal-oral non-A, non-B viral hepatitis in Central Asia. It is concluded that infection with Asian-African non-A, non-B viruses can be the cause of fulminant hepatitis in persons returning from these countries, that the course of this type of non-A, non-B fulminant viral hepatitis is shorter than that of non-A, non-B fulminant hepatitis contracted in France, and that different viruses might be responsible for non-A, non-B hepatitis in Asia and Africa.\r"

In this article, we have described the epidemiology, recognized patterns of spread, and associated findings of gynecologic tumors. The proper Emergency Department evaluation and management of these problems is emphasized with guidelines for the timing of referrals and consultation with the gynecologic oncologist. The treatment of gynecologic malignancies is often complicated and responsible for Emergency Department visits. The various modalities are addressed according to the organ systems affected and include sections on postoperative problems, gastrointestinal complaints, urologic complications of therapy, radiation therapy and its complications, with an emphasis on the most serious complications necessitating either careful outpatient management or hospital admission. As cost-containment pressure grows, we have included sections on chemotherapy and total parenteral nutrition, both of which are becoming common outpatient events for the cancer patient.\r"

  ".U": "88004283\r", 
  ".W": "To characterize thyroid hormone action on the ovary, the direct effects of T4 or T3 were investigated in vitro using a monolayer culture system of porcine granulosa cells. Monolayer cultures were maintained for 6 days in 4% serum-supplemented medium in the absence or presence of porcine FSH (20 ng/ml), with or without graded doses of T4 or T3. Combined treatment with FSH and T4 (10(-7) M) induced morphological alternation resembling epithelioid cells, while FSH alone or T4 alone failed to bring about the epithelioid morphology. Concomitant treatment with FSH and T4 (10(-7) M) markedly increased FSH-stimulated induction of [125I]iodo-human CG binding to cultured granulosa cells obtained from small follicles. The combined treatment with FSH and T4 (10(-7) M) also resulted in a significant increase in progesterone and estrogen secretion by the cultured cells relative to treatment with FSH alone. Increases in progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol, and estrone secretion caused by the combined treatment with FSH and T4 (10(-7) M) were further augmented in response to the addition of exogenously provided substrate pregnenolone, testosterone, and androstenedione, respectively. Furthermore, aromatase activity assessed by the release of [3H]water from [1 beta-3H, 4-14C]androstenedione was significantly higher in cells treated concomitantly with FSH and T4 (10(-7) M) than that in cells treated with FSH alone. All the stimulatory effects of T4 (10(-7) M) on the morphological and functional differentiation of cultured granulosa cells were also found in combined treatment with FSH and T3 (10(-9) M). Either treatment with higher or lower concentrations of T4 or T3 gave attenuated effects, and T4 or T3 alone without FSH was incapable of exhibiting these stimulatory effects. These findings suggest that thyroid hormones synergize with FSH to exert direct stimulatory effects on granulosa cell functions, including morphological differentiation, LH/human CG receptor formation and steroidogenic enzyme (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and aromatase) induction. Hence, decreases in ovarian functions during the states of hypo- or hyperthyroidism may account for diminished responsiveness of the granulosa cells to FSH.\r"

We have compared the IGF II receptor from rat brain and rat liver. The brain receptor is of smaller apparent mol wt (about 10 K) on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This size difference is independent of ligand binding as it persists in iodinated and specifically immunoprecipitated receptors. From studies of wheat germ agglutinin binding and the effect of neuraminidase on receptor mobility, we conclude that this difference is not simply due to variations in sialic acid content. Treatment with endoglycosidase F results in reduction in the molecular size of both liver and brain receptors and after this treatment the aglycoreceptors are of similar size. We conclude that in rat brain tissue the IGF II receptor like the binding subunits of the insulin and IGF I receptors is of lower molecular size than the corresponding receptors in rat liver. This difference is due to differences in N-linked glycosylation.\r"

  ".W": "The observation that GH deficiency delays the onset of puberty has raised the question of the effect of GH on gonadal development. In addition, recent studies in the rat have indicated that GH is able to elevate ovarian levels of immunoreactive insulin-like growth factor I (iIGF-I) in vivo and enhance FSH-induced granulosa cell differentiation in vitro. To evaluate further the possibility of direct effects of GH on ovarian function, we have studied the action of GH on the secretion of iIGF-I and progesterone by cultured porcine granulosa cells from immature follicles. The effects of GH were compared with those of estradiol (E2) and FSH, hormones previously shown to stimulate steroidogenesis and iIGF-I production in this system. GH-stimulated cultures secreted 7.8 times as much iIGF-I per cell as control cultures, while cultures treated with E2 plus FSH secreted 4.5 times as much, and the combination of all three hormones produced an additional increment. The GH-dependent immunoreactivity was localized to two peaks on gel filtration which coeluted with authentic IGF-I and with an IGF-binding protein. In contrast to the results with iIGF-I secretion, GH was a relatively ineffective stimulator of progesterone secretion, resulting in levels 2.6 times the control value, compared to levels 7.4-fold the control value in cultures treated with E2 plus FSH. However, when the three agonists were combined, a synergistic interaction was observed which resulted in progesterone values 33.3 times the control value. In parallel studies, PRL was unable to mimic the effects of GH on iIGF-I or progesterone secretion. In summary, GH has direct stimulatory actions on porcine granulosa cells. Compared to E2 and FSH, established stimulators of these cells, GH is at least comparable in effectiveness with regard to iIGF-I secretion, but less effective as a stimulator of steroidogenesis. However, GH dramatically enhances the effects of E2 and FSH on progesterone secretion. These effects of GH could be important during the onset of puberty, when GH levels in plasma are elevated.\r"

  ".U": "88004317\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of human (h)GRF-(1-29)NH2 to stimulate GH secretion was studied in cannulated adult rats. In order to suppress endogenous GRF secretion and the inhibitory action of hypothalamic somatostatin (SRIF), rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Intravenous administration of hGRF-(1-29)NH2 elicited a dose-dependent response of plasma GH, with 250 ng/kg being the smallest effective dose in male rats. In female rats, for each dose tested (250 to 70,000 ng/kg), the GH response represented only about 60% that of male rats. Repeated iv stimulations with hGRF-(1-29)NH2 at short time intervals (45 min) produced transient desensitization of pituitary responsiveness to GRF: a blunted GH response to the second and third stimulations was observed both in male and in female rats and for each dose tested. Similar blunted responses were also obtained with repeated injections of native hGRF-(1-44)NH2. The possibility that these blunted responses could be due to incomplete suppression of hypothalamic SRIF secretion by sodium pentobarbital was excluded by the use of rats that were passively immunized against SRIF; in these rats, it was shown that at least 65% of the inhibition of the GH response after the second GRF stimulation was unrelated to SRIF action. Similar transient desensitization to repeated hGRF-(1-29)NH2 stimulations was also observed in conscious rats that were passively immunized against SRIF. This occurrence of blunted responses was shown to be related to the length of the time interval between GRF stimulations, with longer intervals resulting in less or no desensitization. It appears thus that modulation of pituitary responsiveness to the action of GRF is mediated by at least two independent mechanisms in the rat: in addition to the inhibitory action imposed by hypothalamic SRIF, which induces periods of refractoriness to the action of GRF, it was shown in this study that in the pituitary level each GRF stimulation also induces a transient desensitization of somatotrophs for about 1 h. This period of refractoriness might not be due to excessive stimulation with GRF, since it was also observed with the lowest dose of hGRF-(1-29)NH2 that gave a significant release of GH. Finally, a sex difference was confirmed for the response of anesthetized adult rats to stimulation with hGRF-(1-29)NH2, reflecting a sex steroid-induced modification of pituitary responsiveness to GRF stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of glycosylation of T4-binding globulin (TBG) in the secretion of the protein, human hepatoma (Hep G2) cells were continuously labeled with [35S] methionine or [3H]mannose or pulse-chase labeled with [35S] methionine in the absence or presence of 1 microgram/ml swainsonine, an inhibitor of Golgi alpha-mannosidase II and lysosomal alpha-mannosidase. In the presence of this alkaloid, TBG was released into the medium at a faster rate than in control cells (50% being secreted after 35 min and 47 min, respectively), owing to accelerated intracellular transport of the newly synthesized protein. TBG secreted from swainsonine-treated cultures moved faster in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, probably because of the reduced sialylation of TBG consequent to the perturbed processing of the oligosaccharide units. Furthermore, secreted TBG was sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion as shown by the shift in the apparent molecular size in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis from 50,000 to 45,000 daltons. Sensitivity to endo H indicated the presence of hybrid-type oligosaccharide chains with high mannose structures. This was also suggested by the higher incorporation of [3H]mannose in swainsonine-treated cultures. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that swainsonine accelerates the release of TBG from Hep G2 cells and that complete processing of oligosaccharide moieties is not required for TBG secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that removal of the posterior pituitary abolished the suckling-induced rise in plasma PRL. This suggested that the posterior pituitary contains a PRL-releasing factor (PRF). Using perifused anterior pituitary cells, the objectives of this study were 1) to examine whether the posterior pituitary contains PRF activity as compared to the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH), and 2) to determine to what extent substances known to be present in the posterior pituitary and/or MBH contribute to this activity. Anterior pituitary cells, attached to Cytodex beads, were perifused with medium 199. Tissues were extracted with acid, lyophilized, and reconstituted in medium 199. Tissue extracts and synthetic compounds were introduced to the cells in short pulses. Fractions were collected and analyzed for PRL, LH, and GH by RIA. Posterior pituitary extracts contained a potent substance(s) which stimulated PRL release in a concentration-dependent manner, but did not alter LH secretion. As little as 1% of the extract increased PRL release. In contrast, the MBH extract contained significantly less PRF activity but was capable of stimulating and inhibiting LH and GH release, respectively. Cerebellar extracts did not alter PRL secretion. Of more than 25 neuroactive substances tested in the perifusion system, oxytocin, TRH, and angiotensin II (A II) appeared as likely candidates for PRF. Therefore, the specific receptor antagonists d(CH2)5Tyr(Me) ornithine vasotocin (for oxytocin), chlordiazepoxide (for TRH), or saralasin (for A II) were infused together with the posterior pituitary extract. These antagonists completely abolished the PRL-releasing activities of their respective peptides but failed to reduce the PRF activity of the posterior pituitary. In contrast, PRF activity in the MBH was nearly eliminated by the TRH antagonist. Conclusions: 1) The rat posterior pituitary contains a potent PRF capable of inducing a rapid, hormone-specific, concentration-dependent stimulation of PRL release from perifused anterior pituitary cells. 2) The MBH contains significantly less PRF activity, which is largely attributable to TRH. 3) Although the chemical identity of PRF is yet unknown, the PRF activity in the posterior pituitary is not accounted for by oxytocin, TRH, or A II.\r"

  ".U": "88004327\r", 
  ".W": "Unlike most secretory cells, high extracellular Ca2+ inhibits, rather than stimulates, PTH release from parathyroid cells. To gain more direct access to the potentially unique secretory apparatus of this cell type, we developed techniques for permeabilizing parathyroid cells using electroshock. Exposure of dispersed bovine parathyroid cells to five 2-kV discharges results in more than 90% uptake of trypan blue and rapid loss of intracellular 86Rb, documenting permeabilization of the plasma membrane. Unlike intact parathyroid cells, a high Ca2+ concentration increases PTH release 2.8-fold from permeabilized cells, with half-maximal and maximal stimulation at 10(-5) and 4 X 10(-4) M Ca2+, respectively, a pattern similar to classical stimulus-secretion coupling. Moreover, PTH release was low at Ca2+ concentrations equivalent to those in intact cells at low extracellular Ca2+ levels (approximately 2 X 10(-7) M). Cellular mechanisms other than changes in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration per se, therefore, presumably mediate low Ca2+-stimulated PTH release in the intact cell. Diacylglycerol and protein kinase C may play a role in this process, since dioctanoylglycerol (10(-4) M) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (10(-6) M) each enhance PTH release from permeabilized cells 2- to 4-fold at a Ca2+ concentration (approximately 2 X 10(-7) M) equivalent to that present in the intact cell at low extracellular Ca2+ concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Clobazam was compared with placebo as antiepileptic adjunct medication in 129 therapy-resistant epileptic patients who were mainly suffering from complex partial seizures. The study was performed in five European countries according to a double-blind crossover design lasting 7 months. Two treatment periods of 3 months (1 month adjustment and 2 months maintenance medication) were separated by one medication switch-over month. The difference in seizure reduction between clobazam and placebo was significant (p less than 0.05). Nineteen percent of patients receiving clobazam became seizure-free during the maintenance dose period. In contrast, freedom from seizures was not observed in any placebo patient. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signs, mood ratings, and global impressions also indicated therapeutic effects of clobazam in epilepsy. The most frequent adverse reactions to clobazam were drowsiness and dizziness. However, the sedative effects of clobazam seemed to be less pronounced in comparison with other benzodiazepines. The study gives evidence of the therapeutic value of clobazam as adjunct medication in therapy-resistant partial seizures. The use of clobazam as monotherapy and long-term treatment, as well as the particular seizure response pattern to clobazam, has to be further investigated.\r"

In the SC group, a significant reduction in uterine volume occurred from a pretreatment volume of 368 +/- 60 (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) cm3 to 202 +/- 61 cm3 at 12 weeks of therapy (P less than 0.01) and to 172 +/- 49 cm3 at 24 weeks of therapy (P less than 0.005). In the IN group, no significant reduction in uterine volume occurred. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between the serum estradiol concentration during treatment and the percent decrease in uterine volume (r = -0.55, P less than 0.05). Four months after completing therapy, uterine volume increased to 296 +/- 104 cm3 in the SC group, which was not significantly different from pretreatment volume. These findings suggest that reduction in uterine volume depends on the degree of hypoestrogenism induced and that uterine volume increases soon after cessation of GnRH-a therapy.\r"

In a retrospective analysis, the authors analyzed potential factors in 45 menotropin-treated patients with spontaneous first-trimester miscarriages. Data were compared with 119 menotropin-treated patients who conceived and delivered viable infants. Patient factors that were analyzed included the following: age, history of past miscarriages, duration of infertility, diagnostic category, weight, body surface area, duration and weight-corrected dose of menotropin administration, maximum estradiol level, estradiol pattern, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) dose, presence or absence of hCG support in the luteal phase, results of postcoital testing, methods of insemination, and results of husband's semen analysis. There was a significant difference between the miscarriage group and the control group in regard to age and weight distribution. All other characteristics were not significantly different. Patients over 81.8 kg as well as patients aged 35 years and older were both significantly (P less than 0.01) at increased risk to have a spontaneous first-trimester miscarriage. The data suggest that obesity and advanced age contribute to the high miscarriage rate in menotropin-treated patients. It appears reasonable to suggest that women weighing more than 81.8 kg should make every effort to lose weight before beginning menotropin therapy.\r"

The cells were obtained from an in vitro fertilization protocol and were cultured for 2 to 12 days on plastic culture dishes or on dishes coated with extracellular matrix (ECM). During the first 2 to 4 days of culture, basal P production was high and could not be further stimulated with gonadotropins. Thereafter, basal P production decreased and could be stimulated by both hCG and FSH. The cells growing on ECM produced less P than the cells growing on plastic. EGF and FGF significantly increased cell proliferation on both substrates. FGF did not influence P production, while EGF clearly increased basal P production of the cells cultured on plastic. The high P production in cultured human granulosa cells obtained from follicles stimulated in vivo indicates that at least some of the cells were luteinized. The present data also demonstrate that EGF and FGF are mitogenic for human granulosa-luteal cells, and EGF regulates their biosynthesis in vitro. These results suggest that growth factors may also regulate granulosa cell function in vivo.\r"

The nuclear evolution of the oocyte is timed: prophase at 14 hours, germinal vesicle breakdown at 15 hours, metaphase I at 20 hours; metaphase II is complete by 35 hours. The quantified expansion of the cumulus is related to nuclear evolution. Almost complete expansion may already be observed 18 hours before ovulation (20 hours after hCG). The specific action of clomiphene citrate, human menopausal gonadotropin, and hCG stimulation on the granulosa induces a more rapid luteinization than is found after other means of stimulation or in spontaneous cycles. Oocytes from follicles less than or equal to 16 mm on preovulatory ovaries often show a reaction to hCG that may be related to their subsequent quality.\r"

All patients underwent ovulation induction using clomiphene citrate (CC) plus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). The numbers of oocytes recovered and embryos transferred were significantly lower in the LH surge group compared with the no surge-hCG group (P less than 0.05). Nevertheless, the pregnancy rate per oocyte recovery between the two groups appeared similar (20 versus 16%). Among the 30 patients with a LH surge, 9 received hCG after a LH surge was verified, whereas the others did not. Addition of hCG to the LH surge increased the numbers of oocytes recovered, embryos transferred, and the pregnancy rate (3 out of 9 versus 3 out of 21); however, this difference is not statistically significant. Furthermore, the addition of exogenous hCG to a spontaneous LH surge appears to be necessary to maximize the number of oocytes recovered, embryos transferred, and pregnancies obtained.\r"

These parameters plus luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were studied in experiments 2 and 3 with Long-Evans rats in untreated diabetic, control, insulin-treated diabetic, nondiabetic STZ-injected, and semistarved groups. Wistar diabetic rats had significantly decreased serum testosterone and increased blood glucose, BUN, and serum creatinine compared with controls. Several findings in Long-Evans rats suggested the existence of a primary Leydig cell defect in steroidogenesis during untreated diabetes that was completely or partially compensated for by increased pituitary gonadotropin secretion. Serum LH and FSH levels increased in Long-Evans diabetic rats. Serum testosterone was significantly reduced only in experiment 2. These hormonal alterations from control levels were not seen in insulin-treated diabetic animals. Semistarved animals, weight matched to the diabetic group in experiment 2, had significantly decreased serum testosterone and increased FSH levels. In addition, Long-Evans diabetic rat BUN and serum creatinine levels increased much less or were unchanged from control values compared with the increase noted in diabetic Wistar rats. In light of the hypogonadism that complicates clinical uremia, these findings suggest the more apt use of the Long-Evans strain rather than the Wistar strain in the study of STZ-D hypogonadal function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bicuculline (a GABAA receptor blocker), Ro 15-1788 (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist), or isopropylbicyclophosphate (a chloride channel blocker) consistently induced a transient but unequivocal decrease in the clinical severity of the encephalopathy and also corrected the abnormal pattern of the visual evoked response associated with hepatic encephalopathy. Rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy exhibited increased resistance to the convulsive effects of bicuculline. In encephalopathies induced in rabbits by gamma-vinyl-GABA (an inhibitor of GABA catabolism) or diazepam (a benzodiazepine receptor agonist), abnormalities of the visual evoked response similar to those found in hepatic encephalopathy occurred and were corrected by bicuculline and Ro 15-1788, respectively. These findings suggest that in hepatic encephalopathy due to fulminant hepatic failure (a) there is increased GABAergic tone, (b) an amelioration of encephalopathy can be induced by blockade of GABA or benzodiazepine receptors, (c) benzodiazepine receptor antagonists may be of clinical value in the management of hepatic encephalopathy, and (d) an endogenous substance with GABA potentiating properties may be present in hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Mutant rats with a selective defect for the hepatobiliary excretion of organic anions (GT+TR- rats) are valuable models to study hepatic transport processes. However, retained conjugates in the livers of these rats may secondarily affect hepatic uptake, metabolism, and excretion of other compounds and this may confound the interpretation of test results. We have developed double mutants (GT-TR-) rats with both a conjugation and an excretion defect by cross-breeding uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronyl-transferase-deficient GT-TR+ Gunn rats with transport-deficient GT+TR- rats. Phenotypically, GT-TR- rats and Gunn rats are alike in that both have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Intravenous administration of tetrabromosulphthalein, bilirubin diglucuronide, and bilirubin monoglucuronide revealed a significant difference in that the clearance of these compounds was reduced to 10%, 10%, and 20%, respectively, in GT-TR- rats when compared with Gunn rats. The hepatic elimination of tetrabromosulphthalein in GT-TR- rats and in GT+TR- rats is impaired to the same extent. Thus, both have a similar hepatic excretion defect. However, bile flow and bile acid excretion in GT+TR- rats are more depressed than in GT-TR- rats: bile flow, 88 +/- 3 vs. 36 +/- 1 microliters/min.kg and bile acid excretion, 3.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.1 mumol/min.kg in GT-TR- and GT+TR- rats, respectively. This suggests that accumulated glucuronides in the liver inhibit bile flow and bile acid excretion. To test whether conjugated bilirubin and the photoisomers of unconjugated bilirubin are excreted via the same transport pathways, the effect of phototherapy was studied in GT-TR- rats and in Gunn rats. Photoexposure caused a 120% increase in biliary excretion of bilirubin isomers in Gunn rats and only 40% in GT-TR- rats. This shows that the biliary excretion of bilirubin photoisomers is indeed affected by the hepatic excretion defect of GT-TR- rats and suggests that hepatic excretion of bilirubin photoisomers proceeds via the same route as other organic anions such as conjugated bilirubin and tetrabromosulphthalein.\r"

In order to study this clinically and economically important issue, we developed a mathematical model to analyze the economics of endoscopic therapy of bleeding peptic ulcers. Endoscopic therapy appears capable of reducing direct hospital costs only when selectively applied to those patients with the highest risk of requiring surgery. Sensitivity analysis identifies efficacy, treatment cost, and the rebleeding rate in untreated patients as the most critical variables affecting the cost of interventional endoscopy. Using neodymium: YAG laser photocoagulation as an example, interventional endoscopy can be cost-effective for treating selected patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. Should other hemostatic devices such as the heater probe and bipolar electrocoagulator prove to be as effective as the laser, even greater cost savings could be achieved.\r"

By the generation of plasmin, plasminogen activators may play an important role in regulating the extracellular protease activity required for this event to occur. The production of biofunctional urokinase and of tissue plasminogen activator was therefore investigated in the dimethylhydrazine induced rat model of colorectal neoplasia. Both adenomatous polyps (p values less than 0.001) and colorectal carcinomas (p values less than 0.001) were demonstrated to produce a significant excess of both urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator when compared with macroscopically normal colon. There was, however, no increased production of either enzyme by macroscopically normal preneoplastic colon when compared with control colon. This enhanced capacity of colorectal tumours to produce plasminogen activators and generate plasmin is thus a feature of both the premalignant as well as the malignant phenotype. These enzymes may contribute to the malignant potential of adenomatous polyps and to the invasive capacity of established carcinomas.\r"

To determine one possible mechanism for this we compared the effects of auranofin and myochrysine on intestinal water and solute transport in the rat. Jejunal perfusion with 2 mM auranofin (n = 5) induced fluid and electrolyte secretion and inhibited glucose absorption (p less than 0.01). Auranofin (0.2 mM) induced fluid secretion in the jejunum (n = 5; p less than 0.01) and colon (n = 6; p less than 0.01). In contrast, 2 mM myochrysine enhanced jejunal water and electrolyte absorption (n = 6; p less than 0.02). Both compounds enhanced absorption of mannitol (p less than 0.01). Perfusion of 0.2 mM auranofin for two hours had no significant effect on mucosal c-AMP levels (n = 4). After perfusion for two hours with 2 mM auranofin the jejunal mucosa showed severe injury by light and scanning electronmicroscopy while myochrysine had no apparent effect. The damage after perfusion with 0.2 mM auranofin for two hours was less severe. Auranofin was more rapidly absorbed than myochrysine (p less than 0.05). These effects provide an explanation for the diarrhoea associated with auranofin therapy.\r"

In order to determine the effect of nitroglycerin on portal venous hemodynamics, we studied 11 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis before and during the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 and 0.6 mg). The hepatic venous pressure gradient (which was obtained by subtracting the free hepatic venous pressure from the wedged hepatic venous pressure) decreased from 17.9 +/- 6.5 mm Hg (mean +/- S.D.) to 15.1 +/- 5.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.02) at the peak of the effect, which occurred from 2 to 12 min after nitroglycerin administration. The mean arterial pressure was reduced from 96 +/- 10 mm Hg to a peak decrease of 76 +/- 18 mmHg (p less than 0.001). The peak change in the hepatic venous pressure gradient induced by nitroglycerin correlated directly with the peak change in mean arterial pressure (r = 0.79, p less than 0.01). There was a moderate increase in heart rate in response to the decrease in blood pressure (73 +/- 15 to 83 +/- 15 beats per min, p less than 0.001). Two of the 11 patients did not reduce their hepatic venous pressure gradient after 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. Reductions in portal pressure were observed with both increases and moderate decreases in azygos blood flow, suggesting that, as observed in experimental animals, the portal-pressure-reducing effect of nitroglycerin could be due to two different and independent mechanisms, a reduction in portal blood flow or portal-collateral vasodilatation.\r"

In order to study this process in more detail, we produced liver injury in hamsters using increasing doses of acetaminophen, with serial collection of sera for up to 168 hr after acetaminophen injection. Hamster Gc was purified using a three-step procedure and was shown to resemble closely human Gc. Polyclonal antihamster Gc was prepared and used in rocket immunoelectrophoresis and radial immunodiffusion studies for quantitation of total serum Gc and the percentage of Gc complexed with actin. Serum Gc levels were depressed in animals having liver damage, and the extent of depression 42 hr after acetaminophen correlated with the extent of elevation of AST. The proportion of the total Gc that was present in the complexed form increased in relation to the severity of the liver disease. In serial studies, diminution in Gc level preceded the rise in AST and increase in the percent complexed. These changes closely resemble observations in man and suggest that the hamster-acetaminophen hepatotoxicity model may be of value in further study of interactions of Gc with intracellular actin components and its role in actin homeostasis in conditions of massive tissue necrosis.\r"

Animals were killed 90 min after intragastric administration of diets with or without ethanol. Alcohol feeding markedly increased liver triglycerides, with a modest rise in nonesterified fatty acids. Alcohol-fed rats developed hepatomegaly, with a 48% increase in hepatic cytosolic proteins. Fatty acid binding was first assessed by the kinetics of [14C]palmitate binding to cytosolic proteins. The maximal binding capacity more than doubled in the cytosol of the ethanol-fed rats compared to pair-fed controls, whereas the dissociation constant increased by 64%. Acute ethanol administration (3 gm per kg body weight) either to ethanol-fed or control rats did not have a significant effect. To identify the fatty acid-binding protein, labeled cytosolic proteins were fractionated by gel filtration: most of the cytosolic fatty acids eluted as a single peak in the 12,000 to 18,000 molecular weight region corresponding to the hepatic fatty acid-binding protein. The increase in this protein, confirmed by radial immunodiffusion (27.0 +/- 1.4 mg per 100 gm body weight vs. 11.2 +/- 1.6, in controls; p less than 0.01), accounted for 22% of the total rise in cytosolic protein induced by chronic ethanol feeding.\r"

The xenobiotic p-nitrophenol was glucuronidated with a comparable rate in microsomes from human hepatoma, human liver and host liver. With regard to glucuronic acid or glucose conjugation of the endogenous compounds of bile acids, bilirubin and steroid hormones, glucosidation of bile acids was the only conjugation mechanism that was not decreased or deficient in microsomes from hepatoma, but showed about a 2-fold increase in reaction rate compared to normal human liver. Human hepatoma and host liver were shown to respond to phenobarbital treatment which led to about a 2-fold increase in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity toward bilirubin in hepatoma and in host liver. Compared to normal tissues, alterations in the pattern of glycoside conjugating enzymes were not only observed in microsomes from human hepatoma, but also in microsomes from human adenocarcinoma of the kidney, exhibiting negligible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities toward bile acids and steroid hormones. Bile acid glucoside formation was measurable in kidney adenocarcinoma with an activity which was similar to the activity observed in hepatoma. In comparison to normal renal tissue, glucose-conjugating activity toward bile acids decreased about 2-fold in kidney adenocarcinoma.\r"

PAF caused a dose-dependent increase in vascular permeability. At 1 ng/kg iv, PAF caused an increase in Evans blue extravasation of 220% (P less than 0.05) in the trachea, with the greatest effect at a dose of 100 ng/kg (858%; P less than 0.01). Histamine (150 micrograms/kg iv) caused a 320% increase over base line in the trachea and 200% in main bronchi; this effect was equivalent to that induced by 10 ng/kg PAF in the trachea and 1 ng/kg in main bronchi. The duration of effect of PAF was greatest in main bronchi (less than 10 min). Platelet depletion with a cytotoxic antibody, or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, or the cyclooxygenase-lipoxygenase inhibitor, BW 7556, did not affect the vascular permeability response to PAF. The PAF-receptor antagonist, BN 52063, inhibited Evans blue extravasation in the airways in a dose-dependent manner, with complete inhibition at 5 mg/kg. Thus PAF-induced airway vascular leakage is mediated by specific receptors but not by products of arachidonic acid metabolism or by platelets. Increased airway microvascular leakage induced by PAF may lead to plasma extravasation and airway edema, factors that may contribute to the airway narrowing and hyperresponsiveness induced by PAF.\r"

We studied the response of the peripheral lung to hypocapnia in anesthetized, paralyzed, mechanically ventilated dogs using the wedged bronchoscope technique to measure resistance of the collateral system (Rcs). A 5-min hypocapnic challenge produced a 161 +/- 19% (mean +/- SE) increase in Rcs. The magnitude of this response was not diminished with repeated challenge or by atropine sulfate (1 mg base/kg iv), chlorpheniramine maleate (5 mg base/kg iv), or indomethacin (5 mg/kg iv). The response was reduced by 75% by isoproterenol (5 micrograms/kg iv) (P less than 0.01) and reduced by 80% by nifedipine (20 micrograms/kg iv) (P less than 0.05). During 30-min exposure to hypocapnia the maximum constrictor response occurred at 4-5 min, after which the response attenuated to approximately 50% of the maximum response (mean = 53%, range 34-69%). Further 30-min challenges with hypocapnia resulted in significantly decreased peak responses, the third response being 50% of the first (P less than 0.001). The inability of indomethacin or propranolol to affect the tachyphylaxis or attenuation of the response suggests that neither cyclooxygenase products nor beta-adrenergic activity was involved. Hence, hypocapnia caused a prompt and marked constrictor response in the peripheral lung not associated with cholinergic mechanisms or those involving histamine H1-receptors or prostaglandins. With prolonged exposure to hypocapnia there was gradual attentuation of the constrictor response with continued exposure and tachyphylaxis to repeated exposure both of which would tend to diminish any compensatory effect of hypocapnic airway constriction on the distribution of ventilation.\r"

Cardiac arrest by ventricular fibrillation was associated with a mean decrease in alveolar ventilation of 43% in five dogs on right and left heart bypass. However, successful defibrillation and return of the prearrest level of alveolar ventilation could not be achieved; thus we studied six dogs on left heart bypass. Alveolar ventilation decreased an average of 37% with cardiac arrest, and defibrillation resulted in a return of alveolar ventilation to 81% of the prearrest value. These results are consistent with previous predictions that cardiogenic oscillations are an important mechanism of gas transport during constant-flow ventilation.\r"

Samples were obtained by venipuncture with subjects seated. No significant differences in resting plasma osmolality (Osm), sodium, potassium, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), aldosterone, renin activity, or atrial natriuretic factor were found between groups. Maximal exercise produced significant increases in all of the above variables. Values immediately postexercise were similar between groups except for plasma Osm and sodium, which were significantly higher in the untrained group. Despite a reduction in plasma volume of equal magnitude in both groups, trained subjects demonstrated an increase in vascular proteins and mean corpuscular volume during exercise. This increase in plasma protein may be an important initiating factor responsible for the elevated plasma volume after 1-h recovery from exercise in the trained group. Lastly, similar ADH responses despite lower Osm in trained subjects may indicate that training increases the sensitivity of ADH to osmotic stimulation.\r"

The immediate ventilatory (VE) drop in response to five breaths of pure O2 was measured at 3, 7, and 15 min during hypoxia. Each lamb was studied again at 10-11 days of age. At 2-3 days of age VE increased, with the onset of hypoxia, from 658 +/- 133 (SD) ml.min-1 X kg-1 to a peak of 1,124 +/- 177 ml.min-1 X kg-1. A dampening of the VE response then occurred, with a mean decline in VE of 319 ml.min-1 X kg-1 over the 18-min hypoxia period. Each pure O2 test (Dejours test) resulted in an abrupt fall in VE (delta VEDejours). This VE drop was 937 +/- 163, 868 +/- 244, and 707 +/- 120 ml.min-1 X kg-1 at 3, 7, and 15 min of hypoxia, respectively. Comparing the three O2 tests, delta VEDejours was significantly decreased by 15 min, indicating a loss of about one-fourth of the O2 chemoreflex drive during hypoxia. Testing at 10-11 days of age revealed a smaller VE decline during hypoxia. O2 tests at the beginning and end of the hypoxic period were not significantly different, indicating a smaller loss of hypoxic chemoreflex drive in the more mature animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hindlimb vascular bed pressure-flow relationships were evaluated in seven conscious dogs using a newly developed controlled-flow perfusion technique. For controlled-flow perfusion, blood was diverted from a common carotid artery to a roller pump for perfusion of the left hindlimb vascular bed via an artificial vascular graft anastomosed to the left external iliac artery. An occlusion cuff positioned around the external iliac artery proximal to the graft arrested normal hindlimb blood flow during perfusion. Collateral flow was minimized by ligating all other major arteries supplying the left hindlimb. Hindlimb perfusion pressure, measured via the left deep femoral artery, decreased to a plateau value of 19.7 +/- 3.4 mmHg when pump flow was zero. Pressure-flow relationships were evaluated while the dogs were at rest by changing flow in small \"square-wave\" steps for 3 min each and measuring the steady-state perfusion pressure at each step. The hindlimb was perfused over a wide range of flows (25-450 ml/min) that resulted in perfusion pressures ranging from 40 to 175 mmHg. The hindlimb pressure-flow relationship obtained was indicative of net passive vascular behavior. That is, resistance to flow decreased with increases in flow, such that a curvilinear pressure-flow relationship occurred that was convex to the pressure axis. We conclude that the hindlimb circulation of resting conscious dogs can be perfused using controlled-flow perfusion techniques. These techniques can also be applied to other vascular beds and should be useful for evaluating peripheral vascular responses to drugs and reflexogenic alterations.\r"

If the pulmonary hypertension extends to the level of the microvasculature, then the increased microvascular pressure may contribute to the pulmonary edema caused by endotoxin. We tested the hypothesis that reducing the pulmonary hypertension would reduce the amount of edema caused by endotoxin. Twelve sheep were chronically instrumented with catheters to measure PAP, left atrial pressure, and central venous pressure. The sheep were divided into two groups. One group (E) of six sheep received an intravenous infusion of 4 micrograms/kg of E. coli endotoxin. The second group (E + SNP) received the same dose of endotoxin as well as a continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to reduce PAP. Three hours after the endotoxin infusions, the sheep were terminated and the extravascular fluid-to-blood-free dry weight ratios of the lungs were determined (EVF). The base-line PAP was 17.5 +/- 2.7 mmHg. A two-way analysis of variance demonstrated a significant difference (P less than 0.01) in PAP between the E and E + SNP groups. Although PAP in each group varied as a function of time, the difference between the two groups did not. The mean PAP for the E + SNP group (20.9 +/- 1.5 mmHg) was lower than the E group PAP of 27.3 +/- 2.1 mmHg after the endotoxin spike. Furthermore, the E + SNP group EVF (3.9 +/- 0.2) was significantly less than the EVF of the E group (4.7 +/- 0.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After right trilobectomy, left lung dry weight was normal at 4 days, increased 74% between 4 and 7 days, and more slowly over the next week. Total glycosaminoglycan content per milligram dry lung weight increased early and rapidly, reaching 189% of the control value at 4 days postresection. The magnitude and temporal pattern of increase was different for different glycosaminoglycan subtypes. Hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate content were increased by 198 and 113%, respectively, at 4 days, with no further increases subsequently. Heparan sulfate content increased more slowly and steadily, and dermatan sulfate concentrations did not change. At 4 days, the percent of total glycosaminoglycans that was hyaluronate was almost doubled, whereas the percent that was heparan sulfate was decreased; by day 7 the percent compositions had returned to normal. We conclude that changes in glycosaminoglycans occur early in postresectional lung growth and speculate that they may play a facilitatory role.\r"

J. Physiol. 250 (Regulatory Integrative Comp. Physiol. 19): R691-R698, 1986]. Sephadex G-200 chromatography of SS but not that of CS showed a single peak of Leu-NA hydrolytic activity (at pH 8) at 350,000 mol wt. An enzyme with similar molecular weight was eluted from tape-stripped stratum corneum and from stripped skin in situ. Anion-exchange FPLC of the 350,000 fractions yielded a single Leu-NA hydrolase peak at pH 8 (pool IV), which also showed hydrolytic activity for benzoyl-L-arginine-2-naphthylamide (BANA). Both Leu-NA and BANA hydrolytic activities of pool IV were thiol dependent, inhibited by heavy metals, and activated by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The pool IV enzyme also hydrolyzed L-lysine- and L-arginine-2-naphthylamide. The most prominent BANA hydrolase activity was seen in both SS and CS at pH 5.0 at 33,000, which was not associated with Leu-NA hydrolytic activity. Diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography of the 33,000 fractions yielded three peaks of BANA hydrolytic activity in SS but only one in CS, suggesting that this thiol-dependent BANA hydrolyzing enzyme in CS may be of sweat gland origin. We conclude that the 350,000 thiol-dependent Leu-NA-hydrolyzing aminopeptidase is one of the most prominent epidermal contaminants and thus is a useful marker of epidermal contamination in sweat samples.\r"

We inflated the lungs to a constant airway pressure of 7 cmH2O, and at constant blood flow, we maintained outflow pressure in the circulation greater than airway pressure at the level of micropuncture (zone 3). By the use of glass micropipettes and a servo-nulling device, we measured pressures in small (20-60 micron diam) subpleural arterioles and venules in the lungs of 13 newborn rabbits. We found that 60% of the pressure drop was in arteries, 31% in microvessels of less than 20-60 micron diam, and 9% in veins. In the lungs of an additional nine rabbit pups we measured microvascular pressures before and after the addition to the perfusate of the vasodilator, papaverine hydrochloride. We found that removal of vasomotor tone resulted in a 33% reduction in total lung vascular resistance, which resulted from a decrease in pressure in arterial vessels, with no change in microvascular pressure. These findings indicate that arteries of greater than 60 micron diam constitute the major source of vascular resistance in isolated perfused newborn rabbit lungs.\r"

By use of an open-chest preparation the left lower lobe (LLL) pulmonary circulation was isolated, continuously weighed, and perfused in situ. The anastomotic bronchial blood flow [Qbr(s-p)] was measured as the rate of increase in the volume of the LLL-perfusion circuit. Four groups of dogs were studied. In group A, six dogs received cyclooxygenase inhibition (COI) with either indomethacin (2 mg/kg) or ibuprofen (10 mg/kg). In group B (n = 10) lung injury caused by airway instillation of glucose (15 mg) with glucose oxidase (500 micrograms/kg) (G/GO) or LLL pulmonary arterial infusion of alpha-napthyl thiourea (ANTU, 2 mg/kg). Group C (n = 10) received COI, and 30 min later injury was induced as above with either ANTU or G/GO. Group D (n = 4) received COI immediately after anesthesia; then, 30 min after completion of the surgical preparation, injury was induced with ANTU or G/GO. After COI, Qbr(s-p) decreased to 35 +/- 9% of the basal values (P less than 0.05). After administration of ANTU or G/GO, Qbr(s-p) increased irrespective of whether COI was present. 6-Ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) were measured by radioimmunoassay in the LLL pulmonary artery and systemic venous blood, demonstrating an increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha due to surgical preparation and confirming complete COI in those animals receiving COI immediately after anesthesia. These findings demonstrate that 1) the bronchial circulation is capable of a sevenfold increase in flow in response to acute lung injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ventilatory response to progressive isocapnic hypoxia [arterial O2 partial pressure 155.9 +/- 4.0 (SE) to 46.7 +/- 1.5 Torr] was expressed as change in minute ventilation per change in arterial O2 saturation and varied from -0.16 to -1.88 [0.67 +/- 0.19 (SE)] l/min per % among subjects. In the meanwhile, jugular venous PCO2 (PjCO2) decreased significantly from 51.0 +/- 1.1 to 47.3 +/- 1.0 Torr (P less than 0.01), probably due to the increase in brain blood flow, and stayed at the same level during 15 min of sustained hypoxia. Based on the assumption that PjCO2 reflects the brain tissue PCO2, we evaluated the depressant effect of fall in PjCO2 on hypoxic ventilatory response, using a slope for ventilation-PjCO2 line which was determined in the second set of experiments. Hypoxic ventilatory response corrected with this factor was -1.31 +/- 0.33 l/min per %, indicating that this factor modulated hypoxic ventilatory response in humans. The ventilatory response to progressive isocapnic hypoxia did not correlate with this factor but significantly correlated with the withdrawal test (modified transient O2 test), which was performed on a separate day. Accordingly we conclude that an increase in brain blood flow during exposure to moderate hypoxia may substantially attenuate the ventilatory response but that it is unlikely to be the major factor of the interindividual variation of progressive isocapnic hypoxic ventilatory response in humans.\r"

Rats who were in contact with water but without the energy expenditure due to exercise (paddlers) had their vaginal opening in a middle point between control and exercising rats. Vaginal opening occurred at different ages but at a same body weight. Exercise and stress led to a marked decrease of the body weights between 19 and 40 days of age. Serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were increased with the exercise program at 30 days of age, whereas no significant differences between groups in serum gonadotropins were observed at 50 days of age. Only the anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone content was increased by exercise in adult rats. Total ovarian proteins were significantly reduced by stress and to a greater degree by exercise. Ovarian inhibin activity is not modified by exercise at 30 days of age, whereas it increased significantly in the exercising group at 50 days of age and to a lesser degree in paddlers. It is therefore suggested that the onset of puberty in rats is dependent on a critical weight and that exercise and stress can delay the onset of puberty. This delay could be explained by a deficiency of hormonal maturational process while exercising until sexual maturity alters the inhibin activity, which suggests that inhibin could play a major role for the normal reproductive function and this could possibly explain the menstrual disturbances in the female athlete.\r"

Six horses performed standard treadmill exercise tests consisting of a 2-min warm up followed by galloping 1 min each at 8,9, and 10 m/s. Each horse exercised six times while wearing each of the four respiratory masks. Each flow-through system was used twice with flow rates of 2,360 and 3,840 l/min for one system, and 3,840 and 6,300 l/min for the other. Arterial blood gas tensions were measured during exercise at each speed for each system and were compared with values measured when the horses performed the same test without wearing a mask. Hypercapnia developed during exercise with each of the respiratory masks except with the 6,300-l/min flow-through system. All horses became hypoxemic during every exercise test, but it was most severe when systems incorporating one-way valves were used. This, plus the degree of hypercapnia observed and a suboptimal heart rate-O2 uptake relationship, indicated that such systems severely impede ventilation and suggest that experiments performed while utilizing them do not represent the normal exercise condition.\r"

To investigate the role of the coagulation cascade and its inhibitors in these disorders, venous blood was obtained from eight subjects who participated in the Operation Everest II project. Samples were obtained before and 5 min after completion of a progressive incremental exercise test to exhaustion at sea level and atmospheric pressures of 380 (18,000 ft) and 282 Torr (25,000 ft). Plasma was analyzed for the activity or concentration of factors II, V, VII, VIII complex, IX-XIII, prekallikrein, high-molecular-weight kininogen, fibrinogen, antithrombin III, alpha 2-macroglobulin, alpha 2-antiplasmin, C1-esterase inhibitor, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and protein C. Prolonged exposure to simulated high altitude did not alter the concentration of any of the coagulation factors or inhibitors. Exercise increased the circulating concentrations of the factor VIII complex at sea level, 380, and 282 Torr. However, the increment was less at the simulated high altitudes. The increase in the factor VIII complex was inversely related to arterial O2 saturation and directly related to the work load achieved and blood pH and plasma lactate concentrations. These studies suggest that the gradual development of marked chronic hypoxia does not affect the coagulation cascade.\r"

An IBM PC/AT-based breath-by-breath system was developed, with turbine flowmeter and dual-Fleisch pneumotachometers connected in series. A normal subject was tested twice at rest, 100-W, and 175-W of exercise. Expired gas of 24-32 breaths was collected in a Douglas bag. VE was within 4% accuracy for both flowmeter systems. The Fleisch pneumotachometer system had 5% accuracy for VO2 and VCO2 at rest and exercise. The turbine flowmeter system had up to 20% error for VO2 and VCO2 at rest. Errors decreased as work load increased. Visual observations of the flow curves revealed the turbine signal always lagged the Fleisch signal at the beginning of inspiration or expiration. At the end of inspiration or expiration, the turbine signal continued after the Fleisch signal had returned to zero. The \"lag-before-start\" and \"spin-after-stop\" effects of the turbine flowmeter resulted in larger than acceptable error for the VO2 and VCO2 measurements at low flow rates.\r"

The method utilizes the prompt nuclear reaction 18O(p, alpha o)15N, and 846-keV protons from a 3-MeV Van de Graaff Accelerator are focused on approximately 2,000-A-thick Ta2O5 targets prepared by anodic oxidation from 50-microliter samples of water distilled from blood or other biological fluids. The broad cross section of the resonance peak for this nuclear reaction (47 keV) ensures high yields, especially at small reaction angles, and the high-energy alpha particles produced by the reaction (4 MeV) are readily separated from scattered protons by the use of an aluminized Mylar foil of suitable thickness. Background levels of 18O (0.204 atom%) can be detected with run times of approximately 5-8 min, and the sensitivity of the method is of the order of 0.05 atom %. Experimental error due to sample preparation was found to be 1.7%, and counting errors were close to theoretical limits so that total error was of the order of 2.5%. Duplicate samples were analyzed by use of the 18O(p, alpha o)15N reaction at Lucas Heights, Australia, and the 18O(p,n)18F reaction by the method of Wood et al. (Anal. Chem. 47: 646-650, 1975) at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the agreement was excellent (y = 1.0123x - 0.0123, r = 0.991, P less than 0.001). The theoretical limitations and the general applicability of the method in biological studies designed to estimate the rate of metabolism of free-ranging animals are discussed.\r"

We studied the effects of 48 h of pulmonary arterial occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion in 18 awake dogs. Because of evidence in other organ systems of O2 radical generation, during reperfusion, nine of the animals were randomly assigned to receive allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and vitamin E, an antioxidant. Reperfusion resulted in marked edema and inflammatory infiltrates in the reperfused lung but also caused mild edema and inflammation in the contralateral continuously perfused lung. Electron microscopy demonstrated lysis of both capillary endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells bilaterally, with the frequency of cell injury greater on the reperfused side. During reperfusion, body temperatures rose dramatically from 39.4 +/- 0.1 to 40.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C (P less than 0.05) and marked leukopenia developed. There were no differences in any hemodynamic, gas exchange, or morphometric measurements between allopurinol-treated dogs and untreated animals. We conclude that reperfusion causes local and distant injury which does not appear to be mediated by xanthine oxidase-produced O2 radicals.\r"

Over the entire range of Q studied, 2-5 l.min-1.m-2, hypoxia increased PAP in 16 dogs (\"responders\") and did not affect PAP in 16 other dogs (\"nonresponders\"). A hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) was restored in the nonresponders by intravenous administration of 1 g of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Nitroprusside (5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) inhibited HPV in responders (n = 8) and nonresponders treated with ASA (n = 8). End-tidal 1.41% isoflurane (a minimal alveolar concentration equal to one for dogs) did not affect HPV in responders (n = 8) and nonresponders treated with ASA (n = 8). In the latter group isoflurane increased PAP at the highest Q studied (3-5 l.min-1.m-2) in hyperoxia and hypoxia. In a final group of eight dogs with Q kept constant, PAP remained unchanged during two consecutive sequences of alternated 30-min periods (maximum time to generate a PAP/Q plot) successively at FIO2 0.4 and 0.1, and the hypoxia-induced increase in PAP was reproducible. Thus the present experimental model appeared suitable for the study of the effects of hypoxia and drugs on pulmonary vascular tone of intact dogs. At the given doses HPV was inhibited by nitroprusside and not affected by isoflurane. Products of arachidonic acid metabolism possibly could be implicated in the pulmonary vascular effects of isoflurane.\r"

Flow cytometric measurements of DNA were used to determine the percentage of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Mitotic index was designated as the percentage of granulosa cells in S + G2/M. The progesterone concentration and the progesterone to estradiol ratio in follicular fluids were inversely correlated to mitotic index (r = -0.506; P less than 0.001, and r = -0.320; P less than 0.02, respectively). Estradiol and androstenedione levels did not correlate with the mitotic index. The mitotic index was higher in follicles with immature oocytes [25.6 +/- 2.0% (+/- SE); n = 7] than in follicles with mature oocytes (15.6 +/- 1.2%; n = 41; P less than 0.001). The mitotic index of granulosa cells was lowest in follicles with oocytes that fertilized (15.5 +/- 1.8%), higher in follicles with oocytes that remained unfertilized (18.5 +/- 1.3%; P less than 0.03), and highest in follicles with oocytes that fertilized abnormally (24.0 +/- 2.1%; P less than 0.02). Differences in maturity or fertilizability of oocytes were not associated with variations in follicular fluid progesterone concentrations. The study supports the concept that mitotic activity is decreased when granulosa cells become luteinized. During early follicular growth it is assumed that estradiol and perhaps androstenedione may be important regulators of cell division. Our findings suggest that progesterone, perhaps acting as an antiestradiol, is more important in controlling granulosa cell division of preovulatory follicles during the late follicular phase.\r"

A three-pool model with rapidly and slowly equilibrating pools exchanging with serum was used to evaluate the potential sites of alterations. Healthy euthyroid subjects with low serum T4-binding globulin levels had increased serum percent free fraction of T4 (%FFT4) and fractional T4 transfer rates (FTR) from serum to both extravascular pools, while those with high serum T4-binding capacity had decreased %FFT4 and FTR from serum to the rapid pool and increased T4 binding in the slow pool. Critically ill patients had significantly reduced serum total T4 (TT4) with increased %FFT4 but decreased FTR from serum to both extravascular pools and reduced T4 binding in the slow pool. Patients with ethanol abuse had normal serum TT4 and %FFT4 but significantly increased FTR from serum to the rapid pool and increased binding in both extravascular pools. Chronic renal failure patients had no alterations in any of these values. The T4 FTR from serum to both extravascular pools were directly related to the serum %FFT4 in healthy subjects and inversely related in the patients. Further, the FTR from the rapid pool to serum were inversely related to rapid pool binding in healthy subjects but not in the patients, while the FTR from the slow pool to serum were unrelated to slow pool binding in both groups. These findings indicate that in patients with nonthyroidal illnesses the transfer of T4 between serum and the extravascular pools is not primarily a reflection of T4 binding to serum binding proteins or extravascular sites. Further, alterations in slow pool binding may be affected by changes in T4 binding to serum binding proteins, which are known to be present in the interstitial fluid of these tissues. Finally, the type and magnitude of the alterations in T4 transfer and distribution in patients with nonthyroidal illnesses appear to differ for rapidly and slowly equilibrating tissues and may be related to the etiology and/or severity of the nonthyroidal disorder.\r"

Compared to normal men, serum bio-FSH and immuno-FSH levels were elevated in patients with idiopathic azoospermia associated with severe germinal epithelium damage; the bioactive to immunoreactive ratio (B:I ratio) of FSH in these men [mean, 1.5 +/- 0.5 (+/- SD)] was significantly lower than that in fertile men (2.7 +/- 0.8). Similarly, in men with moderate and severe oligospermia, the B:I ratios of FSH were decreased (1.4 +/- 0.4 and 1.7 +/- 0.3, respectively). Although serum immuno-FSH levels correlated weakly with mean sperm concentrations in the normal and oligospermic men (r = -0.35), no relationship was found between serum bio-FSH and sperm concentrations. The B:I ratio of FSH correlated weakly with sperm concentration (r = 0.46). These findings suggest that the B:I ratio of FSH measured by the GAB assay decreases in patients with low sperm concentrations and germinal cell failure.\r"

To gain further insight into the mechanism by which FFA exert their effect, we studied the plasma GH responses to GHRH-(1-44) (1 microgram/kg, iv) in normal subjects in whom plasma FFA levels were raised by a lipid-heparin infusion (250 mL 10% Intralipid plus 2500 U heparin). Paired tests were performed in 10 normal subjects, with and without lipid-heparin pretreatment. Lipid-heparin infusion from -30 to 120 min increased mean FFA levels from 0.41 +/- 0.03 (+/- SEM) to 3.12 +/- 0.40 mmol/L at 120 min. The mean plasma GH levels after GHRH administration were lower at all times; however, the values were significantly different (P less than 0.05) only at the later times (45, 60, and 90 min). When considered individually, an all or none pattern was observed; 5 subjects had no plasma GH response to GHRH, and 5 had no reduction. To investigate the time relationships between the FFA peak and subsequent GH blockade, a different protocol of paired tests was performed with GHRH with or without a different lipid-heparin infusion protocol. Lipid-heparin was infused from -90 to 0 min, with an additional heparin pulse at -15 min, to obtain a higher and earlier (0 min) FFA increase. FFA increased from 1.06 +/- 0.19 to 11.61 +/- 0.83 mmol/L at zero time. The GHRH-induced GH secretory peak (15.8 +/- 3.5 ng/ml) at 15 min was completely blocked (0.9 +/- 0.2 ng/ml), and the mean plasma GH levels were also lower at 30, 45, and 60 min. To determine whether the FFA-induced blockade of GH secretion was exerted in the pituitary, a series of in vitro studies was conducted using monolayer cultures of rat anterior pituitary glands, with GHRH concentrations of both 10(-10) and 10(-8) M and 10(-5) M forskolin to stimulate GH release. Both caprylic and oleic acid inhibited basal GH release and GHRH- or forskolin-induced GH release. PRL release was not altered, nor were toxic actions noted on the cells. In conclusion, FFA are able to block GH secretion directly at the pituitary level.\r"

  ".W": "The precise patterns of LH, FSH, and PRL secretion and their correlation with estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) secretion during the entire luteal phase have not been elucidated. To analyze in detail the secretory patterns of these hormones we performed 29 consecutive studies in 5 healthy, regularly menstruating women throughout their luteal phase [days 0 (ovulation), 2, 6, 10, and 14] and subsequent early follicular phase (day 2F). During each study plasma LH, FSH, PRL, E2, and P were measured at 10-min intervals for 6 h. Both plasma LH concentrations and LH pulse frequency declined from days 0 to 10 and increased thereafter, whereas LH pulse amplitude continued to decline throughout the luteal and early follicular phases. Plasma FSH concentrations followed a pattern similar to that of LH; however, there was a larger increase in the FSH level on days 14 and 2F. Plasma PRL levels declined initially on day 2 and again on day 14. Regression analysis indicated a positive correlation between LH concentrations and LH pulse frequency (r = 0.715; P less than 0.001) and between PRL and E2 concentrations (r = 0.528; P less than 0.01). A negative correlation was found between plasma P concentrations and both LH concentrations (r = -0.521; P less than 0.01) and LH pulse frequency (r = -0.633; P less than 0.001) and between plasma E2 and FSH concentrations (r = -0.762; P less than 0.001). Thirty-six (65%) PRL pulses and only 11 (39%) FSH pulses coincided with LH pulses. There was no clear pulsatile pattern of secretion of either E2 or P. We conclude that 1) the plasma LH, FSH, PRL, E2, and P concentrations vary markedly throughout the luteal phase; 2) the plasma LH level is largely dependent on the frequency of LH pulses; 3) plasma P decreases plasma LH by reducing the frequency of LH pulses; 4) the remarkable synchrony between PRL pulses and LH pulses implies that their secretion may be regulated by a common neuroendocrine mechanism; and 5) the preferential increase in FSH during the late luteal phase may play an important role in follicular recruitment for the subsequent cycle.\r"

  ".U": "88008216\r", 
  ".W": "Hyperestrogenemic states, including pregnancy, cause an increase in serum T4-binding globulin (TBG) concentrations and an increase in the proportion of TBG molecules with greater anodal mobility on isoelectric focusing, indicating greater sialic acid content. The possible causal relationship between the degree of sialylation and accumulation of TBG in serum was explored by measuring the in vivo half-lives (t1/2) of TBGs with different isoelectric points. TBG in unfractionated serum and its major peaks, isolated by chromatofocusing and defined by their isoelectric points on isoelectric focusing were each injected iv into rats. The resulting TBG concentrations, measured by specific RIA in serum samples obtained at intervals after injection, were used for the calculation of the t1/2. TBG in serum from a pregnant woman had a significantly longer t1/2 of 17.2 +/- 1.2 h (mean +/- SD) compared to those of 13.3 +/- 1.5 and 12.9 +/- 0.9 h for TBG in serum from a man and a nonpregnant woman, respectively. TBG peaks II, III, IV, and V, with increasing anodal mobility, had progressively longer t1/2 values of 11, 13, 15, and 33 h, respectively. However, TBG peaks of the same mobility on IEF isolated from serum of pregnant or nonpregnant subjects had similar t1/2 values. Neither the TBG concentration nor estrogen had a direct effect on the rate of TBG clearance. Indeed, the t1/2 of TBG from a subject with inherited TBG excess was not different from that of TBG from a nonpregnant woman or a man. Chronic treatment of rats with estradiol did not alter the rate of clearance of injected human TBG. Finally, the more heavily sialylated anodal bands of purified but unfractionated serum TBG, analyzed by Western blots, survived longer in the circulation of a rat. These results indicate that the rate of in vivo metabolism of TBG is dependent on its sialic acid content. The increased proportion of TBG molecules with higher sialic acid content thus contributes to the increase in the serum TBG concentration in hyperestrogenemic states.\r"

  ".W": "Large doses of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) inhibit renin and aldosterone secretion in normal man, but the effect of physiological levels is unknown. We, therefore, studied the effect of a low infusion rate of alpha-human ANP (alpha hANP; 0.5 microgram/min for 180 min) on the plasma corticosteroid response to graded physiological doses of angiotensin II (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 ng/kg X min, each for 30 min) and ACTH (6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 mIU, each for 30 min) in six normal men eating a low salt diet (10 mmol sodium and 100 mmol potassium daily). The angiotensin II and ACTH infusions were given from 0900-1100 h on separate days, during which randomized infusions of placebo or alpha hANP were given from 0800-1100 h according to a single blind protocol. Plasma immunoreactive ANP levels were less than 10 pmol/L on the placebo day compared to 30-50 pmol/L during the alpha hANP infusions, and were not altered by either ACTH or angiotensin II. Compared with the control observations, there was no significant change in arterial pressure or heart rate during either the alpha hANP or angiotensin II infusions. ACTH infusions evoked an incremental response in plasma aldosterone and cortisol, and the dose-response relationship was unaltered by alpha hANP. In contrast, while an incremental and significant increase in plasma aldosterone in response to angiotensin II occurred with the placebo infusion, no significant increase occurred in response to angiotensin during the alpha hANP infusion. The slope of the angiotensin II/aldosterone regression line was significantly less during all alpha hANP infusions compared to that during the placebo infusion (P less than 0.02). In addition, on the ACTH infusion day significant suppression of both PRA (P less than 0.05) and plasma angiotensin II (P less than 0.008) occurred during the alpha hANP infusion compared to that during the placebo infusion, whereas PRA was equally suppressed by angiotensin II in the presence or absence of alpha hANP. alpha hANP also increased urine volume [176 +/- 31 (+/- SEM) vs. 113 +/- 19 mL/mmol creatinine with placebo; P less than 0.03] and sodium excretion (2.14 +/- 0.48 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.22 mmol/mmol creatinine with placebo; P less than 0.004) on the ACTH infusion days. With angiotensin II, urine volume was also significantly increased by alpha hANP (150 +/- 27 vs. 81 +/- 15 mL/mmol creatinine with placebo; P less than 0.03), and urine sodium excretion doubled.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we reported that short term administration of a highly potent GnRH agonist (GnRHa) for 1 month to patients with polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) resulted in complete suppression of ovarian steroidogenesis without measurable effects on adrenal steroid production. This new study was designed to evaluate the effects of long term GnRHa administration in PCO patients with respect to their hormone secretion patterns and clinical responses. Eight PCO patients and 10 ovulatory women with endometriosis were treated daily with sc injections of [D-His6-(imBzl]),Pro9-NEt]GnRH (GnRHa; 100 micrograms) for 6 months. Their results were compared to hormone values in 8 women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomies. In response to GnRHa, PCO and ovulatory women had rises of serum LH at 1 month, after which it gradually declined to baseline. In both groups FSH secretion was suppressed throughout treatment. Serum estradiol, estrone, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone levels markedly decreased to values found in oophorectomized women by 1 month and remained low thereafter. In contrast, serum pregnenolone and 17-hydroxypregnenolone were partially suppressed, and dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and cortisol levels did not change. Clinically, hyperplastic endometrial histology in three PCO patients reverted to an inactive pattern, and proliferative endometrium in two other PCO patients became inactive in one and did not change in the other. Regression of proliferative endometrial histology occurred in all ovulatory women. Vaginal bleeding occurred in all women studied during the first month of GnRHa administration, after which all but one PCO patient became amenorrheic. Hot flashes were noted by all ovulatory women and by four of eight PCO patients. All PCO patients noted subjective reduction of skin oiliness, and five had decreased hair growth. We conclude that in premenopausal women: 1) chronic GnRHa administration results in apparently complete persistent suppression of ovarian steroid secretion; 2) adrenal steroid secretion is not influenced directly or indirectly; and 3) its use may be helpful in the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia and ovarian androgen excess in women with PCO.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of dihydroergocriptine (DHECP), a dihydrogenated ergot alkaloid with dopaminergic agonistic and alpha-adrenergic antagonistic properties, were studied in 22 women with PRL-secreting microprolactinomas and compared with those recorded in 36 previously studied patients treated with bromocriptine (BRC). After acute administration of 5 mg DHECP, orally, serum PRL decreased by 61 +/- 18% (+/- SD); only 1 patient was unresponsive. The nadir was reached at 300 min. Long term treatment with increasing DHECP doses caused a progressive PRL fall from 125 +/- 142 (+/- SD) to 81 +/- 159 micrograms/L after 1 week of a 3 mg twice daily regimen, to 64 +/- 88 micrograms/L after 1 week of 5 mg twice daily, 46 +/- 57 micrograms/L after 1 week of 10 mg twice daily, and 28 +/- 34 to 33 +/- 45 micrograms/L throughout 9 months of treatment with 10 mg DHECP 3 times daily. Seventy-seven percent of patients had normal serum PRL levels during chronic treatment. All women, including those with supranormal serum PRL levels, resumed regular menses, and 16 had ovulatory cycles; 1 woman became pregnant. Galactorrhea disappeared in all. During treatment the PRL response to TRH, initially absent in all patients, became positive in 10. In 7 patients, after DHECP treatment for 9 months, high definition computed tomographic scan no longer showed the focal lesions initially seen. After drug withdrawal, serum PRL increased again in all except 1 patient. Two patients had regular menses for 6 months, and 3 still had no adenoma imaged by high definition computed tomography. In BRC-treated patients the serum PRL changes and clinical results were very similar to those in the DHECP-treated patients, except for the persistence of normal serum PRL levels in 4 patients after drug withdrawal. On the other hand, side-effects were negligible during DHECP treatment, but remarkable during BRC. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by only 5.4 and 3.0 mm Hg, respectively, after acute 5 mg DHECP administration, but decreased by 12.8 and 14 mm Hg after acute 2.5 mg BRC administration. Orthostatic hypotension and peripheral vasomotor phenomena occurred in the long term DHECP treated patients except one, but they occurred in 9 and 3 of those treated with BRC, respectively. Gastric discomfort or mild nausea occurred in 12 DHECP-treated patients, while mild or severe nausea or vomiting were observed in 18, 11, and 2 of those taking BRC, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88008232\r", 
  ".W": "To characterize the spectrum of pulsatile gonadotropin secretion during the postmenarchal period, we studied 24 adolescents whose gynecological age was 1-4 yr. Six women with ovulatory cycles formed a control group. Eighteen women with anovulatory cycles were grouped on the basis of mean plasma LH values: group 1 (n = 8) with high LH values and group 2 (n = 10) with normal LH values. In all women, plasma gonadotropin concentrations were measured at 10-min intervals for 8 h on day 4 of the cycle. Pulsatile gonadotropin secretion was also studied a second time in 7 women from group 1 and 7 from group 2 after 5 days of progesterone (P) in oil treatment to assess the role of P in regulating gonadotropin secretion in the postmenarchal period. Group 1 had more frequent and greater LH pulses than the other two groups (which were very similar) and had the highest plasma 17 beta-estradiol, testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations. In all anovulatory women, basal LH values were correlated with the LH interpulse interval (r = -0.65; P less than 0.01) and pulse amplitude (r = 0.86; P less than 0.001). LH pulse amplitude was correlated with basal 17 beta-estradiol values (r = 0.74; P less than 0.001), and LH interpulse interval with basal T (r = -0.83; P less than 0.001), A (r = -0.51; P less than 0.05), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (r = -0.79; P less than 0.001) values. P administration decreased LH pulse frequency and increased LH pulse amplitude more in group 2 than in group 1 with high LH values; a clear reduction was also found in A, T, and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone values. These results indicate that 1) anovulatory young women with high plasma LH values have an alternative maturational pathway, different from that of anovulatory women with normal plasma LH values, who are similar to ovulatory adolescents; 2) the pulsatile pattern of gonadotropin secretion has specific roles linked separately to amplitude and frequency in controlling ovarian steroidogenesis, which accounts for the endocrine differences between groups; and 3) in the postmenarchal period, by modulating LH and FSH pulsatility and thus reducing androgen levels and their atretic action on follicles, P may be a basic regulatory factor in enhancing functional cyclicity.\r"

Granulocytes and macrophages from three patients in two kindreds with \"variant\" X-linked CGD (i.e., with very low, but detectable, baseline superoxide-generating activity) responded to IFN-gamma with enhanced nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and two- to eightfold increases in superoxide generation. IFN-gamma did not augment the respiratory burst activity of phagocytes from patients with \"classic\" CGD (i.e., no detectable baseline superoxide generation) or autosomal variant CGD. Incubation of a responding patient's granulocytes with IFN-gamma nearly doubled the maximal velocity for the NADPH oxidase, but did not change its abnormal Michaelis constant. Although the interferon-treated CGD granulocytes produced superoxide at a rate 40% of normal, the cytochrome b spectrum remained undetectable. IFN-gamma treatment of cultured monocytes from an IFN-gamma-responsive CGD patient increased the steady state level of RNA transcripts from the X-CGD gene from barely detectable up to approximately 5% of normal.\r"

Just before the onset of anemia, erythroid colony-forming cells (CFU-E) become undetectable in marrow culture, yet normal frequencies of erythroid burst-forming cells (BFU-E)- and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) persist. To determine if erythroid progenitors were uniquely infected with retrovirus, marrow mononuclear cells from cats viremic with FeLV-C were labeled with monoclonal antibodies to gp70 and then analyzed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Both erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors were among cells sorting positively, suggesting that infection of BFU-E alone did not result in PRCA. The results were confirmed by complement (C') lysis studies using baby rabbit or guinea pig sera as sources of C'. These studies also suggested that BFU-E from cats with PRCA were unusually sensitive to C' alone, without the addition of antibody. In further studies, we demonstrated that C' activation was via the classical pathway and that C' sensitivity was unique to BFU-E and not a property of CFU-E, CFU-GM, or progenitors that were capable of giving rise to BFU-E in suspension culture. As BFU-E from cats viremic with FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 or the Rickard strain of feline leukemia virus were not sensitive to C', this finding may relate to the pathogenesis of feline PRCA. We hypothesize that, in cats viremic with FeLV-C, the abnormal C' sensitivity of BFU-E leads to the absence of CFU-E and anemia.\r"

After preincubation for 120 min at 37 degrees C in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate containing 140 or 5 mM Na+ plus choline or lithium to maintain osmolarity, muscles were incubated with 50 pM [125I]triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) or [125I]L-thyroxine (T4) for 60 min. T3 uptake was decreased when extracellular Na+ was replaced by either choline or lithium, the amount of decrease corresponding to the specific (or saturable) uptake component. Monensin, an ionophore that stimulates Na+ entry, increased T3 uptake at 140 mM Na+ but not at 5 mM Na+. Amiloride, a Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor, had no effect on T3 uptake under basal conditions or when Na+ was replaced by choline, but reversed the action of lithium. Ouabain, an inhibitor of Na+/K+ ATPase, reduced specific T3 uptake. T4 uptake was unaffected by low extracellular Na+. These results are consistent with a major role of Na+ movement in T3 uptake by skeletal muscle, but not in T4 uptake, and suggest an involvement of membrane pumps in this process.\r"

Bowes melanoma cells but not smooth muscle cells cultured on BSMC matrices decrease available matrix associated PA inhibitor.

  ".W": "The mechanism by which cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure synergistically increase the incidence of lung cancer is unknown. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke and asbestos might synergistically increase DNA damage. To test this hypothesis we exposed isolated bacteriophage PM2 DNA to cigarette smoke and/or asbestos, and assessed DNA strand breaks as an index of DNA damage. Our results supported our hypothesis. 78 +/- 12% of the DNA exposed to both cigarette smoke and asbestos developed strand breaks, while only 9.8 +/- 7.0 or 4.3 +/- 3.3% of the DNA exposed to cigarette smoke or asbestos, respectively, developed strand breaks under the conditions of the experiment. Our experimental evidence suggested that cigarette smoke and asbestos synergistically increased DNA damage by stimulating .OH formation. First, significant amounts of .OH were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in DNA mixtures containing both cigarette smoke and asbestos, but no .OH was detected in mixtures containing cigarette smoke alone or asbestos alone. Second, the .OH scavengers, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), mannitol, or Na benzoate decreased both .OH detection by EPR and strand breaks in DNA mixtures exposed to cigarette smoke and asbestos. Third, the H2O2 scavenger, catalase, and the iron chelators, 1,10-phenanthroline and desferrithiocin, decreased both .OH detection and strand breaks in DNA mixtures exposed to cigarette smoke and asbestos. These latter findings suggest that iron contained in asbestos may catalyze the formation of .OH from H2O2 generated by cigarette smoke. In summary, our study indicates that cigarette smoke and asbestos synergistically increase DNA damage and suggests that this synergism may involve .OH production.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a model to study the effects of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) transmigration on the intestinal epithelial barrier. Human PMN were induced to transmigrate across high resistance monolayers of a cultured human intestinal epithelial cell line (T84 cells) by chemotactic gradients produced by formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP). With maximal transmigration monolayer resistance decreased by 48 +/- 12.6% in 15 min and by 83 +/- 1.6% in 60 min. This response was dependent on the size of the FMLP gradient and the density of PMN transmigration. The decrease in resistance correlated with number of PMN migrating across monolayers, and was accompanied by increases in flux of paracellular tracers. Macromolecular tracer studies localized the leak sites to foci at which PMN impaled the epithelium. Removal of the chemotactic gradient led to restoration of baseline resistance within 18 h. PMN transmigration across intestinal epithelial monolayers occurs via intercellular occluding junctions and may be associated with a reversible increase in epithelial permeability.\r"

  ".U": "88008354\r", 
  ".W": "Human alveolar macrophages release chemotactic activity for neutrophils, providing a role for alveolar macrophages in regulating inflammation in the lung. As alveolar macrophages produce large amounts of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a chemotactically active lipoxygenase product of arachidonic acid, we investigated the contribution of LTB4 to the total neutrophil chemotactic activity produced by these cells. Normal human alveolar macrophages were recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage from healthy volunteers and incubated either with the calcium ionophore A23187 for 1 h, or with opsonized zymosan particles or latex beads for 3 h. Nordihydroguaretic acid (NDGA), a relatively specific lipoxygenase inhibitor, blocked the release of neutrophil chemotactic activity after all three stimuli in a dose-dependent manner. This correlated with blockade of LTB4 production as measured by high performance liquid chromatography using freshly isolated alveolar macrophages, as well as blockade of [3H]LTB4 production by macrophages prelabeled with [3H]arachidonate. Molecular sieve chromatography using Sephadex G-50 confirmed that essentially all of the chemotactic activity in the stimulated macrophage supernatants co-eluted with authentic [3H]LTB4, and that NDGA completely blocked the chemotactic activity in the eluting fractions. Readdition of authentic LTB4 (1 X 10(-7) M) to the NDGA-blocked macrophage supernatants restored the chemotactic activity in the supernatants. The macrophage supernatants did not contain platelet-activating factor-like activity, as measured by the stimulation of [3H]serotonin release from rabbit platelets, and by high performance liquid chromatography. NDGA did not change the protein-secretion profiles of fresh alveolar macrophages, or of macrophages prelabeled with [35S]methionine. The complement (C) components C5adesarg were not detected in any of the supernatants by radioimmunoassay. Concentration of the supernatants by positive pressure filtration (5,000-D membrane) did not augment chemotactic activity in the stimulated supernatants or uncover chemotactic activity in the NDGA-blocked supernatants. As with the 3-h studies, when alveolar macrophages were incubated overnight with opsonized zymosan, all of the increase in chemotactic activity could also be blocked by NDGA. These data indicate that LTB4 is the predominant neutrophil chemotactic factor secreted by the normal resident human alveolar macrophage in response to two major types of stimuli, calcium fluxes across the cell membrane and the phagocytosis of opsonized particulates.\r"

  ".U": "88008373\r", 
  ".W": "Essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency exerts a beneficial effect on immune-mediated glomerulonephritis, preventing both the tissue injury and consequent mortality. Because both macrophages and eicosanoids are thought to play pathogenic roles in glomerulonephritis, and because macrophages play an important role in modulating arachidonate metabolism at sites of renal injury, the effects of EFA deficiency on the population of resident glomerular macrophages and on glomerular eicosanoid generation were examined. EFA deficiency led to a striking reduction in the number of resident glomerular macrophages and a corresponding reduction in the number of resident glomerular Ia+ cells. This phenomenon was not strain-specific, was not due to a decrease in circulating monocytes, was not a function of changes in cell surface labeling characteristics, and was not restricted to a specific subset of glomeruli. In addition, EFA deficiency affected other areas of the renal cortex: a comparable depletion of interstitial macrophages and Ia+ cells was also observed. In conjunction with the decrease in glomerular macrophages seen with the deficiency state, a marked decrease in both basal and angiotensin II-stimulated glomerular eicosanoid production was noted. In contrast to angiotensin II, platelet-activating factor-induced eicosanoid production was not significantly affected by the deficiency state. These changes in glomerular eicosanoid production could not be attributed to changes in glomerular cyclooxygenase or reacylation capacity. Dietary (n-6) fatty acid supplementation, but not (n-3) fatty acid supplementation, reversed both the decrease in glomerular macrophages and the diminished eicosanoid metabolism seen with the deficiency state. Understanding the mechanisms behind the changes in the glomerular microenvironment induced by EFA deficiency may provide a basis for elucidating the protective effect of dietary fatty acid manipulation on immune-mediated glomerulonephritis.\r"

  ".W": "We have segregated DR1+ individuals into two categories according to whether or not their class II+ cells stimulated T lymphocyte clones specific for or restricted to DR1. In a majority of cases (87%), failure to stimulate was a property of cells having the B14;DR1 haplotype and/or nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Absence of clonal proliferation could not be explained by release of an intercellular suppressor factor or by stimulator cell absorption of interleukin 2. Homozygous cells inheriting both stimulatory (DR1n) and nonstimulatory (DR1x) haplotypes did not successfully mediate clonal expansion, implying that a trans acting factor operates intracellularly to modify both DR1 alleles or their products. Other DR alleles did not appear to be affected as evidence by normal proliferative responses of T lymphocyte clones restricted to DR2 or DR7 and stimulated by DR1x,2 and DR1x,7 cells, respectively. By two-dimensional gel analysis, we have further identified a 50-kD surface glycoprotein contained in anti-DR immunoprecipitates of DR1x, but not DR1n or non-DR1 cellular lysates. This 50-kD structure had antigenic and peptide identity to DR alpha and beta chains but was resistant to dissociation under conditions that normally separate DR alpha and beta (8 M urea plus 5% 2-mercaptoethanol); boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate was required to segregate the component polypeptides of the 50-kD heterodimer. We postulate that a product of a novel combinatorial association between constitutive chains of DR may interfere with or compete for normal T cell receptor recognition of DR1 as both an alloantigen and a restricting element. We further propose that gene abnormalities within the class III region of a haplotype associated with nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency may extend into the DR subregion of the major histocompatibility complex with consequent aberrations in DR1 presentation.\r"

The lower dose of atrial natriuretic factor did not change significantly any of the considered variables, although it tended to reduce aortic mean blood pressure (from 132.6 +/- 5.3 to 125.5 +/- 4.6 mm Hg), cardiac index (from 3.67 +/- 0.2 to 3.54 +/- 0.18 liters/min per m2) and forearm vascular resistance (from 178.6 +/- 15 to 148.3 +/- 10 mm Hg/ml per s). The higher dose of atrial natriuretic factor significantly reduced mean aortic pressure (118.6 +/- 5 mm Hg), cardiac index (3.29 +/- 0.16 liters/min per m2) and stroke volume index (from 45.9 +/- 2.6 to 38.9 +/- 3 ml/m2) and slightly decreased pulmonary wedge pressure, whereas both total peripheral resistance and forearm vascular resistance were not modified. With this latter dose a reduction in aortic pressure was observed in all patients at the steady state, and this was associated with a fall in stroke volume index in 10 of the 13 patients and with a reduction in total peripheral resistance in only 6 patients. Heart rate and right atrial and pulmonary pressures did not change during infusion of atrial natriuretic factor. Plasma renin activity was only slightly reduced by atrial natriuretic factor, whereas plasma norepinephrine rose significantly (from 233 +/- 34 to 330 +/- 58 pg/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Increasingly, the profession is being required to justify the costs of clinical care to society, government and third party payers. Such justifications can be effectively presented when structured in decision analytic format. To demonstrate the utility of decision analysis and its extension--cost-effectiveness analysis--as a technique for presenting the rationale for clinical practices and technology utilization, the Cardiovascular Norms Committee of the American College of Cardiology sponsored a model cost-effectiveness analysis. Alternative management options, 6 month mortality and costs for the post-myocardial infarction patient were compared. The options included exercise electrocardiography, exercise thallium scintigraphy and coronary angiography, followed by coronary artery bypass surgery for patients with left main coronary disease only or patients with left main disease, three vessel disease or single or double vessel disease and a significant amount of myocardium in jeopardy. Within the constraints of the model, proceeding directly to angiography for risk stratification was the most effective approach, lowering expected mortality from 8% to approximately 3%. The marginal costs for this strategy, however, were high. The most cost-effective approach was to screen patients initially with exercise electrocardiography.\r"

A study was undertaken to define and describe enteral feeding practices of registered dietitians (R.D.s) and physicians (M.D.s) in Connecticut. Survey questionnaires were returned by 74.5% of R.D.s and 53.3% of M.D.s. Data were analyzed for 195 respondents. Overall, there were more similarities than differences between R.D.s and M.D.s. Malnutrition was the most frequent indication for tube feedings. Dietitians and physicians selected formulas on the basis of nutrient needs of the patients, but R.D.s gave significantly more weight to formula design and nutrient composition than did M.D.s. Lactose-free low-residue, high-calorie high-nitrogen, and elemental diets were considered to be the most desirable products to include in a hospital formulary. Dietitians more frequently monitored nutrition-related parameters, whereas M.D.s followed metabolic parameters of patients on tube feeding. Physicians relied on R.D.s to recommend formulas and to provide them with enteral nutrition information. The results from this study may be useful in planning nutrition education programs, evaluating standards for enteral nutrition practice, and improving utilization of enteral nutrition therapy.\r"

LES pressures were determined before and after the administration of normal saline subcutaneously, terbutaline sulfate subcutaneously, nitroglycerin sublingually, and aminophylline intravenously. All smooth muscle relaxants significantly decreased LES pressures when compared with normal saline controls and pretreatment baseline pressures (p less than 0.01). However, in normal saline controls, LES pressure actually increased over time (p less than 0.01). Control radionuclide esophageal emptying studies were performed in all patients. Subsequent esophageal emptying studies were carried out only in patients responding to smooth muscle relaxants by decreasing LES pressures by greater than or equal to 25% (terbutaline sulfate, n = 8; nitroglycerin, n = 7; and aminophylline, n = 4). Significant improvement in esophageal emptying was observed after nitroglycerin and terbutaline sulfate (p less than 0.05) but not after aminophylline. We conclude that in patients with achalasia (a) terbutaline sulfate, nitroglycerin, and aminophylline can significantly decrease LES pressure; (b) resting LES pressures vary over time; and (c) terbutaline sulfate and nitroglycerin significantly improve esophageal emptying in some subjects.\r"

To better define this relationship, we have studied c-fos, c-myc, and c-myb mRNA induction in T lymphocytes where early and late activation events have been clearly delineated. In T cells, initial activation from G0 to G1 results from stimulation of either the antigen/major histocompatibility complex receptor (T3-Ti) or the T11 structure; further cycle progression and proliferation follow interaction of interleukin 2 (IL-2) with the IL-2 receptor. These events can be dissected with monoclonal antibodies to T3 or T11 which cause early activation but differ in their ability to initiate IL-2-dependent cycle progression and proliferation. In T lymphocytes triggered through either T3-Ti or T11, c-fos is induced with a nonmitogenic activation signal whereas c-myb is only induced with a mitogenic signal capable of triggering IL-2 and IL-2 receptor expression. Furthermore, c-myc induction is biphasic and associated with both early and late activation events. Early c-myc, like c-fos, is induced with a nonmitogenic signal. In contrast, induction of late c-myc, like that of c-myb, requires a mitogenic signal. Thus, appearance of c-fos and initial c-myc mRNA seem to be early responses to membrane signaling whereas late c-myc and c-myb are more directly associated with actual cellular proliferation. That nonmitogenic stimulation of T cells via T3-Ti not only abrogates T11-mediated proliferation but also eliminates late c-myc and c-myb transcription further supports this notion.\r"

  ".U": "88009078\r", 
  ".W": "Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent kinase activity (C-kinase) plays an important second messenger role in T lymphocyte responses initiated by the cluster of differentiation (CD3) complex and presumably also lectinic receptors. During treatment with submitogenic or mitogenic amounts of phytohemagglutinin, as well as with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and 12-O-tetradecanoyl 13-phorbol acetate, the enzyme was intracellularly redistributed between the cytosol and the surface membrane. Submitogenic amounts of lectin and anti-CD3 were ineffective in inducing proliferation unless exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) was supplied, implying that even though IL-2 receptors were expressed, additional signals were required for IL-2 production. This would also indicate that there is a direct relationship between activation of C-kinase and expression of IL-2 receptors. The importance of C-kinase was further substantiated by the ability of 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H7), a potent inhibitor of this enzyme, to interfere with IL-2 receptor expression and cellular [methyl-3H]thymidine uptake during primary activation. The drug concentration at which these cellular responses were inhibited by 50% was about the same as that which decreased c-kinase activity by 50% in vitro. H7 also prevented anti-CD3-induced translocation in intact cells. This effect may be related to competition with the phosphatidylserine binding site, which is important for membrane attachment. This drug apparently also interferes with the active center of the enzyme as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit Ca2+/phospholipid-independent phosphorylation of protamine sulfate. This additional mode of inhibition may be important in suppressing intact cell responses under circumstances during which the enzyme displacement to the membrane is nonphysiologic in nature, e.g., during treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl 13-phorbol acetate.\r"

  ".W": "We have used the monoclonal antibody OKT8 to demonstrate that the cluster designation (CD)8 antigen on cytotoxic human T cells undergoes a previously unreported protein modification. Immunoprecipitation of CD8 with OKT8 from a CD8+ and CD4+ T cell line prelabeled with [32P]phosphate demonstrates that CD8 can be constitutively labeled with phosphate. CD8 undergoes rapid and intense phosphorylation in serine upon addition of phorbol myristate acetate to the cells. CD8 phosphorylation is induced upon addition of heterologous, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells, which cause proliferation and are target cells for a cytotoxic CD8+CD4+ T cell line and a CD8+CD4- T cell clone. Phosphorylation induced by targets is dose-dependent, rapid, and followed by a fast dephosphorylation. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells that do not induce proliferation of and are not targets for the CD8+CD4+ line and the CD8+CD4- clone do not induce CD8 phosphorylation. Cloned CD8+CD4- cells that proliferate in response to target cells, but lyse them only in the presence of lectin do not undergo target cell-induced CD8 phosphorylation. These data suggest that induction of CD8 phosphorylation is antigen-specific and is coincident with the cytotoxic response. Finally, preincubation of effector and target cells with an antibody to a monomorphic determinant of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens reduces target-induced CD8 phosphorylation to a greater extent than antibody to a major histocompatibility complex class II subregion (DR) monomorphic determinant, reinforcing the notion that major histocompatibility complex class I antigens interact with CD8+ cells.\r"

  ".W": "Culture of murine splenic B cells with interleukin 4 (IL-4) caused the up-regulation of the lymphocyte Fc receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) (Fc epsilon R) over a similar dose range as required for Ia up-regulation. However, the expression level of the Fc receptor for immunoglobulin G (Fc gamma R) did not increase, rather IL-4 caused a slight but consistent decrease in the Fc gamma R level on the B cells. Fc epsilon R+ B hybridoma cells also responded to IL-4 by exhibiting increased Fc epsilon R expression; with the hybridoma cells Fc gamma R levels were unaffected. IL-4 caused an increase in the number of Fc epsilon R per cell and the highest levels of expression were obtained by having both IgE and IL-4 present in the culture. The specificity of the increase was demonstrated by blocking IL-4-mediated actions with monoclonal anti-IL-4 (11B11). Experiments following the incorporation of [35S]methionine into the Fc epsilon R demonstrated that IL-4 increased the rate of Fc epsilon R biosynthesis; this provides an explanation for the IL-4-induced increase in Fc epsilon R expression. IL-4, unlike IgE, had no effect on the rate of degradation of the Fc epsilon R. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) totally abrogated IL-4-mediated Fc epsilon R up-regulation; at the same concentration of IFN-gamma Ia up-regulation is also suppressed, although not as effectively. IFN-gamma was shown to directly suppress Fc epsilon R synthesis, thereby explaining the inhibitory action on Fc epsilon R levels. Finally, it was shown that 11B11 inhibited the increased expression of Fc epsilon R on B cells obtained from mice during the early, but not the late, stages of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection. This latter finding suggests that the high Fc epsilon R levels seen early in parasite infections are dependent upon IL-4. The results overall provide further insight into the biologic activities of IL-4.\r"

  ".W": "Several alloreactive human T cell clones derived from a rejected kidney graft were found to produce in their culture supernatants soluble interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2R) upon specific antigenic challenge (irradiated B cell line from the graft's donor). Among them, the 2B11, a high producer clone, was used to purify a soluble IL-2R preparation which was analyzed, in comparison with the high and low affinity cell-surface IL-2R expressed by 2B11 cells, for its parameters of interaction with a set of anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and IL-2. This soluble receptor purified by affinity chromatography (anti-IL-2R mAb column) and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis is composed of a single chain of 35,000 to 45,000 Da. Immunoradiometric assays (IRMA) at equilibrium were set up, using pairs of mAb directed against two separate epitopes on the Tac antigen of the human IL-2R, to measure the respective dissociation constant of these mAb for the soluble IL-2R. They were found to be identical to those found on the cell-surface IL-2R. A 1:1 stoichiometry between the two epitopes were found both on the membrane and soluble species. Competition experiments between membrane and soluble IL-2R for binding the mAb allowed the quantitative analysis of the concentration of soluble IL-2R without the need of amino acid analysis on purified material and set up a quantitative IRMA for the human soluble IL-2R (detection limit 5 pM). The affinity of the soluble IL-2R for IL-2 was determined by various techniques including an IRMA using an anti-IL-2R mAb and radiolabeled IL-2. The results obtained led us to conclude that the soluble IL-2R binds IL-2 with a dissociation constant (KD = 30 nM) identical to that found for the binding of IL-2 to low affinity cell-surface IL-2R (Tac antigen). Whereas 2.5% of cell-surface IL-2R expressed 2 days after antigenic stimulation of 2B11 cells were of high affinity for IL-2 (KD = 25 pM), no (less than 0.07%) high affinity binding sites could be detected on the purified soluble IL-2R. This soluble IL-2R therefore likely corresponds to a truncated, extracellular part of the membrane Tac antigen. The amounts of soluble Tac antigen produced by the 2B11 alloreactive human T cell clone did not exceed 1 nM and, as expected from the binding studies, did not affect IL-2-induced T cell proliferation. The physiologic and pathologic implications of our results are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Human endothelial cells and dermal fibroblasts both expressed a membrane-associated interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity when stimulated with either recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or recombinant lymphotoxin but stimulated endothelial cells expressed significantly more membrane IL-1 per cell than did fibroblasts. Lipopolysaccharide induced membrane IL-1 activity on endothelial cells but not fibroblasts. Interferon-gamma treatment of endothelial cells and fibroblasts had no direct effect on membrane IL-1 expression and little effect when used as a pretreatment for TNF or lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Endothelial cell membrane IL-1 activity was induced within 24 hr of culture with TNF or lipopolysaccharide, and increased up to 72 hr of incubation. Antibodies raised against human monocyte-derived IL-1 species neutralized the membrane IL-1 activity of TNF-stimulated endothelial cells. Both absorption studies and neutralization with specific sera indicated that endothelial cell membrane IL-1 is structurally related to IL-1 alpha. Endothelial cells expressed both IL-1 beta mRNA in response to TNF, lymphotoxin, and recombinant IL-1 species, as detected by Northern blot analysis. These studies demonstrate that endothelial cells can be activated to express a cell-surface IL-1 activity which is structurally, as well as functionally, related to the secreted form of IL-1.\r"

  ".W": "Once stimulated with Toxoplasma gondii or cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy seropositive donors secrete comparable levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Both antigens also stimulated specific production of interleukin 2 (IL-2), a lymphokine believed to be important in IFN-gamma generation. T. gondii antigen, however, induced ninefold more IL-2 than did CMV antigen suggesting different mechanisms for antigen-stimulated IFN-gamma production. Therefore, we examined for both antigens 1) the cellular sources of IL-2 and IFN-gamma, 2) the kinetics of IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression, and 3) the effect of antibodies to IL-2 and IL-2R on IFN-gamma secretion. For both antigens, IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion was T4+ cell-dependent. T. gondii antigen induced high levels of IL-2 at 24 hr which increased further at 48 hr, and IFN-gamma production was strongly inhibited by antibodies to both IL-2 (90 +/- 2%) and IL-2R (80 +/- 5%). In contrast, CMV antigen stimulated low levels of IL-2 at 24 hr which declined still further by 48 hr, and CMV-stimulated IFN-gamma generation was appreciably less well inhibited by antibodies to IL-2 (47 +/- 2%) and IL-2R (31 +/- 8%). These results suggest the possibility of two mechanisms for antigen-induced IFN-gamma production--one primarily dependent on and the other largely independent of IL-2 and its receptor. Both mechanisms, however, require the activity of sensitized T4+ cells.\r"

The results indicate that TF5 but not kidney fraction 5 (a preparation used as control) is able to enhance the spontaneous NK activity of normal LGL. In addition, TF5 exhibited additive effects with recombinant interferon-alpha in enhancing NK activity in vitro. TF5 also enhanced interleukin 2 production and interleukin 2 receptor expression as well as interferon-gamma production in mitogen-stimulated LGL. Thymosin-alpha 1, a synthetic polypeptide originally isolated in its native form from TF5, also exhibited enhancing effects on LGL activities, suggesting that it is the active species in TF5. These results indicate that thymic hormones might regulate NK activity through the induction of lymphokine production and receptor expression by LGL.\r"

This first signal can be delivered in vitro (with anti-mu antibody (Ab)) or in vivo. Upon costimulation with anti-mu Ab the 50,000 BCGF induces an early and transient proliferative response, whereas the response to interleukin 2 (IL-2) develops more progressively. To determine the respective targets of the 50,000 BCGF and of IL-2, B cells were activated with anti-mu Ab and separated according to the expression of the IL-2 receptor (cluster designation (CD)25 antigen). CD25+ B cells do not respond to the 50,000 BCGF and do not acquire this responsiveness after an additional culture with IL-2. CD25- B cells respond to the 50,000 BCGF and not to IL-2. However, when CD25- B cells are cultured for 3 days with the 50,000 BCGF they become responsive to IL-2. These results demonstrate a pathway of B cell activation based on the ordered and sequential action of anti-mu Ab, the 50,000 BCGF, and IL-2.\r"

  ".W": "The maintenance of T lymphocytes which are important effectors of immune responses requires the T cell growth factor, interleukin 2 (IL-2). The binding of IL-2 to specific cell-surface receptors (IL-2R) has previously been shown to be essential to the growth and proliferation of activated lymphocytes. A human IL-2R cDNA sequence, placed under the control of the SV40 transcriptional promoter and enhancer, has been transfected into murine L cells. Single cell analysis by autoradiography was used to show that fibroblastic L cells, stably expressing human IL-2R, respond to stimulation with IL-2 by DNA synthesis and proliferation. This response is specifically blocked by the addition of an anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibody, anti-Tac, as previously reported. Neither nonspecific antisera nor 7G7/B6, an anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibody which does not interfere with IL-2 binding to its receptor, had any effect on this response. The induction of DNA synthesis by IL-2 is both rapid and dose-dependent. The ability of IL-2 to stimulate these transfected L cells to proliferate demonstrates that a lymphoid environment is not required for the functional interaction between IL-2 and its receptor, and provides a unique model system for the investigation of the molecular basis for the cellular events mediated by IL-2.\r"

  ".W": "Although inhibition of polymorphonuclear leukocyte activation by beta-adrenoceptor agonists has been recognized for over a decade, effects have only been observed at high drug concentrations and in the presence of theophylline. In this study, catecholamine and prostaglandin modulation of the respiratory burst was evaluated with respect to the mechanism of polymorphonuclear leukocyte activation. Very low concentrations of isoproterenol and prostaglandin E2 inhibited the respiratory burst when induced by chemotactic peptide (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) or calcium ionophore (A23187, ionomycin), but not when initiated by synthetic diacylglycerol. Because formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and ionophore mobilize calcium and arachidonic acid generation follows an increase in intracellular calcium, the arachidonic acid metabolite leukotriene B4 was studied. Isoproterenol at a very low (0.1 nM) concentration also rapidly inhibited leukotriene B4 generation. Since cyclic AMP was increased by isoproterenol regardless of the means of cell activation, modulation of intracellular calcium was evaluated with the fluorescent probe indo-1. A transient increase in calcium after formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or ionophore (but not oleoyl acetylglycerol) cell activation was inhibited by isoproterenol or prostaglandin E2. These results suggest that adrenergic agonists specifically modulate calcium-dependent polymorphonuclear leukocyte function. Because marked inhibition was observed at very low drug concentrations, cyclic AMP-dependent effects may be important in both homeostatic and therapeutic modulation of inflammatory response.\r"

  ".W": "Antigen immunoglobulin E-mediated secretion of histamine from RBL-2H3 cells is associated with substantial hydrolysis of membrane inositol phospholipids and a rise in the concentration of cytosol Ca2+ (calcium signal). Such responses differed among cloned variant lines of the RBL-2H3 cell line from undetectable (1A3 bromodeoxyuridine-resistant (BUDRR), 2B1 BUDRR, and 1B3 BUDRR lines) to about 80% of those in the parent RBL-2H3 cells. In all but one line (1B3 thioguanine-resistant (TgR)), the intensities of the phosphoinositide response and of the calcium signal were correlated with the secretory response. The 1B3 TgR line had no detectable calcium signal (as measured by quin 2 fluorescence or uptake of 45Ca2+) but paradoxically showed modest rates of hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and of secretion. The responses of the 1B3 TgR line were, however, dependent on the presence of external Ca2+ ions. The induction of secretion with antigen, therefore, was invariably associated with the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, but it was not necessarily associated with a change in concentration of cytosol Ca2+. All antigen unresponsive clones could secrete when synergistic signals were induced by exposure to the Ca2+ -ionophore, A23187 and the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. These lines, otherwise, had immunoglobulin E receptors and had no obvious defect in their capacity to synthesize the inositol phospholipids or in their phenotypic expression of phospholipase C as measured in cell extracts. One finding of possible relevance to the role of guanosine 5'-triphosphate-regulatory proteins in the activation of phospholipase C was the inability of one antigen-nonresponsive line to respond to NaF (in intact cells) or to guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (in electrically permeabilized cells).\r"

EC retract and tend to lose reciprocal contact, whereas the distribution of stress fibers is changed and the cells tend to assume a migratory phenotype. The normal localization of vinculin at streaks corresponding to adhesion plaques and located at stress fiber endings is mostly lost and replaced by diffuse distribution of this protein related to the cell-substratum adhesion complex. The effects of PAF are appreciable after 10 min, become maximal after 30 min, and are fully reversible. The disappearance of F-actin in stimulated EC was analyzed by measuring the fluorescence of the cells after staining with fluorosceinated phalloidin, PAF, but not lyso-PAF and the enantiomer of PAF ([S] form), decreases in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion the fluorescence of the cells stained with fluoresceinated phalloidin. EC grown on fibronectin-coated polycarbonate filters restrict the diffusion of 125I-albumin; PAF promotes 125I-albumin diffusion with a concentration dependency similar to that for the PAF-induced cytoskeleton changes. Four different PAF-receptor antagonists belonging to four different series, CV-3988 (PAF-related framework), BN52021 (a natural terpenoid), BN53013 (a natural lignan) and 48740 RP (a synthetic antagonist) prevent the alteration induced by PAF. These findings, coupled to the lack of effect of the enantiomer of PAF ([S] form), support the existence of a specific mechanism of PAF-mediated activation of EC, most probably mediated by a putative receptor. These results explain part of the PAF mechanism of action in inducing the increase of vascular permeability in vivo.\r"

Specificity in cell-mediated immunity was tested by skin tests in guinea pigs sensitized with M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium intracellulare, and Mycobacterium kansasii and by lymphocyte proliferation tests. The 38-kDa antigen induced positive skin test reactions regardless of the Mycobacterium species used to sensitize the animal. The ability of the 38-kDa antigen to sensitize for cell-mediated immunity was tested by injecting mice with the 38-kDa antigen and challenging their lymphocytes in vitro with various mycobacterial antigens. Lymphocyte proliferation was observed in the presence of 38-kDa antigen, M. tuberculosis sonicate antigen, and tuberculin purified protein derivative and to M. kansasii and M. intracellulare.

The suppressive activity, which was also present in the serum of these chronically infected mice, appears to be specific for the induction of DTH and had no effect on the 3-hr immediate-type hypersensitivity. It also failed to modify the expression of DTH in presensitized mice. Furthermore, it did not affect the synthesis in normal recipients of specific antibody or the induction of helper T cells or cytotoxic T cells. It also failed to induce DTH tolerance as recipient mice with markedly reduced DTH were able to develop a normal DTH response after secondary immunization. The suppressive activity was produced by an Ig- macrophage-depleted splenic T cell population, whose capacity to secrete the suppressive substance was completely abrogated by treatment in vitro with anti-L3T4 antibody and complement, but not with anti-Lyt-2 antibody and complement. These results therefore demonstrate that L3T4+ T cells from mice chronically infected with T. cruzi can produce substances which interfere with the induction of DTH. This finding may help to identify the differential antigenic stimulatory requirement for the activation of the various subsets of T cells.\r"

These comparisons were based upon radioimmunoprecipitations and immunodepletion of [35S]methionine-labeled schistosomular and adult worm polypeptides, followed by one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analyses. The humoral responses of patently infected mice and of mice vaccinated once were remarkably similar and were directed against schistosome glycoproteins ranging in molecular size from greater than 300 to less than 10 kDa. Exposing mice to a second vaccination resulted in a marked change in the immune response, to one predominantly directed toward high molecular size glycoproteins. Sequential immunodepletion techniques identified five schistosomular and seven adult worm antigens that showed a greater or unique immunogenicity in vaccinated mice as compared with patently infected mice. These adult worm antigens were purified by preparative sequential immunoaffinity chromatography and used to prepare a polyclonal antiserum, anti-irradiated vaccine. This antiserum bound to the surface of live newly transformed and lung-stage schistosomula, as assessed by immunofluorescence assays, and was reactive with a number of 125I-labeled schistosomular surface polypeptides, including a doublet of 150 kDa that was also recognized by sera of vaccinated mice but not by sera of patently infected mice.\r"

  ".W": "In order to identify the V region genes encoding systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-derived anti-DNA autoantibodies, we have determined the nucleotide sequence of heavy chain mRNA from several DNA-binding immunoglobulins secreted by human hybridomas. We used the technique of cDNA primer extension for determining sequences of the VH, D, and JH gene segments of anti-DNA autoantibodies from three different primary hybridoma growths from an SLE patient and one hybridoma from a leprosy patient. Immunoglobulins from two of the SLE hybridomas expressed the same idiotype, Id-16/6, which is also expressed on immunoglobulins in sera of patients with active SLE. Their mRNA sequences showed complete homology to each other in the V, D, and J genes and more than 99% homology to the VH26 germ-line gene sequence, a member of the human VHIII gene family. The VH mRNA sequence of the third SLE hybridoma, 21/28, which was idiotypically unrelated to the other two, was 93% homologous to a different VH germ-line gene sequence, HA2, a member of the human VHI gene family. The fourth anti-DNA-producing hybridoma, 8E10, was derived from a leprosy patient of different ethnic origin than the SLE patient. It was idiotypically related to 21/28 and expressed a VH segment gene identical to that of 21/28. Hybridomas 21/28 and 8E10 shared sequence homology with the VH26 anti-DNA antibodies in the first complementarity-determining region. In addition, 21/28 shared sequence homology with the Id-16/6+ group in the region encoded by the D and J gene segments. Our findings indicate that some SLE autoantibodies are encoded by unmodified or scarcely modified VH germ-line genes that are conserved in the human population and identify two distinct VH germ-line genes that can encode segments of anti-DNA immunoglobulins.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoids have been shown to play a major role in influencing the activation of B lymphocytes. In view of our recent observation that dexamethasone exerts a marked suppressive effect on an early event in B cell activation that is stimulated by anti-Ig antibody, we investigated its activity on other stimuli that induce intracellular events similar to those produced by anti-Ig antibody. Because the intracellular events that occur after B cell stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate and the calcium ionophore A23187 appear to mimic those that occur after B cell stimulation with anti-Ig antibody, we studied whether the cellular responses elicited by these activation stimuli are affected in a similar fashion by dexamethasone. Whereas anti-Ig antibody-stimulated entry of G0 B cells to the G1 and S phase of the cell cycle was markedly suppressed by dexamethasone, phorbol myristate acetate/A23187 stimulation of these events was resistant to dexamethasone. Our finding that anti-Ig-induced cross-linking of B cell surface Ig, as measured by surface Ig capping, was not inhibited by dexamethasone suggested that corticosteroids inhibit anti-Ig-induced B cell proliferation at a step distal to membrane Ig cross-linking and proximal to phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis. This hypothesis is supported by experiments presented in this manuscript which demonstrate that dexamethasone inhibits anti-Ig-stimulated phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis. We also found that dexamethasone markedly inhibited anti-Ig antibody-stimulated increases in intracellular ionized calcium concentrations. This dexamethasone-mediated suppression is time-dependent as it is not seen when B cells are cultured with dexamethasone for less than 6 hr. Our data suggest that the immunomodulatory activity of glucocorticoids is exerted by binding to its nuclear receptor, thereby preventing the generation of second messengers required for cell activation after agonist-receptor interaction.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier studies have demonstrated that T cells activated in mixed lymphocyte reactions can exert positive as well as negative allogeneic effects on B cells expressing the appropriate alloantigens on their surface. We investigated the effect of in vivo priming of T cells with alloantigens on their capacity to help or suppress allogeneic B cell cultures against sheep erythrocytes. We used immunization protocols that have been shown to be optimal for induction of alloantigen-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and alloantigen-specific suppressor T (Ts) cells for DTH. The results show that in vivo stimulation with alloantigens, depending on the immunization route and the lymphoid organ studied, can be as effective as in vitro stimulation in increasing the frequency of alloantigen-specific helper T (Th) cells and Ts cells. Subcutaneous immunization induced a 10-fold frequency raise of Th cells as well as of Ts cells in the lymph nodes. In the spleen the Th cell population was hardly affected by s.c. immunization, whereas the Ts cell population increased by at least a factor 20. Intravenous immunization, on the other hand, selectively expanded the Th cell population in the spleen, whereas the splenic Ts cell population and the Th and Ts cells in the lymph nodes were not affected. Comparison of these results with our previous data concerning characteristics and the requirements of in vivo activation of alloantigen-specific DTH reactive T cells and of alloantigen-specific Ts cells suggest that different Ts cell populations are involved in suppression of alloantigen-specific DTH in vivo and of allogeneic suppression of in vitro induced sheep erythrocytes specific antibody formation.\r"

G4, in the presence and absence of IL-1. Lymphokine secretion, T cell proliferation, and antibody secretion by B cells all exhibited identical antigen dose responses. Thus, hapten-binding B cells presented low concentrations of haptenated conalbumin for activation of both the T and the antigen-presenting B cells. Whereas proliferation of D10 . G4 required the addition of IL-1, both lymphokine production and stimulation of B cells to antibody secretion occurred without exogenous IL-1. These results demonstrate that when B lymphocytes function as presenting cells for antigens that bind to their immunoglobulin receptors, activation of the responding T cells and the B cells themselves occur at similar concentrations of antigen. Moreover, for functional T-B interactions, antigen-presenting B and responding T lymphocytes constitute a complete system that requires no other accessory stimuli, whereas clonal expansion of T cells is dependent on accessory factors such as IL-1. Finally, since D10 . G4 secretes IL-4 but neither IL-2 nor interferon-gamma, our results demonstrate that differentiation of B cells as a consequence of direct (\"cognate\") interactions with helper T cells as well as of bystander B cells can occur in the absence of IL-1, IL-2, and interferon-gamma.\r"

To clarify the extent to which these different forms of helper activity could be carried out by individual T cells, we set up cultures in which B cells activated, and were in turn themselves stimulated by, limiting numbers of T cells through differences at the H-2 or Mls loci. At T cell doses at which responses were likely to represent the activity of individual helper T cells (or their immediate clonal progeny), we found that some T cells were able both to produce interleukin 2 (IL-2) and to induce secretion of both IgM and IgG, whereas others induced immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion without detectable IL-2 production, and still others made IL-2 but did not promote antibody secretion. We could not detect B cell stimulatory factor 1 production by alloantigen-stimulated T cells, and the addition of antibodies to B cell stimulatory factor 1 did not prevent Ig production. Two results, however--higher Ig accumulation in those wells that received an IL-2-producing cell, and inhibition by anti-IL-2 receptor antibodies of B cell but not T cell function--are consistent with a direct stimulatory effect of IL-2 on B cells in this system. The pattern of helper functions exhibited by T cells freshly isolated from mice differs from that inferred from studies of cloned lines of T cells in long term cultures.\r"

In this paper we report on studies of the molecules involved in TE cell-dependent mature thymocyte activation. TE-thymocyte interactions necessary for PHA-induced thymocyte activation were inhibited by monoclonal antibodies against the cluster of differentiation (CD)2 antigen on thymocytes and lymphocyte function-associated (LFA)-3 antigen on TE cells. Inhibition of TE accessory cell signals by antibodies against CD2 (alpha CD2) and LFA-3 (alpha LFA-3) antigens occurred early on during thymocyte activation and prevented thymocyte interleukin 2 receptor expression. Further, alpha CD2 and alpha LFA-3 inhibited PHA-induced thymocyte activation in whole thymic explant cultures suggesting a significant role of the CD2 and LFA-3 antigens in thymocyte activation when accessory cell signals for PHA-induced thymocyte triggering were delivered by cells within an intact thymic microenvironment.\r"

This phenomenon is generally ascribed to the host immune response directed against graft alloantigens, but its cellular and molecular basis are incompletely understood. In the present study we show that constitutively Ia-negative human microvascular endothelial cells (EC) can be induced to express surface class II human leukocyte antigens shortly after exposure to allogeneic lymphocytes in vitro. CD16+ (natural killer) and CD8+ (cytotoxic/suppressor) lymphocytes were efficient in triggering Ia antigen expression by EC, whereas CD4+ (helper/inducer) lymphocytes induced EC Ia expression only if cultured in the presence of autologous monocytes. Binding of lymphocytes to EC was shown to be essential for the subsequent induction of EC Ia, and anti-CD18 (LFA-1) antibody, which blocks lymphocyte-EC adhesion, was the only antibody of a panel of antilymphocyte antibodies that completely blocked the induction of EC Ia. Antibodies to interferon-gamma, which is a potent inducer of EC Ia, and to the CD3 T cell-surface antigen partly inhibited the induction of EC Ia by T cells, but neither antibody had any effect on Ia induction mediated by CD16+ cells, suggesting that T cells and natural killer cells utilize different mechanisms to induce Ia on EC. When combined with data from other laboratories indicating that Ia+ but not Ia- EC stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, our results suggest that the binding of EC by lymphocyte subpopulations followed by the induction of Ia antigen may represent the initial stage of incompatible allograft rejection.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical association of lupus anticoagulant antibodies with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis was the rationale for investigating the in vitro reactivity of these human hybridoma lupus anticoagulant antibodies with platelets. Fifty human hybridoma antibodies from 13 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 2 women with multiple spontaneous abortions, and 4 normal individuals were analyzed for lupus anticoagulant, antiplatelet, anti-DNA, and antiphospholipid reactivities. Of the hybridoma antibodies studied, 25 had lupus anticoagulant activity, 21 had antiplatelet reactivity, and 7 of these antibodies had both lupus anticoagulant and antiplatelet properties. No correlation was found between lupus anticoagulant antibody activity and antiplatelet, anti-denatured DNA, anticardiolipin, anti-egg phosphatidylethanolamine, antiphosphatidylserine, antiphosphatidylinositol, and antiphosphatidylcholine reactions. In contrast, antiplatelet activity was strongly correlated with antiphosphatidylethanolamine (rho = 0.761, p less than 0.001), anticardiolipin (rho = 0.748, p less than 0.001), and anti-dDNA (rho = 0.745, p less than 0.001) reactivities. Pretreatment of platelets with deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, trypsin, or phospholipases A2 and C resulted in different effects on the binding of individual hybridoma antibodies to platelets, suggesting that antiplatelet antibodies may recognize different epitopes on the platelet membrane. Our data demonstrate that most hybridoma lupus anticoagulant antibodies did not bind directly to platelets in vitro. This suggests that additional serum factors may be required in vivo to explain the association of these antibodies with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "We have established and characterized long term thymic stromal cultures from BALB/c (H-2d) and CBA/J (H-2k) mice. All cultures contained multiple adherent cell types, whereas some also contained thymic macrophages (TM). Culture supernatants from all cultures tested contained macrophage colony-stimulating factor activity, whereas only cultures with TM had soluble or membrane-associated interleukin (IL)-1. However, a thymic epithelial cell line (3D . 1), cloned from one of these cultures, produced IL-1 bioactivity. Further analysis confirmed the production of IL-1 alpha mRNA by the epithelial cell. No IL-2 or IL-4 (formerly called B cell stimulatory factor 1) activity was detected in any of the cultures. Antigen-presenting (AP) ability was determined using the chicken ovalbumin (OVA)-specific, I-Ad-restricted T cell hybridoma 3DO-18.3. Harvested TM exhibited antigen-specific, Ia-restricted AP ability which was enhanced by IL-4 as well as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In contrast, AP ability was detected in non-macrophage stromal cell cultures (NMSC) only after preincubation with IFN-gamma. AP by preinduced NMSC was also Ia-restricted and could be blocked by anti-I-Ad antibodies. Since the T cell receptor of 3DO-18.3 is known to recognize a peptide produced by CNBr degradation of OVA, these observations suggest that both TM and NMSC can process OVA to produce this peptide. Glutaraldehyde-fixation experiments confirmed that NMSC must process native OVA into antigenic peptides for successful AP. Assays using several cloned stromal cell lines of different lineages suggested that only epithelial cells could be induced with IFN-gamma to exhibit competent AP. Given the possible role for IFN-gamma in the maintenance of Ia in the thymus, we investigated whether IFN-gamma production could be ascribed to a subpopulation of thymocytes. Culture supernatants from calcium ionophore and phorbol ester-stimulated peanut agglutinin-negative, but not peanut agglutinin-positive, thymocytes induced AP ability in NMSC. Thus, some thymocytes can produce an Ia-inducing lymphokine (most likely IFN-gamma) which may play an important role in T cell ontogeny through its effects on both thymic macrophages and thymic epithelial cells.\r"

In these studies, we have examined the ability of C5a and C5a des Arg to induce IL-1 production in vitro. Human C5a and C5a des Arg were purified to homogeneity and were found to stimulate IL-1 release from freshly obtained human mononuclear cells into the extracellular medium. Only 2 hr of exposure to the purified complement components were necessary in order to stimulate IL-1 production. The minimal concentration of C5a required was 25 ng/ml, whereas 125 ng/ml of C5a des Arg induced comparable amounts of IL-1. This dose relationship was maintained at higher concentrations (150 ng/ml vs 750 ng/ml, respectively). That the effect was due to the anaphylatoxins themselves, and not endotoxin contamination, was shown by negative Limulus amebocyte lysate tests and employing preincubation of C5a/C5a des Arg with polymyxin B. The latter blocked a wide dose range of endotoxin-stimulated IL-1 production. However, when endotoxin was added to C5a or C5a des Arg, significant synergism in the stimulation of IL-1 production was observed, occurring at various concentrations of either agent. A similar synergism with C5a/C5a des Arg was seen with interferon-gamma. In these studies, IL-1 production was measured by bioassay employing cloned D . 10 . G4 . 1 murine T cells and by radioimmunoassay for human IL-1 beta; using C5a/C5a des Arg as stimulants, there was a high degree of correlation (r = 0.82) between the two assays. Since traumatic, infectious, and inflammatory diseases may result in the simultaneous appearance of these stimuli, the synergism described herein is likely to be clinically relevant.\r"

Three of five cell lines constitutively express H-2K and H-2D class I protein. Culturing these cells with interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alpha/beta, or tumor necrosis factor increases both K and D expression in these cell lines. Two of five tumor cell lines express no class I proteins by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, specific immunoprecipitation, and specific hybridization in Northern analysis. Treatment with IFN-gamma induces D, but not K protein expression in one of these cell lines. IFN-alpha/beta and tumor necrosis factor induce neither D nor K expression in this cell line. Thus, these two cytokines appear to have different mechanisms of action than IFN-gamma for altering class I expression. The other class I-negative tumor cell line does not express either K or D proteins under any conditions tested. All five cell lines express beta 2-microglobulin; this expression is increased by IFN-gamma treatment even in cell lines which do not express class I heavy chain. The results of this study demonstrate that 1) different tumor cell lines demonstrate variations in class I gene regulation, and 2) differences in regulation between class I genes may occur within a single cell line.\r"

  ".W": "C3H/HeJ mice are hyporesponsive to the biologic effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The defect in the strain of mice is believed to be due to the expression of a mutant allele designated Lpsd at the chromosome four locus. The molecular basis of this hyporesponsiveness is not known, but it may result from some defective membrane signal transductions. To examine this possibility, we compared the abilities of interleukin 1 (IL-1) production by C3H/HeJ macrophages with those by C3H/He macrophages (LPS responsive) after stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187 or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). A23187 induced IL-1 production by C3H/He macrophages, but it did not induce IL-1 production by C3H/HeJ macrophages and neither did LPS. However, it had the ability to increase intracellular free Ca2+ in C3H/HeJ macrophages as well as in C3H/He macrophages, this being examined by the changes in cytosolic Ca2+ in the macrophages by using Quin 2. In contrast, PMA was able to induce IL-1 production by both C3H/He and C3H/HeJ macrophages without increasing intracellular Ca2+. Since polymyxin B did not inhibit A23187- or PMA-induced IL-1 production by C3H/He macrophages, these results are not due to the little amount of LPS in culture medium, but due to their own characteristics. A calmodulin antagonist W-7 effectively inhibited A23187-induced IL-1 production by C3H/He macrophages. However, it hardly inhibited LPS-induced IL-1 production except at high concentration, and it caused no inhibition of the PMA-stimulated one. These results suggest that the blocking sites expressed phenotypically by the Lpsd are shared by LPS- and A23187-stimulated cellular processes, although the actions of LPS and A23187 are different from each other. In addition to the direct study with LPS or lipid A, A23187 should provide another useful approach to clarify the molecular mechanisms of Lpsd defect in C3H/HeJ macrophages.\r"

  ".U": "88009156\r", 
  ".W": "Phorbol esters, such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), are known to be potent co-stimulants with calcium ionophores for activation of T lymphocytes. The most extensively studied intracellular effect of PMA is its ability to activate the cytoplasmic enzyme protein kinase C (pkC). Herein, we examined the role of pkC activation during T cell activation. During physiologic activation, this enzyme is activated by diacylglycerol which is generated through the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides. Therefore, we studied the activation of T lymphocytes induced by a synthetic diacylglycerol, dioctanoylglycerol. In contrast to PMA, this compound can be metabolized in T cells and presumably more closely mimics physiologic activation of pkC. Dioctanoylglycerol together with reagents that induce increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, Ca2+ ionophores, or anti-cluster designation (CD)3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were able to induce interleukin 2 receptor expression and proliferation of T lymphocytes. Previous studies have demonstrated that the stimulation of T cells via the CD3/T cell antigen receptor complex by mAb against CD3 leads to an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ and to an activation of pkC. Paradoxically, however, soluble CD3 antibodies do not cause proliferation of resting purified T cells. Inasmuch as immobilization of CD3 mAb has been shown to influence the agonist properties of such antibodies, we compared the ability of soluble and immobilized CD3 mAb to activate pkC. We demonstrated herein that soluble CD3 mAb cause only a very transient activation of pkC in the T cell leukemic line Jurkat. This pkC activation is markedly prolonged when Jurkat cells are stimulated with immobilized rather than soluble CD3 antibodies. These studies suggest that activation of pkC plays a major role in T cell activation and that the activation of pkC is influenced by the form in which CD3 mAb is presented to T cells.\r"

  ".W": "These studies assess the roles of subpopulations of T lymphocytes in inducing and modulating resistance to Schistosoma mansoni. CDF rats were depleted of RT 7.1+ (anti-Pan-T), W3/25+ (anti-T helper/inducer), or OX8+ (anti-T suppressor) cells by the in vivo administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The development of parasites and immunity to challenge by S. mansoni were compared with results in undepleted normal and congenitally athymic rats. Discrete subpopulations of T lymphocytes were adoptively transferred to ascertain effects upon parasite development and the protective immune response. In vitro studies, involving utilizing cocultivation of cell subpopulations +/- cyclosporin A, were utilized to dissect mechanisms. Depletion of T lymphocytes by anti-RT7.1 mAb and anti-W3/25 mAb resulted in augmented initial worm development, suboptimal resistance, and decreased antibody and delayed-type hypersensitive reactivity directed against schistosome antigens. Depletion with OX8 mAb produced opposite effects. The adoptive transfer of T cell subpopulations produced concordant results with T cell regulation expressed B cell-dependent effector mechanisms. The coadoptive transfer of cells resulted in the suppression of resistance afforded by the W3/25+ cells by OX8+ cells, which could be augmented in vitro by cyclosporin A. Thus, protective immunity to S. mansoni in rats is regulated by discrete subpopulations of T lymphocytes. The findings suggest the possibility of selective immune regulation of resistance based on the manipulation of specific T cell subpopulation.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the clonal origin of SJL reticulum cell sarcoma (RCS), two-color cell membrane-staining and molecular biologic analyses were performed. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the SJL RCS consists of about 50 to 60% Thy-1-positive and 20 to 30% B220-positive cells and that the majority of the Thy-1-positive cells are L3T4-positive, whereas a few are Lyt-2-positive. In spite of this pleomorphic nature of SJL RCS shown by cell membrane analysis, when the immunoglobulin heavy chain J segment (JH) was used to probe the DNA obtained from the tumor, we observed clonal rearrangements of the gene. Results of the cell-sorting experiment combined with Southern hybridization using the JH gene probe confirmed that those clonally expanding cells are Ia and B220 antigen-positive. Furthermore, all tumors derived from a given mouse showed the same rearrangement pattern. However, no clonal rearrangement was observed when the DNA was probed with the T cell receptor beta-chain gene or with immunoglobulin kappa- or lambda-light chain genes. From these data, we conclude that SJL RCS is a tumor of B cells and that the neoplastic event takes place at an immature B cell stage.\r"

  ".U": "88009165\r", 
  ".W": "Mice homozygous for the lpr gene spontaneously develop massive lymphoproliferation and an associated lupus-like autoimmune disease. In addition, the total lymphoid organs from these mice express high levels of mRNA for the c-myb proto-oncogene. Since enhanced c-myb mRNA is normally observed in immature thymic lymphocytes but not normal peripheral T cells, this may be indicative of the abnormal maturation state of lpr T lymphocytes. To determine whether the abnormal Lyt-2-, L3T4- (double negative) T lymphocytes in lpr mice express high c-myb, we purified this population by complement-mediated lysis with anti-L3T4 and Lyt-2 antibody from B6/lpr lymph nodes. We found that increased c-myb mRNA is expressed by this double-negative subset. To assess whether the high level of c-myb correlated with the aberrant undifferentiated state of these cells, we examined the effects of T cell differentiation inducers, phorbol ester and calcium ionophore, on c-myb expression. We found that c-myb levels were depressed after phorbol ester and calcium ionophore treatment. Concomitantly, transcriptional activation of the interleukin 2 receptor gene and progression of these cells through the cell cycle were observed. Thus, in B6/lpr double-negative T cells, the regulation of c-myb, interleukin 2 receptor, and cell proliferation may be interrelated. A combination of Northern hybridization and nuclear run-on transcription assays revealed two levels at which c-myb can be regulated in the double-negative T cell subset. The gene is transcriptionally regulated in untreated cells, but on induction with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore, the gene is negatively regulated via post-transcriptional mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "88009168\r", 
  ".W": "Macrophage activation for tumor cell killing is a multistep pathway in which responsive macrophages interact sequentially with priming and triggering stimuli in the acquisition of full tumoricidal activity. Although this synergistic response of normal macrophages to sequential incubation with activation signals has been well established, characterization of the intermediate stages in this pathway has been difficult, due in large measure to the instability of the intermediate cell phenotypes. We have developed a model system for examination of macrophage-mediated tumor cell lysis, with the use of the murine macrophage tumor cell line RAW 264.7. These cells, like normal macrophages, exhibit a strict requirement for interaction with both interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma, the priming signal) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, the triggering signal) in the development of tumor cytolytic activity. In this system, the priming effects of IFN-gamma decay rapidly after withdrawal of this mediator and the cells become unresponsive to LPS triggering. We have recently observed that gamma-irradiation of the RAW 264.7 cells also results in development of a primed activation state for tumor cell killing. The effects of gamma-radiation on the RAW 264.7 cell line are strikingly similar to those resulting from incubation with IFN-gamma, with the exception that the irradiation-induced primed cell intermediate is stable and responsive to LPS triggering for at least 24 hr. Treatment with gamma-radiation also results in increased cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex-encoded class I antigens; however, class II antigen expression is not induced. Irradiation-induced development of the primed phenotype is not solely the result of cytostatic effects as treatment of the cells with a radiomimetic drug, mitomycin C, results in decreases in [3H]thymidine incorporation that are similar to those observed after irradiation, without concomitant development of cytolytic potential. In addition, priming by gamma-radiation does not appear to be mediated by the release of soluble autoregulatory factors. This alternate pathway for induction of the primed macrophage activation state should serve as a useful tool for identification of molecules important to the functional potential of primed cells, and for elucidation of the biochemical mechanisms of the priming event in tumoricidal activation.\r"

Serial samples of blood were assayed for bacterial concentration, levels of plasma endotoxin, arterial blood gases, and complete blood cell counts. Physiologic functions were monitored continuously. Although levels of bacteremia and endotoxemia were similar in all three groups, rabbits receiving PMB had significantly higher mean arterial blood pressure, blood pH, and bicarbonate concentrations than did control rabbits (P less than .05). Rabbits receiving NaD fared no better than controls. In this model, PMB moderates some of the deleterious effects of established, overwhelming gram-negative bacterial sepsis.\r"

Seventy-one percent of patients with paucibacillary disease and 85.5% of patients with multibacillary disease were positive for at least one of the three antibodies. The 15% of antibody-negative patients with multibacillary disease were mostly long-term-treated patients, with inactive disease by biopsy. There was excellent agreement between M. tuberculosis LAM and M. leprae LAM in detection of antibodies. Bacillary index and levels of both IgG and IgM antibodies to LAM were positively correlated when all patients were analyzed. When patients with a history of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) were analyzed separately, there was no correlation between IgM or IgG antibody to LAM and bacillary index, a result suggesting a possible role for LAM in the pathogenesis of ENL.\r"

Mucosal injury by chenodeoxycholate and its time sequence was assessed by using mannitol absorption and quantitative histology after 5, 15, 30, and 45 minutes of chenodeoxycholate perfusion. Forty-five-minute perfusion with chenodeoxycholate increased mannitol absorption from 0 to 0.9 nmol/min/cm, whereas prostaglandin pretreatment reduced this increase threefold (P less than 0.001). The increase in mannitol absorption coincided with progressive denudation of epithelial cells from intestinal villi. After 45 minutes exposure to chenodeoxycholate, an average of 50 micron of the cross-sectional surface of the villi tips was denuded of epithelial cells compared with only 25 micron denuded with prostaglandin pretreatment (P less than 0.01). These data indicate that topical administration of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 reduces both the functional and morphologic small intestinal mucosal injury caused by chenodeoxycholate.\r"

We have examined tau immunoreactivity in AD using the monoclonal antibody (MAb), 5E2, raised against human fetal tau. Four types of abnormalities were recognized by MAb 5E2, each having some counterpart in Bielschowsky silver impregnations: 1) NFT; 2) thickened neurites in SP; 3) diffuse perikaryal staining seen in some neurons apparently lacking NFT; and 4) a dispersed network of randomly oriented thickened neurites not clustered into discrete plaques but found in NFT- and SP-rich cerebral cortex. These four alterations could also be recognized using three different polyclonal antibodies which had strong tau immunoreactivity but were optimally shown by MAb 5E2. Our findings demonstrate the complexity of altered tau-immunoreactive neuronal elements and emphasize the widespread abnormality of microtubule-associated proteins in AD cortex.\r"

To characterize the time course and extent of recovery of perfusion and metabolism, we used positron emission tomography with 15O-labeled water and 11C-labeled palmitate to sequentially study six dogs after 2 hr of ischemia followed by reperfusion for 4 wk. Myocardial blood flow in the ischemic region increased from 15 +/- 8% of normal during coronary occlusion to 82 +/- 25% 1 hr after reperfusion. Despite maintained coronary patency documented angiographically, flow was reduced after 24 hr to 37 +/- 16% of normal. This decrease was temporary, with flow returning to 66 +/- 11%, 62 +/- 7%, and 64 +/- 18% of normal after 1, 2, and 4 wk of reperfusion, respectively. Uptake of 11C-labeled palmitate paralleled alterations in perfusion during ischemia and early reperfusion, averaging 32 +/- 15% of normal during ischemia, and 67 +/- 22% and 36 +/- 10% after 1 and 24 hr of reperfusion. After that, palmitate uptake was more variable. Flow and fatty acid uptake after 4 wk of reperfusion were not related to collateral flow during ischemia or the extent of initial reperfusion. However, uptake of palmitate 1 hr after reperfusion was a strong predictor of the uptake of palmitate 4 wk after reperfusion (r = 0.86, p less than 0.03). The results indicate that positron emission tomography with 15O-labeled water and 11C-labeled palmitate may be useful for assessing the success of recanalization in restoring nutritive perfusion and fatty acid metabolism and that the uptake of [11C]palmitate early after reperfusion predicts the ultimate salvage of myocardium.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed purified diets that contained iron at 12, 27 or 237 mg/kg. After 12 wk the lipid and fatty acid composition of plasma, erythrocytes and liver was analyzed. Linoleic acid in plasma phospholipids and triacylglycerols was higher, but arachidonic acid was lower in the group fed 12 mg/kg iron than in the groups fed 27 or 237 mg/kg iron. Liver fatty acid and lipid composition was not different between groups. In the group fed 237 mg/kg iron, plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerols were 150%, erythrocyte cholesterol was 137% and erythrocyte phospholipids were 148% of levels in the rats fed 27 mg/kg iron. The fatty acid data suggest a mild impairment in essential fatty acid metabolism in moderately iron-deficient rats. The lipid data suggest a significant alteration in the total lipid content of plasma and erythrocytes of iron-supplemented rats.\r"

  ".W": "Three experiments were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the growth-promoting capacity of alpha-keto analogs of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). Basal chemically defined diets were formulated to be singly deficient in the BCAA under study; analogs therefore were evaluated as sources of supplemental amino acid activity. Analogs of isoleucine tested included alpha-keto-beta-L-methylvalerate (L-KMV) as the Na salt (L-KMV-Na) and alpha-keto-beta-DL-methylvalerate (DL-KMV) as the Na (DL-KMV-Na), ornithine (DL-KMV-Orn) and lysine (DL-KMV-Lys) salts. Slope-ratio efficacy values were L-KMV-Na, 65%; DL-KMV-Na, 44%; DL-KMV-Orn, 41%; DL-KMV-Lys, 43%. Alloisoleucine accumulated in the plasma of rats fed all sources of KMV, but its concentration was three times greater when DL-KMV was fed than when L-KMV was fed. The analog of valine tested was alpha-ketoisovalerate as the ornithine (KIV-Orn) or lysine (KIV-Lys) salts. There was no significant difference in efficacy between salts (47 versus 44%, respectively). The analog of leucine, alpha-ketoisocaproate, was given as the ornithine (KIC-Orn), lysine (KIC-Lys) and histidine (KIC-His) salts with resulting efficacies of 50, 38 and 49%, respectively. Slope-ratio efficacies of KIC-Orn and KIC-His were statistically similar and efficacy of KIC-Lys was inferior to both KIC-Orn and KIC-His.\r"

After body temperature feedings, mean skin temperature fell by 0.2 degree C, but stomach and rectal temperatures did not change appreciably. The metabolic rate rose by 12% in the first hour, which was not significantly less than the rise after room temperature feeding. The heat required to warm the formula to body temperature did not result in a detectably greater rise in metabolic rate after cool feeding than after warm feeding. The effects of feed temperatures below room temperature were not studied, but it remains possible that cooler feedings might produce even greater body cooling and a greater thermogenic response.\r"

  ".W": "Ethanol was studied for its effects on electrophysiological properties of cultured skeletal myotubes prepared from fetal or neonatal rats. Intracellular recordings were made with KCl-filled (3 M) glass micropipettes from cells 7 to 9 days after plating. Ethanol produced a temperature-dependent, dose-related depolarization of the myotubes. Maximum depolarization of 15 mV was reached at a concentration of 217 mM at 37 degrees C; at 25 degrees C, ethanol caused hyperpolarization at low concentration (21.7 mM) and was without effect at higher concentrations (up to 435 mM). Of other alcohols examined, only propanol had a significant effect on transmembrane resting potential (Em). In the presence of ouabain, a specific Na-K pump inhibitor, ethanol had no effect on Em. Ethanol decreased the relation between Em and [K+]o. At 37 degrees C, spontaneously occurring action potentials were abolished completely by ethanol, but at 25 degrees C their frequency was reduced. Amplitude, overshoot, rates of rise and fall were all increased by ethanol (21.7 mM). We also found that ouabain-dependent 86Rb uptake was decreased by 217 mM ethanol at 37 degrees C and was without effect at 25 degrees C, and that this phenomenon was increased by 21.7 mM ethanol at the lower temperature. We conclude that ethanol effects on Em are exerted primarily via changes in activity and contribution of the Na-K pump to Em.\r"

In vivo, administration of pirprofen (2 mmol . kg-1 i.p.), 1 hr before that of [U-14C]palmitic acid, decreased by 70% the exhalation of [14C]CO2 during the next 6 hr. Administration of pirprofen (2 mmol . kg-1 i.p.), 1 hr before the measurement, decreased plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate by 60%, plasma acetoacetate by 30% and blood glucose by 40%. Administration of pirprofen (2 mmol . kg-1 i.p.) 6 hr before sacrifice, doubled hepatic triglycerides content and produced microvesicular steatosis of the liver. We conclude that pirprofen inhibits the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids in mice, thus explaining the microvesicular steatosis observed in mice and in some human subjects.\r"

  ".W": "ICI 147,798 is a novel compound which has both diuretic and beta adrenoceptor blocking properties in a single molecule. The natriuretic activity at 30 mg/kg p.o. was about 65% of the hydrochlorothiazide value at 10 mg/kg p.o. in saline-loaded rats; the corresponding kaliuretic activity was 42%. The natriuretic and the kaliuretic activity of ICI 147,798 in dogs were similar to that of hydrochlorothiazide over the doses 1 to 20 mg/kg p.o., although significantly less kaliuresis was obtained with ICI 147,798 at 1 mg/kg p.o. In the toad bladder preparation (analogous to the distal mammalian nephron), ICI 147,798 inhibited Na+ transport with mucosal and serosal IC50 values of 56 and 120 microM, respectively. ICI 147,798 inhibited isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in rats, cats, guinea pigs and dogs; these effects were associated with antagonism of isoproterenol vasodepressor responses. The pKB values of ICI 147,798 were 9.1 and 8.8 in isolated right atria and trachea of guinea pigs, respectively. ICI 147,798 did not exhibit local anesthetic activity in rabbit cornea and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity in catecholamine-depleted dogs and rats. Duration of beta blockade after a p.o. dose of 1 mg/kg in dogs followed the sequence: nadolol greater than ICI 147,798 greater than atenolol greater than timolol greater than propranolol. It is concluded that ICI 147,798 is a novel diuretic agent with nonselective beta blockade, and it appears to have the potential of a direct tubular action.\r"

Similar results were observed with ram seminal vesicle microsomes. Metabolism was inhibited by indomethacin, propylthiouracil and methimazole but not glutathione. Data are consistent with metabolism being catalyzed by the hydroperoxidase activity of prostaglandin H synthase. The product was identified by mass spectrometry as 3-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-pyrrolyl)pyridine. Addition of NADPH resulted in formation of a different aqueous soluble product and also an organic extractable product. NADPH-dependent products were inhibited by 2-[(2,4-dichloro-6-phenyl)phenoxy]ethylamine, suggesting mixed-function oxidase catalyzed metabolism. The organic soluble product was identified as cotinine. Cotinine formation was inhibited by glutathione. 3-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-pyrrolyl)Pyridine was identified in urine from rabbits administered nicotine and from a male cigarette smoker. The amount of peroxidatic product in urine from rabbit and humans was 15 and 6%, respectively, that observed for cotinine. Thus, peroxidation represents a new metabolic pathway for nicotine which involves the peroxidatic activity of prostaglandin H synthase.\r"

  ".W": "This paper characterizes the ability of rioprostil, a synthetic primary alcohol prostaglandin E1 analog, to inhibit gastric acid secretion and prevent experimentally induced gastric lesions in rats and dogs, and determines the selectivity (the separation in potency) for these effects. In 4-hr pylorus ligated rats, rioprostil inhibited gastric acid output when administered i.v., s.c., p.o. or intraduodenally, with ED50 values of 0.9, 1.8, 2.9 and 3.7 mg/kg, respectively. Rioprostil suppressed meal-stimulated acid output in Heidenhain pouch dogs and inhibited gastric acid output stimulated by tetragastrin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, betazole or bethanechol in gastric fistula dogs with ED50 values of 7, 10, 16 and 17 micrograms/kg p.o., respectively. These values in dogs were not significantly different from each other, suggesting that the mechanism of the antisecretory effect of rioprostil is similar regardless of the secretagogue used. Rioprostil prevented ethanol induced gastric lesions in rats (ED50 = 1.5 micrograms/kg p.o.; 12.0 micrograms/kg s.c.) after a 30-min pretreatment. The 8-fold difference in potency between the p.o. and s.c. routes may reflect a local component in the antilesion mechanism of rioprostil. In dogs, rioprostil inhibited aspirin-induced gastric lesions with a p.o. ED50 of 1.6 micrograms/kg. Maximum antilesion activity in dogs for cimetidine or ranitidine was less than 50%, whereas rioprostil inhibited lesion formation by 100% without the appearance of side effects. Oral antilesion selectivity of rioprostil in rats (antisecretory ED50/antilesion ED50) was nearly 2000-fold using the optimum pretreatment time (30 min), and was 12-fold when the pretreatment time (4 hr) was the same as the duration of the antisecretory assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88010628\r", 
  ".W": "In the presence of indomethacin, arachidonic acid relaxes precontracted rings of rat aorta only when the endothelium is intact. Arachidonate-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation is potentiated by superoxide dismutase. In contrast, linoleic acid (LA) contracts endothelium-intact and -denuded rings. Arachidonate is metabolized in endothelial cells by both cyclo-oxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase. Therefore, we determined the vasodilatory effect of 15-lipoxygenase products. The products generated by soybean lipoxygenase (SLO) from arachidonate in the bioassay bath relax precontracted, de-endothelialized ring segments of rat aorta. This relaxation is potentiated by superoxide dismutase and is more prominent when high concentrations of SLO are used. The main metabolites recovered from the bioassay bath were 5,15-dihydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 8,15-dihydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid. At lower concentrations of SLO the degree of relaxation is less and the major product is 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid. LA is metabolized by SLO to 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid. The relaxation induced by the incubation of LA with SLO in endothelium-denuded rings is less than that obtained with arachidonic acid. In endothelium-denuded rings that were precontracted with phenylephrine authentic 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid did not induce clear effect (at 40 microM 15-hydroperoxide caused relaxation, whereas at 15 microM induced small contraction) and 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid of LA induced contraction. Neither 5,15-dihydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid nor 8,15-dihydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (1-15 microM) induced a well defined relaxation. This study indicates that arachidonic acid is metabolized by SLO to a vasodilatory compound(s) that is possibly derived from 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid.\r"

  ".W": "The authors gave infusions of exogenous arachidonic acid (AA), exogenous phospholipase A2 (PLA2) or A23187 into the pulmonary circulation of isolated salt-perfused rabbit lungs. Exogenous PLA2 and A23187 are agents that release the AA that is usually in the lung (i.e., endogenous pulmonary AA). The exogenous AA or A23187 led to pulmonary cyclooxygenase enzyme conversion of exogenous and endogenous AA to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), as TXB2, and prostacyclin, as 6-keto-prostaglandin-F1 alpha, as well as to elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The elevations in PVR as well as the elevations in TXB2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin-F1 alpha were prevented by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitor, and the elevations in TXB2 and PVR but not the elevations in 6-keto-prostaglandin-F1 alpha were prevented by 1-benzylimidazole, a selective inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis. Maximum elevations in PVR occurred from conversion of AA to less than maximum levels of TXA2. Exogenous PLA2 led to release of endogenous AA with conversion to prostacyclin. However, such release of endogenous AA by exogenous PLA2 did not lead to conversion to TXA2 or to elevations in PVR. The authors conclude that elevations in PVR that depend on conversion of AA to TXA2 are limited by factors other than the amount of TXA2 or the amount of AA that is potentially available for such conversion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The binding properties of the putative M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine (PZ) to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) embedded in membranes and freed by solubilization with digitonin have been studied in the rat forebrain and heart. In the forebrain membranes, the k+1 and k-1 of [3H]PZ binding was 7.05 X 10(5) min-1 M-1 and 1.84 X 10(-3) min-1 (Kd = 3.34 nM), respectively, whereas those in heart membranes were estimated to be 1.21 X 10(5) min-1 M-1 and 7.46 X 10(-3) min-1 (Kd = 66 nM) by an indirect method. After solubilization, the kinetic parameters were determined as 3.17 X 10(5) min-1 M-1 and 2.23 X 10(-3) min-1 (Kd = 7.16 nM) in the forebrain and 2.41 X 10(5) min-1 M-1 and 1.41 X 10(-3) min-1 (Kd = 6.35 nM) in the heart. Similar dissociation constants were obtained from equilibrium saturation binding studies of [3H]PZ. Both high and low affinity binding sites for PZ were found in the forebrain membranes, whereas only one low affinity site was detected in the heart membranes. After solubilization, the inhibition curves in both tissues were better fitted to a one-site model with similar Ki values. The affinity of the agonist carbachol was decreased greatly in the heart and decreased slightly in the forebrain after solubilization to IC50 values that were similar in both tissues. Although 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate was able to reduce the affinity of carbachol for membrane bound mAChR and to increase slightly the binding of (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate it had no effect on ligand binding to the solubilized mAChR. The affinities of classic antagonists (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate and atropine were not altered significantly by solubilization. Our results suggest that several different factors appear to be involved in the association and dissociation processes of PZ binding to the putative M1 (in forebrain) and M2 (in heart) mAChR in membranes. Most of these factors were separated from the receptors by solubilization under our conditions.\r"

This approach may also apply to other categories of patients who have multiple variables associated with the clinical picture, treatment and outcome, and in whom the demonstration of treatment effectiveness requires longterm studies of large numbers of patients. Certain complications seen in patients with spinal cord injury including heterotopic ossification, joint changes, and dermal fibrosis, may provide models for the understanding of certain bone and collagen diseases.\r"

After a minimum followup of 3 months (mean 5.9 months) 2 patients (20 per cent) had passed successfully all of the stone fragments, while 3 (30 per cent) had passed more than half and 5 (50 per cent) had passed less than half of the fragments. Of the 8 patients with residual fragments only 3 had persistent symptoms indicating that symptom relief is not dependent on complete stone removal. The possibility of producing a satisfactory result (70 per cent free of symptoms) and the low morbidity of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy suggest that this treatment may be appropriate for calculi in caliceal diverticula.\r"

In addition, the same hormones were measured before and up to 24 months after orchiectomy in 14 age-matched, previously untreated patients also without metastases. In long-term estrogen-treated patients serum concentrations of testosterone found at 1, 12 and 24 months after cessation of estrogen did not differ significantly either from the value before estrogen withdrawal or from the corresponding values found in age-matched patients after orchiectomy. The concentrations of luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones increased significantly in the estrogen-treated patients after cessation of estrogen and in the age-matched patients after orchiectomy. However, luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones were significantly lower in the patients after estrogen treatment than in the age-matched patients after orchiectomy. During the study period only 1 patient from the estrogen-treated group had clinical progression and he died of prostatic carcinoma. We conclude that long-term estrogen treatment causes impairment of Leydig cell function in patients with prostatic carcinoma and, as a result, the serum testosterone concentrations do not increase when that treatment is discontinued.\r"

Human peripheral monocytes released a cytolytic factor which lysed T24 bladder cancer cells and a number of human tumor cells, but not normal lymphocytes or fibroblasts. After incubation of monocytes with bacillus Calmette-Guerin for 48 hr. in vitro, cytolysis of T24 cells was increased up to 56.7 +/- 4.1%. Treatment of monocytes with actinomycin D (an inhibitor of RNA transcription) reduced release of cytolytic factor from 27.3 +/- 5.7% cytolysis to 4.5 +/- 1.4% (p less than 0.05). The response to mitomycin C was different between lymphokines and monocyte cytolytic factor. The mouse monoclonal antibody against human recombinant tumor necrosis factor did not neutralize monocyte cytolytic factor. These results show that this monocyte cytolytic factor is distinct from lymphokines and tumor necrosis factor. The evidence that bacillus Calmette-Guerin increases release of monocyte cytolytic factor may be associated with anti-tumor activity of bacillus Calmette-Guerin in intravesical therapy for treatment of bladder cancer.\r"

In order to find out whether this detrimental influence is permanent in nature or can be avoided by therapeutic measures, and furthermore to quantify the damage, the following experiments were performed. Seventy-five rats were classified into the following five groups: I) testicular torsion persisting for eight hours; II) ipsilateral semicastration after torsion persisting for eight hours; III) semicastration; IV) sham operation as control; V) immunosuppression with azathioprine after torsion persisting for eight hours. The contralateral testes were removed two months later and perfused with fixative via the testicular artery. Stereologic techniques were employed to obtain quantitative morphologic data. Serum hormone levels were determined. The volume density of the contralateral germinal epithelium was not decreased two months after torsion for eight hours, torsion following by semicastration or torsion followed by immunosuppression. The same was true of the total volume of germinal epithelium per rat testis. The hormone levels remained essentially unchanged.\r"

The histological changes noted included severe generalized atrophy of the seminiferous tubules, prominent degeneration of the Sertoli cells, with ultimate total tubular hyalinization, partial Sertoli-cell-only syndrome in 50 per cent of the testes (number of germ cells less than or equal to 0.95 per tubule), and pronounced collagenization and fibrosis of the interstitium (50 per cent) with total atrophy of the Leydig cells in 92 per cent of the testes. These results show that the effect of prolonged high doses of buserelin in the majority of patients caused irreversible damage, particularly to spermatogenesis and the Sertoli cells, and thus to the intratesticular ultra-short loop. Therefore, when it is applied continuously in a high dose daily for a long period this drug does not appear to be suitable as a male contraceptive.\r"

The enteral diet was given at one-half strength for the first 3 days. A 10-hr constant infusion of [U-14C]phenylalanine tracer was used in four patients to measure aromatic amino acid (AA) turnover and rates of incorporation into various body proteins. Seven of the eight patients made a good clinical recovery, with reversal of encephalopathy within 3 days of dietary intervention. One became septicemic and deteriorated. While plasma bilirubin concentrations dropped, liver enzymes remained elevated. Mean nitrogen balance was negative at the beginning and positive at the end of the study, in both groups. Initial amino acid profiles demonstrated low plasma BCAA content and BCAA:AA ratios. Significant improvements occurred in the iv group by day 2 and in both groups by day 7. Isotope studies showed that, whereas aromatic amino acid oxidation remained unchanged, greater quantities were incorporated in whole body protein, albumin, transferrin, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulins.\r"

We investigated the serum lipoproteins in nine patients maintained on HTPN for 36 +/- 4 (mean +/- SEM) months. Fat emulsions were given twice a week as a source of essential fatty acids. Mean serum cholesterol 110 +/- 6.5 mg/dl, LDL-cholesterol 75 +/- 6 mg/dl, and HDL-cholesterol 29 +/- 1 mg/dl, were at or below the 5th percentile compared with age- and sex-matched Lipid Research Clinic controls. HDL-cholesterol to serum cholesterol ratio was in the normal range (0.25 +/- 0.30). The mean serum cholesterol did not rise, but the mean serum triglyceride rose significantly from 72 +/- 4 to 104 +/- 16 mg/dl (p less than 0.05) immediately after completion of TPN infusions with fat emulsions. There was a negative correlation between the length of HTPN therapy and the total serum cholesterol (r = 0.43, p less than 0.05). Thus, HTPN patients have markedly depressed concentrations of total serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol, but the ratio of HDL cholesterol to total serum cholesterol is in the normal range.\r"

HPN duration for patients with benign diseases was longer [357.12 days (range: 30-4,155 days)] than for cancer patients [93.54 days (range: 30-421 days)]. Under HPN, patients gained a good nutritional status with an increase of total protein (p less than 0.001) and serum albumin levels (p less than 0.001). Weight gain was also significant (p less than 0.001). The rehospitalization rate was low (7.8%), but it was higher when HPN lasted for more than 3 months (10.87% +/- 1.58%) compared with short-term HPN (5.69% +/- 1.25%). Metabolic complications were unusual, and rehospitalization was related to the oncological treatment and/or infectious complications. Therefore, ambulatory HPN is a nutritional support that can significantly improve the life of patients with alimentary failure. Moreover, HPN allows significant cost savings compared to the alternative of prolonged hospitalization.\r"

However, the presence of vitamin and mineral deficiency syndromes that normally would not have time to develop in the hospitalized patient receiving total parenteral nutrition has been reported in patients receiving HPN. This study entails a longitudinal survey of plasma concentrations of vitamins A, E, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, as well as the minerals zinc, copper, and selenium, in patients receiving HPN. Plasma samples from eight patients who had been on HPN for 1-92 months before the study began were obtained once a month over a 12-month period. The blood was drawn immediately before their evening infusion of TPN in order to approximate fasting plasma nutrient concentrations. Patient values were compared to fasting control values and to published norms. Values for vitamin A, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and zinc all were within the normal range, and there was no evidence of metabolic bone disease. Plasma vitamin E and copper concentrations exceeded the normal range for most of the 12-month period. Of all of the nutrients studied, only plasma selenium concentrations were consistently in the low-normal to below-normal range. Selenium levels in patients on HPN should be monitored regularly, and supplementation may be necessary if clinical conditions warrant.\r"

Ten months after the last cuff covering by skin flap, the catheter is safely fixed in place and currently employed for home TPN.\r"

  ".W": "Every year several million people sustain brain injury. The development of an optimal metabolic and nutritional support program for brain-injured patients relies on an understanding of the metabolic response and nutritional complications that occur with brain injury. Severely brain injured patients have increased serum and urine levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol. These patients also have increased oxygen consumption and urinary nitrogen excretion. This group has observed hypozincemia, hyperzincuria, increased serum C-reactive protein and copper concentrations, and hypoalbuminemia in nonsteroid-treated severely brain-injured patients. Experimental head injury produces interleukin-1 (IL-1) of brain origin. This cytokine mediates many of the aspects of the acute phase response, including all of the metabolic abnormalities reported by our group. IL-1, when administered intracerebroventricularly to experimental animals, appears to have enhanced biological activity compared to that administered systemically. Interleukin-1 activity has been found in significant amounts in the intraventricular fluid of head-injured patients. We suggest that IL-1 acts in concert with traditional stress hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol to produce the profound metabolic disturbances observed in the head-injured patient.\r"

Women with ovarian cancer reported significantly elevated frequency of consumption of meat [relative risk (RR) = 1.6 for greater than or equal to 7 vs. less than 4 portions/wk], ham (RR = 1.9 for greater than or equal to 4 vs. less than 2 portions/wk), and higher subjective scores of fat intake (RR = 2.1 for highest vs. lowest scores), particularly butter. In contrast, consumptions of fish, green vegetables, carrots, and wholemeal bread or pasta were less frequent in cases; the corresponding risk estimates for highest versus lowest frequencies ranged between 0.6 and 0.8. These results were not materially modified by adjustment for indicators of socioeconomic status, parity, and other identified determinants of ovarian cancer. No relation emerged between alcohol consumption and ovarian cancer risk. The present study provides interesting indications that help to explain the considerable variations in ovarian cancer rates in different populations and, if confirmed, could, in principle, have important public health implications. Due caution, however, is required in interpreting the present results because of the limitations of available information and of the uncertainties of other published material concerning diet and ovarian cancer.\r"

A total of 217 STS cases selected from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology were compared to 599 controls for Vietnam service, occupational and nonoccupational exposure to various chemicals, occupational history, medical history, and life-style (smoking, alcohol, coffee, etc.). Military service information was verified by a review of the patient's military personnel records. Other information was ascertained from a telephone interview with either subjects or their next of kin. Cases and controls were stratified on the basis of the hospital type (civilian, Veterans Administration, and military); the Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the odds ratio (OR), adjusted for the effects of the stratification variable, was calculated. Vietnam veterans in general did not have an increased risk of STS when compared to those men who had never been in Vietnam (OR, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-1.36). Subgroups of Vietnam veterans who had higher estimated opportunities for Agent Orange exposure seemed to be at greater risk of STSs when their counterparts in Vietnam were taken as a reference group. However, this risk was not statistically significant.\r"

These include the multistage, genetic view of Slaga, Furstenberger, and Marks; the multistage, genetic and/or epigenetic view of Parkinson; and the two-stage view of Yuspa and Hennings. With the use of the multievent model, a mathematical model for cancer that can incorporate cell proliferation phenomena, these tumor promotion mechanisms were modeled mathematically. It was found that the models had different predictions about the incidence of papillomas in initiator-promoter-initiator experiments and the incidence of carcinomas in initiator-promoter experiments with varying periods of tumor promotion. Upon analysis, existing data were shown to be in agreement with the Yuspa and Hennings two-stage model. The analysis also supported the view, formulated by Scribner and co-workers, that different types of initiated cells were created, some capable of transformation to carcinomas and some not. Phenomena determined by use of benign tumors as the end point may need to be demonstrated with the use of the carcinoma as the end point, prior to the acceptance of these phenomena being applicable to the human carcinogenic process.\r"

The neonatal model made use of the fact that cell replication persists in the liver for 3 weeks of postnatal life. Malnutrition during suckling was induced by adopting the techniques of Widdowson and McCance of increasing the litter size to 16. Following AFB1 administration, the malnourished animals were rehabilitated on a high-protein pellet diet given ad libitum. Preneoplastic lesions and neoplastic nodules were identified in the livers of the 2 groups. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) was detected in the sera by immunoprecipitation. The preneoplastic lesions appeared earlier, and their progression was faster in the malnourished group as compared to the well-fed animals. By 65 weeks following AFB1 exposure, 6 of 17 (35%) animals from the malnourished group showed neoplastic nodules, whereas no such nodules were observed in the animals from the well-fed group. Neoplastic nodules showed a variable pattern of enzyme activities. Under the electron microscope the changes were again more marked in the animals of the malnourished group as compared to those of the well-fed group. In the former group serum AFP was detected as early as 46 weeks, and by 55-65 weeks almost 50% of the animals from the same group showed positivity for serum AFP. None of the animals from the well-fed group showed any positivity for serum AFP throughout the study. This study thus indicates that preneoplastic lesions-neoplastic nodules are enhanced when cell replication and malnutrition coexist during AFB1-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.\r"

Animals received daily subcutaneous injections of the drug (1, 5, 10, 15, or 25 mg/kg/24 hr) for 21 days with maximal inhibition of bioprosthetic heart valve calcification at a dosage of 15 mg/kg/24 hr (calcium level of diphosphonate-treated bioprostheses 3.5 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml; calcium level of control bioprostheses, 161.2 +/- 5.0 micrograms/mg), but with irreversibly diminished bone and somatic growth. A dosage optimum was observed at 10 mg/kg/24 hr with significant inhibition of bioprosthetic heart valve calcification (at 21 days, the calcium level was 16.4 +/- 3.6 micrograms/mg) and an absence of adverse effects on epiphyseal development and overall growth. Bioprosthetic heart valves retrieved from animal receiving ethanehydroxydiphosphonate (15 mg/kg/24 hr) for only the first week after implantation had significantly more calcification after 21 days than did bioprostheses from animals treated for 2 or 3 weeks. Bioprostheses explanted after 110 days from animals receiving the drug (15 mg/kg/24 hr) for the first 3 weeks had calcification equivalent to that of untreated control rats. Diphosphonate (15 mg/kg/24 hr) was most efficacious when initiated within 48 hours of bioprosthesis implantation, but was totally ineffective if administered after 1 week. It is concluded that ethanehydroxydiphosphonate optimally prevents bioprosthesis calcification without significant adverse effects on epiphyseal development and overall somatic growth at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/24 hr in rat subdermal implants, but it must be administered by continuous daily injections beginning within 48 hours of the implantation; this approach should be pursued in further long-term circulatory experimental studies because of its possible clinical relevance.\r"

In the isolated perfused rat heart fitted with an intraventricular balloon, we recently observed a sustained contraction related to infusion of cardioplegic solution. In the same model, to record these contractions, we studied myocardial preservation by multidose bicarbonate-containing cardioplegic solutions in which first the calcium content and then the pH was varied. An acalcemic cardioplegic solution (Group 1) and the same solution with calcium provided by adding calcium chloride (Group 2) or blood (Group 3) were equilibrated with 100% oxygen. Ionized calcium concentrations were 0, 0.10 +/- 0.06, and 0.11 +/- 0.07 mmol/L and pH values were 8.74 +/- 0.07, 8.54 +/- 0.08, and 8.40 +/- 0.07, all highly alkaline. Hearts were arrested for 2 hours at 8 degrees +/- 2.5 degrees C and reperfused for 1 hour at 37 degrees C. At end-arrest, myocardial adenosine triphosphate was depleted in all three groups, significantly in Groups 2 and 3. In Group 1 the calcium paradox developed upon reperfusion, with contracture (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure = 60 +/- 7 mm Hg), creatine kinase release up to 620 +/- 134 U/L, a profound further decrease in adenosine triphosphate to 1.9 +/- 1.7 nmol/mg dry weight, and either greatly impaired or no functional recovery (17% +/- 10% of prearrest developed pressure). Three hearts in this group released creatine kinase during arrest and did not resume beating during reperfusion. In Groups 2 and 3, the calcium paradox did not occur; functional recovery was 61% +/- 4% and 71% +/- 9% at 5 minutes of reperfusion. In two additional groups (4 and 5), the pH of the acalcemic cardioplegic solution was decreased by equilibration with 2% and 5% carbon dioxide in oxygen to 7.53 +/- 0.03 and 7.11 +/- 0.02. Contractions during arrest were smaller than in Groups 1, 2, and 3; adenosine triphosphate was maintained during arrest; functional recovery was 101% +/- 3% and 96% +/- 4% at 5 minutes of reperfusion. We conclude that acalcemic solutions with carbon dioxide are superior to highly alkaline calcium-containing solutions. If oxygenation of cardioplegic solutions, of proved value, causes severe alkalinity, then calcium paradox may result even with hypothermia. This hazard is prevented by adding calcium or blood to the solution or carbon dioxide to the oxygen used for equilibration.\r"

  ".W": "In late 1984, 10 children in a small, rural town in Brazil had high fever associated with vomiting and abdominal pain. Within 12-48 h of the onset of fever, purpura developed associated with vascular collapse and peripheral necrosis. All 10 children died. Cerebrospinal fluid examinations did not suggest meningitis and, when done, tests were negative for Neisseria meningitidis. Other culture, serological, and necropsy examinations did not reveal a cause. Case-finding uncovered another cluster of similar illness in children in a second town and sporadic cases in five other cities. Two case-control studies demonstrated that children who became ill were significantly more likely than control children to have had conjunctivitis during the month before illness. This conjunctivitis was purulent, preceded the onset of more severe disease by 3-15 days, and had resolved before fever began. Although no conjunctival cultures were obtained from case-children, Haemophilus aegyptius was the most common pathogen isolated from other conjunctival cultures during the epidemic. This organism was also isolated from a non-aseptic skin scraping from 1 case child. A 25-megadalton plasmid distinguished the H aegyptius isolates epidemiologically associated with illness from other Brazilian conjunctival isolates. Brazilian purpuric fever is a newly recognized syndrome of epidemic purpura fulminans associated with antecedent purulent conjunctivitis, possibly caused by H aegyptius.\r"
