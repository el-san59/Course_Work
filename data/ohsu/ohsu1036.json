As of May, 1990, 285 of the studies had been analysed by the investigators, and 52% of these had been published. Studies with statistically significant results were more likely to be published than those finding no difference between the study groups (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.32; 95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.25-4.28). Studies with significant results were also more likely to lead to a greater number of publications and presentations and to be published in journals with a high citation impact factor. An increased likelihood of publication was also associated with a high rating by the investigator of the importance of the study results, and with increasing sample size. The tendency towards publication bias was greater with observational and laboratory-based experimental studies (OR = 3.79; 95% Cl = 1.47-9.76) than with randomised clinical trials (OR = 0.84; 95% Cl = 0.34-2.09). We have confirmed the presence of publication bias in a cohort of clinical research studies. These findings suggest that conclusions based only on a review of published data should be interpreted cautiously, especially for observational studies. Improved strategies are needed to identify the results of unpublished as well as published studies.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular dysfunction can be improved with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition started 1 week after myocardial infarction or later. To see whether earlier intervention may confer greater benefit, a double-blind study was carried out in which 100 patients with Q wave myocardial infarction, but without clinical heart failure, were randomly allocated treatment with captopril 50 mg twice daily or placebo starting 24-48 h after onset of symptoms. Left ventricular volumes were measured regularly during 3 months of treatment and after a 48 h withdrawal period by means of two-dimensional echocardiography. The placebo group showed significant increases in left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDVI) and end-systolic (LVESVI) volume indices, with the ejection fraction unchanged. By contrast, the captopril group showed a slight but not significant rise in LVEDVI and a significant reduction in LVESVI with ejection fraction increased significantly. At 3 months there was a 4.6% difference in the change in ejection fraction from baseline between the groups (p less than 0.0001). Most of the treatment benefit was evident at 1 month and there were no changes in left ventricular volumes after 48 h withdrawal of treatment at 3 months. Heart failure requiring treatment with frusemide developed in 7 patients in each group during the study period; 3 of these (1 captopril-treated, 2 placebo-treated) had to be withdrawn from the trial with severe heart failure requiring open treatment. Thus early treatment with captopril is effective in preventing the ventricular dilatation that can occur after Q wave myocardial infarction.\r"

To assess the relation between these factors, limiting dilution analysis was used to assess the number of EBV-carrying B cells in the circulation of Gambian children during and after acute malaria. Numbers of virus-carrying cells were five times higher in acute malaria patients and in UK patients with infectious mononucleosis than in convalescent malaria patients and in healthy control adults from the UK. Spontaneous outgrowth in limiting dilution cultures from acute malaria samples was inhibited by acyclovir, a viral DNA polymerase inhibitor. The mechanism of outgrowth, therefore, was virus release from the in-vivo infected cell, which led to infection and immortalisation of co-cultured normal B cells. The findings provide evidence that acute malaria is associated with an increase in the number of EBV-carrying B cells in the circulation. Because of this increase, there is a greater chance of a cytogenetic abnormality occurring in such a cell, with consequent evolution of Burkitt's lymphoma.\r"

The control group were 16 pregnant women with no history of abortion. Ultrasound examination at first follow-up appointment showed a living fetus in 23 pregnancies of women with RSA. 9 of these pregnancies ended in abortion; 14 continued to term as did all the pregnancies in the control group. Compared with controls, women with RSA had a lower (p less than 0.05) ratio of prostacyclin to thromboxane between weeks 4 and 7 of gestation and a lower (p less than 0.01) output of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha between weeks 8 and 11. Women whose pregnancies ended in abortion had higher (p less than 0.05) output of 2,3-dinor-TxB2 between weeks 4 and 7 of gestation and lower (p less than 0.01) excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha between weeks 8 and 11 compared with women whose pregnancies proceeded to term. We conclude that deficiency of vasodilatory prostacyclin may be a factor in habitual abortion.\r"

Pre-operative and postoperative functional evaluation is available for the 11 patients followed up for more than a month; at 1 to 3 months postoperatively there were increases in FVC (mean 2.0 litres pre-operatively to 2.7 litres postoperatively, p less than 0.001), in FEV1 (0.74 to 1.06 litres, p = 0.01), and in maximum exercise treadmill times (5.4 min to 8.0 min, p less than 0.01). Postoperative air leaks lasted a mean of 13 days and usually resolved spontaneously. Other complications were bleeding (1 patient) and unilateral acute lung injury (1 patient). These results suggest that selected patients with diffuse emphysema and pulmonary bullae may benefit from thoracoscopic carbon dioxide laser ablation.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the importance of microsporidiosis of the small intestine in the pathogenesis of chronic diarrhoea in HIV-1-infected individuals, duodenal biopsy samples from the following three patient groups were prospectively evaluated for bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens by standard methods, and for microsporidia by light microscopy: 55 consecutive HIV-1-antibody-positive subjects with unexplained diarrhoea of at least 3 weeks duration (group A); 38 HIV-1-seropositive subjects without diarrhoea (group B) who consecutively underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for various reasons; and 7 patients without known risk factors for HIV infection with chronic unexplained diarrhoea (group C). In groups A and B most subjects had had previous AIDS-defining opportunistic infections and the median peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte count was less than 0.1 x 10(9)/l. Microsporidia were detected as the single pathogen in 15 of the group A compared with 1 (in whom diarrhoea subsequently developed) of the group B patients (p = 0.001) and none of the group C patients. With the exception of 4 of the group A patients, no other intestinal pathogens were identified in any of the patients. The median peripheral blood CD4 count was significantly lower in patients with detectable microsporidia than in those without microsporidiosis (0.03 x 10(9)/l vs 0.06 x 10(9)/l; p = 0.03); in all patients with microsporidiosis, the CD4 count was equal to or less than 0.1 x 10(9)/l. 13 patients with microsporidiosis were treated with metronidazole, in 10 of whom treatment led to a substantial improvement or disappearance of diarrhoea within days of starting therapy, but did not result in eradication of the parasite in the 5 patients who underwent repeat biopsy. The findings suggest that small-intestinal microsporidiosis is an important cause of chronic unexplained diarrhoea in HIV-1-infected individuals with pronounced cellular immune deficiency. This infection should therefore be added to the list of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections.\r"

Exercise-induced ischaemia may cause a reversible fall in cardiac output that sometimes leads to reflex vasoconstriction and a rise in DBP before a fall in systolic blood pressure or ECG evidence of ST segment depression. An abnormal DBP response to exercise may identify some patients at high risk of myocardial infarction who might otherwise have false-negative exercise tests.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Phenylketonuria is a metabolic disorder that results from a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Its clinical phenotype varies widely, and to date more than 10 mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene have been identified in persons with the disorder. We attempted to relate the clinical phenotype of patients to their genotype. METHODS. We studied 258 patients with phenylketonuria from Denmark and Germany for the presence of eight mutations previously found in patients from these countries. The in vitro activity of the enzymes associated with these mutations was determined by expression analysis in heterologous mammalian cells. The level of activity was then used to predict the in vivo level of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in patients with various combinations of mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles. RESULTS. The eight mutations involved 64 percent of all mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles in the patients. Expression analysis showed that these mutant enzymes produced from 0 to 50 percent of normal enzyme activity. The predicted level of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity correlated strongly with the pretreatment serum level of phenylalanine (r = 0.91, P less than 0.001 in the Danish patients and r = 0.74, P less than 0.001 in the German patients), phenylalanine tolerance in the Danish patients (r = 0.84, P less than 0.001), and the serum phenylalanine level measured after standardized oral protein loading in the German patients (r = 0.84, P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that there is a molecular basis for phenotypic heterogeneity in phenylketonuria. The establishment of genotype will therefore aid in the prediction of biochemical and clinical phenotypes in patients with this disease.\r"

  ".U": "91194729\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although previous investigations have suggested that 24 hours is required to exclude acute myocardial infarction in patients who are admitted to a coronary care unit for the evaluation of acute chest pain, we hypothesized that a 12-hour period might be adequate for patients with a low probability of infarction at the time of admission. METHODS. Using a Bayesian model, we developed a strategy to identify candidates for a shorter period of observation from an analysis of a derivation set of 976 patients with acute chest pain who were admitted to three teaching and four community hospitals. In the derivation set, patients whose clinical characteristics in the emergency room predicted a low (less than or equal to 7 percent) probability of myocardial infarction had only a 0.4 percent risk of infarction if they had neither abnormal levels of cardiac enzymes nor recurrent ischemic pain during the first 12 hours of hospitalization. In an independent testing set of 2684 patients from the seven hospitals, 957 admitted patients (36 percent) were classified as candidates for this 12-hour period of observation according to a previously published multivariate algorithm. Few of these patients were actually transferred from a monitored setting at 12 hours. RESULTS. Of the 771 candidates for a 12-hour period of observation who did not have enzyme abnormalities or recurrent pain during the first 12 hours, 4 (0.5 percent) were subsequently found to have acute myocardial infarction, and only 3 (0.4 percent) died after primary cardiac arrests, all of which occurred three to five days after admission. Rates of other major cardiovascular complications were low in the patients who might have been transferred from the coronary care unit after 12 hours with this strategy. In patients with a higher initial risk of infarction, the standard strategy of 24-hour observation identified all but 11 of 739 acute myocardial infarctions (1 percent). CONCLUSIONS. Emergency room clinical data can be used to identify a large subgroup of patients for whom a 12-hour period of observation is normally sufficient to exclude acute myocardial infarction. Patient-specific evaluation and treatment can then proceed without the restrictions imposed by \"rule-out\" protocols for myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. To define the risk factors associated with neonatal acquisition of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, we prospectively obtained HSV cultures from the cervix and external genitalia of 15,923 pregnant women in early labor who were without symptoms or signs of genital HSV infection. Follow-up of the women with positive cultures for HSV and their HSV-exposed infants included serologic tests and serial cultures for HSV. RESULTS. HSV was isolated from 56 of the women (0.35 percent), 18 of whom (35 percent) had serologic evidence of a recently acquired, subclinical first episode of genital HSV infection, and 34 of whom (65 percent) had reactivation of HSV. Neonatal HSV developed in 6 of 18 infants (33 percent) born to the women with a first episode of genital HSV, and in 1 of 34 infants (3 percent) born to the women with reactivation of HSV (P less than 0.01); neonatal HSV also occurred in three of the infants born to the 15,867 women with negative cultures. Neonatal HSV-2 occurred in 1 of 4 infants born to mothers seronegative at delivery for both HSV-1 and HSV-2, in 4 of 12 infants exposed to HSV-2 whose mothers had only HSV-1 antibodies at delivery, and in none of the infants born to 31 women who were HSV-2-seropositive. An increased risk of neonatal HSV was associated with exposure to viral shedding from the cervix and the use of fetal-scalp electrodes. CONCLUSIONS: Of the asymptomatic women who shed HSV in early labor, about a third have recently acquired genital HSV, and their infants are 10 times more likely to have neonatal HSV than those of women with asymptomatic reactivation of HSV. The presence of maternal antibodies specific to HSV-2 but not HSV-1 appears to reduce the neonatal transmission of HSV-2. Further studies are necessary to determine whether screening and prophylactic treatment are warranted for infants of HSV-2-seronegative mothers who shed HSV-1 or HSV-2 in early labor.\r"

Mice heterozygous at the hox-1.5 locus appear normal, whereas hox-1.5-/hox-1.5- mice die at or shortly after birth. These homozygotes are athymic, aparathyroid, have reduced thyroid and submaxillary tissue and exhibit a wide range of throat abnormalities. In addition, they often feature defects of the heart and arteries as well as craniofacial abnormalities. These deficiencies are remarkably similar to the pathology of the human congenital disorder DiGeorge's syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that, among the many visual areas of the human brain, there might be one set of spatial maps specialized for 'near' (peripersonal) and another for 'far' (extrapersonal) space. A distinction between 'grasping distance' and 'walking distance', or between a 'reaching field' and a pointing or throwing field has commonly been made. Evidence for such a division has been found in monkeys. Unilateral ablation of the frontal eye field (area 8) produces a more prominent inattention (or 'neglect') for objects in contralesional far space than in near space; by contrast, unilateral ablation of frontal area 6, which receives direct projections from area 7b (the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobules) results in inattention to visual stimuli limited to contralesional near space. Despite predictions that comparable dissociations should be found in man, there has been no convincing evidence. We report here such evidence in a patient with a unilateral right hemisphere stroke. Within peripersonal space, he showed severe left visuo-spatial neglect on conventional tests, including the highly sensitive task of line bisection. When line bisection was performed in extrapersonal space, neglect was abolished or attenuated.\r"

We have now investigated whether nerve growth factor (NGF) has a physiological role in the development of this diversity. We gave antisera against NGF to rats from postnatal day 1 (PND 1) to adulthood (5 weeks). We found a virtually complete depletion of high threshold mechanoreceptors conducting in the A delta range (2-13 ms-1) in the sural nerve. This afferent type, normally present in large numbers, appeared to have been replaced by D-hair afferents, sensitive mechanoreceptors which normally are relatively rare. NGF deprivation had this effect only in early postnatal life; treatment from postnatal day 14 to adulthood had no effect. We conclude that the presence of NGF postnatally in skin is necessary for the proper phenotypic development of A delta cutaneous nociceptors.\r"

Memory B-cell differentiation is characterized by somatic hypermutation in antibody variable region genes (V) and selection of B cells expressing high-affinity variants of this antigen receptor. Despite our current understanding of B-cell memory, the origin of memory B cells and the regulation of their differentiation remain elusive. This is largely due to the difficulties in observing and purifying this minor component of the immunized spleen. Further, molecular characterization of memory B cells requires hybridoma formation which restricts analyses to only those clones capable of fusion and does not allow isolation of cells in a normal physiological state. We have therefore developed a unique system which allows isolation and unambiguous enumeration of IgG1+ memory B cells, based on six-parameter flow cytometry, secretion of antibody in clonal cultures and analysis of clonally expressed V genes using the polymerase chain reaction. Here we report that single IgG1+ antigen-binding B cells from an early secondary immune response proliferate in lipopolysaccharide-driven microcultures and produce antigen-specific IgG1 antibodies. Individual B-cell clones in these cultures express somatically mutated heavy chain V genes, confirming their designation as memory B cells. Although isolated memory B cells undergo extensive proliferation in vitro, V gene sequence analysis of their individual progeny shows that further hypermutation does not occur.\r"

Because CD4+ cells help to coordinate efficient immune responses, some of the defects in the immune function in advanced cases of AIDS may be explained by the disappearance of these cells. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms used by HIV to induce the reduction of CD4+ cells is important. Here we use a Moloney murine leukaemia virus-based retroviral vector in order to express the nef gene of HIV-1 in three lymphocytic cell lines expressing CD4. In all cases we find that cell-surface CD4 expression is inversely related to nef expression. However, nef does not alter steady-state levels of CD4 RNA or CD4 protein. Also, nef can downregulate a CD4 triple mutant (Ser----Ala) that is neither phosphorylated nor down-regulated by phorbol esters, indicating that nef is acting by a different mechanism.\r"

We now report that a cloned human placental PRAD1 complementary DNA encodes a protein of 295 amino acids with sequence similarities to the cyclins. Cyclins can form a complex with and activate p34cdc2 protein kinase, thereby regulating progress through the cell cycle. PRAD 1 messenger RNA levels vary dramatically across the cell cycle in HeLa cells. Addition of the PRAD1 protein to interphase clam embryo lysates containing inactive p34cdc2 kinase and lacking endogenous cyclins allows it to be isolated using beads bearing p13suc1, a yeast protein that binds cdc2 and related kinases with high affinity and coprecipitates kinase-associated proteins. Addition of PRAD1 also induces phosphorylation of histone H1, a preferred substrate of cdc2. These data suggest that PRAD1 encodes a novel cyclin whose overexpression may play an important part in the development of various tumours with abnormalities in 11q13.\r"

Suspicion that subtle operatives, not reflected in morbidity and mortality rates, might be present inspired the study presented here. Three hundred fifty-two cesarean operations were done at Huron Road Hospital in the years 1952-1954. Examination of family records identified 97 probands delivered by cesarean after prolonged active labor before or during that period. Research efforts yielded 54 cases that were free of complications and had full historic data for both proband and sibling(s) of the same parentage, totaling 122 children. The intelligence quotient (IQ) scores of these families compared with that of the proband undergoing successive hours of labor suggested a detrimental effect of increasing length of trial labor. Statistical analyses of the 30 families in which the probands' trial labors exceeded 12 hours support that notion, as the probands had significantly lower IQ scores than their siblings born by elective cesarean with no labor (P = .006 to P less than .001). Probands had the lowest IQ scores in their families significantly more often (P less than .025) than could be expected to occur randomly. A similar pattern of school success occurred within the families.\r"

Sixty-two others received a traditional protocol, with oxytocin increased every 20 minutes as required. Both groups had amniotomy when deemed safe and feasible. Oxytocin was adjusted for uterine hyperstimulation or abnormal fetal heart rate patterns in 29 and 58% of low-dose and traditional protocol subjects, respectively (P less than .001, odds ratio 3.6). No significant increase in time to delivery was seen with low-dose oxytocin infusion. Cesarean delivery and cesareans for fetal distress were more frequent in the traditional protocol group. This study demonstrates that a continuous low-dose protocol for oxytocin induction of labor is effective in establishing active labor and achieving vaginal delivery in women with both ripe and unripe cervices. It is also associated with fewer episodes of uterine hyperstimulation requiring adjustments of oxytocin infusion than is the traditional protocol of this institution.\r"

The cesarean delivery rate in the oxytocin group was 14.9%, compared with 19.1% in the PG group (not significantly different). All seven cesareans in the oxytocin group and seven of nine in the PG group were for failed stimulation of labor. Neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit were similar in the two groups. The incidence of maternal and neonatal infection was small and was not different in the two groups.

Chorioamnionitis with an associated rise in prostaglandins (PGs) is thought to be one of the factors responsible for the onset of preterm labor. In this study, 52 placentas and membranes from gestations of 35 weeks' or fewer were collected. Tissue samples of membranes and placentas were incubated in pseudoamniotic fluid, and the levels of PGs and leukotriene B4 were assayed. Swallowed amniotic fluid aspirated from the infants' stomachs was analyzed for PGs and examined microscopically for the presence of degenerate neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pus cells) and bacterial organisms. Prostaglandins E and F and leukotriene B4 production were significantly higher in the membranes and placentas with chorioamnionitis than in those without. Although the comparison of PG levels in the gastric fluid of infants with and without chorioamnionitis did not reach statistical significance, there was a trend toward higher levels of PGs with chorioamnionitis. Prostaglandin E levels from membranes and placentas and PGF from placentas were significantly elevated in the gastric fluid of infants with pus cells and organisms. These findings support the hypothesis that chorioamnionitis may initiate preterm labor.\r"

There was no observed effect on newborn serum electrolyte levels with amnioinfusion, nor was there any apparent benefit of infusion of warmed saline compared with room-temperature saline. In contrast to premature gestations with oligohydramnios, prophylactic amnioinfusion was not associated with a significant improvement in mean umbilical arterial and venous pH or a significant decrease in cesarean delivery for fetal distress (P = .09).

We prospectively measured urinary calcium excretion in 103 consecutive nulliparous women at risk for preeclampsia and presenting for prenatal care before 24 weeks' gestation. Serial 24-hour urine specimens were obtained at 10-24 weeks, 25-32 weeks, and 33 weeks to term. After delivery, the charts were reviewed for the presence of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension. At the first collection, patients who later developed preeclampsia excreted less urinary calcium (169 +/- 30 mg/24 hours; mean +/- standard error of the mean) than those who remained normotensive (298 +/- 15 mg/24 hours) (P less than .05); this reduction persisted throughout gestation. Using a receiver operator curve, we calculated a predictive threshold calcium value for hypertension of 195 mg/24 hours. The difference in the incidence of preeclampsia between pregnant women with calcium excretion values at or below 195 mg/24 hours (87%, 95% confidence interval 52-98%) and those with values above that level (2%, confidence interval 0.3-8%) was highly significant (Fisher exact test, P less than .0001). The 95% lower limit of relative risk for preeclampsia in patients with a calcium excretion equal to or below 195 mg/24 hours in the first collection was 9.4. These observations suggest a pathophysiologic role for altered urinary calcium excretion in women with preeclampsia that may contribute to the early identification of patients at risk for this disease.\r"

Similarly, urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) excretion was 2.9 +/- 1.4 mumol/24 hours in the preeclamptics, 5.1 +/- 1.7 mumol/24 hours in the chronic hypertensives, and 4.6 +/- 1.3 mumol/24 hours in the normotensive group (P less than .05). These data suggest that the mechanism of hypocalciuria in preeclampsia is independent of the PTH-calcitriol axis.

The ELISA assay for total fibrin(ogen) degradation products was the most sensitive test, but was less specific than D-dimer latex. Eleven of the 35 preeclamptic women developed HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme, and low platelet counts). Positive tests were as common in the 11 preeclamptic women who developed the syndrome as in the 24 who did not. These results suggest that fibrinolytic disorders are secondary pathophysiologic events in the course of preeclampsia, but further studies with a larger number of patients are needed.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have presented conflicting evidence on the association between intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and placenta previa, with some groups reporting rates of IUGR as high as 16-19%. However, most of these studies failed to include a control population, included patients with other factors known to be associated with IUGR (eg, chronic hypertension, fetal anomalies, pregnancy-induced hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, etc), and/or did not confirm the patient's estimated gestational age. During the study period of January 1, 1980 through June 30, 1990, 54,969 deliveries occurred at the three affiliated hospitals of the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Division of the University of Connecticut Health Center. Review of the delivery records revealed 179 singleton pregnancies with documented placenta previa and without the above exclusion factors. One hundred seventy-one of these 179 study patients were compared with 171 women without placenta previa matched for confirmed gestational age, race, parity, and fetal sex. The incidence of small for gestational age (SGA) infants was 4.1% (seven of 171) in the study group and 5.8% (ten of 171) in the control group. Mean birth weights were 2559 and 2476 g, respectively. Neither difference was statistically significant. These results suggest that the prenatal diagnosis of an SGA fetus in a pregnancy complicated by placenta previa should not simply be attributed to abnormal placental implantation. Furthermore, routine ultrasonic examinations for growth in pregnancies complicated by placenta previa are not indicated.\r"

A retrospective review of sexual assault victims in Dallas County from 1983-1988 revealed that 114 of 5734 (2%) were pregnant. There were 0.55 and 0.75 gravid sexual assault victims per 1000 deliveries for Dallas County and Parkland Memorial Hospital, respectively. The purposes of this study were to examine patient demographics, forensic evidence and patterns of injury in pregnant victims compared with 114 matched nonpregnant sexual assault victims, and to compare pregnancy outcome with that of the Parkland Memorial Hospital obstetric population. The typical victim was a black, parous gravida in her twenties at a mean gestational age of 15 weeks, without previous prenatal care. Vulvar (95%), oral (27%), and anal (6%) penetration were reported with similar frequency in both groups. The detection of whole and motile sperm from the vaginal specimens was similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Physical trauma was more common in nonpregnant victims (63 versus 43%; P less than .004), especially genital trauma (21 versus 5%; P less than .001). Injury was more common to the head and neck or extremities than to the abdomen, chest, or back in both groups. There was no difference in the pattern of trauma by gestational age, but there were no truncal injuries in women at 20 weeks' gestation or greater. There were no spontaneous abortions or deliveries within 4 weeks of the assault, but low birth weight delivery (24%) and preterm delivery (16%) were common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients eligible for the study had at least a two-degree discrepancy, eg, CIN III cytology and CIN I or less on colposcopic biopsies, or CIN II cytology with biopsies showing no dysplasia. Of the 786 records reviewed, 87 (11.1%) had such a discrepancy. Twelve of 87 patients (13.8%) were pregnant and ten of 87 (11.5%) failed to return after their initial colposcopic evaluation, leaving 65 patients in the study group. Of these, 20 of 65 (30.8%) were treated medically, nine (13.8%) had cryotherapy, and 36 (55.4%) underwent diagnostic cervical conization. Of patients undergoing cervical conization, three had microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix. Following medical therapy, only two of 20 patients (10%) had negative cytology, two (10%) had CIN I, five (25%) received additional therapy, and 11 (55%) were lost to follow-up. Seven patients did not return for follow-up Papanicolaou smear after medical treatment, and four did not return after their initial posttreatment Papanicolaou smear revealed persistent dysplasia. Of the nine patients treated with cryotherapy, six (66.7%) had a negative Papanicolaou smear at the time of their initial follow-up. The results of this study emphasize the importance of proceeding with diagnostic or therapeutic conization if a two-stage or greater discrepancy exists between the colposcopically directed biopsies and the cervical cytology. The risk of not diagnosing a microinvasive or invasive cervical carcinoma far outweighs the risk of conization.\r"

We conclude that short-term and long-term cefoxitin prophylaxis are equally effective for the prevention of post-operative surgical-site-related infections after radical hysterectomy.\r"

Seventy-two women were enrolled and, using a randomized, computer-generated list, assigned to receive either active drug or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Patients were instructed to apply the medication to their external warts twice each day for 3 consecutive days, followed by 4 days without treatment. This cycle was repeated at weekly intervals for a maximum of 4 weeks (and a minimum of 2 weeks). Patients were evaluated weekly for the first month and then at weeks 6 and 10. The number of warts present was recorded and the overall improvement was assessed. The treated area was examined, the patients were questioned about any adverse effects, and standard hematologic/biochemical studies were conducted. The final results showed that podofilox cleared 74% of the total wart count, compared with an 18% regression in the placebo group (P less than .001). The investigators' assessments of improvement correctly distinguished active drug from placebo at every observation point. Local untoward effects were minor and transient. There was no evidence of systemic effects. It is concluded that patient-applied podofilox is a safe and effective therapy for genital condylomata in women. When available, this drug will simplify the treatment of genital warts by providing a patient-applied alternative therapy.\r"

In the standard-approach group, organic causes of pelvic pain were excluded first and diagnostic laparoscopy was routinely performed. If no somatic cause could be found, attention was given to other causes such as psychological disturbances. In the second group an integrated approach was chosen. From the beginning equal attention was devoted to somatic, psychological, dietary, environmental, and physiotherapeutic factors. In this group, laparoscopy was not routinely performed. Both groups were similar with respect to clinical characteristics of the patients and the severity of their pain as assessed by various pain parameters. Postcoital pain was reported by 27% of the patients. Twenty percent of the patients had had negative sexual experiences such as childhood sexual abuse or rape. Evaluation of the pain 1 year after the institution of treatment revealed that the integrated approach improved pelvic pain significantly more often than the standard approach for three out of four pain parameters (P less than .01). Laparoscopy played no important role in the treatment of pelvic pain. It is concluded that equal attention to both organic and other causative factors from the beginning of therapy is more likely to result in a reduction of pelvic pain than is a standard approach.\r"

Methotrexate and citrovorum were given on alternating days until the hCG titer had decreased by 15% on 2 consecutive days. The patients ranged in age from 16-40 years, gravidity from 1-8, and parity from 0-5. Twenty-three patients had a previous ectopic pregnancy. Of the 100 patients, 96 (96%) received methotrexate/citrovorum as primary therapy and four (4%) were treated for persistent hCG titers after a conservative surgical procedure. The tubal pregnancies of patient nos. 1-50 were confirmed by laparoscopy, whereas patient nos. 51-100 were diagnosed according to a nonlaparoscopic algorithm. Four patients of 100 failed medical therapy and required surgery. Of these, one had an ectopic pregnancy with cardiac activity, one ruptured after intercourse, and the remaining two cases had no specific identifiable risk factors. Of the ectopic pregnancies with cardiac activity, 80% were successfully treated. Five patients (5%) had methotrexate-related side effects, all after the fourth dose, but none required treatment for these side effects. Hysterosalpingograms done on 58 patients subsequently demonstrated tubal patency in 84.5% on the involved side. To date, 37 pregnancies have occurred in this group, of which 31 (89.2%) were intrauterine and four (10.8%) were recurrent ectopic pregnancies. We conclude that methotrexate/citrovorum is safe, effective, and helps to preserve reproductive performance when used as primary therapy for unruptured ectopic pregnancy and for treatment of persistent disease following a conservative surgical procedure.\r"

The vessels were dissected from biopsy specimens obtained during term cesareans and mounted in organ baths. Hydralazine failed to inhibit responses to any of the agonists tested in the fetal and maternal arteries. Labetalol and prazosin decreased responses to noradrenaline but did not affect contractions induced by the other agonists in maternal arteries. In fetal arteries, which did not respond to noradrenaline, no effects of labetalol and prazosin were found. Nitrendipine inhibited responses to all the agonists tested in maternal arteries. In fetal preparations, the drug decreased responses to K+ and PGF2 alpha but did not affect contractions induced by angiotensin II. Vasodilator drugs applied for treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension show differential effects on human maternal and fetal uteroplacental arteries, depending on their mode of action and the agonists responsible for the contractile activation in these vessels.\r"

Circular cervical tissue strips were mounted in organ baths and isometric tension was recorded. The mean (+/- SEM) maximal mechanical responses induced at the length of optimal mechanical performance by K+ (124 mmol/L) equaled 0.16 +/- 0.05 mN/mm2 in the distal cervix and 0.84 +/- 0.47 mN/mm2 in the proximal cervix, as compared with 4.85 +/- 1.0 mN/mm2 in tissues from the isthmus and 6.50 +/- 1.4 mN/mm2 in the fundus. The passive biomechanical properties were analyzed by a materials-testing machine. No significant differences were found between tissues from the distal and proximal cervix or between circular and longitudinal preparations. Tensile strength equaled 1.5-1.7 N/mm2, ie, 10(4)-fold the maximal muscular contractile ability. The extensibility was 0.63-0.76 and the stress-relaxation was 41-48%. The hydroxyproline concentration was 22.5 micrograms/mg wet weight in the distal cervix and 21.6 micrograms/mg in the proximal cervix, as compared with 16.6 micrograms/mg in the isthmus and 12.6 micrograms/mg in the fundus. A method for analysis of the biomechanical properties of the human cervix was designed, and from the measurements obtained it may be concluded that the passive biomechanical strength of the cervix markedly exceeds the active muscular contractile ability. This may be explained by a high collagen concentration and a low content of smooth muscle in the cervical tissue.\r"

The terminology for squamous epithelial lesions includes the following categories: 1) atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; 2) squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), which encompasses the spectrum of squamous cell carcinoma precursors, divided into low-grade SIL (human papillomavirus [HPV]-associated cellular changes, mild dysplasia, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] I) and high-grade SIL (moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ and CIN II and III); and 3) squamous cell carcinoma. The rationale for including HPV-related changes (koilocytosis) with CIN I within low-grade SIL is based on the morphologic, behavioral, and virologic similarity of these two lesions, which precludes their separation in a consistent and reliable fashion. For the same reasons, CIN II and III lesions have been combined within the category of high-grade SIL. The term \"atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance\" is used for cytologic findings that do not fulfill the criteria for defined benign reactive changes or SIL. Therefore, this term is more restricted in usage as compared with the wide range of interpretations previously ascribed to \"atypia\" or \"inflammatory atypia.\"\r"

The Panel noted the need for attention not only to the mother and fetus, but also to the infant and family. Besides traditional medical care concerns, the importance of psychosocial and environmental patient and family needs was emphasized. The Panel felt that the addition of the pre-conception visit to routine prenatal care made care more effective. Suggestions as to visit timing and content were made. The Panel noted the need for further understanding of many of the activities performed routinely in prenatal care.\r"

Data regarding the effectiveness of ultrasonography in detecting early-stage ovarian cancer are reviewed. Ultrasonography is more sensitive than pelvic examination in detecting ovarian abnormalities but lacks specificity in distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian lesions. Combined with serum CA 125 levels, ultrasonography may provide an effective screening tool, although cost-effectiveness has not been demonstrated and its effectiveness in reducing mortality from ovarian cancer has not been completely evaluated. Guidelines are presented for the use of ultrasonography in evaluating the postmenopausal ovary.\r"

Individual fetal growth curve standards for head and abdominal circumferences, femur diaphysis length, and weight were determined from the data of two scans obtained before 26.1 weeks' gestation and separated by an interval of at least 5 weeks. Projected crown-heel lengths were calculated from projected femur diaphysis length values. Comparisons between actual and predicted birth characteristics were expressed by the Growth Potential Realization Index (GPRI) and Neonatal Growth Assessment Score (NGAS). Excessive growth at birth was seen in almost all cases as indicated by high GPRI for weight and abdominal circumference and abnormal NGAS values. In eight of the 33 patients who delivered after 38 weeks, excessive growth was detected only by comparing birth characteristics to their predicted values at 38 weeks' gestation. Our data suggest that individual growth curve standards may identify several patterns of excessive fetal growth that could represent different pathophysiologic mechanisms, ie, failure to terminate growth after 38 weeks versus a defect in a still unknown growth regulator. The individual fetal growth curve standards method gives additional information and discriminates well between normal and excessive fetal growth.\r"

Compared with anteverted (N = 243) or axial (N = 149) locations, the retroverted uterus (N = 66) was associated with a lower mean sample weight per aspiration (22, 18, and 15 mg, respectively; P less than .01) and a greater frequency of multiple-pass procedures (23, 31, and 52%, respectively; P less than .0001). To improve sampling efficiency in selected cases of uterine retroversion, we adopted a transvesical approach. When compared with transabdominal or transcervical techniques, transvesical CVS had the highest single-pass success rate (33, 33, and 60%, respectively). Only one in 30 transvesical cases required three placental passes, compared with nine of 36 retroverted uteri sampled by either transabdominal or transcervical techniques (P less than .05). The mean transvesical sample weight was 18.7 mg; at least 10 mg was retrieved in all cases. Post-procedure bleeding occurred in four instances and an additional patient suffered a spontaneous loss at 16 weeks' gestation. Aneuploidy was found in four of 30 biopsy specimens, and the remaining pregnancies either have delivered at term (N = 18) or are continuing (N = 7). Our preliminary experience suggests that selected use of this CVS method may improve sampling efficiency without increasing the incidence of complications.\r"

Three patients with prior 4-incision RK, with follow-up of 4 to 26 months, were steepened a mean of 1.63 diopters keratometrically; three patients with prior 8-incision RK, with follow-up of 3 to 12 months, were steepened a mean of 1.46 D keratometrically. Comparison of intraoperative with postoperative keratometry demonstrated a substantial loss of effect with time, which stabilized by 2 months in 4-incision RK patients and by 3 months in 8-incision RK patients. Nevertheless, placement of interrupted sutures across reopened radial incisions consistently induced central corneal steepening in these six patients.\r"

What has increased is the rate of disability, the reasons for which are uncertain. Not only has this phenomenon heightened the awareness of low back pain, but it has led to an explosion in costs. Although a precise estimate is impossible, it is plausible that the direct medical and indirect costs of these conditions are in the range of more than $50 billion per annum, and could be as high as $100 billion at the extreme. Of these costs, 75% or more can be attributed to the 5% of people who become disabled temporarily or permanently from back pain--a phenomenon that seems more rooted in psychosocial rather than disease determinants. Within this overall equation, spinal surgery plays a relatively small role, although the contribution to disability probably has more than passing significance. The future challenge, if costs are to be controlled, appears to lie squarely with prevention and optimum management of disability, rather than perpetrating a myth that low back pain is a serious health disorder.\r"

Symptoms of fever, weight loss, recumbency pain, morning stiffness, acute severe pain, or colicky back pain represent specific entry points into the algorithm for diagnosis of back pain from underlying systemic illnesses. These patients will generally require a plain roentgenographic examination with subsequent scintography, MRI, CT, laboratory work, and biopsy as indicated by any positive findings during the diagnostic work-up. Therapy for individuals with nonmechanical low back pain is directed at the specific medical disorder that is the cause of their symptoms.\r"

Stable, short segment constructs can be achieved even in the face of the most radical decompressions and vertebral resection. This technique is not, however, without risks. A thorough understanding of pedicle anatomy, pedicle screw insertion technique, fusion biology, and biomechanical considerations are paramount to achieve safe stabilization of the lumbosacral spine with this technique.\r"

SVFTLS ...) at the carboxyl terminus of the last putative transmembrane helix of the lactose (lac) permease of Escherichia coli are important for protection against proteolytic degradation and suggest that this region of the permease may be necessary for proper folding. Stop codons (TAA) have now been substituted sequentially for amino acid codons 396-401 in the lacY gene, and the termination mutants were expressed from the plasmid pT7-5. With respect to transport, permease truncated at residue 396 or 397 is completely defective, while molecules truncated at residues 398, 399, 400, and 401, respectively, exhibit 15-25%, 30-40%, 40-45%, and 70-100% of wild-type activity. As judged by pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine, wild-type permease or permease truncated at residue 401 is stable, while permease molecules truncated at position 400, 399, 398, 397, or 396 are degraded at increasingly rapid rates. The findings indicate that either the last turn of putative helix XII or the region immediately distal to helix XII is important for proper folding and protection against proteolytic degradation.\r"

  ".W": "When RecA protein, in the form of a nucleoprotein filament containing circular single-stranded DNA (plus strand only), reacts with homologous linear duplex DNA, a directional transfer ensues of a strand from the duplex DNA to the nucleoprotein filament, resulting in the displacement of the linear plus strand in the 5' to 3' direction. The initial homologous synapsis, however, can occur at either end of the duplex DNA, or anywhere in between, and when homology is restricted to different regions of the duplex DNA, the joint molecules that form in each region show striking differences in stability upon deproteinization: distal joints greater than proximal joints much greater than medial joints. In the deproteinized distal joints, which are thermostable, 2000 nucleotide residues of the circular plus strand are resistant to P1 nuclease; both strands of the original duplex DNA remain resistant to P1 nuclease, and the potentially displaceable linear plus strand, which has a 3' homologous end, remains resistant to Escherichia coli exonuclease I. These observations suggest that RecA protein promotes homologous pairing and strand exchange via long three-stranded DNA intermediates and, moreover, that, once formed, such triplex structures in natural DNA are stable even when RecA protein has been removed.\r"

The secondary structures but not the trace of the unligated enzyme have been slightly revised in the F6P complex at this higher resolution. Helix H4 in the unligated structure has been refined to a helix-like coil, and two very short 3(10) helices have been found, one in H4 and one in H5. F6P at 10 mM concentration in the absence of divalent metals in our study shows major binding at the active site and minor binding at the AMP site. The major site has almost equal full occupancy in the C1 and C2 chains of the crystallographic asymmetric unit, while the minor site shows occupancy only in the C1 chain at about 50%. The electron density in both (2Fo - Fc) and (Fo - Fc) maps calculated by omitting F6P slightly favors the beta anomer of D-F6P over the alpha anomer. Possible functions of the active-site residues are discussed, and candidates are suggested for site-directed mutagenesis.\r"

  ".U": "91195277\r", 
  ".W": "Two forms of lactoferrin, an intact lactoferrin and a \"nicked\" but apparently intact (i.e., 78-kDa) form, have been isolated from the urine of preterm infants fed human milk. These two forms of lactoferrin, demonstrated to be entirely of maternal origin, were copurified using affinity columns of immobilized single-stranded DNA-agarose. The relative concentrations of the intact lactoferrin and the \"nicked\" lactoferrin were determined after denaturation and separation by reverse-phase HPLC. N-terminal sequence analyses showed that the intact 78-kDa form had lost two residues from its N terminus. The nicked 78-kDa form was composed of only two fragments; one fragment was identified as the N terminus of the N-lobe (residues 3-283). The other fragment started with Ser-284 and included the alpha-helical structures at the C terminus of the N-lobe, as well as the entire C-lobe. Although no disulfide bonds connect these two fragments, they were tightly associated in vivo and were not separated in vitro except under denaturing conditions. Limited in vitro digestion of human milk lactoferrin with trypsin produced a nicked, but stable (78-kDa), form of DNA-binding lactoferrin nearly indistinguishable from the isolated urinary lactoferrin, except for the absence of one additional arginine residue at the N terminus of the N-lobe. Residues involved in the stable molecular interaction between fragments were evaluated using data obtained from the high-resolution crystal structure of hololactoferrin. Two features, entirely within the N-lobe, account for the lack of fragment dissociation after cleavage at residue 283 in vivo: an extensive interface at the hinge region behind the iron-binding cleft and an \"anchor\" sequence traversing the remainder of the N-lobe at 90 degrees relative to the fragment interface. These results document the remarkably limited degradation of absorbed lactoferrin in vivo and suggest that iron-binding activity, receptor-binding properties, and postulated immune cell regulatory functions remain intact.\r"

  ".W": "We have cloned the gene for the chicken erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 (formerly Eryf1, NF-E1, or GF-1). The gene is composed of six exons, two of which encode the two finger domains of the protein. Transcription of GATA-1 in chicken embryonic erythroid cells initiates from multiple sites clustered approximately 200 base pairs upstream from the start of protein-coding sequence. A number of sequence motifs for known DNA-binding proteins are found to be protected in DNase I-footprinting experiments by either erythroid or brain nuclear extracts or by both. Notably, a cluster of three GATA-1 sites is protected by the erythroid extract, as well as by purified GATA-1. We find that the upstream region of the gene functions as a powerful promoter when transfected into embryonic erythroid cells. In primary chicken embryo fibroblasts the promoter exhibits lower activity, which is increased when the cells are cotransfected with a second plasmid expressing the GATA-1 cDNA. The results suggest that GATA-1 protein plays an autoregulatory role in its own expression.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) made against these NK-like effector cells inhibited their lytic activity. These anti-NCC mAbs were examined with human NK cells for their effects. It was observed that these mAbs bound specifically to a small percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes (5-15%) and to the majority (greater than 85%) of CD3- NK cells. The mAbs inhibited human NK cell lysis against a variety of transformed cell lines. Single-cell assays showed that the mAbs exerted their effects through inhibition of conjugate formation (recognition). However, the mAbs did not inhibit NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Biochemical analysis of the NK cell molecule revealed that a dimeric structure was involved (distinct from antigen receptors on T cells). Thus, this molecule appears to be a candidate NK cell antigen receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Dendritic cells (DCs), such as Langerhans cells (LCs) of the epidermis and the DCs of lymphoid organs such as spleen, are potent antigen presenting cells. DCs express high levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, but, partly because of the low numbers of primary DCs in any tissue, there has been no detailed study of the biochemistry of their class II molecules. This information may be needed to help explain recent findings that DCs process native protein antigens when freshly isolated from epidermis and spleen. Processing ceases during culture, yet a strong accessory function for activating resting T cells develops. We studied immunoprecipitates of DC class II and invariant chain (Ii) molecules by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We found that (i) freshly isolated LCs synthesize large amounts of class II and Ii polypeptides; (ii) Ii molecules that are known to be involved in antigen processing display an unusually large number of sialic acids in fresh LCs; (iii) with culture, class II and Ii synthesis decreases dramatically and has virtually ceased at 3 days; and (iv) the turnover of class II in pulse/chase experiments is slow, being undetectable over a 12- to 32-hr culture period, whereas the turnover of Ii is rapid. We conclude that MHC class II molecules of DCs do not seem to be qualitatively unique. However, the regulation of class II and Ii expression is distinctive in that biosynthesis proceeds vigorously for a short period of time and the newly synthesized class II remains stably on the cell surface, whereas Ii turns over rapidly. This may enable DCs to process and retain antigens in the peripheral tissues such as skin and migrate to the lymphoid organs to activate T cells there.\r"

  ".W": "Upon activation of human neutrophils, C3b receptors (type 1 complement receptors, CR1) are rapidly translocated from an intracellular pool to the surface, increasing plasma membrane expression 6- to 10-fold. This is followed by reinternalization and degradation of the receptors, even in the absence of ligand. Upregulation of surface CR1 may occur without exocytosis of primary or secondary granules, and intracellular CR1 in resting neutrophils does not sediment with these granules on density gradient fractionation. To directly localize the intracellular pools of CR1, we used immunoelectron microscopy of fixed, permeabilized cells. In resting neutrophils, CR1 is associated with the membranes of smooth-surfaced, empty-appearing vesicles whose irregular borders clearly distinguish them from primary and secondary granules. After activation by fMet-Leu-Phe, the intracellular pool is primarily found in large, conspicuous, multivesicular bodies. These bodies also incorporate colloidal gold from the extracellular fluid, suggesting that they are formed by endocytosis. Thus, the sites in which CR1 is stored in resting cells, and recycled in activated cells, are structurally unique and morphologically distinguishable.\r"

  ".W": "A set of mutant coding sequences for Chinese hamster metallothionein (MT) 2 in which codons for individual cysteines were replaced by serine codons was cloned into a yeast expression system. MT gene expression was placed under control of a constitutive promoter on a multicopy Escherichia coli-yeast shuttle vector. MTs were expressed in a metal-sensitive host that lacks the endogenous MT gene. The expressed MTs conferred increased metal resistance to the yeast host. A sensitive assay for cadmium resistance was developed in which population doubling times were monitored in rich liquid medium supplemented with a sublethal dose of CdCl2. Measurements on mutants with single cysteine replacements at 12 positions revealed two mutant classes. One class (Cys----Ser at position 5, 13, 19, or 33) did not affect the detoxification capacity of MT. A second class (Cys----Ser at position 7, 15, 26, 29, 44, 48, 50, or 60) conferred to the host markedly less resistance to cadmium. Bridging cysteines were more critical to cadmium resistance. All five bridging cysteine mutants studied (at positions 7, 15, 44, 50, and 60) conferred lower cadmium resistance. In contrast, mutation of four out of seven terminal cysteines (at position 5, 13, 19, or 33) was shown to be inconsequential. Mutations tend to be more detrimental in the alpha domain than in the beta domain in conveying cadmium resistance, suggesting that the contribution of individual cysteine to the detoxification function of MT is site specific.\r"

  ".W": "Use has been made of the mechanism of DNA deoxyribose damage by the ene-diyne-containing chromophore of the antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin to provide chemical evidence for the structure of the activated drug-DNA complex. Radical centers at C-2 and C-6 of the diradical form of the glutathione-activated chromophore abstract hydrogen atoms from C-1' of the C residue and C-5' of the T residue in AGC.GCT to generate a bistranded lesion consisting of an abasic site at C and a strand break at T. This laboratory has proposed a molecular model for the drug-DNA interaction in which the naphthoate moiety of the chromophore intercalates between A.T and G.C, placing the diradical core in the minor groove, so that the radical centers at C-6 and C-2 are close to C-5' of T and C-1' of C, respectively. To determine which radical center abstracts one of the hydrogen atoms from C-5', the self-complementary oligodeoxynucleotide GCAGCGCTGC was synthesized with 2H at both 5' positions of the T residue and treated with glutathione-activated chromophore. Sequencing-gel electrophoresis showed that drug attack was limited to the T and C residues and that abstraction of 2H from C-5' exhibited a small isotope selection effect of 1.25. 1H NMR spectroscopic examination of the reacted chromophore, isolated by HPLC, indicated that 2H was selectively abstracted by C-6, providing experimental corroboration of the model and further elucidating the chemical mechanism. Since direct strand breakage at the T residue exceeds (44% more) abasic site formation at the C residue, other models of drug-DNA interaction leading to only single-strand breaks are also considered.\r"

Accordingly, two totally unrelated proteins, on the average, share 30 identical tripeptides, two tetrapeptides, and one pentapeptide per 500 residues. With this in mind, the 221-residue-long influenza virus hemagglutinin II (IVHA-II), as a representative of alien antigens, was compared with three diverse proteins representing the host: 533-residue-long chicken c-src protein kinase (c-src product of the cellular oncogene of Rous sarcoma virus), 595-residue-long human estrogen receptor, and 585-residue-long human serum albumin. Forty-three tripeptides, two tetrapeptides, and one pentapeptide of IVHA-II were also found in one or the other of the three host proteins. Six regions of IVHA-II (9-22 residues long) in which oligopeptides were clustered that were identical to their host oligopeptides were defined as \"host-homologous\" regions, and the remaining regions were called \"nonself\" or \"pathogen-specific\" regions. Because the total number of host proteins is vastly more than three, host-homologous regions were no doubt underestimated, while only one or two regions of IVHA-II must remain as truly pathogen-specific. Nevertheless, oligopeptide analysis of two known T-cell response-eliciting peptide fragments and one known inert peptide fragment of a virus and a malarial protozoan readily revealed the latter to be a host-homologous region. Of the two known T-cell response-eliciting peptide fragments, one was more nonself than the other. Not surprisingly, the more nonself fragment elicited helper T-cell response from individuals of diverse major histocompatibility complex haplotypes, whereas the less nonself fragment elicited cytotoxic T-cell response only from HLA-A2 human individuals.\r"

The exact role of aCL antibodies in pathogenesis is not clear and the mechanism by which the antibodies may induce the various manifestations is unknown. In the current study we evaluated the effect of passive transfer of aCL antibodies (to the tail vein of naive mice) on fecundity, fetal loss (fetal resorption), and the weight of embryos and placentae. Two types of aCL antibodies were employed: (i) mouse monoclonal aCL antibodies derived from a BALB/c mouse in which experimental systemic lupus erythematosus was induced by a pathogenic idiotype (idiotype 16/6) of anti-DNA antibodies and (ii) polyclonal IgG and IgM aCL antibodies derived from serum of a patient with primary anti-phospholipid syndrome. After infusion of either antibody (10 micrograms per mouse) we could demonstrate lower fecundity rate, increased resorption index of embryos (equivalent to recurrent fetal loss), lower number of embryos per pregnancy, and lower mean weights of embryos and placentae in comparison to mice infused with appropriate control immunoglobulins. We conclude that the aCL antibodies may have direct effects on fecundity and on the outcome of pregnancy.\r"

This result provides the basis for a method to evaluate the helical repeat of any DNA segment by comparative electrophoresis measurements. The sequence of interest is placed between two A-tract bends and the phasing is varied over an entire helical turn. Knowledge of the number of base pairs between the bends in the cis isomer, which has the lowest electrophoretic mobility, allows calculation of the average helical repeat of the inserted sequence. In the course of these experiments we observed an unexpected dependence of electrophoretic mobility on the shape of DNA molecules: in high-percentage polyacrylamide gels, those bent molecules for which we deduced a right-handed superhelical form are less retarded than their homologous left-handed isomers. To explain this finding we propose that superhelical chirality influences the choice of DNA migration pathway, leading to rotation of the DNA molecule relative to the local coordinate frame in the gel. High-percentage gels have sufficiently close contact with the right-handed DNA helical twist to differentiate the frictional consequences of right- and left-handed twisting motions.\r"

Purified mutant rhodopsin pigments were prepared in which Glu-113 was replaced individually by Gln (E113Q), Asp (E113D), Asn (E113N), or Ala (E113A). E113Q, E113N, and E113A existed as pH-dependent equilibrium mixtures of unprotonated and protonated Schiff base (PSB) forms. The Schiff base pKa values determined by spectrophotometric titration were 6.00 (E113Q), 6.71 (E113N), and 5.70 (E113A). Thus, mutation of Glu-113 markedly reduced the Schiff base pKa. The addition of NaCl promoted the formation of a PSB in E113Q and E113A. An exogenously supplied solute anion replaced Glu-113 to compensate for the positive charge of the PSB in these mutants. The lambda max values of the PSB forms of the mutants in NaCl were 496 nm (E113Q), 506 nm (E113A), 510 nm (E113D), and 520 nm (E113N). To evaluate the effect of different types of solute anions on lambda max values, mutants were prepared in sodium salts of halides, perchlorate, and a series of carboxylic acids of various sizes and acidity. The lambda max values of E113Q and E113A depended on the solute anion present and ranged from 488 nm to 522 nm for E113Q and from 486 nm to 528 nm for E113A. The solute anion affected the lambda max values of E113N and E113D to lesser degrees. The reactivities of the mutants to hydroxylamine were also studied. Whereas rhodopsin was stable to hydroxylamine in the dark, E113N reacted slowly and E113Q reacted rapidly under these conditions, indicating structural differences in the Schiff base environments. The lambda max values and solute anion dependencies of the Glu-113 mutants indicate that interactions between Schiff base and its counterion play a significant role in determining the lambda max of rhodopsin.\r"

We recently discovered that the pathogenesis of diabetes in NOD strain mice was associated with T-cell reactivity to an antigen cross-reactive with a mycobacterial 65-kDa heat shock protein. To identify peptide epitopes critical to the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus of NOD mice, we studied the specificities of helper T-cell clones capable of causing hyperglycemia and diabetes. We now report the identification of a functionally important peptide within the sequence of the human variant of the 65-kDa heat shock protein molecule. T-cell clones recognizing this peptide mediate insulitis and hyperglycemia. Alternatively, the T cells can be attenuated and used as therapeutic T-cell vaccines to abort the diabetogenic process. Moreover, administration of the peptide itself to NOD mice can also down-regulate immunity to the 65-kDa heat shock protein and prevent the development of diabetes. Thus, T-cell vaccination and specific peptide therapy are feasible in spontaneous autoimmune diabetes.\r"

To investigate the molecular basis for these differences, recombinant full-length clones were constructed by reciprocal DNA fragment exchange between a molecular clone derived from a monocyte-tropic isolate (ADA) and portions of two full-length clones incapable of infection or replication in primary monocyte cultures (HXB2 and NL4-3). Virions derived from proviral clones that contained ADA sequences encoding vpu and the N and C termini of the surface envelope glycoprotein (gp120) were incapable of replication in monocytes. However, a 283-base-pair ADA sequence encoding amino acids 240-333 of the mature gp120 protein conferred the capacity for high-level virus replication in primary monocytes. The predicted amino acid sequence of this ADA clone differed from NL4-3 and HXB2 at 22 of 94 residues in this portion of gp120, which includes the entire third variable domain. Only 2 of 11 residues implicated in CD4 binding are located in this region of gp120 and are identical in HXB2, NL4-3, and ADA. Alignment of the ADA sequence with published amino acid sequences of three additional monocyte-replicative and three monocyte-nonreplicative clones indicates 6 discrete residues with potential involvement in conferring productive human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection of primary monocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes (phagocytes) are a critical component of host defense against infections. However, these cells also play a significant role in host tissue damage in many noninfectious diseases, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury syndromes and rejection of transplanted organs. The leukocyte adhesion molecule family CD11/CD18 (beta 2 integrins) is critical to the function of polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes in inflammation and injury. Inherited deficiency of CD11/CD18 impairs phagocyte chemotaxis, adhesion and transmigration across endothelium, and clearance of invading microorganisms through phagocytosis and cell-mediated killing. Furthermore, murine monoclonal antibodies directed against the CD11b/CD18 (CR3) heterodimer have been shown to reduce, by 50%-80%, phagocyte-mediated ischemia-reperfusion injury in several organ systems, such as the myocardium, liver, and gastrointestinal tract and to inhibit development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Expression of CD11b/CD18 in a soluble and functional form might therefore be potentially useful as an anti-inflammatory agent. We have now expressed a recombinant soluble heterodimeric form of this human beta 2 integrin, normally expressed as two noncovalently associated membrane-bound subunits. The secreted receptor exhibited direct and specific binding to its ligand, iC3b, the major complement C3 opsonin, and inhibited binding of polymorphonuclear cells to recombinant interleukin 1-activated endothelium.\r"

The cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame of 1770 base pairs encoding a protein of 590 amino acids (64,509 Da) and untranslated regions of 60 and 490 base pairs at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. The cDNA hybridized to a 2.4-kilobase retinal mRNA. The amino acid sequence derived from the cDNA sequence contains a glutamic acid-rich domain in which 68 of 109 amino acids are glutamic acid. In addition, this domain contains four repeats of a peptide of 11 amino acids and two repeats of a peptide of 26 amino acids. A polyclonal antibody raised against a decapeptide corresponding to the undecapeptide repeat sequence reacted with a protein in an extract of bovine rod outer segments, whose molecular mass, 65 kDa, corresponded to that of the above glutamic acid-rich protein.

When the receptor is modified to carry a foreign unregulated transactivation domain, transcription can be induced efficiently by both estrogen and antiestrogens. Under apparent saturation conditions, antihormone-receptor complexes binding to responsive enhancer elements elicit only a low level of transcription. In addition, we show that both estrogen and an antiestrogen, nafoxidine, effect very similar alterations in chromatin structure at a responsive promoter. These results indicate that in vivo steroid receptor action can be regulated subsequent to the DNA binding step, by regulating interactions with the target transcriptional machinery. In this regard, antihormones can function by establishing receptor-DNA complexes that are transcriptionally nonproductive.\r"

To establish phylogenetic relationships among the Plasmodium species and to unravel the mystery of the origin of P. falciparum, we have analyzed and compared phylogenetically the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences of the species of malaria that infect humans as well as a number of those sequences from species that infect animals. Although this comparison confirmed the three established major subgroups, broadly classed as avian, simian, and rodent, we find that the human pathogen P. falciparum is monophyletic with the avian subgroup, indicating that P. falciparum and avian parasites share a relatively recent avian progenitor. The other important human pathogen, P. vivax, is very similar to a representative of the simian group of Plasmodium. The relationship between P. falciparum and the avian parasites, and the overall phylogeny of the genus, provides evidence of an exception to Farenholz's rule, which propounds synchronous speciation between host and parasite.\r"

  ".W": "Transcription of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes is negatively regulated in undifferentiated F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells via the conserved upstream regulatory region. This region contains constitutive enhancers and an inducible enhancer, the interferon consensus sequence (ICS), that is responsible for interferon-induced transcription. A series of mutations in the ICS, but not in the enhancer elements, resulted in an increase in expression of the MHC class I promoter in F9 cells. However, these ICS mutants did not increase promoter activity in F9 cells differentiated after retinoic acid treatment. Results of mobility-shift DNA-binding assays and methylation interference experiments showed that undifferentiated F9 cells contained a factor(s) that bound to a sequence within the 5' and central part of the ICS. This binding site, termed the MHC negative regulatory element (NRE), coincided with the site of mutations that increased promoter activity in F9 cells and was distinct from the element to which interferon-response factors bind. The factor(s) that binds to the MHC NRE was not detected in differentiated F9 cells treated with retinoic acid or in other cells expressing MHC class I genes. Finally, introduction of concatenated, double-stranded NRE oligomers, but not oligomers of unrelated sequences, into F9 cells abolished negative regulation of the MHC class I promoter activity, providing evidence that the NRE binding factor is responsible for repression of the MHC class I genes in F9 cells.\r"

Shortly before expression of the HLA-DR alpha beta dimer on the cell surface, however, the I chain is removed from the intracellular alpha beta I complex by a mechanism thought to involve proteolysis. In this report, we show that treatment of purified alpha beta I with the cysteine proteinase cathepsin B results in the specific proteolysis of the HLA-DR-associated I chain in vitro. As a consequence of this, the I chain is removed and free alpha beta dimers are released from alpha beta I. Although alpha beta I fails to bind an immunogenic peptide, the released alpha beta dimers acquire the ability to bind the peptide after proteolysis of the I chain. These results suggest that the I chain inhibits immunogenic peptide binding to alpha beta I early during intracellular transport and demonstrate that proteolysis is likely to be the in vivo mechanism of I chain removal.\r"

We show that retroviral vectors can stably introduce genes into antigen-specific murine and human T lymphocytes in culture. Murine helper T cells were transduced with the retroviral vector SAX to express both neomycin-resistance and human adenosine deaminase genes. These cells were expanded in culture and selected for expression of neomycin resistance with G418. The gene insertion, selection, and culture expansion did not alter antigen specificity or growth characteristics of the T cells in vitro. To determine if cultured T cells might be used for gene therapy, their persistence and continued expression of the introduced genes was evaluated in nude mice transplanted with the SAX-transduced T cells. G418-resistant cells could be readily recovered from the spleens of recipients of transduced T cells for several months. In addition, recovered cells continued to produce human adenosine deaminase. Based on these observations, we studied cultured human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as a candidate cell for a trial of gene transfer in man. Exponential cultures of interleukin-2-stimulated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were efficiently transduced with the neomycin-resistance gene using the retroviral vector N2. Gene insertion and subsequent G418 selection did not substantially alter the growth characteristics, interleukin 2 dependence, membrane phenotype, or cytotoxicity profile of the transduced T cells. These studies provided a portion of the experimental evidence supporting the feasibility of the presently ongoing clinical trials of lymphocyte gene therapy in cancer as well as in patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Glanzmann thrombasthenia is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by a decrease or absence of functional platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa (alpha IIb beta 3) integrin receptors. Although thrombasthenia is a rare disorder, its occurrence is increased in some regions of the world where intracommunity marriage and consanguinity are commonplace, resulting in increased expression of autosomal recessive traits. We have been studying two populations having an unusually high frequency of Glanzmann disease, Iraqi Jews and Arabs living in Israel, and were able to distinguish the populations on the basis of immunodetectable GPIIIa and platelet surface vitronectin receptor (alpha v beta 3) expression. In this article, we describe molecular genetic studies based on use of the PCR that have allowed us to characterize platelet mRNA sequences encoding GPIIb and GPIIIa from patients in these populations. In six of six Iraqi-Jewish families studied, cDNA sequence analysis identified an 11-base deletion within exon 12 of the GPIIIa gene. This mutation produces a frameshift leading to protein termination shortly before the transmembrane domain of GPIIIa. In contrast, a 13-base deletion encompassing the splice acceptor site of exon 4 of the GPIIb gene was found in three of five Arab kindreds studied. This deletion results in forced alternative splicing to a downstream AG acceptor, producing a 6-amino acid deletion in the GPIIb protein, including a single cysteine residue. These nucleotide sequence variations were exploited to design a rapid, PCR-based oligonucleotide dot-blot hybridization test for both pre- and postnatal diagnosis of Glanzmann disease. These studies demonstrate the heterogeneity of Glanzmann thrombasthenia in different populations, and its homogeneity within geographically restricted populations, and offer insight into the requirements for integrin surface expression.\r"

The IP6 receptor comprises a protein complex of 115-, 105-, and 50-kDa subunits, all of which comigrate under native conditions. The Kd of the receptor for IP6 is 12 nM, whereas inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (IP5), IP4, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) are 50%, 30%, and 15%, respectively, as potent. Two protein complexes copurify with the IP4 receptor fraction. A 182/123-kDa complex elutes first from the affinity column followed by a 174/84-kDa protein complex, which elutes at higher salt. Both complexes show high affinity for IP4 (Kd = 3-4 nM). IP5, IP6, and IP3 display approximately 25%, 10%, and 0.1%, respectively, the affinity of IP4. Ligand binding to IP6 and IP4 receptors is inhibited 50% by heparin at 0.1 microgram/ml. IP4 receptor proteins are stoichiometrically phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, whereas negligible phosphorylation is observed for the IP6 receptor.\r"

There is some indication that DA2 receptors may be involved in mediating the effects of DA, but little is known regarding the nature of this receptor in the kidney. Autoradiographic localization of [3H]spiperone, a DA2 antagonist, indicated that high-density binding was restricted to inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs). [3H]Spiperone binding was saturable, high affinity (Kd, 17.2 +/- 1.65 nM), and high density (Bmax, 935 +/- 83 fmol per mg of protein). The photosensitive spiperone analogue N-(p-azido-m-[125I]iodophenethyl)spiperone labeled similar sized proteins of Mr = 120,000 in membranes prepared from the kidney inner medulla, striatum, and pituitary. However, the rank-order competition profile for the [3H]spiperone binding in the kidney inner medulla differed from the DA2 receptor in striatum and pituitary and, furthermore, RNA (Northern) blot analyses of kidney inner medullary RNA with brain DA2 receptor oligonucleotide probes were negative. Functionally, DA stimulated prostaglandin E2 production by IMCD cells, an effect that could be blocked by the DA2 antagonist domperidone. These results indicate that the kidney inner medulla expresses a functional DA receptor that may represent a newly identified DA receptor subtype (here designated DA2K). Moreover, these results suggest that the kidney inner medulla may be a significant site at which DA, either directly or indirectly, influences water and electrolyte excretion.\r"

A CD36-specific monoclonal antibody, OKM8, inhibits the adhesion of malaria-infected erythrocytes (IRBC) to purified CD36 and cells expressing CD36. Monospecific polyclonal anti-idiotype (anti-Id) antibodies, raised against monoclonal antibody OKM8, expressed determinants molecularly mimicking the CD36 binding domain for the adhesion of IRBC. Purified rabbit anti-Id antibodies reacted with the surface of IRBC by immunofluorescence, directly supported the adhesion of wild-type P. falciparum malaria isolates, and inhibited IRBC cytoadherence to melanoma cells. An approximately 270-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Id antibodies from surface-labeled and metabolically labeled IRBC and was competitively inhibited by soluble CD36. These results support the hypothesis that CD36 is a receptor and the approximately 270-kDa protein, sequestrin, is a complementary ligand involved in the adhesion of IRBC to host-cell endothelium. Sequestrin is a candidate malaria vaccine antigen, and anti-Id antibodies that recognize this molecule may be useful for passive immunotherapy of cerebral and severe P. falciparum malaria.\r"

The sequence of the protein was deduced from the sequence of overlapping cDNAs isolated from a cDNA library and from clones of the products generated by the polymerase chain reaction from random-primed, first-strand cDNA. The sequences of these clones indicated that there were two mRNAs for UBF and that the encoded proteins were similar but not identical. One form of rat UBF was essentially identical to human UBF. The second class of UBF mRNA contained an in-frame \"deletion\" in the coding region that results in the deletion of 37 amino acids from the predicted protein sequence. This deletion reduces the predicted molecular size of the encoded form of UBF by approximately 4400 from 89.4 kDa to 85 kDa and significantly alters the structure of one of the four HMG-1 homology regions (HMG box-2) in that form of UBF. Evidence for the existence of two mRNAs in rat cells was confirmed by a probe protection assay, and we provide evidence that other vertebrate cells contain these same two forms of UBF mRNA. These results are consistent with the observation that UBF purified from four different vertebrates migrates as two bands upon SDS/PAGE. It has been hypothesized that the HMG motifs are the DNA-binding domains of UBF. Altering one of these \"boxes,\" as in the second form of UBF, may alter the functional characteristics of the transcription factor. Thus, the existence of different forms of UBF may have important ramifications for transcription by RNA polymerase I.\r"

In the present study, an insertion plasmid was constructed that contained three tandem in-frame repeats of a 310-base-pair DNA sequence encoding the CRR from streptococcal M6 protein under control of a constitutive viral promoter. The plasmid was used to introduce the bacterial sequences into the VV genome by homologous recombination. Surprisingly, the recombinant VV:CRR3X virus that was isolated appeared to represent not an individual recombinant virus but a complex mixture of variants that contained from 1 to greater than 20 tandem copies of the CRR region at the insertion site. This genomic complexity was mirrored at the transcriptional level in that a nested set of coterminal transcripts was detected in VV:CRR3X-infected cells, which increased in size from 1400 to 6600 bases by increments of approximately 300 bases. All transcripts containing two or more CRR inserts appeared functional, as Western (immuno) blot analyses of VV:CRR3X-infected cell extracts revealed a family of CRR-related proteins with apparent molecular masses that increased from 30 kDa upward in increments of 10 kDa. All data are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in the VV:CRR3X recombinants is from random crossover events that occur within the CRR region during viral DNA replication. These results suggest that the genomic diversity generated by the \"recombinogenic\" properties of vaccinia recombinants containing tandem foreign inserts could be used to facilitate induction of a broadly protective immune response against antigenically diverse pathogenic agents.\r"

  ".W": "The nervous and immune systems interact in a bidirectional fashion. For example, the neuropeptide substance P (SP) has been implicated in a variety of immune responses. Conversely, cytokines, a class of immunoregulatory glycoproteins, affect the synthesis of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors. This paper examines the role of cytokines in regulating neuropeptide expression in sympathetic neurons. Exposure of cultured explants of the rat superior cervical ganglion to the cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) increased levels of SP. IL-1 beta increased neuronal SP expression in dissociated cultures of ganglion neuronal and nonneuronal cells but had no effect on peptide content in pure neuronal cultures. By contrast, treatment with a differentiation-promoting protein, leukemia inhibitory factor, increased SP in both pure neuronal and mixed cultures, indicating a different mechanism of action for the two molecules. The specificity of the IL-1 beta effect was further demonstrated by the lack of response to treatment with other cytokines, including interleukin 2, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The cell type necessary for the IL-1 beta activity is probably the ganglion Schwann cell. Treatment with a synthetic immunosuppressant glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, blocked the increase in SP after treatment with IL-1 beta. These observations support the hypothesis that neuropeptide expression is regulated, in part, by interactions with specific immunoregulators. In addition, the data suggest a role for SP in mediating the response of the superior cervical ganglion to injury of the ganglion itself or to the fibers innervating it.\r"

We have found that E2 dimers, preformed in solution independent of DNA, exhibit substantial cooperativity of DNA binding as detected by both nitrocellulose filter retention and footprint analysis techniques. If the binding sites are widely spaced, E2 forms stable DNA loops visible by electron microscopy. When three widely separated binding sites reside on the DNA, E2 condenses the molecule into a bow-tie structure. This implies that each E2 dimer has at least two independent surfaces for multimerization. Two naturally occurring shorter forms of the protein, E2C and E8/E2, which function in vivo as repressors of transcription, do not form such loops. Thus, the looping function of E2 maps to the 161-amino acid activation domain. These results support the looping model of transcription activation by enhancers.\r"

Each polypeptide chain, encoded on one of the viral polyproteins, is less than half the size of cellular aspartic proteinases and contains only one of the two active-site aspartate residues. A plasmid was constructed to generate a genetically linked dimer of the proteinase (PR) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1, composed of two copies of the PR sequence linked by a structurally flexible hinge region. The expression product was stable and active against HIV polyprotein substrates. Mutational analysis revealed that the linked dimer, and not multimers thereof, contained the proteolytic activity. Expression of the linked dimer as a component of a HIV polyprotein by in vitro translation gave rapid autocatalytic processing, whereas the wild-type polyprotein was stable on prolonged incubation. Transfection of HIV subviral or proviral constructs, containing the linked dimer of HIV PR, gave premature processing of the viral polyproteins, thus preventing particle formation and infectivity. Premature processing also led to increased cell toxicity.\r"

Female DBA/2 recipients of WGA+ NZB bone marrow cell or fetal liver cell transplants exhibited elevated serum autoantibody levels and developed glomerular lesions characteristic of NZB mice when analyzed greater than 100 days after transplantation. These pathological disturbances were not observed in DBA/2 recipients of DBA/2 stem cell preparations.

  ".W": "Since the introduction by Shepp and Vardi [Shepp, L. A. & Vardi, Y. (1982) IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 1, 113-121] of the expectation-maximization algorithm for the generation of maximum-likelihood images in emission tomography, a number of investigators have applied the maximum-likelihood method to imaging problems. Though this approach is promising, it is now well known that the unconstrained maximum-likelihood approach has two major drawbacks: (i) the algorithm is computationally demanding, resulting in reconstruction times that are not acceptable for routine clinical application, and (ii) the unconstrained maximum-likelihood estimator has a fundamental noise artifact that worsens as the iterative algorithm climbs the likelihood hill. In this paper the computation issue is addressed by proposing an implementation on the class of massively parallel single-instruction, multiple-data architectures. By restructuring the superposition integrals required for the expectation-maximization algorithm as the solutions of partial differential equations, the local data passage required for efficient computation on this class of machines is satisfied. For dealing with the \"noise artifact\" a Markov random field prior determined by Good's rotationally invariant roughness penalty is incorporated. These methods are demonstrated on the single-instruction multiple-data class of parallel processors, with the computation times compared with those on conventional and hypercube architectures.\r"

Clones are picked into microtiter plate wells and stored at -70 degrees C. A semiautomatic robot system allows the generation of filter replicas containing up to 10,000 clones per membrane. Sets of membranes containing 15-20 chromosome equivalents of both chromosomes will be used for the construction of ordered clone libraries by hybridization fingerprinting protocols. In addition, multiple sets of two membranes containing 4 chromosome equivalents of the human X chromosome, and one membrane containing 3 chromosome equivalents of chromosome 21, have been distributed to other interested laboratories as part of a system of reference libraries. This system allows other groups easy access to the clones and offers an efficient protocol to combine results generated in different laboratories using these libraries. Here we describe the construction of the libraries and demonstrate the use of high-density screening filters in oligonucleotide probe hybridizations and the isolation of cosmids by hybridization with probes from the X chromosome.\r"

We have determined the sequence of the mature form of the 170-kDa heavy subunit from cDNA clones and PCR-amplified fragments. The heavy subunit sequence consisted of a putative extracellular domain containing 1209 amino acids with 16 potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, a 26-amino acid hydrophobic region, and a 41-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. The presence of N-linked oligosaccharides was confirmed by culturing amebae with tunicamycin, which resulted in a decrease in the heavy subunit molecular mass to 160 kDa and a loss of lectin activity. The extracellular domain was remarkable for an extensive cysteine-rich domain that shared identify with similar regions of several other cell surface proteins and appeared to confer protease resistance to the subunit.\r"

We show that the nonstructural and the structural genes can function to produce infectious virus particles when they are expressed on two different RNA segments. The nonstructural genes are translated from an RNA in which the structural genes have been replaced by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene [Xiong, C., Levis, R., Shen, P., Schlesinger, S., Rice, C. M. & Huang, H. V. (1989) Science 243, 1188-1191]. The structural genes are encoded in a defective-interfering RNA but are translated from a subgenomic RNA. Both segments contain the cis-acting sequences required for replication and packaging and are copackaged. This type of genome provides a model for an ancestral intermediate between alphaviruses and the multipartite positive-strand RNA viruses of plants. These different viruses show sequence similarities in their replicative proteins and are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor.\r"

The Mr 57,000 subunit binds alpha Bgtx and seems to be present in two copies per receptor.

For this purpose the class II-restricted presentation of an immunodominant epitope of hen egg lysozyme [HEL-(46-61)] was studied in class II-positive B-lymphoma cells (M12.C3) transfected with genes encoding HEL molecules either (i) secreted in high (hi) or low (lo) amounts as soluble antigen [sHEL(hi/lo)], (ii) localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/salvage compartment (ER-HEL), or (iii) anchored on the cell surface as an integral membrane protein (mHEL). The corresponding sHEL, ER-HEL, and mHEL gene products were expressed as predicted except that HEL determinants accumulated in the culture supernatant as well as on the cell membrane of mHEL-transfected cells. Class II-positive cells endogenously expressing all three forms of HEL antigen constitutively presented the immunodominant HEL-(46-61) determinant with differential efficiency (mHEL, sHEL greater than ERHEL) to a class II-restricted T hybridoma. A second T hybridoma recognized endogenous HEL-(46-61) determinants constitutively presented on sHEL(hi) and mHEL transfectants but not on sHEL(lo) or ERHEL transfectants. The formation of HEL-(46-61)/I-Ak complexes in the ERHEL and sHEL(lo) transfectants was therefore limiting. Mixing experiments with different antigen-presenting cells indicated that the HEL-(46-61) determinant was derived from endogenous antigen rather than by reuptake of shed or secreted HEL determinants. We conclude that MHC class II molecules can present some antigenic determinants derived from endogenous proteins that are sequestered in the ER/salvage compartment as well as distally transported in the form of secretory or membrane antigens.\r"

Genomic blots indicated that 43 of 47 insect species from nine orders contained insertions, ranging in frequency from a few percent to greater than 50% of the 28S genes. Sequence analysis of these insertions from 8 species revealed 22 elements, 21 of which corresponded to R1 or R2 elements. Surprisingly, many species appeared to contain highly divergent copies of R1 and R2 elements. For example, a parasitic wasp contained at least four families of R1 elements; the Japanese beetle contained at least five families of R2 elements. The presence of these retrotransposable elements throughout Insecta and the observation that single species can harbor divergent families within its rRNA-encoding DNA loci present interesting questions concerning the age of these elements and the possibility of cross-species transfer.\r"

Although there is interest in developing human vaccines that induce CTL against the Plasmodium falciparum CS protein, humans have never been shown to produce CTL against any Plasmodium species protein or other parasite protein. We report that when peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from three of four volunteers immunized with irradiated P. falciparum sporozoites were stimulated in vitro with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the P. falciparum CS protein or a peptide including only amino acids 368-390 of the P. falciparum CS protein [CS-(368-390)], the PBMC lysed autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells transfected with the P. falciparum CS protein gene or incubated with CS-(368-390) tricosapeptide. Activity was antigen specific, genetically restricted, and dependent on CD8+ T cells. In one volunteer, seven peptides reflecting amino acids 311-400 were tested, and, as in B10.BR mice, CTL activity was only associated with the CS-(368-390) peptide. Development of an assay for studying human CTL against the CS and other malaria proteins and a method for constructing target cells by direct gene transfection provide a foundation for studying the role of CTL in protection against malaria.\r"

Quantitative analyses of this binding agree well with the number of complement receptors per RBC. In vitro \"whole-blood\" model experiments indicate heteropolymer-facilitated binding of antigens to RBCs is rapid and stable at 37 degrees C. It may be possible to extend these prototype experiments to the in vivo situation and use heteropolymer-attached RBCs for the safe and rapid binding, neutralization, and removal from the circulation of pathogenic antigens associated with infectious disease.\r"

By blocking the central inputs of the depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs) with L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate, we were able to eliminate the contribution of the feedback synapse and to demonstrate the postsynaptic light response in DBCs mediated by the HC-DBC feedforward synapse.

  ".W": "The protooncogene ras acts as a component of signal-transduction networks in many kinds of cells. The ras gene product (p21) is a GTP-binding protein, and the activity of the protein is regulated by bound GDP/GTP. Recent studies have shown that a certain class of growth factors stimulates the formation of active p21-GTP complexes in fibroblasts and that oncogene products with enhanced tyrosine kinase activities have a similar effect on ras p21. We have measured the ratio of active GTP-bound p21 to total p21 in several lymphoid and myeloid cell lines in order to understand the role of ras in the proliferation of these cells. Interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-3, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) enhance the formation of the active p21.GTP, whereas IL-4 has no effect on p21-bound GDP/GTP. These results strongly suggest that ras p21 acts as a transducer of signals from IL-2, IL-3, and GM-CSF, but not from IL-4.\r"

In the present experiments, we have examined whether the translational control of rp mRNAs is attributable to the distinctive features of their 5' untranslated region, in particular to the oligopyrimidine tract adjacent to the cap structure. Murine lymphosarcoma cells were transfected with chimeric genes consisting of selected regions of rp mRNA fused to non-rp mRNA segments, and the translational efficiency of the resulting chimeric mRNAs was assessed in cells that either were growing normally or were growth-arrested by glucocorticoid treatment. We observed that translational control of rpL32 mRNA was abolished when its 5' untranslated region was replaced by that of beta-actin. At the same time, human growth hormone (hGH) mRNA acquired the typical behavior of rp mRNAs when it was preceded by the first 61 nucleotides of rpL30 mRNA or the first 29 nucleotides of rpS16 mRNA. Moreover, the translational control of rpS16-hGH mRNA was abolished by the substitution of purines into the pyrimidine tract or by shortening it from eight to six residues with a concomitant cytidine----uridine change at the 5' terminus. These results indicate that the 5'-terminal pyrimidine tract plays a critical role in the translational control mechanism. Possible factors that might interact with this translational cis regulatory element are discussed.\r"

The expression of the cryIA(b) gene was compared to partially modified (3% nucleotide difference) and to fully modified (21% nucleotide difference) cryIA(b) and cryIA(c) genes in tobacco and tomato. The modified genes increased the frequency of plants that produced the proteins at quantities sufficient to control insects and dramatically increased the levels of these proteins. Among the most highly expressing transformed plants for each gene, the plants with the partially modified cryIA(b) gene had a 10-fold higher level of insect control protein and plants with the fully modified cryIA(b) had a 100-fold higher level of CryIA(b) protein compared with the wild-type gene. Similar results were obtained with the fully modified cryIA(c) gene in plants. Specific sequences of the partially modified cryIA(b) gene were analyzed for their ability to affect cryIA(b) gene expression in tobacco. The DNA sequence of a single region was identified as important to the improvement of plant expression of the cryIA(b) gene. The increased levels of cryIA(b) mRNA were not directly proportional to the increased levels of CryIA(b) protein in plants transformed with the modified cryIA(b) genes, indicating that the nucleotide sequence of these genes had an effect in improving their translational efficiency in plants.\r"

The predominant product was crosslinked between subunits within a tetramer and had a Mr of 64,000; no higher Mr species were formed. This product had one crosslink per tetramer located between the NH2 termini of its alpha chains, as established by HPLC analysis, amino acid analysis, Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry. This crosslinked derivative had a slightly increased oxygen affinity [P50 = 9 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133 Pa); P50 for unmodified hemoglobin = 11 mmHg], and the retention time of this derivative in the circulation of rats was 2.9 and 3.3 hr at two hemoglobin concentrations (7 g/dl and 14 g/dl, respectively). The half-life of an uncrosslinked carboxymethylated derivative, which has a low oxygen affinity (P50 = 28 mmHg), was 0.6 and 0.7 hr under the same conditions. Therefore, prolongation of the plasma-retention time of infused hemoglobin is dependent on the crosslinking of the tetramer but independent of the oxygen affinity of the derivative.\r"

The Tc4 transposable element family is present at about 20 copies per haploid genome in the C. elegans Bristol and Bergerac strains. Although Tc4 transposition events have not been observed in these wild-type strains, we have identified Tc4 transposition events in the mut-2 mutant strain TR679, in which the elements Tc1 and Tc3 also transpose at a higher frequency than in the wild type. We determined the sequence of one Tc4 element. This 1.6-kilobase element contains almost perfect inverted terminal repeats of 774 base pairs (bp) with a 57-bp unique internal sequence. Tc4 is a fold-back element, but its long inverted terminal repeats, unlike those of the fold-back elements of other organisms, do not consist of multiple short repeats. In the two cases studied, Tc4 insertion resulted in duplication of a TNA trinucleotide target site. The family of Tc4 elements differs from other C. elegans transposable element families in structure, degree of structural heterogeneity, and target-site specificity.\r"

From preliminary data, the most antigenic octapeptide in the carboxyl-terminal 120 amino acid residues of Ro/SSA shares seven of eight amino acids with the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the Indiana serotype of vesicular stomatitis virus. A sequence comparison of Ro/SSA and N has unexpectedly revealed six small peptides shared by Ro/SSA and N. Fine specificity analysis with 531 octapeptides from the Ro/SSA sequence demonstrates that five of the six shared small peptides are bound by anti-Ro/SSA (P = 0.00017). A more powerful association is not present in 12,476 protein sequences similarly evaluated. In addition, the inclusion of single-residue gaps in Ro/SSA enlarges the sequence similarity of Ro/SSA and N for three of the five small shared antigenic peptides. This additional level of sequence similarity between Ro/SSA and N is unlikely to be the result of chance (P less than 0.0002). While a number of models may explain these data, including independent immune responses to N and Ro/SSA, these results are also consistent with anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies being the consequence of a specific viral exposure.\r"

Both previously infected animals promptly developed an anamnestic humoral antibody response after the first dose, and the uninfected animal developed a primary humoral response to the first dose and then an anamnestic response to the second dose. Although HIV had been recovered repeatedly from the seropositive animals, they became persistently virus-culture negative at the time of or just before the first inoculation of the immunogen. Intravenous challenge with 40 chimpanzee-infectious-doses of a heterologous HIV strain (HIVIIIB) was done 4 mo after the third inoculation in the three treated chimpanzees and in an untreated control animal (A-189a). The immunized naive animal (A-36) and the unimmunized control (A-189a) became infected, and virus has been isolated from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells for greater than 2 yr after challenge. However, the two previously infected chimpanzees (A-3 and A-86c) resisted challenge and have remained virus negative by peripheral blood mononuclear cell cocultivation for greater than 2 yr of observation after challenge; moreover, no evidence of reinfection was detectable by PCR. Despite the in vivo resistance, however, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the resistant animals (A-3, A-86c) remained susceptible to infection by HIV in vitro. These findings reveal that a state of immunity can develop and/or be induced to control and/or prevent HIV infection in the chimpanzees. In the absence of any detectable level of neutralizing antibody in A-3 and a low level in A-86c, the patterns of the responses to challenge seen in the four animals suggest that the cell-mediated immune mechanism must have played a significant role in the resistant chimpanzees both in control of their HIV infection and in their resistance to challenge.\r"

PC3 is also induced with similar kinetics, but at lower levels, by membrane depolarization (both in vivo and in vitro) and epidermal growth factor.

In vivo it is found expressed in tissues, such as brain at embryonic day 13.5, placenta, amnion, and spleen, which are proliferating and/or differentiating.

We evaluated the cytotoxic activity of immunotoxins composed of monoclonal antibody B3 coupled to native Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) or two recombinant forms of Pseudomonas exotoxin, PEArg57 or LysPE40, a form of PE with a deletion of the cell binding domain. All three conjugates were cytotoxic to human cell lines expressing the B3 antigen on their surface. The survival of each of the three immunotoxins in the circulation of mice was determined after administering the immunotoxin i.v. The half-life in blood of B3-PE and B3-PEArg57 was 20 hr, whereas the half-life of B3-LysPE40 was 4 hr. The short half-life of B3-LysPE40 may be due to the absence of domain I of PE. To determine the therapeutic effects of the three immunotoxins, they were given intraperitoneally to nude mice bearing subcutaneous A431 tumors. All three immunotoxins caused complete regression of 50-mm3 tumors with no toxic effects to the animals at therapeutic doses. Furthermore, substantial regression was also noted with much larger tumors. Our data indicate that the monoclonal antibody B3, when coupled to PE or recombinant forms of PE, may be useful for the treatment of tumors expressing B3 antigen. The therapeutic window was largest with B3-LysPE40, which can be administered in higher doses because it lacks sequences in domain I of PE that enable PE to bind to nontarget cells.\r"

This effect was specific to memory processing since the peptide did not cause amnesia when injected 24 hr after training nor did it disturb storage or retrieval of older memories. Shorter fragments of the amyloid beta protein consisting of residues 12-28, 18-28, and 12-20 also were amnestic when given intracerebroventricularly, residues 12-20 being least effective. The hippocampus, a brain structure importantly involved in learning and memory, consistently shows severe pathological changes and deposition of amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease. Immediate post-training bilateral intrahippocampal injection of [Gln11]beta-(1-28) produced amnesia at much lower doses than did [Gln11]beta-(1-28) injected intracerebroventricularly. Thus these experimental results suggest a possible direct role of amyloid beta protein or fragments thereof in an aspect of the spectrum of cognitive deficit in Alzheimer disease.\r"

RecBCD enzyme initiates the process by unwinding the linear double-stranded DNA to produce single-stranded DNA, which is trapped by SSB and RecA. RecA uses this single-stranded DNA to catalyze the invasion of a supercoiled double-stranded DNA molecule, forming a homologously paired joint molecule. At low RecBCD enzyme concentrations, the rate-limiting step is the unwinding of duplex DNA by RecBCD, whereas at higher RecBCD concentrations, the rate-limiting step is RecA-catalyzed strand invasion. The behavior of mutant RecA proteins in this in vitro reaction parallels their in vivo phenotypes, suggesting that this reaction may define biochemical steps that occur during homologous recombination by the RecBCD pathway in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor have previously been identified as survival factors with distinctive activities for the density-inhibited quiescent BALB/c 3T3 murine fibroblasts. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), like PDGF, renders quiescent BALB/c 3T3 cells competent to respond to epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor, which mediate cell-cycle traverse through G1 into S phase [Stiles, C. D., Pledger, W. J., VanWyk, J. J., Antoniades, H. N. & Scher, C. D. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 1279-1283]. We now show that FGF possess marked cell survival-enhancing activity distinctive from that of PDGF. Both acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) markedly enhance short-term (3-hr) survival of quiescent cells. bFGF is the more active of the two factors and shows marked long-term (20-hr) survival-promoting activity alone, whereas aFGF requires heparin for long-term activity. Protection by bFGF or aFGF plus heparin is not associated with cell-cycle traverse into S phase. Both the short-term (3-hr) and long-term (20-hr) protective actions of aFGF and bFGF critically depend on protein synthesis, whereas those of PDGF do not. The accumulated evidence shows that several growth factors can contribute to maintenance of the integrity of quiescent murine fibroblasts and that their action can involve protein kinase A- and C-mediated processes as well as protein synthesis. Different growth factors display distinctive modes of action.\r"

Chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum counter the drug by expelling it rapidly via an unknown mechanism. In the absence of explicit biochemical knowledge of this efflux mechanism, reverse genetics provides a powerful approach to the molecular basis of chloroquine resistance. Here we report genetic linkage analysis in which 85 restriction fragment length polymorphism markers were used to examine inheritance of the 14 P. falciparum chromosomes in a laboratory cross between a chloroquine-resistant and a chloroquine-sensitive parasite. Inheritance data from 16 independent recombinant progeny show that the rapid efflux, chloroquine-resistant phenotype is governed by a single locus within an approximately 400-kilobase region of chromosome 7. Identification and characterization of genes within this region should lead to an understanding of the chloroquine-resistance mechanism.\r"

Anti-carcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody T84.66 was conjugated to 57Co-VFC with full retention of immunological activity. Biodistribution studies in nude mice bearing carcinoembryonic antigen-producing tumors showed excellent tumor localization of 57Co-VFC-T84.66. The accumulation of radionuclide in normal liver was low and independent of dose, which may reflect the stability of the radionuclide complex.

In this study, we compared the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the HCV genome obtained from plasma collected in 1977 with that collected in 1990. We find that the two HCV isolates differ at 123 of the 4923 (2.50%) nucleotides sequenced. We estimate that the mutation rate of the H strain of HCV is approximately 1.92 x 10(-3) base substitutions per genome site per year. The nucleotide changes were exclusively base substitutions and were unevenly distributed throughout the genome. A relatively high rate of change was observed in the region of the HCV genome that corresponds to the non-structural protein 1 gene region of flaviviruses, where 44 of 960 (4.6%) nucleotides were different. Within this region there was a 39-nucleotide domain in which 28.2% of the nucleotides differed between the two isolates. In contrast, relatively few nucleotide substitutions were observed in the 5' noncoding region, where only 2 of 276 (0.7%) nucleotides were different. Our results suggest that the mutation rate of the HCV genome is similar to that of other RNA viruses and that genes appear to be evolving at different rates within the virus genome.\r"

The molecular mechanism of action of this differentiation factor is not known, and as a first step we have examined BMP 2B-responsive cells for the presence of specific cellular binding proteins. Using 125I-labeled BMP 2B, specific high-affinity binding sites for recombinant human BMP 2B on MC3T3 E1 osteoblast-like cells as well as on NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were identified. Platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta did not compete for the binding of radiolabeled BMP 2B. The binding of BMP 2B is a time- and temperature-dependent process. Chemical crosslinking of radiolabeled BMP showed two components (apparent size, 200 and 70 kDa in MC3T3 E1 cells and 200 and 90 kDa in NIH 3T3 cells). A minor component at 60 kDa was also detected in both cell lines. Scatchard analysis of the binding data showed a high-affinity receptor with an apparent dissociation constant of 128 +/- 40 pM in MC3T3 E1 cells. These data demonstrate specific, high-affinity cell-surface binding proteins for BMP 2B.\r"

Because the GnRH neuron originates from the olfactory placode and migrates to the hypothalamus during development, central hypogonadism in humans could be caused by failure in normal migration of GnRH neurons to the hypothalamus. We report that in transgenic mice expression of the simian virus 40 T antigen, driven by the promoter of human GnRH gene, resulted in central hypogonadism due to an arrest in neuronal migration during development and tumor formation along the migratory pathway. This system appears to be an important animal model of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in humans. Additionally, olfactory bulb tumors from these animals were dispersed, and a GnRH-secreting neuronal cell line (GN cell line) was established.\r"

  ".W": "Human growth hormone (hGH) binds to both the growth hormone (GH) and the prolactin (PRL) receptors. Competition experiments followed by mutational analysis show that the epitope on hGH for hPRL receptor consists of strong determinants in the middle of helix 1 (comprising residues His-18, His-21, and Phe-25), a loop region (including Ile-58, Ser-62, and Asn-63), and the central portion of helix 4 (containing residues Arg-167, Lys-168, Lys-172, Glu-174, Phe-176, and Arg-178). When these residues are mapped on a structural model of hGH, they form a patch that overlaps but is not identical to that previously determined for the hGH receptor. Three of these side chains (His-18, His-21, and Glu-174) are ligands for binding Zn2+, which is required for high-affinity hGH-hPRL receptor complex formation. By introducing pairs of mutations into hGH that exploit the zinc dependency for hPRL receptor binding and remove side chains in the nonoverlapping regions, we have shifted the binding preference toward the hGH receptor by a factor of 34,000 or toward the hPRL receptor by a factor of 150 without substantial loss in binding affinity for the preferred receptor. The energetic effects of the individual mutations are additive within the double mutants, suggesting that each functions independently and does not introduce gross perturbations in structure. Such receptor-selective variants of hGH should be useful molecular probes to link specific receptor binding events to the various biological activities of hGH.\r"

We found that in barn owls (Tyto alba) raised without vision, although a tectal map of head movement develops, its topography and alignment with the map of visual (and auditory) space are abnormal. The results demonstrate that during early life vision is necessary either to maintain or to guide the development of a normal tectal motor map.\r"

Since many receptors are phosphorylated after ligand binding, we asked if components of the mIg receptor complexes were tyrosine-phosphorylated after mIg crosslinking. Both mIgM and mIgD are noncovalently associated with at least two other proteins. mIgM is associated with the MB-1 protein, which is disulfide-linked to a protein designated Ig-beta. mIgD is not associated with MB-1 but is with IgD-alpha, which is also disulfide-linked to Ig-beta. Using immunoprecipitation with a specific anti-MB-1 antiserum followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, we found that crosslinking mIgM stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of MB-1, Ig-beta, and a previously unidentified 54-kDa polypeptide associated with MB-1. In mature splenic B cells that express both mIgM and mIgD, mIgM crosslinking stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the 32-kDa MB-1 protein, whereas mIgD crosslinking stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of MB-1-related proteins of 33 and 34 kDa. The 32-kDa MB-1 protein was only associated with mIgM, whereas the 33- and 34-kDa MB-1-related proteins were specifically associated with mIgD and are most likely IgD-alpha. Thus, crosslinking either mIgM or mIgD stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation only of the MB-1-related proteins associated with that receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The three-dimensional structure of human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been determined by x-ray crystallography and refined to a crystallographic residual of 17.4% at 2.2-A resolution. The structure was initially solved at a nominal resolution of 2.8 A by multiple isomorphous replacement using three heavy-atom derivatives. Although the map clearly showed the overall fold of the molecule, electron density was not observed for the first 19 amino-terminal and the last 3 carboxyl-terminal amino acids, suggesting that they are disordered. The bFGF crystals were grown from 2.0 M ammonium sulfate at pH 8.1 in space group P1 with cell dimensions a = 30.9 A, b = 33.4 A, c = 35.9 A, alpha = 59.5 degrees, beta = 72.0 degrees, and gamma = 75.6 degrees. There is one molecule per unit cell and the crystals diffract to spacings beyond 1.9 A. The overall structure of bFGF can be described as a trigonal pyramid with a fold very similar to that reported for interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 1 alpha, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. An apparent sulfate ion is bound within a basic region on the surface of the molecule and has a ligands the main-chain amide of Arg-120 and the side chains of Asn-27, Arg-120, and Lys-125. This is suggested as the presumed binding site for heparin. Residues 106-115, which are presumed to bind to the bFGF receptor [Baird, A., Schubert, D., Ling, N. & Guillemin, R. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 2324-2328], include an irregular loop that extends somewhat from the surface of the protein and is about 25 A from the presumed heparin binding site. The backbone structure of this putative receptor-binding loop is very similar, although not identical, to the corresponding region of interleukin 1 beta.\r"

The topology of bFGF is identical to that of interleukin 1 beta, showing that although the two proteins share only 10% sequence identity, bFGF, interleukin 1, and their homologs comprise a family of structurally related mitogenic factors. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure in light of functional studies of bFGF suggests that the receptor binding site and the positively charged heparin binding site correspond to adjacent but separate loci on the beta-barrel.\r"

It lacks ZO-1 epitopes recognized by both monoclonal antibodies and a polyclonal serum to ZO-1, since it is not detectable in immunoblots of either whole cell extracts or ZO-1 immunoprecipitates. Also, it exhibits a peptide map different from that of ZO-1 on one-dimensional \"Cleveland gels.\" Moreover, because the kinetics of appearance of newly synthesized 160-kDa polypeptide in anti-ZO-1 immunoprecipitates is much slower than that of ZO-1, its presence in immunoprecipitates cannot be simply explained by degradation of ZO-1 during cell lysis. Like ZO-1, the 160-kDa polypeptide seems to be a cytoplasmic peripheral membrane protein. It cannot be labeled by two different cell surface labeling reagents. It can be extracted from the membrane by high salt concentration in the absence of detergents. As expected for a protein complex, the 160-kDa polypeptide and ZO-1 turn over with similar kinetics. We propose that the 160-kDa polypeptide is a component of the tight junction.\r"

  ".W": "DNA methylation abnormalities occur consistently in human neoplasia including widespread hypomethylation and more recently recognized local increases in DNA methylation that hold potential for gene inactivation events. To study this imbalance further, we have cloned and localized to chromosome 19 a portion of the human DNA methyltransferase gene that codes for the enzyme catalyzing DNA methylation. Expression of this gene is low in normal human cells, significantly increased (30- to 50-fold by PCR analysis) in virally transformed cells, and strikingly elevated in human cancer cells (several hundredfold). In comparison to colon mucosa from patients without neoplasia, median levels of DNA methyltransferase transcripts are 15-fold increased in histologically normal mucosa from patients with cancers or the benign polyps that can precede cancers, 60-fold increased in the premalignant polyps, and greater than 200-fold increased in the cancers. Thus, increases in DNA methyltransferase gene expression precede development of colonic neoplasia and continue during progression of colonic neoplasms. These increases may play a role in the genetic instability of cancer and mark early events in cell transformation.\r"

  ".W": "IIIGlc is a signal-transducing phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system of Escherichia coli. The secondary structure of IIIGlc is determined by heteronuclear (15N, 13C) three-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Sequential, medium-range, and long-range nuclear Overhauser effects seen in NMR spectra are used to elucidate 11 antiparallel beta-strands and four helical segments. The medium-range nuclear Overhauser effect patterns suggest that the helices are either distorted alpha-helices or are of the 3(10) class. The amino acids separating the active-site histidine residues (His75 and His90) form two strands (Ala76-Ser81 and Val85-Phe91) of a six-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet that brings His90 and His75 in close proximity. Sequence similarities in IIIGlc and several other sugar-transport proteins suggest that the histidine residues within these proteins may be arranged in a similar manner. The 18-residue N-terminal peptide that precedes beta-strand Thr19-Ile22 in native IIIGlc is disordered and does not interact with the rest of the protein. Furthermore, removal of the N-terminal heptapeptide by a specific endopeptidase does not affect the structure of the remaining protein, thus explaining the phospho-acceptor activity of modified IIIGlc with the phospho-histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein of this system.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factors beta (TGF-beta s) are potent inhibitors of epithelial cell growth in culture and might play a similar role in vivo. Several studies have suggested that acquisition of TGF-beta resistance is an important step in epithelial tumor development. Here, we show that resistance to TGF-beta 1 growth inhibition can be induced by transformation of keratinocytes with the E1A, but not the ras, oncogene. Mutational analysis revealed that these effects closely correlate with the ability of E1A proteins to bind to the retinoblastoma gene product (p105) as well as to three other cellular proteins (p60, p107, and p300). Only partial resistance to TGF-beta 1 growth inhibition was elicited by E1A mutants that bind to a subset of proteins, whereas complete resistance was induced by E1A mutants that bind to all four proteins together. Total protection against TGF-beta growth inhibition was also induced by concomitant introduction into cells of an E1A mutant binding to the p60/p105/p107 proteins and one binding to p300. In parallel with these effects, epidermal transglutaminase, a marker of keratinocyte differentiation, was induced by TGF-beta in control but not in E1A-transformed cells. TGF-beta 1 receptor levels were only partially down-modulated by an intact E1A gene and not significantly affected by the various truncated mutants. Thus, the ability of E1A to induce TGF-beta resistance depends on its ability to bind, and presumably inactivate, several cellular proteins that may be involved in transmission of the TGF-beta signal and seem to act downstream from its receptor(s).\r"

  ".U": "91195379\r", 
  ".W": "We described previously a mutation in maize, hcf106, caused by the insertion of a Mu1 transposon. When the Mu transposon system is in an active phase, hcf106 conditions a nonphotosynthetic, pale green phenotype. However, when the Mu system is inactive (a state correlated with hypermethylation of Mu elements), the plant adopts a normal phenotype despite the continued presence of the transposon within the gene. The molecular mechanisms that mediate this suppression of the mutant phenotype have now been investigated. We show here that the Mu element responsible for the hcf106 lesion lies within sequences encoding the 5'-untranslated leader of the Hcf106 mRNA. When the Mu transposon system is active, this insertion interferes with the accumulation of mRNA from the hcf106 allele. However, when Mu is inactive, mRNA similar in size and abundance to that transcribed from the normal allele accumulates. These transcripts initiate at many sites throughout a 70-base-pair region, within and immediately downstream of the Mu1 insertion. Thus, an unusual promoter spanning the downstream junction between Mu1 and Hcf106 substitutes for the normal Hcf106 promoter but only when Mu is inactive. The pattern of mRNA accumulation in different organs and in response to light suggests that the activity of this promoter is conditional not only upon the phase of Mu activity, but also upon signals that regulate the normal Hcf106 promoter.\r"

In the leukemias and lymphomas, it appears that the activation of cellular oncogenes is important. The genes involved are present in all normal cells and are often associated with cell growth and regulation. When activated, they act in a dominant fashion to cause a cell to express the malignant phenotype. There is increasing evidence that in solid tumors, a more important mechanism may be the loss of a suppressor gene. The classic example is retinoblastoma, in which the retinoblastoma gene has been cloned and is also found to be associated with several other common cancers including sarcomas and small cell lung cancer. It is likely to be one of a family of such genes. It may well be that the activation of one or more oncogenes or the loss of one or more suppressor genes, or both, is required for a tumor to progress from initiation through promotion to a metastasizing malignancy.\r"

In each of five patients with hemochromatosis, the pancreas had low signal intensity, but splenic signal intensity was decreased in only one. In contrast, only three of the 16 patients with RE iron overload had low pancreatic signal intensity, while all of these patients either had low splenic signal intensity (n = 14) or previously underwent splenectomy (n = 2). Distinction among these causes of iron deposition is clinically important because parenchymal iron overload from hemochromatosis may produce significant tissue damage, while the RE iron of transfusions and rhabdomyolysis is of little clinical consequence.\r"

The iron concentrations in surgical wedge biopsy samples of the liver, which varied between 3 and 9 mg/g of wet weight (normal, less than or equal to 0.5 mg/g), correlated well (r = .93, P less than or equal to .0001) with the preoperative in vivo hepatic 1/T2 measurements. The CT attenuation did not correlate with liver iron concentration. Quantitative MR imaging is a readily available noninvasive method for the assessment of hepatic iron concentration in iron-overloaded patients, reducing the need for needle biopsies of the liver.\r"

All specimens were imaged with a 1.5-T superconducting magnet within 21/2 hours (on average) after hysterectomy. Comparison of histologic findings with measurements obtained at MR imaging indicates that the JZ represents the innermost layer of the myometrium. A threefold increase in percentage of nuclear area was found in the JZ in comparison with the outer myometrium, reflecting an increase in both size and number of nuclei. No difference in distribution of common components of the extracellular space (collagen, laminin, and fibronectin) was found between the two layers.\r"

To better define the histologic correlates of these diagnostically significant zones, T2-weighted MR images of 17 in vivo and 13 extirpated human uteri were compared with histologic sections of 17 uteri stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Mallory trichrome, and immunofluorescence staining for actin. Morphometric and electron microscopic observations of uterine surgical specimens were also made. The observations indicate that both the junctional zone and the subserosal zone consist of compact smooth muscle fibers with little extracellular matrix compared with the myometrium proper. Also, the junctional zone is divided into a compact region and a transitional region. The compact region correlates well with the hypointense MR appearance of the junctional zone.\r"

Unenhanced CT attenuation coefficient and size were analyzed electronically in 55 patients with 66 adrenal masses. There were 38 nonhyperfunctioning adenomas in 33 patients and 28 malignant masses in 22 patients. Primary extraadrenal malignancies were present in 45 of the 55 patients. Three blinded readers characterized the adrenal masses using a seven-point scale of certainty. Results were subjected to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The mean CT attenuation coefficient for benign adrenal masses was -2.2 HU +/- 16.0 and was significantly different from the mean for malignant lesions (28.9 HU +/- 10.6). The area under the ROC curve for CT attenuation coefficients (0.91 +/- 0.04) was significantly larger than that for lesion size (0.84 +/- 0.05) or best observer interpretation (0.84 +/- 0.05). A threshold CT attenuation value of 0 HU had a sensitivity-to-specificity ratio of 47%:100% for characterizing benign adrenal masses, whereas a threshold attenuation of 10 HU had a ratio of 79%:96%.\r"

To detect changes in the Doppler waveform associated with ARF and determine whether Doppler US can provide significant diagnostic information not available with standard US, 91 patients with ARF were studied to determine a mean resistive index (RI) for each patient. Forty-six patients had acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with a mean RI +/- 1 standard deviation of .85 +/- .06, which was significantly higher than the mean RI of .67 +/- .09 in 30 patients with prerenal ARF (P less than .01). Fifteen patients had ARF due to non-ATN intrinsic renal disease (mean RI, .74 +/- .13). An elevated RI (greater than or equal to .75) occurred in 91% of patients with ATN versus only 20% of patients with prerenal azotemia. Patients with severe liver disease (hepatorenal syndrome) are a subset of those with prerenal ARF that accounted for most of the elevated RIs in this group. The study demonstrates that intrarenal Doppler US allows detection of changes associated with ARF far more often than standard US. More important, Doppler US may be helpful in distinguishing ATN from prerenal azotemia.\r"

Proof of the presence or absence of obstruction was obtained at interventional procedures in 18 patients and at clinical follow-up in 17. Thirteen kidneys were obstructed (mean RI, .81 +/- .06), while 22 had nonobstructive dilatation (mean RI, .66 +/- .07). The RI difference was statistically significant (P less than or equal to .01). Of 21 kidneys with a normal RI, only two had obstruction. In both of these, the obstruction was associated with a significant peritransplant collection of fluid due to a ureteral leak. In the seven obstructed transplanted kidneys with follow-up, the mean RI was .82 +/- .06 before nephrostomy and .67 +/- .05 after nephrostomy. Obstruction was a common cause of an elevated RI (greater than or equal to .75). Other causes of transplant dysfunction can be associated with an elevated RI and nonobstructed dilatation. More important, a normal RI should strongly argue against obstruction unless a ureteral leak is also present.\r"

Major complications occurred in two of the 252 biopsies (0.8%): One hemopneumothorax necessitated drainage with a chest tube, and one hemorrhage necessitated transfusion. No patient required surgical exploration because of a complication of the biopsy. Specimens were adequate for accurate histopathologic diagnosis in 248 of 252 procedures (98.4%).

The indications were confined to complex lesions, including residual stenoses and dissections after percutaneous procedures or previous surgery in the iliac artery lesions, and long-segment (mean, 13.5 cm) occlusions with inadequate response to percutaneous recanalization in the femoropopliteal artery lesions. In the iliac artery group, after stent placement, 96% of the lesions were patent at a mean follow-up of 16 months (range, 6-30 months). In the femoropopliteal artery group, of 11 patients available for follow-up, only six had patent stents at 7-26 months (mean, 20 months). Four of these six patients required one to three secondary interventions. Self-expanding endoprostheses are of great value in complex iliac artery lesions where simple balloon dilation is insufficient. Stent placement for long femoral artery lesions should be performed with utmost reserve, and the extent of stent placement should be as short as possible.\r"

Complications included a case of massive cholesterol embolization and a case of unexplained transient hematuria, proteinuria, and deterioration of renal function. At repeat angiography of seven renal arteries after stent placement, one was occluded and required thrombolysis and dilation. Another showed restenosis due to shortening of the stent and required redilation and, later, placement of another stent. This stent became occluded after 1 month. In this patient and in three other cases, angiography disclosed tissue buildup in the stent but without significant stenosis after this short-term follow-up.

Follow-up consisted of four mammographic examinations during a 3- or 3.5-year period. Clinical outcome was ascertained in each case after the study period, whether or not patients complied with the protocol. Probably benign lesions were subsequently found to be malignant in 17 cases (positive predictive value for cancer, 0.5%). Fifteen of the 17 cancers were identified by means of interval mammographic change prior to development of a palpable mass; all 17 were stage 0 or stage 1 tumors. All 17 women who had cancer currently show no evidence of tumor recurrence (median duration of follow-up, 5 years). These results should help establish the validity of managing mammographically detected, probably benign lesions with periodic mammographic surveillance. By decreasing the number of biopsies of benign lesions and thereby substantially reducing costs, this approach may help overcome a major barrier to widespread use of mammographic screening.\r"

A fluid-filled, distended duodenum seen at US examination in infants is a nonspecific sign of duodenal obstruction, as well as one of the signs of midgut malrotation. In addition, dilated, thick-walled bowel loops, mainly to the right of the spine, and peritoneal fluid were found at abdominal US examinations of three infants with midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus. In one infant with uncomplicated midgut malrotation, only signs of duodenal obstruction were present. The findings at US of duodenal obstruction associated with thickened bowel loops to the right of the spine and peritoneal fluid should lead the sonologist to suspect midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus, a potentially fatal condition, and an upper gastrointestinal series should then be performed to confirm the diagnosis.\r"

CT findings included small bowel thickening (range, 5-10 mm) (n = 20), colonic wall thickening (range, 6-15 mm) (n = 15), and small bowel dilation (n = 5). Mesenteric abnormalities such as adenopathy and focal fatty proliferation were seen in 11 to 18 patients, respectively. Extraluminal complications were easily identified with CT. Abscesses were noted in seven patients, inflammatory masses in four, and perirectal or perineal inflammation in 10. Fistulas were detected in four patients. The authors conclude that CT should be the initial imaging study performed in children with known Crohn disease and a changing pattern of clinical symptoms.\r"

The authors found that (a) STIR imaging need not be time consuming, (b) fat suppression can be accomplished at shorter TR by using shorter TI, and (c) short-TR fast STIR imaging is sensitive to enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine.\r"

Upward vertical forces along the top of the bore were also measured. The horizontal forces 40 cm in from the portals of the 0.5- and 1.5-T magnets were 70%-80% greater than the horizontal forces at the portal. The upward vertical force at the top of the 0.3-T magnet bore, 63 cm in from the portal, was 20 times the horizontal force at the portal and was twice the maximum force measured in the 0.5-T magnet. The maximum force was not at the portal.\r"

To reduce this problem, the authors investigated the process of removing labeled MoAs from plasma at selected times by means of extracorporeal immunoadsorption. In seven patients with either lung or breast carcinoma, an indium-111-labeled murine antibody was intravenously administered. Six to 24 hours later, immunoadsorption was performed by passing the patients' plasma through a goat anti-mouse antibody column connected to a plasma separator. Whole-body computer images were obtained before and after the treatment. Blood pool activity in the images was reduced by an average of 59%, while tumor activity dropped by only 10%. Tumor-to-blood activity ratios therefore more than doubled, improving by an average of 121% between the pre- and posttreatment image sets. Eight of 12 areas of known disease and three areas of unknown but later documented disease were detected after the immunoadsorption process, while the three areas of unknown disease and three of the areas of known disease were not detected in the preclearance images. Thus, the feasibility of using extracorporeal immunoadsorption to improve MoA imaging of tumors was demonstrated.\r"

Chondromyxoid fibroma may occur anywhere in the skeleton, but almost half of the cases occur around the knee. The possibility of chondromyxoid fibroma should always be considered when a focal bone lesion is evaluated that has geographic bone destruction, a sclerotic rim, lobulated margins, and septation. The diagnosis of chondromyxoid fibroma is most likely when the patient is in the 2nd decade of life.\r"

In addition to the poor sensitivities and specificities, there was substantial intra- and interobserver variability. Assuming that the shoulders of the asymptomatic volunteers were normal, the specificities were 100.0% and 88.9% for observers A and B respectively. In this small study, axial MR imaging was relatively insensitive and nonspecific in the evaluation of labral lesions. Further study will be necessary to determine the utility and limits of MR imaging in this regard.\r"

Pain developed in seven hips in four patients; in each hip, the MR images showed abnormality before the onset of symptoms. Plain radiographs showed abnormality in all hips that became painful; however, the plain radiographs of 17 of 18 asymptomatic hips in which MR imaging showed evidence of AVN showed no abnormality over a mean follow-up period of 16 months. All MR lesions in the symptomatic hips were larger than those in the asymptomatic cohort. MR lesions in seven hips (in five asymptomatic patients) regressed in size; in six hips, the MR images returned to normal. The findings suggest that some patients with MR evidence of AVN of the hip have spontaneous improvement.\r"

Maximum decrease in relaxation times of marrow occurred within 1-24 hours after intravenous administration; thereafter, relaxation times slowly returned to normal within 7 days. In vivo MR imaging of rabbits and rats confirmed that USPIO decreases signal intensity of red and yellow marrow. The decrease was most marked with gradient echo pulse sequences. An animal model of intramedullary tumor demonstrated the potential of USPIO to enable differentiation between tumor and normal red marrow. USPIO-enhanced MR imaging improves detection of smaller tumors and allows differentiation of tumor deposits from islands of hyperplastic or normal red marrow.\r"

With a gradient-recalled acquisition, sequential images of 10 hips in five healthy dogs were obtained for 14 minutes after an intravenous bolus injection of 0.2 mmol of gadopentetate dimeglumine per kilogram. The study was repeated after unilateral arterial embolization of major femoral vessels. Radiolabeled microspheres were injected before and after vessel occlusion. After unilateral embolization, statistically significant differences in enhancement were observed between embolized and control sides (eg, 31% vs 83% average peak enhancement in the femoral neck). There was a high correlation (r = .81 [average]) between the MR data and the microsphere blood flow measurements. The postembolization data indicate that contrast-enhanced fast MR imaging may allow early detection of abnormal bone marrow flow. This technique may be valuable in evaluating patients at risk for avascular necrosis of the femoral head, especially in posttraumatic cases.\r"

In patients with optic neuritis, the technique was sensitive, allowing detection of 29 of 34 visual-evoked-response-confirmed lesions on T2-weighted lipid-suppressed images. There were no false-positive studies. Sensitivity for detection of optic neuritis was 89%; specificity, 100%; and accuracy, 86%. The technique was also useful for depicting inflammatory changes in the orbital apex due to fungal abscess and confirming the fatty nature of an extraconal dermoid tumor. A slight increase in noise and mild accentuation of susceptibility effects at interfaces of air, bone, and brain did not degrade images significantly. The chopper-based technique requires only standard imaging time and has usual spin-echo sensitivity. The results are comparable to short-inversion-time inversion-recovery imaging, without the constraints of sequence limitations or artifacts at fat and water interfaces.\r"

Fourteen of the patients with osteosarcoma showed high-signal-intensity lesions in white matter on T2-weighted images. The interval between the last course of chemotherapy and MR imaging was a factor in this finding, as 12 of 14 patients who underwent examination within 2 years after chemotherapy had a positive finding, as opposed to two of eight patients who underwent examination later. The patients with testicular cancer had normal MR images. The occurrence of MR imaging abnormalities in asymptomatic patients treated with HDMTX for osteogenic sarcoma may be subclinical evidence of treatment-related central nervous system toxicity.\r"

These nine patients had large portal-systemic collateral vessels that were more than 10 mm in diameter. These collateral vessels were receiving blood from the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) in all nine patients. The lesions involved the globus pallidus and portions of internal capsules in a bilateral and symmetric fashion and did not exhibit mass effect.

This technique produced the greatest degree of fat suppression in the phantom study. In six of the patients who had previously undergone surgery, epidural enhancement was more obvious on the fat-suppressed images than on conventional spin-echo images, while in four patients, enhancement was equivalent. The herniated disks in two patients not previously operated on were not enhanced with either technique. Contrast enhancement was universally distinguishable from fat signal and from nonenhancing water-containing tissue on the fat-suppressed images obtained after contrast material administration. This technique may reduce the need for precontrast imaging. Furthermore, postoperative enhancement of nerve roots was more obvious on fat-suppressed images in seven of eight patients. This finding might represent previously undiagnosed degrees of arachnoidal inflammation, which may be a factor in the failed back syndrome.\r"

The module can compress a 1,024-pixel image in 4 seconds in a general-purpose computer system; images can be compressed in 1 second with the addition of a custom-designed data transporter. Copies of the compression module are being installed in the authors' department and in collaborating hospitals for laboratory and clinical evaluation.\r"

Long-term effects included moderate hoarseness (16% of patients) and moderate or severe laryngeal edema (10% of patients). In seven patients who underwent salvage surgery, the complication rate was 29%.

However, other fractionation schemes can be advantageous. When fractionation is altered, the total dose prescribed should lead to equivalent or higher tumor control with the same or less tissue toxicity. To facilitate the use of different fractionation schemes, the authors compiled tables for equivalent biologic doses for late toxicity in normal tissues and tumoricidal doses for epithelial tumors, for various fraction sizes. The linear quadratic model according to Fowler was used. It is shown how these tables should be modified for proliferation of tumors during the course of radiation therapy. The tables make the use of different fractionation schemes easy. They also allow adjustment of total dose if fractionation needs to be changed during the course of treatment.\r"

Fine-needle-aspiration biopsy cytology was performed on tissue obtained with a percutaneous approach via the foramen ovale with use of fluoroscopic guidance and intravenous analgesia during an outpatient procedure. This new application of fine-needle-aspiration biopsy cytology results in decreased patient morbidity and significant cost reduction.\r"

We report a study comparing two groups given lower doses (1.0 or 1.5 microgram) of recombinant-derived vaccine intradermally with a control group given the standard intramuscular dose. Of the 132 randomized medical students and hospital employees, 95 completed the study. Rates of seroconversion and peak antibody titers were comparable, though antibody rose more slowly and fell somewhat faster in the intradermal groups. Increasing the intradermal dose did not improve response. Most intradermal vaccinees (80%) developed small (average 2 to 3 mm) areas of local induration, which faded slowly. Low-dose intradermal vaccination with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine results in high rates of seroconversion (greater than 90% in each protocol) at a cost that will allow individual practitioners and program with limited budgets to offer vaccination.\r"

We gave prednisone to six boys with hemophilia who were infected with HIV in order to study its effects on their clinical status, serum immunoglobulins, lymphocyte populations, and serum HIV antigen concentrations. Most patients had clinical improvement while taking prednisone; platelet counts increased in five, weight increased in four, and adenopathy abated in two patients during the study. Serum IgG concentrations declined in all patients, but there were no significant changes in serum IgA or IgM concentrations. There was no consistent or significant change in the number of percentage of CD3, CD4, CD8, or CD19 lymphocytes. HIV antigen was present in the serum of one patient, and its concentration did not change during the study. None of the patients became HIV antigen seropositive during the study. These results indicate that prednisone administration was associated with clinical improvement without deleterious immunologic effects when given to children with HIV infection.\r"

In order to determine whether this is a population with special perinatal risks, such cases were reviewed over a 4-month period at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. Seventy-one patients were identified who had repeatedly visited the labor observation area near term. Compared with those in the general obstetrics population, these patients had a significantly increased risk of cesarean section for \"failure to progress.\" Repeat visitors to the labor observation area should be viewed as having a high risk for later abnormalities of active labor. Careful management of labor abnormalities in such patients could theoretically lower their need for cesarean section.\r"

Forty-six women who had previous false-positive results from MSAFP testing and 46 who had previous true-negative values participated. Patients were matched for age and socioeconomic status, and all were delivered of normal neonates. A significantly larger number of patients in the group with false-positive results believed they had not understood the MSAFP test than in the group with true-negative results (19.6% vs 0%). Significantly more women in the \"false-positive\" group felt that the test caused anxiety than in the \"true-negative\" group (65.2% vs 17.4%). Fewer women in the false-positive group than in the true-negative group said they would have MSAFP testing in a subsequent pregnancy (58.7% vs 91.3%). Further, the women in the false-positive group were less likely than those in the true-negative group to recommend MSAFP testing to a friend (52.1% vs 80.4%). In patients whose results were false-positive, there was a significant relationship between the patient's perception of understanding the MSAFP test and her attitude toward MSAFP testing.\r"

The study population consisted of inborn, nonreferred, singleton, low-income patients delivered on the nonprivate service after at least five prenatal care visits. Repeat cesarean sections were not included. The mean birth weight for black infants was 214 g less than that for white infants. Black and white mothers differed significantly in marital status, age, and years of education. Black and white mothers also differed significantly in the incidence of chronic hypertension, preeclampsia-eclampsia, anemia, amnionitis, fever on admission, and sexually transmitted diseases. In this population, controlling for maternal demographic characteristics and medical complications of pregnancy produced a predicted mean birth weight for black infants that was 100 g less than that for white infants (53% of the observed racial difference in mean birth weight).\r"

A survey of 200 randomly selected hospitals shows that approximately 40% of the hospitals would not release the original radiograph directly to the patient. Even more important, hospitals will destroy original radiographs without prior notification of the patient. Although statutes and case law support the institutional ownership of the x-ray film, there is a strong legal trend allowing the patient the use of the film. There are potential problems with patient control of the original radiographic image, but there is no evidence that these problems would develop if current hospital policies were changed to allow the patient physical possession of the films. Because there are economic incentives for hospitals to destroy the original radiographs, hospital policies should be liberalized to allow patients to acquire and maintain possession of their own original radiographic images.\r"

Panic disorder preceded or was coincidental with the onset of chronic fatigue in 21 of these patients. In comparison with the rest of the study cohort, significantly more patients with panic disorder had a history of severe depression, including persistent thoughts of death or suicide. Moreover, more patients with panic disorder showed a lifetime tendency to have physical symptoms that remained unexplained after medical evaluation. Our findings suggest that treatable panic disorder is an important contributor not only to major depression and somatization, but also to the etiology and clinical presentation of chronic fatigue in patients in an outpatient practice.\r"
