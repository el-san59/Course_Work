Seven of the 14 incontinent patients regained continence after surgery, and a further two patients improved. Improvement in internal and external sphincter function follows correction of rectal prolapse. Preoperative resting anal pressure was significantly higher in continent patients than in incontinent patients (P less than 0.05), as was the maximum voluntary contraction pressure (P less than 0.027). Postoperatively there was a significant increase in the resting anal pressure (P less than 0.0001) and maximum voluntary contraction pressure (P less than 0.003) in the whole group. The preoperative resting anorectal angle was significantly more acute (P less than 0.028) in continent patients than in incontinent patients. There was no significant change in the resting anorectal angle following prolapse repair. Patients who remained incontinent had a significantly lower preoperative resting anal pressure (P less than 0.01) than patients who improved or regained continence. Similarly, maximum voluntary contraction pressure was lower preoperatively in these patients (P less than 0.02). Preoperative resting anal pressure below 10 mm Hg and maximum voluntary contraction pressure below 50 mm Hg are associated with persisting incontinence after surgery.\r"

The antibody localized in 97.8 percent of primary tumours and in 88.8 percent of the principal tumor in second look procedures. Additional information concerning the extent of primary tumor was obtained in 11 of 43 patients (25.5 percent) undergoing excision of primary carcinoma and five of nine patients (55 percent) in the second look series. Incorrect information was obtained about the extent of the primary tumour in six patients (11.3 percent), whereas no incorrect information was obtained during second look procedures. RIGS correctly predicted the subsequent Dukes' staging in 77 percent of first look cases (sensitivity 65 percent, specificity 90 percent), although accurate identification of individual nodes was impossible. The technique influenced the surgical procedure performed in 2 of 43 cases (4.6 percent) in primary surgery and in three of nine patients undergoing second look laparotomy (33 percent). RIGS in primary colorectal carcinoma may provide additional information concerning extent of locally advanced tumors in particular and the principle that the subsequent surgery may be influenced has been established. The technique appears to have a greater role in second look procedures where it may help determine the extent of recurrent tumour. Larger follow-up series are required to define how the additional information provided by this technique may best be exploited.\r"

Two hundred consecutive patients undergoing low pelvic procedures with rectal resection and entry of the presacral space by a single surgeon, were randomized. In the irrigation group, two of four presacral sump drains were placed to low intermittent suction and the remaining sumps infused continuously with saline until the effluent was clear. In the drainage alone group, all four presacral sump drains were placed to suction. Drains were removed when drainage was less than 50 ml/24 hours. Perioperative antibiotics and bowel preparation were identical. Postoperative complications included pelvic abscess (n = 7), anastomotic leak/cuff sinus (n = 11), abdominal wound infection (n = 19), and perineal wound infection (n = 5). Postoperative irrigation of the pelvis did not result in a reduction in the overall rate of local pelvic septic complications. Positive intraoperative presacral cultures, the presence of anaerobes in the presacral space, and duration of pelvic drainage had no effect on the development of pelvic sepsis.\r"

We have investigated the pathophysiology of this entity in an animal model. After 5 days of bowel obstruction, blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery was measured with and without Pitressin and norepinephrine given in separate experiments. In controls, Pitressin in moderate dosages caused a substantial fall in gut blood flow, which was not seen in obstructed animals (blood flow reduction 52 percent vs. 11 percent in sham and obstructed animals respectively, P less than 0.01). Similarly, norepinephrine infusion had less of an effect on gut blood flow in obstructed animals (blood flow reduction 79 percent vs. 58 percent sham vs. obstructed animals (P less than 0.05). Thus, both agents had dose-related effects on gut blood flow, which was maintained at a higher level throughout the drug infusion periods in the bowel of obstructed animals, demonstrating that splanchnic flow is less responsive to vasoactive drug infusion under these experimental conditions. Because splanchnic vasoconstriction is an important feature of normal hemodynamic homeostasis, we suggest that these results may help explain some aspects of the pathophysiology of multiorgan failure caused or worsened by systemic hypotension seen in bowel obstruction.\r"

We studied the influence of four nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs on the healing of intestinal anastomoses in rats, with special regard to changes of collagen levels around the anastomoses. Four experimental groups of 20 rats each received daily oral doses of piroxicam, ibuprofen, aspirin, or indomethacin and were compared with a control group. Animals were sacrificed 3 or 7 days after operation. Both morbidity and mortality rate in the experimental groups were high. Collagen, measured as hydroxyproline, levels in anastomotic and adjoining 1-cm intestinal segments were compared with concentrations in control segments resected during operation. After an initial decrease on day 3, hydroxyproline concentrations increased on day 7. In the colon the lowering of hydroxyproline concentrations, which was more pronounced than in the ileum, was significantly reduced by administration of piroxicam and ibuprofen, both in the anastomosis and its proximal segment. On day 7, the increase of hydroxyproline concentrations in the ileum was inhibited by administration of anti-inflammatory drugs. It is concluded that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may limit postoperative degradation of collagen in colonic anastomoses, but at the same time may increase the rat's susceptibility to surgical infections.\r"

Each case was staged according to the Dukes' classification as well as graded histologically. For all patients in this series, the perimeter, area, and nuclear shape factor of 50 interphase nuclei were determined for each carcinoma. The information was obtained through the use of an image analysis system by tracing the nuclear profiles (magnification 1000x) as digitized on a video screen. The nuclear shape factor was defined as the degree of circularity of the nucleus, a perfect circle recorded as 1.0. A nuclear shape factor greater than 0.84 was associated with poor outcome. Multiple regression models showed that the single nuclear parameter of the shape factor was the most highly significant predictor of survival (P less than 0.0001). This variable remained highly significant even when corrected for sex, age, histologic grade, and Dukes' classification. These findings indicate that a nuclear shape factor greater than or equal to 0.84 as determined by nuclear morphometry is an independent morphometric nuclear variable of great importance in the prognosis of large bowel carcinoma.\r"

Twenty-two women were in their third trimester, 80 percent were multiparous, and each had a remote history of hemorrhoidal symptoms, including intermittent pain, bleeding, and protrusion. Closed hemorrhoidectomy was performed under local anesthesia. The surgery was directed at removing only symptomatic disease, which included three quadrants in 14 patients, two quadrants in seven patients, and one quadrant in four patients. All patients experienced relief of intractable pain the day after surgery, except one patient who required a hemostatic packing during the immediate post-operative period. There were no other maternal or fetal complications. Subsequent follow-up for anorectal disease ranged from 6 months to 6 years. Six (24 percent) patients required additional hemorrhoid treatment. Hemorrhoidectomy in selected pregnant patients is safe in our experience.\r"

A gradual development of severe atrophy in the ileal mucosa was followed by the development of low grade dysplasia. At the most recent endoscopic control, 4 years after the construction of the pouch, biopsies were sampled also for flow cytometric DNA analyses. DNA aneuploidy was detected in a biopsy from the center of the pouch, and a biopsy taken immediately adjacent showed low grade dysplasia. These findings underline the importance of endoscopic follow-up after construction of a pelvic pouch and focus attention to the potential of malignant transformation of the mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the glycan moiety of the rat ovarian LH/CG receptor and human CG (hCG) in high-affinity receptor-hormone interaction was investigated by cross-linking and quantitative binding experiments. hCG and its derivatives, desialylated hCG and deglycosylated hCG were labeled either to the alpha-subunit (125I) or the beta-subunit (3H). The ligands were attached to ovarian membrane particles, which were treated with neuraminidase or peptide-N-glycosidase F to remove terminal sialic acids or N-linked oligosaccharides of the receptor, respectively, and the complexes formed were solubilized, cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All of the ligands produced similar autoradiographic patterns with the native or glycosidase-treated receptor, and only the receptor-(alpha)hCG and receptor-(alpha, beta)hCG complexes were detected. Moreover, quantitative binding studies indicated that all of the hormone derivatives had similar affinities for the native or glycosidase-treated receptor. In addition, the orientation of the carbohydrate side chains on the receptor-hormone complex was studied by digesting the complex with the glycosidases. The molecular weight of the receptor, evidenced by ligand blotting, was reduced to the same extent, whether the membrane-bound free receptor or receptor-hormone complex was treated with the glycosidases, suggesting that the oligosaccharide side chains of the receptor are apart from the hormone binding region. As peptide-N-glycosidase F treatment reduced the size of the Mr 90,000 receptor first to about Mr 67,000 and finally to about Mr 62,000, there may possibly be 2 N-linked carbohydrate chains per receptor polypeptide. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the glycosidase-treated receptor-[125I]hCG complex also revealed that neuraminidase was able to remove the sialic acids from both subunits of the receptor-bound hormone. In conclusion, the results suggest that hCG interacts with the polypeptide backbone of its ovarian receptor mainly through the peptide core of its alpha-subunit. Moreover, the carbohydrate side chains of both subunits of hCG are positioned on the outward face of the receptor-hormone complex.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that male rats with experimental uremia manifest profound suppression of circulating LH and testosterone levels, yet, paradoxically, after castration gonadotropin levels are elevated greatly above those of nonuremic castrate control rats. To investigate further this phenomenon, we characterized pulsatile LH secretion in experimental uremia. Mature orchidectomized male Wistar rats with subtotal nephrectomy demonstrated a 43% reduction of LH pulse frequency, but a 157% increase in pulse amplitude and a 335% increase in mean LH levels compared with sham-operated controls. All pulse parameters were highly correlated with plasma creatinine (r = 0.53-0.75). To determine the mechanism of the increased pulse amplitude, we tested responsiveness of the postcastration uremic pituitary to exogenous GnRH (0.01-10 micrograms/kg) in a Latin square design. Plasma LH response was linearly related to the logarithm of the GnRH dose in uremic and control rats, but was markedly increased in uremic rats. We conclude that the uremia causes decreased LH pulse frequency independent of testicular feedback. Pituitary hypersensitivity to GnRH magnifies LH pulse amplitude and thereby is the major factor causing the paradoxical LH hyperelevation after castration.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) increased progesterone production in preovulatory rat follicles in vitro. More than 1 h in the presence of TNF was needed to enhance progesterone secretion, which was only seen after 24 h of culture. Neither cAMP nor cGMP levels in media and follicles increased either at short (5-20 min) or long periods (6-24 h) after TNF stimulation. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, H-7, blocked TNF-stimulated progesterone in a dose-dependent manner (1-300 mM), with 50% inhibition corresponding to 5.2 microM H-7, it also blocked LH-stimulated progesterone production, but higher doses were needed (50% inhibition corresponding to 54.5 microM H-7). However, the cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, HA1004, did not block TNF stimulated progesterone. The PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), increased progesterone maximally at 32 nM and above. Low doses of PMA in combination with TNF increased progesterone levels above that stimulated by PMA alone; however with the highest does of PMA (320 nM), TNF was unable to increase follicular progesterone secretion. The time course of progesterone stimulation by PMA was similar to that of TNF. H-7 also blocked PMA and PMA + TNF stimulated progesterone accumulation, with a 50% inhibition corresponding to 4.2 and 4.1 microM H-7, respectively. These results indicate that PKC may be a mediator of TNF-stimulated progesterone secretion in preovulatory rat follicles.\r"

  ".U": "91153206\r", 
  ".W": "Purified native forms of human parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrp) have recently been reported to display biological activities characteristic of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). The TGF-beta-like property of PTHrp may reside within the amino N-terminal PTH-receptor binding region of the polypeptide, since a synthetic analog corresponding to amino acids 1-36 of human PTHrp is as active as purified native PTHrp in bioassays specific to TGF-beta. Complete lack of structural similarity between PTHrp and TGF-beta prompted us to address the question whether copresence of the TGF-beta-like and PTH-like biological activities in the N-terminal sequence of the PTHrp molecule is a general phenomenon observable with different N-terminal PTHrp peptides of varying amino acid chain length in a variety of target cells that respond in defined ways to TGF-beta in vitro. Two forms of synthetic N-terminal human PTHrp, PTHrp-(1-34) and [Tyr40]PTHrp-(1-40), which are fully active in conventional assays for PTH/PTHrp, were tested for effects in three in vitro bioassay systems for TGF-beta: 1) stimulation, and 2) inhibition, respectively, of epidermal growth factor-dependent soft-agar colony formation of either normal rat kidney-derived fibroblasts (NRK 49F) or human lung carcinoma cells (A549); and 3) biosynthesis of metabolically labeled fibronectin in both NRK 49F cells and clonal osteoblastic rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8). Human TGF-beta over the dose range of 2.5-80 pM significantly stimulated or inhibited soft-agar colony formation of either NRK 49F or A549 cells, respectively, and caused a severalfold increase in biosynthetically labeled [35S]fibronectin in NRK 49F and ROS 17/2.8 cells. In contrast, none of PTHrp-(1-34), [Tyr40]PTHrp-(1-40), and synthetic human PTH-(1-34), each tested at 0.1-10 nM, displayed detectable biological activity in any of the three assay systems. In addition, covalent cross-linking of intact NRK 49F and ROS 17/2.8 cells with either [125I]TGF-beta or 125I-[Tyr40] PTHrp-(1-40) revealed the presence of several distinct affinity-labeled receptor species for TGF-beta in both cell types and the 80K PTH/PTHrp receptors in ROS 17/2.8 cells. The affinity-labeled TGF-beta receptor species were insensitive to excess PTHrp and PTH peptides, and the 80K PTH/PTHrp receptors were insensitive to excess TGF-beta, indicating that PTHrp and TGF-beta do not cross-react with respect to receptor binding for interaction with these cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The mice belonged to three different pedigrees and were killed between 14 and 63 weeks of age. The levels of GH receptor (GH-R) and PRL receptor (PRL-R) determined by competitive binding assays were similar to those observed in late pregnant, nontransgenic mice. This observation was made for all transgenic mice expressing elevated serum oGH levels, irrespective of sex, final size, or age. Cross-linking studies revealed that binding occurred predominantly to a Mr 48,000 polypeptide with a small amount of binding to polypeptides of Mr 60,000, 70,000, and 100,000 in transgenic mice as well as in a late pregnant, nontransgenic mouse. Total cellular RNA was isolated from livers of transgenic and nontransgenic mice and analyzed on Northern blots using probes specific for GH-R and PRL-R. Results showed that the levels of messenger RNA for both GH-R and PRL-R were elevated in transgenic mice expressing high levels of serum oGH. Since levels of PRL in these mice were within the normal range, these results demonstrate that oGH is capable of inducing hepatic GH-R and PRL-R in vivo and that PRL is not required for the induction of its own receptor. These data also demonstrate, for the first time, the suitability of transgenic mice expressing a foreign GH for the study of the regulation of hepatic GH and PRL receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of androgens to the regulation of aromatase activity (AA), measured by quantifying the in vitro formation of [3H]estrone from 19-[3H]hydroxyandrostenedione precursor, was studied in equivalent microdissected brain regions of adult and fetal ferrets. In adulthood, AA was similar in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial (M) and lateral (L) preoptic area (POA), medial (MA) and lateral amygdala (LA), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), and parietal cortex of gonadectomized males and females given no concurrent steroid treatment. Daily sc injections of the androgen dihydrotestosterone propionate significantly stimulated AA in MPOA, MA, and VMH of adult males and in MA of females; a similar trend was seen in MPOA and VMH of females. By contrast, no evidence of androgenic regulation of AA was obtained in these three brain regions microdissected from fetuses killed on embryonic day 35 (E35; 41-day gestation). Transplacental administration of the antiandrogen flutamide beginning on day E24 failed to affect AA in MPOA, LPOA, MA, LA, or parietal cortex, although this treatment significantly reduced AA in bed nucleus of the stria terminalis of fetal males. The results suggest that the responsiveness of aromatizing enzymes to androgenic induction is similar in several subcortical brain regions of adult ferrets of both sexes. In breeding males such an action of androgen may augment the neural production of estrogen, which has previously been implicated in the control of sexual behavior and the feedback regulation of LH secretion. By contrast, androgen apparently contributes minimally to the regulation of AA in brain regions of fetal ferrets, particularly in the MPOA, in which a sexually dimorphic nucleus differentiates in males around E37 in response to estrogen produced locally.\r"

This biologically inactive material complicates immunological measurement of hCG, since it cross-reacts with many polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the hCG beta-subunit that are employed for assays of hCG in urine. Although we and others have developed antibodies to this fragment, specific measurement of the fragment in the presence of free hCG beta has remained difficult due to intrinsic cross-reactivity of these antibodies with the intact hCG beta. Rather than attempt to increase specificity by assay optimization, we developed a new, highly specific monoclonal antibody, designated B210, which cross-reacts less than 0.1% with the free hCG beta-subunit in both liquid and solid phase immunoassay formats. We have used this new monoclonal antibody in immunoradiometric assays to measure specifically the hCG beta fragment in urine throughout pregnancy as well as in the sera of two individuals with cancers producing the hCG beta-subunit. We discovered that the hCG beta fragment can bind three monoclonal antibodies simultaneously, indicating that although the epitope for antibody B210 is a new determinant exposed on the hCG beta fragment and not on intact hCG or on free hCG beta-subunit, the hCG beta fragment retains at least two other hCG beta-related epitopes intact, i.e. those that bind monoclonal antibodies B108 and B201.\r"

  ".W": "GnRH synthesis and release are regulated by a number of neurotransmitter systems. Several studies have implicated the opioidergic system as one of the important modulators of GnRH. To obtain an index of the activity of beta-endorphin-secreting neurons during the estrous cycle, we measured levels of proopiomelanocortin mRNA (POMC mRNA) in the periarcuate region at different cycle stages, using in situ hybridization. Ten female Sprague-Dawley rats (200-230 g) were killed at each of 11 times during the 4-day estrous cycle. Fresh frozen sections were made through the rostral arcuate nucleus and placed on gelatin-coated slides. A 48-base probe complementary to rat POMC mRNA was 3' end-labeled with [35S]dATP and applied to individual sections in hybridization buffer. Sections were washed and exposed to film. Relative amounts of POMC mRNA were measured by obtaining optical densities with an image analyzer. POMC mRNA levels varied significantly. At proestrus, they were low just before the onset of the LH surge, followed by a sharp rise that afternoon. On the day of estrus, POMC mRNA remained elevated and then declined again on metestrus. A second but smaller rise was seen in the late afternoon of metestrus. This pattern of changes in POMC mRNA is consistent with an inhibitory effect of beta-endorphin on GnRH after the midcycle surge and in the postovulatory phase of the cycle, while low levels of POMC mRNA in the early afternoon of proestrus may permit the release of GnRH, which triggers the LH surge. The changes in POMC mRNA approximately parallel changes in progesterone in the cycle.\r"

  ".U": "91153211\r", 
  ".W": "The familial hypophosphatemic (vitamin D-resistant) disorders are a variety of genetic and acquired syndromes that exhibit unexpected biochemical heterogeneity, manifest as variably abnormal or apparently normal regulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] production. Recently, we observed that Hyp and Gy mice, murine homologs of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, exhibit similarly disparate regulation of vitamin D metabolism. While Gy mice under basal conditions maintain an appropriate elevation (relative to hypophosphatemia) of renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD)-1 alpha-hydroxylase, Hyp mice manifest only normal, not increased, enzyme activity. Whether such diversity results from maintenance of phosphate (P)-regulated 1,25-(OH)2D production in Gy mice and loss of this function in Hyp mice or from other variations remains unknown. Therefore, we examined the integrity of P-regulated enzyme activity in the Gy and Hyp mice by testing the effects of enzyme inhibition and alteration of the serum phosphorus concentration on 1,25-(OH)2D production. Initially, we discovered that inhibition of renal 25OHD-1 alpha-hydroxylase suppressed enzyme function in Hyp mice, but did not prevent expression of P-mediated activity in Gy mice. In this regard, while administration of a high calcium diet or 1,25-(OH)2D (0.4 ng/h, sc, for 48 h) resulted in a comparable inhibition of enzyme activity in Hyp (5.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.7 fmol/mg.min) and normal mice (4.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.2 fmol/mg.min), similar treatment did not effect complete inhibition of 25OHD-1 alpha-hydroxylase in Gy (10.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 4.9 +/- 0.3 fmol/mg.min) or P-depleted mice (10.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.4 fmol/mg.min). In accord with the apparent persistence of P-mediated stimulation of enzyme function in Gy mice, dietary P repletion in this mutant resulted in a serum phosphorus concentration similar to that of normal mice and decreased enzyme activity (4.0 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg.min) to a level no different from that expressed in controls (3.4 +/- 0.3 fmol/mg.min). However, in the absence of apparent P-mediated stimulation of enzyme activity, identical treatment of Hyp mice increased the serum phosphorus level comparably, but paradoxically enhanced 25OHD-1 alpha-hydroxylase (3.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 11.7 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg.min). Collectively, these data indicate that enhanced renal 25OHD-1 alpha-hydroxylase expressed in Gy mice and probably in related human diseases results from normally maintained P regulation of enzyme activity, an action absent or mutated in the genetically distinct Hyp mouse.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether dietary sodium intake modifies the generation of adrenal-produced angiotensins and/or their relative proportions, Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on a low (0.02%), normal (0.4%), or high (1.5%) sodium intake for 5 days. The animals were then killed by decapitation at 0900 h, and their adrenal glands were removed and dissected into two parts: capsular tissue, containing the zona glomerulosa (ZG), and the decapsulated adrenal gland. The tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and extracted, and the individual angiotensins [angiotensin-II (AII), angiotensin-III (AIII), angiotensin-I (AI), and Des-Asp-angiotensin-I (Des-Asp-AI)] were separated by HPLC and quantitated by RIA. On a normal sodium intake, the molar contents of the four angiotensins were similar in ZG, ranging from 3.1-6.6 pmol/g, although AII was present in a 60-70% higher concentration than AIII. In the decapsulated adrenal, the concentrations of the various angiotensins were again similar, but the absolute levels (per g tissue) were significantly (P less than 0.02) less than those in the ZG layer. With sodium restriction, the AII content increased more than 2-fold in the ZG, but not in the decapsulated adrenal tissue. In contrast, both AI and Des-Asp-AI significantly (P less than 0.01) decreased with sodium restriction, so that their contents on the low salt diet were only 15-20% of those observed on the high sodium diet. Thus, there was an inverse correlation (P less than 0.001) between the salt content of rat chow and the AII content of the ZG. The correlation between salt intake and AI as well as Des-Asp-AI levels was direct and significant (P less than 0.02). The AIII level in the ZG was similar on all diets. After a lag period, ZG AII increased sharply between 16-48 h of sodium restriction. These data document that sodium intake has a profound effect on the angiotensin content of the ZG, with sodium restriction substantially increasing the levels of AII while reducing the level of its substrate, AI. This also appears to be unique for glomerulosa cells, as in the decapsulated adrenal gland there is little if any change with sodium restriction. We conclude that these sodium-mediated changes in tissue AII production may be involved in the increased responsiveness of glomerulosa cells to aldosterone secretagogues during sodium restriction.\r"

Ovariectomy on day 80 or 100 followed by progesterone replacement therapy resulted in a dramatic reduction in the rate of growth of mammary parenchymal cross-section area on days 100 and 110 of gestation, respectively, compared to that in controls. In contrast, progesterone plus relaxin therapy, with highly purified porcine relaxin, restored the mammary parenchymal cross-section area to control values in ovariectomized gilts. Morphometric analysis of mammary tissue on day 110 of pregnancy indicated that both the absence of relaxin after ovariectomy and replacement therapy with porcine relaxin in ovariectomized gilts had little if any effect on the percentages of the lumen, stroma, or epithelial that comprised the mammary parenchyma. It is concluded that relaxin has a stimulatory effect on the growth of mammary parenchymal tissue during late gestation in the pig.\r"

  ".W": "The seasonal changes in response to the negative feedback action of estradiol on LH secretion were studied in two groups of ovariectomized Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata fuscata; n = 6). Blood samples were collected two to three times a week, and changes in serum concentrations of LH, estradiol, and progesterone were examined. Before ovariectomy (OVX), serum LH was maintained at about 320 pg/ml regardless of the season (breeding season: autumn and winter). After OVX and simultaneous treatment sc with a Silastic implant of estradiol during the first breeding season, serum LH increased rapidly and remained high. As spring arrived, serum LH decreased abruptly and remained low. The removal of implants during the subsequent nonbreeding season resulted in an increase in serum LH similar to that during the previous breeding season after OVX and estradiol treatment. After the reinsertion of implants during the same nonbreeding season, serum LH reverted to previous low levels. As autumn arrived (second breeding season), serum LH rose again and remained high under the presence of implants. In the first subset of animals (n = 3), the implants were left in place until the subsequent mid-nonbreeding season when they were removed, and reinserted during the same non-breeding season. The findings closely corresponded to the previous results. In these animals, the implants were removed during the third breeding season, which resulted in a significant increase in serum LH. The second subset of animals (n = 3) underwent removal of implants during the second breeding season, which resulted in a further increase in serum LH, but the difference was not significant. In both subsets of animals, the timing of the increase and decrease in serum LH under the presence of implants virtually coincided with the onset and end of the breeding season in ovary-intact animals. Serum estradiol after OVX was maintained at levels similar to those in intact animals (80-100 pg/ml) under the presence of implants, but removal of implants resulted in decrease in serum estradiol to around 30 pg/ml within 1 week. Serum progesterone after OVX was maintained at low levels (less than 0.2 ng/ml) regardless of the presence of estradiol implants. These results clearly indicate a marked seasonal difference in serum LH concentrations in ovariectomized monkeys in response to constant serum estradiol. It is suggested that seasonal breeding of the Japanese monkey is governed by biannual changes in the response of the hypothalamo-hypophysial axis to the negative feedback action of estradiol.\r"

The secreted hGH-V protein differs from pituitary GH (hGH-N) by only 13 amino acids. We have previously demonstrated that hGH-V can bind to both somatogen and lactogen cell surface receptors in vitro, but that the ratio of its somatogen to lactogen receptor-binding affinities is substantially higher than that of hGH-N. We now characterize the somatogen and lactogen bioactivities of hGH-V and contrast them to the bioactivity of hGH-N. Somatogen bioactivity was assayed by stimulation of weight gain in hypophysectomized rats, and lactogen bioactivity was assayed by the mitogenic response of the Nb2 lymphoma cell line. While the average increase in rat body weight in response to a fixed concentration of hormone was comparable using either hGH-V or hGH-N, the mitotic response of the lactogen-inducible Nb2 cells was significantly less for hGH-V. The comparable somatogen, but lower lactogen, bioactivity of hGH-V relative to hGH-N parallels the previously reported receptor binding profiles of the two hormones and suggests that hGH-V has the potential to perform a unique role during human gestation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of cerebroventricular anterior pituitary (AP) grafts on brain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the median eminence (ME), substantia nigra (SN), and corpus striatum (CS) has been investigated in young and aged female rats. TH expression was studied using the following indices: in situ TH activity, TH mass, and quantity of TH mRNA. The rate of synthesis of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) was evaluated by measuring its accumulation in the ME, SN, and CS. TH mRNA and TH mass were quantified by an S1 nuclease protection assay and an immunoblot assay, respectively. Viability of the grafts was demonstrated by histological examination and by their ability to secrete PRL into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Liver grafts served as controls. In castrated young and castrated aged animals with AP grafts, the PRL concentrations in the CSF were 204 +/- 49 (mean +/- SE) and 345 +/- 83 ng/ml, respectively, compared to control values of 14 +/- 9 and 23 +/- 9. In intact aged animals, the concentration of PRL was 729 +/- 180 ng/ml in CSF of rats with AP grafts and 223 +/- 62 ng/ml in the controls. DOPA synthesis in the ME of castrated young rats and castrated aged rats with AP grafts was significantly (P less than 0.01) greater than that in controls with liver grafts. AP grafts did not stimulate DOPA synthesis in the ME of intact aged animals. The synthesis of DOPA in the SN and CS was not affected by AP grafts, regardless of the status of the animal. The amount of TH mRNA and the quantity of TH were not influenced by the AP grafts in any of the animal models. However, the in situ molar activity of TH in the ME was significantly greater in castrated young rats and castrated aged rats bearing AP grafts than in animals with liver grafts. The in situ molar activity of TH in the ME of castrated young rats was greater than that of castrated or intact aged animals. It is concluded that AP grafts secrete a substance that stimulates DOPA synthesis in the ME of young as well as aged castrated animals, but not in the nigrostriatal system. This stimulation is due to increased catalytic activity of a fixed number of TH molecules rather than an increase in the mass of TH.\r"

  ".W": "Males are generally more responsive than females to the behavioral and neuroendocrine actions of androgens. The present experiments were performed to determine whether these differences may result from sex differences in the number of androgen receptors (AR) in specific brain areas. For this reason, AR binding was compared in both cytosol (ARc) and cell nuclear KCl extracts (ARn) from microdissected brain regions of gonadectomized male and female rats treated with doses of testosterone (T) that produced equivalent physiological circulating androgen levels. In addition, microsomal aromatase activity was measured as a biochemical index of tissue responsiveness to T, since estrogen formation in certain brain areas is regulated by androgen. One week after exogenous T administration, males exhibited significantly higher levels of ARn than females in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periventricular preoptic area, and ventromedial nucleus. Males also had significantly higher aromatase levels in these same areas plus the medial preoptic nucleus and anterior hypothalamus. There were no significant differences in ARn concentrations in eight other nuclei that were examined for significant sex differences in ARc levels observed under these experimental conditions. When ARc levels were compared in untreated gonadectomized male and female rats, males had greater levels of ARc in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis only, indicating that new receptor synthesis may be responsible for the sex differences observed in T-treated rats. These results suggest that sex differences in neural responsiveness to androgens may be due in part to sex differences in ARn occupation in specific brain regions.\r"

We examined the effects of physiological plasma OT levels on renal sodium excretion by infusing graded doses of OT sc in conscious adult male rats maintained on a sodium-deficient diet. Our results demonstrate that OT causes a dose-related increase in urinary sodium excretion during the initial day of infusion. The lowest plasma OT levels associated with increases in urinary sodium excretion (5-6 pmol/liter) were well within the range of physiological OT secretion in rats. However, this natriuretic effect was not sustained during subsequent days of maintenance on a sodium-deficient diet, suggesting that the OT-induced natriuresis was limited in part by receptor desensitization and/or a decreased exchangeable sodium pool in combination with secretion of opposing antinatriuretic factors such as aldosterone. Pretreatment with an OT receptor antagonist completely blocked the natriuresis produced by a 20 pmol/h infusion of OT, but urinary sodium excretion was not affected by a vasopressin V1 antagonist and was blocked only partially by a combined vasopressin V1 and V2 antagonist. Together with previous studies in rats demonstrating an inverse relation between pituitary OT secretion and sodium appetite, these results support the hypothesis that peripherally and centrally secreted OT act in concert in rats to produce a negative sodium balance by stimulating sodium excretion while inhibiting sodium ingestion.\r"

IGF-I mRNA was first detectable in whole embryos on day 6, while serum IGF-I could be measured on day 9, the earliest time point examined. Serum IGF-I values rose 10-fold from about 3 ng/ml on day 10 to a prehatch peak of 30-35 ng/ml during days 15-17, and then declined to about 10 ng/ml at the time of hatching. On days 17 and 20 of incubation, IGF-I mRNA was detected in eye, skeletal muscle, and brain, but could not be found in liver or heart until after hatching. During the posthatch period, serum IGF-I rose from 10 ng/ml in the first week to 35-40 ng/ml during weeks 3-6, and liver IGF-I mRNA increased nearly 5-fold from weeks 1-7. The increases observed during weeks 1-3 correlated with a posthatch rise in serum GH from 21 to 37 ng/ml, although GH levels declined over the subsequent 4 weeks without an appreciable change in serum IGF-I values. By contrast, before embryonic day 12 no GH could be detected in the circulation, while IGF-I was 19 ng/ml on day 11. These observations suggest that there is both GH-dependent and GH-independent regulation of IGF-I gene expression in the chick, as has been found in mammals, and support the idea that IGF-I plays a role in chicken embryonic development.\r"

Administration of shock to intact rats resulted in a 74% decrement in T-lymphocyte proliferation and a 59% decrease in natural killer cytotoxicity. Similar suppression of these two parameters of immune function in response to shock was noted in adrenalectomized rats as well. The immunosuppressive effects of this shock were significantly and comparably blunted when both intact and adrenalectomized animals were pretreated 1) iv with either a highly potent polyclonal CRF antibody or a specific CRF antagonist or 2) intracerebroventricularly with either a high affinity monoclonal antibody to CRF or a specific CRF antagonist. An immunomodulatory role for CRF is further supported by the findings that administration of exogenous CRF, either iv (10 micrograms/animal) or intracerebroventricularly (1 microgram/animal), resulted in significant decrements in lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer cytotoxicity, similar to those seen with the stress paradigm. Our observations indicate that CRF plays a significant role in modulating the immune response to subacute stress, largely by adrenal-independent mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "91153221\r", 
  ".W": "Seasonal reproductive transitions in ewes are generated endogenously and are synchronized by annual changes in photoperiod. Previous evidence indicates that thyroidectomy prevents the transition to anestrus in ewes maintained in a fixed day length, suggesting that the thyroid is needed for endogenously generated reproductive arrest. Here we tested the hypothesis that the thyroid is required for endogenous seasonal suppression of the neuroendocrine mechanism that regulates pulsatile LH secretion. Ewes were thyroidectomized (n = 6) in summer, 6 weeks before the onset of the breeding season, or they remained thyroid intact (n = 6). They were housed in a simulated natural photoperiod until the winter solstice; thereafter, they remained on that photoperiod (10 h of light, 14 h of darkness). To monitor pulsatile LH secretion, the ewes were ovariectomized and implanted with estradiol, and LH was measured in both frequent (every 6 min for 4 h) and infrequent (twice weekly) blood samples. In this model, high LH indicates low response to estradiol negative feedback and reproductive induction; low LH signifies high response to estradiol negative feedback and reproductive arrest. LH levels (samples twice weekly) rose some 50-fold in both groups concurrently at the start of the breeding season in September. Frequent sampling in midbreeding season (autumn) revealed that both thyroidectomized and thyroid-intact ewes exhibited frequent LH pulses, with no group difference, in either the presence or absence of the estradiol implant. A marked group difference, however, emerged at the end of the breeding season. LH fell to basal values in thyroid-intact ewes (onset of low values Feb 3 +/- 8 days), whereas levels remained elevated in thyroidectomized ewes through the end of the study (April 26). At this time, thyroidectomized ewes had more frequent LH pulses than thyroid-intact ewes both in the presence and absence of estradiol. The circadian pattern of melatonin secretion and the seasonal change in PRL were found to be unaffected by thyroidectomy. These observations support the hypothesis that the thyroid is necessary for endogenous suppression of neuroendocrine mechanisms that generate LH pulses, a suppression crucial for the transition to anestrus.\r"

  ".W": "Chromogranin A (CgA) is a 50 kilodalton (kDa) acidic glycoprotein that is costored and cosecreted from secretory granules with endogenous hormone from diverse endocrine cell types. The physiological role(s) of CgA is yet to be defined. In this study we used the AtT-20 mouse corticotropic cell line, which produces both CgA and POMC-derived peptides, to study 1) the regulation of CgA and POMC synthesis and secretion, and 2) the influence of CgA on POMC secretion. To study regulation of CgA and POMC biosynthesis and secretion, cells were treated with dexamethasone (DEX) or CRF for 48 h and CgA and POMC messenger RNAs and proteins were analyzed. Exposure to DEX for 48 h (10 nM) inhibited secretion of the 16 K fragment of POMC by 60% while stimulating CgA secretion 500% of control value. Consonant with these changes in protein, POMC mRNA levels fell to 40% of control levels while CgA mRNA levels increased to 250% of control values with DEX treatment. DEX treatment had no effect on the sizes of the CgA [2.1 kilobase (kb)] and POMC (1.0 kb) mRNAs. CRF (100 nM) stimulated secretion of both CgA (4-fold) and ACTH (2.5-fold) above basal values. By contrast, CRF increased POMC mRNA levels but had no effect on levels of CgA mRNA. Changes in total peptide production paralleled the changes in mRNA levels. Because DEX differentially regulated CgA and POMC synthesis and secretion, we questioned whether CgA could function as an autocrine inhibitor of hormone secretion. CgA inhibited CRF-stimulated secretion of 16 K fragment in a concentration-dependent manner (100% at 100 nM) without affecting basal 16 K fragment secretion. Moreover, anti-CgA antiserum, but not nonimmune serum, increased basal 16 K fragment secretion 2-fold and CRF-stimulated 16 K fragment secretion 1.5-fold. These results suggest that CgA plays an autocrine role as a glucocorticoid responsive inhibitor of POMC-derived peptide secretion.\r"

Several in vitro studies indicate the hormone to have a direct effect on immune cells, and other studies show that estrogen may affect humoral immunity indirectly through the thymus. Therefore, we have conducted experiments to investigate the requirement of the thymus in the enhancement of humoral immune responsiveness by estrogen. In Exp I, adult ovariectomized Lewis rats were thymectomized or sham thymectomized and given estradiol (E2; 0.25 microgram E2 in sesame oil, sc, once every 4 days) or the oil vehicle in a 2 x 2 factorial design, and their antifluorescein responses were followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay across 21 days. Only animals that were thymus intact and given estrogen replacement showed significantly (P less than 0.05) greater serum antifluorescein titers than all other treatments. In Exp II, ovariectomized thymectomized rats were submitted to a 2 x 3 factorial design of oil vehicle or E2 replacement and saline, gelatin, or thymus replacement (thymosin fraction 5; 1 mg/kg in saline, sc). As described above, only the animals receiving both thymosin fraction 5 and E2 replacement displayed antifluorescein titers that were significantly (P less than 0.03) increased over titers of all other treatment groups. These results indicate that the enhancement of in vivo humoral immunity by estrogen requires the thymus, and that a constitutive thymic factor, found in thymosin fraction 5, exerts a permissive influence on the action of E2 outside the thymus to increase a specific humoral immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple signal transduction pathways interact in FRTL5 cells to promote thyroid follicular cell differentiated function and cell proliferation. In these cells, TSH is a tissue-specific mitogen that promotes DNA synthesis primarily through activation of adenylate cyclase. To further test the role of adenylate cyclase in regulating cell growth and differentiated function we have introduced into FRTL5 the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor (BAR) complementary DNA and have studied the ability of isoproterenol, alone and in combination with insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), to stimulate cAMP accumulation, iodide transport, [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, and cell growth. Wild-type FRTL5 were infected with a PLJ retroviral construct containing the BAR in either a sense (FRTL BAR) or antisense (FRTL RBAR) orientation, and cell populations were selected on the basis of resistance to the antibiotic geneticin. FRTL BAR expressed approximately 1.3 x 10(5) high affinity binding sites per cell for the beta 2-specific ligand, CGP-12177, while neither FRTL5 wild-type nor RBAR cells demonstrated any specific binding. FRTL BAR had significantly higher levels of intracellular cAMP, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and iodide uptake in the absence of added isoproterenol than FRTL RBAR or wild-type cells. In FRTL BAR, but not RBAR cells, isoproterenol stimulated a dose-dependent accumulation of cAMP, iodide uptake, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and cell growth. FRTL BAR and RBAR cells were equally responsive to TSH and to IGF-I. Isoproterenol enhanced the ability of IGF-I to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation in BAR but not RBAR cells. Isoproterenol partially inhibited the ability of TSH to stimulate cAMP generation and DNA synthesis. These studies demonstrate that activation of adenylate cyclase through the BAR introduced into FRTL5 cells by retroviral infection reproduces the range of biological effects in these cells stimulated by TSH and suggest that activation of adenylate cyclase is sufficient to stimulate thyroid differentiated function and cell growth. FRTL BAR cells will provide an interesting model system with which to study the heterologous regulation of both TSH and BARs through activation of a common signal transduction pathway, adenylate cyclase.\r"

This elevation was independent of changes in PTH, ionized calcium, or phosphate. This paper investigates the potential sources and mechanisms for this increase in both rats and mice. Kidney homogenates from rats treated for 14 days with (15 mg/kg) had a significant increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD)-24-hydroxylase (24-hydroxylase) activity (149 +/- 20 vs. 89 +/- 16 fmol/mg.min; P less than 0.05), but nonsignificant increases in 25OHD-1 alpha-hydroxylase (1 alpha-hydroxylase) activity compared to controls. Kidney homogenates from C57b16J mice after the administration of 30-50 mg/kg CsA for 3 days revealed a linear dose-related increase in renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase (r = 0.96; P less than 0.05), which became significant with doses of 30 mg/kg CsA or more (P less than 0.05). To investigate the source of this 1,25-(OH)2D production, serum 1,25-(OH)2D was measured before and 48 h after bilateral nephrectomy in rats receiving CsA for 16 days. The percent decrease in serum 1,25-(OH)2D values was not significantly different in CsA-treated and untreated rats (33.9 +/- 4.9% vs. 47.5 +/- 4.9%), indicating little or no contribution from nonrenal sources. Studies of MCRs and production rates (PRs) revealed that the elevated 1,25-(OH)2D values were due to enhanced production and not altered clearance (PR, 12.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 19.1 +/- 1.9 fmol/mg.min; P less than 0.01). CsA increases 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity and produces significant elevations in serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels in both rats and mice. This increase may have an impact on bone mineral metabolism and immune modulation in postorgan transplantation patients.\r"

  ".W": "Secretogranin II (SgII) is a protein of pituitary secretory granules released by LHRH-stimulated gonadotrope cells. Estrogens and androgens are modulators of SgII release. Experiments were performed to determine the regulation of expression of the SgII gene in the female rat pituitary, during sexual maturation and according to the estrous cycle. Age- and cycle-related changes in SgII mRNA content were estimated through cytoplasmic slot blot; SgII content was determined by western blotting; maturation of the protein was controlled through [35S]sulfate labeling. Variations in chromogranin A (CgA), another protein of secretory granules, were analyzed in the same experimental conditions to assess the specificity of SgII regulation. The pituitary SgII concentration increased between days 7 and 21 (2.2-fold) and then declined to the initial 7-day-old value. Simultaneously, the CgA concentration went through a maximum between days 14 and 21 and then strongly dropped to barely detectable levels in the adult pituitary. The SgII mRNA concentration followed roughly the same pattern as the protein. Moreover, the sulfation level remained constant between days 14 and 60. These results demonstrated a regulatory mechanism operating, during sexual maturation, on the SgII gene and not on the protein processing or on storage/release steps. In the 4-day cycling females, the pituitary SgII mRNA and protein contents were the lowest during estrus. They then increased to their highest values in diestrus II. Moreover, the sulfation level of SgII was significantly higher during estrus than during any other stage. Due to its low content level, variations in pituitary CgA could not be demonstrated during the cycle.\r"

The Km (concentration giving half-maximal activity) for Ca2+ was 60 nM. In the presence of 0.4 microM free Ca2+, the Km for ATP was 15 microM, and the Km for Mg2+ was 4 microM. Glucose (30 mM) decreased Ca2+ uptake by 50%, while other insulin secretagogues had no effect, except for glyceraldehyde, which stimulated Ca2+ uptake. Calmodulin increased the uptake of Ca2+, while trifluoperazine and vanadate inhibited the uptake. The Ca2(+)- and Mg2(+)-dependent ATPase from this tumor has a 10- to 20-fold higher requirement for Ca2+, which suggests that this enzyme is not responsible for Ca2+ transport, rather, Ca2+ transport activity represents only a small fraction of the total Ca2(+)-ATPase activity. The physiological importance of Ca2+ transport in insulin secretion is evident from the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by glucose, which leads to a decrease in Ca2+ efflux from the cell. This inhibition would lead to an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ and insulin release.\r"

  ".W": "The responsiveness of the neonatal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to stress has been thought to be impaired or diminished during the first 2 weeks of life. Although we previously found full responsiveness of the hypothalamus-pituitary unit to adrenalectomy in young rats [days (d) 5-10], we failed to measure a significant increase in ACTH 10 min after ether administration until d14 of age. These studies were, therefore, designed to test the functional activation of the HPA axis after a single or repeated exposures to stress. Both qualitative (time-course, stressor-specific, circadian) and quantitative changes in the ACTH and corticosterone (B) responses to various stressors were tested during the first 10 days of life. Exposure to 3 min of ether vapor increased ACTH and B secretion (P less than 0.05-0.01) in 1-, 5-, and 10-d-old rats, with an increasing amplitude of both ACTH and B responses as a function of age. Peak secretion of ACTH occurred 5 min after the onset of stress (122 +/- 3.8 to 359 +/- 54 pg/ml on d1-10), while the time of maximal B increased as a function of age. Other stressors, such as maternal separation (12 h), cold (4 C; 60 min), or histamine injection (4 mg/kg BW, ip), provoked significant and stressor-specific ACTH and B responses in 10-d old rats. Histamine administration increased ACTH secretion above that of vehicle-injected rats, with a peak of secretion 15 min after drug injection (272 +/- 29 vs. 127 +/- 8 pg/ml; P less than 0.01). Histamine-induced B secretion peaked at 60 min (3.7 +/- 0.5 micrograms/dl). In contrast to early responses observed after ether, separation, or histamine stress, cold stress in 10-d-old pups caused a large ACTH and B release 4 h after the onset of cold compared to that in maternally deprived pups [ACTH: cold, 457 +/- 61 pg/ml; separated, 150 +/- 14 (P less than 0.01); B: cold, 3.3 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl; separated, 1.8 +/- 0.2 (P less than 0.05)]. We did not detect morning-evening (AM-PM) differences in either the pattern or the magnitude of the ACTH or B response to maternal separation or cold stress. Suppression of cold-induced ACTH release by B injection (1 mg/kg BW) 2 h before stress was observed until 4 h after stress in the AM and PM, whereas when given after cold, B was less effective in the PM than in the AM at preventing the rise in ACTH levels observed at 4 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Immunoreactive epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been detected in the thyroid, which raises questions concerning the source of thyroidal EGF and what affects its levels. We therefore have examined the effects of manipulating thyroid function on the immunoreactive EGF levels in plasma, thyroid, submaxillary gland (SMG), and kidney of adult male BALB/c mice, and we also analyzed the prepro-EGF messenger RNA in these tissues. Groups of six mice received daily injection of T4 (1 microgram, 5 micrograms, or 25 micrograms) or bovine TSH (1 mU) for up to 14 days. The plasma EGF concentration was 0.31 +/- 0.01 ng/ml in control animals, and T4 (5 micrograms) decreased the plasma levels by about one-half within 1 week. The thyroidal EGF was 0.50 +/- 0.14 ng/mg protein in control animals, and T4 (5 micrograms) increased the thyroidal EGF 8-fold within 1 week. There was a negative correlation between plasma and thyroidal EGF concentration (r = -0.93, P less than 0.01). Increasing doses of T4 also increased the SMG EGF content, while plasma levels fell (r = -0.88, P less than 0.01). The TSH treatment did not significantly alter the plasma or tissue EGF levels. Studies on mRNA prepared from these three tissues, using the reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction, indicated that the prepro-EGF mRNA was present in thyroid, SMG, and kidney. In conclusion, it appears that at least some thyroidal EGF is synthesized in the thyroid. Our observations that T4 increases the level of intrathyroidal EGF in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, while plasma levels fall, suggest the possibility that intrathyroidal EGF represents a shortloop feedback for the autocrine and/or paracrine regulation of thyroid function.\r"

  ".U": "91153230\r", 
  ".W": "Recently, we have provided evidence that suggests that ethanol (ETOH) acts at the hypothalamic level to cause depressed serum LH levels and delay the onset of puberty in the female rat; however, the mechanism of this action is unknown. Thus, we evaluated the in vitro effects of ETOH on basal and stimulated LHRH and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion from the median eminence (ME) of prepubertal female rats. Brains were removed, and MEs dissected under a stereomicroscope, rinsed, and preincubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate glucose buffer in an atmosphere of 95% O2-5% CO2 for 15 min. These media were discarded, and individual MEs were subjected to one of the following three experiments. In the first experiment, all MEs were incubated for 30 min in medium only. The media were collected and replaced in the control vials, again with medium only, or in the test vials with medium containing ETOH in doses from 15-70 mM. After this 60-min incubation, the media again were collected, then replaced with the respective control or test medium, each containing norepinephrine (NE; 60 microM). Another experiment was conducted as described above, except that the MEs were challenged with PGE2 (2.8 microM) in place of NE. In both experiments the amount of LHRH released into these media was measured by RIA. In a third experiment, NE was used for the challenge; however, this time the amount of PGE2 released was measured by RIA. Our results indicate that ETOH did not alter basal LHRH release but, compared with controls, significantly blocked NE-induced LHRH release in a dose-related manner. Conversely, ETOH had no effect on the PGE2-induced release of LHRH. Additionally, ETOH did not alter basal PGE2 release; however, it significantly blocked the NE-induced release of PGE2. We know that stimulation of LHRH release by NE is mediated by PGE2. Thus, these results suggest that the inhibitory effect of ETOH on LH release in the prepubertal female rat is due, at least in part, to the diminished secretion of LHRH resulting from altered PGE2 release from within the ME.\r"

The present study used cAMP analogs selective in their binding to the two types of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK-A) and/or selective in their binding to the two cAMP-binding sites on the regulatory subunits of PK-A. As the two cAMP-binding sites show positive cooperativity, synergistic increases in androgen production by rat Leydig cells occurred when they were incubated in vitro with analog pairs that selectively activated PK-A type I or II. This confirmed that both types of PK-A are present in Leydig cells and demonstrated that both PK-A types are capable of activating steroidogenesis. Synergistic increases in androgen production were also observed when either a type I selective analog (8-aminohexylamino-cAMP) or a type II selective analog (8-thiomethyl-cAMP) was paired with added cAMP. However, when these analogs were paired with LH or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, a synergistic increase in steroidogenesis occurred only with the type I selective analog. These results suggest that PK-A type I is compartmentalized in Leydig cells so that it has preferential access to endogenously produced cAMP.\r"

We examined the interactions of steroid hormones and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) during DNA and sulfated proteoglycan synthesis in rabbit costal chondrocytes. Progesterone at 0.05 nM stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA by 30% above the control level in confluent cultures, but neither testosterone nor 17 beta-estradiol stimulated DNA synthesis. None of the hormones affected [3H]thymidine incorporation stimulated by IGF-I when chondrocytes were incubated with one of the hormones and IGF-I simultaneously. In contrast, when confluent cultures were incubated with one of the sex steroids for 24 h before the addition of IGF-I, stimulation of DNA synthesis by the growth factor was enhanced about 45% above the control value by 0.5 nM progesterone, 50% by 0.5 nM testosterone, and 80% by 50 nM 17 beta-estradiol. The effects of IGF-I on proteoglycan synthesis, as judged by the incorporation of [35S]sulfate, were stimulated by treatment with progesterone or testosterone. Dexamethasone at physiological concentrations inhibited chondrocyte DNA synthesis in confluent cultures to 10% of the control level. At 50 nM, dexamethasone suppressed IGF-I induction of DNA synthesis by 60%. This suppression was greater when dexamethasone was added before IGF-I than when the additions were simultaneous. When chondrocytes were treated with hydrocortisone or dexamethasone for 24 h before the addition of IGF-I, the glucocorticoids synergistically accelerated proteoglycan synthesis mediated by IGF-I. These findings suggest that steroid hormones have priming effects on the biological action of IGF-I in cartilage metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Human neonatal fibroblasts in monolayer culture produce insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), the IGF-binding subunit of the circulating 140-kDa IGFBP complex. We now report that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) is a potent stimulator of IGFBP-3 production by fibroblasts. After 72-h incubation with 1 ng/ml TGF beta, the levels of IGFBP-3 in conditioned medium were increased 5.8 +/- 1.2-fold (mean +/- SE; n = 9). Half-maximal stimulation of IGFBP-3 production was seen at 0.4 +/- 0.05 ng/ml TGF beta (n = 4). Coincubation of fibroblasts with TGF beta and either IGF-I or IGF-II at 50 ng/ml enhanced IGFBP-3 production 1.5- to 2-fold compared to TGF beta alone. As previously reported, fetal calf serum (FCS) stimulated IGFBP-3 production 5- to 6-fold; 1 ng/ml TGF beta increased the stimulated production of IGFBP-3 by FCS a further 2.5- to 3.5-fold. Acidification of FCS before addition enhanced the stimulation of IGFBP-3 compared to that caused by untreated FCS, but decreased further potentiation by TGF beta. This effect of acidified FCS was reversed by a neutralizing antibody to TGF beta. Similarly, the stimulation of IGFBP-3 levels by human serum or conditioned serum-free fibroblast medium was significantly increased by acidification of serum or medium before addition and was reversed by TGF beta antibody. These observations are consistent with acid-mediated activation of latent TGF beta added in serum or secreted by fibroblasts. Since IGFBP-3 is known to regulate IGF activity in fibroblasts, these results raise the possibility that TGF beta may modulate IGF actions in these cells by stimulating the production of IGFBP-3.\r"

  ".W": "The role of protein kinase-C-dependent mechanisms in steroidogenic enzyme gene expression was studied in primary cultures of human fetal and adult adrenals. Cells were first cultured for 7-10 days and then stimulated with ACTH or 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a protein kinase-C activator, for 1-2 days. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern and dot blotting with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for P450scc (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme/20,22-desmolase), P450c17 (17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase), and P450c21 (21-hydroxylase); for P450c11 (11 beta-hydroxylase/18-hydroxylase/18-methyl oxidase), a 30-mer oligonucleotide was used as a probe. ACTH (200 ng/ml) increased the accumulation of all of the studied steroidogenic enzyme mRNAs in both fetal and adult cultures by several-fold. TPA inhibited this accumulation in a dose-dependent manner (0.01-100 ng/ml), whereas the inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate was without effect. On the other hand, in the absence of ACTH, TPA slightly increased all steroidogenic P450 mRNAs in adult cultures. In fetal cultures TPA slightly increased P450scc, P450c11, and P450c21 mRNA levels, whereas it decreased P450c17 mRNA. (Bu)2cAMP and cholera toxin increased steroidogenic enzyme mRNAs such as ACTH. TPA down-regulated (Bu)2cAMP- and cholera toxin-induced P450mRNAs in the same way as ACTH-induced mRNAs. The secretion of ACTH-stimulated cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and aldosterone was decreased by TPA in both fetal and adult cultures. The basal steroid production was slightly increased by TPA in both culture types. The changes in steroid production correlated well with the alterations in the steroidogenic enzyme gene expression. Our results show that the inhibitory effect of TPA on ACTH-stimulated adrenal steroidogenesis is mediated at the mRNA level of steroidogenic enzymes. Thus, it seems likely that both protein kinase-C- and cAMP-dependent mechanisms are involved in the long term maintenance of steroidogenic enzymes and hormone production in adrenocortical cells.\r"

  ".W": "GH receptors have not hitherto been demonstrated or characterized on osteoblasts. In this study we report the characterization of functional GH receptors on the clonal rat osteoblast-like cell line UMR 106.06. The receptors have a typical somatogenic specificity, with high affinity for human GH, 10-fold lower affinity for rat GH, and very poor affinity for rat PRL. The affinity for rat GH is 1.2 +/- 0.4 x 10(9) M-1, and there are approximately 9000 receptors per cell. GH binding increased over several hours when incubations were carried out in serum free minimal essential medium, but binding reduced rapidly when incubations were carried out in Tris-NaCl-Mg++, HEPES, or bicarbonate buffer, suggesting a critical dependence of receptor expression on nutritional factors. Rat GH stimulated proliferation of UMR 106.06 cells in a dose-dependent fashion with a maximum 43 +/- 2% stimulation above control and half-maximal effect at a final hormone concentration of 15 +/- 3 ng/ml. A proliferative response was not observed at low cell density, suggestive of a requirement for a threshold concentration of autocrine mediators or density-dependent receptor expression. A monoclonal antibody (MAb 263) which blocks GH binding to a subset (type 1) of rat hepatic GH receptors did not block binding to osteoblast GH receptors, and did not block the proliferative response. Thus, the proliferative response appears to be mediated by a class of GH receptors not blocked by MAb 263 and possibly related to the type 2 hepatic GH receptors. RNA was extracted from UMR 106.06 cells and a second osteoblast-like cell line UMR 201. Hybridization to a 32P-labeled complementary DNA probe to the rabbit hepatic growth hormone receptor revealed two major labelled bands (3.5 and 1.2 kilobases) and one minor band (2.4 kilobases) in both cell types. In summary, GH receptors are present in clonal osteoblast-like cells, and the receptors mediate a proliferative response to GH. The UMR 106.06 cells provide a valuable model system for studying the mechanism of GH action.\r"

ET-3, the predominant member of the ET family in brain, exerted significant dose-related (1, 10, and 100 nM) inhibitory effects on PRL release from dispersed anterior pituitary cells in static incubations. The effect was not dependent on voltage-sensitive calcium channels, since the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist nifedipine failed to block this action. Nifedipine did, however, significantly reduce the transient acute stimulatory effect of ET-3 on PRL release in cultured cells incubated in dynamic perifusion. The longer lasting inhibitory effect on PRL release that followed the brief stimulatory action was not affected by nifedipine. ET-3 also stimulated a transient but significant release of LH from cells harvested from random cycle female rats, an effect that was not antagonized by a LHRH antagonist, but was blocked by nifedipine, suggesting the mobilization of extracellular calcium as a mechanism of action of ET-3. Nifedipine also reversed the acute stimulatory effect of ET-3 on GH secretion from these cells. Cerebroventricular injections of ET-3 (6 or 60 ng) failed to significantly alter PRL or LH secretion in conscious rats, suggesting that brain-derived ET does not act within the hypothalamus to alter the release of these two hormones. Similarly, iv infusion of even pressor doses of ET-3 (10, 30, or 300 ng) failed to significantly alter PRL, LH, or GH release; thus, it is unlikely that ET of peripheral origin acts within the gland. Our results suggest that locally produced ET may act as a neuroendocrine or paracrine factor controlling pituitary function in the rat.\r"

In the present study we have investigated the expression of ferritin mRNAs in cultured C6 cells, a rat glioma cell line, in response to insulin, which has an important role in cellular growth and differentiation. Insulin stimulated steady state levels of both ferritin heavy chain and ferritin light chain mRNAs. An increase in the level of ferritin heavy or light chain mRNA was detected after 2 h of incubation with insulin, and a plateau was reached after 48 h for heavy chain mRNA and after 72 h for light chain mRNA. The responses were dose-dependent and were maximal at 100 nM for both mRNAs. Treatment of cells with actinomycin-D showed that insulin had no effect on the posttranscriptional stability of these mRNAs. Actinomycin-D inhibited insulin-induced accumulation of both mRNAs, suggesting transcriptional stimulation of ferritin genes by insulin. A nuclear run-on assay showed that the insulin-induced increase in ferritin heavy chain mRNA was due to an increase in the rate of gene transcription. We also demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) increased ferritin heavy and light chain mRNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion, and that the maximum effect was obtained at a concentration of 10 nM on both mRNA levels. IGF-I was not only 10-fold more potent, but the absolute level of maximum stimulation was also about 2-fold greater than that for insulin. The combination of insulin (100 nM) and IGF-I (10 nM) showed no additive effect. The results suggested that the ferritin heavy and light chain genes are transcriptionally regulated by insulin and influenced by IGF-I.\r"

  ".W": "PRL secretion in the female rat is regulated by an endogenous stimulatory rhythm (ESR). This rhythm consists of two components: a nocturnal (N) component whose activity is greatest by 0300 h and a diurnal (D) component that peaks at approximately 1700 h. This periodicity coincides with the periods of the N and D surges of PRL in responses to the mating stimulus. Furthermore, we have shown that the ESR is involved in the regulation of mating-induced PRL surges. Mating causes a lowering of dopaminergic tone which reveals the ESR for PRL. The ability of immature female rats to express PRL surges induced by copulomimetic stimuli begins at 25 days of age. In this study we investigated the ontogeny of the ESR in immature female rats in order to observe the relationship between the onset of PRL secretion induced by copulomimetic stimuli and the development of the ESR. Immature female rats were raised in our colony and kept with their dams until used in an experiment or weaned at 23 days of age where appropriate. At 15, 20, 23, 24, 25, or 30 days of age female rats received a single ip injection of domperidone (DOM; 5 mg/kg) or saline vehicle at 0300, 1200, or 1700 h. Thirty minutes after the injection the rats were decapitated, and trunk blood was collected. PRL was measured by RIA. DOM had no effect on PRL secretion as compared to that in saline-treated controls at 15 days of age. However, in all other age groups DOM induced a significant increase in PRL levels compared to those in saline-treated animals regardless of the time of injection. In addition, there was no time of day difference in the PRL secretory response to DOM in rats 15-23 days of age. However, rats treated with DOM at 0300 h at 24 days of age secreted approximately 2-fold greater PRL than rats treated similarly at 1200 or 1700 h. Moreover, at 25 and 30 days of age, rats treated with DOM at either 0300 or 1700 h secreted significantly greater PRL than rats treated similarly at 1200 h. These results suggest that the ESR for PRL secretion begins by 24 days of age. In addition, they indicate that the hypothalamic developmental event preceding and required for expression of mating-induced surges of PRL is the establishment of the ESR.\r"

In acute studies, during the proliferation period, histone mRNA (reflecting DNA synthesis) was inhibited (20-60%). Matrix Gla protein (MGP) and OP mRNA were significantly elevated during proliferation (30- and 15-fold), in contrast to OC which is not expressed and was not induced by hormone treatment. OP and MGP remained stimulated throughout the developmental sequence, but to a lesser degree (from 6- to 10-fold). Collagen and AP mRNA were inhibited by hormone at their peak levels of expression, but were stimulated at their lowest basal levels in the mineralization period. OC expression, which was initiated at the onset of mineralization, was stimulated 13- to 15-fold when basal levels were low, then from 6- to 8-fold by hormone throughout its period of expression. In chronic studies a different profile of gene expression was observed. When hormone treatment was initiated during the proliferation period on day 6, type I collagen and AP expression were suppressed, mineralized nodules did not develop, and induced levels of OP and OC gene expression did not occur. When chronic treatment was initiated on day 20 after the development of a mineralized matrix, OC, but not collagen and OP, levels were stimulated by the hormone. This observation is consistent with the requirement of a competent or mineralized bone matrix for expression of OC. In contrast, MGP expression was stimulated in the chronic vitamin D-treated cultures similar to acute treatments. Taken together these studies demonstrate that vitamin D, a physiological mediator of bone formation and remodelling, can both positively and negatively regulate expression of osteoblast phenotypic markers as a function of duration of hormone treatment and basal levels of gene expression, which is a reflection of bone matrix competency and the differentiated state of the osteoblast.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that the liver contributes to the galactopoietic effects of PRL was assessed in lactating rats in which endogenous PRL secretion was suppressed by injections of bromocriptine. Pup weight gain over a 5-day period (i.e. days 7-12 of lactation) was used as an index of lactational performance in dams. Osmotic minipumps were used to infuse different doses of ovine (o) PRL into either the external jugular vein (JV) or the hepatic portal vein of the dams at a constant rate. The latter route of delivery would directly expose the liver to a higher concentration of PRL than would the former one. Twice daily sc injections of bromocriptine (1.5 mg/kg.injection) in corn oil into the dams completely suppressed litter weight gain. Infusion of oPRL into the JV at a dose of 2.0 mg/rat.day restored lactation to normal in the drug-treated mothers. Electrophoretic analysis indicated that about 95% of the oPRL remained in the intact monomeric form when incubated in the infusion solvent in the minipump at 37 C for 2 days, but by 4 and 6 days of incubation the amounts of that form decreased by about 25% and 50%, respectively. Measurement of serum oPRL levels by RIA showed that they were fairly constant, and after 5 days of infusion, the final concentration was directly related to the dose infused. Continuous infusion of oPRL into the JV was equally effective at restoring pup weight gain as was infusion into the hepatic portal vein over a wide range of doses. Hence, a physiological role of the liver in the maintenance of lactation by PRL is not supported by these experiments.\r"

  ".U": "91153245\r", 
  ".W": "In a previous study we found that PTH stimulated bone resorption and release of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-II from cultured neonatal mouse calvaria. Since IGF-I and IGF-II stimulate osteoblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, these results suggested that increased release of IGFs during resorption could mediate in part coupling of bone formation to bone resorption. In the present study two other osteolytic agents, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3 were examined for effects on IGF release from neonatal mouse calvaria. Like PTH, TGF beta stimulated resorption and increased release of IGF-I and IGF-II. 1,25-(OH)2D3, however, stimulated resorption and IGF-II release comparable to PTH, but inhibited release of IGF-I. 1,25-(OH)2D3 (0.1-100 nM) inhibited basal release of IGF-I, and 10 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited release of IGF-I induced by PTH or TGF beta. The effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 were specific to this vitamin D metabolite and did not occur with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 or 24,25-(OH)2D3 at the same concentration. Calcitonin (50 mU/ml) decreased 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation of resorption, but did not affect 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation of IGF-II release and inhibition of IGF-I release. This evidence that effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on release of the IGFs were independent of bone resorption supports the conclusion that 1,25-(OH)2D3 modulated the production and secretion of IGF-I and IGF-II in calvarial cells. The results of this and the previous study suggest that PTH, TGF beta, and 1,25-(OH)2D3 differentially regulate mouse calvarial cell IGF-I and IGF-II production.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were conducted to further evaluate inositol phosphate formation and metabolism in prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha)-stimulated bovine luteal cells. Corpora lutea were dispersed with collagenase, and luteal cells were prelabeled for 3 h with [3H]inositol. Inositol phosphates produced in response to PGF2 alpha were analyzed by ion exchange column chromatography and HPLC. Time-course experiments revealed that significant increases in inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) were apparent within 5 sec of incubation with PGF2 alpha. Increases in inositol bisphosphate (InsP2) were also apparent within 5 sec. InsP1 and InsP4 were observed after a short (5-sec) lag period. HPLC revealed that PGF2 alpha provoked rapid (5 sec) increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 1,4,5-P3), which was rapidly converted to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins 1,3,4,5-P4) and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins 1,3,4-P3). The primary inositol bisphosphate isomer present in PGF2 alpha-stimulated bovine luteal cells was inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Ins 1,4-P2), with lesser amounts of Ins 1,3-P2. Inositol monophosphates were also increased. These findings were confirmed in studies in which the metabolism of purified [3H]Ins 1,4,5-P3 was followed temporally in saponin-permeabilized bovine luteal cells. Additional studies demonstrated the presence of an enzyme, InsP3-3-kinase, in the cytosolic fraction of bovine corpora lutea. InsP3-3-kinase phosphorylated Ins 1,4,5-P3 to form Ins 1,3,4,5-P4. The activity of InsP3-3-kinase was calcium dependent and was enhanced by calmodulin at low calcium concentrations. Calmidazolium, a calmodulin inhibitor, reduced InsP3-3-kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. These results demonstrate the presence of multiple polyphosphorylated inositol phosphates in PGF2 alpha-stimulated bovine luteal cells. The isomers were formed via the action of a specific calcium/calmodulin-regulated kinase (InsP3-3-kinase), which phosphorylated Ins 1,4,5-P3 during agonist-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. These data suggest that the inositol tris/tetrakisphosphate pathway is an important sequelae to PGF2 alpha-stimulated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, and that the pathway may be activated during agonist-mediated calcium mobilization.\r"

  ".U": "91153248\r", 
  ".W": "To determine whether signals occurring during the early stages of undernutrition can have a suppressive effect on the central drive to the reproductive axis, the effects of 1 day of fasting on pulsatile LH and testosterone secretion were examined in adult male rhesus monkeys. Monkeys were maintained with chronic indwelling venous catheters on tether/swivel systems. One day of fasting caused a small weight loss of 0.1-0.2 kg, which represented a loss of 1-3% of the initial body weight. On a day of normal feeding monkeys showed a mean of 4.57 +/- 0.53 LH pulses/12 h (measured from 1900-0700 h). On a subsequent day of fasting LH pulse frequency was significantly reduced to 1.86 +/- 0.46 pulses/12 h (P less than or equal to 0.05). Likewise, there was a similar decrease in testosterone pulse frequency on a day of fasting. The substantial decrease in LH/testosterone pulse frequency was not caused by the intensive blood-sampling regimen, in that collection of blood samples for 12 h on 2 consecutive days of normal feeding did not result in a decrease in either LH or testosterone pulse frequency. Administration of exogenous GnRH in doses of 0.05-0.3 microgram/kg caused LH pulses of similar magnitudes on a day of normal feeding and a day of fasting, suggesting that the decrease in LH pulse frequency during the day of fasting reflects a decrease in GnRH stimulation of the pituitary rather than a loss of pituitary sensitivity to GnRH. Measurement of pulsatile LH across 3 consecutive days (e.g. a day of normal feeding, a day of fasting, and a day of refeeding) indicated that LH pulse frequency is slow before the time that the meal is missed on the second day and remains low throughout the day of fasting (normal feeding, 7 +/- 1.16 pulses/24 h; fasting, 3.33 +/- 0.33 pulses/24 h). Refeeding a normal meal at 1100 h on the third day resulted in an immediate and sustained increase in pulsatile LH secretion above normal frequency (11.07 +/- 0.33 pulses/24 h). These results indicate that very brief periods of undernutrition can significantly suppress the central drive to the reproductive axis in male rhesus monkeys, and this suppression can be rapidly reversed by refeeding. These findings argue against the hypothesis that undernutrition only suppresses central drive to the reproductive axis once a substantial amount of body weight has been lost.\r"

The AI mAb were tested for their effects on the TSH receptor-adenylate cyclase system. Four AI mAb behave as agonists of TSH as they compete with TSH for binding to the receptor and stimulate the adenylate cyclase activity. Five AI mAb inhibited both TSH binding to the receptor and adenylate cyclase activity in the presence and absence of TSH; they were thus considered as antagonists of the hormone. One mAb inhibited only slightly the binding of TSH to the receptor and did not interfere significantly with the adenylate cyclase activity. The 10 AI mAb bound with various apparent affinities to solubilized thyroid membrane proteins but not to kidney, spleen, and liver membranes. Membrane desialylation did not significantly alter the binding of the AI mAb whereas deglycosylation modified more or less strongly the binding of mAb to thyroid membranes. It was also shown that the binding to solubilized thyroid membranes of the 10 mAb was inhibited by anti-TSH receptor autoantibodies present in patients with autoimmune disease. The mAb were further analyzed by Western blot analysis. One mAb did not react with the antigen, which suggested that it was directed to a conformational epitope. The other 9 mAb reacted with a protein of 70 kilodaltons and 5 revealed another band of 93 kilodaltons in accordance with the TSH receptor size deduced from the recently molecular cloning.\r"

UE cells from immature rabbit were cultured on EHS (Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm) matrix-coated semipermeable filter inserts in a serum-free, phenol red-free defined medium. The cells in primary culture attached, proliferated, formed monolayers, and exhibited structural and functional polarity. Structural differentiation was validated by ultrastructural features, such as apical microvilli, intercellular junctions, desmosomes, and polar organization of apical vs. basal membrane domains. Trans-monolayer epithelial resistance, a reflection of functional tight junctions, preferential basal uptake of [35S]methionine, polarized distribution of labeled secretory proteins, and increased secretory activity marked by preferential apical secretion (greater than 90%) of proteins were indices of functional polarity. With the development and maintenance of polarized state by the UE cells, some of the newly synthesized proteins were sorted and vectorially secreted into their distinct compartments. De novo synthesis and exclusive apical secretion of uteroglobin (a progesterone-induced protein in vivo) by the polarized UE cells occurred in response to progesterone treatment in vitro. The hormone responsiveness was maintained for a prolonged period under these conditions. A culture system in which the UE cells maintain functional and morphological polarity and sustain their hormonal responsiveness facilitates the study of regulation of specialized functions by the UE cells that are regulated by steroid hormones and their interactions with the other uterine cell types.\r"

After weaning, mRNA and protein levels increased dramatically, corresponding to glandular involution. We also show that premature removal of the suckling stimulus caused a rapid increase in mRNA expression, but that translation of message was delayed, possibly until the gland was irreversibly committed to involution. Since high levels of annexin-I are associated with the quiescent epithelial cell, annexin-I may play an important role in blocking differentiation of the mammary gland.\r"

This peptide, termed MB-35, is a highly charged basic molecule of 35 amino acid residues and a mol wt of 3756. A computer-assisted search of published protein sequences has revealed that this peptide has a 100% homology with a region of the histone H2A. Biological studies using rat pituitary cells have revealed that MB-35 is active alone or in combination with GH-releasing factor (GRF) or TRH and can increase the production of GH and/or PRL beyond that achievable with GH-releasing factor and TRH alone. The observation that histone H2A, the parent molecule, is without activity is of keen interest, since it suggests that nucleoproteins may have heretofore unknown physiological activities, perhaps related to cell cycle and/or other events associated with DNA activation events.\r"

In contrast, CRF produces a monophasic sustained plateau type of ACTH secretory response. We have previously demonstrated that 1) influx of extracellular Ca2+ (Cae2+) via L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels is involved in both the response to CRF and the sustained phase of the response to AVP and OT; 2) release of intracellular Ca2+ (Cai2+) is involved in the spike phase of the response to AVP, OT, and AII; and 3) activation of protein kinase-C is required for the sustained phase, but not for the spike phase, of the response to AVP. CRF action is mediated by activation of protein kinase-A. In this study we further examined the role of Cai2+ by exploiting the fact that a low concentration (1 microM) of ionomycin, a potent Ca2+ ionophore, releases Cai2+ from nonmitochondrial inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive Cai2+ stores without causing Cae2+ influx. Pretreatment with ionomycin for 10 min decreased the spike phase of the response to 100 nM AVP, OT, and AII, but had no effect on the response to 10 nM CRF or the sustained phase of the responses to the other agonists. The combination of CRF plus AVP induced a biphasic and synergistic release of ACTH. Ionomycin pretreatment reduced the spike phase, especially the first 1 min, without any effect on the sustained phase. These results indicate that Cai2+ release, but not Cae2+ influx, is involved in the spike phase of the response to AVP, OT, and AII and that Cai2+ is not involved in the synergistic effect of the combination of CRF plus AVP. Having established these relationships, we examined the effect of 2-h perifusion with 100 nM dexamethasone (DEX) on stimulated ACTH release. DEX pretreatment reduced the total response to CRF, the sustained phase of the responses to AVP and OT, and the sustained phase of the synergistic response to CRF plus AVP. However, DEX had no effect on the spike phase of the responses to AVP, OT, or AII or the spike phase of the response to CRF plus AVP. These results indicate that DEX inhibits ACTH release mediated by activation of either protein kinase-A or protein kinase-C, but does not affect inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate/Cai2(+)-mediated ACTH release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the complex kinetics of human GH (hGH) binding to its receptors, we have further investigated, in IM-9 cultured human lymphocytes, the cellular locus corresponding to the slowly dissociating component of hormone binding, and to the homologous down-regulation of hGH receptors. First, we have detailed the biphasic kinetics of dissociation of bound hormone in control cells at 30 C. When the association at 30 C was extended from 0.5 to 3 h, the time required for half-dissociation of the fast component was slightly decreased (from 30 to 15 min) but that of the slow component increased considerably (from 6 h to 30 h). Concomitantly, the size of the slowly dissociating component increased from 50 to 80% of total. This indicates a maturation of bound hormone, from a rapidly to a slowly dissociating pool and, in the latter, an increase in the apparent affinity that may reflect a molecular rearrangement. Next, we have compared the effect of two procedures reported to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis at the level of coated pits. As previously reported, depletion of intracellular K+ abolished the slowly dissociating component and the down-regulation of hGH receptors. In contrast, upon incubation with 0.4 M sucrose, which like K+ depletion virtually abrogated hGH internalization, the dissociation kinetics remained non-first order, and the down-regulation of hGH-receptor was only slightly reduced. Thus, these procedures appear to block receptor-mediated endocytosis at two successive compartments of the cell surface. In conclusion, we propose that some conformational change of hGH-receptor at the cell surface (possibly associated with clustering) may considerably slow down their dissociation and may be sufficient for down-regulation.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms by which growth factors are degraded and the role this process plays in the regulation of cell growth are not well understood. Insulin degradation is believed to be mediated by a specific metalloprotease, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). We have previously shown that IDE can also degrade transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha), but not epidermal growth factor (EGF), in vitro. This selectivity was surprising, since TGF alpha and EGF are structurally similar and bind to the same receptor with comparable affinities. Using a spectrum of protease inhibitors, we have now analyzed the degradation of TGF alpha, EGF, and insulin by human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The results suggest that bacitracin-sensitive metalloproteases are involved in the degradation of TGF alpha and EGF as well as insulin, and that the degradation of TGF alpha, but not EGF, is mediated in part by IDE. Inhibiting the activity of these metalloproteases decreased growth factor depletion, suggesting that these enzymes play an important role in the control of extracellular growth factor levels. The existence of separate degradative pathways for EGF and TGF alpha may explain how the two factors exert differential effects in some systems, and degradation of TGF alpha by IDE would provide a possible mechanism for interaction between the insulin and TGF alpha/EGF signalling systems.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to gain further knowledge about the mechanism of action of recombinant interleukin-1 beta (rIL-1 beta) on rat pancreatic beta-cells, we studied the effects of short term rIL-1 beta exposure (50 U/ml for 1 h) on islet function over the next 72 h. There was an initial increase in glucose-induced insulin release, followed by a decrease in islet function, reaching a nadir (values of insulin release about 20% of those observed in control islets) 10-12 h after treatment with the cytokine. Thereafter, the islets recovered their function, reaching levels of insulin secretion similar to the control values after 72 h. Short term exposure to rIL-1 beta did not induce a decrease in either islet DNA or islet insulin content. Using this experimental approach, we tested whether 1-h incubation of islets in the presence of various agents plus rIL-1 beta could counteract the inhibitory effects of the cytokine 10-12 h later. Both actinomycin-D (5 micrograms/ml), an inhibitor of DNA transcription, and N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (0.1 mM), a protease inhibitor, could protect the islets. There was also a weak protection by dimethyl urea (61 mM), a free radical scavenger, but no protection by cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, or amiloride (12.5 microM), a blocker of Na+/H+ exchange. In a subsequent series of experiments, the islets were exposed for 6 h to different test agents after the initial 1-h exposure to rIL-1 beta. In this context, there was a clear protection by cycloheximide and actinomycin-D and a lesser protection by N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone. These data suggest that early steps of the actions of rIL-1 beta on rat pancreatic islets are mediated by protease activation and gene transcription, followed by protein synthesis. The identity of the protein(s) remains to be clarified.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that insulin regulates placental lactogen, progesterone, and estrogen production from human trophoblast cells. This study was performed to examine whether insulin also regulates the production of hCG by this type of cell. After 24-36 h of preincubation, JEG-3 and JAR cells (2-3 x 10(5) cells/ml.well) or human term trophoblast cells (1 x 10(6) cells/ml.well) were exposed to the test hormone in serum-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium for 24-96 h. Secretion of hCG from JEG-3 cells was stimulated by human insulin, human proinsulin, or porcine insulin in a dose-dependent manner, with lowest effective doses of 6.7, 96, and 53 mg/L, respectively. Time-course studies showed that hCG secretion peaked at 72-96 h with insulin exposure; in contrast, no decernable peak was seen without insulin in serum-free media. Exposure of JEG-3 cells for 24 h to 209 mg/liter insulin stimulated hCG synthesis, with 40 +/- 3% more immunoreactive intracellular hCG (P less than 0.05). Cells grown in the presence of insulin and [35S]methionine had 47 +/- 21% more labeled intracellular hCG and 56 +/- 13% more immunoprecipitable [35S]methionine-hCG secreted into the medium than the control cultures (P less than 0.05). During this time period, human placental lactogen release and total trichloroacetice acid-precipitable [35S]methionine protein were not increased. The insulin-induced stimulation of hCG synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. Additionally, insulin did not significantly affect total intracellular protein during 24-96 h of incubation. Insulin also increased hCG release from JAR cells, but not from human term trophoblast cells. A mouse monoclonal antibody to the IGF-I receptor inhibited the stimulation of insulin in JEG-3 cells. We conclude that insulin stimulates the synthesis and secretion of hCG from JEG-3 cells and JAR cells, and that hCG regulation in choriocarcinoma cells differs from that in primary human placental trophoblast cells. The effect of insulin on JEG-3 cells may be mediated in part through the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Using our new culture system for multinucleate cells (MNCs) that have many characteristics of osteoclasts, we examined the effects of factors produced by osteoblastic cells on osteoclastic cell formation. Conditioned medium (CM) from undifferentiated osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells during their growth phase inhibited MNC formation in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]. Diluted CM (1:81) from differentiated cells obtained after cultivation for more than 20 days stimulated MNC formation, but at lower dilutions inhibited their formation. Dialyzed CM (greater than 2000 mol wt) from the differentiated cells was more stimulatory than undialyzed CM and showed no inhibitory effect on MNC formation. The inhibitory effect was observed with filtered (less than 3000 mol wt) CMs and was specific for osteoblastic cell CM. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was detected in the CM from undifferentiated or differentiated MC3T3-E1 cells at concentrations (317 +/- 66 and 1287 +/- 179 pg/ml, respectively) sufficient to inhibit MNC formation, and this inhibition was partially abolished with CM (at 3-fold dilution) in indomethacin-treated cells (PGE2, less than 20 pg/ml), suggesting PGE2-mediated inhibition of MNC formation and the presence of another factor(s) besides PGE2 that influenced MNC formation. In contrast to day 3 CM plus 1,25-(OH)2D3, day 60 CM plus 1,25-(OH)2D3 induced MNC formation even in the absence of GM-CSF, and this induction was inhibited by an antibody to GM-CSF. Secondary colony formation assays showed the presence of a GM-CSF-like factor in the day 60 CM. These findings indicate that osteoblastic cells are involved in the process of osteoclastic cell formation, with at least two soluble factors produced by osteoblasts, a GM-CSF-like factor, which is stimulatory, and PGE2, which is inhibitory. The effects of CMs also differed depending on the stage of osteoblast differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the in vitro effect of cyclosporin-A (CyA) on bone resorption using a fetal rat long bone-resorbing assay. CyA inhibited both PTH-stimulated and unstimulated bone resorption. The inhibitory effect of CyA on basal resorption was dose dependent, and it was more pronounced during the second period (less than or equal to 0.1 microgram/ml) of culture (days 5-7) than during the first period (days 2-4). A cytotoxic effect was ruled out by the absence of decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation into bones up to a concentration of 5 micrograms/ml CyA. Histomorphometry performed after 4 and 7 days of culture showed that CyA (1 microgram/ml) decreased the number of osteoclasts per bone section after 7 days of culture (23.5 +/- 4.0 vs. 41.7 +/- 2.9 osteoclasts/bone section; P less than 0.05), but not after 4 days (25.6 +/- 3.3 vs. 23.0 +/- 2.5). These data suggested an effect of CyA on osteoclastic differentiation rather than on the function of mature osteoclasts. We further assessed the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of CyA on osteoclastic differentiation in order to determine 1) the level of this action (proliferation and/or fusion of osteoclast precursors), and 2) if this action is direct or indirect. Autoradiographic studies were performed on bone sections after incubation of bones with [3H]thymidine for the last 48 h of culture. CyA decreased slightly but significantly the percentage of labeled nuclei per osteoclast and the number of osteoclasts containing at least one labeled nucleus (20.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 33.2 +/- 3.5; P less than 0.02). Moreover the number of nuclei per osteoclast was decreased after 7 days in CyA-treated bones (2.4 +/- 0.05 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.1; P less than 0.02). Taken together these results demonstrate that CyA slightly decreased the proliferation of osteoclast precursors, but markedly decreased their fusion. Similar effects were observed in cultures of rat marrow macrophages. CyA (1 microgram/ml) inhibited the fusion of macrophages into multinucleated cells elicited by 1 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, but had only a slight effect on the proliferation of these cells, as assessed by autoradiography. CyA also inhibited the formation of multinucleated cells and the fusion index in long term cultures of human cord blood monocytes, a cellular model for osteoclastic differentiation. By contrast, CyA had no effect on the formation of myotubes by fusion of cultured mononucleated rat myoblasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adrenergic regulation of type II T4 5'-deiodinase (5'-D) activity has been studied in the rat pineal gland during development. Nocturnal increases in 5'-D activity gradually rose from the second week of age until the sixth week. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, stimulated 5'-D activity during the daytime; however, the pattern of stimulation during development was slightly different from nocturnal activation of the enzyme, since pineal 5'-D activity could be clearly activated by isoproterenol from the first week of age. Isoproterenol activation of the enzyme always reached more than 70% of nocturnal values at all ages studied. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, did not increase the enzyme activity. Another selective alpha-adrenergic agonist, methoxamine, as well as clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, were ineffective in stimulating the enzyme, while norepinephrine or terbutaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, clearly activated it. Additional results showing a role for alpha-adrenergic receptors on pineal 5-D activity were obtained when alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers were used. Thus, propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, clearly prevented pineal 5'-D activation in both 2- and 6-week-old rats when the gland was stimulated by either norepinephrine or darkness at night. However, prazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocker, also prevented the norepinephrine-induced or darkness-induced activation of the enzyme in 2-week-old rats, although it was ineffective when used in 6-week-old rats. Moreover, at night and after 3 h of exposure to darkness, phenylephrine was able to activate the enzyme. Results strongly suggest a role for alpha-adrenergic receptors, in addition to beta-adrenergic receptors, in regulating rat pineal 5'-D activity during development.\r"

All agents induced a rapid reduction of food intake and body weight after 1 day of treatment. Unlike TNF and LPS, IL-1 given as two daily administrations of 5 micrograms was lethal within 3 days. Mice treated with LPS or TNF rapidly developed tolerance to their anorectic effect, whereas tolerance to IL-1 required a longer time to develop and was not complete. We investigated the possible roles of changes in serum corticosterone and glucose in the effects of LPS, TNF and IL-1. A single injection of LPS, TNF, or IL-1 markedly increased serum corticosterone levels after 2 h. After only 2 days of chronic treatment, mice given LPS or TNF were refractory to induction of serum corticosterone by a subsequent injection of LPS or TNF, but mice given IL-1 for 2 days were still fully responsive to IL-1. IL-1, unlike TNF and LPS, induced a marked hypoglycemic response. Repeated administration of IL-1 sensitized to its hypoglycemic effect. This lack of adaptation to the increase of serum corticosterone and hypoglycemia was also observed when IL-1 was given at lower, nonlethal doses (0.25-1.0 microgram) and for a longer period (up to 8 days). The defective tolerance to the metabolic and toxic effects of IL-1 in this experimental model indicates that there are major differences between the in vivo biological responses to IL-1 and TNF.\r"

In E6 and E7 animals, many more LHRH-IR neurons were observed in nasal epithelium, in close association with the olfactory nerve, and within the telencephalon. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that LHRH neurons in chicks originate within nasal structures and migrate into the brain.\r"

To do this, total RNA was extracted from hypothalamic tissue, anterior pituitaries and from lymphocytes, and then this was reverse transcribed to cDNA and amplified via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizing synthetic oligonucleotides bracketing a portion of the LHRH gene. Following gel electrophoresis a discrete band of the expected size of 375 base pairs was found in the hypothalamus (positive control), and in lymphocytes, but not in the anterior pituitary (negative control). Furthermore, after Southern blotting, a 32P-labelled LHRH cDNA, hybridized to the 375 base pair, was amplified in hypothalamus fragments and in lymphocytes, but not in anterior pituitary tissue. These data strongly suggest that LHRH, in addition to being an important neuropeptide, is an immune cell synthesized immunomodulator.\r"

  ".W": "Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin, a recently discovered minor secretory peptide of the beta-cell related to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), is a constituent of amyloid deposits in the islets of many non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetic individuals and some elderly nondiabetic subjects. IAPP is synthesized as a small precursor at a level of approximately 1% that of insulin and is processed, amidated, stored in beta-granules, and released along with insulin and C-peptide. Analysis of its gene (located on chromosome 12) supports an evolutionary relationship to calcitonin and CGRP, peptides with which it shares some biological actions. Like CGRP, IAPP antagonizes the action of insulin mainly at the level of muscle glycogen synthesis, but the levels required for this effect seem to be considerably higher than reported circulating levels. No evidence for overproduction of IAPP in diabetic subjects has been found thus far, but much more work is necessary to define its normal secretory rates and clearance. Other proposed actions of IAPP include serum calcium-lowering effects and smooth muscle relaxation; the latter effect might promote the uptake of insulin into the circulation within the islets. Deposition of amyloid is species selective due to structural differences within the central part of the molecule and may be initiated intracellularly in type II diabetes by several mechanisms. No differences in the structure of IAPP or its precursor have been found in individuals with maturity-onset diabetes of the young or type II diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin is a newly identified 37-amino acid COOH-terminal-amidated polypeptide that is the major protein constituent of amyloid deposits in insulinomas and amyloid deposits in pancreatic islets of non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetic humans and adult diabetic cats. IAPP is stored with insulin in beta-cell secretory vesicles and is cosecreted with insulin in response to glucose and several secretagogues. IAPP has been demonstrated in normal pancreatic islets of many species, but IAPP-derived amyloid develops commonly in the islets of only a few species (e.g., humans and cats), especially in association with age-related diabetes. IAPP from the human and cat inherently contains a short amyloidogenic sequence that is not present in species that do not form islet amyloid. Studies in animals indicate that an aberration in the synthesis or processing of IAPP, leading to a local increase in concentration of IAPP in the islet, is also required to facilitate the conversion of IAPP to amyloid. The formation of islet amyloid may contribute to the development of type II diabetes by causing disruption of islet cells and by replacement of islets. It has also been proposed that an abnormality of IAPP homeostasis underlies the pathogenesis of type II diabetes. A significant causal relationship between IAPP and type II diabetes is based on reports that IAPP inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin release by beta-cells and that IAPP inhibits insulin-stimulated rates of glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake by skeletal muscle cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal domain of the GLUT1 glucose transporter (Thr-Pro-Glu-Glu-Leu-Phe-His-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ala-Asp-Ser-Gln-Val) was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through the NH2-terminal of the peptide. An antibody was raised against this complex and affinity purified with the immobilized peptide. A second peptide, with tyrosine residue added to the NH2-terminal of the above peptide, was synthesized and used as a standard and iodinated for preparation of the radioactive ligand. The assay is highly reproducible, sensitive, and specific for the COOH-terminal domain of the GLUT1 glucose transporter. It has no cross-reactivity with the other glucose-transporter isoforms GLUT2 and GLUT4. Furthermore, the results obtained with this radioimmunoassay on the number of glucose transporters in human erythrocytes were in good agreement with previous studies based on cytochalasin B binding, suggesting that this radioimmunoassay is able to quantify the number of glucose transporters. The assay is completed within 4 h and can be used for simultaneous measurement of GLUT1 in many samples. In addition, it can be applied to the measurement of GLUT1 in several types of tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Fluorometry and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to measure the content of free CoA and the esters of acetate, malonate, succinate, and long-chain fatty acids in isolated perifused rat pancreatic islets exposed to 25 mM glucose or a mixture of fuels (25 mM glucose plus 10 mM glutamine, 10 mM lactate, and 1 mM pyruvate) to assess the role of intermediates of lipid metabolism as candidate metabolic coupling factors in the mechanism of fuel-induced insulin secretion. Insulin secretion was stimulated in a biphasic manner with the fuel mixture, showing twice the potency compared with high glucose alone. Islets perifused for 3 min with high glucose alone or the fuel mixture compared with 2.5 mM glucose showed a significant increase in malonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA and a decrease in acetyl-CoA. Free CoA and long-chain acyl-CoA levels were unaltered. Perifused islets stimulated with 25 mM glucose for 30 min showed a significant increase in succinyl-CoA and long-chain acyl-CoA and decrease in acetyl-CoA, whereas malonyl-CoA was not affected. However, when islets were stimulated by the fuel mixture for 30 min, malonyl-CoA was maintained at a high level, and the change in succinyl-CoA and long-chain acyl-CoA was similar to that observed in islets stimulated with 25 mM glucose alone. The acetyl-CoA concentration in the islets stimulated with the fuel mixture decreased slightly. These results confirm the viability of the hypothesis that malonyl-CoA and long-chain acyl-CoA serve as metabolic coupling factors in signal transduction when islets are stimulated by high glucose or glucose combined with other fuels.\r"

  ".W": "We typed 254 non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) Mexican Americans living in Starr County, Texas, for the three common apolipoprotein E (apoE) alleles. Typing was performed via DNA amplification and Hha I restriction. The allele frequencies (epsilon 2 = 0.041, epsilon 3 = 0.860, epsilon 4 = 0.099) were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (chi 2 = 0.60, df = 3) and did not differ from a random sample from the same population (chi 2 = 0.16, df = 2). Analysis of variance was used to test for mean differences in lipid, lipoprotein, and glucose levels among apoE types. Significant differences among types were detected for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol; P = 0.042, R2 = 2.6) and beta-lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.019, R2 = 3.3) levels. Mean LDL-chol in E2/3 individuals was 2.69 mM, E3/3 was 3.26 mM, and E4/3 was 3.36 mM. Mean beta-lipoprotein cholesterol in E2/3 individuals was 3.05 mM, E3/3 was 3.64 mM, and E4/3 was 3.67 mM. Based on these results, we conclude that the effects of the apoE polymorphism on lipid profiles and glucose levels are the same in NIDDM subjects as in nondiabetic Mexican Americans and other populations. Other studies investigating the role of apoE polymorphism in diabetic subjects have found increased triglyceride levels in individuals possessing an epsilon 2-allele and an increased frequency of the epsilon 2-allele in hyperlipidemic diabetic subjects. We found no significant difference in mean triglyceride levels among genotypes. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed, including DNA- versus protein-typing methods.\r"

Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by 65 mg/kg i.p. injection of streptozocin, and control rats were injected with vehicle 2 wk before the experiment. Blood glucose levels were significantly elevated in the diabetic group (26.3 +/- 1.3 mM) compared with the control group (8.4 +/- 1.6 mM). Before and during ICV infusion of clonidine (2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 45 min), urine flow and sodium excretion were measured from intact and denervated kidneys in anesthetized diabetic and control rats. The ICV infusion of clonidine significantly increased urine flow in both innervated and denervated kidneys from control rats but not from diabetic rats. There was a significant increase in sodium excretion during ICV infusion of clonidine from innervated kidneys of control rats, and denervation abolished this effect. In diabetic rats, clonidine failed to promote natriuresis from intact kidneys, and similar to control rats, did not promote natriuresis in denervated kidneys. This study demonstrates that 1) the diuretic response to the ICV infusion of clonidine is blunted in diabetic rats, and 2) a natriuretic response to the ICV infusion of clonidine is blunted in innervated kidneys of diabetic rats.\r"

In this study of diabetic rats, the level of hepatic glutathione was normal unless food intake was restricted. Thus, the previous report of a reduction in hepatic glutathione in diabetes is likely to be the result of food deprivation rather than diabetes alone. In contrast to changes characteristic of oxidative stress, the efflux of glutathione in bile from diabetic animals was significantly decreased, whereas hepatic mixed disulfides were unchanged, and the hepatic gamma-glutamyltransferase activity was considerably increased. These changes were not reproduced by food deprivation. The decrease in biliary excretion of glutathione in diabetes may reflect an attempt to conserve glutathione by activation of the hepatic gamma-glutamyl cycle. We conclude that the disturbances of glutathione metabolism in diabetes are not typical of those seen in oxidative stress or food restriction.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the potential therapeutic use of pulsatile intravenous insulin delivery, five streptozocin-induced diabetic baboons were treated with alternate 3- to 6-wk periods of pulsatile and continuous insulin infusion. Time-averaged insulin concentrations were matched during two pulsatile administration periods (P1 and P2) and an intervening period of continuous insulin administration (C). There were no significant differences among the overall means of four daily glucose determinations performed during the three periods (P1, 5.7 +/- 1 mM; C, 5.6 +/- 0.9 mM; P2, 5.3 +/- 0.9 mM); the mean M value, a measure of the stability of glycemic control (P1, 4 +/- 1.7; C, 3.9 +/- 1.8; P2, 3.6 +/- 1.5); the percentage of glucose values less than 2.8 mM (P1, 13 +/- 8.5%; C, 14 +/- 12%; P2, 13 +/- 9.1%); or the glycosylated hemoglobin levels determined at the end of the P1 and C (7.5 +/- 3.4 and 6.5 +/- 1.8%, respectively [all values are means +/- SD]). Fasting hepatic glucose production was suppressed to a similar degree during pulsatile and continuous insulin infusion (P1, 23 +/- 3 mumol.kg-1.min-1; C, 24 +/- 8 mumol.kg-1.min-1). Arterial glucagon levels were similar during pulsatile and continuous insulin infusion, both in the fasting state (84 +/- 29 and 84 +/- 31 ng/L, respectively) and postprandially (30 +/- 14 and 27 +/- 12 ng/L, respectively). Pulsatile insulin infusion failed to entrain a corresponding glucagon secretory rhythm. These data suggest that the metabolic consequences of long-term pulsatile and continuous insulin infusion in an animal model of human non-insulin-dependent diabetes are comparable.\r"

Plasma glucose was reduced from approximately 5 to approximately 2.8 mM over 240 min with serial assessment of counterregulatory hormone levels and symptom awareness. The plasma glucose level that triggered a sustained rise in plasma epinephrine was consistently higher in nondiabetic children than in adults (3.9 +/- 0.06 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.06 mM, P less than 0.001). Poorly controlled IDDM further elevated the glucose threshold for epinephrine release to normoglycemic levels (4.9 +/- 0.2 mM, P less than 0.001 vs. both control groups). Age and IDDM also produced an upward shift in the glucose level at which growth hormone release and symptom awareness were initiated. In contrast to the effect on glucose thresholds, maximal epinephrine responses and symptom scores were increased only by age and not IDDM (2-fold higher in children). We conclude that childhood and poor diabetes control independently contribute to an upward shift in glucose thresholds for counterregulatory hormone release and symptom awareness during mild hypoglycemia. Normoglycemic counterregulation may interfere with efforts to control diabetes in young patients.\r"

This study explored the immunobiological consequences of regulation of insulin-receptor display by acute manipulations of insulin achieved during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in healthy normal individuals and obese subjects. T lymphocytes were isolated at 0, 1, and 4 h of hyperinsulinemia from seven normal volunteers and seven obese individuals and studied for their capacity to 1) synthesize a complement of insulin receptors on cell membrane, 2) respond to alloantigen in the mixed-lymphocyte culture (an immunologic activity unrelated to manipulations in insulin concentrations in complete medium), and 3) respond to the lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity reaction (an immunologic activity known to be modulated by insulin). In the face of a reduction in receptor numbers to 25% of baseline in normal individuals, alloreactivity in the mixed-lymphocyte culture was not affected (95 +/- 9% of time 0 after 4 h of hyperinsulinemia), whereas lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity fell from 14 +/- 4 at time 0 to 2 +/- 2% sp Cr release (P less than 0.02). Hyperinsulinemia achieved by the clamp in seven obese subjects did not alter the synthesis of insulin receptors on cell membrane after presentation of alloantigen. In the absence of further reduction of insulin-receptor membrane display, neither the mixed-lymphocyte culture nor lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity reaction was affected. It is concluded that those immunologic activities of lymphocytes that can be modulated by insulin are affected by regulation of insulin-receptor display on activated lymphocytes. Therefore, receptor regulation is not effete but carries significant immunologic consequence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A decrease of plasma ascorbic acid has been reported in diabetes and thus may play a role in the collagen and proteoglycan abnormalities in diabetes. Ascorbic acid and glucose share structural similarity, and their metabolism may interact at the level of membrane transport and cellular action. In this study, we used a fibroblast culture system to explore this possibility. Ascorbic acid increased collagen and proteoglycan both in the culture medium and the cell layer. This stimulatory action of ascorbic acid was inhibited by the presence of glucose at a concentration of 25 mM. The effect of high glucose concentration was not mediated by inhibition of ascorbic acid uptake by fibroblasts. Insulin is able to abolish this inhibitory action of glucose on collagen production, but the precise mechanism is unclear. These results show that the high glucose concentration in diabetes can impair the action of ascorbic acid at the cellular level. This may further accentuate the problem of decreased availability of this vitamin as a result of its low plasma concentration.\r"

Because binding of HDL to its receptor is required for HDL-receptor-mediated cholesterol efflux from cells, we hypothesized that glycosylated HDL3 would have reduced ability to remove cholesterol from cells. HDL3 was glycosylated in vitro to achieve up to 40-50% reductions in free-lysine residues. Glycosylated HDL3 had a slightly greater ability than control HDL3 to sequester cholesterol directly from the plasma membrane, as predicted by changes in lipid composition. This process is independent of HDL-receptor binding and should not be influenced by reduced binding of HDL3. In contrast, efflux of intracellular cholesterol from cells, which is HDL-receptor dependent, was reduced 25-40%. The ability of glycosylated HDL3 to diminish cholesterol esterification was significantly reduced, indicating reduced net cholesterol efflux. Steady-state efflux of LDL-derived cholesterol was also markedly reduced. These findings suggest that nonenzymatically glycosylated HDL is functionally abnormal and might contribute to the accelerated development of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "Human calcitonin gene-related peptide (hCGRP-1) and human amylin (hA) have been reported to increase hepatic glucose output in vivo and to bind with high affinity to rat liver plasma membranes, resulting in increased cAMP production. These observations have led to the hypothesis that CGRP or amylin may be physiological regulators of liver glucose metabolism. Liver plasma membranes are derived from several cell types, including parenchymal (hepatocyte), Kupffer, endothelial, lipid storage, and smooth muscle cells. Because the parenchymal cell is responsible for the contribution of the liver to whole-body glucose homeostasis, it is important to verify the location and activity of the CGRP/amylin receptor to this cell. These studies separate liver cells prepared by collagenase digestion into parenchymal and nonparenchymal fractions by metrizamide gradient and differential centrifugation. 125I-labeled [Tyr-0]hCGRP-1 bound with high affinity to nonparenchymal cell fraction and was displaced by both hCGRP-1 and hA. hCGRP-1 bound with greater affinity than hA (Kd = 2.1 +/- 1.6 x 10(-11) vs. 2.6 +/- 1.2 x 10(-8) M) in a manner similar to the binding reported for liver plasma membrane fraction. Linear regression of receptor concentration against nonparenchymal cell count per milliliter was significant (r = 0.999, P = 0.026), leading to an estimate of 3000 receptors/cell. The parenchymal cell fraction bound very little 125I-[Tyr-0]hCGRP-1, and regression of receptor concentration against parenchymal cell count per milliliter was not significant (r = -0.708, P = 0.29), suggesting that binding was not due to parenchymal cells but instead to contamination by nonparenchymal cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we examined the effects of exercise training on the expression of genes potentially related to insulin synthesis and glucose-stimulated insulin release by measuring pancreatic islet proinsulin, glucose-transporter (GLUT2), and glucokinase mRNAs. Female Wistar rats were subjected to 100 min of running at 25 m.min-1 up a 15% incline for 90 min/day for 6 days/wk for 3 wk. Pancreatic mRNA was evaluated by Northern- and dot-blot analysis with [32P]cRNA probes. We found no change in the pancreatic content of GLUT2 mRNA but found marked decreases in the content of proinsulin mRNA (78%, P less than 0.005) and glucokinase mRNA (65%, P less than 0.001). These results suggest that exercise modulates both islet glucose metabolism and insulin synthesis at the level of gene expression. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the decreases in glucokinase and proinsulin mRNA concentrations (r = 0.95, P less than 0.001), suggesting that expression of these genes is regulated in parallel.\r"

All 200 male newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma patients were recruited consecutively through the period of study as the case group from two teaching medical centers in northern and southern Taiwan. Healthy community residents matched one-to-one with cases on age, sex, ethnic group and residential area were selected as the control group. The carrier status of HBsAg and HBeAg was determined by blind radioimmunoassays, and other risk factors were obtained through standardized interviews according to a structured questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between hepatocellular carcinoma and the carrier status of HBsAg and HBeAg with an odds ratio of 16.7 and 56.5, respectively, for carriers of HBsAg alone and for carriers of both HBsAg and HBeAg. There was a dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and hepatocellular carcinoma with an odds ratio of 1.1, 1.5 and 2.6, respectively, for those who smoked 1 to 10, 11 to 20 and more than 20 cigarettes a day. A significant association with hepatocellular carcinoma was also observed for the habitual alcohol consumer with an odds ratio of 3.4. Those whose immediate family had a history of hepatocellular carcinoma were more likely to have the disease develop, with an odds ratio of 4.6. However, the frequency of peanut consumption was not significantly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was designed to evaluate the hemodynamic response to vasopressin infusion in 25 HBsAg-positive cirrhotic patients. Nine patients had active variceal hemorrhage before vasopressin infusion, and the other 16 patients were in a stable condition at the time of infusion. The two groups of patients were similar in baseline values except that a higher heart rate was found in patients with hemorrhage (96 +/- 20 vs. 73 +/- 10 beats/min, mean +/- S.D., p less than 0.01). Thirty minutes after vasopressin infusion (0.66 units/min), hepatic venous pressure gradient significantly decreased in both bleeding and stable patients (from 21 +/- 9 to 18 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05; and from 18 +/- 4 to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001, respectively). However, the decrease of hepatic venous pressure gradient was less obvious in bleeding patients as compared with stable patients (4 +/- 3 vs. 9 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001).

We identified three subsets of patients: 13 with hepatitis D virus and hepatitis B virus viremia, 53 with serum hepatitis D virus RNA, but without hepatitis B virus DNA and 19 negative for both nucleic acids. Genomic and subgenomic forms of hepatitis D virus RNA were detected only in patients with hepatitis D virus and hepatitis B virus viremia. Histological findings and disease activity at admission were comparable in the three groups of patients, but the outcome was significantly worse in patients with active replication of both viruses; two of them died of terminal liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma developed in two; the remaining patients had an uneventful course. These results suggest that active hepatitis B virus replication represents an important previously unrecognized determinant of severe liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis D virus infection. Since hepatitis B virus provides the means for hepatitis D virus secretion and release from infected cells, active hepatitis B virus multiplication favoring the spread of hepatitis D virus from cell to cell may increase the pathogenetic potential of the defective agent.\r"

Liver biopsy samples and sera from 59 carriers with HBsAg were examined immunohistochemically for X protein using rabbit IgG against recombinant X protein. There was a significant difference in the serum hepatitis B virus DNA level between X protein-positive and -negative patients (p less than 0.001). Serum pre-S1 and pre-S2 antigens were also measured quantitatively by enzyme immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies specific against each antigen. The titers of pre-S1 antigen in patients positive for X protein were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than those of the X protein-negative patients (3.02 +/- 0.99 vs. 2.00 +/- 0.59, respectively).

In an effort to circumvent this problem, we have developed an in vitro system for screening anti-hepatitis B virus drugs using hepatitis B virus DNA-transfected Hep G2 cells. The cell line designated 2.2.15 produces replicative viral DNA intermediates, mature Dane particles and high levels of viral antigens. Subconfluent 2.2.15 cells were treated with a variety of commonly used anti-hepatitis B virus therapeutics, and their efficacy was determined by analyzing changes in the replicative cellular or extracellular hepatitis B virus DNA content by Southern blotting or slot-blot hybridization. The slot-blot method was sensitive, reproducible and rapid and correlated well with Southern blotting. Analysis of the media for hepatitis B virus DNA was indicative of changes in intracellular, replicative hepatitis B virus DNA, permitting sampling of the media. Therefore 2.2.15 cells may provide a valuable method for identifying and monitoring effective anti-hepatitis B virus therapeutics. Using this system to test various agents, we confirm that 2'-deoxyguanosine strongly inhibited viral replication, whereas others tested were less effective. Correlation with in vivo systems is now needed.\r"

To assess its usefulness in the Western form of this cancer, 30 French patients were treated between 1987 and 1990 by intraarterial hepatic injection of a Lipiodol-doxorubicin emulsion followed by embolization with 0.5 to 1 mm gelatin sponge particles. The number of procedures ranged from one to five. All patients had advanced, symptomatic and inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (Okuda's staging: I, n = 8; II, n = 14; III, n = 8); none was found under systematic screening. All had underlying cirrhosis (Child-Pugh's class: A, n = 15; B, n = 12; C, n = 3) that was alcoholic in origin in 27 cases and posthepatitic B in origin in 3 cases. The results of the treatment were assessed by comparison with a group of 30 untreated patients admitted to the same unit between 1984 and 1987. Patients of both groups were closely matched for clinical presentation, global disease staging and precise anatomical extension. The overall 1- and 2-yr survival rate was 59% and 30%, respectively, for the treated patients vs. 0% at 1 yr for the untreated patients. The latter all died from local disease with end-stage liver failure and/or uncontrollable variceal bleeding. In the former, the three patients with Child's class C cirrhosis died after the first procedure.

The usefulness of pulsed Doppler ultrasound for detection of this type of recurrence was compared with ultrasonography and computed tomography in 21 such hepatocellular carcinomas. Of 15 hepatocellular carcinomas diagnosed by angiography as showing recurrence, four were detected with ultrasonography and five were detected with computed tomography. Doppler signals were obtained in the peripheral portions corresponding to tumor vessels or stains on angiograms in 14 of these 15 hepatocellular carcinomas, but they were undetectable in six hepatocellular carcinomas with no recurrence. All signals disappeared after transcatheter arterial embolization. One false-negative hepatocellular carcinoma with pulsed Doppler ultrasound showed faint tumor stains on angiograms; these were also negative on ultrasonography and computed tomography. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound may be superior to ultrasonography and computed tomography as a routine procedure to detect the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma treated by transcatheter arterial embolization.\r"

The change in biliary phospholipids as a result of the reflux of pancreatic juice into the biliary tract through anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal junction may be responsible for it. We developed a new method of analysis of phospholipid classes using aminopropyl Bond Elut cartridge for extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography for separation. Satisfactory recovery was achieved (i.e., more than 95% for both phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine). With this method, the bile of 11 patients with anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal junction was examined. The concentration and proportion of lysophosphatidylcholine in bile were much higher in the presence of anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal junction than in controls (3.44 +/- 1.50 mmol/L vs. 0.52 +/- 0.25 mmol/L, 60.0% +/- 31.0% vs. 2.3% +/- 1.4% in gallbladder bile; p less than 0.001). In contrast, the concentration of phosphatidylcholine and the sum of phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine in gallbladder bile significantly decreased (p less than 0.001), but in hepatic bile they did not. An inverse correlation was found between the proportion of lysophosphatidylcholine and phospholipid concentration in gallbladder bile. Phospholipase A2 and amylase activities in bile were markedly high. Increased total fatty acid concentration and proportion of unsaturated fatty acid in bile were found. Total bile acid concentration in gallbladder bile was significantly lower than in controls. These results suggest that a considerable amount of lysophosphatidylcholine, which is known to have a cytotoxic effect, isp reduced by phospholipase A2 in refluxing pancreatic juice, and an increased concentration of lysophosphatidylcholine gives rise to cell damage causing mucosal hyperplasia and metaplasia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The concentrations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides, methionine, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and ammonia were measured in patients with different stages of hepatic encephalopathy, in patients with chronic kidney failure and in healthy subjects. In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, the mean serum concentrations of all these compounds were elevated. However, the elevations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides were small and partly caused by decreased renal function. In addition, the levels of methanethiol-mixed disulfides did not differ significantly between the different grades of hepatic encephalopathy. The concentrations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides were substantially lower than those previously observed in healthy subjects after an oral methionine load or in a patient with a deficiency in methionine adenosyltransferase, the latter without causing encephalopathy. We concluded that the role of methanethiol in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is probably minor, if not insignificant. In the patients with hepatic encephalopathy, a significant correlation was found between the concentrations of methionine and 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and between 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and methanethiol-mixed disulfides, supporting the theory that methanethiol is formed by way of the methionine transamination pathway. Evidence is provided that, besides the methionine transsulfuration pathway, the transamination pathway is also impaired in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

Conventional biochemical tests used for the detection of chronic alcohol consumption fail to differentiate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients from alcoholic subjects. In addition, even in those alcoholic subjects with alcoholic liver disease in whom biopsy has been performed, it is impossible to differentiate these two disease states on the basis of morphological examination alone. In this study we have examined two new markers of excessive alcohol intake, desialylated transferrin and mitochondrial AST in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and in patients consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. All nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients consumed minimal or no alcohol and were diagnosed by morphological criteria based on liver biopsy specimens. Alcoholic subjects were consuming in excess of 80 gm/day ethanol, often with clinical evidence of overt alcoholism. Control subjects included both healthy controls and patient controls with liver diseases unrelated to alcohol. The ratio of desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was elevated only in patients who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, whereas the ratio of mitochondrial AST to total AST (mitochondrial AST/total AST) was not significantly different between alcoholic subjects and patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The sensitivity and specificity for the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was 81% and 98%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity for the mitochondrial AST/total AST ratio was 92%; the specificity was only 50%, indicating that there were a large number of false-positives. All the conventional markers were less sensitive and less specific than the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The functional hepatic nitrogen clearance during amino acid infusion is a measure of liver cell mass. The clinical feasibility of the test has so far been limited by methodological problems. A simplified procedure was used to measure the urea-nitrogen synthesis rate and functional hepatic nitrogen clearance in nine subjects with normal liver function and in nine patients with cirrhosis. The method was based on only four consecutive 2-hr urine collections and five blood samples. Total body water was calculated from a nomogram based on age and anthropometric data, whereas the gut urea hydrolysis was assigned one fixed fraction of synthesis (0.17 in control subjects and 0.26 in patients with cirrhosis). Finally, a solution of a single amino acid, alanine, was infused as substrate for urea synthesis. Urea-nitrogen synthesis rate increased linearly with increasing alpha-amino-nitrogen concentration, and the slope of the regression (functional hepatic nitrogen clearance) was reduced in cirrhosis from 37.5 +/- 7.0 L/hr to 18.4 +/- 6.7 L/hr; p less than 0.005. The hepatic nitrogen clearance was linearly related to the clinical status (Child-Pugh score), to routine liver function tests and to galactose elimination capacity (r = 0.869), a well-established, quantitative, liver function measure. The simplified method makes the measurement of hepatic nitrogen clearance suitable for routine clinical use. The test might prove useful to study the alterations of nitrogen metabolism in cirrhosis, with special reference to hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Six components of the mammalian 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes have previously been identified as M2 autoantigens in primary biliary cirrhosis. In this report, we present data showing that both polypeptide-specific and cross-reacting antibodies are present in patients' sera. Antibodies reacting with E2 of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex cross-react with protein X but not with any other mammalian antigen. The main immunogenic region on protein X has been localized to within its single lipoyl domain. Polypeptide-specific antibodies bind to E1 alpha and E1 beta of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Antibodies reacting with the E2 polypeptides of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex show some cross-reactivity but do not recognize any of the antigens of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Antibodies against the E2 component of the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex cross-react effectively with the corresponding protein from yeast but not with E2 from Escherichia coli. Antibody titer against mammalian antigens is significantly higher than against the bacterial antigens, arguing against a bacterial origin for primary biliary cirrhosis.\r"

In this study we quantitated in needle-biopsy specimens the intrinsic capacity of liver tissue from 67 patients with mild liver disease (n = 36), chronic active hepatitis (n = 16) and cirrhosis (n = 15) to metabolize two model compounds in vitro. Hydroxylation of the low-extraction drug bufuralol resulted in the formation of 251 +/- 25 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/gm wet wt/hr in mildly diseased liver tissue and was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced in liver tissue exhibiting chronic active hepatitis (166 +/- 23 nmol/gm wet wt/hr) and cirrhosis (124 +/- 21 nmol/gm wet wt/hr). The formation rates of monoethylglycinexylidide, the main metabolite of the high-extraction drug lidocaine, varied widely and were not significantly different among the three groups. To relate the drug-metabolizing capacity to the hepatocyte content of liver tissue, morphometrical study was performed in the biopsy pieces originally submitted. The metabolic activity of each biopsy piece was then related to the fractional volume of hepatocytes it was calculated to contain. In mildly diseased liver tissue 355 +/- 35 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/ml hepatocytes x hr or 12.4 +/- 1.0 mumol monoethylglycinexylidide/ml hepatocytes x hr- and in cirrhotic liver tissue 306 +/- 49 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/ml hepatocytes x hr or 15.3 +/- 3.0 mumol monoethylglycinexylidide/ml hepatocytes x hr--were formed, respectively, and these differences were not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Passive sensitization of rats in vivo with monoclonal murine antidinitrophenol-IgE before antigen challenge in the isolated perfused liver system elicited a rapid hepatic production and biliary excretion of leukotrienes as judged by radioimmunoassay after separation of individual leukotrienes by high-performance liquid chromatography. Within 10 min after antigen infusion, mainly leukotriene C4, but also leukotriene D4 and N-acetyl-leukotriene E4, appeared in the bile. The biliary excretion rate of antigen-induced cysteinyl leukotrienes rose from less than 2 pmol.min-1.(kg body mass)-1 before challenge to about 30 pmol.min-1.(kg body mass)-1 for 20 min before it declined toward prechallenge level. Quantitatively similar hepatic production of cysteinyl leukotrienes was elicited in isolated perfused guinea pig livers challenged with ovalbumin after active sensitization of the animals with ovalbumin plus Al(OH)3. To exclude extrahepatic contributions to the observed leukotriene production, both passive sensitization with anti-dinitrophenol-IgE and subsequent antigen challenge were performed on isolated rat livers perfused with blood-free medium. Such exclusively hepatic sensitization and challenge also resulted in massive production of leukotrienes. The biliary excretion rate of cysteinyl leukotrienes amounted to approximately 20 pmol.min-1.(kg body mass)-1 during the 10 to 20 min period after antigen challenge as compared with less than 1 pmol.min-1.(kg body mass)-1 before challenge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To test further the competence of the cirrhotic liver to metabolize vitamin D3 at C-25, hepatocytes were isolated from controls and from CCl4-induced cirrhotic rat livers, as well as from partially hepatectomized rats. The transformation of D3 into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was studied in the presence of 10(7) hepatocytes at D3 concentrations of 20 nmol/L to 15.4 mumol/L. Histologically, micronodular cirrhosis was present in all CCl4-treated rats, whereas controls had normal livers; portal venous pressure (p less than 0.008) and intrahepatic collagen content (p less than 0.0001) were significantly increased in CCl4-treated rats, whereas no difference was found between the two groups in the total and ionized serum calcium, D3 metabolites, ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase. Cytochrome P-450 was 0.27 +/- 0.02 and 0.25 +/- 0.02 nmol/10(6) hepatocytes in controls and cirrhotic rats (N.S.), and it significantly increased in both groups after phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene administration (p less than 0.0001). 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 formation was best described by power law equations and varied between 0.02 +/- 0.0004 and 29.57 +/- 2.8 in controls, and 0.024 +/- 0.0004 and 32.0 +/- 7.0 pmol.hr-1.10(6) hepatocytes-1 in cirrhotic rats. No statistically significant difference was found in the slopes of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 formation, but the y-axis intercept was found to be lower in cirrhotic rats under basal resting conditions (p less than 0.005). Inducers of the mixed function oxidases significantly increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 formation in controls as well as in cirrhotic rats (p less than 0.005). Moreover, both groups were found to respond similarly to the addition of modulators of the enzyme such as the calcium ionophore A23187 and parathyroid hormone. Partial hepatectomy was also without effect on the activation of D3. Furthermore, the cell sequestration of D3 was also found to be unperturbed in hepatocytes obtained from either cirrhotic or partially hepatectomized livers. The data indicate that in well-compensated micronodular cirrhosis, the C-25 hydroxylation of D3 is generally intrinsically normal at the cellular level and that it also remains fully responsive to in vivo and in vitro modulators of its activity.\r"

Using these studies, improved methods of hypothermic liver preservation for transplantation may be developed. In this study, rat hepatocytes were cold-stored for up to 7 days in University of Wisconsin liver preservation solution. At the end of each day of storage hepatocytes were resuspended in Krebs-Henseleit buffer or tissue-culture medium (Liebovitz-15; Fischer's; modified Fischer's, which was similar to Fischer's but with glycine and cysteine added; or Waymouth's medium). Hepatocyte viability was assessed by rewarming and oxygenating the suspensions and measuring the percentage of leakage of lactate dehydrogenase from the cells, the cellular concentration of potassium and the stimulation of respiration by succinate, all measures of plasma membrane integrity. Additionally, concentrations of ATP and glutathione after rewarming and reoxygenation in the various resuspension media were measured. Hepatocyte permeability to lactate dehydrogenase did not increase during cold storage of 1 to 7 days (7.2% +/- 2% leakage), indicating that most of the hepatocytes remained viable during cold storage. However, when rewarmed, loss of viability (leakage of lactate dehydrogenase) was dependent on the composition of the resuspension media. In Krebs-Henseleit buffer, viability was reduced after 2 and 3 days of storage (lactate dehydrogenase leakage on rewarming = 70% to 90%). Leakage of lactate dehydrogenase was reduced significantly after resuspension in tissue-culture media. After 6 days of storage, lactate dehydrogenase leakage from hepatocytes stored in Liebovitz- 15 or modified Fischer's was only about 30%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pyridine dinucleotides and adenine nucleotides were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Exposure of the hepatocytes to 8 mmol/L ethanol resulted in a decrease in NAD+ and an increase in NADP+ after 2 min incubation. There were no significant changes in NADH and NADPH. Ethanol decreased ATP and increased AMP after 2 min, whereas an increase in ADP was only apparent after 15 min of incubation. Ethanol 8 mmol/L and 100 mmol/L resulted in an increased incorporation of [32P] into NADP+ from [32P]-prelabeled NAD+ and ATP. Ethanol increased hepatocyte NAD+ kinase activity; this effect was blocked by 4-methylpyrazole but reproduced by 10 mumol acetaldehyde. These observations indicate that ethanol increases the synthesis of NADP+ and that this effect is most likely the result of increased NAD+ kinase activity. The ethanol-induced decrease of NAD+ may limit ADP ribosylation of nuclear proteins, whereas increases in NADP+ may stimulate the pentose phosphate cycle.\r"

Closely paralleling the mitotic index, we observed fourfold increases in nuclear scaffold nucleoside triphosphatase, an activity thought to participate in nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport and in the 46 kD putative enzyme and its selective photolabeling. Because previous work has indicated that the 46 kD protein may be proteolytically derived from lamins A/C by cleavage at a tyrosine residue at aa376, we investigated the response of lamin A/C transcripts during this regeneration. Surprisingly, Northern blot analyses after CCl4 administration showed low levels of lamin A/C transcripts (which appeared to be predominantly poly[A]-), and we found a decrease in immunoprecipitable lamins A/C from in vitro translation of poly(A)- selected RNA. To circumvent potential problems with such analyses, we used reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplification of lamin A/C transcripts from total cytoplasmic RNA. These assays showed a transient, comparatively minor increase in lamin A/C transcripts 1 day after treatment, but levels rapidly declined from 1 to 3 days and were decreased at 3 to 5 days. However, nuclear scaffold protease activity, which shows a considerable selectivity for lamins A/C and may be involved in derivation of the 46 kD protein, increased in parallel to the mitotic response and increases in nucleoside triphosphatase, as assessed using a nonspecific (Azocoll) protease assay. Assays with a specific tyrosine-containing substrate (Z-Y-Sbenzyl) showed an increase that mirrored that observed with the nonspecific substrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the mechanism by which liver Golgi apparatus maintains the acidity of its contents, using a subcellular fraction from rat liver highly enriched in Golgi marker enzymes. Proton accumulation (measured by quenching of acridine-orange fluorescence) and anion-dependent ATPase were characterized and compared. Maximal ATPase and proton accumulation required ATP; GTP and other nucleotides gave 10% to 30% of maximal activity. Among anions, Cl- and Br- approximately doubled the activities; others were much less effective. Half-maximal increase of ATPase and H+ uptake required 55 mmol/L and 27 mmol/L Cl-, respectively. In predominantly chloride media, SCN- and NO3- markedly inhibited H+ uptake. Nitrate competitively inhibited both the chloride-dependent ATPase (apparent Ki 6 mmol/L) and proton uptake (apparent Ki 2 mmol/L). Nitrate and SCN- also inhibited uptake of 36Cl. Replacing K+ with Na+ had no effect on the initial rate of proton uptake but somewhat reduced the steady state attained. Replacement of K+ with NH4+ and choline reduced proton uptake without affecting ATPase. The ATPase and H+ uptake were supported equally well by Mg2+ or Mn2+. The ATPase was competitively inhibited by 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyano-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (apparent Ki 39 mumol/L). Other agents inhibiting both H+ uptake and ATPase were N-ethylmaleimide, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, chlorpromazine, diethylstilbestrol, Zn2+, Co2+ and Cu2+. In the Cl- medium, accumulated protons were released by ionophores at the relative rates, monensin = nigericin greater than valinomycin greater than carbonyl cyanide mchlorophenylhydrazone; the last of these also reduced ATPase activity. In the absence of Cl-, monensin and valinomycin both stimulated the ATPase. These results show a close association between ATPase activity and acidification of liver Golgi vesicles. They support a role for Cl- that depends on its uptake as a counter ion for H+ and suggest that it may also stimulate proton transport by a more direct effect on a component of the transport system.\r"

Type I and III collagen synthesis in the liver developed from perisinusoidal stellate cells that are often referred to as myofibroblasts. Immunohistologically these cells were shown to have large intracellular deposits of ferritin. The hepatic fibrosis appeared to be associated with aggregates of these cells rather than the aggregates of Kupffer cells, which also occur in hemosiderosis in the liver. No appreciable necrosis of hepatocytes to trigger the fibrotic response was found, so that the fibrosis appeared to be related to the accumulation of ferritin in the perisinusoidal stellate cells. In contrast, rats and mice did not accumulate ferritin in their perisinusoidal cells or develop hepatic fibrosis in response to parenterally administered iron, although they accumulated similar or greater amounts of total iron in their livers. The rapid induction of hepatic fibrosis in gerbils in response to parenterally administered iron will provide a model to investigate the mechanism of induction of collagen deposition in response to iron overload and a means of quickly evaluating therapeutic treatments for iron overload-induced fibrosis in vivo using iron-chelating drugs.\r"

Ursodeoxycholate was promptly secreted into bile mostly as amino acid conjugates; less than 3% was secreted in unchanged form in the rat and less than 2% in the hamster. In contrast, norursodeoxycholate was secreted slowly, and biotransformed into glucuronide conjugates and unconjugated trihydroxy derivatives; it was also secreted in part in unchanged form. In the rat, 7% was secreted in unconjugated trihydroxy derivatives and 3% in unchanged form; in the hamster, 7% was secreted as unconjugated trihydroxy derivatives and 4% in unchanged form. The secreted bile acid species that showed the highest correlation with bile flow by far was always the unconjugated form in both rat and hamster. By multiple regression analysis, the apparent choleretic activity (microliters of induced bile flow per micromoles recovered bile acid molecules) indicated marked hypercholeresis for the unconjugated bile acid marked hypercholeresis for the unconjugated bile acid with values ranging from 100 to 300 microliters/mumol. Bile flow also correlated with total bile acid recovery for ursodeoxycholate in rat and norursodeoxycholate in hamster, but in all studies the apparent choleretic activity was far lower. Other calculations indicated that most bile flow during the first 30 min was induced by secretion of the unconjugated bile acid species in all experiments, the proportion ranging from 50% to 90%. The results indicate that when a bolus of ursodeoxycholate or norursodeoxycholate is presented to the perfused rodent liver, the secretion of the unchanged bile acid appears to be responsible for most of the bile flow, probably by a cholehepatic shunting mechanism.\r"

The purpose of this report is to document which cells in the cirrhotic liver are responsible for the lactate-stimulated increase in collagen synthesis. It was found that (a) incorporation of 3H-proline into protein-bound 3H-hydroxyproline is increased threefold to fourfold in hepatocytes from CCl4-treated rats as compared with normal rat hepatocytes; (b) neither the hepatocytes from normal nor those from CCl4-treated rats modify their collagen synthesizing capacity when 30 mmol/L lactic acid was added to the incubation medium; (c) nonparenchymal cells obtained from livers of CCl4-treated rats synthesize much less collagen than hepatocytes, but their synthesis is stimulated twofold by lactic acid; (d) from the different nonparenchymal cells, only fat-storing (Ito) cells increase collagen synthesis when lactic acid is present in the incubation medium. These results suggest that the increased lactic acid levels observed in patients with alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis may play an important role in the development of fibrosis by stimulating collagen production by fat-storing (Ito) cells.\r"

  ".W": "Recent observations suggest that products of non-parenchymal liver cells such as eicosanoids and cytokines might play a role in the expression of liver injury after administration of acetaminophen and other noxious agents. We therefore investigated the effect of a fish oil diet, which results in the generation of eicosanoids with altered biological properties and suppresses the production of certain cytokines on acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Mice were fed a diet with either 20% fish oil containing n-3 fatty acids or 20% olive oil containing n-6 fatty acids for 2 wk. Cytochrome P-450 activity and the concentration of glutathione were similar in the two groups before acetaminophen administration. Nevertheless, 24 hr after the administration of 375 mg/kg acetaminophen intraperitoneally, the extent of centrilobular necrosis and the activity of ALT in plasma were significantly lower in the n-3 fatty acid group (median = 277 vs. 3,367 IU/L; p less than 0.001). In the n-3 fatty acid group covalent binding of the drug to liver proteins (0.19 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.67 +/- 0.07 nmol/mg protein; p less than 0.01) and the median plasma concentration of acetaminophen (0.1 vs. 0.6 mmol/L) were significantly lower 3 hr after dosing. Mice fed the n-3 fatty acid diet excreted less acetaminophen sulfate but significantly more acetaminophen glucuronide in 24 hr. Thus the major protective effect of the fish oil diet appears to be an increased clearance of acetaminophen resulting from a stimulation of the glucuronidation of acetaminophen, which may be due to the fluidization of microsomal membranes by fish oil.\r"

  ".W": "A new method was developed to monitor Kupffer cell phagocytosis continuously in perfused liver using a fluorescent probe, rhodamine-gelatin, synthesized from gelatin and rhodamine isothiocyanate. In perfused rat liver, phagocytosis by Kupffer cells was assessed both by uptake of the dye and from fluorescence measured from the liver surface. Uptake of rhodamine-gelatin and surface fluorescence (520----585 nm) increased as perfusate concentrations of rhodamine-gelatin were elevated. Histological examination revealed that fluorescence caused by rhodamine-gelatin was concentrated in cells lining the sinusoid. Furthermore, when hepatic parenchymal, endothelial and Kupffer cells were isolated by centrifugal elutriation after pretreatment in vivo with rhodamine-gelatin, the fluorescent label was detected nearly exclusively in the Kupffer cell fraction. Fluorescence of rhodamine-gelatin from the liver surface was directly proportional to uptake of rhodamine-gelatin, indicating that measurement of surface fluorescence could be used as an index of phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells. Uptake of rhodamine-gelatin and fluorescent labeling of sinusoidal cells were inhibited nearly completely by dextran sulfate, which decreases phagocytic activity, and were increased by about 50% by pretreatment with endotoxin, which stimulates phagocytosis. This new method was combined with standard procedures to monitor parenchymal cell function (e.g., oxygen uptake and release of lactate dehydrogenase), Kupffer cell phagocytic activity and parenchymal cell injury simultaneously during perfusion with the hepatotoxicant allyl alcohol. Activation of phagocytosis by Kupffer cells monitored by rhodamine-gelatin fluorescence occurred within 5 min of addition of allyl alcohol. On the other hand, parenchymal cell injury, assessed from release of lactate dehydrogenase, did not begin until 40 min and reached maximal values at around 90 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Trolox, a hydrophilic analog of vitamin E, was reported to scavenge peroxyl radicals from artificial systems better than its parent compound. Here we examined the possible cytoprotective effect of Trolox in cultured hepatocytes and in the rat liver. In cultured rat hepatocytes, 0.5 to 16 mmol/L Trolox (with optimum between 1 to 2 mmol/L) was observed to prolong the survival of cells exposed to oxyradicals generated with xanthine oxidase-hypoxanthine. The protection by 1 mmol/L Trolox surpassed that provided by either ascorbate, mannitol, superoxide dismutase and/or catalase--each at a level giving its maximal protection in the same system. In both a global and partial model of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion in rats, infusion of Trolox (7.5 to 10 mumol/kg body weight) just before reflow reduced by greater than 80% the liver necrosis sustained in untreated (no Trolox) control rats. Such organ salvage was apparently accompanied by approximately 50% reduction in the amount of hepatic conjugated dienes, which were quantified by a highly specific radiochemical assay. Since conjugated dienes are presumed to be good \"markers\" of oxyradical damage, our data may have provided a semiquantitative link between free radical-induced necrosis and its chemical imprint in vivo. The data also indicated a relatively rapid and potent antioxidant-like action by Trolox on rat hepatocytes and on the postischemic reperfused rat liver.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that the initial event of sodium retention in cirrhosis is a peripheral arteriolar vasodilation causing underfilling of the arterial vascular compartment and stimulation of the renin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. To test this hypothesis, systolic blood pressure, sodium balance and urinary excretion of sodium and aldosterone were sequentially measured in 13 conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats submitted to a cirrhosis induction program with carbon tetrachloride and phenobarbital and in 14 control hypertensive animals. No significant differences were found between control and cirrhotic rats in any of the measured parameters during the first 7 wk of the study. The eighth week sodium retention developed in cirrhotic rats as indicated by a positive sodium balance and a marked decrease of sodium excretion. At the same time a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure and a great increase in urinary excretion of aldosterone were detected. These changes were more marked the ninth week of the study. In cirrhotic rats there was a highly significant direct correlation between systolic blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion. Postmortem examination showed a histological picture of cirrhosis in all animals given carbon tetrachloride and ascites in six of them. These results indicate that the onset of hyperaldosteronism and sodium retention in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis is chronologically related to a significant decrease in arterial pressure, thus supporting the \"peripheral arterial vasodilation hypothesis\" of ascites.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of specific renin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, indomethacin, and prostaglandin I2 analogue on the release of angiotensins from isolated and Krebs-Ringer-perfused rabbit mesenteric arteries were examined. Three different renin inhibitors suppressed release of angiotensins in dose-dependent manners. At the highest concentration (10(-7) M), the inhibitors EMD 52,620, EMD 54,388, and EMD 52,742 induced 46%, 52%, and 48% decreases, respectively, in the basal rate of immunoreactive angiotensin II release. These results provide clear evidence that released angiotensins are produced by the specific action of vascular renin and that the renin inhibitors suppress the vascular renin-angiotensin system as well as the circulating renin-angiotensin system and appear to provide a useful mode for the treatment of hypertension. Nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors cilazapril and delapril were more effective than captopril, and ramipril was equipotent to captopril, suggesting that the effectiveness of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the vascular renin-angiotensin system cannot be explained only by its inhibitory effect on angiotensin converting enzyme. Indomethacin, which was reported to suppress angiotensin II release from rat hind limbs, elicited a dose-dependent increase of angiotensin release from rabbit mesenteric arteries. These results suggest that a difference exists in the regulatory mechanisms in the release of angiotensins from diverse vascular beds.\r"

Norepinephrine was continuously infused for 5 days into the renal artery of unilaterally nephrectomized dogs at progressively higher daily infusion rates: 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40 micrograms/kg/min. In three additional groups of dogs, norepinephrine infusion was repeated during chronic intravenous captopril administration to fix plasma Ang II concentration at 1) low levels (no Ang II infused), 2) high levels in the renal circulation (Ang II infused intrarenally at a rate of 1 ng/kg/min), and 3) high levels in the systemic circulation (Ang II infused intravenously at a rate of 5 ng/kg/min). In the control group of animals with intact renin-angiotensin systems, there were progressive increments in mean arterial pressure (from 96 +/- 4 to 141 +/- 6 mm Hg) and plasma renin activity (from 0.4 +/- 0.1 to 10.9 +/- 4.5 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr) and concomitant reductions in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow to approximately 40% of control during the 5-day norepinephrine infusion period. In marked contrast, when captopril was infused chronically without Ang II, mean arterial pressure was 20-25 mm Hg less than that under control conditions, and the renal hemodynamic effects of norepinephrine were greatly exaggerated; by day 3 of norepinephrine infusion, both glomerular filtration rate (16 +/- 2% of control) and renal plasma flow (12 +/- 4% of control) were considerably lower than values in control animals (86 +/- 4% and 80 +/- 8% of control, respectively). Similarly, when a high level of Ang II was localized in the renal circulation during captopril administration, mean arterial pressure was depressed, and again there were pronounced renal responses to norepinephrine. Conversely, when Ang II was infused intravenously during captopril administration, mean arterial pressure was not reduced, and the glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow responses to norepinephrine were similar to those that occurred under control conditions. These findings indicate that the renin-angiotensin system prevents exaggerated renal vascular responses to chronic norepinephrine stimulation by preserving renal perfusion pressure.\r"

During the baseline period, all rats exhibited comparably elevated values for mean arterial pressure and single nephron glomerular filtration rate. During the experimental infusion, control rats exhibited continued single nephron hyperfiltration (84 +/- 8 nl/min) as a result of elevations in both glomerular capillary plasma flow rate (330 +/- 36 nl/min) and glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (68 +/- 3 mm Hg), whereas the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient was low [0.050 +/- 0.009 nl/(sec.mm Hg)].

In addition, the effects of norepinephrine were assessed before and during thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor blockade by AH23848 (4 x 10(-6) M). Before drug infusion, LH kidneys differed from those of LN and LL controls by having an elevated renal vascular resistance and a decreased natriuresis and glomerular filtration rate; the urinary output of prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha, of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, and of thromboxane B2 was similar in the three strains. The constrictor effects of norepinephrine and phenylephrine were significantly increased in LH rat kidneys compared with LL but not with LN controls, and their pressure-natriuresis was markedly reduced. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine induced a 10- to 20-fold dose-dependent increase in the synthesis of the four prostanoids, which was more pronounced in LH than in LN and LL rats for thromboxane B2 only. AH23848 infusion significantly reduced the vascular effects of norepinephrine and increased the natriuretic response of LH but not of LN and LL rat kidneys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the potential role of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in mediating these differences. Vasopressin-induced increases in labeled inositol phosphates were enhanced in renomedullary interstitial cells from Dahl salt-resistant compared with those from salt-sensitive rats. Addition of neomycin reduced basal production of labeled inositol phosphates and abolished the increase in inositol phosphates induced by vasopressin. Neomycin also prevented the peak decline pattern in cytosolic Ca2+ seen with vasopressin but did not influence basal cytosolic Ca2+. In the presence of neomycin, vasopressin induced a modest but prolonged increase in cytosolic calcium. In contrast to its marked effects on inositol phosphate production, neomycin was without effect on basal or vasopressin-responsive prostaglandin E2 production. Moreover, basal and vasopressin-induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+ remained higher in renomedullary interstitial cells from Dahl salt-resistant versus those from salt-sensitive rats exposed to neomycin. The results do not support a requirement for phospholipase C-induced inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in the mediation of vasopressin actions on prostaglandin E2 production by renomedullary interstitial cells and imply that the differences in cytosolic Ca2+ and prostaglandin E2 seen in these two cell lines are not related to differences in inositol phospholipid metabolism.\r"

Treatment of hypertension was begun at 3 months of age with cilazapril (45 mg/kg/day), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or with hydralazine (18 mg/kg/day). Cilazapril and hydralazine reduced systolic arterial pressure (from 195 +/- 8 to 125 +/- 5 and 148 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively [mean +/- SEM]; p less than 0.05). To examine structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles, we measured pressure (servonull), external diameter, and cross-sectional area of the vessel wall (histologically) in pial arterioles of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHRSP that were untreated or that were treated for 3 months with cilazapril or with hydralazine. Arterioles were maximally dilated with EDTA. In WKY rats, cilazapril and hydralazine did not alter pial arteriolar pressure, external diameter, or cross-sectional area of the vessel wall. In SHRSP, both cilazapril and hydralazine reduced cross-sectional area of the vessel wall to levels not significantly different from WKY rats (from 1,911 +/- 155 to 1,244 +/- 101 and 1,388 +/- 59 microns 2, respectively, compared with 1,405 +/- 95 microns 2 for untreated WKY rats). Cilazapril was more effective than hydralazine in reducing pial arteriolar pressure (from 110 +/- 6 to 62 +/- 2 mm Hg with cilazapril versus 79 +/- 5 mm Hg for hydralazine compared with 60 +/- 4 mm Hg for untreated WKY rats). Cilazapril, but not hydralazine, attenuated reductions in external diameter of pial arterioles (from 91 +/- 4 to 100 +/- 4 microns for cilazapril versus 91 +/- 3 microns for hydralazine compared with 107 +/- 3 microns for untreated WKY rats).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pressure measurements were made at a proximal and distal site of each vessel using a servonull micropipette system. Vessel diameters were measured using video microscopy. A1 arteriole and external spermatic artery diameters were both decreased after 2 and 4 weeks of hypertension. Mean arterial pressure was elevated after 2 weeks of hypertension (106 +/- 4 mm Hg versus 140 +/- 5 mm Hg). Likewise, vascular pressures were elevated at every site: pudicepigastric artery (36%), external spermatic artery (47%), and A1 arteriole (38%). The pressure drop along the external spermatic artery was increased (87%) after 2 weeks of hypertension. Mean arterial pressure was further elevated from 2-4 weeks of hypertension (105 +/- 4 mm Hg versus 162 +/- 7 mm Hg) but only the proximal pudic-epigastric artery pressure was further elevated during this time from 2 to 4 weeks (131 +/- 5 mm Hg versus 147 +/- 7 mm Hg) of hypertension development. This was associated with an increased pressure drop (87%) along the artery compared with the situation at 2 weeks. These data indicate that small arteries upstream from the microcirculation contribute significantly to the increase in vascular resistance during hypertension. In addition, these data indicate that the increases in small artery resistance do not develop uniformly throughout all vessel branches.\r"

As an initial step toward investigating the role of leukocytes in hypertension, we measured leukocyte counts and spontaneous activation of granulocytes of freshly drawn unseparated blood samples in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in their normotensive counterpart, Wistar-Kyoto rats. The animals were derived from one breeder in the United States and from two breeders in Europe. Total leukocyte counts in young, mature, and old hypertensive rats were 50-100% above the controls. The number of granulocytes in mature and old spontaneously hypertensive rats in more than 100% elevated compared with control rats. In young hypertensive rats the mean granulocyte count was only slightly elevated. The number of spontaneously activated granulocytes, as detected by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, increases with age in both species; in mature spontaneously hypertensive rats, it is more than 300% above the values in the controls. Furthermore, in mature hypertensive rats the number of monocytes, activated monocytes, and the lymphocyte count are also significantly elevated over the values in the normotensive controls. It is proposed that these elevated leukocyte counts may constitute an enhanced risk for organ injury in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.\r"

Twenty-five patients (mean age 56 years, range 40-62 years) who had abnormal red blood cell Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport or red blood cell Li(+)-Na+ countertransport were treated with either enalapril (20 mg daily) or hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg daily) during a 30-day period. During the period of enalapril treatment, Na(+)-K+ pump and Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport increased significantly from 4,282 +/- 255 to 5,236 +/- 325 mumol/l red blood cell/hr (p less than 0.01) and 166 +/- 21 to 220 +/- 24 mumol/l red blood cell/hr (p less than 0.05), respectively. Mean intracellular Na+ content in erythrocytes decreased from 11.4 +/- 0.40 to 10.0 +/- 0.33 mmol/l (p less than 0.01) and exchangeable Na+ from 39.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/kg to 35.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/kg (p less than 0.001). Sodium reduction correlated with the recovery of Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport activity (r = -0.65, p less than 0.01). During treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced significantly (p less than 0.01). In 12 patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide, Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport, Na(+)-K+ pump, Na(+)-Li+ countertransport, and Na+ permeability did not change significantly while Na+ content decreased from 11.7 +/- 0.3 to 10.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/l (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The Na(+)-H+ antiporter activation kinetics were studied by varying cell pH and measuring net Na+ influx (mmol/l cell x hr = units) driven by an outward H+ gradient. The Na(+)-Li+ exchange was determined at pH 7.4 as sodium-stimulated Li+ efflux. Untreated hypertensive patients (n = 30) had a higher maximal rate of Na(+)-Li+ exchange (0.43 +/- 0.05 versus 0.26 +/- 0.02 units, p less than 0.0003), a higher maximal rate of Na(+)-H+ exchange (62.3 +/- 6.2 versus 47 +/- 4 units; p less than 0.02), but a similar affinity for cell pH compared with normotensive subjects (n = 46). The cell pH activation of the Na(+)-H+ antiporter exhibited a lower Hill coefficient than that of normotensive subjects (1.61 +/- 0.12 versus 2.56 +/- 0.14; p less than 0.0001). This index of occupancy of internal H+ regulatory sites was found reduced in most of the hypertensive patients (73%) whether their hypertension was untreated or treated. Hypertensive patients with Na(+)-Li+ exchange above 0.35 units (0.68 +/- 0.057 units, n = 16) did not exhibit elevated maximal rates of Na(+)-H+ exchange (57.3 +/- 10 units, NS) in comparison with those with Na(+)-Li+ exchange below 0.35 units (66.4 +/- 7.6 units, n = 26), but both groups exhibited reduced Hill coefficients.

The DS rats had slightly higher systolic blood pressures than DR rats, although a high salt diet failed to significantly elevate pressure in either group when compared with their appropriate (low salt diet) controls. The sensitivity of the isolated, perfused mesenteric vasculature from DS rats fed a high salt diet to nerve stimulation was greater when compared with all other groups in the presence or absence of cocaine (1 microM). A similar difference in sensitivity between high salt DS rats and high salt DR rats to bolus injections of norepinephrine was observed only in the presence of cocaine. The change in sensitivity was characterized by a leftward shift of the dose-response curve without a change in maximum response. No difference in sensitivity between the high salt DS group and any other treatment group was observed in response to the pressor agents KCl, angiotensin II, 5-hydroxytryptamine or the depressor agent acetylcholine. These data indicate that DS rats on a short-term, high salt diet possess a significant and specific elevation in sensitivity to nerve stimulation and norepinephrine in the absence of an increase in blood pressure. Differences in the effectiveness of cocaine among the groups suggest that differences may exist in neuronal uptake (uptake 1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the current study, the effect of dietary NaCl supplementation on arterial baroreceptor reflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate was assessed in SHR-S and control SHR-R and WKY rats. Male SHR-S, SHR-R, and WKY rats were fed diets containing either 1% or 8% NaCl beginning at 7 weeks of age and were studied at age 9-10 weeks. Arterial baroreceptor reflex-mediated changes in lumbar sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate were recorded in conscious, unrestrained rats during phenylephrine-induced (15-40 micrograms/kg/min) and nitroprusside-induced (15-300 micrograms/kg/min) changes in mean arterial pressure. SHR-S maintained on a 1% NaCl diet had blunted baroreceptor reflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity during acute increases in MAP compared with SHR-R and WKY rats (p less than 0.05). After ingestion of the 8% NaCl diet, this blunting was absent, indicating enhancement of baroreceptor reflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity. SHR-S maintained on a 1% NaCl diet also had blunted arterial baroreceptor control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity during nitroprusside-induced decreases in mean arterial pressure compared with WKY rats, but this was not significantly altered during ingestion of the 8% NaCl diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four weeks after the ascending aorta was banded, in vivo left ventricular pressure was measured to estimate the degree of pressure load. In the two age groups, similar increases in peak left ventricular pressure were observed (113 +/- 7 mm Hg in sham-operated rats versus 160 +/- 11 mm Hg in banded rats of the young adult group; 103 +/- 7 mm Hg in sham-operated rats versus 156 +/- 11 mm Hg in banded rats of the old group). After isolating the hearts, they were perfused with Tyrode's solution containing bovine red blood cells and albumin. Resting coronary perfusion pressure-flow relations and reactive hyperemic response after a 40-second ischemia were obtained under beating but nonworking conditions. In young adult banded rats, significant myocardial hypertrophy was observed at the organ level (124% of controls in left ventricular dry weight/body weight ratio; 119% in left ventricular dry weight/tibial length ratio) and at the cell level. Minimal coronary vascular resistance obtained by the perfusion pressure-peak flow relation during reactive hyperemia increased to 150% of controls, and coronary flow reserve decreased significantly. In contrast, myocardial hypertrophy was not observed at the organ or cell level in old banded rats. However, minimal coronary vascular resistance increased, and flow reserve decreased significantly. Thus, pressure overload with coronary arterial hypertension caused abnormalities of the coronary circulation in old subjects even in the absence of myocardial hypertrophy.\r"

Electrolytes were measured in diet, serum, and urine. Sodium excretion was 73.9 mmol/24 hr in high-mountain Yi farmers, 117.9 mmol/24 hr in mountainside Yi farmers, 159.4 mmol/24 hr in Yi migrants, and 186.0 mmol/24 hr in the Han people. In ecological correlation analysis, dietary and urinary sodium were significantly and positively correlated with both systolic and diastolic pressure, whereas serum sodium showed no relation with blood pressure. In diet, serum, and urine, potassium was negatively related to systolic and diastolic pressure, whereas the sodium/potassium ratio showed a positive association. With regard to calcium, only urinary excretion was significantly and positively related to blood pressure. No relation was found between magnesium and blood pressure. Analyses at the individual level confirmed the results for sodium and potassium seen at the ecological level, but in addition, dietary calcium and magnesium were significantly and negatively correlated to both systolic and diastolic pressure, and urinary magnesium was inversely related to diastolic pressure. These relations persisted after controlling for age, body mass index (kg/m2), heart rate, alcohol, and total energy intake in multiple regression analysis performed separately for electrolytes in diet, serum, and urine. In multiple regression analysis, an increase in sodium intake of 100 mmol/day corresponded to an increase of 2.3 mm Hg systolic blood pressure and 1/8 mm Hg diastolic pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

High-fidelity pressures were recorded with a multisensor catheter. Pulse wave velocity was determined between two sensors in the thoracic aorta. Arterial compliance was determined by an analysis of the diastolic waveform and cardiac output. At baseline, despite a similar systemic vascular resistance, the pulsatile load (e.g., arterial compliance) and wave transmission characteristics (e.g., pulse wave velocity) were altered with aging. Arterial compliance was reduced in older (greater than 50 yr, n = 8) versus younger (less than 35 yr, n = 8) patients (0.51 +/- 0.17 vs. 1.33 +/- 0.63 ml/mmHg, P less than 0.01) and intermediate in those 35-50 yr of age (n = 9, 0.72 +/- 0.40 ml/mmHg). There was a positive correlation between age and pulse wave velocity (r = +0.90). Nitroprusside infusion decreased resistance, increased arterial compliance, and lowered pulse wave velocity in all groups. Yet, advancing age was associated with a greater fall in wave velocity for a given fall in aortic pressure. The slope (K) of the relation between pulse wave velocity and aortic diastolic pressure progressively increased with age (0.01 +/- 0.03, 0.06 +/- 0.02, and 0.09 +/- 0.03 m/s-mmHg). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant relation between K and age. These data demonstrate that in older patients with dilated cardiomyopathy the left ventricle is coupled to an arterial circulation that has a greater pulsatile load, despite a similar steady load. Furthermore, these age-related changes in the arterial system affect the hemodynamic response to pharmacologically-induced vasodilatation.\r"

This study defines the implications of TGF beta overexpression for humoral immunity in HIV infection. We found that upon Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) stimulation of cells from HIV+ donors, B-lymphocyte proliferative responses were decreased. This deficiency correlated closely (r = 0.7, P less than 0.001) with increased TGF beta secretion by PBMC from HIV-infected donors. Conditioned medium from HIV+ PBMC and purified TGF beta 1 had similar inhibitory effects on SAC- or EBV-induced B-cell proliferation, and B cells from HIV-infected donors were as sensitive to inhibition by TGF beta as cells from normal donors. Antibodies to TGF beta 1 neutralized the inhibitory effect of HIV+ culture supernatants on normal B cells and increased low proliferative responses by HIV+ cells. Using PWM as stimulus for B cell differentiation, it was shown that activated TGF beta from HIV+ PBMC is able to significantly reduce the induction of immunoglobulins and this effect was also abrogated by anti-TGF beta. These studies support the concept that in HIV infection, TGF beta is a potent suppressor, not only of the cellular, but of the humoral immune responses as well.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin resistance, which may precede the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in Pima Indians, appears to result from a postreceptor defect in signal transduction in skeletal muscle. To identify the putative postreceptor lesion responsible for insulin resistance in Pima Indians, we investigated the influence of insulin on the activity of casein kinase II (CKII) in skeletal muscle of seven insulin-sensitive, four insulin-resistant, nondiabetic, and five insulin-resistant diabetic Pima Indians during a 2 h hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp. In sensitive subjects, CKII was transiently activated reaching a maximum over basal activity (42%) at 45 min before declining. CKII was also stimulated in resistant (19%) and diabetic (34%) subjects. Basal CKII activity in resistant subjects was 40% higher than in either sensitive or diabetic subjects, although the concentration of CKII protein, as determined by Western blotting, was equal among the three groups. Basal CKII activity was correlated with fasting plasma insulin concentrations, suggesting that the higher activity in resistant subjects resulted from insulin action. Extracts of muscle obtained from all three groups either before or after insulin administration were treated with immobilized alkaline phosphatase, which reduced and equalized CKII activity. These results suggest that insulin stimulates CKII activity in human skeletal muscle by a mechanism involving phosphorylation of either CKII or of an effector molecule, and support the idea that elevated basal activity in resistant subjects results from insulin action. It appears that the ability of insulin to activate CKII in skeletal muscle is not impaired in insulin-resistant Pima Indians, and that the biochemical lesion responsible for insulin resistance occurs either downstream from CKII or in a different pathway of insulin action.\r"

Myocardial tissue was obtained at the time of surgery or transplantation from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and was compared with control myocardium obtained from patients without heart disease. The isometric contractions and electrophysiologic properties of all myocardial specimens were recorded by standard techniques and [Ca++]i was measured with the bioluminescent calcium indicator aequorin. In contrast to the controls, action potentials, Ca++ transients, and isometric contraction and relaxation were markedly prolonged in the hypertrophic myocardium, and the Ca++ transients consisted of two distinct components. At 38 degrees C and 1 Hz pacing frequency, a state of relative Ca++ overload appeared develop, which produced a rise in end-diastolic [Ca++]i, incomplete relaxation, and fusion of twitches with a resultant decrease in active tension development. We also found that drugs with increase [Ca++]i, such as digitalis, exacerbated these abnormalities, whereas drugs that lower [Ca++]i, such as verapamil, or agents that increase cyclic AMP, such as forskolin, prevented them. These results may explain why patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy tolerate tachycardia poorly, and may have important implications with regard to the pharmacologic treatment of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r"

We therefore sought to define the relationship between mucin production by human colon cancer cells and metastatic ability by employing animal models of colon cancer metastasis. LS LiM 6, a colon carcinoma cell line with high liver metastasizing ability during cecal growth in nude mice produced twofold more metabolically labeled intracellular mucin and secreted four- to fivefold more mucin into the culture medium compared to poorly metastatic parental line LS174T. This was accompanied by a similar elevation in poly(A)+ RNA detected by blot hybridization with a human intestinal mucin cDNA probe, and increases in mucin core carbohydrate antigens determined immunohistochemically. Variants of LS174T selected for high (HM 7) or low (LM 12) mucin synthesizing capacity also yielded metastases after cecal growth and colonized the liver after splenic-portal injection in proportion to their ability to produce mucin. Inhibition of mucin glycosylation by the arylglycoside benzyl-alpha-N-acetyl-galactosamine greatly reduced liver colonization after splenic-portal injection of the tumor cells. These data suggest that mucin production by human colon cancer cells correlates with their metastatic potential and affects their ability to colonize the liver in experimental model systems.\r"

Guinea pigs immunized by aerosol with L. pneumophila membranes developed strong cell-mediated immune responses to L. pneumophila membranes as demonstrated by cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity and in vitro splenic lymphocyte proliferation. Guinea pigs immunized by aerosol or by subcutaneous inoculation with L. pneumophila membranes developed strong protective immunity against lethal aerosol challenge with L. pneumophila. Overall, in six independent experiments, 39 of 49 (80%) guinea pigs immunized with L. pneumophila membranes survived challenge compared with 2 of 40 (5%) sham-immunized controls (P = 2 x 10(-13). In contrast, guinea pigs immunized by aerosol with formalin-killed L. pneumophila did not develop either a strong cell-mediated immune response to L. pneumophila antigens or protective immunity to lethal aerosol challenge. The capacity of L. pneumophila membranes to induce protective immunity was independent of the major secretory protein of L. pneumophila, which we previously demonstrated is an immunoprotective molecule. Purified L. pneumophila membranes did not contain detectable major secretory protein (MSP) on immunoblots; immunization of guinea pigs with L. pneumophila membranes did not induce anti-MSP antibody; and guinea pigs developed comparable protective immunity after immunization with membranes from either an L. pneumophila strain that secretes the major secretory protein or an isogenic mutant that does not. This study demonstrates that (a) immunization with L. pneumophila membranes but not formalin-killed L. pneumophila induces strong cell-mediated immune responses and protective immunity, (b) L. pneumophila membranes contain immunoprotective molecules distinct from the major secretory protein of L. pneumophila, and (c) L. pneumophila membranes have potential as a vaccine against Legionnaires' disease.\r"

  ".U": "91154375\r", 
  ".W": "The increased risk of developing emphysema among individuals who smoke cigarettes and who have normal levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) is hypothesized to result from a decrease in the antineutrophil elastase capacity of the lower respiratory tract alpha 1AT of smokers compared with nonsmokers. To evaluate this hypothesis we compared the time-dependent kinetics of the inhibition of neutrophil elastase by lung alpha 1AT from healthy, young cigarette smokers (n = 8) and nonsmokers (n = 12). alpha 1-antitrypsin was purified from lavage fluid using affinity and molecular sieve chromatography, and the association rate constant (k assoc) for neutrophil elastase quantified. The k assoc of smoker plasma alpha 1AT (9.5 +/- 0.5 X 10(6) M-1s-1) was similar to that of nonsmoker plasma (9.3 +/- 0.7 X 10(6) M-1s-1, P greater than 0.5). In marked contrast, the k assoc of smoker lower respiratory tract alpha 1AT was significantly lower than that of nonsmoker alpha 1AT (6.5 +/- 0.4 X 10(6) M-1s-1 vs. 8.1 +/- 0.5 X 10(6) M-1s-1, P less than 0.01). Furthermore, the smoker lower respiratory tract alpha 1AT k assoc was significantly less than that of autologous plasma (P less than 0.01). When considered in the context of the concentration of alpha 1AT in the lower respiratory tract epithelial lining fluid, the inhibition time for neutrophil elastase of smoker lung alpha 1AT was twofold greater than that of nonsmoker lung alpha 1AT (smoker: 0.34 +/- 0.05 s vs. nonsmoker: 0.17 +/- 0.05 s, P less than 0.01). Consequently, for concentrations of alpha 1AT in the lower respiratory tract it takes twice as long for an equivalent amount of neutrophil elastase to be inhibited in the smoker's lung compared with the nonsmoker's lung. These observations support the concept that cigarette smoking is associated with a decrease in the lower respiratory tract neutrophil elastase inhibitory capacity, thus increasing the vulnerability of the lung to elastolytic destruction and thereby increasing the risk for the development of emphysema.\r"

Keratinocytes produce IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA in vitro, but only IL-1 alpha biological activity has been identified in keratinocyte cultures. In contrast, monocytes secrete biological activities attributable to both species of IL-1. Using several monoclonal antibodies to IL-1 beta, significant amounts of IL-1 beta protein could be found in keratinocyte cultures; all of this immunoreactive IL-1 beta was in the 31-kD form. This latent cytokine has been shown to bind inefficiently to the IL-1 receptor and to be (in relative terms) biologically inactive. Chymotrypsin cleaves 31-kD IL-1 beta at Tyr 113-Val 114, generating an 18-kD IL-1 species with activity equivalent to the authentic mature IL-1 beta (NH2-terminal Ala 117). Treatment of 31-kD keratinocyte IL-1 beta with chymotrypsin also generated an 18-kD molecule and significant IL-1 activity. Monocytes contain an IL-1 convertase enzyme that cleaves the IL-1 beta promolecule at Ala 117. We demonstrate here that keratinocytes do not contain such an IL-1 convertase activity, nor do they contain any activity capable of productively processing 31-kD IL-1 beta into a biologically active form. These data suggest that keratinocytes (and other non-bone marrow-derived cells) produce IL-1 beta in an inactive form that can be processed only after leaving the cell.\r"

  ".U": "91154377\r", 
  ".W": "A major portion of insulin-mediated glucose uptake occurs via the translocation of GLUT 4 glucose transporter proteins from an intracellular depot to the plasma membrane. We have examined gene expression for the GLUT 4 transporter isoform in subcutaneous adipocytes, a classic insulin target cell, to better understand molecular mechanisms causing insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and obesity. In subgroups of lean (body mass index [BMI] = 24 +/- 1) and obese (BMI = 32 +/- 2) controls and in obese NIDDM (BMI = 35 +/- 2) patients, the number of GLUT 4 glucose transporters was measured in total postnuclear and subcellular membrane fractions using specific antibodies on Western blots. Relative to lean controls, the cellular content of GLUT 4 was decreased 40% in obesity and 85% in NIDDM in total cellular membranes. In obesity, cellular depletion of GLUT 4 primarily involved low density microsomes (LDM), leaving fewer transporters available for insulin-mediated recruitment to the plasma membrane (PM). In NIDDM, loss of GLUT 4 was profound in all membrane subfractions, PM, LDM, as well as high density microsomes. These observations corresponded with decrements in maximally stimulated glucose transport rates in intact cells. To assess mechanisms responsible for depletion of GLUT 4, we quantitated levels of mRNA specifically hybridizing with human GLUT 4 cDNA on Northern blots. In obesity, GLUT 4 mRNA was decreased 36% compared with lean controls, and the level was well correlated (r = + 0.77) with the cellular content of GLUT 4 protein over a wide spectrum of body weight. GLUT 4 mRNA in adipocytes from NIDDM patients was profoundly reduced by 86% compared with lean controls and by 78% relative to their weight-matched nondiabetic counterparts (whether expressed per RNA, per cell, or for the amount of CHO-B mRNA). Interestingly, GLUT 4 mRNA levels in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (BMI = 34 +/- 4) were decreased to the same level as in overt NIDDM. We conclude that, in obesity, insulin resistance in adipocytes is due to depletion of GLUT 4 glucose transporters, and that the cellular content of GLUT 4 is determined by the level of encoding mRNA over a wide range of body weight. In NIDDM, more profound insulin resistance is caused by a further reduction in GLUT 4 mRNA and protein than is attributable to obesity per se. Suppression of GLUT 4 mRNA is observed in patients with impaired glucose tolerance, and therefore, may occur early in the evolution of diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

When stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), both secretion of uPA and the expression of its receptor are up-regulated, and these cells differentiate to an adherent phenotype. This adhesive response is markedly reduced in the presence of uPA antibodies. The PMA response is restored by the addition of native uPA, an amino-terminal fragment of uPA (residues 1-143) devoid of proteolytic activity, or a synthetic peptide (residues 12-32) from the uPA growth factor domain known to mediate receptor binding. In contrast, the addition of catalytically active low molecular weight uPA, which is missing the growth factor domain, or a peptide from the catalytic domain (residues 247-266) is ineffective. The influence of uPA antibodies on a second marker of macrophage differentiation, cysteine proteinase activity, was also examined. Cysteine proteinase activity of HL60 cells is increased in PMA-treated cells after 24 h but it fails to increase in the presence of anti-uPA. This increase in cathepsin B-like activity is also restored by exogenous uPA. These experiments indicate that an autocrine interaction of the growth factor domain of uPA with its receptor mediates an essential step in PMA-mediated myeloid cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "In addition to its classical effects on growth, growth hormone (GH) has been shown to have a number of other actions, all of which are initiated by an interaction with specific high affinity receptors present in a variety of tissues. Purification of a rabbit liver protein via its ability to bind GH has allowed the isolation of a cDNA encoding a putative human growth hormone receptor that belongs to a new class of transmembrane receptors. We have previously shown that this putative growth hormone receptor gene is genetically linked to Laron dwarfism, a rare autosomal recessive syndrome caused by target resistance to GH. Nevertheless, the inability to express the corresponding full-length coding sequence and the lack of a test for growth-promoting function have hampered a direct confirmation of its role in growth. We have now identified three nonsense mutations within this growth hormone receptor gene, lying at positions corresponding to the amino terminal extremity and causing a truncation of the molecule, thereby deleting a large portion of both the GH binding domain and the full transmembrane and intracellular domains. Three independent patients with Laron dwarfism born of consanguineous parents were homozygous for these defects. Two defects were identical and consisted of a CG to TG transition. Not only do these results confirm the growth-promoting activity of this receptor but they also suggest that CpG doublets may represent hot spots for mutations in the growth hormone receptor gene that are responsible for hereditary dwarfism.\r"

Moreover, TGF beta 1 suppressed the evolution of arthritis even when administration was begun after the acute phase of the disease. Histopathological examination of the joint revealed the systemic TGF beta 1 treatment greatly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, pannus formation, and joint erosion. Consistent with the inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment into the synovium, TGF beta 1 reversed the leukocytosis associated with the chronic phase of the arthritis. Control animals subjected to the same TGF beta 1 dosing regimen displayed no discernable immunosuppressive or toxic effects even after 4 wk of treatment. These observations not only provide insight into the immunoregulatory effects of TGF beta, but also implicate this cytokine as a potentially important therapeutic agent.\r"

However, fibroblast cultures from approximately 10% of patients with the clinical, endocrine, and genetic features characteristic of androgen resistance express normal quantities of apparently normal androgen receptor in cultured genital skin fibroblasts (receptor-positive androgen resistance). We have analyzed the androgen receptor gene of one patient (P321) with receptor-positive, complete testicular feminization and detected a single nucleotide substitution at nucleotide 2006 (G----C) within the second \"zinc finger\" of the DNA-binding domain that results in the conversion of the arginine residue at position 615 into a proline residue. Introduction of this mutation into the androgen receptor cDNA and transfection of the expression plasmid into eukaryotic cells lead to the synthesis of a receptor protein that displays normal binding kinetics but is inactive in functional assays of receptor activity. We conclude that substitution mutations in the DNA-binding domain of the androgen receptor are one cause of \"receptor-positive\" androgen resistance.\r"

Here, we examined in these cells the expression of two isoforms of glucose transporter, the erythroid (GLUT 1) and the adipose cell/muscle (GLUT 4) types, in rats aged 16 or 30 d, i.e., before and after the emergence of hyperinsulinemia. GLUT 1 protein and mRNA levels were identical in the two genotypes at both ages. In contrast, the levels of GLUT 4 protein in obese rat adipocytes were 2.4- and 4.5-fold those of lean littermates at 16 and 30 d of age, respectively, in perfect agreement with the genotype effect on insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity. The levels of GLUT 4 mRNA per fat pad were increased 2.3- and 6.2-fold in obese vs. lean rats 16- and 30-d-old, indicating a pretranslational level of regulation. The obese phenotype was not associated with overexpression of GLUT 4 mRNA in gastrocnemius muscle. This work indicates that the fa gene exerts a differential control on the expression of GLUT 1 and GLUT 4 in adipose tissue and provides evidence that independent of hyperinsulinemia, genotype is a major regulatory factor of GLUT 4 expression in this tissue.\r"

Lp(a) is distinguished from the related LDL particle by the addition of apolipoprotein(a), apo(a). The presence of this large glycoprotein is likely to affect the binding of the particle to the LDL receptor and/or other receptors which may contribute to the atherogenic potential of Lp(a). Here we demonstrate the binding to macrophages of Lp(a) and pure recombinant apo(a) protein, via a specific, high-affinity receptor. This binding could lead to foam cell formation and the localization of Lp(a) to atherosclerotic plaques.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were undertaken to investigate acquired resistance to cisplatin in human ovarian cancer cells. The cell lines A2780 and A2780/CP70 were studied to assess their respective characteristics of drug accumulation and efflux, cytosolic inactivation of drug, and DNA repair. All experiments were performed using 1-h drug exposures. The A2780/CP70 cell line was 13-fold more resistant to cisplatin than A2780 cells. When studied at their respective IC50 doses, drug accumulation rates were similar for the two cell lines. However, the resistant cell line was twofold more efficient at effluxing drug, which was associated with reduced total drug accumulation for equivalent micromolar drug exposures. At equivalent levels of total cellular drug accumulation, the two cell lines formed the same levels of cisplatin-DNA damage, suggesting that cytosolic inactivation of drug does not contribute to the differential in resistance between these cell lines. Resistant cells were also twofold more efficient at repairing cisplatin-DNA lesions in cellular DNA and in transfected plasmid DNA. We conclude that in these paired cell lines, alterations in drug uptake/efflux and in DNA repair are the major contributing factors to acquired resistance to cisplatin.\r"

  ".W": "Elevated concentrations of cytokines were found in the plasma of patients acutely ill with Reye syndrome (RS) but not in control subjects or recovered RS patients. To determine whether this disorder involves a genetically determined abnormal response to cytokines, the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 on intracellular free Ca2+ were compared in cultured skin fibroblasts from control subjects and patients with RS. IL-1 and TNF caused rapid, transient, and concentration-dependent increases in cytosolic free Ca2+. The peak cytosolic free Ca2+ was greater and occurred at higher concentrations of IL-1 and TNF in patient cells than in cells from age-matched controls. In control cells, the Ca2+ transient diminished sharply with increasing amounts of IL-1 or TNF above the maximum stimulatory concentration. In contrast, in patient fibroblast this bell-shaped curve of concentration dependency was much less apparent. Bradykinin-stimulated Ca2+ transients were similar in the two groups and did not exhibit the bell-shaped concentration dependency. Thus, plasma cytokine levels are elevated in RS patients and the Ca2+ response to cytokines is increased in cells derived from these patients. We propose that the increased response reflects a genetic defect in cytokine receptor-modulated signal transduction.\r"

  ".W": "These experiments were done to learn whether Mycoplasma pulmonis infections of the respiratory tract of rats can potentiate \"neurogenic inflammation\" and whether this potentiation is amplified by factors that exacerbate the infections. Pathogen-free F344 rats were inoculated intranasally with M. pulmonis or with sterile culture medium and then lived for 4 wk in an ammonia-free atmosphere or in air containing ammonia (100 parts per million). Neurogenic inflammation was evoked by an intravenous injection of capsaicin, and 5 min later the magnitude of the response was quantified by measuring the amount of extravasation of two tracers, Monastral blue pigment and Evans blue dye. We found that vascular permeability in the tracheas of all rats was normal in the absence of capsaicin. However, a 75-micrograms/kg dose of capsaicin, which caused almost no extravasation of Evans blue in the tracheas of pathogen-free controls (17 +/- 3 ng/mg; mean +/- SE), produced extensive extravasation in the infected rats (135 +/- 18 ng/mg; P less than 0.001). Similarly, this dose of capsaicin produced 30 times as much Monastral blue extravasation in the infected rats (area density = 47 +/- 8% of surface area) as it did in the pathogen-free rats (1.6 +/- 0.5%; P less than 0.001), a difference that resulted from increases in the number of Monastral blue-labeled postcapillary venules and in the amount of labeling per venule. Exposure of the infected rats to ammonia exacerbated the infections, further increased the number of Monastral blue-labeled vessels and the amount of labeling per vessel, and made the rats so sensitive to capsaicin that a normally tolerable dose of 150 micrograms/kg i.v. caused fatal apnea. Ammonia did not have these effects in pathogen-free rats. We conclude that M. pulmonis infections of the airway mucosa cause a potent, long-lasting potentiation of neurogenic inflammation, which results in part from an increase in the number and responsiveness of mediator-sensitive postcapillary venules. These changes can be amplified by environmental factors such as ammonia which exacerbate the infections.\r"

To investigate the role of the renal nerves in this response, 2-d-old Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to UUO or sham operation. Chemical sympathectomy was performed by injection of guanethidine, whereas, control groups received saline vehicle. At 4-5 wk, renal renin distribution was determined by immunocytochemistry, and renin mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot hybridization. Compared to the saline-treated rats with UUO, renin remained localized to the juxtaglomerular region in both kidneys of rats with UUO receiving guanethidine (P less than 0.05). Moreover, renin mRNA levels were eightfold lower in obstructed kidneys of rats receiving guanethidine than in those receiving saline. Additional groups of rats with UUO were subjected to unilateral mechanical renal denervation: renin gene expression in the obstructed kidney was suppressed by ipsilateral but not by contralateral renal denervation. These findings indicate that either chemical or mechanical denervation suppressed the increase in renin gene expression of the neonatal kidney with ipsilateral UUO. We conclude that the renal sympathetic nerves modulate renin gene expression in the developing kidney with chronic UUO.\r"

  ".W": "Strikingly selective expression patterns of beta 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 integrin subunits were revealed in endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium of fetal and adult human peripheral nerve by immunostaining with specific antibodies. The alpha 2 subunit was expressed only on Schwann cells both in fetal and adult nerve, whereas the alpha 3 epitopes were expressed exclusively in the adult tissue and were primarily present on perineurial cells. The alpha 5 epitopes were expressed only on the innermost cell layer of perineurium of fetal and adult nerve. The tumor cells within schwannomas and cutaneous neurofibromas expressed both alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits, indicating that Schwann cells have the potential to express also the alpha 3 subunit in vivo. Cell cultures established from human fetal nerve and neurofibromas revealed expression of the alpha 2 and alpha 5 epitopes on Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and fibroblasts, whereas only Schwann cells contained the alpha 3 epitopes which were occasionally concentrated on the adjacent Schwann cells at cell-cell contacts. Our findings emphasize that nerve connective tissue cells change their profiles for expression of extracellular matrix receptors under conditions which have different regulatory control signals exerted by, for example, axons, humoral factors, or the extracellular matrix of the peripheral nerve. This plasticity may play an important role during nerve development and in neoplastic processes affecting the connective tissue compartments of peripheral nerve.\r"

  ".W": "Imipramine is the prototypic tricyclic antidepressant utilized in the treatment of major depression and exerts its therapeutic efficacy only after prolonged administration. We report a study of the effects of short-term (2 wk) and long-term (8 wk) administration of imipramine on the expression of central nervous system genes among those thought to be dysregulated in imipramine-responsive major depression. As assessed by in situ hybridization, 8 wk of daily imipramine treatment (5 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats decreased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA levels by 37% in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA levels by 40% in the locus coeruleus (LC). These changes were associated with a 70% increase in mRNA levels of the hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR, type I) that is thought to play an important role in mediating the negative feedback effects of low levels of steroids on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Imipramine also decreased proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA levels by 38% and glucocorticoid receptor (GR, type II) mRNA levels by 51% in the anterior pituitary. With the exception of a 20% decrease in TH mRNA in the LC after 2 wk of imipramine administration, none of these changes in gene expression were evident as a consequence of short-term administration of the drug. In the light of data that major depression is associated with an activation of brain CRH and LC-NE systems, the time-dependent effect of long-term imipramine administration on decreasing the gene expression of CRH in the hypothalamus and TH in the LC may be relevant to the therapeutic efficacy of this agent in depression.\r"

Incubation of blasts from three patients with AML in serum-free medium with TNF (10(3) U/ml), and subsequent binding studies using 125I-G-CSF reveal that TNF downregulates the numbers of G-CSF receptors by approximately 70%. G-CSF receptor numbers on purified blood granulocytes are also downmodulated by TNF. Downregulation of G-CSF receptor expression becomes evident within 10 min after incubation of the cells with TNF at 37 degrees C and is not associated with an apparent change of the dissociation constant (Kd). The TNF effect does not occur at 0 degrees C and cannot be induced by IL-2, IL-6, or GM-CSF. TNF probably exerts its effect through activation of protein kinase C (PKC) as the TNF effect on G-CSF receptor levels can be mimicked by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate. The PKC inhibitor Staurosporine (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as well as protease inhibitors can completely prevent G-CSF receptor downmodulation. Thus, it appears TNF may act as a regulator of G-CSF receptor expression in myeloid cells and shut off G-CSF dependent hematopoiesis. The regulatory ability of TNF may explain the antagonism between TNF and G-CSF stimulation.\r"

We investigated whether mesangial of mesangial proliferative nephritis induced with antibody to the Thy-1 antigen present on mesangial cells. At day 3 glomeruli displayed de novo immunostaining for alpha-smooth muscle actin in a mesangial pattern, correlating with the onset of proliferation, and persisting until day 14. An increase in desmin and vimentin in mesangial regions was also noted. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that the actin-positive cells were mesangial cells, and double immunolabeling demonstrated that the smooth muscle actin-positive cells were actively proliferating. Northern analysis of isolated glomerular RNA confirmed an increase in alpha and beta/gamma actin mRNA at days 3 and 5. Complement depletion or platelet depletion prevented or reduced proliferation, respectively; these maneuvers also prevented smooth muscle actin and actin gene expression. Studies of five other experimental models of nephritis confirmed that smooth muscle actin expression is a marker for mesangial cell injury. Thus, mesangial cell proliferation in glomerulonephritis in the rat is associated with a distinct phenotypic change in which mesangial cell assume smooth muscle cell characteristics.\r"

We describe here a CPT II deficiency associating hypoketotic hypoglycemia, high plasma creatine kinase level, heart beat disorders, and sudden death in a 3-mo-old boy. CPT II defect (-90%) diagnosed in fibroblasts is qualitatively similar to that (-75%) of two \"classical\" CPT II-deficient patients previously studied: It resulted from a decreased amount of CPT II probably arising from its reduced biosynthesis. Consequences of CPT II deficiency studied in fibroblasts differed in both sets of patients. An impaired oxidation of long-chain fatty acids was found in the proband but not in patients with the \"classical\" form of the deficiency. The metabolic and clinical consequences of CPT II deficiency might depend, in part, on the magnitude of residual CPT II activity. With 25% residual activity CPT II would become rate limiting in skeletal muscle but not in liver, heart, and fibroblasts. As observed in the patient described herein, CPT II activity ought to be more reduced to induce an impaired oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in these tissues.\r"

Intravenous infusion of the cholecystokinin analogue caerulein results in highly correlated apical secretion of digestive and lysosomal enzymes, suggesting that they are discharged from the same presecretory compartment (zymogen granules). Lysosomal enzymes appear to enter that compartment as a result of missorting. After 7 h of duct obstruction is relieved, caerulein-stimulated apical secretion of cathepsin B and amylase is increased, but the ratio of cathepsin B to amylase secretion is not different than that following caerulein stimulation of animals never obstructed. These findings indicate that duct obstruction causes an increased amount of both lysosomal and digestive enzymes to accumulate within the secretagogue releasable compartment but that duct obstruction does not increase the degree of lysosomal enzyme missorting into that compartment. Pancreatic duct obstruction causes lysosomal hydrolases to become colocalized with digestive enzymes in organelles that, in size and distribution, resemble zymogen granules but that are not subject to secretion in response to secretagogue stimulation. These organelles may be of importance in the development of pancreatitis.\r"

  ".U": "91154403\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined the expression and secretion of endogenous parathyroid hormone-like peptide (PLP) in primary cultures of normal human keratinocytes. In response to growth factors and fetal bovine serum, PLP mRNA expression and immunoreactive PLP release into conditioned medium was rapidly increased (within hours) whereas these effects were inhibited by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. These early responses were not influenced by raising the medium calcium concentration from 0.15 to 1.0 mM. In contrast, increasing the medium calcium concentration to 1.0 mM, addition of 1,25(OH)2D3, or a combination of both, resulted in a delayed augmentation (after several days) in PLP production which was associated with an increase in cellular differentiation as assessed by production of high molecular weight keratin. To investigate whether these factors were acting at the level of transcription of the PLP gene, a series of vectors were prepared by fusing segments of the 5' flanking region of the rat PLP gene to a growth hormone reporter gene. Transient transfection of these constructs into cultured keratinocytes and measurement of immunoreactive growth hormone in the medium showed that a region stimulated by growth factors is located in a 1.9-kb fragment of the 5' flanking region and that a PLP gene promoter region less than 1.2 kb and greater than 0.3 kb upstream of the cap site contains cis-acting elements which respond positively to serum, and negatively to 1,25(OH)2D3. These combined studies demonstrate that, in normal human keratinocytes, growth factors may acutely stimulate PLP mRNA levels and PLP release, whereas 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits these responses. At least part of these effects are at the level of gene transcription. Additionally, PLP synthesis and release are enhanced under conditions in which keratinocyte differentiation is induced.\r"

  ".W": "The inflammatory lesions associated with Helicobacter pylori gastritis and duodenitis contain large numbers of mononuclear cells. The close proximity of H. pylori to gastric mucosa suggests that the organism interacts with mononuclear cells, thereby modulating the inflammatory response. To investigate the role of monocytes/macrophages in this response, we examined the effect of whole H. pylori bacteria, H. pylori surface proteins, and H. pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on purified human monocytes. Whole H. pylori and the extracted LPS induced expression of the monocyte surface antigen HLA-DR and interleukin-2 receptors, production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor (peptide and messenger RNA), and secretion of the reactive oxygen intermediate superoxide anion. Since H. pylori in vivo does not invade mucosal tissue, we determined whether soluble constituents of the bacteria could activate monocytes. Soluble H. pylori surface proteins, which are enriched for urease and do not contain LPS, stimulated phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional changes consistent with highly activated monocytes. These findings indicate that H. pylori is capable of activating human monocytes by an LPS-independent as well as an LPS-dependent mechanism. H. pylori activation of resident lamina propria macrophages and monocytes trafficking through the mucosa, leading to the secretion of increased amounts of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen intermediates, could play an important role in mediating the inflammatory response associated with H. pylori gastritis and duodenitis.\r"

The mechanisms by which they tolerate low levels of oxygen are unknown, but may parallel the response to other cellular stresses, such as heat shock. After 4-8 h of hypoxia, we found a decrease in total protein synthesis in both cultured bovine aortic and pulmonary arterial EC. SDS-PAGE and autoradiographic analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins demonstrated the concomitant induction of a specific set of proteins (Mr 34, 36, 47, and 56 kD) in both cell types. These hypoxia-associated proteins (HAPs) were cell-associated and up-regulated in a time- and oxygen concentration-dependent manner. Comparison of these proteins with heat shock proteins (HSPs) demonstrated that HAPs were distinct from HSPs. EC maintained chronically in 3% O2 continued to synthesize elevated levels of HAPs, yet further up-regulated these proteins when exposed to 0% O2. The presence of five times the normal media glucose concentration did not alter the appearance of HAPs. Hypoxia sensitive renal tubular epithelial cells up-regulated no proteins corresponding to HAPs and were irreversibly damaged within 8 h of exposure to 0% O2. In vitro translation experiments demonstrated that the steady-state level of several mRNAs was higher in the anoxic EC than in normoxic EC and encoded for proteins of Mr 32, 35, 37, 40, and 48 kD that were different from proteins encoded by HSP mRNAs. The induction of HAPs during acute hypoxia and their continued synthesis in chronic hypoxia suggest that HAPs may be important in the maintenance of endothelial cell integrity under conditions of decreased ambient oxygen.\r"

The mut and cbl forms are classically differentiated by somatic cell complementation. We describe a novel method for differential diagnosis of mut and cbl methylmalonic aciduria using DNA-mediated gene transfer of a methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA clone. Gene transfer of a functional methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA clone into mut fibroblasts reconstitutes holoenzyme activity measured by metabolism of [14C]-propionate in culture. Identical gene transfers into cbl fibroblasts have no effect. This method is used for the differential diagnosis of mut and cbl genotypes in cells from patients with a clinical diagnosis of methylmalonic aciduria and is shown to be a facile, sensitive, and specific method for genetic diagnosis. This work establishes the principle of using DNA-mediated gene transfer to identify the genotype of diseases which can result from mutations at several different genetic loci. This type of differential genotypic diagnosis will be particularly important for establishing the applicability of somatic gene therapy in individual patients.\r"

Surface expression of GMP-140 in stimulated platelets, assessed by flow cytometric measurements of the binding of two anti-GMP-140 monoclonal antibodies, was 24-38% of normal values in platelets from patient J.C., vs. 60-95% of normal values in family C. Total platelet content of GMP-140, determined in platelet lysates by antigen-capture ELISA, was 49% of normal in patient J.C., but normal in the members of family C. Platelets of patient J.C. were found to be heterogeneous with respect to GMP-140 content and surface expression by both flow cytometry and immunogold electron microscopy. Approximately 80% of her platelets expressed little or no GMP-140 after stimulation, whereas the remaining 20% expressed normal amounts of GMP-140 and showed extensive immunogold labeling of typical alpha-granules and clear vacuoles. No such heterogeneity was found in platelets from family C. These findings in the severe alpha delta-SPD patient are in clear contrast to the observations of normal GMP-140 content in the three other alpha delta-SPD patients, and in patients with the gray platelet syndrome, reported previously by others. These results illustrate the phenotypic heterogeneity of alpha-granule deficiencies in human platelets, and suggest that a defect in granule formation in the megakaryocytes may account for the alpha-granule defect in at least one form of alpha delta-SPD.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the relationship between net hepatic glucose uptake (NHGU) and the insulin level and to determine the effects of portal glucose delivery on that relationship, NHGU was evaluated at three different insulin levels in seven 42-h-fasted, conscious dogs during peripheral glucose delivery and during a combination of peripheral and portal glucose delivery. During peripheral glucose delivery, at arterial blood glucose levels of approximately 175 mg/dl and insulin levels reaching the liver of 51 +/- 2, 92 +/- 6, and 191 +/- 6 microU/ml, respectively, NHGUs were 0.55 +/- 0.30, 1.52 +/- 0.44, and 3.04 +/- 0.79 mg/kg per min, respectively. At hepatic glucose loads comparable to those achieved during peripheral glucose delivery and inflowing insulin levels of 50 +/- 4, 96 +/- 5, and 170 +/- 8 microU per ml, respectively, NHGUs were 1.96 +/- 0.48, 3.67 +/- 0.68, and 5.52 +/- 0.92 mg/kg per min when a portion of the glucose load was delivered directly into the portal vein. The results of these studies thus indicate that net hepatic glucose uptake is dependent on both the plasma insulin level and the route of glucose delivery and that under physiological conditions the \"portal\" signal is at least as important as insulin in the determination of net hepatic glucose uptake.\r"

  ".U": "91154410\r", 
  ".W": "The immunosuppressive drug, mizoribine, has been used to prevent rejection of organ allografts in humans and in animal models. Based on studies in cell lines, mizoribine has been postulated to be an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (EC1.2.1.14), a pivotal enzyme in the formation of guanine ribonucleotides from IMP. To further characterize the mechanism of action of this drug, we studied the effect of mizoribine on human peripheral blood T cells stimulated with alloantigen, anti-CD3 MAb, or pharmacologic mitogens. Mizoribine (1-50 micrograms/ml) was able to inhibit T cell proliferation by 10-100% in a dose-dependent fashion to all stimuli tested. Measurements of purine ribonucleotide pools by HPLC showed that mizoribine led to a decrease in intracellular GTP levels, and that repletion of GTP reversed its antiproliferative effects. We also examined sequential events occurring after T cell stimulation. Early events in T cell activation, as assessed by steady-state mRNA levels of c-myc, IL-2, c-myb, histone, and cdc2 kinase, as well as surface IL-2 receptor expression, were unaffected. However, cell cycle analysis revealed decreased numbers of cells in S, G2, and M phases, and showed that the G1/S block was reversed with GTP repletion. These data indicate that mizoribine has an effect on T cell proliferation by a mechanism distinct from that of cyclosporine or corticosteroids, and therefore may be useful in combination immunosuppressive regimens.\r"

Both cytokines were identified in acute and chronic active MS lesions but were absent from chronic silent lesions. LT was associated with CD3+ lymphocytes and Leu-M5+ microglia cells at the lesion edge and to a lesser extent, in adjacent white matter. TNF was associated with astrocytes in all areas of the lesion, and with foamy macrophages in the center of the active lesion. In acute lesions, immunoreactivity for TNF in endothelial cells was noted at the lesion edge. No LT or TNF reactivity was detected in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease brain tissues but was present at lower levels in central nervous system (CNS) tissue from other inflammatory conditions, except for adrenoleucodystrophy which displayed high levels of LT in microglia. No increase in LT and TNF reactivity was detected in spleen and PBMC of MS patients suggesting specific reactivity within the CNS. These results indicate that LT and TNF may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of MS, and can be detected in both inflammatory cells and cells endogenous to the CNS.\r"

PMN from some JP patients exhibit abnormal chemotactic responsiveness when challenged with the synthetic formyl peptide, FMLP. While investigating PMN function in JP, we found a patient in whom abnormal PMN chemotactic responses to FMLP were associated with a defective population of PMN formyl peptide receptor(s) (FPR). JP PMN failed to respond chemotactically when challenged with FMLP, but exhibited normal chemotactic responses upon exposure to purified human C5a. Furthermore, JP PMN were capable of degranulating and generating superoxide anion radicals as well as normal PMN upon exposure to FMLP. Binding studies demonstrated that JP PMN had a diminution in the number of high-affinity FPR. Studies in which FPR was radiolabeled by chemical cross-linking demonstrated that JP PMN FPR exhibited the same molecular weight and N-linked glycosylation as normal PMN FPR. JP PMN FPR, however, was more resistant to papain cleavage than normal PMN FPR. Autoradiograms obtained from 2D-PAGE of normal and JP PMN FPR demonstrated decreased amounts of FPR isoforms in JP PMN.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, we have established a human squamous cell carcinoma of the maxilla (called MH-85) associated with hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, and cachexia in culture. MH-85 tumor cells caused the same paraneoplastic syndromes in tumor-bearing nude mice. We found that there was a sixfold increase in splenic size in MH-85 tumor-bearing mice. This increase paralleled tumor growth and was reversed by surgical removal of the tumor. Splenectomy in nude mice 1 wk before or 6 wk after tumor inoculation resulted in a decrease in tumor growth, and impairment of hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, and cachexia. In MH-85 tumor-bearing animals that had been pretreated by splenectomy, intravenous injection of fresh normal spleen cells caused an immediate reversal of leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, and cachexia. Since the presence of cachexia in both the patient and the mice carrying the tumor suggested tumor necrosis factor (TNF) may be overproduced, we injected polyclonal neutralizing antibodies raised against murine TNF into tumor-bearing mice. There was a rapid and reproducible decrease in blood ionized calcium, accompanied by suppression of osteoclast activity. No changes in blood ionized calcium were seen in mice injected with normal immune sera. In addition, there was an increase in body weight and decrease in white cell count. Plasma immunoreactive TNF was increased almost fourfold in tumor-bearing nude mice compared with control nude mice. Although TNF activity was undetectable in MH-85 culture supernatants, cells of the macrophage lineage, including spleen cells, released increased amounts of TNF when cultured with MH-85 tumor-conditioned media. These results suggest that splenic cytokines such as TNF may influence the development of the paraneoplastic syndromes of hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, and cachexia in these animals, as well as tumor growth. They also show that paraneoplastic syndromes may be due to factors produced by normal host cells stimulated by the presence of the tumor.\r"

Moreover, indications as to the in vivo relevance of in vitro effects were obtained. G-CSF and GM-CSF induced endothelial cells to proliferate and migrate. In contrast, unlike appropriate reference cytokines (IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor, IFN-gamma), G-CSF and GM-CSF did not modulate endothelial cell functions related to hemostasis-thrombosis (production of procoagulant activity and of platelet activating factor), inflammation (expression of leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and production of platelet activating factor), and accessory function (expression of class II antigens of MHC). Other colony-stimulating factors (IL-3 and macrophage-colony-stimulating factor) were inactive on all functions tested. In comparison to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), G-CSF and GM-CSF induced lower maximal proliferation of endothelial cells, whereas migration was of the same order of magnitude. G-CSF and GM-CSF stimulated repair of mechanically wounded endothelial monolayers. Exposure to both cytokines induced shape changes and cytoskeletal reorganization consistent with a migratory phenotype. To explore the in vivo relevance of the in vitro effects of these cytokines on endothelium, we studied the angiogenic activity of human G-CSF in the rabbit cornea. G-CSF, but not the heat-inactivated molecule, had definite angiogenic activity, without any sign of inflammatory reactions. G-CSF was less active than bFGF. However, the combination of a nonangiogenic dose of bFGF with G-CSF resulted in an angiogenic response higher than that elicited by either individual cytokines. Thus, G-CSF and GM-CSF induce endothelial cells to express an activation/differentiation program (including proliferation and migration) related to angiogenesis.\r"

In recent years application of newer technologies has contributed substantially to an overall understanding of this collection of inherited diseases. Concurrently, many new phenotypes have been recognized, in part the result of ongoing prospective patient registries in the United States and abroad. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a massive literature that may appear to be confounded by seemingly excessive or arbitrary subdivision of epidermolysis bullosa variants. With these concerns in mind a subcommittee was established by the National Epidermolysis Bullosa Registry to summarize the current literature and to make recommendations as to the best clinical and laboratory criteria for the practical diagnosis and subclassification of patients with inherited epidermolysis bullosa.\r"

Therefore we have attempted to clarify the nosologic position of acute hemorrhagic edema among cutaneous vasculitides in children, on the basis of our experience in 10 cases. Our study confirms that acute hemorrhagic edema affects infants between 4 and 24 months of age. The two main features are an ecchymotic purpura, often in a cockade pattern, and an inflammatory edema of the limbs and face. Visceral involvement is uncommon. Spontaneous and complete resolution occurs within 1 to 3 weeks; one to four attacks may occur. Histopathologic examination demonstrates a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Perivascular IgA deposits can occasionally be found. Besides typical acute hemorrhagic edema, some cases in 2- to 4-year-old children appear to overlap with Schonlein-Henoch purpura. We suggest that typical acute hemorrhagic edema should be regarded as a separate clinical entity. This allows an appropriate prognosis to be made for this generally benign disease of infants.\r"

In rare cases, the virus has also been isolated in cultures of skin biopsy specimens of erythema multiforme. To investigate further the association between erythema multiforme and herpes simplex virus, we used the polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus to examine skin lesions from patients with erythema multiforme. In this study herpes simplex virus DNA was detected in 11 of 31 biopsy specimens of erythema multiforme; six additional cases showed equivocal amplification results, which is suggestive of low amounts of viral DNA. Seven skin and mucosal biopsy specimens with the histologic changes of herpes virus infection served as positive controls: all were positive for herpes simplex virus DNA. Viral DNA was not detected in control biopsy specimens from skin excised for unrelated conditions. These studies support the association of herpes simplex virus in the pathogenesis of some cases of erythema multiforme. The polymerase chain reaction provides a quick and effective method of detecting herpes simplex virus in lesions of herpes-associated erythema multiforme. Furthermore, the polymerase chain reaction may delineate those cases of erythema multiforme that are etiologically related to herpes virus infection and therefore might be treated with acyclovir to prevent recurrence.\r"

Only recently has the Histiocyte Society established a criterion for a \"definitive diagnosis\" of Langerhans cell histiocytosis--the presence of Birbeck granules within the cells of the histiocytic infiltrate. We report the fatal outcome of Langerhans cell histiocytosis in monozygotic twin infants. There is no satisfactory explanation why Langerhans cell histiocytosis occurs concurrently in twins. We suggest that cytokines may provide an endogenous signal that triggers the pathologic proliferation of Langerhans cells.\r"

Most theories involve environmental factors, but supportive experimental data are scarce. Therefore we studied the in vitro nail changes produced by several organic solvents, detergents, water, other polar materials, and both acidic and basic solutions. Challenged and control fingernail clippings were examined grossly, microscopically, and by scanning electron microscopy at regular intervals. There was a progressive increase in severity with prolonged wetting and drying. By 3 weeks, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated unattached individual cells in empty spaces in which separation was more prominent. Basic solutions caused some softening, but layering (peeling) was seen only after repeated hydration and dehydration. Although other factors may influence onychoschizia, the typical changes can be produced in normal nails after a 21-day challenge of repeated exposure to water followed by dehydration. These findings suggest a probable cause for the condition and a logical approach to management.\r"

Livedo reticularis, recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis, ischemic complications with gangrene, leg ulcers, or ulcers on the toes were other manifestations. Urticaria occurred in two patients, and Raynaud's phenomenon and necrotizing vasculitis were each observed in one patient. Platelet function may be abnormal, and this was found in 13 of 19 patients studied, 9 of whom had spontaneous platelet aggregation. Knowledge of the cutaneous manifestations in essential thrombocythemia may lead to its earlier detection.

In contrast, a negative round fingerpad sign was seen in 240 of 240 fingers in normal women (controls). The high sensitivity of this sign is noteworthy. A positive round fingerpad was seen in sign not only typical scleroderma patients but also in groups with less severe skin sclerosis (i.e., in those patients with mixed connective tissue disease or those with Raynaud's phenomenon and sclerodactyly).

Two skin biopsy specimens were obtained from each person, one from previously ultraviolet light-irradiated skin and another one from unirradiated skin. An epidermal cell suspension, skin homogenate, or both were prepared from each specimen. Autologous cultures were made with peripheral blood mononuclear cells combined with irradiated or unirradiated skin homogenate and peripheral blood mononuclear cells combined with irradiated or unirradiated epidermal cell suspension. Cell proliferation was assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. The response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to unirradiated epidermal cells or unirradiated skin homogenate was similar in both patients and controls. However, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with polymorphous light eruption showed a significantly increased proliferative response to both irradiated epidermal cells and irradiated skin homogenate. Our results indicate that ultraviolet light increases the stimulatory capability of polymorphous light eruption epidermal cells in a unidirectional mixed culture with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This suggests that an immune sensitization against autologous ultraviolet light-modified skin antigens occurs in polymorphous light eruption.\r"

During the past 2 years we have treated seven patients who had pyoderma gangrenosum with cyclosporine after their condition proved resistant to conventional therapy. No evidence of permanent toxicity from cyclosporine was detected and treatment with other immunosuppressive agents was discontinued in five of seven cases. Tuberculosis was reactivated in one patient. Three patients had a remission, three had an intermediate response, and one did not respond. These results indicate that cyclosporine is useful in the treatment of patients with refractory pyoderma gangrenosum and suggest an immune mechanism in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\r"

Langerhans cells in close contact with early degenerating keratinocytes could be observed in the epidermis. To study the cellular composition of the epidermal inflammatory infiltrate immunohistochemistry was performed. These studies demonstrated that the predominant cell type in these infiltrates are helper T cells, intermingled with Leu-6+ Langerhans cells. Despite the clinical variation and possible different etiologic or triggering mechanisms, the immunohistochemical and morphologic changes in all types of porokeratosis are the same and seem to represent a uniform reaction pattern.\r"

Treatment with penicillin and surgical drainage was successful. Bacterial infections associated with defective humoral immunity appear to be common in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and some of these infections have a remarkable extensive and lethal evolution.
