  ".W": "The records of 56 consecutive patients, age 70 years or older, who were operated on for mechanical small bowel obstruction were reviewed to determine the effect of early operation versus delayed operation. Delayed operation was defined as a laparotomy performed more than 48 hours after admission. Excluding the 13 patients with hernias, there were no significant differences between the early operation and delayed operation groups in regard to age, cause of small bowel obstruction, duration of prehospitalization symptoms, degree of underlying disease, or physical findings on presentation--with the exception of a significantly higher number of patients in the early operation group who had abdominal tenderness. There were no differences between mortality and small bowel infarction rates in the two groups. There was an increase in the complication rate (60 vs 24%, P less than .05) and the mean length of stay (29.6 vs 20.0 days, P less than 0.05) in the delayed operation group. This increased mean length of stay was directly related to the higher number of complications caused by delay in operation. Advanced age in a patient with complete small bowel obstruction should not stay the surgeon's hand because delay only leads to a prohibitive increase in complications and length of hospitalization.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports claim a beneficial role for SMS201-995 (SMS) in pancreatitis. To study the effects of SMS in a canine pancreatitis model, four groups of eight dogs each were subjected to laparotomy; and after cannulation of the dorsal pancreatic duct, a mixture of bile and trypsin was infused to induce pancreatitis. Group I constituted the control group and received no SMS. Group II received SMS intravenously at 5 micrograms/hr beginning 1 hour before the induction of pancreatitis. Group III and Group IV received SMS at the same dose starting at 2 hours and 6 hours, respectively, after the induction of pancreatitis. Infusions were maintained until 24 hours after the induction of pancreatitis. Leukocyte counts, serum lipase and amylase levels were obtained preoperatively and at 24 hours. All dogs were killed at 24 hours and autopsies performed. At autopsy, severity of pancreatitis was graded, based on survival, the presence or absence of pancreatic edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis, as well as the presence and severity of bloody ascites. Only on a dog (Group III) died before the 24-hour period. When SMS was used before the induction of pancreatitis, the pancreatitis seen was less severe (Group I vs Group II, P = .022). No effects were found when using SMS after the induction of pancreatitis (Group III or Group IV vs Group I). The serum lipase, amylase, and leukocyte counts changed significantly in all the dogs (P less than .001) with the onset of pancreatitis, but this difference was not significant between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An increasingly important subset of patients with biliary tract disease are those with acute cholecystitis. The indications for both routine or selective intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) during elective cholecystectomy may not be appropriate for this group. The utility of IOC in the presence of acute cholecystitis was examined. The medical records of 223 patients with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis were reviewed. Clinical and laboratory criteria included age, sex, white blood cell count (WBC), serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. In 52 (23%) patients, IOC was not attempted and was technically unsuccessful in 15 (7%) patients. IOC was successful in 156 (70%) patients and, of these, six (4%) had a false-positive examination. The remainder are divided into two groups. Group 1 (131 patients) had true-negative IOC, whereas Group 2 (19 patients) had true-positive IOC as evidenced by stone recovery upon surgical exploration. When comparing Group 2 with Group 1, the mean preoperative laboratory values are higher; these differences do not reach statistical significance. Further, within Group 2, five (26%) patients did not demonstrate any clinical or laboratory elevations suggestive of common duct pathology. Thus, in acute cholecystitis, laboratory criteria do not appear to discriminate between the presence or absence of choledocholithiasis. IOC is advocated as an integral component of the operative procedure.\r"

  ".W": "In four patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms increased intra-abdominal pressure developed after repair. It was manifested by increased ventilatory pressure, increased central venous pressure, and decreased urinary output associated with massive abdominal distension not due to bleeding. This set of findings constitutes an intra-abdominal compartment syndrome caused by massive interstitial and retroperitoneal swelling. The purpose of this report is to establish criteria for this syndrome and suggest a method of treatment. The syndrome developed within 24 hours; in one patient within 5 hours postoperatively. All four patients received more than 25 liters of fluid resuscitation (electrolyte and blood) during and within 16 hours after operation and had massive abdominal distension. Decompressive laparotomies were performed in the Intensive Care Unit with placement of Marlex (Bard Corp., Billerica, MA) mesh. In two additional patients, at the completion of the aneurysmectomy the abdominal incision was left open with interposition Marlex mesh. Opening the abdominal incision was associated with dramatic improvements in central venous pressure, urinary output, ventilatory pressure, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and oxygenation. The authors conclude that some patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm do not tolerate the closure of the abdominal wall, as manifested by increased ventilatory pressures, decreased oxygenation, and decreased urinary output. Opening the abdominal wound or delayed closure may reverse the oliguria and improve oxygenation. Recognition and treatment of this condition by opening the abdominal wound or delayed closure may affect outcome in some cases.\r"

DESIGN: A case series of patients with chronic diarrhea and case-control and cohort studies to determine the vehicle and cause of the illness. SETTING: Rural Henderson County, Illinois. PATIENTS: Seventy-two patients who had onset of chronic diarrheal illness between May and August 1987. Controls were local residents and eating companions who did not have diarrheal illness. A cohort study included 80 truck drivers from a local firm. METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS: Nonbloody diarrhea was characterized by extreme frequency (median, 12 stools/d), marked urgency, fecal incontinence, and weight loss (mean, 4.5 kg). The median incubation period was 10 days. Nine patients were hospitalized; none died. Diarrhea persisted in 87% of patients after 6 months. Antimicrobial therapy produced no clinical improvement. No bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, or parasitic agents known to be enteropathogenic were detected in stools or implicated water. Three of five small-bowel biopsies showed mild inflammatory changes. Mild inflammation was also seen in two of nine colonic biopsies. Case-control studies implicated a local restaurant (P = 0.0001, odds ratio = 19) and subsequently the untreated well water served in the restaurant (P = 0.04, odds ratio = 9.3) as the vehicle of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first outbreak of chronic diarrhea linked to drinking untreated water. The causative agent and pathophysiologic mechanism of the illness remain elusive.\r"

The duration of disease, metabolic control, and type of diabetes mellitus, the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy, and evidence of systemic vegetative neuropathy were considered. It was found that sympathetic denervation was related significantly to the duration of disease and to the development of systemic autonomic neuropathy. There were also signs of iris myopathy in the pupil alterations of long-standing diabetics, explaining the poor pupil responsiveness to mydriatics occasionally found in these patients. Pupillary autonomic diabetic neuropathy should be considered an early and major sign of the development of systemic vegetative diabetic disease.\r"

The difference between complete and incomplete posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) between the control and pathologic groups was statistically significant (P less than .0005). This shows that incomplete PVD is related to macular edema. The difference between complete and incomplete PVD and diffuse or cystoid macular edema was not statistically significant. It was significant between incomplete PVD without collapse and with contraction and diffuse and cystoid macular edema (P less than .0005). That is cystoid macular edema is associated with incomplete PVD with vitreous contraction. The vitreous usually collapses with laser treatment. Complete PVD before treatment seems to be associated with a good prognosis after photocoagulation. Cases with incomplete PVD and cystoid macular edema show worsening of the visual field after laser treatment.\r"

Bivariate analysis demonstrated that total spiral ganglion cell count tended to be lower in older than in younger deaf individuals and lower with longer duration of hearing loss and total deafness. However, multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the cause of hearing loss was the single most significant determinant of total spiral ganglion cell count. Patients with deafness due to aminoglycoside toxicity or sudden idiopathic deafness had the highest residual spiral ganglion cell count and patients with deafness due to presumptive postnatal viral labyrinthitis, bacterial labyrinthitis, and congenital or genetic causes had the lowest numbers of residual spiral ganglion cells.\r"

In 51 laryngectomy specimens removed for squamous cell cancer and showing foramina, tumor was not observed to invade or traverse the foramen in a single case, even in those specimens with tumor overlying the foramen and displaying framework invasion at other sites. Invasion by cancer through the foramen appears to be prevented by a layer of fibroelastic tissue overlying the medial surface of the foramen, parallel to the inner surface of the thyroid lamina.

Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 58 of the 66 culture-positive specimens (88%). Anaerobes only were recovered in 37 cases (56%) and in 21 (32%) they were mixed with aerobic or facultative bacteria. Aerobic or facultative bacteria were present in eight cases (12%). A total of 185 isolates (2.8 per specimen)--131 (2.0 per specimen) anaerobes and 54 (0.8 per specimen) aerobes or facultatives--were isolated. The predominant anaerobic organisms were anaerobic cocci and Bacteroides sp, and the predominant aerobes or facultatives were Streptococcus sp and Staphylococcus aureus. Twelve of the 27 Bacteroides sp that were tested for beta-lactamase (44%) produced the enzyme. These findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in chronic sinusitis.\r"

However, postoperative air conduction thresholds remained high, and 23% of the patients are using hearing aids. The average air-bone gap for the frequencies 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz does not provide information on patients' everyday hearing level, and should no longer be employed as an index for assessing the functional results of middle ear surgery.\r"

In contrast, perilymph anti-BSA levels were increased significantly in the left inner ears compared to the levels in the right inner ears.

The measurements showed the average pneumatized area in otosclerotic ears to be 17.4 +/- 5 cm2, in contrast to 12.9 +/- 4 cm2 for the healthy control ears. The difference between the two groups was highly significant (p less than .0001). While both groups showed a bell-shaped distribution of the measured pneumatized area, the curve of the otosclerotic ears was shifted significantly to the right. Our findings indicate a link between otosclerosis on the one hand and highly pneumatized mastoids on the other. This link between a hereditary disease and a specific type of pneumatization points to the likelihood that heredity also plays some role in determining the final type of pneumatization.\r"

The purpose of this study was to describe quantitatively the deterioration and loss of cochlear hair cells to serve as a basis for future experiments attempting to alter the course of this disorder. Cochleas from 37 LP/J inbred mice were examined by scanning electron microscopy. The stereocilia loss in the cochlea was evident as early as 15 weeks of age and progressed from the basal turn to the apex. Outer hair cells were affected more than inner hair cells. As outer hair cells deteriorated we observed fusion, bending, and breakage of stereocilia. There were no apparent differences in the mode of deterioration among the three rows of outer hair cells. Stereocilia fusion of inner hair cells occurred at an older age, and giant, elongated stereocilia were found in some of the animals.\r"

While both diazepam and phenobarbital increase GABA receptor chloride current, they may have different mechanisms of action, since they bind to different sites on the GABA receptor-chloride channel complex. We used the patch clamp technique to compare the effects of diazepam and phenobarbital on single GABA receptor currents. Outside-out patches were obtained from mouse spinal cord neurons grown in cell culture for 2 to 4 weeks. GABA (2 microM) evoked single channel currents that occurred as single brief openings or in bursts of multiple openings. Diazepam (20 nM) and phenobarbital (500 microM) both increased the GABA receptor current by increasing mean open time without altering channel opening frequency. However, the temporal grouping of openings into bursts suggested that the enhancement occurred via different mechanisms. Diazepam increased the frequency of bursting GABA receptor currents with minimal effect on the duration of bursts. Phenobarbital increased the duration of bursting GABA receptor currents without altering the frequency of bursts. These results suggest that diazepam binds to a site that may enhance single channel burst frequency by increasing the affinity of GABA binding, while phenobarbital may stabilize the bursting open state of the channel by binding to a different modulatory site at or near the chloride channel.\r"

These symptoms and disorders could be grouped into four distinct clinical patterns comprising encephalopathy, multiple cerebral infarctions, migraine-like headaches, and visual abnormalities including amaurosis fugax and ischemic optic neuropathy. Cerebral ischemia best explained these neurological dysfunctions. There was no correlation between the presence or absence of neurological disease and ACLA levels, but ACLA levels were higher in patients with encephalopathy than in others with neurological involvement (p less than 0.05). How neurological dysfunction and the presence of these antiphospholipid antibodies are related remains to be clarified. Nevertheless, in patients with unexplained cerebral ischemia, establishing the presence of ACLA may have prognostic and therapeutic importance. In particular, acute immunosuppressive therapy and plasmapheresis may be useful in patients with acute ischemic encephalopathy.\r"

It was found that the normal fibroblasts adhered better to plastic than did AD cells. This reduced adhesiveness was observed in fibroblasts derived from both sporadic and familial AD patients. Because of the possible involvement of amyloid beta-protein precursor (ABPP) in the process of cellular adhesion, the amount of ABPP messenger RNA was measured in these fibroblasts and was found to be decreased in the familial AD fibroblasts, although not in cells from sporadic AD patients. Furthermore, there were fewer molecules detected by an anti-ABPP antibody in conditioned media from familial AD fibroblasts as compared with media from control fibroblasts. Therefore, although it is possible that the reduced adhesiveness of familial AD fibroblasts may result from genetic deficits in ABPP gene expression, the reduced adhesiveness of sporadic AD fibroblasts most likely results from certain deficits in molecules other than the ABPP.\r"

In the vascular lesions the cellular infiltrates were composed primarily of T cells (71 +/- 18%; mean +/- SD) and macrophages (27 +/- 17%), and the majority of the T cells (65 +/- 20%) were cytotoxic/suppressor CD8 cells. B cells were seen in only 4 cases and constituted less than 2% of all cells. Natural killer cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were rare, and a leukocytoclastic response was not observed. Fourteen biopsy specimens had vascular deposits of immunoglobulins G and M and complement components C3 and C5b-9 membrane attack complex, while 4 had only the latter. The fact that the immunoglobulin and complement deposits were seen only in vessels that had corresponding intense cellular infiltrates suggests an important, but perhaps not primary, role for immune complexes in causing the vascular lesions. Statistical analysis revealed striking similarities in the lesions of patients with isolated nerve vasculitis and those with systemic vasculitides, suggesting a common pathogenic mechanism. Collectively, our observations suggest an important role for a T-cell-dependent cell-mediated process as a primary mechanism of vessel injury in peripheral nerve vasculitis.\r"

This finding suggests that there are subregional as well as compartmental differences in the vulnerability of the calcineurin-positive cells in the striatum of patients with HD.\r"

  ".W": "Azithromycin, a novel azalide antibiotic, concentrated in human and mouse polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), murine peritoneal macrophages, and mouse and rat alveolar macrophages, attaining intracellular concentrations up to 226 times the external concentration in vitro. In murine peritoneal macrophages, azithromycin achieved concentration gradients (internal to external) up to 26 times higher than erythromycin. The cellular uptake of azithromycin was dependent on temperature, viability, and pH and was decreased by 2,4-dinitrophenol. Azithromycin did not decrease phagocyte-mediated bactericidal activity or affect PMN or macrophage oxidative burst activity (H2O2 release or Nitro Blue Tetrazolium reduction, respectively). Azithromycin remained in cells for several hours, even after extracellular drug was removed. However, its release was significantly enhanced by phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus (82 versus 23% by 1.5 h). In vivo, 0.05 micrograms of azithromycin was found in peritoneal fluids of mice 20 h after oral treatment with a dose of 50 mg/kg. Following caseinate-induced PMN infiltration, there was a sixfold increase in peritoneal cavity azithromycin to 0.32 micrograms, most of which was intracellular. Therefore, the uptake, transport, and later release of azithromycin by these cells demonstrate that phagocytes may deliver active drug to sites of infection.\r"

A secondary objective of this study was to assess the effect of food on the absorption of cefetamet pivoxil in the elderly. Twenty-four healthy subjects (twelve young and twelve elderly) received (in a Latin square design) a single-dose, 515-mg infusion of cefetamet, a single 1,000-mg oral dose of cefetamet pivoxil during fasted conditions, and a single 1,000-mg oral dose of cefetamet pivoxil 10 min after a standardized low-fat breakfast. Serial blood and urine samples were collected over a 36-h period and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Intravenous and oral pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by using model-independent techniques. The systemic clearance and renal clearance of cefetamet were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in elderly subjects compared with in young controls after intravenous administration. No significant difference was observed in the apparent volumes of distribution at steady state between the two groups. Consequently, half-life and mean residence time were prolonged. A trend toward a lower renal clearance/creatinine clearance ratio was observed in our elderly population. Oral clearance of cefetamet was only slightly reduced in our elderly subjects, consistent with an increase in plasma half-life. Otherwise, oral pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable between elderly and young subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The major outer membrane protein was extracted from Campylobacter coli by Triton X-100/EDTA fractionation of cell envelopes. This heat-modifiable protein was shown to have pore-forming activity in black lipid bilayers. The C. coli porin formed a relatively small cation-selective pore with a mean single-channel conductance of 0.53 +/- 0.16 nS in 1.0 M KCl. There was no evidence of oligomer formation, which suggested that each protein monomer formed a pore. Pore-forming activity of the C. coli porin and similarly prepared Campylobacter jejuni porin was also measured in liposome-swelling assays. These results confirmed the cation selectivity of both pores. The C. coli porin formed a small pore, which hindered the penetration of solutes with a molecular weight of 262, and a larger pore, which hindered the penetration of solutes with a molecular weight of 340, in a protein-concentration-dependent manner. C. jejuni formed one size of pore that was slightly larger than the C. coli pore and just permitted the passage of solutes, with a molecular weight of 340. A review of the literature concerning in vitro screening of antimicrobial agents tended to confirm the low permeability of the C. jejuni outer membrane to hydrophilic antimicrobial agents except when the molecules had molecular weights of less than 360. The porins of C. jejuni and C. coli may contribute to intrinsic resistance to antimicrobial agents, whereas alternative (nonporin) routes of antimicrobial agent uptake may be more important determinants of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.\r"

This assay is sensitive (to 0.4 microM), specific (no interference with 34 commonly prescribed drugs), reproducible (coefficients of variation from 5.4 to 22.4%), and linear (r = 0.999) over the range of clinically relevant concentrations in serum (from 0.5 to 50.0 microM). It also correlates well with the ribavirin radioimmunoassay (r = 0.992). This HPLC assay should be useful for measuring ribavirin in serum and other body fluids during clinical trials.\r"

The partition coefficient of BP in a 50:50 artificial skin lipid and water system was greater than 2,500, with the concentration of BP soluble in lipid measured at 1.12% and in water at 0.005%. When BP was incubated in the presence of a lipid mixture, reaction products were formed, with evidence that at least some of these compounds possessed antibacterial activity. These results suggest that BP reduces the P. acnes numbers in sebaceous follicles because of good lipid solubility and interaction with the lipid component, the latter property contributing to the antimicrobial activity of the compound in a high-lipid environment.\r"

There were no significant differences in either the kinetics of 109Cd2+ uptake or the retention of accumulated 109Cd2+ by the tolerant and susceptible strains. Both tolerant and susceptible strains removed most of the cadmium from the culture medium, but significantly more was removed by cells of the tolerant strain. Most of the accumulated Cd2+ in the tolerant strain was in the particulate fraction, rather than in the soluble fraction. Intracellular accumulated Cd2+ was primarily in the soluble fraction of the susceptible strain.

Single 2-g doses of cefmetazole sodium and cefoxitin sodium were given intravenously as a 5-min infusion. Concentrations of cefmetazole and cefoxitin were determined by using a specific semiautomated high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Concentration-time profiles of cefmetazole and cefoxitin declined in a biexponential manner from peak levels. Compared with cefoxitin, cefmetazole had a significantly (P less than 0.05) higher mean (+/- standard error of the mean) peak concentration in serum (290 +/- 11 versus 244 +/- 10 micrograms/ml), a longer terminal disposition half-life (1.50 +/- 0.14 versus 0.81 +/- 0.04 h), lower systemic clearance (111.7 +/- 4.7 versus 279 +/- 12 ml/min) and renal clearance (78.7 +/- 4.3 versus 221 +/- 14 ml/min) of intact drug, and a slightly smaller steady-state volume of distribution (10.3 +/- 0.21 versus 12.8 +/- 0.48 liters). Mean recoveries of cefmetazole and cefoxitin in urine were approximately 71 and 77%, respectively. Pretreatment of volunteers with probenecid (1 g orally) significantly (P less than 0.05) increased concentrations of cefmetazole in serum 1 h after drug administration without significantly increasing maximum concentrations in serum. Mean areas under the concentration-time curve (466 +/- 27 versus 295 +/- 13 micrograms.h/ml) and terminal disposition half-lives (2.27 +/- 0.13 versus 1.50 +/- 0.14 h) of cefmetazole increased.

For some strains, the inconsistency arises from difficulty in determining the endpoint of growth in agar dilution susceptibility tests. Certain strains persist as a subtle haze beyond the levels of antibiotic that permit conventional colonial growth. We have determined by light and electron microscopy that this haze represents the colonial growth of cell-wall-defective (CWD) variants of the parent Fusobacterium. The CWD forms could be propagated indefinitely in hypertonic medium containing the antibiotic inducing agent. However, when the antibiotic was eliminated, the organisms would revert to their native morphology. Formation of CWD variants was observed in the presence of cell-wall-active drugs (e.g., beta-lactam agents) but not with drugs that work by a different mechanism (e.g., clindamycin or chloramphenicol). Fourteen of 22 F. varium strains, 8 of 11 F. mortiferum strains, 2 of 10 F. gonidiaformans strains, and 1 of 4 of F. necrophorum strains could be induced to a CWD form in vitro in the usual agar dilution susceptibility test. Although the clinical significance of CWD variants of Fusobacterium is unknown, they may be a source of confusion in interpreting agar dilution susceptibility tests.\r"

We used the same approach but with only 5 days of spraying (5 x 10(6) IU on day 1 and 2.5 x 10(6) IU on each subsequent day). This amount has been effective in studies involving seasonal prophylaxis. During the study period, a total of 178 rhinoviruses were isolated from the 199 enrolled families in Tecumseh, Mich. There were 434 courses of IFN use and 434 courses of placebo use. Although rhinoviruses were less frequently isolated from those using IFN than those using the placebo, no differences favoring IFN treatment could be found in any of the symptomatic episodes. In fact, more episodes were observed in IFN recipients than in placebo recipients, although the differences were not statistically significant. Additionally, there was no evidence of modification of the severity of episodes of illness. It was concluded that prevention of rhinovirus illness episodes postexposure required a dosage of at least 5 x 10(6) IU of IFN-alpha 2b.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the influence of several pharmacokinetic parameters on cure rates in rabbits with experimental pneumococcal meningitis. When the duration of treatment was kept constant, cure rates improved as the individual dose of ampicillin was increased. On the other hand, when four doses of ampicillin at 60 mg/kg of body weight, producing peak concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of approximately 40 times the MBC, were administered at intervals of 24 instead of 4 h and the duration of therapy was thus prolonged from 12 to 72 h, cure rates also increased (85 versus 25%; P less than 0.01). These high cure rates were achieved even though bacterial titers in CSF 24 h after the first dose had reached levels similar to those present at the beginning of therapy. Cure in these animals was explained by the fact that the second ampicillin dose reduced bacterial titers in CSF significantly more than did the first dose (5.2 versus 2.5 log10 CFU/ml; P less than 0.02). The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Two strains of Staphylococcus aureus expressing borderline or low-level methicillin resistance by one or more in vitro test methods were examined for resistance in vivo and for biochemical and genetic markers of methicillin resistance. In vivo, nafcillin was equally effective against experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits, regardless of whether they were infected by a fully susceptible or a low-level-resistant strain. Resistance did not emerge during therapy. For the more resistant of the two low-level-resistant strains, methicillin was as effective as nafcillin. Nafcillin was ineffective against endocarditis caused by a truly methicillin-resistant strain, and resistance emerged on therapy. The low-level-resistant strains did not produce the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein 2a that is associated with methicillin resistance and did not contain DNA that hybridized with probes that recognized the methicillin resistance determinant. Low-level resistance in S. aureus is a phenomenon that is biochemically and genetically distinct from true methicillin resistance. These strains actually are susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. The clinical problem posed by these strains is not a therapeutic one but, instead, one of how to differentiate them from those that are truly methicillin resistant.\r"

On one occasion, subjects were given 30 ml of aluminum hydroxide orally four times a day for 4 days, beginning 2 days prior to doxycycline dosing. Blood and urine samples were collected up to 48 and 96 h after the infusion, respectively, and were analyzed by a microbial assay. Values for volume of distribution at steady state, nonrenal clearance, urine recovery, and urine pH were not statistically different among treatment groups. With concomitant antacid therapy, the half-life of intravenous doxycycline was shortened from 16.2 +/- 2.6 to 11.2 +/- 1.2 h (P = 0.003), and total body clearance increased from 37.4 +/- 6.5 to 54.1 +/- 12.3 ml/min (P = 0.008). Area under the concentration-time curve for serum was decreased by 18 to 44%, with a 22 to 41% increase in renal clearance. Although the increase in nonrenal clearance ranged from 11 to 128%, the high variability led to a nonsignificant difference (P = 0.07).

  ".W": "Dialyzed extracts of the gentamicin producer Micromonospora purpurea catalyze reactions which represent transaminations proposed for 2-deoxystreptamine biosynthesis. To determine whether these transaminations were catalyzed by a single aminotransferase or by multiple enzymes, we purified and characterized an L-glutamine:keto-scyllo-inositol aminotransferase from M. purpurea. This enzyme was purified 130- to 150-fold from late-log-phase mycelia of both wild-type M. purpurea and a 2-deoxystreptamine-less idiotroph. The cofactor pyridoxal phosphate was found to be tightly bound to the enzyme, and spectral analysis demonstrated its participation in the transamination reactions of this enzyme. The major physiological amino donor for the enzyme appears to be L-glutamine; the keto acid product derived from glutamine was characterized as 2-ketoglutaramate, indicating that the alpha amino group of glutamine participates in the transamination. We found that crude extracts contained omega-amidase activity, which may render transaminations with glutamine irreversible in vivo. The substrate specificity of the aminotransferase was shown to be restricted to deoxycyclitols, monoaminocyclitols, and diaminocyclitols, glutamine, and 2-ketoglutaramate, which contrasts with the broader substrate specificity of mammalian glutamine aminotransferase. The appearance of the enzyme in late-log phase, coupled with its narrow substrate specificity, indicates that it participates predominantly in 2-deoxystreptamine biosynthesis rather than in general metabolism. The enzyme catalyzes reactions which represent both transamination steps of 2-deoxystreptamine biosynthesis. Although copurification of two aminotransferases cannot be ruled out, our data are consistent with the participation of a single aminotransferase in the formation of both amino groups of 2-deoxystreptamine during biosynthesis by M. purpurea.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found that S. haemolyticus represented 70 of 524 (13%) coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates identified by the clinical microbiology laboratories of two hospitals over 2 months. S. haemolyticus isolates were recovered from wounds (44%), urine (26%), blood (10%), and other sources (20%). All S. haemolyticus isolates were tested for susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents; 77% were resistant to three or more agents, and 41% were resistant to five or six agents. In addition, among 47 multiply resistant isolates, high MICs (greater than or equal to 6.25 micrograms/ml) of vancomycin (62% of isolates) and teicoplanin (91% of isolates) were found. DNA probes which were derived from S. epidermidis or S. aureus and which contained sequences associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents were used to detect specific genes in the total cellular and plasmid DNAs of 10 resistant S. haemolyticus isolates. Resistance gene probes and the numbers of resistant isolates hybridizing were as follows: methicillin, 10 of 10; gentamicin, 9 of 10; erythromycin, 7 of 10; and trimethoprim, 0 of 10. Genes for resistance to methicillin were found only in chromosomal locations, genes for resistance to gentamicin were found in both chromosomal and plasmid locations, and genes for resistance to erythromycin were found in plasmid locations only. With the exception of trimethoprim resistance determinants, similar genes were found among concurrently isolated multiply resistant S. epidermidis isolates from our hospitals. S. haemolyticus is a potentially important nosocomial species which readily acquires antimicrobial resistance genes and which shares, to some extent, in a common gene pool with S. epidermidis.\r"

However, little is known about the penetration of fluconazole into tissue sites other than cerebrospinal fluid. We therefore studied by high-pressure liquid chromatography the penetration of fluconazole into nine different tissue sites at times of peak and trough concentrations in plasma in rabbits. Fluconazole penetrated into all tissue sites. Tissue/plasma concentration ratios were greater at time of trough concentrations in plasma than at times of peak concentrations in plasma. The finding that fluconazole penetrated into target organs commonly infected by Candida spp. and C. neoformans further supports the therapeutic potential of fluconazole for disseminated candidiasis or cryptococcosis in immunocompromised hosts.\r"

Ten xanthine-free, fasting males were given 100 mg of caffeine orally 24 h before being given ciprofloxacin and again with the third dose of ciprofloxacin (750 mg administered every 12 h). Blood samples were serially collected after both doses of caffeine and after the first and last doses of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin significantly increased the half-life of caffeine (from 5.2 +/- 1.2 to 8.2 +/- 2.5 h) and the area under the caffeine concentration-time curve (from 16.3 +/- 6.6 to 25.9 +/- 7.8 micrograms.h/ml) while decreasing the total body clearance (from 106 +/- 41.6 to 58.2 +/- 28.8 ml/min per 1.73 m2). In addition, the rate of conversion of caffeine to paraxanthine was significantly delayed. There was no significant linear correlation between the urinary recovery of oxociprofloxacin at 0 to 12 h and the change in the area under the caffeine concentration-time curve. There was also a small but statistically significant increase in the area under the ciprofloxacin concentration-time curve during simultaneous administration of caffeine. We concluded that ciprofloxacin causes a significant increase in the half-life of caffeine and in the area under the caffeine concentration-time curve by reducing total body clearance. This interaction is due at least in part to a delay in the conversion of caffeine to paraxanthine. The clinical significance of these observations remains to be determined. Lastly, caffeine may alter the kinetics of ciprofloxacin, a possibility which should be more fully explored.\r"

  ".U": "89271804\r", 
  ".W": "The very limited development of antiparasitic agents targeting protein synthesis stems in part from the belief that parasite and host ribosomes are sufficiently similar to preclude selective toxicity. However, recent studies have revealed that Giardia lamblia rRNA has an unusual size and sequence; consequently, this organism and its homogeneous rRNA provide a useful model for the development of protein synthesis inhibitors with antiparasitic activity. In this study, I determined the sequence and secondary structure of the 3' end of the small-subunit RNA, the target for aminoglycoside inhibitory activity. The primary structure of these 140 nucleotides includes two blocks of sequence highly conserved among other organisms; the remaining sequence, although not conserved, can be folded into a secondary structure common to all rRNAs. The presence of U-1495 within one of the conserved blocks predicts hygromycin susceptibility. Also, a specific base pair (C-1409.G-1491) implicated in paromomycin susceptibility is present; whereas all procaryotes have this base pair, it is absent in many eucaryotes (including mammals). Conversely, kanamycin and apramycin resistance can be predicted from substitution of A-1408 with G. A growth inhibition assay was used to test the susceptibility of G. lamblia to a variety of aminoglycosides. After 48 h, 8 of 11 aminoglycosides tested failed to inhibit growth at a concentration of 200 micrograms/ml. Paromomycin and hygromycin, however, inhibited growth of three strains tested by 50% at 50 to 60 micrograms/ml and by close to 90% at 120 micrograms/ml. These results correlate well with the sequence and secondary-structure analyses. Paromomycin may be clinically useful when the toxicity of standard antigiardial drugs is of concern.\r"

The drug was well tolerated, with no adverse medical events or laboratory changes observed during the study that could affect the pharmacokinetic interpretation of the data. Cefmetazole concentrations were determined by using a specific high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Serum cefmetazole concentrations were well described by a one-compartment open model with first-order absorption and elimination. Cefmetazole was rapidly absorbed in most volunteers, with a mean time to maximum concentration in serum of 1.24 +/- 0.12 h (+/- standard error of the mean), and the mean maximum concentration in serum increased from 17.0 +/- 1.6 to 74.2 +/- 9.5 micrograms/ml over the 0.375- to 2-g dose range. Maximum concentrations in serum, areas under serum concentration-time curve, and urinary excretion of intact drug increased in proportion to cefmetazole sodium dose. Times at which maximum concentrations in serum occurred, apparent volumes of distribution, steady-state volumes of distribution, absorption and elimination half-lives, and systemic clearances did not change significantly (P greater than 0.05) with drug dose. Although absorption and elimination half-lives were not significantly different in 10 of 40 volunteers (P greater than 0.05), in a majority of subjects elimination half-lives were approximately 10 times longer than absorption half-lives.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rats receiving 2 mg of cisplatin per kg of body weight for 5 days showed significant (P less than 0.01 by multiple-comparison test) elevation of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentrations compared with rats receiving saline alone and also exhibited development of cell lesions in the pars recta of the tubules in the outer stripe of the outer medulla. However, piperacillin (250 and 1,000 mg/kg) significantly (P less than 0.01 by multiple-comparison test) reduced these toxicological parameters in comparison with results for cisplatin alone. The protective effect of piperacillin was superior to that of fosfomycin, although platinum levels in the kidney were higher with the combination of cisplatin and piperacillin than with cisplatin plus fosfomycin. Although the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin was also reduced when cisplatin was administered concomitantly with sodium chloride in mole-equivalents to 250 and 1,000 mg of piperacillin per kg, its protective effect was less than that of the corresponding piperacillin dose. These results suggest that piperacillin may have a role as a protective agent against the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin.\r"

Phototoxicity, consisting of wheal-and-flare reactions following exposure to ultraviolet radiation, was demonstrated following the administration of naproxen and nabumetone, but was not seen in volunteers who received piroxicam, a drug reported to cause photosensitivity. Thus, although certain NSAIDs are potentially capable of producing phototoxicity reactions, others can presumably provoke clinical photosensitivity through other mechanisms.\r"

The degree of this reduction was directly related to the severity of the skin involvement by EB with recessive dystrophic EB patients having the lowest NK activity. The absolute number of cells bearing NK surface markers in the peripheral blood of patients with recessive dystrophic EB did not differ from that of normal control subjects. This reduced NK activity may be at least partially responsible for the occurrence of septicemia in some persons with severe forms of EB and for the development of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in patients with dystrophic EB.\r"

There was no significant improvement in the generally poor neurological outcome compared with that in 24 infants whose seizures were not treated because of limited or absent clinical manifestations. Background EEG abnormality (as an index of associated cerebral dysfunction) was a guide to potential lack of response to anticonvulsant drugs; it was also predictive of subsequent clinical outcome irrespective of treatment. This study shows that commonly used anticonvulsant drugs (phenobarbitone, paraldehyde, phenytoin, and diazepam) have little effect on seizure control or neurological outcome in neonatal seizures associated with haemorrhagic, hypoxic, or ischaemic cerebral lesions. In view of the variable clinical appearance of EEG seizure activity, continuous EEG monitoring should be an essential feature of further study of neonatal anticonvulsant treatment.\r"

There was a significant correlation between sodium and glucose concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid with prolonged hypoglycorrhachia accompanying posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Raised concentrations of potassium in cerebrospinal fluid occur with intraventricular haemorrhage and may contribute to the development of cerebral infarction.\r"

  ".W": "After immunohistochemical staining the size and maturational stage of fetal megakaryocytes from 20 human fetuses of 12 to 21 weeks' gestation were compared with those from normal adults. The mean diameter of fetal megakaryocytes was 14.0 microns when stained with antiglycoprotein IIb (Tab) and 15.2 microns when stained with antifactor VIII, which was significantly smaller than adult megakaryocytes, which were 18.4 microns when stained with Tab and 20.6 microns when stained with factor VIII. The proportion of immature (stage II) cells was higher--and the proportion of mature (stage IV) cells was lower--in the fetal tissue than in the adult. The smaller size and shift to a less mature population indicated that there were differences at the non-mitotic phase of the development of megakaryocytes in the fetus. Such differences were probably associated with quantitative and qualitative platelet abnormalities in newborn infants. Understanding the physiology and regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis in fetuses and newborn infants will be invaluable in determining the pathophysiology of platelet dysfunction in the newborn.\r"

On the second and third occasions, weight, crown-heel length, and bone mineral content of their forearms were measured. Fifteen infants born at full term on whom similar measurements were made soon after birth acted as controls. Between 32 and 39 weeks the median weight of ELBW infants increased from 970 g to 1850 g and crown-heel length from 35.7 cm to 41.0 cm. There was no evidence, however, of bone mineral accretion in the measurement region; initial and final median measurements of bone mineral content were 76 mg/cm and 86 mg/cm, the median individual difference being only 4 mg/cm with an interquartile range of 25 mg/cm. Median weight, crown-heel length, and bone mineral content of the control group were 3270 g, 50.6 cm, and 196 mg/cm, respectively. Compared with the controls, ELBW infants at 39 weeks were a median (interquartile range) of 1420 (525) g lighter, 9.9 (3.9) cm shorter, and had a bone mineral content deficit of 108 (32) mg/cm. In terms of weight and crown-heel length ELBW infants at 39 weeks were comparable with infants born and observed at 32 weeks' gestation; compared with these infants the bone mineral content deficit in the ELBW group was about 33%.\r"

During the same period there was an increase in the proportion of children included in the Medical Research Council trials and an increase in the proportion who were treated at centres with an average of at least six new patients per year. Survival rates were significantly higher for children who were included in the trials than for those who were not. Among children not in the trials, the survival rate was highest at centres treating at least six children per year and lowest at those with fewer than one per year. The increase in the numbers of children treated according to standardised protocols, particularly within controlled clinical trials, has had a major impact on the mortality from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\r"

Clinical symptoms, not always clearly related to HIV became apparent in 11 children, and preceding immune abnormalities were documented in two of them. In eight children culture for HIV was positive, and six of these were symptomatic. No cancers were diagnosed and none of the children died. Immune abnormalities including hypergammaglobulinaemia, IgG subclass deficiency, low serum IgA concentration, antibody deficiency, a decrease in the number of CD4+(T helper) cells, and defective cellular responses to antigens, were found in seven of the children in whom culture for HIV was positive; in two of four who had symptoms and in all four who were symptom free and in whom culture was negative for HIV but in whom HIV antibodies persisted and who were older than 15 months; and in three of nine who were symptom free and in whom culture was negative with loss of HIV antibodies. We conclude that serological diagnosis alone may be misleading and that additional immunological assessment may help to identify affected children. Analysis of humoral and cellular responses to antigens used for vaccination such as tetanus toxoid by measurement of specific antibodies and skin testing are simple and helpful in clinical practice.\r"

These pregnancies accounted for 1.3% of all the births and 44% of all the fetal and neonatal deaths in pregnancies that lasted more than 23 weeks. Most of the 389 singleton deliveries without malformations between 24 and 31 weeks were caused by spontaneous premature labour (n = 119, 31%), placental abruption (n = 79, 20%), pre-eclampsia (n = 56, 14%), and premature rupture of membranes (n = 48, 12%). The percentages of babies alive at the onset of delivery who survived the neonatal period were 66, 84, 78, and 73, respectively and the percentages of neonatal survivors with severe disabilities were 19, 13, 3, and 6, respectively. A further 65 (17%) of these babies died before the onset of labour for no obvious reason. The mode of delivery did not correlate with the outcome once the period of gestation at delivery was taken into account. The results highlight the inadequacy of the perinatal mortality index currently used in the United Kingdom, which identified 10.7 deaths/1000 registered births in 1983; 20% of the babies delivered at 24-31 weeks were excluded by this index because the birth went unregistered, as were 21% of all the babies born alive who died before discharge. An index that accounted for all babies weighing 500 g or more at birth irrespective of the period of gestation, and all neonatal (0-27 days) deaths, would be more appropriate and would bring reporting more into line with recommended international practice.\r"

  ".W": "All surviving babies of less than 32 weeks' gestation born to mothers resident in the Northern region in 1983 were assessed. No baby was lost to follow up, and 230 long term survivors were assessed when 2 years old, by a single observer. Among 248 neonatal survivors, severe disability was present in 10 of the 37 at 24-27 weeks' gestation (27%) and in 18 of the 211 at 28-31 weeks' gestation (9%). On average the surviving babies required 27 days and seven days of intensive care nursing respectively. Babies who were ventilated for more than two weeks and babies who had neonatal fits had a poor prognosis. Because of postneonatal deaths only 20 of the 230 long term survivors of less than 32 weeks' gestation were severely disabled (9%). Comparable data were obtained for all babies weighing 1500 g or less at birth, irrespective of their gestational age. Severe disability was seen in eight of the 49 neonatal survivors (16%) who had weighed 500-999 g at birth, and in 17 of the 171 survivors (10%) who had weighed 1000-1499 g. The 10 neonatal survivors who had weighed exactly 1500 g at birth were all well. Only 18 of the 212 long term survivors (8%) who had weighed 1500 g or less at birth were severely disabled. Because the period of gestation is the only variable known to the obstetrician before delivery, and disability correlates better with gestation than birth weight, future studies should concentrate on relating morbidity, mortality, and the cost of neonatal care to gestation rather than weight at birth.\r"

On admission 53 (88.3%) of the infants had body temperatures between 30 degrees and 36 degrees C. There was good correlation between axillary and rectal temperatures in the infants while they were hypothermic. Normal temperatures were achieved within the first day and remained within this range during the subsequent days after admission in all the infants treated on the heated, water filled mattress, whereas they were not achieved until three days later in the incubator group. The neonatal mortality among those treated on the heated, water filled mattress was 21%, and among those treated in the incubator 34%. The heated, water filled mattress provides a good alternative to skin to skin contact with the mother, and to the use of a complex and expensive incubator for rapidly attaining and maintaining normal temperatures in the low birthweight newborn.\r"

Eighteen (72%) of the families felt they had been well supported by the hospice and valued the family like atmosphere, perceiving the staff to be friendly, approachable, and helpful. The actual nature of hospice care, in an environment with other terminally ill children, was, however, considered a drawback for a few families. A number of families still had unmet needs, notably appropriate child minding when away from the hospice. The impact of chronic life threatening illness on the families was substantial. The parents (particularly the mothers), the index children, and their siblings all experienced much higher levels of psychological symptomatology than would have been expected from normal samples. While families felt greatly helped over symptom control, a proportion remained very worried about certain symptoms, particularly breathlessness, seizures, and pain. A high proportion of families were experiencing financial and employment difficulties as a result of their children's illnesses.\r"

Investigation of the cause excluded infection and trauma, or a primary metabolic, pulmonary, cardiac, or seizure disorder. Seven infants were deeply comatose on admission, never regained consciousness, and died within 60 hours. A characteristic evolution of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy not previously clearly described after near miss SIDS was seen in the seven who lived. Five of the seven were conscious within one hour of resuscitation and showed a striking interval of near normality before neurological deterioration that was characterised by status epilepticus, deep coma, and brain stem dysfunction from 36-96 hours after the event. A biphasic course was not apparent in the remaining two, each of whom was comatose on admission, though refractory seizures did develop. Computed tomograms of the brain more than a week after the event showed cortical infarction or cerebral atrophy. Six of the survivors, followed up from 16-55 months, have serious residual deficits including spastic quadriplegia, delayed development, cortical blindness, or infantile spasms.\r"

Eighteen (29%) were found to have thyroid dysfunction, and these included all those who had had lymphangiograms or received a radiation dose greater than 40 Gy to the thyroid area. Only nine of the 18 children were already known to have thyroid dysfunction, and only 15 of 44 children who had had irradiation to the thyroid area had had their thyroid function examined. This study shows that children who have received radiotherapy to the thyroid area should have their thyroid function assessed regularly.

Infants in the control group (n = 53) were not reported to cry excessively by their mothers. Breath samples were collected using a face mask sampling device preprandially, and 90 and 150 minutes after the start of a feed. Normalised breath hydrogen concentrations were higher in the group with colic than in the control group at each time point. The median maximum breath hydrogen concentration in the colic group was 29 ppm, and in the control group 11 ppm. The percentage of infants with incomplete lactose absorption (breath hydrogen concentration more than 20 ppm) in the colic group was 62% compared with 32% in the control group. The clinical importance of the observed association between increased breath hydrogen excretion and infantile colic remains to be determined. Increased breath hydrogen excretion indicative of incomplete lactose absorption may be either a cause or an effect of colic in infants.\r"

The day prior to their operations, 126 patients were admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, where pulmonary artery catheters were inserted without serious complications. One hundred and eleven patients tolerated the entire 2-L infusion. The hemoglobin concentration of blood was measured before and after the infusion. The fractional change in blood volume (BV after/BV before) calculated with hemoglobin data was 1.06 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- SD). A multivarient discriminant analysis showed that the fractional change in blood volume was a covariant with a higher correlation rank than the hemodynamic data in identifying patients at risk for an adverse outcome.\r"

A recurrent stenosis may occur as early as 6 months and will become symptomatic in 3% to 5% of patients. Early stenosis is myointimal hyperplasia, but with the passage of time may progress to the characteristic atherosclerotic lesion. Improvements in noninvasive testing allows for evaluation and early detection of restenosis. Since 1974 we have performed 3711 CEAs in 2909 patients. One hundred and six second or third CEAs were performed in 98 patients (3.5%). In 20 of these reoperations, the common carotid (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were resected and replaced by autogenous vein, usually saphenous. One of these patients had 3 previous CEAs while 7 patients had 2 and 12 patients had 1 previous operation. There were no deaths; thrombosis of one vein interposition requiring replacement occurred. Hoarseness and hypoglossal nerve palsy occurred in one patient. Follow-up ranged to 5 years with a mean of 2.8 years. Although a second CEA is possible, there are inherent technical difficulties that may be encountered and vein interposition will solve these as well as offer the potential to prevent a further recurrence.\r"

All hospitals in the county plus the single coroner's office provided the records of the 72 patients comprising this study. Incidents occurred most often in the home or residence (70%) by a known assailant (83%) due to domestic/social disputes (73%). Frequency was greatest in the evening hours (73% between 6:00 PM and 3:00 AM), on weekends in spring and summer. Victims tended to be male (86%), black (72%), married (46%), blue collar workers (62%). There were 41 (57%) gunshot wounds, 3 (4%) shotgun wounds, and 28 (39%) stab wounds with an associated mortality rate of 97%, 100%, and 68%, respectively. Prehospital mortality rate (dead at the scene) was 54.2% (39/72), and death on arrival was 26.4% (19/72), for a combined pretreatment mortality rate of 80.6%. All patients who arrived with no vital signs died. Mortality appeared to be related to mechanism of injury, age, race, sex, vital signs on arrival, number and specific cardiac chambers injured, associated major vascular injury, hematocrit, and mode of transportation. Mortality was not related to caliber of weapon, ethanol level, transport time, time from arrival to operation, or transfusion requirements. There were only ten survivors (1 gunshot wound and 9 stab wounds), all of whom had ventricular injuries and no associated major vascular injuries. The ten survivors represented a 71.4% (10/14) salvage rate for those victims arriving with vital signs. Complications occurred in three patients. Hospitalization averaged 7.3 days in the survivors. Penetrating cardiac trauma remains a serious, socially linked disease with a high rate of mortality. Rapid transport, aggressive resuscitation and cardiorrhaphy remain the best treatment.\r"

In contrast, patients with gastric ulcer perforation had differing characteristics from the group with perforated pyloroduodenal ulcers. Overall, NSAID use preceded perforation in one half of the patients; severe coexisting medical illness and a short interval of symptoms before perforation were seen in more than one half of patients. Gastric ulcer location, hemodynamic instability, greater degree of peritoneal contamination, and larger ulcer size were factors associated with increased rates of mortality. Overall mortality rate was 12.5% and rate of morbidity was 33%. Oversewing with or without omental patch was the operation most commonly employed by a diverse group of surgeons.\r"

A detailed civilian vascular trauma registry provides a unique opportunity for an epidemiologic evolutionary profile. During the last 30 years in a single civilian trauma center directed by a consistent evaluation and treatment philosophy, 4459 patients were treated for 5760 cardiovascular injuries. Eighty-six per cent of the patients were male, and the average age was 30.0 years. Penetrating trauma was the etiology in more than 90% (GSW,51.5%; SW,31.1%; SGW,6.8%). All other injuries were iatrogenic or secondary to blunt trauma. Truncal injuries (including the neck) accounted for 66% of all injuries treated, while lower extremity injuries (including the groin) accounted for only 19%. Injuries to the abdominal vasculature accounted for 33.7% of the injuries. One thousand fifty-seven patients had 2 or more concurrent vascular injuries, and 32 patients had 4 or more separate vascular injuries. The 27 patients-per-year average of the early 1960s has risen to a current average of 213 patients per year. Economic and population factors influenced wounding agents and injury patterns during the evaluation period. This extensive civilian series presents epidemiologic profiles that are distinctly different from military reports and serves as a guide for current trauma center and health planners.\r"

Colon wound management was undertaken without regard to associated injuries or amount of fecal contamination. Primary repair was performed in 83 patients, segmental resection with anastomosis in 12, and resection with end colostomy in 7. There were no suture line failures in the primary repair group, and one suture line failure in the anastomosis group. The one failure was in a patient who underwent repeated explorations for bleeding before the leak occurred. The septic complication rate was 33% of the entire series and was unrelated to primary repair. Logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors for sepsis included transfusion greater than or equal to 4 units (p less than 0.02), more than two associated injuries (p less than 0.04), significant contamination (p less than 0.05), and increasing colon injury severity scores (p less than 0.02). The method of colon wound management, location and mode of injury, presence of hypotension (BP less than 90), and age did not significantly contribute to sepsis. We conclude that nearly all penetrating colon wounds can be repaired primarily or with resection and anastomosis, regardless of risk factors.\r"

Age, sex, coronary anatomy, ejection fraction, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and the preoperative hematocrit, platelet count, and clotting studies were similar in both groups. Methods of blood conservation included autologous transfusion of blood withdrawn before bypass, autotransfusion of shed mediastinal blood, strict protocols for transfusion, and acceptance of normovolemic anemia. With blood conservation, 25.5% of patients received no transfusions and 54.9% received blood only. Significant reductions (p less than 0.001) were achieved in the transfusion of blood from 6.8 +/- 2.4 to 2.3 +/- 2.6 units per patient and of plasma from 2.5 +/- 2.2 to 0.6 +/- 2.0 units per patient. Reductions in the use of platelets and cryoprecipitate were substantial, although not significant. Total donor exposure was reduced significantly from 13.1 +/- 7.3 to 4.3 +/- 6.7 donors per patient. The postoperative hematocrit was significantly lower and remained so at discharge. However, 30 days later there was no difference. This reduction in transfusion requirements decreased costs and donor exposure.\r"

Medical therapy and prokinetic drugs have proven ineffective. This review evaluates 37 patients who underwent further gastric resection from 1979 to 1987 to improve gastric emptying and resolve symptoms. Fifteen patients underwent perioperative radionuclide solid-food gastric emptying studies. Seventy-three per cent (27 of 37 patients) of the patients who underwent further gastric resection (70% to 95%) had a satisfactory postoperative response. Twenty patients were graded Visick 1 or 2 and 7 Visick-3 patients, although much improved, still had some symptoms of gastroparesis. Twenty-seven per cent (10 of 37 patients) failed to improve and underwent completion total gastrectomy. Overall, 70% of this group had almost complete resolution of their symptoms. Three of 10 patients were considered \"failures\" due to postprandial pain in 1 and early vasomotor dumping in 2. Of the 10 patients who failed initial revisional surgery, 7 underwent a 70% to 80% subtotal gastric resection (STG) and 3 patients underwent 85% to 95% extensive resection (EXT.G.). Of the 15 patients who underwent perioperative radionuclide evaluation, a mean two-hour gastric retention of 61.4% +/- 4% (SEM) decreased to 25% +/- 4% following further gastric resection. Eight patients were in the STG group and seven patients were in the EXT.G group. Following STG, mean two-hour gastric retention of 58.2% +/- 3.5% decreased to 38% +/- 3% (p less than 0.05). In seven patients who underwent EXT.G, mean two-hour retention of 65% +/- 4% decreased to 10% +/- 2.5% (p less than 0.005). EXT.G resulted in normal gastric emptying and few late failures. In post-Roux-Y patients with symptoms of gastroparesis and documented gastric retention, EXT.G normalizes gastric emptying and restores a better quality of life. Total gastrectomy should be reserved for those patients who are failed by more extensive resection.\r"

Five patients had colorectal carcinoma in areas of dysplasia within histologically recognizable Crohn's disease. One of the large bowel carcinomas was a diffusely infiltrating signet ring adenocarcinoma (linitis plastica), three were mucinous carcinomas, and one contained both cell types. Survival ranged from 4 to 55 months. Three patients developed ileal carcinomas in areas of dysplasia within histologically recognizable Crohn's disease. One of the ileal cancers was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; two were poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. Survival ranged from 8 to 44 months. The dysplastic changes seen in the bowel adjacent to the tumors in these patients were identical to the characteristic pre-cancerous (dysplastic) changes well described in ulcerative colitis. The histopathologic changes seen in this high-risk group of patients are also similar to those of previously reported CDAC. Those patients with the more diffuse dysplastic changes might have been detected before the development of invasive cancer had they undergone periodic colonoscopic surveillance. One patient in the series with an asymptomatic lesion was, in fact, identified at surveillance colonoscopy. It would appear that Crohn's disease patients have a similar risk for carcinoma previously recognized in ulcerative colitis patients and that surveillance protocols should be developed for this group of patients.\r"

Careful visualization or palpation of the sites known to harbor secondary tumors is still recommended by many surgeons. The present study contrasts the results and morbidity of the retroperitoneal approach with that of the intraperitoneal operative approach for resection of pheochromocytoma. In the last 14 years, 37 patients had successful total resections of their pheochromocytomas, excluding one patient with metastasis to the liver at the time of surgery who died 10 years after operation. After preoperative localization of their tumors, 17 patients were explored anteriorly and 20 underwent resection using a lateral approach. Thirty-one patients have been followed from 2 to 141 (average 56) months. All patients have either returned to a normotensive state on no medication (27 patients) or, while requiring medication (9 patients), have had normal urinary metanephrine/catecholamine levels, except for the one patient with metatastic disease. There were substantial differences in morbidity rates between the two groups, however. Four patients (20%) had minor postoperative complications, following retroperitoneal resection that included pleural effusion, urinary retention, pulmonary congestion, and fever. Nine patients (53%) had complications when the anterior approach was used, including splenectomy in two, pneumonia, and postoperative fever. Postoperative hospital stay averaged 9.8 days (range, 4 to 21 days) for the anterior group and 6.1 days (range, 4 to 12 days) when a lateral approach was used (p = 0.002). Our data suggest that, with accurate unilateral localization, the flank, retroperitoneal approach for resection of pheochromocytoma can be used successfully with less morbidity.\r"

It was found that resectable BAC presents at an earlier disease stage than does adenocarcinoma; BAC occurs more frequently in older patients and in those without smoking history or chronic lung disease than adenocarcinoma; BAC patients have less weight loss, brain recurrences, and recurrences without second primaries than adenocarcinoma; survival and recurrence-free survival are better for BAC than for non-BAC adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma; early BAC survival is better than squamous-cell survival but after 2 years is equivalent; T1-N0 BAC patients have recurrence and survival rates similar to squamous-cell survival rates and better than non-BAC adeno survival rates; T1-N1/T2-N0 and Stage 2 and 3 BAC recurs more frequently than either squamous-cell or non-BAC adenocarcinoma; stage 2 and 3 BAC has a higher mortality rate than does squamous-cell carcinoma or non-BAC adenocarcinoma; BAC is a favorable prognostic factor when adjusted for extent of disease and age; and BAC's better prognosis is a result of presenting at an earlier stage of disease and because it appears to be less aggressive than other adenocarcinomas even after adjustment for extent of disease and other known prognostic factors. It is concluded that early diagnosis and resection are particularly important for patients with BAC.\r"

  ".U": "89272321\r", 
  ".W": "The continued good results after mitral valve reconstruction prompted this retrospective study to compare operative and late results from our institutional experience since 1976 with 975 porcine mitral valve replacements (MVRs) (1976 to December 1987), 169 mechanical MVRs (1976 to December 1987), and 280 Carpentier-type mitral valve reconstructions (CVRs) (1980 to mid-1988). The operative mortality was 2.0% for isolated CVR, 6.6% for isolated mechanical MVR, and 8.5% for isolated porcine MVR. The overall operative mortality was 5.0% for CVR, 16.6% for mechanical MVR, and 10.6% for porcine MVR. The overall 5-year survival including hospital deaths was 76% for CVR, 72% for mechanical MVR, and 69% for porcine MVR. By multivariate analysis, the predictors of increased operative risk and of decreased survival were age, New York Heart Association functional class IV status, previous cardiac operation, and performance of concomitant cardiac surgical procedures. The type of valvular procedure was not predictive of operative risk or overall survival. The 5-year freedom from reoperation was 94.4% for nonrheumatic patients having CVR, 77.4% for rheumatic patients having CVR, 96.4% for mechanical MVR, and 96.6% for porcine MVR (p less than 0.05, rheumatic patients with CVR versus both MVR groups). The 5-year freedom from all valve-related morbidity and mortality was significantly better for valve reconstruction compared with both types of valve replacement. Thus, the operative risk and late survival obtained after mitral valve reconstruction were at least equivalent to those obtained after MVR. In addition, patients receiving mitral valve reconstruction had less valve-related combined morbidity than patients receiving valve replacement, thus making mitral valve reconstruction preferable in some patients with mitral insufficiency.\r"

Animal experiments suggest that high-energy phosphate metabolism varies with maturation. To help answer these questions, 24 patients aged 2 months to 8 years underwent myocardial biopsy immediately after the institution of cardiopulmonary bypass (16 to 20 degrees C). Additional samples were obtained at 16 and 45 minutes after aortic cross-clamping and administration of cardioplegia (St. Thomas's solution) (in vivo ischemia). Seven patients also underwent major myocardial resection. Resected specimens were placed in a 37 degrees C bath and divided into equal-sized samples that were removed at ten-minute intervals (in vitro ischemia). All samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen and analyzed for adenine nucleotide pool metabolites using high-performance liquid chromatography. Levels of adenosine triphosphate were high before cross-clamping but diminished during the period of protected ischemia. Adenosine triphosphate loss was much more pronounced in patients less than 18 months old (p less than 0.05) and was associated with accumulation of adenosine monophosphate and inosine, a finding not seen in patients more than 18 months old (p less than 0.05). The same trends documented during in vivo ischemia were noted during in vitro ischemia. Immaturity of 5'-nucleotidase results in accumulation of adenosine monophosphate during ischemia. It is known that 5'-nucleotidase is present in neonatal myocardial cell membranes and absent from the cytosol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Surgical therapy for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not resulted in substantial long-term survival. Neoadjuvant treatment programs that could down-stage the tumor and achieve increased long-term survival would be of obvious benefit. We have used preoperative simultaneous chemotherapy and irradiation in 85 patients with clinical stage III non-small cell lung cancer considered candidates for surgical resection. One group of 56 patients was treated with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and simultaneous irradiation for five days every other week for a total of four cycles. After treatment, 39 patients underwent resection, and the operative mortality was 2 (5%) of 39. A second trial was undertaken in which etoposide (VP-16) was added because of its synergism with cisplatin. In this group, 29 patients were considered to have potentially resectable disease, and 23 underwent thoracotomy with 1 operative death (4%). Of the total of 62 patients having thoracotomy, 60 underwent resection (97%). Complications were major, and there were four bronchopleural fistulas. For the 85 patients eligible for surgical intervention in these two groups of patients, the Kaplan-Meier median survival estimate is 40% at 3 years. The median survival of the 62 patients having thoracotomy is 36.6 months. Combination preoperative chemotherapy and irradiation is feasible with acceptable toxicity and operative mortality in patients with clinical stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Prospective randomized studies are suggested for further evaluation of this treatment program.\r"

Physical examination was of aid in the diagnosis in only the 9 patients (27%) who demonstrated cervical or mediastinal emphysema. The initial chest roentgenogram was abnormal in 97% of the patients, but was interpreted as \"compatible with perforation of the esophagus\" in only 27%. Esophagography was diagnostic in 23 of 24 patients in whom it was used. Thoracentesis was of little diagnostic aid, but pleural fluid pH was measured in only 15% of the patients. Prompt surgical repair, regardless of time after onset, appears to be the indicated therapy.\r"

Since January 1987, 10 patients with endobronchial neoplasms have had bronchoscopic photodynamic therapy at similar dose rates (400 mW/cm) for total atelectasis (2), carinal narrowing with respiratory insufficiency (2), or partial obstruction without collapse (4). Two patients underwent photodynamic therapy as a preliminary to immunotherapy. Histologies included endobronchial metastases (colon, ovary, melanoma, and sarcoma, 1 each; and renal cell, 3) and primary lung cancer (3). The 2 patients with total atelectasis had complete reexpansion after photodynamic therapy, which permitted eventual sleeve lobectomy in 1. Carinal narrowing was ameliorated in the 2 patients seen with inspiratory stridor, thereby permitting hospital discharge. Endoscopically resected fragments after photodynamic therapy exhibited avascular necrosis. These data support further controlled studies of photodynamic therapy by thoracic surgical oncologists to define its limitations as well as to improve and expand its efficacy as a palliative or surgical adjuvant.\r"

  ".W": "The cases of 78 patients with primary esophageal carcinoma treated from 1977 to mid-1987 were retrospectively analyzed. Fifty-two of the patients underwent transthoracic esophagogastrectomy (TTE) and 26, transhiatal esophagectomy (THE). The two groups were statistically similar in preoperative characteristics except that more of the THE group had received chemotherapy; this group had relatively more tumors of the upper esophagus; and 20 (77%) of the THE group, compared with 50 (96%) of the TTE group, had tumors in stages III and IV. The incidence of major postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. There were five (19%) anastomotic leaks in the THE group, but only one led to a prolongation of hospital stay by more than 14 days, whereas all three (6%) of the leaks in the TTE group caused hospital stay to be prolonged several weeks. Overall morbidity was high: 75% (39/52) for the TTE patients and 85% (22/26) for the THE patients (p greater than 0.10). Hospital mortality was 6% (3/52) in the TTE group and 8% (2/26) in the THE patients (p greater than 0.10). There was no significant difference in actuarial survival either between the two groups as a whole or between those patients in each group who had stage III or IV tumors. We conclude that THE, among the types of patients for whom we used the procedure, provides long-term survival comparable with that provided by TTE without causing a significant increase in hospital mortality or morbidity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between 1976 and 1986, 19 children aged 1 month to 5 years underwent replacement of the mitral (systemic atrioventricular) valve. Indications for valve replacement included isolated congenital mitral stenosis (n = 2), valve dysfunction associated with a more complex procedure (n = 15), and failed valvuloplasty (n = 2). Seven different valve types were used; nine were mechanical valves and ten were bioprosthetic valves. There were 6 hospital deaths (32%; 70% confidence limits, 20% to 47%). Among the 13 survivors there were 3 late deaths at a mean of 14 months after operation. The late deaths were unrelated to valve malfunction. Thromboembolic events occurred in 2 patients, both with mechanical valves. One minor bleeding complication occurred among 10 patients on a regimen of Coumadin (crystalline warfarin sodium). Five patients, all with bioprostheses, required a second valve replacement. Indications for reoperation included prosthetic valve regurgitation (n = 1) and calcific stenosis (n = 4). No early or late deaths occurred after second valve replacement. Survival was 51% +/- 12% (standard error) at 112 months after valve replacement. Analysis failed to identify age, weight, sex, previous operation, underlying cardiac lesion, or prosthesis size and type as significant risk factors for mortality. Mechanical valves had a lower reoperation rate compared with bioprostheses. These data suggest that although mitral valve replacement within the first 5 years of life is associated with a high operative and late mortality, satisfactory long-term palliation for many patients can be achieved. Mechanical valves are superior to bioprosthetic valves, and offer the best long-term results.\r"

In 16 dogs, we studied the temporal extension of ischemia-induced right ventricular free wall infarction for one hour (n = 8) and two hours (n = 8) followed by two hours of reperfusion, and quantitated segmental shortening, area at risk from ischemia, and area of necrosis. Stroke volume decreased 7.3 +/- 0.5 mL/beat (+/- standard error of the mean) in one hour (p less than 0.05) and 7.4 +/- 1.3 mL/beat in two hours (p less than 0.05). Segmental shortening was replaced by paradoxical motion in both groups during ischemia, and remained depressed throughout reperfusion. Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased with ischemia and then returned to normal during reperfusion. The extent of infarction appeared proportionate to the duration of ischemia, 13.2% +/- 4.1% at one hour and 66.9% +/- 4.5% at two hours (p less than 0.01). We conclude that the wave front of necrosis in the right ventricle progresses with duration of ischemia and that clinical techniques capable of limiting the duration of ischemia might salvage substantial amounts of right ventricular myocardium.\r"

Patients with systolic paradoxically moving left ventricular aneurysms (n = 28) improved their functional classification (New York Heart Association) (p less than 0.01) and exercise tolerance (watt-minutes) (p less than 0.001) compared with preoperative values, in contrast to the patients with akinetic aneurysms (n = 13), whose status remained unchanged.

In a multivariate analysis of different preoperative variables, the presence of dyskinesia was found to be the only independent predictor of a favorable surgical outcome (p less than 0.004). In conclusion, the presence of dyskinesia represents an important marker of the outcome after aneurysmectomy.\r"

In group 2, atrial partitioning was accomplished with either a Dacron or a polytetrafluoroethylene patch, leaving the coronary sinus draining to the pulmonary venous atrium. Intraoperative distention of the left side was used to check for residual defects. In group 1, complete heart block developed in 5 patients (36%) and patch disruption, in 4 patients (29%). There were 3 late deaths (21%), which were due to sudden death, sepsis caused by Candida, and liver failure. In group 2, no patient had heart block, and patch disruption developed in 1 patient (5%). There was 1 early death (5%) and 2 late deaths (11%), which were due to sepsis caused by Candida and renal failure. Our experience suggests that atrial partitioning is a better approach than direct tricuspid patch closure in patients with complex lesions undergoing the Fontan operation.\r"

Mean arterial pressure fell to a similar extent in both treatment groups; however, left ventricular mass index decreased (from 102 +/- 4 to 95 +/- 2 g/m2) only in patients receiving calcium entry blockers, but not in those taking hydrochlorothiazide. The prevalence of premature ventricular contractions decreased 74% from 21 +/- 14/h to 5.7 +/- 6/h in the calcium entry blocker group, but did not change in the hydrochlorothiazide group (15 +/- 17/h to 16 +/- 13/h). Couplets, multiform contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia were completely abolished after calcium entry blocker therapy, whereas the prevalence of these arrhythmias remained unchanged during treatment with hydrochlorothiazide. We conclude that antihypertensive therapy with calcium entry blockers (but not with thiazide diuretics) reduces left ventricular mass and the prevalence and severity of ventricular dysrhythmias. Whether this reduction will improve the ominous prognosis of left ventricular hypertrophy and diminish the risk of sudden death remains unknown.\r"

Compared with patients with AIDS only, patients with both diagnoses were also more likely to be Haitian, black (other than Haitian), or Hispanic. Compared with patients with tuberculosis only, patients with both diagnoses were more likely to be younger, male, Haitian, black (other than Haitian), and Hispanic, have extrapulmonary tuberculosis and negative tuberculin skin tests, and have noncavitary chest roentgenograms.

Pulmonary tuberculosis was not suspected in 13 (42%) of 31 patients with active disease. These patients were elderly (92% aged 65 years or older vs 8% aged less than 65 years), had a delay in respiratory isolation (6 vs 1 days) and diagnosis (8 vs 3 days), in addition to a longer hospitalization (16 vs 11 days) with increased mortality (46% vs 11%).

Compared with patients with abnormal ECGs, patients with positive ECGs had a 1.7 times greater risk of interventions, a 2.6 times greater risk of life-threatening complications, and a 4.9 times greater risk of acute myocardial infarction. This prediction scheme was further improved by assigning \"high\" risk to any patient requiring an acute intervention during the initial evaluation in the emergency department. Otherwise, risk was assigned according to the ECG category, with normal, abnormal, and positive ECGs corresponding to \"low,\" \"intermediate,\" and high risk, respectively. Hospitals with limited intensive care beds may be able to use these prediction rules as an aid in determining in-hospital disposition of patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction.\r"

We employed data from a post-marketing surveillance trial following the introduction of a triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide (Maxzide) combination to estimate the frequency. In patients normokalemic at baseline, hyperkalemia developed with a frequency of 0.59% in 20,809 nondiabetics and in 1.08% of 922 diabetics. Hyperkalemia was threefold to fivefold more likely in those more than 60 years of age, and all of the excess hyperkalemia in diabetics occurred in the elderly. The severity of hyperkalemia was not influenced by the diabetes mellitus. Hypokalemia occurred with a frequency of about 5% and was not influenced by either age or diabetes. In patients who were hypokalemic prior to treatment, hypokalemia was corrected in more than two thirds and hyperkalemia occurred less frequently. Although hyperkalemia indeed occurs with increased frequency in the elderly diabetic when a potassium-sparing combination is employed, the frequency is not so great that such agents should be avoided routinely when their use could be beneficial. Renal function and serum potassium concentration should be assessed prior to instituting treatment and repeated within a few days and a few weeks thereafter in the patient at risk, especially when renal function is suspected, and in the elderly.\r"

The duration of immunity in these immunocompromised patients, however, is not known. To determine this, we studied 78 hemophiliacs prospectively 2, 3, and 4 years after the initial vaccination with a plasma-derived vaccine given as three monthly injections followed by a fourth booster injection at month 14. The duration of immunity clearly depended on whether the patients were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In HIV seronegative hemophiliacs (n = 67), there was a progressive decline in titers of antibody to the hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), but antibody was still detectable 4 years later in all of them. From the curves of decline of antibody titers, it appears that there is no need to revaccinate patients for at least 5 to 6 years. The HIV seropositive hemophiliacs (n = 11) not only started from much lower anti-HBs titers, but 5 of 11 lost anti-HBs. None of the 45 patients treated with concentrates during the postvaccination period developed serologic signs of hepatitis B, even though 6 of them had come into contact with live or inactivated hepatitis B virus as shown by the occurrence of spontaneous anamnestic antibody responses. This vaccine and schedule of vaccination afford a prolonged duration of immunity in HIV seronegative hemophiliacs, but HIV seropositive hemophiliacs have a risk of losing immunity early.\r"

Most episodes were caused by Haemophilus influenzae, and the overall response rate to treatment was 72%. Factors including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcoholism, prior splenectomy, and neutropenia did not play an important role in these patients' infections. Most of the isolates serotyped were found to be nontypable. The occurrence of ampicillin resistance was 6% throughout the study. Ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and second-generation cephalosporins were all effective therapeutic regimens. Bacteremia due to Haemophilus species remains an uncommon infection in patients with cancer, despite the predominance of traditional predisposing factors.\r"

Trimethoprim decreased the mean (+/- SD) renal clearance by 45% after the dose of procainamide was administered (487 +/- 129 vs 267 +/- 123 mL/min) and that of N-acetylprocainamide by 26% (275 +/- 78 vs 192 +/- 82 mL/min) compared with placebo. The mean area under plasma concentration--time curve 0 to 12 hours after dosing increased 39% for procainamide (19.8 +/- 4.8 vs 27.6 +/- 7.2 mg.h/L) and 27% for N-acetylprocainamide (9.1 +/- 2.1 vs 11.4 +/- 2.8 mg.h/L). The corrected QT electrocardiographic interval at 2 hours after the procainamide dose was 0.40 +/- 0.02 second with placebo and 0.43 +/- 0.03 second with trimethoprim. Trimethoprim may increase procainamide and N-acetylprocainamide plasma concentrations, resulting in increased pharmacodynamic response apparently caused by the competition for renal tubular cationic secretion.\r"

Biopsy specimens were examined for urease activity and for the presence of C pylori by culture and by histologic examination of hematoxylin-eosin- and Warthin-Starry-stained sections. Sixty-two patients were entered into the study. All esophageal biopsy specimens, regardless of histologic findings, were negative for the presence of C pylori by urease test, culture, and histologic examination. Of 35 patients with normal esophageal biopsy specimens, 11 (31%) had antral specimens that were positive for C pylori, while 11 (41%) of the 27 patients with esophagitis had antral specimens that were positive for the organism. Campylobacter pylori was detected in 14 (70%) of 20 patients with chronic gastritis, in 8 (67%) of 12 patients with endoscopically documented duodenal ulcers and erosions, but in only 3 (33%) of 9 patients with endoscopically defined duodenitis. We conclude that histologic esophagitis is not associated with increased prevalence of either gastric or esophageal C pylori. The well-described association of chronic gastritis and duodenal ulcers with C pylori was present in our study population.\r"

We performed a case-control study comparing 37 patients colonized or infected with resistant enterococci with 84 patients with susceptible strains. Crude odds ratios were significant for nosocomial acquisition, duration of hospitalization, hospitalization on the medical service or in an intensive care unit, number and duration of antibiotics received, and receipt of several individual antibiotics. By logistic regression, hospitalization longer than 2 weeks (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 17) and receipt of five or more antibiotics (odds ratio, 26; 95% confidence interval, 2.8 to 250) were significantly associated with colonization or infection with resistant enterococci. Patients with these latter two risk factors may be targeted in infection control efforts.\r"

In 88 patients (mean age, 80 +/- 8 years) who underwent percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty, the average initial aortic valve area was 0.48 +/- 0.20 cm2, and it increased to 0.74 +/- 0.26 cm2 after dilation. The average duration of follow-up in survivors was 7.8 months. Actuarial survival at 6 and 12 months was 75% and 63%, respectively. Factors associated with subsequent death included more severe impairment from heart failure at baseline, smaller initial aortic valve area, smaller final aortic valve area, low baseline cardiac output, and low ejection fraction. Among the surviving patients, 50% had no cardiac symptoms, and 85% had improved symptoms from congestive heart failure. Percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty is associated with continued increased mortality during follow-up, although symptomatic improvement in survivors is good. Percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty can be considered a palliative approach for severely symptomatic patients at high risk for aortic valve operation or patients with a limited life span due to other medical problems, but it is not indicated in patients at acceptably low risk for aortic valve replacement.\r"

The patient with diabetic ketoacidosis had a phosphate level nadir that equaled the lowest recorded phosphate level in a living human (0.03 mmol/L). Because (1) serum phosphate levels do not reflect total body phosphate stores, (2) rapid shifts of phosphorus can occur among body compartments, and (3) severe hypophosphatemia is potentially life-threatening, phosphate levels should be frequently monitored during therapy for hyperglycemia and intervention should be undertaken if phosphate levels fall below 0.5 mmol/L.\r"

After hospitalization, vancomycin and gentamicin sulfate were administered empirically. Immediately thereafter, her temperature rose to 40 degrees C, and over the ensuing 24 hours, eosinophilia and a maculopapular rash developed that resolved entirely when antibiotic therapy was stopped and low-dose steroid therapy was instituted. The prolonged hypersensitivity reaction after a single dose of vancomycin is consistent with the greatly extended half-life of this drug in the population with end-stage renal disease and should alert physicians to the possibility of such persistent idiosyncratic reactions in this group.\r"

Intermittent subcutaneous administration of octreotide suppressed growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels and ameliorated clinical symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging performed after 16 weeks revealed a 70% shrinkage of the pituitary mass, with a resultant partially empty sella turcica. To document that this shrinkage occurred as a result of octreotide treatment and not spontaneous tumor infarction, the medication was withdrawn for 4 weeks. A second magnetic resonance image disclosed regrowth of the tumor accompanied by rebound of growth hormone and IGF-I secretion. Subsequent biochemical remission has been sustained with preservation of anterior pituitary function since the drug was reinitiated. These findings suggest that intermittent subcutaneous administration of octreotide may provide potent medical ablation of growth hormone-secreting macroadenomas.\r"

The organisms described here are similar to Methylobacterium mesophilicum (Pseudomonas mesophilica) and the \"unnamed taxon\" organisms. A major difference from M mesophilicum is the lack of methanol utilization. Further distinctions between our isolates and M mesophilicum are the lack of flagella in our organisms, growth at 42 degrees C, growth on MacConkey's agar, lack of acetamide assimilation, and citrate utilization. The lack of flagella is the principle difference between our isolates and those in the unnamed taxon. Both of the isolates were resistant to the cephalosporins, but susceptible to the aminoglycosides, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and imipenem. With the growing population of immunocompromised and chronically ill patients, these organisms may emerge as important pathogens.\r"

In the other three subjects, doses of 80 to 100 micrograms induced severe anxiety, but no panic-like attack. All subjects experienced severe gastrointestinal symptoms. Pretreatment with lorazepam, but not with meprobamate or naloxone, prevented the psychic effects of cholecystokinin-4 in subjects who had experienced a panic-like attack with the same dose of this peptide. Following the peptide injection, levels of plasma free catecholamines, lactate, and glucose were unchanged, whereas levels of plasma cortisol and prolactin were increased. The intravenous injection of the sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (26-33) in two subjects (doses of 35 and 40 micrograms, respectively) produced severe gastrointestinal symptoms, but failed to induce any anxiety or panic-like attacks. These preliminary findings suggest that cholecystokinin-4 may have a panic-inducing effect.

  ".W": "No previous study of Alzheimer's disease has, to our knowledge, assessed the effect of both age at dementia onset and gender on cerebral glucose metabolic patterns. To this end, we used positron emission tomography (fludeoxyglucose F 18 method) to study 24 patients with clinical diagnoses of probable Alzheimer's disease. Comparisons of the 13 patients with early-onset dementia (less than 65 years of age) with the 11 patients with late-onset dementia (greater than 65 years of age) revealed significantly lower left parietal metabolic ratios (left posterior parietal region divided by the hemispheric average) in the early-onset group. The metabolic ratio of posterior parietal cortex divided by the relatively disease-stable average of caudate and thalamus also separated patients with early-onset dementia from those with late-onset dementia, but not men from women. Further comparisons between sexes showed that, in all brain regions studied, the 9 postmenopausal women had higher nonweighted mean metabolic rates than the 15 men from the same age group, with hemispheric sex differences of 9% on the right and 7% on the left. These results demonstrate decreased parietal ratios in early-onset dementia of Alzheimer's disease, independent of a gender effect.\r"

  ".W": "The serotonin agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) was administered intravenously to 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease and ten age-matched controls. It produced distinct behavioral effects in both treatment groups; however, significantly greater responsivity to mCPP was found in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in measures of psychomotor activation, restlessness, and perceptual abnormalities. Significant and similar increases in plasma prolactin and cortisol levels were found in both patients with Alzheimer's disease and controls following the administration of mCPP vs placebo. Furthermore, blood pressure and pulse changes following mCPP were not significantly different between the groups. Elderly controls, however, did show a significantly greater temperature response following mCPP than did patients with Alzheimer's disease. The overall cognitive effects of mCPP were minimal; however, mCPP produced significantly greater worsening in recent memory and knowledge memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls. These findings could not be explained by pharmacokinetic differences across populations, because plasma concentrations of mCPP were similar in patients with Alzheimer's disease and controls. The increased behavioral responsivity but unchanged neuroendocrine or other physiologic responsivity to mCPP may be related to damaged brain serotonin neurons or other neuronal systems that interact with serotonin neurons that have been found in postmortem and biopsy studies of patients with Alzheimer's disease.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence that excessive cortisol secretion in depressed patients might result, in part, from an enhanced adrenocortical sensitivity to corticotropin. This phenomenon has been examined using the cosyntropin (alpha1-24-corticotropin) stimulation test. Most studies have used supramaximal doses of cosyntropin administered in the morning, when adrenal sensitivity to corticotropin is at its maximum. This could partially obscure subtle differences in adrenocortical sensitivity in depression that might otherwise be evident at lower cosyntropin doses given later in the day. To test this hypothesis, we administered two consecutive cosyntropin tests on separate occasions employing a submaximal 0.05-microgram/kg dose and a maximal 0.2-microgram/kg dose. The cortisol centered cumulative response over 240 minutes was measured after each test in 12 depressed patients (7 melancholic, 5 nonmelancholic) and 6 healthy volunteers. When the difference in mean cortisol centered cumulative response values was determined, healthy controls demonstrated a significant increase in cortisol centered cumulative response, while the nonmelancholic patients had a less robust increase in cortisol centered cumulative response. In contrast, the melancholic patients demonstrated cortisol responses similar to those of the healthy subjects after each cosyntropin dose, suggesting an enhanced adrenocortical sensitivity to corticotropin. These data support the hypothesis that increased glucocorticoid secretion in depression may result from abnormalities at several sites within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, there has been considerable interest in plasma concentrations of homovanillic acid (HVA) in various psychiatric disorders. Homovanillic acid is a weak organic acid, and its excretion probably resembles that of other organic acids (eg, p-aminohippuric acid) that are actively secreted by the kidney. Alterations in renal plasma flow can affect clearance of organic acids, resulting in changes in plasma concentrations. In our study, concentrations of plasma HVA and urinary HVA (from 24-hour urine collections) were measured in 20 prepubescent boys who received 3 weeks of placebo, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and fenfluramine hydrochloride in a randomized, double-blind, counterbalanced study of the treatment of attention-deficit disorder. Plasma HVA concentrations were significantly lower during fenfluramine treatment than during amphetamine treatment. This difference, however, seemed to be caused by alterations in renal clearance of HVA rather than changes in production. Whole-body production of HVA, as indexed by total urinary HVA excretion, was unaffected by the different treatments, while renal clearance of HVA did differ significantly between amphetamine and fenfluramine treatment. It seems that alterations in renal clearance can affect plasma HVA concentrations, which should be taken into account when plasma HVA is studied.\r"

The magnetic field data were used in estimating the location, orientation, and depth of the source generating the 100-millisecond latency evoked field component (M100). The M100 latencies were slightly shorter than simultaneously recorded vertex electroencephalographic evoked potential N100 latencies, suggesting that magnetoencephalographic and electroencephalographic recordings were examining slightly different aspects of the source(s). The M100 sources demonstrated substantial interhemispheric asymmetry in normal controls, and were located more posteriorly, with more nearly vertical orientations, over the left hemisphere. The M100 sources in schizophrenics did not exhibit the same interhemispheric asymmetry. Left hemisphere source orientation differed significantly between normal controls and schizophrenics. Discriminant function analysis correctly classified normal controls and schizophrenics at 100% using the conservative jackknife procedure on the basis of left hemisphere orientation alone. Our findings, while preliminary, support altered left hemisphere function, or possibly structure, in this group of schizophrenic subjects, and suggest that magnetoencephalographic recordings may be a useful research method in this major mental illness.\r"

Statistical comparisons of men and women were also made with regard to the prevalence of each diagnosis, and the results were compared to published DSM-III diagnoses prevalence data for mixed chronic pain patients and rheumatology fibrositis patients. In our sample, women with fibrositis were equally as likely as men with fibrositis to have current depression. Within the general chronic pain population, women are more likely to have current depression. The incidence of current major depression and current and past major depression was much lower in our fibrositis sample than that reported by rheumatology programs. These results indicate that there may be psychiatric differences between chronic pain patients with and without fibrositis. Fibrositis patients in rheumatology programs may also be psychiatrically different from chronic pain program patients with fibrositis.\r"

All but three of these patients were ambulatory with a walkerette or cane when discharged to their homes. The commonest causes of blindness were macular degeneration, cataract, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. Despite being older (mean age 79.7 years compared to 70.4 years for all 191 admissions) and having visual impairment superimposed on their primary rehabilitation diagnosis, these patients' lengths of stay (LOS) were not prolonged (mean LOS = 33.1 days compared to 35.9 days for all 191 admissions). It is concluded that severe visual impairment is not uncommon among rehabilitation inpatients, particularly those aged 70 or older. Health care professionals working in rehabilitation should become more familiar with, and proficient in, the basic principles and treatment techniques used in the rehabilitation of visually impaired persons.\r"

  ".W": "Immediately after the trauma, spinal cord injury patients have an increased rate of collagen synthesis and an even greater increase of collagen degradation. Collagen lost from bone is implicated in the etiology of osteoporosis and heterotopic ossification, and collagen lost from skin might lead to a propensity to develop pressure ulcers. The urinary excretion of two collagen metabolites has been monitored and their fluctuation related to the onset of skin or bone complications in these patients. One metabolite, glucosyl-galactosyl hydroxylysine, is more abundant in skin collagen; the other, galactosyl hydroxylysine, is more abundant in bone collagen. The excretion of both metabolites increases after injury, reaching a peak between three and six months after injury, and declines gradually, reaching control values about a year after injury. If a skin pressure ulcer develops, the urinary excretion of the diglycoside remains elevated instead of gradually decreasing. Similarly, if osteoporosis or heterotopic ossification is diagnosed, the monoglycoside excretion does not return to control values until the bone turnover stabilizes. Monitoring of the urinary excretion of both glycosides might prove helpful in prompting early examination to establish the presence of emerging skin and bone complications. Thus, aggressive preventive therapy could be given sooner.\r"

Twelve healthy women volunteered to ambulate for one kilometer at their self-selected speeds for each of the three activities. Before the ACW test, the subjects completed one or two training sessions to familiarize themselves with this mode of ambulation. Standardized instruments were used to monitor the cardiorespiratory variables, and perceptual responses were recorded using the Borg scale for ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). The results indicated that walking was the least stressful of the three activities. Comparisons between ACW and running revealed that although the steady-state heart rate and minute oxygen consumption were significantly higher during running (173.5 vs 168.6 beats/min and 2.05 vs 1.06 L/min for running and ACW, respectively), the net metabolic cost per unit distance traveled was significantly higher during ACW (1.77 vs 1.01 kcal/kg/km) because of the longer time taken to ambulate the one-kilometer distance. The other variables studied--the oxygen pulse, ventilatory equivalent for oxygen, and RPE--also clearly indicated that ACW was the most stressful activity. Based on these limited observations, it is suggested that special precautions be taken when prescribing axillary crutches to women who have significant cardiorespiratory problems but are unaware of them, or to cardiac patients because of their coronary insufficiency.\r"

This is an often overlooked but important fact which significantly impacts the outcomes of their rehabilitation, especially where prosthetic ambulation is attempted. This study reviews the rehabilitation outcomes of 46 patients with the dual disability of hemiplegia and amputation. The mean age of the patients was 63 years (range 49 to 84). Forty-one (89%) could participate in a trial of physical therapy, and 25 (54%) in a comprehensive rehabilitation program. Seventeen (37%) were fitted with a prosthesis, and 12 (26%) became independent ambulators. Eighteen (39%) achieved independence in their activities of daily living (ADL) and transfers. Patients were reviewed to establish those features predictive of a good outcome. The following factors were associated with regaining independent ambulation: the presence of a mild hemiparesis with residual hand function (p less than 0.001), a below-knee amputation (p less than 0.01), and a history of ambulation before the second disability (p = 0.05). The ADL independence was associated with a mild hemiparesis (p less than 0.001), and age less than 60 years (p less than 0.05). Incontinence of bowel or bladder was strongly predictive of failure to achieve independence in either ADL or ambulation (p less than 0.001). Of those patients who did achieve independent ambulation, 73% were still ambulating a mean of 16.5 months later. These findings should be considered when planning rehabilitation goals for patients with the dual disability of hemiplegia and amputation.\r"

Sensors, affixed to the skin over T12 to L1 interspace and over the sacrum at the level of S1, were directly interfaced with an IBM PC-AT microcomputer, which was used for error-free collection and storage of data. Measurement results compared favorably to those obtained from the biplanar radiographic technique. Statistical analysis showed an extremely high degree of intraobserver and interobserver reliability. Additional advantages included simplicity and noninvasiveness. Overall, the magnetic field technique proved a significant advancement in clinically quantifying spinal mobility, allowing precise determination of impairment under American Medical Association guidelines.\r"

The patient was started on subcutaneous heparin. After 18 days of hospitalization, she developed marked thrombocytopenia and a massive venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity. On intravenous heparin therapy, the platelet count continued to decline. The thrombocytopenia resolved with discontinuation of heparin.

There were three independent predictors of days hospitalized (greater age, fewer years of education, and more days hospitalized during the previous year), three predictors of days hospitalized for those hospitalized only (greater age, fewer years of education, and longer hospital LOS during the previous year), one predictor of LOS (self-assessment of health), three of emergency room (ER) visits (more unmet instrumental activities of daily living needs, lack of organizational memberships, and more ER visits during the previous year), and five predictors of outpatient contacts (greater age, less satisfaction with health care providers' expressions of concern for their health, lower frequency of leaving apartments, lower levels of life satisfaction, and nonparticipation in a managed medical care demonstration project). Many predictors of health services utilization are immutable. However, changes which facilitate social interaction and changes in the organization of health services may reduce certain types of medical care utilization by people with SCI.\r"

  ".W": "Nerve conduction velocity is the parameter most often attended to when performing nerve conduction studies, but amplitude and duration of the nerve potentials should also provide important information about the status of the nerve examined. This study compared the results of amplitude and duration measurement to nerve conduction velocity to determine whether or not the various parameters correlated. Using standard techniques, median nerve motor and sensory conduction studies were performed on 390 unselected patients. The results were analyzed and correlation statistics calculated between the parameters of velocity, duration, and amplitude. Amplitude and duration of evoked potential correlated relatively poorly with conduction velocity (r2 = 0.26). Sensory and motor fibers were often affected differently in cases with probable carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Proximal motor conduction velocity correlated best with distal evoked potential amplitude (r2 = 0.27) in the CTS cases. The use of residual latency appeared to add little helpful diagnostic information. It was concluded that different parameters measure different physiologic processes that are to a considerable degree independent of each other.\r"

Our mean overall postoperative mortality was 17%, but this rate could be decreased by performing elective operations on well-prepared patients. Over 80% of the deaths were related to systemic organ failures. Eighty-three percent of the survivors (96 patients) returned to their homes; 82% (94 patients) had normal activities for their age. The actuarial survival curve showed a 50% survival rate at three years, all tumoral stages included. These results support the view that surgery is a safe, valid option in the face of gastrointestinal tract tumors in the elderly.\r"

Results showed that dragging sutures over the torn edge of the foil package, permanently kinking sutures, or axially twisting them up to four times did not decrease tensile strength. Similarly, the tug exerted by operating room nurses on polypropylene sutures did not decrease their tensile strength. Two manipulations, however, did decrease breaking strength. The presence of a stray knot reduced suture strength 17%, and grasping sutures with DeBakey forceps decreased suture strength in a dose-dependent fashion. When experienced surgeons grasped sutures with forceps out of direct vision, their grasping forces were well below that which alters tensile strength. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that sutures that have acquired a stray knot should be discarded and that sutures should not be grasped with mechanical devices such as forceps.\r"

Seventeen patients had hyperplasia; 6 were wrongly diagnosed as adenoma, 3 had inadequate excision, 2 had supernumerary glands, and 6 had remnant hypertrophy. Three patients had recurrent carcinoma. Two had wrong diagnoses and 4 had uncertain diagnoses. Reoperation eliminated hypercalcemia in 71 patients (85.5%).

When injected intradermally, angiotropin induces, in dose-dependent fashion, angiogenesis associated with skin hyperplasia. We have developed a flap model with insufficient blood supply and a model for contraction-free defect healing in rabbit skin. We show that (1) local pretreatment with angiotropin can prevent flap necrosis and (2) dermal regeneration after wounding can be augmented by angiotropin. From these results, we conclude that angiotropin might be of use as an adjuvant to healing in surgery.\r"

To determine directly whether bacterial translocation occurs in man, we cultured mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) obtained at laparotomy from 42 patients, none of whom were clinically infected. Ten (59%) of 17 patients with intestinal obstruction (none of whom had necrotic bowel) had bacteria in their MLNs, in contrast to one (4%) of 25 patients operated on for other reasons. The most common bacteria cultured from the MLNs was Escherichia coli. Thus, it appeared that simple intestinal obstruction of the colon or small bowel in the absence of necrotic bowel was associated with bacterial translocation.\r"

These patients all underwent reclosure four days later. In a third group of patients (n = 14) abscesses had developed down to, but not through, the peritoneum. These patients received antibiotic treatment for four days and underwent reclosure a mean of 5 1/2 days later (range, four to eight days). No abscesses reappeared in any group and all wounds healed by first intention. Five patients healed totally, with minor defects, but there was no need for surgical intervention.

Eleven patients with this condition were treated with an ileocolectomy with primary anastomosis and closure of the duodenal defect after take-down of the fistula. In all patients, the duodenal tissues were free of pathologic evidence of Crohn's disease. The fistula was found to result from Crohn's disease limited to the ileocolonic segment or from anastomotic complications in some patients who had previously undergone ileocolonic resections. Satisfactory healing at the ileocolonic anastomosis and at the duodenal closure site occurred in ten patients; breakdown of the duodenal closure leading to sepsis and death occurred in one patient with an unusually large defect in the first portion of the duodenum. In most instances, these fistulas can be treated safely and adequately by resection of the diseased intestinal segment and simple direct duodenal closure. However, safe management of large duodenal defects may require the use of other methods, such as a serosal patch or creation of a duodenojejunostomy.\r"

The predominant site of infection changed from the burn wound to the lung, with pneumonia being the most common bacterial infection in patients whose wounds were treated as described. Effective topical control of bacterial proliferation and excision of the burn wound have resulted in replacement of invasive bacterial wound infection by nonbacterial burn wound infection. The apparent advantages of excision, particularly in large burns, may reflect only patient selection, since only those patients who are considered to be physiologically stable and able to tolerate the physiologic stress of excision are considered for operation.\r"

These are just some of the mechanisms that may cause pyloric obstruction and may result from decreased PGE2 levels. To evaluate this hypothesis, 17 patients with duodenal ulcer complicated by pyloric stenosis were examined. Biopsy specimens were obtained from the duodenal bulb, ulcer margins, gastric antrum, fundus, and gastric secretions. Prostaglandin E2 levels were measured and compared with those taken from the same areas during a second endoscopy in a later quiescent or exacerbated phase. During the active phase of pyloric stenosis, decreased levels of PGE2 were found in the gastroduodenal tissues and secretions were compared with levels found during convalescence. These level differences were statistically significant. A correlation between the severity of the clinical and endoscopic findings and the PGE2 levels was found. A further decrease in PGE2 levels in the second endoscopy were indicative of the presence of scar tissue, representing an irreversible obstructive peptic disease.\r"

The first group was given 20 mL/kg of lactated Ringer's solution (LR) over a ten-minute period, while the second group was given 10 mL/kg of HTS. Both groups were then given LR at 2 mL/kg/min until the mean arterial pressure reached 80 mm Hg. The HTS group achieved a more rapid rise in mean arterial pressure over the first ten minutes of resuscitation. During this period, the cardiac index increased significantly more in the HTS group when compared with the LR group. All animals in the HTS group developed an adequate urine output. Only two animals in the LR group developed an adequate urine output. Hypertonic saline solution markedly improved survival, and there were significant improvements in hemodynamics. This was accomplished with smaller volumes of resuscitation fluid and may prove useful under conditions where intravascular access is limited.\r"

This approach is advocated when the presence of a possible pancreatic injury is the only reason for a planned exploratory laparotomy.\r"

Four of these patients were women who were being treated for cervical carcinoma and one was a man with prostatic cancer. These patients were refractory to steroid retention enemas, iron therapy, and benproperine enema therapy. Treatment was accomplished using the argon laser with a 300-micron fiber passed via flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscope. The most proximal areas were treated first. One and a half watts at 0.5 pulses was used. Up to 50 pulses were delivered per therapy session. The fiber was placed in contact with the lesion and circumferentially for 0.5 cm surrounding each suspected area. Bleeding stopped in the four women after two sessions and in the man after four sessions.\r"

Moreover, close cooperation with the statistician in planning the trial and the statistical strategy for analysis is also critical. Suggestions are made to aid the clinician in setting up the most efficacious trial and reporting the results.\r"

Control brains contained few SPs without preferential distribution in any of the brain regions examined, while NFTs were found almost exclusively in the HPR. In brains from patients with AD, an inverse relationship of SPs and NFTs was found in the brain regions examined; SPs were preferentially in the neocortex and NFTs preferentially in the hippocampus. The specific activities of choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase were reduced in all regions examined, while no significant change in the density of muscarinic binding sites was observed in any region. Numerous NFTs were associated with an earlier age at onset, while the presence of SPs was related to the cholinergic deficit in AD. Earlier-onset (less than 67 years) AD was also associated with a qualitative difference in the regional distribution of NFTs compared with cases with a later onset. In the latter group, most NFTs were observed in the hippocampus, a distribution pattern similar to that observed with normal aging. In AD cases with an earlier onset, NFTs were more globally distributed in the neocortex and allocortex.\r"

Morphologic lesions were more asymmetrically distributed than deficits in the cholinergic enzymes. Neither cerebral hemisphere showed consistently higher densities of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, or lower levels of choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase. Deficits in the cholinergic enzymes tended to colateralize, while asymmetries of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles did not. Finally, left-right asymmetry in the density of senile plaques diminished with increasing neuropathologic severity, while similar evidence for diminishing left-right asymmetry of neurofibrillary tangle density or cholinergic enzyme activity with increasing severity was not found.\r"

Sixteen subjects (36%) developed idiopathic parkinsonism, and 12 subjects (27%) developed drug-induced parkinsonism; the chief clinical features of both types were bradykinesia and rigidity, but not resting tremor. The presence of parkinsonism was associated with global (rather than selective) cognitive impairment, as determined by psychometric testing, and with more rapid progression to advanced stages of dementia. The pathological correlates of clinical parkinsonism were heterogeneous in 10 subjects with Alzheimer's disease who were examined post mortem. Coexistent Parkinson's disease was observed in five cases and nonspecific nigral degenerative lesions were present in another three; however, two cases had neither histological changes nor reduced neuronal densities in the substantia nigra. These two cases suggested that extranigral lesions, possibly involving mesocortical dopaminergic pathways, may contribute to the development of parkinsonism in subjects with Alzheimer's disease.\r"

A double-blind, controlled study of fatigue treatment was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of amantadine hydrochloride in treating MS-associated fatigue. Since fatigue cannot be characterized by a single symptom or behavior, a variety of neuropsychological, behavioral, and self-report measures were used to monitor changes across different systems. According to patients' daily diary ratings, amantadine produced small but statistically significant improvements in fatigue across four of seven dimensions (overall energy level, concentration, problem solving, and sense of well-being). In addition, patients with MS who were taking amantadine performed slightly better on the Stroop Interference Test, an attentional measure of freedom from distracting information. Although retrospective reports by patients with MS did not confirm the degree of improvement recorded on a daily basis, the study's results suggested that amantadine may offer modest benefits in alleviating the day-to-day subjective experience of fatigue.\r"

  ".W": "Four patients had a characteristic motor paresis that was dramatically improved by sympathetic block. The cause of this paresis could not be determined by the usual neurological examinations. It was similar to reflex sympathetic dystrophy in that the patients experienced severe pain, swelling, coldness, and muscle atrophy in the affected limbs or other parts of the body in the course of their illness. However, the motor paresis could precede the pain or develop after the pain had disappeared. Even in the absence of pain, the motor paresis was exacerbated by sympathetic stimulation using epinephrine, norepinephrine (nor-adrenalin), or isoproterenol hydrochloride (Proternol) loading and was improved by regional intravenous infusion of reserpine or by sympathetic ganglion block. Loading with pilocarpine, atropine sulfate (Bosmin), and edrophonium chloride (Antirex) did not influence the paresis. This motor paresis is thought to be due to abnormally increased sympathetic tone and may be considered a motor form of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. However, motor paresis closely related to sympathetic dysfunction is quite a new condition that we call \"sympathetic motor paresis.\" This is important clinically because a long-standing effect can be expected from permanent sympathetic ganglion block with dehydrated ethanol.\r"

These patients developed a mean diplopia-free field of 51 degrees, with a diplopia-free field in the abducted field of 20 degrees. This procedure involved surgery on only two rectus muscles, but the results compared favorably with surgical strategies involving three rectus muscles. Thus, the risk of developing anterior segment ischemia was greatly reduced.\r"

  ".W": "It is often clinically important, but also often difficult, to make a definitive morphologic diagnosis of optic nerve hypoplasia in a young child. If, however, one can obtain a photograph of the fundus, including the optic disc, one can make a simple measurement of the horizontal diameter of the optic disc and make this diagnosis. To determine if the horizontal diameter of the optic disc on a 35-mm photographic transparency could be used to separate patients with optic nerve hypoplasia from normal individuals, I measured directly on the transparency the horizontal diameter of the optic disc image taken by a standard 30 degrees field fundus camera with X2.5 magnification in a series of 55 normal eyes, and in 16 eyes with clinically confirmed optic nerve hypoplasia. For the normal series of eyes, the mean optic disc horizontal image diameter was 3.88 mm, with a range of 3.44 to 4.70 mm. For the series of eyes with optic nerve hypoplasia, the mean horizontal diameter was 2.64 mm, with a range of 1.80 to 3.27 mm. There was no overlap between the normal control series and the pathologic series. In subjects with no major ametropia (less than 2.5 diopters of spherical or cylindrical refractive error), a 3.4-mm horizontal diameter optic disc image on a 35-mm transparency can be used as a clinical guide or dividing line for the diagnosis of optic nerve hypoplasia, larger nerves being considered normal and smaller nerves being considered hypoplastic.\r"

Six cadaver orbits and 25 dried skulls were examined to investigate possible causes of intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage. In this experimental model, monopolar cautery to the orbital roof did not cause cerebrospinal fluid leakage; however, cautery to preexistent foramina or experimentally created defects in the orbital bones did. In exenteration, monopolar cautery may transmit thermal energy through extant body defects in the orbital roof directly to the dura, resulting in its disruption. These defects may be congenital, tumor related, or iatrogenic. Alternative methods of hemostasis should probably be employed to control bleeding that occurs along the orbital roof during exenteration.\r"

In two of the cases, there was radiographic evidence of contiguous orbital inflammation associated with sinusitis. The inflammatory orbital process in these two cases was steroid responsive, but in one case recurrent inflammation occurred in response to steroid tapering. One patient suffered a complete loss of vision in the involved eye due to fulminant orbital inflammation and optic nerve dysfunction.\r"

It has also been suggested that a larger disc area might predispose an eye to glaucomatous damage. We investigated the possibility that clinically quantifiable differences might exist in optic disc parameters between normotensive white and black patients. Disc area, cup-to-disc ratio, and cup volume measured with a video-ophthalmograph (Rodenstock Optic Disc Analyzer) were significantly larger in blacks than in whites, while there was no difference in the disc rim area between the two groups. We derived a mathematical model of the optic disc that relates posterior displacement of the lamina cribrosa to the disc area, distensibility of the disc, and intraocular pressure.\r"

The overall success rate by three years was 70%; it decreased to 55% after six years and remained at this level thereafter. Altogether, there were 26 eyes that had controlled glaucoma for six to ten years. The favorable factors for success were age over 60 years (82%), pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (75%), and lower baseline IOPs (69.3%). Argon laser trabeculoplasty was found to be a useful means of treatment in low tension glaucoma.\r"

Measurements were obtained immediately after aspiration, and at 30 s and 10, 15, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, and 18 hours. A marked decrease in SF6 concentration, from 97% at 30 s to 76% at 60 minutes and 2% at 18 hours, was noted. The results were highly reproducible. Sulfur hexafluoride gas should be injected into the patient's eye as soon as possible after aspiration from the tank to ensure accurate concentrations.\r"

An argon ion pumped dye laser, operating at an emission of 675 nm, was used in a nonthermal mode to irradiate iris tumors in rabbits 24 hours after they received in intravenous dye injection (23 eyes). The effects of laser irradiation alone and dye alone were examined in ten control eyes. A threshold tumoricidal dose was established for photodynamic therapy with CASPc and laser irradiation. Vascular occlusion was produced in a well-circumscribed area corresponding to the boundaries of laser irradiation after CASPc injection. Tumors successfully treated with CASPc and laser irradiation were arrested in growth and exhibited no viable tumor cells on histologic examination. Control tumors continued rapid growth, unaffected by dye or laser. Our data indicate that CASPc demonstrates a strong photosensitizing effect on both tumor and normal tissue. These results suggest that CASPc is a potential photosensitizing compound that may be useful in the treatment of choroidal melanoma.\r"

Rabbits were killed immediately after ablation and at intervals up to 100 days. By slit-lamp microscopy, four rabbits at day 100 exhibited four clear corneas and four corneas had central, spotty, subepithelial haze. Light and electron microscopy documented corneal healing. In the early stages a transient acellular zone in the anterior stroma appeared over a period of three weeks, followed by an increased number of fibrocytes. In the corneas with opacification, focal areas of 20-microns-thick subepithelial scarring were present. An unexpected finding was transient damage to posterior stromal keratocytes and endothelial cells. The endothelium produced a layer of granular material that migrated anteriorly across Descemet's membrane. Immunochemistry at day 6 showed a marked staining for collagen IV, proteoglycans, fibronectin, and laminin.\r"

As there is no significant transfer of gas out of the eye during the ascent, the fall in absolute intraocular pressure could only be mediated by expansion of the bubble. The enabling mechanisms for expansion are choroidal compression, scleral expansion, and accelerated aqueous outflow.\r"
