  ".W": "As part of a consecutive series of 370 patients who underwent subtotal esophagectomy because of carcinoma of the thoracic area of the esophagus, between January 1965 and July 1988, in the Second Department of Surgery, Kyushu University Hospital, 42 patients (11.4%) with early stage esophageal carcinomas confined to the intraepithelium, mucosa, or submucosa were studied clinicopathologically. Of these 42, 26 (61.9%) had symptoms; slight dysphagia or chest discomfort was the most common symptom. The remaining 16 (38.1%) had no subjective symptoms. Endoscopic examination proved to be more useful than barium studies. Lugol-combined endoscopy was most effective in detecting the presence and spread of small malignant lesions of the esophagus. At the time of surgery, six patients with submucosal carcinoma of the esophagus had lymph node metastasis, and five died of recurrence. Described herein are the diagnostic features, clinicopathologic characteristics, and long-term results of these 42 patients with early stage, and 328 patients with advanced, carcinomas of the esophagus, detected and surgically treated in our clinics.\r"

  ".W": "The results of a 5-year experience with use of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in the management of locally advanced bile duct carcinoma are presented. Fifteen patients received IORT doses between 5 and 20 Gy for localized disease, which was either primary and resected with microscopic residual (2 patients), primary and unresected (10 patients), or recurrent (3 patients). Thirteen patients also received postoperative radiation therapy. The median survival of the 12 patients with primary disease was 14 months, with disease controlled in the porta hepatis in 5 of 10 evaluable patients. The three patients with recurrent disease survived 2, 9, and 11 months. There were two operative deaths, for an operative mortality of 13%. Acute and chronic complications are reviewed. Cholangitis is the most frequent in both categories. This aggressive approach in the therapy for advanced disease has an acceptable level of morbidity and may warrant the use of IORT as part of the management of biliary tract cancer.\r"

Twenty-one patients had preexisting symptomatic or recognized atherosclerotic disease. Twenty patients had one or more identifiable precipitating factors, including warfarin administration (4), angiography (15), angioplasty (2), intra-aortic balloon pump placement (2), vascular surgery (11), aortitis (2), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (1). These preceded the onset of symptoms by as many as 3 months, but usually by less than 3 weeks. Eight patients had peripheral CE alone. Fourteen patients had visceral CE. All 14 had renal CE that was characterized by abrupt deterioration of renal function after a precipitating event (13), evidence of concurrent CE to the lower extremities or other organs (10), accelerated hypertension (9), gross hematuria (6), or flank and back pain (3). Unusual presentations included one case each of spinal cord infarction, penile gangrene, adrenal insufficiency, and symptomatic splenic infarct. If patients with visceral CE survived after initial hospitalization, they often required dialysis and later hospitalizations because of complications. Premortem diagnoses were made in 18 patients: nine from surgical specimens and nine from biopsies (one kidney, eight muscle and skin). Attempts at definitive vascular surgery were possible in only two patients and successful in one. The challenges encountered in managing these patients' conditions are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Although adequate tissue oxygenation is essential to maintain cellular metabolism, the use of hyperoxia to improve oxygen delivery or to improve metabolic performance is controversial. For example, supplemental inspired oxygen is reportedly beneficial in the treatment of some experimental infections; however, oxygen therapy also has well-documented adverse side effects. To evaluate the effect of increased inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) in animals with fulminant sepsis, 117 Sprague-Dawley rats underwent cecal ligation and puncture. Animals were then exposed to an FIO2 of either 0.21, 0.4, or 0.8. Twenty sham-operated controls had no mortality with any FIO2. Increasing the FIO2 increased mortality from 70% to 85% in animals receiving 40% O2, and to 100% in those receiving 80% O2. Autopsies revealed mild pulmonary oxygen toxicity with 80% O2 exposure in both control and septic animals, but normal lung histologic appearance in animals receiving lower levels of oxygen. Arterial blood gases documented maintenance of oxygenation and ventilation. Thus, pulmonary oxygen toxicity does not appear to be the mechanism for increased mortality. Supplemental oxygen may worsen, rather than improve, survival after fulminant infection.\r"

  ".W": "We studied subarachnoid hemorrhage in the population of Rochester, Minnesota, for the 40-year period from 1945 through 1984. The average annual incidence rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage in Rochester has remained constant at approximately 11 per 100,000 population. Age-specific incidence rates increased with age. However, the average annual mortality rate for subarachnoid hemorrhage in Rochester has shown a decreasing trend, from 6.8 per 100,000 population in 1955-1964 to 4.3 in 1975-1984. It is likely that this is due to a decrease in case-fatality rates from 57% in 1945-1974 to 42% in 1975-1984 (p = 0.10). This decreasing trend was also evident in annual mortality rates from subarachnoid hemorrhage for US white men and women. The reason for the improved case-fatality rate is unclear, but it may be related to changes in management. The interval from onset of subarachnoid hemorrhage to surgery decreased from a median of 12 days in 1975-1979 to 2 days in 1980-1984, and of those who survived to receive medical attention, more patients received some form of medical treatment in 1980-1984. Whether either or both of these changes have led to the decrease in the case-fatality rate is uncertain.\r"

After controlling for ethnic origin, we found that incidence was higher only in men of Western origin, while the female rates were higher in women of Asian and North African extraction. The case-fatality rate was substantially higher in women in all ethnic groups. These differences, especially in relation to the case-fatality rate, have important implications for health services in relation to both possible preventive action and to management of the acute disease phase.\r"

To assess this further, we evaluated 121 consecutive patients with acute cardioembolic stroke. Forty-nine were therapeutically anticoagulated within 96 hours of stroke onset, and 41 received no anticoagulants within the first 2 weeks after stroke. These two groups did not differ significantly with regard to age, sex, severity of acute neurologic deficit, or spectrum of underlying cardiac disease. The incidences of clinically significant brain hemorrhage (2%) and early recurrent embolization (2%) were equally low in both groups. Our data suggest that acute acute anticoagulation may be employed safely in most patients with cardioembolic stroke but that such treatment does not clearly benefit this population as a whole.\r"

The presence of a collateral circulation during the first few hours after the stroke reduced the size of the final parenchymal brain damage in patients with middle cerebral artery stem-trunk occlusion. The collateral blood supply was more efficient in patients who had no significant stenosing lesions of the extracranial internal carotid artery. Our data confirm that the lenticulostriate arteries are end arteries not supplied by collateral blood vessels and suggest that lesions formerly thought to be caused by hemodynamic mechanisms (watershed infarcts) or arteriolar lesions (lacunar infarcts) may be due to middle cerebral artery occlusions.\r"

Age, blood pressure, and black race were other independent predictors of hemorrhagic events; higher blood pressure appeared to be a partial mediator of the relation between alcohol use and hemorrhagic events. Alcohol use was associated with lower hospitalization rates for occlusive cerebrovascular disease; an inverse relation was present in both sexes, whites and blacks, and for extracranial and intracerebral occlusive lesions. Other predictors of hospitalization for occlusive disease included age, blood pressure, smoking, blood glucose and total cholesterol concentrations, and baseline disease. Our data suggest that heavier drinking increases the risk of hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events, but that alcohol use may lessen the risk of occlusive lesions.\r"

  ".W": "In a consecutive series of 473 patients admitted within 72 hours after a subarachnoid hemorrhage, 91 (19%) had hydrocephalus on the initial computed tomogram. Consciousness was unimpaired in 25 of the 91 (28%). In 11 more patients acute hydrocephalus developed within 1 week after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Thirty-eight (8%) of all 473 patients subsequently showed clinical deterioration because of acute hydrocephalus; 11 of these 38 had fluctuations in the level of consciousness. Of the 66 patients with acute hydrocephalus and impaired consciousness on admission, 26 (39%) spontaneously improved within 24 hours. Ventricular drainage was performed in 32 (31%) of the 102 patients with acute hydrocephalus (7% of all 473 patients). Consciousness improved after ventricular drainage in 25 (78%) of the 32 patients. Ventriculitis developed in 12 of the 24 patients with external drainage, mainly after greater than 3 days of drainage, and in none of the eight patients with an internal shunt. Among the 340 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and no long-term tranexamic acid treatment, the frequency of rebleeding in patients with ventricular drainage (43% of 23) was significantly higher than in hydrocephalic patients without drainage (15% of 52 patients; chi 2 = 5.009, p = 0.025) and patients without acute hydrocephalus (20% of 265 patients; chi 2 = 5.521, p = 0.019). We conclude that spontaneous improvement occurs in half of the patients with acute hydrocephalus and impaired consciousness on admission, which is usually apparent within 24 hours, and that the outcome of patients who need ventricular drainage will improve if rebleeding and infection after insertion of the ventricular drain can be prevented.\r"

  ".W": "Hypothermia protects tissue function in ischemia. This study determined if selective brain cooling inhibits cerebral cortical lactate accumulation and thus accounts for imporved neurologic outcome after complete cerebral ischemia in dogs. The brain was selectively cooled (hippocampal temperature 33 degrees C) by nasal lavage with water at 5 degrees C. Control dogs received nasal lavage with water at 39 degrees C. Mean +/- SEM rectal temperature in both groups was 39 +/- 1 degree C prior to ischemia. Selective brain cooling before and during 10 minutes of cardiac arrest was associated with significantly improved neurologic function and 100% survival, whereas normothermic cardiac arrest produced marked neurologic dysfunction and 100% mortality. Cerebral cortical lactate accumulation was measured in a complementary series of dogs exposed to the same two treatments but with the addition of six cerebral cortical brain biopsies taken before, during, and immediately after cardiac arrest. Brain and rectal temperatures of dogs in the brain biopsy protocol were similar to those of dogs in the recovery protocol. There was no difference detected in cerebral lactate accumulation during ischemia between brain-cooled and control dogs. Thus, reduction in cortical brain lactate during ischemia cannot account for the postischemic functional protection afforded by preischemic selective brain cooling.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of our study was to determine in rats the dependence of constrictor responses of intracerebral (parenchymal) penetrating arterioles on extracellular calcium. Vessel diameter was monitored in vitro, after spontaneous tone had developed. When the organ bat solution was changed from a physiological solution to a Ca2+-free one containing 0.5 mM EGTA, these vessels showed rapid and marked vasodilation to a mean +/- SEM of 159.8 +/- 8.2% of control (p = 0.018). After 3 minutes of pretreatment with Ca2+-free solution, constrictor responses to solutions of 140 mM KCl, pH 8.0, or 10(-4) M prostaglandin F2 alpha, were completely abolished, except for small transient contractions with the latter (6.6 +/- 1.8%). When vasoconstrictors were applied simultaneously with the Ca2+-free solution, all vessels still dilated to 159.8 +/- 8.4% (KCl), 146.7 +/- 6.1% (pH 8.0), and 124.3 +/- 9.1% (prostaglandin 2 alpha) of control (p = 0.018). Our results suggest that both vasomotor tone and constrictor responses in intracerebral arterioles are highly dependent upon activation from an extracellular calcium source.\r"

Changes in regional cerebral blood flow in the striatum were also assessed by means of a temperature-controlled thermoelectrical device. Peak 2 increased by 600-900% during 30 minutes of four-vessel occlusion, which may have reflected an ischemia-provoked increase in the release of dopamine and a disturbance in the outward transport of its metabolites. Following reperfusion by discontinuation of carotid occlusion, peak 2 rapidly decreased to below control values and then gradually increased, exceeding control values at 180-210 minutes after reperfusion. REgional cerebral blood flow in the striatum decreased to almost 0 ml/100 g/min during the ischemic period, transiently increased to greater than control values after reperfusion, then gradually decreased during the next 240 minutes. Since dopamine is known to have various effects on cerebral metabolism and blood flow, alterations in its behavior may contribute to changes in cerebral blood flow and to postischemic brain damage. In vivo voltammetry may be useful in the investigation of the pathophysiology of brain ischemia.\r"

  ".U": "89267805\r", 
  ".W": "Using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model in cats, we evaluated the possible role of the cyclooxygenase pathway in alterations of local cerebral blood flow and the development of cortical edema following prolonged ischemia or recirculation. We divided 57 cats into three groups, and each cat received saline (control), indomethacin, or the free radical scavenger ONO-3144. Each group was subdivided into prolonged ischemia (4 hours of occlusion: PI) and recirculation (2 hours of occlusion followed by 2 hours of recirculation: RC) subgroups. We compared local cerebral blood flow and cortical specific gravity between the PI and RC subgroups of the control and drug-treated groups. In the PI subgroup, indomethacin did not influence the time course of local cerebral blood flow but significantly worsened the decrease in cortical specific gravity. On the other hand, indomethacin significantly improved postischemic hypoperfusion and ameliorated the decrease in cortical specific gravity in the RC subgroup. The effects of ONO-3144 were similar to those of indomethacin, except that ONO-3144 did not affect cortical specific gravity in the PI subgroup. Indomethacin inhibits cyclooxygenase activity, whereas ONO-3144 scavenges the oxygen-centered radical released in the conversion of prostaglandin G2 to prostaglandin H2. Thus, prostaglandins do not seem to play a major role in the occurrence of brain edema due to prolonged regional ischemia. By contrast, oxygen-centered radicals released from the cyclooxygenase pathway appear to be at least partially responsible for the occurrence of recirculation-induced edema and postischemic hypoperfusion.\r"

The cerebrocortical electrical activity, extracellular potassium activity, and microcirculation indicated by NAD/NADH fluorescence were measured during occlusion as well as during recirculation in the core of the middle cerebral artery territory, while the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (ICMRgl) was measured at the end of recirculation. The cats were classified into either mildly or moderately severe stroke groups based on the depression of the cerebrocortical electrical activity on the occluded side. Of 12 cats with only a mild stroke, six were administered GM1 intravenously 30 minutes after occlusion, while six cats were not treated. Of 12 cats with a moderate stroke, six were treated and six were left untreated. In six additional cats, only a sham insult was undertaken. In the cats with mild stroke, GM1 treatment significantly increased lCMRgl in the peripheral middle cerebral artery territory compared with the untreated cats; for the six treated cats, lCMRgl was normalized toward the control level, whereas it was depressed in the six untreated cats. There were no other significant effects of GM1 treatment on the other measured parameters. A potential protective effect of anesthesia is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We explored the temporal and topographic relations between local cerebral blood flow and regional brain prostaglandin profile following prolonged or transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in cats. Each experimental group was subjected to a sham operation, prolonged ischemia, or recirculation. Local cerebral blood flow was measured by the hydrogen clearance method. Following in situ freezing, cortical samples were obtained from each gyrus for determination of prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha, PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane (TX) B2 concentrations by radioimmunoassay. During prolonged ischemia, the concentrations of PGF2 alpha and PGE2 within the middle cerebral artery territory were significantly increased. Immediately after recirculation, there was a prominent but transient increase in PGF2 alpha and PGE2 in gyri that had been exposed to moderate ischemia (perifocal area). By contrast, the increases in these prostaglandins were slow and less prominent in gyri that had been exposed to severe ischemia (the focal area). The concentration of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha did not change during prolonged ischemia but transiently increased following recirculation in both the focal and perifocal areas. The TXB2 concentration did not change in any experimental group. Our study revealed a homogeneous increase in the regional brain content of PGE2 or PGF2 alpha in spite of the heterogeneous reduction of local cerebral blood flow during prolonged ischemia. Following recirculation, the focal and perifocal areas exhibited different patterns of prostanoid content. No correlation was found between local cerebral blood flow and the regional concentration of any prostaglandin examined.\r"

Since previous work has implicated prostaglandins in the control of blood flow, we tested the hypothesis that a thromboxane synthesis inhibitor would improve cerebral blood flow and blunt the metabolic alterations that accompany asphyxia. Forty-three newborn beagles 2-7 days old were anesthetized, ventilated, and randomized to insult (5 minutes of asphyxia) or no insult and received treatment with either the thromboxane synthesis inhibitor CGS 13080 (CIBA-GEIGY Corp.) (0.06 mg/kg/hr i.v. infusion) or saline. Cerebral blood flow was measured in 25 pups. Pups received treatment 30 minutes before insult or no insult. In pups randomized to insult and receiving saline, cerebral blood flow increased during insult in the medulla but decreased elsewhere. Pups randomized to insult and treated with thromboxane synthesis inhibitor had increased cerebral blood flow during insult in all cerebral regions studied. In addition, these pups experienced a significantly higher incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage than did pups randomized to insult and receiving saline. In other experiments with 18 pups, brain extracts were prepared for proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectral analysis of high-energy phosphorylated compounds and lactate levels. In pups exposed to insult and receiving saline, mean +/- SD phosphocreatine concentration fell from 1.9 +/- 0.1 to 0.4 +/- 0.1 mmol/kg, lactate concentration increased from 2.0 +/- 0.5 to 3.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/kg, and the calculated pH fell 0.8 units. There were no differences between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Many are clinically silent, but some are associated with localizing symptoms and signs. Lacunes recently were classified into three types, namely, those resulting from small infarcts (type I), those arising as small hemorrhages (type II), and those due to dilatation of perivascular spaces (type III). The type II lacunes are thought to be much less common than those of type I. Type II lacunes have not previously been reported during life. We report a case of subacute type II lacune in the pontine tegmentum that was detected by magnetic resonance imaging and later verified by histopathologic examination. The patient was hypertensive and had numerous other type I lacunes. This case shows that the magnetic resonance imaging features of hemorrhagic lacunes are identical to those of small hemorrhages or small hemorrhagic infarcts and that magnetic resonance imaging is a useful tool in the detection of lacunes and their correlation with clinical neurologic symptoms and signs.\r"

  ".W": "Unsuspected malignant disease was discovered by frozen-section examination of the ureteral margins in 8 of 403 patients (2%) undergoing cystectomy for treatment of bladder cancer. Once malignant disease was demonstrated, a short segment of the proximal ureter was resected in 6 patients; in 5 instances dysplastic changes remained at the second margin, which was anastomosed to the bowel. No clinically recognized tumor developed at this site in any of the 8 patients. In an additional 26 instances (19 patients), dysplastic changes were known to be present in the ureteral margin at the time of ureteroenteric anastomoses. Again, no recognizable tumor has developed at the anastomotic site after a median follow-up of six years. We conclude that frozen-section examinations of the ureteral margins prior to constructing the ureteroenteric anastomosis are not indicated for the patient undergoing routine cystectomy for bladder cancer, but should be reserved for patients who are at increased risk for carcinoma in situ (those with multifocal bladder carcinoma in situ or transitional cell carcinoma of the prostatic ducts).\r"

  ".W": "There are many causes of urinary incontinence in the female, with stress incontinence reported as the most common. However, a high incidence of detrusor instability has been described in incontinent patients with Parkinson disease. To assess this further, urodynamic studies were performed on 17 female patients with Parkinson disease and complaints of urinary dysfunction. Detrusor instability was demonstrated in the majority of the patients (70.6%). Of the 8 patients with specific symptoms of stress incontinence, 2 were found to have a stable bladder, 3 had a hyporeflexic bladder, and 3 had detrusor instability. Surgical therapy may not be appropriate for all patients in this group. Since it is difficult to determine the causation of urinary incontinence on the basis of symptoms alone, urodynamic studies can be helpful in the evaluation of incontinent patients. This is especially important in female patients with Parkinson disease who may have detrusor instability alone or in addition to anatomic stress incontinence.\r"

The FFS physicians were more likely to consider behavioral risk factors important than were HMO physicians, and they were more likely to ask their patients about behavioral risk factors. Fee-for-service physicians were more likely than HMO physicians to use continuing medical education courses to upgrade their skills in modifying behavioral risk factors. There was little difference in the self-reported proportion of patients with specific behavioral risks in the FFS and HMO practices. Also, both groups were comparable in their perception of their ability to do behavioral counseling and their perceived success in such counseling. We conclude that FFS physicians are more likely to have positive preventive beliefs, attitudes, and practices than are HMO physicians.\r"

The percentage of physicians in underserved areas was higher than that reported in other studies and was much higher than would be expected if practice sites were selected on the basis of population distribution alone.

Previously reported pharmacokinetic data from 25 of 28 patients were used to simulate steady-state serum vancomycin concentrations for doses derived from the three methods. The Matzke method failed to provide simulated one-hour postinfusion levels less than 30 micrograms/mL in 48 percent and troughs greater than 5 micrograms/mL in more than 88 percent of the patients. The Moellering method succeeded in achieving this goal in 96 percent of the simulated one-hour levels, and in 72 percent of the troughs when a six-hour dosing interval was selected. For the 8 mg/kg Lake-Peterson doses, one-hour levels greater than 30 micrograms/mL occurred in 28 percent of the simulations, and for the 10 mg/kg doses this increased to 40 percent. The 8 mg/kg doses resulted in trough simulations less than 5 micrograms/mL in 28 percent and the 10 mg/kg reduced this to only 20 percent. These simulations indicated that the Moellering nomogram with the six-hour dosing interval was the most successful method for initial dose selection, but early serum concentration monitoring and adjustment of initial empirical and nomogram-derived doses is necessary to assure safe and effective vancomycin serum concentrations.\r"

Canister weight strongly correlated with number of activations for three different bronchodilators (metaproterenol, r2 = 0.9965; albuterol, r2 = 0.9984; terbutaline, r2 = 0.9913). To validate these results, a one-month trial designed to mimic patient use was conducted. Nine aerosol bronchodilator MDIs (three each of terbutaline, albuterol, and metaproterenol) were evaluated by three volunteers, each given one of each type of MDI. Number of activations were recorded in a diary and canisters were weighed weekly. At the end of the four-week period the number of activations were determined from weekly canister weight. Predicted activation numbers, calculated from both regression line and baseline weight, were compared to actual activation number. Statistical analysis was done using analysis of variance. Predicted number of activations for all three drugs ranged from 77 to 125 percent of observed and did not significantly differ depending on the type of bronchodilator (p = 0.3340). The method of prediction, regression intercept or baseline weight, led to significantly different predictions (p = 0.0569). The interaction between the method of prediction and type of bronchodilator was significant (p = 0.0197). Using either method, the actual number of doses dispensed can be predicted within 25 percent.\r"

Famotidine concentration was determined in the refrigerated samples immediately after compounding (time 0) and also on days 2, 4, 8, and 14 by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Famotidine concentration was determined by HPLC in frozen samples at time 0 and days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Solutions were also observed for visual changes and pH was tested at these time intervals. Results of the HPLC famotidine analysis demonstrated 94-107 percent recovery of famotidine in D5W and NS at 14 days in refrigerated samples and 98-100 percent recovery of famotidine in minibags frozen for 28 days then refrigerated for 14 days. Analysis of variance showed no time effect on the concentration of famotidine in refrigerated samples (p = 0.741). Linear regression of the frozen minibag data indicated no time effect.

A 53-year-old man underwent a gastrojejunostomy and was later intubated following the development of pseudomonal pneumonia. Midazolam was initiated in an effort to resolve his agitation and the patient continued to receive frequent bolus injections, averaging 22 mg/d over 21 days. Approximately eight hours after midazolam was abruptly discontinued, the patient became increasingly anxious and developed somatic complaints felt to be consistent with benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms rapidly abated upon the reintroduction of midazolam and the drug was ultimately tapered over a period of four days and discontinued without further incident. Implications derived from the association of long-term midazolam therapy with benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome are discussed.\r"

Follow-up evaluation is therefore needed, particularly when these drugs are \"restricted use\" medicines, such as the second-generation cephalosporins. We present a follow-up of the first use of cefonicid, which was carried out after its substitution for cefuroxime in our hospital. The indication for use, dosing, therapeutic effects, and possible adverse reactions were recorded in 210 of the first 319 medical-surgical inpatients who received cefonicid. Cefonicid was administered to patients who could have been treated with free-use antibiotics on at least 128 occasions; these were cases of community-acquired pneumonia without any risk factor, urinary tract infections, acute exacerbations in patients with chronic lung disease, surgical prophylaxis, and intraabdominal infections. One fatal case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome was seen. Other recorded adverse events were two skin reactions, one tachyarrhythmia with evidence of low cardiac output, six episodes of phlebitis, and nine superinfections during treatment with cefonicid. The use of cefonicid instead of cefuroxime was associated with 20 percent cost savings; however, this study shows that optimal antibiotic prescribing may produce much greater savings.\r"

A total of 319 hospitalized patients being treated for suspected or documented bacterial pneumonia were monitored, and this paper summarizes the data collected on this specific subpopulation. Two hundred three patients (64 percent) were treated for community-acquired pneumonia and 116 patients (36 percent) were treated for nosocomial pneumonia. Seventy-three percent of the nosocomial pneumonias were culture-positive, with a gram-negative microorganism as the predominant isolate. Forty-eight percent of the community-acquired pneumonias were culture-positive with a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Fifty percent of patients were treated with a single agent, 33 percent with two antibiotics, and the remaining 17 percent with a combination of three or more antibiotics. A satisfactory response was noted for 62 and 76 percent of the patients with nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonias, respectively. Twenty percent of the pneumonia patients were switched to oral drug after an average of five days of therapy and discharged from the hospital. Twenty-five adverse events that were possibly or probably related to the antibiotic regimen were reported in 23 of the 350 patients for an overall incidence of 6.5 percent. The results of this survey provide a cross-sectional view of antibiotic prescribing patterns for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia and the outcome of therapy under actual clinical conditions of use.\r"

These skills included the ability to read and interpret prescription labels, open and close vials, remove tablets, and identify tablet colors. The educational level and cognitive capacity using Jacobs' Cognitive Capacity Screening Examination (CCSE) was determined. The average age was 74.3 +/- 10.1 years. Eighty-nine of our participants were male. Age and educational level did not affect functional abilities. Fewer outpatients had problems interpreting prescription label directions than did inpatients. Patients who managed their own medications were more likely to be able to read and interpret labels, remove tablets, and identify colors (p less than 0.05). Patients with CCSE scores less than 20, indicating cognitive impairment, were less likely to correctly read and interpret labels and differentiate colors than patients without impairment. Motor skills (opening/closing vials, removing tablets) were not related to cognitive status. This functional tool was easily administered and was useful in the assessment of medication-taking skills in geriatric patients.\r"

With the completion of initial performance evaluation, revised pharmacokinetic parameter estimates derived in the initial evaluation are used to reevaluate program performance. The program uses population estimates of vancomycin's volume of distribution (Vd) and clearance (Cl) to initially predict dosing, then individualizes those estimates by a Bayesian algorithm (iterations) which uses dosing and the resulting serum vancomycin concentration data. Use of the Bayesian forecaster with one iteration significantly increases the calculated Cl value as compared with population estimates; two and three iterations significantly increase both Vd and Cl when compared with population estimates. Absolute values of the predicted minus observed peak serum vancomycin concentrations (accuracy) are 17.7 +/- 14.0, 6.1 +/- 3.6, and 3.4 +/- 2.1 mg/L for dosing using population estimates, Bayesian with one iteration, and Bayesian with two iterations, respectively. Similarly, accuracy of predictions for trough concentrations is 13.8 +/- 12.4, 3.5 +/- 3.2, and 3.2 +/- 2.6 mg/L for each method, respectively. Bias of dosing predictions in achieving desired peak and trough serum vancomycin concentrations is also significantly reduced by using the Bayesian algorithm. Use of the mean Vd and Cl values from three iterations as the starting parameters in a new group of 12 patients significantly improves program performance when compared with use of initial population parameters. Time of sampling for peak serum concentrations has no effect on program performance. In patients with impaired renal function, use of population estimates resulted in less accurate dosing prediction, but this less accurate performance was not observed with use of the Bayesian forecaster. These data demonstrate the accuracy and lack of bias in individualized dosing predictions using the Bayesian dosing method and the ability of revised pharmacokinetic parameter estimates to improve performance.\r"

Auxiliary prescription labels are a common, yet little studied method of providing drug information. We studied 4 groups of 20 patients aged 65 or older, who obtain prescriptions at community pharmacies. They received either auxiliary label(s), counseling, both counseling and auxiliary labels, or no supplementary information at all. Counseling provided the same information verbally as was provided on the labels. Patients were interviewed 3-15 days later. Sixty-six percent were able to read auxiliary labels without difficulty. Significantly more patients who received auxiliary labels, with counseling (65 percent) or without counseling (63 percent), were able to recall supplementary information correctly and completely compared with patients who did not receive supplementary information (25 percent). However, a significant improvement in understanding or ability to apply this information was not found. Counseling alone did not significantly improve either outcome. It was concluded that the use of auxiliary labels is a useful, although not ideal, method of providing drug information for elderly patients in a busy community pharmacy setting.\r"

We evaluated a two-point method to predict lithium maintenance dosages of slow-release lithium carbonate tablets in 20 bipolar patients using both assay methodologies. No clinically significant differences were found between the two sets of predictions, suggesting that either assay methodology has requisite sensitivity and accuracy for use in test dose predictions of lithium maintenance dosages.\r"

Due to the frequency of the medication administration (every six hours) and the apprehension of the family members, a Pharmacia-Deltec CADD-VT Infusion Pump was chosen for drug administration. Based on the stability of ampicillin, 1.3 g q6h was administered to provide a minimum of 1 g for the last dose of a 24-hour cycle. Ampicillin 6 g contained in 100 mL of sterile water for injection provided a 60 mg/mL solution with an osmolarity of 347 mOsmol. The pump was programmed to deliver 22 mL of solution over one hour, every six hours. A keep-vein-open rate of 0.2 mL/h maintained line patency. A 100 mL cassette of solution prepared daily was replaced on the pump by a home therapy nurse each morning. At the end of six weeks of therapy, the osteomyelitis was eradicated. We found the use of an ambulatory infusion pump an effective, convenient, and cost-saving method of treatment for our patient.\r"

The patient's platelet count dropped rapidly to a level of 1000/mm3 after receiving a single 600 mg dose of rifampin. After returning to a normal level of greater than 100,000/mm3, the patient's platelets again dropped to 1200/mm3 with readministration of rifampin. The long-term therapy necessary to eradicate the Mycobacterium tuberculosis organism makes economic considerations important. This patient and other indigent patients who may be poor compliers because they are unable to buy the necessary medication may be at a higher risk for adverse reactions.\r"

Forty-three and 123 serum levels were obtained in 8 adult depressive patients (aged 57-80 y) and 34 enuretic children (aged 5-13 y), respectively. Forecasting of the serum concentrations was performed based on mean population pharmacokinetic parameters (method A), with knowledge of one steady-state serum concentration (method B), and from two or more steady-state serum concentrations (method C). The accuracy and precision of each method were evaluated from the mean prediction error (ME) and from the root mean squared prediction error (RMSE), respectively. The values of ME and RMSE of methods B and C proved to be significantly lower than those found using method A. Method C was the most precise and accurate in both populations. Method A underestimates the serum concentrations observed in adults (ME greater than 0) but overestimates them in children (ME less than 0), although to a lesser extent. The study shows that it is possible to obtain a good estimation of individual dosage needs from one or more serum concentrations obtained at steady state. Clinical application of these methods (B and C) yields an increase in the efficiency and safety of the treatment, particularly in special populations such as geriatric and pediatric patients.\r"

Unexposed patient encounters were selected from encounters at the FPC immediately prior to each resident's exposure to clinical pharmacy services. A blind review panel evaluated case abstracts of the patient encounters for appropriateness of drug choice, daily dosage, dosing interval, duration of treatment, clarity of instructions, and monitoring data; potential severity of the patient problem; and difficulty of the clinical decision. After adjusting for covariables (potential severity, difficulty, patient age, sex, Medicaid status, therapeutic category, and type of medical problem), physician-patient encounters in which family practice residents were exposed to clinical pharmacy services were rated significantly more appropriate for choice of drug prescribed, daily dosage chosen, dosing interval selected, clarity of prescription instructions, and monitoring data. Costs of acute medications, as measured by average wholesale price per day, per dose, and per treatment course, were also significantly lower for clinical pharmacy-exposed physician-patient encounters.\r"

In face of a demand that could not be satisfied by commercial supplies of low-dose KI drug products from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, the Food and Drug Administration directed the manufacture and stockpiling of sufficient quantities of saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) to provide protection for one million people in the event of a large-scale release of radioiodines. Although the drug was not used, the experience of producing, stockpiling, and making ready for use a large quantity of the drug resulted in significant public policy, regulatory, and logistical issues. A number of these issues have been resolved through scientific debate and consensus, development of official guidance regarding the proper role of KI in nuclear emergencies, and the approval of New Drug Applications for KI products specifically intended for thyroid blocking in nuclear emergencies. Other issues regarding broad-scale implementation of the guidelines remain today. This paper traces the history of the development and implementation of the use of KI from pre-TMI to the present.\r"

It is possible that OFR could have effects on cardiac function and contractility. The present investigation deals with the effects of OFR in the absence and in the presence of scavangers of OFR (superoxide dismutase and catalase) on cardiac function, index of cardiac contractility, serum creatine kinase (CK), and blood lactate, PO2 and pH in the anesthetized dogs. The hemodynamic measurements and collection of blood samples for measurement of CK, lactate, PO2 and pH were made before and at various intervals after administration of OFR for 1 hour. Xanthine and xanthine oxidase were used to generate OFR. OFR produced a decrease in cardiac function and indices of myocardial contractility and an increase in the serum CK. OFR produced an increase in the systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Although there was a tendency for an increase in the blood lactate, the increase was not significant. The blood PO2 and pH were not affected. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), alone or in combination with catalase, tended to protect cardiac function against the deleterious effects of OFR. Scavangers of OFR prevented the OFR-induced rise in serum CK. Although the protective effect of SOD plus catalase was slightly better than SOD alone, the results were not significantly different from each other. These results suggest that OFR are cardiac depressant and increase the peripheral vascular resistance besides causing cellular damage. Scavangers of OFR may be beneficial in counteracting the deleterious effects of OFR on hemodynamic parameters and cellular integrity.\r"

Dipyridamole thallium tomography was performed 1 to 4 (mean +/- S.D. 1.5 +/- 0.9) days before and 1 to 25 (6.3 +/- 6.9) days after angioplasty. Coronary angioplasty was anatomically successful (less than 50% residual stenosis) in 23 of 24 patients. Before angioplasty, 3 of 24 scans were interpreted as normal, with no change in these patients following angioplasty. Prior to angioplasty, 19 scans showed redistribution. After successful coronary angioplasty in 18 of 19, 17 showed improvement in dipyridamole thallium scanning; one did not show improvement and later required repeat coronary dilatation. In one patient with failed angioplasty, images before and after angioplasty were unchanged. Nine scans showed \"fixed\" defects before angioplasty, with improvement in three of nine following angioplasty. Quantitative analysis of the dipyridamole thallium scans revealed significant improvement in uptake in the myocardial regions supplied by the successfully dilated artery (involved regions), but not in the remote (uninvolved) regions. We conclude that myocardial perfusion, as judged by dipyridamole thallium scanning, almost always improves following anatomically successful coronary angioplasty. \"Fixed\" defects may improve following angioplasty and presumably represent ischemia with incomplete redistribution, rather than infarction.\r"

Two hundred eight women with angiographically normal coronary arteries constituted the control group, and 137 with a 70% or more occlusion of one or more coronary vessels were classified as having severe coronary occlusive disease. Age-adjusted odds of severe coronary disease based on the logistic regression model for the risk factors evaluated were as follows: smoking, 5.73 (p less than 0.001); diabetes, 5.09 (p less than 0.001); cholesterol level greater than 240 mg/dl, 2.35 (p less than 0.05); a parental history of death from heart disease before age 60 years, 2.03 (p less than 0.05); and estrogen use for 6 months or longer, 0.50 (p less than 0.01). There were no differences with regard to the presence of obesity and a history of hypertension in women with and without coronary disease. These data support the hypothesis that use of noncontraceptive estrogen significantly reduces the risk of severe coronary disease, whereas smoking, an elevated cholesterol level, and a parental history of heart disease all increase the risk of ischemic heart disease in women.\r"

The aortic flow measurements were validated by comparison with left ventricular stroke volume in all subjects and by comparison with pulmonary flow measurements in 12. Agreement was good with standard errors of the estimate of 7.8 and 7.1 ml, and correlation coefficients of 0.93 and 0.95, respectively. Systolic velocity maps were similar in the proximal aorta and the mid-ascending aorta, with maximum early systolic flow along the left posterior wall. Toward the end of systole and throughout diastole, a channel of reverse flow developed in the same region in the mid-ascending aorta, but in the proximal aorta it split to enter the sinuses of Valsalva, predominantly the left and the right coronary sinuses. Mean percentage ratio of retrograde-to-antegrade flow was 6.3%, with the majority of retrograde flow occurring in early diastole. The findings suggest that the retrograde flow is related to coronary artery flow and it is possible that aortic disease, which is known to influence aortic flow patterns, may also influence coronary flow.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the relationship of conduction delay and monophasic action potential (MAP) at an ischemic border zone to serious ventricular arrhythmia (VA). Measurements were made in 36 adult mongrel dogs 15 minutes after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. We recorded MAPs and bipolar electrograms simultaneously inside and outside the ischemic border zone in the dog hearts. Of the 36 dogs, 24 that had favorable MAP recordings were chosen and were divided into two groups according to an occurrence of VA. In group A (n = 12), an onset time of VA was 5.1 +/- 0.8 minutes after ischemia, while in group B (n = 12) VA did not occur during ischemia. The conduction delay at the ischemic border zone was significantly greater from 3 minutes after ischemia in group A than in group B. MAP alternans, defined as the difference in duration of two consecutive MAPs inside the ischemic border, was marked in group A but mild in group B. Duration of a small MAP of alternans was markedly shorter than that of a corresponding MAP outside the ischemic border in both groups, but was followed by VA in group A. Duration of a large MAP was markedly prolonged compared with that of a corresponding MAP outside the ischemic border in seven dogs of group A and in only one dog of group B (p less than 0.01), and was followed by VA in seven dogs of group A. Our results suggest that the mechanism of VA is due not only to reentry but also to an injury current flowing from ischemic to nonischemic tissues, because VA was preceded by conduction delay and by a difference in MAP durations when comparing regions inside and outside the ischemic border.\r"

  ".W": "The safety and feasibility of performing catheter ablation of the ventricular septum with radiofrequency energy was assessed in a closed-chest canine model. Radiofrequency energy (750 kHz) was delivered in a bipolar manner via the distal electrodes of two quadripolar catheters positioned across the ventricular septum in 10 dogs at two sites. Each site received from 159 to 823 joules of delivered energy over one to three applications. Four additional dogs underwent unipolar radiofrequency ablation with 331 to 767 joules of delivered energy to each septal site. No significant acute or latent arrhythmias were noted. Dogs were killed at 1 day, and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the procedure. Out of a possible 40 potential ablation sites on each side of the septum after bipolar ablation, 21 (53%) discrete endocardial lesions were identified, ranging in size from 4 x 3 x 1.5 to 10 x 8 x 4 mm. When 352 joules or more delivered energy was applied per site, lesions were located at 18 of 28 (64%) possible sites. After unipolar radiofrequency ablation, similarly sized lesions were identified at 15 of 16 (94%) ablation sites. Histologic examination demonstrated well-delineated round or ovoid-shaped lesions with microscopic thrombi overlying two lesions. In conclusion, catheter ablation of the ventricular septum with radiofrequency energy appears capable of safely producing discrete areas of necrosis and may provide an alternative to direct current (DC) energy for catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia originating from the septum.\r"

TAP was unsuccessful in 18 cases (10%). All the patients tolerated the procedure well. A statistical elaboration with the Fisher exact test did not evidence a correlation between efficacy and age, sex, atrial cycle length, or underlying heart disease but showed a significant correlation between efficacy and AF duration of less than 1 day (p less than 0.05) and absence of antiarrhythmic pharmacologic pretreatment (p less than 0.01). These data strongly support the immediate first-choice use of TAP in AF therapy.\r"

Recordings were made from normal canine cardiac Purkinje fibers in major false tendons, from normal Purkinje fibers partially depolarized by treatment with Tyrode's solution containing 7 mmol/L potassium chloride, from subendocardial Purkinje fibers of the left ventricle of normal hearts, and from subendocardial ventricular muscle preparations. Diltiazem, 1 and 2 mumol/L, exerted local anesthetic effects and decreased the action potential plateau duration in normal Purkinje fibers. In contrast, diltiazem, 1 mumol/L, did not affect the action potentials of potassium-depolarized Purkinje fibers, subendocardial Purkinje fibers, or ventricular muscle cells. Diltiazem, 1 and 2 mumol/L, did not decrease normal or high potential automaticity or catecholamine-enhanced high potential automaticity in canine Purkinje fibers with maximum diastolic potentials greater than -80 mV. In contrast, diltiazem, 1 mumol/L, rapidly terminated low potential automaticity in barium-treated Purkinje fibers with maximum diastolic potentials of -40 to -60 mV. The local anesthetic effects of diltiazem, as well as the effect on low potential automaticity, can explain the antiarrhythmic effects of the drug.\r"

  ".W": "Magnesium salts have been used for decades for the empiric treatment of arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes, associated with long QT syndrome. The mechanism underlying this antiarrhythmic effect is still not clear. Therefore the effect of intravenous MgSO4 on serum electrolytes, blood pressure, and ECG variables was evaluated in nine patients with sick sinus syndrome, equipped with a DDD pulse generator, programmed in the atrial asynchronous mode. A total dose of 10 gm MgSO4 was given intravenously over 6 hours at a constant rate. Blood pressure and serum electrolytes were determined before (t0), 3 hours after (t3), and at the end of the magnesium infusion (t6). ECG variables were measured at t0, t3, and t6 at different pacing frequencies (60, 80, and 100 beats/min). Serum magnesium levels rose significantly from 0.88 mmol.l-1 at t0 to 1.91 mmol.l-1 at t6 (p less than 0.05). Magnesium infusion did not affect blood pressure, pulse rate, PR or QRS or QT interval. Increasing the pacing frequency resulted in a statistically significant QT shortening at each serum magnesium level. We conclude that intravenous magnesium administration does not influence the QT interval. Increasing atrial pacing rate shortens the QT interval and this QT shortening is not affected by magnesium. Sustained serum magnesium levels between 1.5 and 2 mmol.l-1 are hemodynamically well tolerated and do not give rise to the development of higher degree atrioventricular block.\r"

  ".W": "Studies that used prolonged contrast media infusion in canine arteries have generated controversy regarding the arrhythmogenic potential of low osmolarity, nonionic contrast agents. In order to establish the relative safety of these agents in the more typical setting of bolus injections, 4 ml intracoronary bolus injections of Hypaque-76 (n = 54), Iohexol-350 (n = 51), and Iohexol-140 (n = 51) were given in random order to 10 anesthetized, open-chest dogs undergoing programmed cardiac stimulation. Hemodynamics and electrocardiogram were monitored during stimulation, both during and for 2 minutes after the end of contrast infusion. Occurrence of evoked single and coupled premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia did not differ statistically among agents. Sustained ventricular tachycardia (five episodes) and ventricular fibrillation (seven episodes) occurred only after Hypaque-76 injections (p less than 0.002). These results differ from those in studies that use continuous contrast infusion and suggest that low osmolarity nonionic contrast agents are as safe as high osmolarity nonionic contrast media. Both appear safer than ionic contrast material.\r"

  ".W": "Although it is increasingly recognized that the density of cardiac membrane-bound beta adrenoceptors declines in heart failure, the mechanisms involved are unclear. Furthermore, it is not known whether cardiac alpha-1 adrenoceptors are similarly affected. Inasmuch as agonist-induced desensitization results in translocation of adrenoceptors from the plasma membrane to an intracellular vesicular fraction, we determined the intracellular distribution of cardiac adrenoceptors in two groups: group 1 (n = 9) consisted of papillary muscles from patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure undergoing valve replacement, and group 2 (n = 8) consisted of severely failing hearts removed during orthotopic cardiac transplantation. The density of cardiac beta adrenoceptors was lower in membranes from group 2 (17.8 +/- 3.3 fmol/mg protein vs 27.8 +/- 3.7 fmol/mg in group 1; (p less than 0.01), and the percentage of beta receptors recovered in the vesicular fraction was higher in group 2 (47.1 +/- 3.3% vs 36.8 +/- 5.0% in group 1; p less than 0.01). In group 1 but not group 2 there was a significant inverse correlation (r = -0.87; p less than 0.001) between the density of membrane-bound beta receptors and the percentage of beta receptors recovered in the vesicular fraction. Alpha-1 adrenoceptors were lower in both membrane and vesicular fraction of group 2 compared to group 1; in group 2 but not group 1 there was a significant negative correlation between the density of membrane-bound alpha-1 adrenoceptors and the percentage of alpha-1 receptors in the vesicular fraction (r = -0.8; p less than 0.01). These results suggest that the regulation of alpha-1 and beta adrenoceptors differs in the failing myocardium. Furthermore, agonist-induced desensitization may play a predominant role only in mild-to-moderate heart failure.\r"

They had severe left ventricular hypertrophy, small left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions, and supernormal ejection fractions. Thirty-nine percent had a history of hypertension. They were predominantly female, had uniform concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and had a high incidence of congestive heart failure. Diastolic function was found to be reduced in the elderly group compared to young patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and to age- and sex-matched normal controls. It is concluded that most elderly patients with increased left ventricular outflow tract velocities are etiologically distinct from young patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r"

A control group of 10 normal children was also studied longitudinally on two occasions. The exercise was performed on an upright bicycle ergometer using a continuous graded exercise protocol. Parameters measured were heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest, and these pressures at the maximal voluntary exercise level. In addition, a subset of patients and controls had measurement of cardiac output by a modified acetylene rebreathing technique. Results indicate that coarctation patients had significant elevation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures at rest (p less than 0.001 for both) and with exercise (p less than 0.02 for both) prior to surgery. The group mean values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not differ from control values after surgery; however, some individuals continued to have hypertension at rest when compared to population-based norms. Heart rate, cardiac index, and stroke volume index did not differ from those of control subjects either at rest or during exercise before or after surgery. In conclusion, a group of coarctation patients studied longitudinally demonstrated marked improvement in both systolic and diastolic hypertension after surgery. The findings of normal cardiac output and stroke volume indices may have implications for the etiology of postoperative hypertension.\r"

VSD size and shape by two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and at autopsy were compared in 18 patients, average age 6 months, who had 2DE studies shortly prior to death. Six had isolated VSD and the other 12 had additional cardiac anomalies. The maximal diameter of the VSD was measured in long- and short-axis views and the VSD area was calculated assuming an elliptical shape. A large VSD was present in 11 of 18 (61%) and was correctly detected by 2DE in 10 of 11 (91%, no false positives). 2DE-predicted area of VSDs correlated with autopsy measurements (r = 0.94). The shape and orientation of the VSD were correctly predicted by 2DE (16 of 18); it was elliptical in 13 and circular in five, with the major axis of the elliptical VSDs aligned with the short axis of the heart in eight and with the long axis in five. The diameters of the VSD ranged from 3 to 25 mm (r = 0.93). Diameters measured from the long-axis and short-axis views correlated with autopsy (r = 0.98 and 0.89, respectively). Thus: (1) 2DE was useful in distinguishing large VSDs from smaller defects, and in measuring their diameters and areas. (2) The shape and orientation of the VSD were well predicted by 2DE.\r"

Cross-sectional areas of the ascending aorta and proximal left and right coronary arteries, left and right ventricular mass, coronary artery dominance pattern, and the presence of discrete coarctation were determined from autopsy specimens. These values were used to construct survival functions using Cox regression. Survival was significantly prolonged in cases with larger cross-sectional areas of the left (p less than 0.005) and right (p less than 0.05) coronary arteries, right ventricular mass (p less than 0.005), and combined ventricular mass (p less than 0.005). A multivariate model was developed that included combined left and right coronary artery cross-sectional areas, right ventricular mass, and the ratio of combined coronary artery area-to-combined ventricular mass. This model also significantly (p less than 0.001) predicted instantaneous risk of death, and again larger covariate values were associated with longer survival. These results suggest that myocardial perfusion is an important determinant of survival in these infants.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-eight patients with acute myocardial infarction were examined by 3 clinicians who, independently of each other, gave an estimate of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF) in each patient. Their estimates were based on physical examination, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, patient history and clinical course during admission. Ejection fractions were estimated as belonging to 1 of 4 categories: normal (LVEF greater than or equal to 0.53, RVEF greater than or equal to 0.57), mildly reduced (LVEF 0.40 to 0.52, RVEF 0.45 to 0.56), moderately reduced (LVEF 0.30 to 0.39, RVEF 0.35 to 0.44) or severely reduced (LVEF less than 0.30, RVEF less than 0.35). Radionuclide ventriculography was carried out immediately after the physical examination. LVEF was correctly estimated in 43% of all examinations, deviated from radionuclide LVEF by 1 LVEF category in 45% and by 2 LVEF categories in 12%. The 3 clinicians agreed on estimated LVEF in only 32% of the patients. RVEF was correctly estimated in 67% of the examinations, but none of the clinicians identified greater than 43% of the relatively few patients with reduced radionuclide RVEF and they greatly disagreed as to who among the patients had a reduced RVEF. Previous myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic infarct location, Killip class, physical signs of left- and right-sided heart failure, radiographic pulmonary congestion and cardiomegaly were analyzed to determine which were the most helpful in predicting LVEF and RVEF. The results disclosed that several variables, traditionally believed to be reliable indexes of reduced ventricular function, were surprisingly poor predictors of LVEF and RVEF.\r"

In addition, the ability of dipyridamole-Doppler echocardiography to predict the presence of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) was evaluated. Baseline and post-dipyridamole Doppler studies were performed in 10 normal control subjects and 23 patients with CAD. Aortic peak velocity and acceleration increased from baseline to post-dipyridamole in normal subjects by 0.07 +/- 0.07 m/s (p = 0.016) and 2.1 +/- 2.0 m/s2 (p = 0.009), respectively. The ratio of early to late peak transmitral velocities decreased slightly in normal subjects, by 0.18 +/- 0.72 (difference not significant), whereas the ratio of early to late transmitral velocity-time integrals increased by 0.07 +/- 0.93 (difference not significant). The response of aortic velocity and acceleration to intravenous dipyridamole was not significantly different between normal subjects, patients without reversible thallium-201 perfusion defects and patients with reversible thallium-201 perfusion defects. Furthermore, only 3 of 14 subjects with reversible thallium-201 perfusion defects had abnormal (greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean) responses of aortic velocity or acceleration to intravenous dipyridamole. No patient had an abnormal response of the early to late mitral peak velocity ratio. In addition, the response of Doppler aortic and mitral indexes to intravenous dipyridamole was not able to identify the presence of significant CAD as assessed by quantitative coronary arteriography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The numeric late potential parameters and morphologic appearances correlated closely between the 2 methods. The restricted high frequency response of Holter systems appears not to militate against clinically useful late potential analysis from Holter tape. This study suggests that diagnostic accuracy using real-time 25 to 250-Hz criteria is acceptable for clinical use until criteria derived specifically for Holter applications become available. Holter analysis may confer significant benefits resulting from an ability to perform late potential analysis on the same tape used for conventional arrhythmia analysis, and would allow future studies of possible dynamic changes of late potentials in relation to transient ischemia and spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias.\r"

In addition, the ectopic activity was associated with couplets, tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Departures from the \"classic\" criteria of parasystole could not be explained satisfactorily if a completely protected (insulated) pacemaker was assumed. In each instance a triphasic response curve could be constructed, suggesting that modulated parasystole was the mechanism common to both patients. Couplets and runs of ventricular tachycardia were ascribed to single and repetitive reflection, respectively, in the presence of supernormal excitability of the ectopic pacemaker, the ventricle or both. In these patients, fibrillation probably resulted from spatial nonuniformity of the ventricular response to the reflected event during a phase of vulnerability. This study suggests that modulated parasystole in the presence of supernormal excitability may lead to very severe arrhythmias and trigger ventricular fibrillation. In the clinical setting, such patients may be misdiagnosed because of atypical features.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the associations of age, blood pressure (BP) and cardiac structure with left ventricular (LV) diastolic performance, 47 subjects (21 normotensives and 26 age-matched, previously untreated hypertensives) were studied by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring, radionuclide ventriculography and sector-guided M-mode echocardiography. Normotension was defined as an awake ambulatory BP less than 130/80 mm Hg and hypertension as an awake ambulatory BP greater than 135/85 mm Hg. Univariate analyses revealed strong negative correlations of LV filling rate with age (r = -0.67, p less than 0.001), 24-hour systolic or diastolic BP (r = -0.59 for systolic BP and -0.57 for diastolic BP, p less than 0.001 for both) and a modest positive correlation with LV ejection fraction (r = 0.42, p less than 0.05). After multivariate analysis, significant dependencies of both the left atrial index and LV mass index on ambulatory BP were found, which negated the significance of the relation of these 2 cardiac structural variables with LV filling rate. The final regression equation predicted LV filling rate from age, BP and LV ejection fraction. Age was the most important single correlate of LV filling, as evidenced by the 14 of 16 subjects (88%) over the age of 53 years (8 hypertensives, 6 normotensives) who had reduced LV filling rates compared with only 9 of the remaining 31 subjects (29%, all hypertensives) under the age of 53 years with reduced LV filling rates. These data demonstrate that LV filling rate is more dependent upon age and BP than left atrial or LV size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptor density, lymphocytic basal and isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response, plasma catecholamine concentrations and plasma cAMP levels were studied during maximal ergometer exercise in 11 patients with CHF secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy and in 6 healthy control subjects. At rest, there was no difference in the lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptor levels between the patients and control subjects (48 +/- 3 vs 42 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein, respectively). However, the exercise-induced increase in lymphocytic beta adrenoceptors was attenuated in patients when compared with controls (26 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein [56%] vs 75 +/- 16 fmol/mg protein [204%], respectively, p less than 0.02).

The lymphocytic cAMP response at rest and during exercise tended to be lower in patients compared with controls, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine at rest were higher in patients compared with controls, but no difference was found in the exercise values.

Patients with AS showed no difference in Doppler early filling (E) indexes, but demonstrated greater Doppler atrial filling (A) indexes in comparison to normal subjects: atrial velocity (89 +/- 31 vs 56 +/- 7 cm/s), atrial integral (11.4 +/- 4.8 vs 5.7 +/- 1.6 cm), A/E velocity (1.69 +/- 0.89 vs 1.06 +/- 0.26) and A/E integral (3.53 +/- 6.64 vs 0.81 +/- 0.27) (all p less than 0.05). Doppler indexes in patients with AS did not correlate with hemodynamic indexes of LV relaxation or chamber stiffness. Significant correlations were observed between Doppler and angiographic peak filling rates (r = 0.70) and between Doppler atrial filling velocity and LV end-diastolic volume (r = -0.66), LV end-diastolic pressure (r = -0.48) and LV ejection fraction (r = 0.53) (all p less than 0.05). These data indicate that, compared to matched normal subjects, most patients with AS have an increased atrial contribution to LV filling. However, in patients with decreased LV function, atrial function may also be depressed, as indicated by a decreased atrial contribution to LV filling, resulting in \"normalization\" of the Doppler mitral flow pattern.\r"

To evaluate this possibility, continuous-wave and pulsed Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed immediately before, during and immediately after removal of various catheters in a total of 47 adult patients without clinical evidence of valvular regurgitation. With the tip of a 7Fr balloon flotation catheter positioned in the pulmonary artery, 9 of 36 patients (25%) had pulmonary regurgitation documented by continuous-wave Doppler. Evidence for regurgitation by pulsed Doppler examination was noted in 4 of these 9, with the regurgitant signal extending a mean of 1.8 cm into the right ventricular outflow tract. Similarly, a tricuspid regurgitant signal was present in 10 of 37 patients (27%) by continuous-wave Doppler and in 6 of these 10 by pulsed Doppler, with a mean regurgitant signal depth of 2.3 cm. Doppler examination also was performed in 7 patients (2 with aortic regurgitation) with a 7Fr pigtail catheter across the aortic valve, and in 4 patients (1 with tricuspid regurgitation) with a 6Fr bipolar pacing catheter across the tricuspid valve. Catheter removal resulted in no change in either the presence or absence of a regurgitant signal, or in the regurgitant signal depth in any of the patients studied. It is concluded that standard cardiac catheters neither induce Doppler-detected valvular regurgitation, nor do they affect the retrograde distance to which an existing regurgitant signal can be mapped.\r"

The correlation between anular dilatation and TR severity is unclear. Unfortunately, there is no simple, accurate method of assessing the presence and severity of TR. Real-time (color flow) Doppler echocardiography, a sophisticated but expensive technique, facilitates noninvasive determination of the presence and severity of TR by the area and depth of color-encoded, systolic turbulent reflux into the right atrium. In this study, TR severity (0 to 4+), assessed by color flow Doppler, was correlated with diastolic and systolic tricuspid valve anulus dimension, measured by computerized calipers, from the apical 4-chamber and right ventricular inflow 2-dimensional views. Forty-six patients were studied: 32 with 0 to 2+ TR and 14 with functional 3 to 4+ TR. TR severity correlated significantly with the tricuspid valve anulus in both diastole and systole. The correlation was best in the apical 4-chamber view during systole (r = 0.88, p less than 0.0001). No patient with tricuspid valve anulus in systole less than 3.2 cm or in diastole less than 3.4 cm had severe (3 to 4+) TR. Thus, measurement of the tricuspid valve anulus by 2-dimensional echocardiography is a simple, noninvasive method to identify patients with moderate to severe TR.\r"

With M-mode echocardiography, fine fluttering of the structure generating the murmur was evident in 23 patients with musical murmurs and in 5 with noisy murmurs. A continuous-wave Doppler spectral signal characterized by parallel harmonics (Doppler musical signal) was evident in all patients with musical murmurs and in none with a noisy murmur. With pulsed-wave Doppler, the musical signal had less defined spectral features because of range ambiguity. Such a signal was experimentally reproduced by activating a diapason bathed in saline solution. The source of the musical murmur was established in all 51 patients by Doppler. The musical signal was associated with a valvular regurgitation signal in 36 patients and with a ventricular septal defect in 1 patient. The musical signal always disappeared when the pulsed-wave Doppler sample volume was placed 2 cm away from the generating structure. In 11 patients with musical murmur examined by color Doppler, no abnormal bidirectional flow signal was observed in the structures generating the signal. In 6 of the patients without valvular regurgitation, no flow disturbance was found. In conclusion, Doppler is valuable in determining the source of musical murmurs, and musical murmurs are caused by a vibrating structure even in the absence of flow turbulence.\r"

Three diagnostic entities have been proposed to explain the morbidity of this group: microvascular angina, esophageal motility disorders and panic disorder. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that panic disorder is found frequently in patients with chest pain who have normal epicardial vessels. Ninety-four subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries were interviewed according to a structured psychiatric protocol within 24 hours of their catheterizations. Thirty-two (34%) fit Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (third edition, revised) criteria for current panic disorder. Because panic disorder can be effectively treated, physicians should consider this diagnosis in this group of patients. Current research findings suggest that panic disorder, microvascular angina and esophageal disorders may each form the basis for chest pain in approximately 25% of these patients. Miscellaneous problems account for the other 25%.\r"

The study was performed under blinded conditions during a 21-day hospitalization after a 3-week drug-free outpatient phase. In the 15 hypertensive patients receiving dilevalol orally in single morning doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg each for 5 days, the drug was shown to reduce blood pressure effectively for 24 hours at all doses. The antihypertensive effect was significantly related to dose administered and to the concentration of unchanged dilevalol measured in plasma. Dilevalol did not cause excessive changes in heart rate at rest and did not produce postural hypotension. The antihypertensive effectiveness of dilevalol was essentially the same after the first and fifth (steady state) doses at each dose level. Finally, no tendency toward rebound hypertension or tachycardia was observed after the abrupt discontinuation of dilevalol in these patients.\r"

To document vasodilation in humans, single oral doses of dilevalol, 200 mg, and placebo were randomly administered to 12 untreated hypertensive patients. Dilevalol produced significant reductions (p less than or equal to 0.01) in diastolic blood pressure throughout a 24-hour period relative to placebo, without changing heart rate. Forearm blood flow, measured hourly over the initial 4 hours after dosing, demonstrated a shift to a more vasodilated state after dilevalol administration, with significant increases in minimal forearm blood flow (4.0 vs 2.9 ml/dl tissue/min, dilevalol vs placebo, respectively; p = 0.05) and in mean average forearm blood flow (5.3 vs 4.0 ml/dl tissue/min, dilevalol vs placebo; p = 0.04). Similarly, dilevalol produced a decrease in mean forearm vascular resistance (26.5 vs 34.6 mm Hg/ml/dl tissue/min, dilevalol vs placebo; p = 0.02). In the absence of a change in heart rate, the acute hypotensive response to dilevalol in these patients appears to have resulted primarily from vasodilation and reduced vascular resistance.\r"

The effects of the infusion on forearm blood flow were assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography. Dilevalol caused a progressive increase in flow in all subjects up to the intermediate dose given, with the effect being attenuated when the dose was increased further. Simultaneous propranolol infusion reduced the increase in flow induced by dilevalol, shifting the dilevalol-induced vasodilation dose response curve to the right. Isoproterenol infusion caused a marked, dose-related increase in flow that was equally well reduced by simultaneous infusion of dilevalol or propranolol. These results indicate that dilevalol effectively blocks peripheral vascular beta receptors in humans. The drug also acts as a partial beta 2-receptor agonist, causing vasodilation which can be reduced by co-administration of propranolol.\r"

Hemodynamic measurements were obtained at baseline, after acute treatment (first dose) with dilevalol (400 mg) and atenolol (50 mg) or metoprolol (100 mg), and again after subchronic treatment with these agents. After both acute and subchronic treatment (mean daily dose 1,042 mg), dilevalol significantly reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP, p less than 0.0001), by significantly reducing systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI, p less than 0.001), and by not significantly altering cardiac index (CI). In contrast, atenolol and metoprolol significantly reduced MAP (p less than 0.002) by significantly reducing CI (p less than 0.0001), with a concomitant increase in SVRI (p less than 0.007). Heart rate (HR) was reduced significantly less (p less than 0.006) with dilevalol than with the cardioselective agents. Correlation of the decrease in MAP with other hemodynamic parameters revealed that the effects on MAP of acute treatment with the cardioselective drugs are related to a decrease in HR (r = 0.63, p = 0.002), whereas those of subchronic treatment are correlated to a decrease in CI (r = 0.59, p = 0.01). The decrease in MAP after acute and subchronic dilevalol treatment is correlated primarily with SVRI (r = 0.46 to 0.49, p less than 0.01) and only secondarily with HR (r = 0.34, p less than 0.05). Therefore, the main mechanism of antihypertensive action for dilevalol is vasodilation, in contrast to the cardioselective agents, which is beta blockade.\r"

In a separate bicenter study with a similar design, dilevalol was compared with atenolol in elderly hypertensive patients (aged greater than or equal to 65 years) (study 2).

Indexes of LV function--as assessed by end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, LV ejection time and ejection fraction--were better preserved by dilevalol than by metoprolol.

Renal function was determined in these subjects on the same day before and after dosing. In addition, patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (n = 11) and hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency (n = 6) were treated with placebo to establish baseline blood pressure and then were given dilevalol, 400 to 1,600 mg/day, for 2 to 6 weeks until blood pressure was controlled. Renal function was determined at the end of the baseline period and again at the end of dilevalol treatment. A subgroup of elderly hypertensives from the 2 protocols used to study hypertensive patients was treated as a separate study group. The only effect on parameters of renal function seen in any of the study groups was a statistically significant 15% decrease in glomerular filtration rate after single-dose treatment in the elderly normotensive group. Effective renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, renal blood flow and renal vascular resistance were unchanged before and after treatment in all groups. Mean arterial pressure was reduced significantly in all groups except in the elderly normotensive volunteers. Dilevalol appears to be a well-tolerated, effective therapeutic agent that is neutral regarding its effect on renal function and potentially useful in a variety of patient populations.\r"

To determine whether similar changes occur in patients with angina pectoris, arterial potassium levels were measured before, during and immediately after maximal bicycle exercise in 20 patients with exertional angina. In 10 of these patients, leg blood flow and arteriovenous potassium levels also were measured. During exercise, arterial potassium increased significantly both from rest to submaximal exercise (4.3 +/- 0.1 to 4.7 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter, p less than 0.01) and from submaximal to maximal exercise (5.4 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter, p less than 0.01). Within 1 minute of cessation of exercise, arterial potassium had decreased to 4.7 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter (p less than 0.001) and continued to decrease to a minimum of 4.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter between 3 and 5 minutes after exercise, significantly less than the rest value (p less than 0.05). At maximal exercise (99 +/- 9 watts), the calculated release of potassium from each leg reached 2.7 +/- 1.3 mmol/min. Four minutes after exercise, the leg muscles were resorbing potassium at 0.24 mmol/min. In these patients with exertional myocardial ischemia, the magnitude and rapidity of arterial potassium changes during and after exercise resemble those found in normal subjects, but occurred at much lower workloads. Release and resorption of potassium by exercising muscle in patients with angina pectoris may cause potentially arrhythmogenic arterial potassium fluctuations.\r"

Cholesterol and triglyceride levels in plasma, lipoprotein fractions and several apolipoproteins were measured in 108 men (90 of whom had undergone coronary angiography): 22 had variant angina, 56 had fixed CAD (effort angina and old myocardial infarction) and 30 were normal subjects. Patients with variant angina showed more severe atherosclerotic lesions than the control group, but less severe lesions than the patients with fixed CAD. In comparison with lipid and apolipoprotein, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, apo AI and apo AII decreased significantly in control, variant angina and fixed CAD groups, respectively. Additionally, stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that apo AI was the best discriminator among the 3 groups or between variant angina or fixed CAD and the control group. Variant angina and fixed CAD patients could be discriminated from the control subjects by an apo AI level of 135 and 126 mg/dl, with 71% (p less than 0.025) and 73% (p less than 0.005) accuracy, respectively. By these criteria 77% of the patients with variant angina and 73% of the patients with fixed CAD were precisely discriminated. Discrimination between variant angina and fixed CAD patients, however, was not practical, even if the best discriminator was used. Thus, the apo AI level is useful in discriminating patients with variant angina and fixed CAD from normal subjects. Therefore, symptomatic patients with low apo AI levels should be aggressively examined.\r"

An algorithm was designed that retrospectively examined the results of each test in a stepwise fashion to simulate a clinical decision-making process. The results of the clinical examination, each of the exercise tests and the noninvasive diagnostic algorithm were compared with the results of coronary arteriography. The predictive accuracy of the clinical evaluation was 36%, treadmill stress testing 57%, treadmill stress plus arm ergometry 74%, exercise radionuclide ventriculography 57% and the noninvasive diagnostic algorithm 89%. When discriminant analysis was applied to all of the exercise variables, no individual test improved the accuracy of the noninvasive diagnostic algorithm. When the analysis considered only individual variables without the algorithm, the model correctly classified only 67% of the patients. Thus, accurate noninvasive evaluation of coronary artery disease is possible in patients with severe peripheral vascular disease when care is taken to design exercise protocols that allow adequate stress on the cardiovascular system.\r"

Each of 12 male habitual smokers with coronary artery disease was given dipyridamole (75 mg) and aspirin (324 mg), dipyridamole (75 mg) and placebo for aspirin, or a placebo for each drug 3 times daily for 1 week before each of three 20-minute periods (separated by 2 weeks) of smoking 2 cigarettes after a 12-hour period of abstinence. During each period of smoking there were increases in the mean values of the plasma concentrations of beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4 and nicotine, the endothelial cell count and the blood level of carboxyhemoglobin. In addition, the mean platelet aggregate ratio decreased during each period. After administration of placebos for both dipyridamole and aspirin, the respective mean values +/- standard deviations before and after smoking were 28 +/- 8 and 30 +/- 7 ng/ml (beta-thromboglobulin), 7.4 +/- 1.0 and 8.2 +/- 1.4 ng/ml (platelet factor 4), 3.7 +/- 0.6 and 15.7 +/- 3.5 ng/ml (nicotine), 4.2 +/- 1.4 and 5.4 +/- 1.7/counting chamber (endothelial cell count), 5.0 +/- 2.2 and 6.6 +/- 2.2% (carboxyhemoglobin) and 0.80 +/- 0.07 and 0.68 +/- 0.10 (platelet aggregate ratio). Each of the differences between the means before and after smoking was statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.02). Neither dipyridamole alone nor in combination with aspiring significantly affected the mean smoking-induced change in any of these variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism of slowing of the rate of ventricular tachycardias (VTs) by procainamide, resetting response patterns were characterized in 24 VTs in 22 patients. All patients had coronary artery disease and inducible sustained VT during procainamide therapy. Only tachycardias with the same surface QRS morphology before and after procainamide were studied: all were slowed by procainamide. The mean cycle length was 292 +/- 61 ms before and 374 +/- 61 ms after procainamide (p less than 0.05). The mean effective refractory period, measured at the right ventricle, was 241 +/- 21 ms before and 261 +/- 24 ms after procainamide (p less than 0.05). During procainamide therapy, single and double extrastimuli were delivered during VT and resetting response patterns identified. Patterns were characterized as flat, increasing or flat plus increasing. Resetting was seen in 17 (71%) of these VTs and resetting response patterns were identified in 16 (94%) of these. The resetting response pattern was flat in 7, flat plus increasing in 5 and increasing in 4. The finding of some flat portion at the end of resetting response patterns in 12 VTs after procainamide indicates that the reentrant impulse conducts through fully recovered tissue within the circuit. It suggests that procainamide slowed these VTs by slowing conduction velocity in fully recovered tissue due to sodium channel blockade and not by prolongation of action potentials and refractory periods.\r"

We prospectively followed 50 pregnancies in 49 patients with 62 cardiac prostheses from presentation at the antenatal clinic through the remainder of the pregnancy. Of the 60 mechanical prostheses, 39 were Medtronic-Hall, 7 St. Jude Medical, 7 Starr-Edwards and 7 Bjork-Shiley. Forty-three patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II and 6 were in functional class III or IV. Forty-five patients were in sinus rhythm and 4 had chronic atrial fibrillation. All patients received warfarin during the first and second trimesters. Forty-one pregnancies proceeded beyond 28 weeks. In 23 of these (group I) warfarin was replaced with heparin at 36 weeks gestation. In the remaining 18 (group II) warfarin was not substituted owing to premature onset of labor. The target prothrombin ratio (international normalized ratio) in patients receiving warfarin was 2.0 to 2.5. The partial thromboplastin time was maintained at 1.5 to 2.5 times the control value in patients receiving heparin. Eleven patients received dipyridamole plus warfarin for the duration of pregnancy. There were no maternal thromboembolic complications or deaths associated with pregnancy. Antepartum hemorrhage occurred in 1 patient at 35 weeks gestation. One patient (group I) experienced peripartum hemorrhage. All patients were hemodynamically stable before delivery, but 2 developed pulmonary edema during labor. The mean fetal birth weight was low (2.54 +/- 0.98 kg). There were 9 abortions (18%), 7 stillbirths (14%), 2 neonatal deaths (4%) and 2 instances of warfarin embryopathy (4%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Simultaneous cardiac catheterization and Doppler echocardiography were performed in 23 group 2 patients. Doppler and surgical findings were compared in 7 patients too ill for invasive studies. In group 1 patients, the maximal velocity (+/- standard deviation) was 1.8 +/- 0.37 m/s, the mean pressure gradient was 7.1 +/- 3.07 mm Hg and the mean aortic valve area was 2.2 +/- 0.79 cm2. The maximal velocity in group 2 patients with aortic regurgitation (AR) classified as moderate or greater was 2.5 +/- 0.55 m/s, compared with 1.8 +/- 0.44 m/s in patients with mild AR or less (p less than 0.01). In the quantitation of AR, pulsed-wave mapping and angiographic grades were identical in 18 patients and differed by 1 grade in 5. Seven patients too ill for catheterization had severe destruction of valve leaflets at cardiac surgery. In 6 patients, both Doppler grading methods suggested severe AR. In a seventh patient, who had an obstructed Starr-Edwards valve in the mitral position, AR was graded as mild by pulsed-wave mapping. Only 1 patient had homograft valve stenosis, with a withdrawal gradient at catheterization of 34 mm Hg and a Doppler maximal gradient of 36 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-nine patients were investigated. Based on clinical findings, 36 of 39 patients had normal prosthetic valve function. Seventeen patients were interrogated within a few days after surgery. Systolic regurgitant jets in the left atrium were absent in all patients by both transthoracic pulsed and color Doppler flow imaging. Using transthoracic continuous wave Doppler, however, jets were demonstrated in 8 of 39 patients (21%). Transesophageal color Doppler flow imaging demonstrated systolic regurgitant jets originating from the prosthesis in all patients. Tilting disc valves showed jets during the entire systole (closure and leakage backflow). Each type of prosthesis generated a specific jet pattern. Pathologic regurgitant jets were crescent-shaped, more extensive and turbulent than jets caused by normal closure and leakage backflow. Thus, transthoracic color Doppler flow imaging is not sensitive for detecting regurgitant jets in mechanical prostheses in the mitral valve. All mechanical prostheses show a specific jet pattern, which should be helpful when transesophageal echocardiography is used to identify pathologic backflow.\r"

Complete segmental diagnosis was made in 16 patients, and further study was needed in 2 others. In 8 of the 18 patients a new diagnosis was provided, and in 10 patients diagnosis was confirmed. Congenital heart disease was found in 12 patients, other heart disease in 2 and a normal heart in 4. The population included 2 fetuses whose echocardiograms showed hypoplastic left heart and intracardiac tumor. In 4 patients transport was avoided. This is the first report of echocardiographic transmission by telephone, which was shown to be clearly feasible, cost-effective and diagnostic. It provides emergency access to specialist expertise, and may avoid hazardous and expensive transport of ill children.\r"

Echocardiography was performed before exercise. Resting LV ejection fraction was depressed in 13 patients and LV mass was increased in 10 patients. Exercise produced nonsignificant increases (of similar magnitude) in mean LV ejection fraction in the subgroups with normal and depressed resting LV ejection fraction. Exercise produced a significant increase in LV ejection fraction from 54 +/- 8 to 65 +/- 12% (p less than 0.005) in the subgroup with normal LV mass, but produced no significant change in LV ejection fraction in the subgroup with increased LV mass (53 +/- 10 at rest, 50 +/- 12% during exercise). Moreover, the LV exercise response (change in LV ejection fraction during exercise) in the subgroup with normal LV mass was significantly different from that in the subgroup with increased LV mass (p less than 0.005). There was a strong positive correlation between LV mass and the percent over ideal body weight (r = 0.912, p = 0.01) and a strong negative correlation between LV mass and LV exercise response (r = 0.829, p = 0.01). The results suggest that increased LV mass predisposes morbidly obese patients to impairment of LV systolic function during exercise.\r"

Left ventricular shape, wall motion and valve morphology were evaluated with 2-dimensional echocardiography. Valve function was assessed using Doppler cardiography. Left ventricular performance was evaluated with shortening fraction, afterload with end-systolic wall stress and contractility with the end-systolic wall stress and rate-corrected velocity of shortening relation. Although left ventricular performance, afterload and contractility varied widely, 2 patterns of left ventricular function abnormalities were noted. Hyperdynamic left ventricular performance, generally with enhanced contractility and reduced afterload, was the most common echocardiographic finding (63%). Diminished contractility was noted in 8 patients (26%), including 4 patients with symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy. Serial echocardiographic evaluation revealed changes from the original level (elevated, normal or depressed) of left ventricular function, afterload or contractility in 89%. Pericardial effusion without tamponade was seen in 8 patients (26%). Mononuclear pericarditis, myocarditis and inflammation of the intracardiac conduction tissue as well as peripheral nerve were seen in autopsy specimens, yet histologic or culture evidence of myocardial infection with opportunistic organisms was lacking. High grade atrial (1 patient) and ventricular (3 patients) ectopy, as well as second-degree atrioventricular block, were observed. Cardiac abnormalities, detectable by noninvasive methods but often clinically inapparent, appear to be common in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection and may cause symptoms or even death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Complete injury to the cervical spinal cord results in total disruption of central sympathetic outflow. Although ventricular repolarization can be significantly influenced by disorders of autonomic function, the effects of cervical sympathectomy are unknown. Therefore, 40 subjects with complete chronic spinal cord injury were prospectively divided into 2 groups, half with total disruption of central sympathetic outflow (level of injury C5 to C8) known as the high level injury group, and half with nearly intact sympathetic innervation (T10 to L1) serving as controls. The completeness of autonomic dysfunction was verified by the cold pressor response. ST-segment analysis of the resting surface electrocardiogram revealed multilead ST elevation in the high level injury group, with maximum ST height significantly higher than the control group (131 +/- 21 [standard error] vs 47 +/- 8 microV; p = 0.0005). Unlike the control subjects, maximal arm ergometry exercise in the high level injury subjects failed to decrease ST-segment height (delta ST = -3 +/- 6 vs -43 +/- 14 microV in controls; p = 0.02). This difference persisted even after matching for exercise capacity. However, during exogenous stimulation with the sympathomimetic amine isoproterenol, ST-segment height in the high level injury group markedly decreased (mean delta ST = -84 +/- 26 vs -17 +/- 18 microV in controls; p = 0.04). Thus, central sympathetic dysfunction regularly results in multilead ST-segment elevation that decreases to or below isoelectric baseline during low dose isoproterenol infusion. Unlike normal subjects and individuals with normal variant ST-segment elevation, ST height is not altered by exercise. These findings document that ST-segment height in man is greatly influenced by central sympathetic nervous activity both at baseline and during physiologic and pharmacologic stress.\r"

Sixteen healthy male college students consumed a high-carbohydrate diet for 2 wk followed by a high-fat diet for the next 2 wk. Fasting blood samples were taken on day 0 (base line), 14, and 28, and analyzed for urea and glucose. At the end of the fasting period the blood urea level increased significantly (p less than 0.05) and the glucose level decreased. At day 14, blood urea was negatively correlated to sucrose intake (p less than 0.01) and at day 28, the relationship between blood glucose and energy intake was negative (p less than 0.02). The findings suggest possible use of a Ramadan fasting model for studies related to energy metabolism and regulation of energy intake.\r"

In addition, energy expenditure was estimated from 24-h heart rate recordings carried out on two randomly chosen days of the 2-wk period. The group means of the dlwEE were 1.94 +/- 0.24 (means +/- SD) times larger than resting metabolic rate (= 1.94 met) and nearly identical to the average daily energy intake (1.93 +/- 0.23 met). Energy expenditure estimated from the diaries of activity and from the 24-h heart rate recording varied between 1.67 and 2.24 met depending on the calculation procedure. The dlwEE (1.94 +/- 0.24 met) is much higher than that recently determined for sedentary people (1.25 met) and thus explains that young students may achieve body weight balance with a relatively high daily food energy intake.\r"

Weekly variations were also measured. Energy intake was lowest during the ovulatory phase compared with postovulatory, premenses, and menses phases (p less than 0.05). The maximum difference, 1.36 MJ (324 kcal)/d, occurred between ovulatory and postovulatory phases and was twofold higher than the increase of 0.64 MJ (152 kcal)/d observed at weekends. This reduction of food intake at ovulation has not been previously described in humans. It coincides with the expected peak in circulating estrogen levels and is consistent with the hypothesis in animal models that estrogen is an appetite suppressant.\r"

During an initial 4-wk control period all women consumed a typical Western diet (40% of total calories from fat, 400 mg cholesterol/d, 12 g dietary fiber/d, and a ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids [P:S] of 0.5). After this control period they were switched to a low-fat, high-fiber diet for 8-10 wk, which consisted of 25% of calories from fat, P:S of 1.0, cholesterol of 200 mg cholesterol/d, and 40 g dietary fiber/d. Compared with the control period 16 of 17 women had lower serum estrone sulfate levels on the low-fat, high-fiber diet. There was an average decrease of 36% with mean levels decreasing from 2.11 +/- 0.25 nmol/L (means +/- SEM) on the control diet to 1.29 +/- 0.19 nmol/L on the experimental diet (p less than 0.001).

In rats fed EWD, high Zn enhanced femoral Zn deposition and concentration but did not affect serum Ca levels, bone mineral content (BMC), or turnover. Serum Ca levels and BMC were greater in sham rats and there was a gain in femoral Ca and phosphorus compared with the loss of these minerals in ovax rats. In CRD-fed ovax rats, values for these variables were similar to those of CRD-fed shams and there was no bone mineral loss. These data suggest that ovarian function may be a prerequisite for the beneficial effects of diets containing 1,25-(OH)2cholecalciferol and low Ca on bone metabolism.\r"

No shift in the site of intestinal absorption and no change in the distribution of labeled lipid in the intestinal mucosa was observed.

Taurine status exerted a significant effect on platelet aggregability. Platelets from taurine-depleted cats were twice as sensitive to aggregation as platelets from cats receiving taurine. On the other hand, platelets from humans with normal taurine status increased resistance to aggregation by 30-70% when supplemented with taurine at 400 or 1600 mg/d, respectively. Decreased platelet aggregability was associated with increased platelet taurine and glutathione concentrations and decreased thromboxane release on aggregation. These data indicate that taurine in vivo stabilizes platelets against aggregation such that during taurine depletion platelets become overly sensitive whereas during supplementation their tendency to aggregate is depressed.\r"

Using a cross-over design with the first formula randomly assigned, two 72-h balance studies were performed with carmine red, an intermittent external marker, and polyethylene glycol (PEG), a continuous internal marker. Formula and stools were analyzed for total carbohydrate (anthrone method) and PEG. There were no significant differences between the two formula periods for carbohydrate intake, mean daily stool output, or fecal carbohydrate excretion. Mean fecal carbohydrate excretion was less than 0.2 g/d, or less than 1% of carbohydrate intake. Thus, older (32-wk gestation) premature infants fed either 100% lactose or 50% lactose plus 50% glucose polymers have minimal fecal losses of intact carbohydrate.\r"

In this study the intestinal absorption of glucose and glycine was measured during steady-state perfusion of the jejunum in 10 NIDDM subjects and in 11 healthy volunteers. Absorption rates were linearly related to solute load for both glucose and glycine. Over the range of solute concentrations, absorption rates of glucose (F = 4.38, p less than 0.05) and glycine (F = 7.07, p less than 0.02) were slightly reduced in diabetic subjects. The reduction in absorption rates may be accounted for by differences in age and diet between the groups. It is concluded that glucose and amino acid absorption is not increased in human NIDDM.\r"

To determine whether this observation was due to differences in acid production from bacterial carbohydrate fermentation, feces from each subject were incubated with lactulose. There were no differences in in vitro acid or hydrogen production between groups. We conclude that malabsorbed carbohydrate fails to induce in vivo colonic acidification in CH4 excretors. In contrast, in vitro fecal carbohydrate fermentation is similar among CH4 excretors and nonexcretors. These results suggest differences between these two groups in the colonic absorption of fermentation products.\r"

There was no difference in absorption between ferrous fumarate and ferrous sulfate whereas the values for ferrous succinate, ferrous saccharate (10% Fe), and ferric pyrophosphate were 92%, 74%, and 39% of the ferrous sulfate values, respectively.

  ".W": "This study extended initial observations that indicated the potential of dualphoton absorptiometry (DPA) to measure total-body bone mineral (TBBM) and fat in vivo. DPA-derived TBBM and fat were compared with established methods in 13 subjects (aged 24-94 y) who underwent measurement of body density (Db), total-body water (TBW), potassium (TBK), calcium (TBCa, delayed-gamma neutron activation), and nitrogen (prompt-gamma neutron activation). TBBM was highly correlated with TBCa (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001) and the slope of TBCa vs TBBM (0.34) was similar to Ca content of ashed skeleton (0.34-0.38). DPA-measured fat (means +/- SD, 16.7 +/- 4.9 kg) correlated significantly (r = 0.79-0.94; p less than 0.01-0.001) with fat established by Db (16.3 +/- 5.4 kg), TBW (16.0 +/- 4.3 kg), TBK (17.7 +/- 4.6 kg), combined TBW-neutron activation (17.6 +/- 5.9 kg), and means of all four methods (16.9 +/- 4.8 kg). DPA thus offers a new opportunity to study human skeleton in vivo and to quantify fat by a method independent from the classical assumption that bone represents a fixed fraction of fat-free body mass.\r"

Cu, zinc, calcium, magnesium, and iron balances were determined 1 wk before the study (pretest) when the subjects consumed self-selected diets and after consuming the experimental diets for 6 wk. No major differences in mineral balances were evident between the two groups during the pretest study when the subjects ate self-selected diets. In contrast, when fed the test diets, the group consuming the low-Cu fructose diet had significantly more positive balances for all minerals studied than the group fed the low-Cu cornstarch diet. The results indicate that dietary fructose enhances mineral balance.\r"

Three postdialysis blood samples were drawn just before and 1 and 2 h after aspartame or placebo consumption. After aspartame consumption statistically significant increases in only two amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine, were noted at 1 and 2 h when compared with placebo values. The increases in phenylalanine were within the normal postprandial range for healthy subjects; no other increases in essential or nonessential amino acids, except for tyrosine, were detected. This study supports the view that aspartame is safe for diabetic subjects with chronic renal failure.\r"

The food groupings are traditional ones, such as red meat, poultry, and milk, which are further divided by fat and dietary fiber content. Women have made major changes in their diets. The grams consumed within most food groups have decreased and the diversity of their diet and the number of lower-fat foods consumed have increased. The percentage consuming several higher-fat foods, such as higher-fat cheeses, desserts, and mixed grain dishes, has also increased.

Seven patients had hysterectomy; one had curettage and radiation only. The polypoid endometrial tumors were composed of adenosarcoma admixed with SCEs; the latter accounted for 5-50% of the tumor. The SCEs were multifocal in six cases and formed a solitary mass at the base of the adenosarcoma in the remaining two cases. Benign-appearing epithelial-type cells, often containing abundant eosinophilic or foamy, lipid-rich cytoplasm, were arranged in solid nests, trabeculae, and solid or hollow tubules. Myometrial invasion was observed microscopically in six cases. Of seven patients with postoperative follow-up information, six were alive with no evidence of recurrent tumor at postoperative intervals of 3-11 years. The patient treated only by curettage and radiation had persistent intrauterine tumor at 7 months and died of an unrelated illness at 16 months. This study indicates that occasional uterine adenosarcomas contain SCEs similar to those described in endometrial stromal tumors and uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors. The clinical and pathologic features of these tumors are otherwise similar to those of typical uterine adenosarcomas.\r"

This novel method is simple and capable of determining endogenous metabolic turnover of physiologically important plasma constituents in both therapeutic and experimental settings. The model was suggested by the therapeutic use of plasmapheresis in hyperlipidemia, and the turnover rates of triglyceride and cholesterol were calculated for one patient treated with chronic plasmapheresis. It is concluded that at least a two-compartment model is necessary to quantitatively describe the effect of plasmapheresis on any substance that undergoes appreciable endogenous turnover (metabolic clearance rate greater than 1.1 times plasmapheresis rate when both rates are in units of volume per time). Calculation of endogenous turnover rate with the use of measurements of the concentration of a solute in plasma before and after plasmapheresis and in the total plasmapheresate and measurement of the volume of plasma removed, volume of plasma substitute infused, and total plasmapheresis time is detailed. This method avoids the use of isotopic labeling experiments. In turn, the endogenous turnover rate may predict the efficacy of therapeutic plasmapheresis.\r"

Sufficient blood was available for performance of all laboratory tests ordered at the time of the phlebotomy. Although substituting pediatric-size tubes does not address the problem of excessive use of laboratory tests, smaller tubes may reduce the severity of phlebotomy-induced anemia in adults without compromising laboratory test procedures.\r"

The diagnostic accuracy of the two assays was similar, with sensitivities of 92% and 87% and specificities of 87% and 91% with the use of rabbit and goat antisera, respectively. Both ELISAs detected Giardia antigen in stool samples from asymptomatic as well as symptomatic excretors and from treated patients after organisms were no longer visualized by microscopic examination. The specificity of the assays was confirmed by consistently negative results on stool specimens from 10 neonates and 27 patients with enteric parasitic infections other than Giardia. Negative results also occurred when stool specimens containing 21 bacterial enteropathogens were tested. Potential confounding variables including multiple freezing and thawing episodes, prolonged storage, and stool filtration did not affect test results from clinical specimens. Antidiarrheal compounds did not interfere with assay results. Preservation of specimens in formalin did interfere with the assay, even if formalinized stool specimens were dialyzed before testing. For diagnosis of giardiasis, the ELISA is a sensitive and specific test that is not influenced by many environmental factors or by other enteropathogens. This test provides a practical and reliable method for evaluating large numbers of specimens in a variety of clinical and epidemiologic settings.\r"

A diagnosis was established after the patient's blast cell count decreased considerably three weeks after the initial leukemic phase. The blast population in the authors' case expressed Leu-9 (CD7), 6D1, and TdT+. Cytochemistries showed some of the blast population to be peroxidase positive and Sudan black positive. Platelet peroxidase by electron microscopic examination showed some positive blasts. Therefore, surface markers and cytochemical studies in this case suggested an abnormal proliferation involving a pluripotential stem cell capable of expressing myeloid and lymphoid characteristics. Cytogenetics was performed at birth and showed 47,XY,+21/48,XY,+21,+mar, confirming the diagnosis of Down's syndrome. The origin of the chromosomal fragment was uncertain. It was of interest that during the remission phase of his pseudoleukemia there was a concomitant decrease in the extra chromosomal fragment. Immunoglobulin and T-cell antigen receptor gene rearrangement studies showed only germline patterns, indicating that the lymphoid cells in the blast population were not clonally expanded. Therefore, immunoglobulin and T-cell antigen receptor rearrangement analysis and immunophenotyping are extremely valuable techniques in distinguishing between TAM and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients with Down's syndrome.\r"

Medicine is an unusual enterprise in that there are no sharp dividing lines between what is necessary and what is clearly unnecessary or between perfectly acceptable and unacceptable outcomes.

  ".U": "89270366\r", 
  ".W": "Acellular pertussis vaccines, which have been used in Japan since 1981, vary in antigenic constituents among manufacturers. First, to assess the immunogenicity by manufacturer and patient age, 161 children aged 3 months to 2 years were immunized by acellular pertussis vaccine from one of three Japanese manufacturers, Biken, Takeda, or Kitasato. Anti-pertussis toxin antibody responses for children immunized with Takeda and Kitasato vaccines were comparable with patients with pertussis in the convalescent stage, and anti-pertussis toxin antibody response for Biken vaccine was far higher than those of convalescing patients. Anti-filamentous hemagglutinin antibody responses for the children given the three vaccines were far higher than those of the patients. Weak serotype 1.3 agglutinin responses were observed only in children administered the Takeda vaccine. Comparing these antibody responses among various age groups, the immunogenicity of acellular vaccines in children aged 3 to 6 months was comparable with children aged 2 years. Second, to assess the manufacturer-specific efficacy, 495 households of patients with pertussis were surveyed from 1981 to 1988. The estimated efficacy of the acellular pertussis vaccines in children aged 2 to 8 years was 82%, and there were no major differences in the secondary attack rates among children immunized with acellular pertussis vaccine from each manufacturer, ie, 12.5% (1/8) for Biken, 11.1% (2/18) for Takeda, and 5.9% (1/17) for Kitasato. We conclude from these two studies that similar efficacy was observed in children aged 2 years or older for acellular pertussis vaccines from the three manufacturers, which produced anti-pertussis toxin antibody responses comparable with patients with pertussis and far higher antifilamentous hemagglutinin antibody responses than in the convalescing patients, and that age did not affect the immunogenicity of acellular vaccines.\r"

At 2-month intervals throughout the study period, pulmonary function tests, oropharyngeal cultures, and serologic tests for respiratory viruses were performed in all subjects. Quantitative sputum cultures for bacteria were performed in subjects with cystic fibrosis. The same laboratory specimens were also collected at the time of all acute respiratory illnesses. Over the 2-year period, 398 viral cultures and serum samples were collected, 210 from patients with cystic fibrosis and 188 from their siblings. The frequency of culture-documented and seropositive viral infections was not significantly different between patients with cystic fibrosis and their siblings. The patients with the highest frequency of viral infection were younger and had the lowest rate of decline in lung function and severity score. We conclude that school-age patients with cystic fibrosis are no more susceptible to viral infections than their unaffected siblings. We were unable to demonstrate any significant adverse effect of respiratory viral infections on pulmonary function in 19 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 5 to 21 years.\r"

Anthropometric measurements included triceps, subscapular, and thigh skin folds. The subjects ran 12-minute and 2.4-km runs on separate days. Using a multiple-stepwise forward regression analysis, equations were developed to predict oxygen uptake as VO2 and VO2/kg, accounting for 81% and 64% of the variance, respectively. A validation procedure was done 5 months later when all runs and measurements were repeated, and predicted and measured oxygen uptake were compared. The equation for predicting VO2 accounted for 88% of the variance, with the SE of the estimate equal to 0.07 L/min. The equation for predicting VO2/kg accounted for 58% of the variance, with the SE of the estimate equal to 27 mL of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute. The VO2 can be accurately predicted using indirect means in adolescents, while VO2/kg cannot.\r"

They received two puffs every 2 minutes from metered-dose inhalers with spacers (range, 4 to 14 puffs) titrated until improvement stopped. Peak expiratory flow increased 34% for metered-dose inhalers with spacers after the first 2 puffs and increased 87% for metered-dose inhalers with spacers after dose titration. After titration, respiratory rate decreased by 12%, heart rate increased by 2%, and breath sounds improved in 92% of the patients. We concluded that the metered-dose inhalers with spacers are an effective device for the treatment of asthma in the pediatric emergency department and that the use of metered-dose inhalers with spacers with titration can achieve significant bronchodilation in the treatment of patients with acute asthma.\r"

Marked symptomatic improvement in children with meningitis was demonstrated following lumbar puncture, while no significant change was demonstrated in the control group.

These plasma vitamin K concentrations varied greatly among the neonates from values below the limit of detection (2 ng/mL) to more than 1000 ng/mL. The vitamin K concentration was associated with nutritive vitamin K deficiency represented by plasma protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) values. The wide variation in vitamin K absorption is considered to be one of the major causative factors in infantile vitamin K deficiency.\r"

Analysis of questionnaire data from 90 campers before and after their participation in the program revealed that desirable changes occurred in each of these areas and were sustained for at least 3 months after the program. Siblings reported by parents to have behavioral problems with onset since the diagnosis of the cancer seemed to benefit particularly from this type of program. No substantial negative effects were found regardless of the camper age, adaptational status, or previous camp experience.\r"

Randomly selected experimental and control groups differed only in that the former group viewed a slide-tape presentation. Testing of population samples before and after the presentation disclosed a highly significant improvement in knowledge about fever in the experimental population that persisted for almost 6 months. Monitoring of subsequent clinic visits revealed a 30% to 35% decrease in visits for fever and a 20% to 25% decrease in all visits for acute problems. These findings suggest that an audiovisual health education intervention can significantly improve patient confidence in managing fever as reflected by decreased clinic visits. This program is potentially useful in both the office and clinic in a health maintenance organization setting.\r"

Causal factors included prenatal infection (35 cases), hereditary cataracts (22 cases), various syndromes and metabolic disorders (9 cases), trauma (1 case), and unknown (30 cases). Ninety children were diagnosed to have congenital cataracts while 7 acquired them. Findings indicated that prenatal infection continues to be a cause of infantile cataracts, despite rubella immunization; that prematurity is not, as has been stated in the past, a cause of infantile cataract; and that careful neurological, audiological, and developmental examination is vital in the assessment of likely causes of this condition.\r"

Only strabismus, with 676 (38.9%) admissions, accounted for more pediatric hospitalizations for eye injuries. Balls, fists, and sticks were the most common causes of injury, and the most common diagnosis was hyphema. The majority of injuries occurred in children between 11 and 15 years of age (31%). Ocular injuries in children above 10 years of age were most commonly sports-related, whereas injuries in the home accounted for the majority of trauma in children younger than 10 years of age.\r"

Girls had higher preexercise heart rate values than the boys, and showed a marginally slower recovery of diastolic blood pressure values. Black children had significantly lower preexercise and peak exercise heart rate values, higher systolic blood pressure values at peak exercise, and greater systolic blood pressure increases in response to exercise than did white children.

This questionnaire has been shown to reliably distinguish mentally healthy from psychiatrically disturbed populations. Results are presented across three decades (1960s, 1970s, and 1980s), across genders, and across the high school years. A conceptual framework is presented to help the clinician working with adolescents to understand the fluctuation in psychopathology among youth. Adolescent density in the total population is shown to be a significant factor in determining the rate of disturbance among teenagers. Our research findings demonstrate that the rate of behavioral disturbance among adolescents is the same as in other parts of the life cycle. The clinician working with adolescents tends to underestimate the severity of adolescent problems because of the near-universal belief that all adolescents undergo \"adolescent turmoil.\" We have found that adolescents who are experiencing turmoil need professional help.\r"

In chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, proliferated biliary ductular cells had both alpha- and gamma-enolases, but did not express beta-enolase. This is almost the same localization pattern of enolase isozymes as in preexisting bile duct cells. gamma-Enolase was detected in some hepatocytes in eight of 12 cases with chronic active hepatitis and six of 12 cases with cirrhosis. These hepatocytes were small, showed a cobblestone pattern, and binucleate cells were frequent. On the other hand, rosette-formed hepatocytes adjacent to a regenerating bulging lobule were not stained for gamma-enolase. These results suggest that regenerating hepatocytes have gamma-enolase and that, with maturation, hepatocytes lose it.\r"

  ".W": "Manometric studies of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) were done on 17 volunteer subjects and 16 patients with endoscopically evident esophagitis. Subjects entered one or both of two protocols designed to assess the effect of esophageal acid exposure on UES pressure. In protocol 1, continuous 3-h postprandial recordings were obtained; a modified sleeve sensor was used to measure UES pressure, and an intraluminal pH electrode was used to detect occurrences of spontaneous gastroesophageal acid reflux. In protocol 2, UES pressure was continuously monitored during a 10-min control period, followed by a 25-min period of esophageal perfusion with 0.1 N HCl. Our findings were that: 1) basal UES pressure measured during the 3-h recording was similar in the normal volunteers and in the group of patients with esophagitis, 2) episodes of spontaneous gastroesophageal acid reflux were not associated with a change in UES pressure in either the normal volunteers or in the patients with esophagitis, and 3) esophageal perfusion with HCl did not affect the UES pressure in either group, although severe heartburn occurred in most of the esophagitis patients. We conclude that the upper esophageal sphincter exhibits normal basal pressure in patients with esophagitis and that esophageal acid exposure, either spontaneous or experimental, does not affect UES pressure in normal volunteers or in patients with esophagitis.\r"

  ".W": "Dysphagia in the absence of organic esophageal stricture may occur in patients with reflux esophagitis. Although the exact mechanism of this \"nonobstructive dysphagia\" (NOD) is not known, it is believed to be related to transient segmental esophageal motor disorder. The goals of this study were to determine the frequency of NOD in patients with reflux esophagitis and correlate it with esophageal pH and motility changes. Sixty-three consecutive patients with symptoms of esophageal dysfunction were studied with endoscopy, infusion esophageal manometry, and 24-h ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring. Forty-seven had severe erosive esophagitis unresponsive to medical therapy; 16 with esophageal motility disorders were used as symptomatic controls. Twenty-eight of 63 patients studied experienced NOD during the 24-h pH study; 22 had esophagitis and six had esophageal dysmotility without esophagitis. NOD was noted with similar frequency in the two groups; 22/47 (46.8%) of patients with esophagitis and 6/16 (37.5%) with esophageal dysmotility experienced NOD during the period of study. NOD correlated with pH less than 4.0 in 88.6% of patients with esophagitis but in only 7% of patients with esophageal dysmotility (p less than 0.001). There was no difference in acid reflux patterns in esophagitis patients who experienced NOD (22/47), and in those who did not (25/47). There was no correlation between NOD and baseline esophageal motility abnormalities. In summary, 1) NOD is a common, intermittent symptom that occurred in up to 46.8% of esophagitis patients and 37.5% of symptomatic controls during the 24-h period of this study; 2) NOD correlates with esophageal pH less than 4.0 in patients with esophagitis and not in patients with esophageal dysmotility. These data strongly suggest that acid in the distal esophagus frequently triggers the sensation of dysphagia in esophagitis patients, but not in patients with esophageal motility disorders. Combined ambulatory intraesophageal motility and pH monitoring may further elucidate the mechanism of dysphagia in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "High amplitude peristaltic contractions in the distal esophagus (\"nutcracker esophagus\") is the most common manometric disorder seen in patients with noncardiac chest pain. Although this abnormality is found in the distal esophagus, the definition regarding its precise level in the esophagus is unclear. A careful analysis of 99 consecutive manometric tracings performed during a 1-yr period revealed that in patients with noncardiac chest pain and/or dysphagia, the location of the abnormal esophageal contractions varied: 1) in 11 patients the esophageal contractions were abnormal at 2 cm, as well as 7 cm, above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES); 2) the abnormality was limited to the 2-cm location above the LES in six patients; and 3) was confined to the 7-cm location above the LES in five patients. If the conventional criteria of averaging the distal esophageal contraction amplitudes at 2 and 7 cm above the LES were adopted, six of the 11 patients with segmental esophageal contraction abnormality would not have been identified. We suggest that, by inspection of each location of the distal esophagus separately, localized high amplitude contractions can be identified, and the distal 2 cm segment of the esophagus should be routinely included in the manometric evaluation.\r"

A patient was regarded as CP-positive if the culture was positive or if both a urease test and the histology were positive. Blacks had an increased CP positivity (61.2%) compared to whites (31.5%). Among non-ulcer patients, CP positivity was 52% in black patients and 18% in white patients. Age and gender were unrelated to CP positivity among controls and those without ulcers. There was increased CP positivity in patients with duodenal ulcers (85%), compared with those without ulcers (37%), and a trend toward increased positivity in those with gastric ulcer (53%) and duodenitis (50%). There was no increased CP positivity in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (28%), gastritis (29%), non-ulcer dyspepsia (43%), or the control patients with no gastroduodenal mucosal abnormalities (40%). CP-negative DU patients were older (average 71 yr) than CP-positive DU patients (43 yr), and female DU patients had a lower CP positivity (71%) than males (94%).\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between Campylobacter pylori (CP), histologic gastritis, and dyspeptic symptoms is becoming gradually clearer, but there is still a lack of knowledge of the natural history of treated or untreated gastritis. We examined serial biopsies from the gastric fundus, body, and antrum, and from the duodenum in 16 dyspeptic patients. Patients with concomitant peptic ulcers, alcoholism, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use were excluded. CP was present in the biopsies of 50% of patients at presentation. When CP was present, the antrum was always infected, and often had the highest density of organisms. In the duodenum, CP was found only in areas of gastric metaplasia. The presence of CP was highly correlated with gastritis activity (neutrophilic infiltrate). A 4-yr follow-up study of symptoms, endoscopic appearance, and histologic findings including the presence of CP was performed in 10 of the original 16 patients. After 4 yr, both the severity and frequency of epigastric pain remained the same in seven patients, worsened in one, and improved in two. All patients who had CP at initial presentation retained the organism (5/10), whereas none of the previously noninfected patients acquired the infection (5/10). Both CP-positive and -negative patients were treated for 3 wk with 524 mg bismuth subsalicylate qid, and for the first 2 of 3 wk with 250 mg metronidazole qid. One patient who was CP positive was lost to follow-up. In three of the remaining four patients on this regimen, the organism was eradicated. Of the nine patients who completed the treatment program, two had no change in symptoms and seven improved. CP was present in three of seven with improved symptoms and in one of two with no change in symptoms. After treatment, the only change in histology was the disappearance of activity in the CP-positive patients who lost the organism. In conclusion, CP was present in 50% of dyspeptic patients with endoscopic evidence of at least one erosion. Both the symptoms and CP persisted for 4 yr. Dyspeptic symptoms improved after bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole therapy, regardless of the presence or absence of CP, although the regimen did succeed in eradicating the organism in three of the four CP-positive patients who completed the study.\r"

An intermittent source of aluminum contamination was suspected when water aluminum and total dissolved solutes (TDS) were measured at several sites in the water treatment facility of unit A. A one-way valve that maintained unidirectional flow in an RO bypass circuit was found missing. Intermittent pressure changes in this circuit altered the direction of water flow causing mixing of partially purified water with RO water. Installation of the valve stopped contamination and resulted in a decrease in plasma aluminum concentration from 183 +/- 12 micrograms/L to 76 +/- 7.3 micrograms/L, erythrocyte aluminum concentration from 210 +/- 31 micrograms/L to 61 +/- 9 micrograms/L and microcytosis from 58% to 8% in patients (n = 48) when measured 6 months later. Because contamination was missed in spite of water testing at the RO site, these findings underscore the importance of measuring water aluminum and TDS content at the dialysis stations. Frequent water testing at dialysis stations, familiarity with the design of water treatment facilities, and recognition of aluminum overload can lead to early detection and correction if similar types of aluminum contamination should occur.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that race is a predictor of hypertensive renal disease, we examined a general medicine clinic population of 6,880 hypertensive patients who were treated for at least 1 year (mean, 5.2 years). Their mean age was 55.8 years; 70% were women, 72% were black, and 41% were diabetic (95% type II). Many were already under treatment at the time of enrollment. Their mean blood pressure at entry was 150/92 mmHg; during treatment it was 142/86 mmHg. Decreased renal function, defined as a serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL, developed in 18.1%. A multivariable logistic regression analysis identified diabetes, glucose control, systolic blood pressure levels, heart failure, and male gender as indicators of decreased renal function. These data suggested that glucose and blood pressure control may decrease the frequency of impaired renal function. However, when these variables were controlled, blacks still had almost twice the risk for renal dysfunction (91% greater risk) than whites (P less than 0.0001). With increasing creatinine values, the percentage of black patients increased progressively. The data draw attention to and elucidate the exceptionally high incidence of renal dysfunction in blacks with or without diabetes. Further, they may explain the inordinate numbers of blacks with hypertension requiring dialysis. Finally, these retrospective data suggest that prospective trials to test the effect of blood pressure and glucose control on the course of renal disease in hypertensive and/or type II diabetic patients are warranted.\r"
