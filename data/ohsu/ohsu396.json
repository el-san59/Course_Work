Small tumors which cause only eighth nerve symptoms of hearing loss and tinnitus can be followed radiologically while larger tumors with brain stem compression may be subtotally excised through the translabyrinthine route. Our standard treatment for Meniere's disease--that is refractory to medical management--has been vestibular nerve section through a retrolabyrinthine approach. In the event of bilateral Meniere's disease or Meniere's disease in an only hearing ear, treatment with low-dose intramuscular injections of streptomycin sulfate is preferred. Two elderly patients are discussed, each of whom has an acoustic neuroma in one ear and Meniere's disease in the other. These patients' histories, diagnostic evaluations, treatment rationale, and follow-up data are presented to illustrate the decision-making process and the management of complicated and unusual cases.\r"

The repair of large laryngotracheal defects, impossible to reconstruct with segmental resection and end-to-end anastomosis or to repair with existing adjacent tissue, is a challenge. A prerequisite for reconstruction of such defects is a graft composed of well-vascularized mucosal lining and a supportive framework to keep the airway patent. A three-stage procedure, based on the creation of an autogenous mucosal cyst, has been developed and used clinically in a series of patients. The three most recent patients who have undergone reconstruction with pedicled muscle Proplast mucosa grafts are presented. In two of the patients, large unilateral laryngeal tumors were removed and the third had a large patent tracheostoma.\r"

Examination of these organs revealed that there was consistent migration of polytef particles into the cervical lymph nodes, with the highest incidence occurring in upper cervical lymph nodes on the side of injection. There was no evidence of migration of polytef particles to distant sites. The study shows that polytef particles may migrate to cervical lymph nodes after injection into the larynx; however, there is no evidence of distant migration.\r"

From this, many investigators have postulated the existence of endolymphatic hypertension, although there have been no measurements published to substantiate this concept. Seventy guinea pigs, surgically treated with right endolymphatic duct obstruction, were later assessed by use of a micro-electrode technique that measured their endolabyrinthine hydrostatic pressures. For 21 of these animals, the pressures of both scala tympani (Pst) and scala media (Psm) of both ears of each animal were successfully measured. Similar measurements were made in a control group of 25 guinea pigs that had not undergone any previous surgery. For normal ears--as well as those with hydrops-pressure differences between perilymph and endolymph (Psm - Pst) varied around 0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg. When only the right (obstructed) ears were considered, there appeared to be a slight, relative pressure elevation (p less than 0.05) in scala media during the first 7 days after endolymphatic duct obstruction-and in those ears with EP, less than 70 mV. The magnitude of this pressure difference that can be attributed to the state of endolymphatic hydrops-and not to natural variability-is calculated (within 95% confidence limits) to be less than 0.5 mm Hg.\r"

Saline-treated control animals (Group 1) were compared with two experimental groups. In Group 2, deferoxamine 150 mg/kg was administered 15 minutes before surgery and every 8 hours for 5 days. In Group 3, deferoxamine was given every 8 hours for 3 days before surgery and every 8 hours for 5 days postoperatively. Flap necrosis was assessed on postoperative day 5. Group 2 had significantly less necrosis, 18.6%, than the control group, 64.0% (p less than 0.001). Group 3, with 36.0% necrosis, also showed improvement (p less than 0.05). Group 2 and Group 3 were not significantly different. Deferoxamine, a safe and well-tolerated free radical scavenger, greatly enhanced flap survival, presumably by the neutralization of damaging free radical species and by chelation of iron.\r"

The AP tuning curves, obtained by a simultaneous masking procedure, were also similar to previously measured tuning curves in the chinchilla. These results indicate that long-term indwelling electrodes can be successfully placed on the chinchilla round window and used to measure threshold sensitivity and frequency selectivity.

To determine if preoperative neurophysiologic testing might predict postoperative facial function after tumor surgery, preoperative facial electroneurography (ENoG) was performed in 82 patients with confirmed tumors of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle. In patients with acoustic neuroma, preoperative ENoG amplitude reduction varied directly with tumor size. In addition, a statistically significant association between impaired postoperative facial function and acoustic neuroma size greater than 2.5 cm was found. However, preoperative ENoG amplitude reduction did not accurately predict postoperative facial function. These findings suggest that factors, such as the type and size of tumor, the microanatomic relationship between the facial nerve and the neoplasm, and/or desynchronization of the evoked motor-unit volley, may effect results obtained with ENoG in this setting.\r"

Surgical exploration confirmed involvement of the fallopian canal in the perigeniculate region in 14 longitudinal and 3 transverse or mixed fractures of the petrous pyramid. Gunshot and iatrogenic injuries usually occurred within the tympanic and vertical segments of the facial canal and at the stylomastoid foramen. When hearing is salvageable, the middle fossa approach provides the best access to the perigeniculate region of the facial nerve. In the presence of severe sensorineural hearing loss, the transmastoid-translabyrinthine approach is the most appropriate for total facial nerve exploration. Grade I to III results can be anticipated in timely decompression of lesions caused by edema or intraneural hemorrhage. Undetectable at the time of surgery, stretch and compression injuries with disruption of the endoneural tubules often lead to suboptimal results. Moderate-to-severe dysfunction (Grade IV), with slight weakness and synkinesis, is the outcome to be expected from the use of interpositional grafts.\r"

Advances in instrumentation because of technologic changes, coupled with better surgical training, have contributed to a highly successful rate of tumor removal. The capability to extirpate the tumor now permits the otologic surgeon to attempt simultaneous preservation of the facial and cochlear nerve functions. Just as middle ear surgery improved to the point in the 1950s that reconstruction as well as disease eradication became possible, so can surgeons now consider preservation of function of the inner ear. It is now technically feasible--in some instances--to attempt to preserve hearing in tumors of the eighth nerve. Several studies have provided evidence that the cochlear nerve can be anatomically and functionally preserved when neuromas involve either the inferior or superior vestibular nerves. However, other studies assert that grossly intact nerves may contain microscopic islands of tumor cells intermingled with nerve fibers. If viable tumor cells were allowed to remain behind, one would expect them to grow; this would result in loss of hearing function and tumor recurrence, as evidenced by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This article will discuss the issues of cochlear nerve preservation and tumor excision, and review our experience over the past decade.\r"

  ".W": "A distinction between benign, preneoplastic, and malignant tissue, based upon the expression of surface antigens, would provide useful clinical information. Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) has been reported in squamous cell carcinomas, but not in normal squamous epithelium. Twenty-nine specimens from 15 patients, representative of the spectra of changes seen in squamous cell epithelium from normal through dysplasia to squamous cell carcinoma, were fixed in B-5 and examined with anti-EMA monoclonal antibody in an immunoperoxidase technique. Normal squamous epithelium does express EMA. Squamous cell carcinoma also expresses EMA. Well-differentiated tumors stain more intensely and in greater numbers of cells than less-differentiated tumors. The presence or absence of EMA expression does not distinguish normal squamous epithelium from carcinoma. Investigations of membrane antigen content in fixed tissue must use methods of fixation that preserve antigenicity. While strict quantitation of immunoperoxidase preparations is not possible, quantitative differences in expression may be important.\r"

The RSG-IAC involves a 3 cm retrosigmoid craniotomy removal of the posterior wall of the internal auditory canal (IAC) to the singular canal, with transection of the superior vestibular nerve and the posterior ampullary nerve. This effects a complete denervation of the vestibular labyrinth and preserves the patient's hearing. All 11 patients with Meniere's disease were cured of vertigo. Hearing was preserved to within 10 dB of the preoperative pure-tone average (PTA) in 9 of 11 cases. There were no serious complications and no cases of facial paralysis or total hearing loss. The major postoperative problem is persistent headache that necessitates medication. These results compare favorably with--and may be better than those noted after--the RVN procedure. The RSG-IAC vestibular neurectomy is an important improvement in the evolution of vestibular neurectomy for the treatment of vertigo. A prospective study is now in progress to determine which procedure--the RSG-IAC or RVN--best fulfills the goals of vestibular neurectomy.\r"

Forty patients had adequate follow-up for determination of cancer control rates. Local control was successful with initial treatment in 85% of the cases. The incidence of lymph node metastases was 10%, whereas distant metastasis occurred in only one patient (2.5%). This series differs from others in that most patients were unselected and most of the lesions treated were early (less than 1 cm).

With our current sample, larger experience, and more prolonged follow-up, we noted that symptomatic granulation tissue formation, with or without wound infection, occurred more frequently than was initially appreciated. In 21% (10 of 47) of the cases, the only way to resolve this problem was to remove this device and replace it permanently with a metal (or other type) tracheostomy tube. Other complications included tracheal narrowing and cannula malpositioning and fragmentation.

  ".W": "A 36-year-old man was thought (for 20 years) to have an arteriovenous malformation that could not be excised. Repeated ligations of proximal arterial supply to the vascular lesion were only transiently beneficial and may have caused a delay in correct diagnosis because of impaired angioaccess. Once it was discovered that he had an arteriovenous fistula--probably caused by a tonsillectomy at age 6--it was possible to occlude the fistula with detachable balloons. The mass and his headaches subsequently resolved. AV fistulas are caused by trauma. Growth of AVMs is often stimulated by trauma. Both lesions have pulsatile masses associated with overlying bruits. The differential diagnosis can usually be made by arteriography, since AV fistulas are acquired lesions with a single communication between an artery and a vein, whereas AVMs are congenital lesions with multiple, large arterial feeding vessels and numerous arteriovenous communications. Proper diagnosis is important, since AVMs are aggressive lesions that tend to regrow if not completely excised. AV fistulas will be cured if the single arteriovenous communication can be obliterated. Proper treatment for AV fistula is obliteration of the single arteriovenous communication, operatively or with occlusive balloons; treatment of AVMs--when possible--is excision of the entire mass, combined (on occasion) with preoperative embolization of the tumor mass. This case report emphasizes the importance of accuracy in the differential diagnosis between arteriovenous malformations and arteriovenous fistulas; moreover, it demonstrates both the ineffectiveness and deleterious consequences of proximal arterial ligation, since collateral development is enhanced and angiographic access is compromised.\r"

  ".W": "We have presented three cases of metastatic tumor to the orbit. The first case illustrated metastatic tumor that originated from a cutaneous basosquamous cell carcinoma. This lesion, first reported by MacCormac as being morphologically intermediate between basal and squamous cell carcinoma, has become a topic of some controversy. Conley reported these tumors to represent 1% of basal cell carcinomas. Several authors have reported a higher incidence of recurrence with these lesions, as compared with the ordinary basal cell tumors. Recurrence of basal cell carcinomas are reported as approximately 10%, but are four times greater in the basosquamous cell tumors. The incidence of metastasis with the basosquamous cell tumors has been reported in between 37% and 51% of cases. The second case represented involvement of the orbit by direct extension of a facial squamous cell carcinoma. As illustrated by this case, these tumors can be very aggressive and should be treated with respect. The third case showed the metastatic potential of the nephroblastoma with metastatic tumor that involved the eye, orbit, and maxilla. Diagnostic techniques available in evaluation of these tumors include CT scan, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, ultrasound, open biopsy, and fine-needle aspiration. Li et al., in an article that compared MR imaging, CT scan, and ultrasound concluded that MR imaging, with the use of the 0.15 T resistive magnet, offered no distinct advantage over the combination of CT and ultrasound in evaluation of patients with orbital tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

TRH has previously been shown to be active against both these stimuli. TRH-OH showed an antinociceptive action against both stimuli, while cyclo(His-Pro) had a dose-dependent effect only against a mechanical stimulus. Both metabolites of TRH were less effective than TRH. The antinociception induced by TRH does not appear to depend on the biotransformation of TRH to its metabolites since they are less active than TRH itself.\r"

Infants in both groups received 90 mL/kg of fluid per day. There was no difference in blood glucose or serum insulin levels between the two groups 24 hours after beginning the infusion; however, at 48 hours there was a significantly (P less than .01) higher insulin level in infants receiving amino acid and glucose infusion compared with those receiving only glucose. Blood glucose level remained stable in both groups. We conclude that, in the stable preterm infant, the higher insulin level associated with continuous amino acid infusion does not result in hypoglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "In the past two decades, 853 children and adolescents have been evaluated for elevated BP as inpatients and outpatients by the hypertension service at Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati. Most children with hypertension secondary to coarctation of the aorta and all children with glomerulonephritis are managed by other services and are not included in that total. In a retrospective study, 27 children (3%) were identified as having hypertension secondary to intrinsic renal arterial stenosis. The age at presentation ranged from 5 months to 20 years. The mean BP at that time was 171.6/114.2 mm Hg. Ten categories of causes were identified, including fibromuscular dysplasia, arteritis, Williams syndrome, neurofibromatosis, congenital malformations, blunt abdominal trauma, surgical vascular trauma-irradiation, thrombosis, congenital rubella syndrome, and unknown. Overall, symptoms were not common. However, findings of end-organ response, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and retinal vascular abnormalities were prevalent. This is not surprising given the mean BP level at presentation. Physical examination, laboratory tests, and radiologic evaluations (exclusive of renal angiography) were not useful in detecting or identifying the location and extent of the renovascular lesions. Fourteen patients were treated surgically, and 13 were managed medically. The outcome was variable for both treatment modalities. The management of renovascular hypertension in children must be individualized depending on the cause, location, and severity of the lesion, as well as the size of the child. Some forms of renovascular pathology, particularly the arteritides, may resolve spontaneously, and children with these entities should have their BP treated medically until the inflammatory process has subsided.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mechanism of this activation is unknown and particularly puzzling because adenylyl cyclase is confined to the basal lateral membrane of enterocytes, whereas it is the brush border membrane that binds the toxin and contains proteins that undergo cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation. It is shown that cholate extracts from cholera toxin-treated brush border membranes can efficiently reconstitute adenylyl cyclase activity in the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component (Gs)-deficient cyc- variant of the S49 mouse lymphoma cell line (cyc- cells lack the alpha subunit of Gs needed to activate the catalytic subunit of adenylyl cyclase). Moreover, NaF (in the presence of Al3+) and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate mediate strong activation of cyc- adenylyl cyclase provided the cholate extracts of brush border membranes are also present. Therefore, it appears that brush border membranes contain high levels of regulatory subunits of adenylyl cyclase in the absence of catalytic subunits. This represents a previously unrecognized feature of this transduction system that presumably plays an important role in the derangement of intestinal cell function by cholera toxin.\r"

Arachidonic acid, 2-arachidonoyl sn-phosphatidylcholine, or 2-arachidonoyl sn-phosphatidylethanolamine did not serve as substrate for the production of compound A. The reaction required Ca2+ and was not affected by aspirin, indomethacin, or mepacrin. Enzyme activity was not enhanced in the presence of NADPH, but it was inhibited greater than 90% by CO or N2; inhibition was readily reversible by exposure to atmospheric air. Neither metapyrone (SKF 525A) nor cyanide, inhibitors of cytochrome P-450, inhibited compound A formation, suggesting that a cytochrome P-450 system was not involved. Thrombin stimulated the formation of compound A in whole platelets; ionophore A23187 did so much less effectively; and other agonists such as collagen, ADP, and epinephrine were ineffective. Compound A exhibited a fragmentation pattern by GC/MS identical to that of authentic cis-14,15-oxido-5,8,11-icosatrienoic acid. Collectively, these data indicate that human platelets may contain an enzyme system that catalyzes the epoxidation of the arachidonic acid moiety of phosphatidylinositol and its hydrolysis to liberate cis-14,15-oxido-5,8,11-icosatrienoic acid.\r"

Complexes with DNA fragments from four kappa light-chain joining (J) segments have the same electrophoretic mobility. Nonamer-containing DNA fragments from heavy-chain and light-chain genes compete for binding. Within the 5'-flanking DNA of the J kappa 4 gene segment, the binding site has been localized to a 27-base-pair interval spanning the nonamer region. The binding activity is recovered as a single peak after ion-exchange chromatography. The site of binding of the protein and its presence in nuclei of lymphoid cells suggest that it may function in the assembly of immunoglobulin genes.\r"

Infrared spectra in the amide I region were analyzed quantitatively using deconvolution and band-fitting procedures. According to this analysis, in aqueous solution the monomeric peptide has a random structure. Binding to bilayer vesicles of dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol results in drastic conformational changes. The lipid-complexed atriopeptin III adopts a highly ordered structure of predominantly beta-sheets. A transition to a similar, but not identical, beta-structure occurs upon self-association of the peptide. The results of model experiments suggest that the binding of this atrial peptide to the target cell membrane is associated with the induction of beta-sheet structure and that it is this latter conformation that is predominant in the active form of the hormone.\r"

  ".U": "88041051\r", 
  ".W": "Under anaerobic conditions where the nitroaromatic radiation-sensitizer misonidazole substitutes for dioxygen, DNA strand breakage (gaps with phosphate residues at each end) by the nonprotein chromophore of the antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin (NCS-Chrom) is associated with the generation of a reactive form of formate from the C-5' of deoxyribose of thymidylate residues. Such lesions account for a minority (10-15%) of the strand breakage found in the aerobic reaction without misonidazole. Amino-containing nucleophiles such as tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) and hydroxylamine act as acceptors for the activated formate. The amount of [3H]formyl hydroxamate produced from DNA labeled with [5'-3H]thymidine is comparable to the spontaneously released thymine. During the course of the reaction, misonidazole undergoes a DNA-dependent reduction and subsequent conjugation with glutathione used to activate NCS-Chrom. From these and earlier results, we propose a possible mechanism in which the carbon-centered radical formed at C-5' by hydrogen atom abstraction by thiol-activated NCS-Chrom reacts anaerobically with misonidazole to form a nitroxyl-radical-adduct intermediate, which fragments to produce an oxy radical at C-5'. beta-Fragmentation results in cleavage between C-5' and C-4' with the generation of 3'-formyl phosphate-ended DNA, a high-energy form of formate, which spontaneously hydrolyzes, releasing formate and creating a 3'-phosphate end, or transfers the formyl moiety to available nucleophiles. A similar mechanism, involving dioxygen addition, is probably responsible for the 10-15% DNA gap formation in the aerobic reaction.\r"

  ".U": "88041069\r", 
  ".W": "A probe derived from the 3' region of the BCR gene (breakpoint cluster region gene) detects four distinct loci in the human genome. One of the loci corresponds to the complete BCR gene, whereas the others contain a 3' segment of the gene. After HindIII cleavage of human DNA, these four loci are detected as 23-, 19-, 13-, and 9-kilobase-pair fragments, designated BCR4, BCR3, BCR2, and BCR1, respectively, with BCR1 deriving from the original complete BCR gene. All four BCR loci segregate 100% concordantly with human chromosome 22 in a rodent-human somatic cell hybrid panel and are located at chromosome region 22q11.2 by chromosomal in situ hybridization. The BCR2 and BCR4 loci are amplified in leukemia cell line K562 cells, indicating that they fall within the amplification unit that includes immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus (IGL) and ABL locus on the K562 Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1); additionally, in chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived mouse-human hybrids retaining a Ph1 chromosome in the absence of the 9q+ and normal chromosome 22, BCR2 and BCR4 loci are retained, whereas the 3' region of BCR1 and the BCR3 locus are lost, indicating that BCR3 is distal to BCR1 on chromosome 22. Similarly, in mouse-human hybrids retaining a Ph1 chromosome derived from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia-in the absence of the 9q+ and 22, only BCR2 and BCR4 loci are retained, indicating that the breakpoint in this acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as in chronic myelogenous leukemia, is proximal to the BCR1 3' region, but distal to the IGLC locus and the BCR2 and BCR4 3' loci. Thus, the order of loci on chromosome 22 is centromere----BCR2, BCR4, and IGL----BCR1----BCR3----SIS, possibly eliminating BCR2 and BCR4 loci as candidate targets for juxtaposition to the ABL gene in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia Ph1 chromosome.\r"

A DNA rearrangement involving the genes encoding apoAI and apoCIII in certain patients with premature atherosclerosis has been associated with deficiency of both apoAI and apoCIII in the plasma of these patients. Structural characterization of the genes for apoAI and apoCIII in one of these patients indicates that this rearrangement consists of a DNA inversion containing portions of the 3' ends of the apoAI and apoCIII genes, including the DNA region between these genes. The breakpoints of this DNA inversion are located within the fourth exon of the apoAI gene and the first intron of the apoCIII gene. Thus, this DNA inversion results in reciprocal fusion of the apoAI and apoCIII gene transcriptional units. Expression of these gene fusions in cultured mammalian cells results in stable mRNA transcripts with sequences representing fusions of the apoAI and apoCIII mRNAs. These results indicate that absence of transcripts with correct apoAI and apoCIII mRNA sequences causes apoAI and apoCIII deficiency in the plasma of these patients and suggest that these apolipoproteins are involved in cholesterol homeostasis and protection against premature atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Studies on human cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been limited by a paucity of molecular genetic techniques available for manipulating the viral genome. We have developed methods for site-specific insertion and deletion mutagenesis of CMV utilizing a modified Escherichia coli lacZ gene as a genetic marker. The lacZ gene was placed under the control of the major beta gene regulatory signals and inserted into the viral genome by homologous recombination, disrupting one of two copies of this beta gene within the L-component repeats of CMV DNA. We observed high-level expression of beta-galactosidase by the recombinant in a temporally authentic manner, with levels of this enzyme approaching 1% of total protein in infected cells. Thus, CMV is an efficient vector for high-level expression of foreign gene products in human cells. Using back selection of lacZ-deficient virus in the presence of the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactoside, we generated random endpoint deletion mutants. Analysis of these mutants revealed that CMV DNA sequences flanking the insert had been removed, thereby establishing this approach as a means of determining whether sequences flanking a lacZ insertion are dispensable for viral growth. In an initial test of the methods, we have shown that 7800 base pairs of one copy of L-component repeat sequences can be deleted without affecting viral growth in human fibroblasts.\r"

  ".U": "88041079\r", 
  ".W": "The immunological function of major histocompatibility complex molecules, including HLA class I molecules, is to present antigens and/or their processed peptides to various lymphocyte subpopulations. Thus, they play a pivotal role in regulatory interactions between cells of the immune system, which can result in the activation and function of T cells. We looked for a role of major histocompatibility complex molecules during T-cell activation induced by monoclonal antibody (mAb) or combinations of mAb recognizing the two well-characterized T-cell surface molecules CD3 and CD2. To activate T-cell peripheral blood lymphocytes, we used a CD3 mAb or two different pairs of CD2 mAb, CD2 \"GT2 + T11(1)\" and CD2 \"D66 + T11(1),\" which, as we have previously shown, deliver different signals of activation to T cells. Anti-HLA class I mAb blocked the activation induced by CD3 mAb or by CD2 GT2 + T11(1), but it did not block activation induced by CD2 D66 + T11(1). We observed this pattern of inhibition according to the stimulus used to activate T cells both when the anti-HLA class I mAbs were added to cultures of whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells and when they were fixed to monocytes only. In the latter case, purified monocytes were first incubated with the anti-HLA mAb (whether whole immunoglobulin or Fab fragment) and then fixed with paraformaldehyde before culture with autologous purified T cells. Anti-HLA class I fixed on monocytes prevented both interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor expression and IL-2 synthesis on T cells. The inhibitory effects of anti-class I mAb bound to monocytes were not reversed by adding large amounts of recombinant IL-2 or recombinant IL-1, a finding consistent with the observations that accessory cells surface components can fully complement the signals directly delivered to T cells by CD2 or CD3 mAb. We conclude that HLA class I from accessory cells plays an important role in the early phase of T-cell activation when direct contacts between accessory cells and T cells are required.\r"

Single-copy hybridization probes isolated from these cosmid clusters and probes for the known MHC gene loci were hybridized to Southern blots of genomic DNA that had been digested with infrequently cutting restriction endonucleases and separated on pulsed-field gels. The data obtained allowed the construction of a long-range genomic restriction map and indicated that the MHC spans 3800 kb. This map orients the MHC class III gene cluster with respect to the DR subregion; the C2 gene is on the telomeric side of the 21-hydroxylase B gene. In addition we have defined the positions of the genes for the tumor necrosis factors alpha and beta in the human MHC. Genes for the alpha chain of DR and 21-hydroxylase B are separated by at least 300 kb, while the distance between the genes for C2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha is 390 kb. The HLA-B locus lies approximately equal to 250 kb on the telomeric side of the tumor necrosis factor genes.\r"

Measles virus induces Ia on rat astrocytes by direct interaction with these cells. TNF does not induce significant levels of Ia at any dose from 1 to 10,000 units/ml. As little as 10 units of TNF per ml, however, amplifies Ia-inducing signals generated by measles virus in astrocytes. In contrast, TNF and measles virus induce class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, when applied individually, and TNF amplification of measles virus class I MHC induction is not apparent. The induction of either Ia or class I MHC antigens on rat astrocytes by measles virus does not depend on glial-derived soluble factors generated during infection. Since brain cells are normally lacking MHC antigens upon which T cells depend for interaction with antigen presenting cells, these data indicate that the ability of measles virus to directly stimulate MHC antigen expression and the ability of TNF to amplify Ia expression locally in the brain may be important in initiating cell-mediated immune response to viral infection.\r"

  ".U": "88041084\r", 
  ".W": "Two monoclonal antibodies (OKT27 and OKT27b) have been produced that react with distinct epitopes of a 95-kDa peptide. The T27 antigen is widely distributed, being expressed on B lymphocytes, monocytes, and adult T-leukemic cells but not on polymorphonuclear leukocytes or platelets. There was a low level of T27 expression on resting T cells that increased on T-cell activation. In preliminary studies, the OKT27b antibody coprecipitated a 55-kDa peptide, as well as the 95-kDa peptide, from the radiolabeled cells of the HuT 102B2 cell line. Preclearance with anti-Tac, a monoclonal antibody to the 55-kDa peptide of the multichain interleukin 2 receptor, removed the 55-kDa but not the 95-kDa peptide from subsequent OKT27b immunoprecipitates of HuT 102B2 extracts, suggesting the possibility that the T27 peptide was associated with the Tac peptide. However, the precipitation of the p55 Tac peptide by OKT27b was quite inconsistent. Thus, additional information was sought using a flow cytometric energy transfer technique to provide a physical estimation of the proximity between the Tac and the T27 peptides. The flow cytometric version of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique permits the determination of inter- and intramolecular distances at 2- to 10-nm levels on a cell-by-cell basis. Using this approach, there was a mean energy transfer of 7.3% with HuT 102B2 cells when fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-Tac served as the donor and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate OKT27 served as the acceptor. In contrast, there was no energy transfer in comparable studies observed when fluorescein anti-Tac and rhodamine anti-transferrin receptor antibodies were used. These observations support the conclusion that there is a close nonrandom proximity in HuT 102B2 cells between the 95-kDa peptide identified by the OKT27 monoclonal antibody and the p55 Tac peptide of the multichain interleukin 2 receptor.\r"

S1 nuclease analysis indicates that both long and short forms of Gs alpha mRNA are decreased, with no apparent change in the ratio of long to short forms in PHP compared with normal individuals.

  ".W": "Plasma prorenin and active renin were measured before and after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration in two groups of patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for 4-6 days with follicle-stimulating hormone alone or in combination with luteinizing hormone, for in vitro fertilization. Baseline total plasma renin (prorenin plus active renin; n = 12) averaged 25 +/- 8 ng/ml per hr (mean +/- SD). Total renin did not change during ovarian stimulation but it increased to 46 +/- 16 ng/ml per hr (P less than 0.05) 1 or 2 days later, just before hCG administration. Thirty-six hours after hCG administration, just before laparoscopy and egg retrieval, total renin was 123 +/- 97 ng/ml per hr; a peak of 182 +/- 143 ng/ml per hr occurred 2-6 days later--i.e., during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In eight of the patients who did not conceive, total renin returned to baseline 14 days after hCG administration. In four who conceived, a nadir was reached (57 +/- 13 ng/ml per hr) 8-12 days after hCG administration and then total renin increased again as the plasma beta hCG measurement began to rise. By day 16 it averaged 225 +/- 157 ng/ml per hr. In a second group of five patients active renin and prorenin were measured separately. Active renin comprised less than 20% of the total renin at all times. It was unchanged until day 4 after hCG administration and then increased significantly only when plasma progesterone was high. Thus, the initial response to hCG was entirely due to an increase in prorenin. A highly significant correlation was observed between the number of follicles and the total renin increases on the day of aspiration (r = 0.93, P less than 0.001) and at the peak (r = 0.89, P less than 0.001). After hCG administration, a temporal relationship was observed between the rise in total renin and plasma estradiol and progesterone levels. These results demonstrate that plasma prorenin increases markedly after administration of hCG and that the rise is directly related to the number of ovarian follicles and to plasma estrogen and progesterone levels. The findings suggest that prorenin is produced by the mature ovarian follicle and by the corpus luteum in response to gonadotropin stimulation.\r"

TRH mRNA levels were measured by quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry using a 35S-labeled synthetic 48-base oligodeoxynucleotide probe and quantitative autoradiography. Chemical thyroidectomy, produced by the administration of 6-(n-propyl)-2-thiouracil (PrSur), reduced plasma thyroxine below detection limits and significantly increased TRH mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus. Treatment with exogenous L-triiodothyronine (T3) reduced TRH mRNA to the same level in both hypothyroid and euthyroid animals. Neither PrSur treatment nor T3 replacement influenced TRH mRNA levels in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. Blot hybridization analysis of electrophoretically fractionated total RNA from pituitaries of these animals indicated that thyrotropin-beta mRNA levels were elevated after thyroidectomy and reduced by T3 treatment, showing that the pituitary-thyroid axis was indeed stimulated by PrSur treatment. These results suggest that thyroid hormones are involved, either directly or indirectly, in regulating the biosynthesis of TRH in the thyrotropic center of the hypothalamus.\r"

However, when Ca2+ was added to homogenization buffers at 0-1 mM in excess of EDTA, increasing quantities of the enzyme were recovered in the microsomal membrane fraction (100,000 X g pellet). The membrane-associated enzyme was resolubilized by washing pellet preparations in buffers containing 2 mM EDTA and was partially purified by anion-exchange chromatography. Studies of the stimulatory-factor requirements of the membrane-associated, resolubilized, and partially purified enzyme indicated that one of the cytosolic 5-lipoxygenase stimulatory factors exhibited a reversible, Ca2+-dependent membrane association, similar to that of the enzyme itself. Ca2+ also caused a destabilization of the 5-lipoxygenase. Homogenates prepared in the presence of Ca2+ contained lower total enzyme activity, and retention of activity in these samples over time was also diminished.\r"

  ".W": "The organization of the insulin gene of the owl or night monkey (Aotus trivirgatus), a New World primate, is similar to that of the human gene. The sequences of these two genes and flanking regions possess 84.3% homology. An unusual feature of the owl monkey gene is the partial duplication and insertion of a portion of the A-chain coding sequence into the 3' untranslated region. The insulin gene of this primate also lacks a region of tandem repeats that is present in the 5' flanking region of the human and chimpanzee genes. Owl monkey preproinsulin has 85.5% identity with the human insulin precursor and is the most divergent of the primate insulins/preproinsulins yet described. The differences between owl monkey and human preproinsulin include three substitutions in the signal peptide, two in the B chain, seven in the C peptide, and three in the A chain. One of these replacements is the conservative substitution of valine for isoleucine at position A2, an invariant site in all other vertebrate insulins and insulin-like growth factors. The substitutions in owl monkey insulin at B9, B27, A2, A4, and A17 alter its structure so that it has only 20% of the receptor-binding activity and 1% of the affinity with guinea pig anti-porcine insulin antibodies as compared to human insulin.\r"

Catalase activity in wild-type flies is demonstrable in bodies of appearance and centrifugal behavior comparable to the peroxisomes of vertebrate tissues. Xanthine oxidase (xanthine:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.3.22) activity of the Malpighian tubule of wild-type flies is demonstrable cytochemically in bodies like those containing catalase. The rosy-506 mutant flies, with a deletion in the structural gene for xanthine dehydrogenase (xanthine:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.204), lack cytochemically demonstrable peroxisomal xanthine oxidase activity. In addition, peroxisomes in the rosy-506 mutants show less intense cytochemical staining for catalase than those in wild-type flies, and biochemical assays indicate that catalase in the rosy mutant is much more accessible to substrate in the absence of detergent than in the wild type. Thus, the rosy-506 mutation appears to affect peroxisomes and may mimic aspects of the defects of peroxisomes in some human metabolic disorders.\r"

The cDNA inserts from 13 of the 16 clones cross-hybridized with each other, indicating that they were from related mRNA species. One of the cDNA clones, Pmel34, detected one mRNA species with an approximate length of 2.4 kilobases that was expressed preferentially in normal and malignant melanocytes but not in other cell types. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence showed that the putative human tyrosinase is composed of 548 amino acids with a molecular weight of 62,610. The deduced protein contains glycosylation sites and histidine-rich sites that could be used for copper binding. Southern blot analysis of DNA derived from newborn mice carrying lethal albino deletion mutations revealed that Pmel34 maps near or at the c-albino locus, the position of the structural gene for tyrosinase.\r"

This technique detects, in extracts of a human astrocytoma cell line, the alpha subunits of Gs (stimulatory) (alpha 45 and alpha 52), a 41-kDa subunit of Gi (inhibitory) (alpha 41), a 40-kDa protein (alpha 40), and the 36-kDa beta subunit. No protein that comigrated with the alpha subunit of Go (unknown function) (alpha 39) was detected. In cells grown in the presence of [3H]myristic acid, alpha 41 and alpha 40 contained 3H label, while the beta subunit did not. Chemical analysis of lipids attached covalently to purified alpha 41 and alpha 39 from bovine brain also revealed myristic acid. Similar analysis of brain G protein beta and gamma subunits and of Gt (transducin) subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) failed to reveal fatty acids. The fatty acid associated with alpha 41, alpha 40, and alpha 39 was stable to treatment with base, suggesting that the lipid is linked to the polypeptide via an amide bond. These GTP binding proteins are thus identified as members of a select group of proteins that contains myristic acid covalently attached to the peptide backbone. Myristate may play an important role in stabilizing interactions of G proteins with phospholipid or with membrane-bound proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Myoglobin-mediated oxygen delivery to intracellular mitochondria is demonstrated in cardiac myocytes isolated from the hearts of mature rats. Myocytes are held at high ambient oxygen pressure, 40-340 torr (5-45 kPa); sarcoplasmic myoglobin is fully oxygenated. In this condition oxygen availability does not limit respiratory rate; myoglobin-facilitated diffusion contributes no additional oxygen flux and, since oxygen consumption is measured in steady states, the storage function of myoglobin vanishes. Carbon monoxide, introduced stepwise, displaces oxygen from intracellular oxymyoglobin without altering the optical spectrum of the largely oxidized intracellular mitochondria. A large part, about one-third, of the steady-state oxygen uptake is abolished by carbon monoxide blockade of myoglobin oxygenation. The myoglobin-dependent component of the oxygen uptake decreases linearly with decreasing fraction of intracellular oxymyoglobin, with a slope near unity. Studies using inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport indicate that myoglobin-delivered oxygen uptake depends on electron flow through the mitochondrial electron transport chain. We conclude that cardiac mitochondria accept two additive simultaneous flows of oxygen: a flow of dissolved oxygen to cytochrome oxidase and a flow of myoglobin-bound oxygen to a mitochondrial terminus. Myoglobin-mediated oxygen delivery supports ATP generation by heart cells at physiological ambient oxygen pressure.\r"

  ".U": "88041137\r", 
  ".W": "The amino acid sequences surrounding three major phosphorylation sites in rat and bovine synapsin I have been determined by employing automated gas-phase sequencing and manual Edman degradation of purified phosphopeptide fragments. Site 1 is a serine residue phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I. The sequence around site 1 was derived from tryptic/chymotryptic phosphopeptides and overlapping cyanogen bromide cleavage fragments. This sequence, identical in rat and bovine synapsin I, is Asn-Tyr-Leu-Arg-Arg-Arg-Leu-Ser(P)-Asp-Ser-Asn-Phe-Met. Site 1 is located at the NH2 terminus of the protein, within the collagenase-resistant head region. Sites 2 and 3 are serine residues phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. The sequences surrounding bovine site 2 and site 3 were derived from tryptic phosphopeptides and overlapping fragments generated by cleavage with chymotrypsin, collagenase, and endoproteinase Lys-C. The sequence around bovine site 2 is Thr-Arg-Gln-Thr-Ser(P)-Val-Ser-Gly-Gln-Ala-Pro-Pro-Lys, and the sequence around bovine site 3 is Thr-Arg-Gln-Ala-Ser(P)-Gln-Ala-Gly-Pro-Met-Pro-Arg. Sites 2 and 3 are located within the COOH-terminal, collagenase-sensitive tail region of the molecule, separated by 36 amino acids. The sequences surrounding rat site 2 and site 3 were derived from tryptic phosphopeptides. The sequence around rat site 2 is Gln-Ala-Ser(P)-Ile-Ser-Gly-Pro-Ala-Pro-Pro-Lys, and the sequence around rat site 3 is Gln-Ala-Ser(P)-Gln-Ala-Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro-Arg. Thus, the sequences surrounding the four sites that are phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, namely sites 2 and 3 in rat and bovine synapsin I, exhibit a high degree of homology.\r"

Covalent myristoylation of the membrane and secretory forms of immunoglobulin heavy chains as well as of light chains was observed in B cells. Myristoylation of the membrane immunoglobulin heavy chain correlates with its transport to the cell surface and its post-translational conversion to a relatively hydrophobic form. This post-translational modification is hydroxylamine resistant and may be responsible for the assembly and transport of membrane immunoglobulin to the cell surface in B cells.\r"

Purification by two affinity-chromatography steps yielded tPA-anti-fibrin antibody conjugate (tPA-59D8) possessing both tPA and anti-fibrin antibody activities. In a quantitative rabbit thrombolysis model, the activity of the purified conjugate was compared with that of tPA alone and that of a conjugate between tPA and a digoxin-specific monoclonal antibody. After correction for spontaneous lysis (10.9 +/- 2.5%), tPA-59D8 was shown to be 2.8-9.6 times more potent than tPA alone. Unconjugated tPA and tPA-digoxin were equipotent. At equivalent thrombolytic concentrations, tPA-59D8 degraded less fibrinogen and consumed less alpha 2-antiplasmin than did tPA alone. This suggests that tPA can be efficiently directed to the site of a thrombus by conjugation to an anti-fibrin monoclonal antibody, resulting in both more potent and more selective thrombolysis.\r"

The specific activity (14.0 nmol/min per mg of protein) was 6- to 7-fold higher than that in the central nervous system. The enzyme showed full activity with 1 mM glutathione, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, or 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and was almost completely inhibited by 1 mM 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. The Km value for prostaglandin H2 was about 20 microM. These catalytic properties are the same as those of rat brain prostaglandin D synthetase but different from those of rat spleen prostaglandin D synthetase. The activity decreased to less than 20% of its initial level after incubation with excess amounts of a polyclonal or a monoclonal antibody against the brain enzyme, but the activity remained unchanged with a polyclonal antibody against the spleen enzyme, indicating that the brain-type enzyme synthesizes prostaglandin D2 in the cochlea. When cryosections of 5-week-old (adult) rat cochleas were stained by an immunoperoxidase method with antibodies against the brain enzyme, the immunoreactivity was found in inner and outer hair cells, Claudius' cells, Deiters' cells, marginal cells, basal cells, and cells of Reissner's membrane. In 8-day-old rats, the immunoreactivity was found in all of these cell types except hair cells. The immunoreactivity in hair cells was found in only one specimen from 9-day-old animals, and no immunoreactivity was found in spiral ganglion cells at any of the ages examined. These findings indicate that prostaglandin D2 is produced by the brain-type synthetase in the indicated types of cochlear cells.\r"

Microtubules assembled in vitro in taxol were pelleted by centrifugation. The volumes of the resulting pellets were calculated from their weights assuming a specific gravity of 1 and then were normalized to the amount of protein in the pellet, yielding a value for pellet specific volume in microliter/mg of protein. The specific volume of the pellets reflects the intermicrotubule spacing within the pellet. Microtubules were assembled from tubulin alone or tubulin plus various amounts of MAP-2 or tau and collected by centrifugation, and the pellet specific volume was measured. The specific volume of microtubules composed of pure tubulin ranged from 6.4 to 7.7 microliter/mg of protein. Tau had no detectable effect on this value even at saturating levels on the microtubules. In contrast, MAP-2 increased pellet specific volume as the MAP-2/tubulin weight ratio increased; at the highest ratio examined, 0.43, the pellet specific volume was approximately 33. Even at the relatively low MAP-2/tubulin ratio of 0.09, pellet specific volume was approximately 2-fold greater than that of microtubules containing tubulin alone or tubulin plus tau. Electron microscopy confirmed that the observations on pellet specific volume reflected differences in the effects of MAP-2 and tau on the packing density of sedimented microtubules. These results are discussed in the context of observations showing that neighboring microtubules are more widely spaced in dendrites than in axons and that MAP-2 is enriched on microtubules in dendrites compared to microtubules in axons, whereas the converse is true for tau.\r"

Oligonucleotides with EDTA.Fe at the 5' end cause a sequence specific double strand break. The location and asymmetry of the cleavage pattern reveal that the homopyrimidine-EDTA probes bind in the major groove parallel to the homopurine strand of Watson-Crick double helical DNA. The sequence-specific recognition of double helical DNA by homopyrimidine probes is sensitive to single base mismatches. Homopyrimidine probes equipped with DNA cleaving moieties could be useful tools for mapping chromosomes.\r"

The deduced amino acid sequence is most similar to the recently cloned human beta 2- and beta 1-adrenergic receptors; however, similarities to the muscarinic cholinergic receptors are also evident. Two related genes have been identified by low stringency Southern blot analysis. These genes may represent additional alpha 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes.\r"

The muscarinic agonist carbachol both inhibited adenylyl cyclase and stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis was significantly less efficient and more dependent on receptor levels than the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Both responses were mediated by guanine nucleotide binding proteins, as evidenced by their inhibition by pertussis toxin; the more efficiently coupled adenylyl cyclase response was significantly more sensitive. Thus, individual subtypes of a given receptor are capable of regulating multiple effector pathways.\r"

In this preparation, C-ANF4-23 is devoid of detectable renal effects and does not antagonize any of the known renal hemodynamic and natriuretic actions of biologically active ANF1-28. In contrast, both C-ANF4-23 and ANF1-28 increase sodium excretion and decrease blood pressure in intact anesthetized rats. This apparent contradiction is resolved by the finding that the ring-deleted analog markedly increases plasma levels of endogenous immunoreactive ANF in the rat. The results show that the majority of the renal receptors of ANF are biologically silent. This new class of receptors may serve as specific peripheral storage-clearance binding sites, acting as a hormonal buffer system to modulate plasma levels of ANF.\r"

Nevertheless, it is well known that the adult repertoire of antibody specificities is acquired in a developmentally programmed fashion. As previously shown, rearrangement of the gene segments encoding the heavy-chain variable regions (VH) of mouse antibodies is also developmentally ordered: the number of VH gene segments rearranged in B lymphocytes of fetal mice is small but increased progressively after birth. In this report, human fetal B-lineage cells were also shown to rearrange a highly restricted set of VH gene segments. In a sample of heavy-chain transcripts from a 130-day human fetus the most frequently expressed human VH element proved to be closely related to the VH element most frequently expressed in murine fetal B-lineage cells. These observations are important in understanding the development of immunocompetence.\r"

Sludge of the gallbladder was demonstrated in five of the 12 patients after a minimum period of nine days after the operation, and in four of these, microlithiasis of the biliary tract was subsequently revealed. In two of these four patients, the stones dissolved spontaneously, while in the remaining two patients, no change occurred in dimension after intervals of six and seven months, respectively. In all instances, sludge and microcalculi were completely \"silent.\" This study was done to underline the high incidence of biliary tract sludge and microlithiasis in the patients examined and to indicate the necessity for preventive measures against the possible and serious complications of this disease as well as acute pancreatitis.\r"

Twenty-five patients had tumors of the proximal portion of the biliary tract, 19 had sclerosing cholangitis and the remaining 11 had benign strictures of the biliary tract. Ring catheters were placed into both the right and left hepatic ducts in 38 of the 55 patients. In the remaining 17 patients, a single Ring catheter was advanced beyond the stricture and into the duodenum in 50 of the 55 patients. The preoperative percutaneous placement of Ring catheters into the right and left hepatic ducts has proved to be a useful technical aide in the operative management of patients with lesions of the proximal part of the biliary tract. Having these catheters in place at the time of the operation helps significantly in dissecting the extrahepatic biliary tree and bifurcation and are subsequently used to place the transhepatic Silastic stents that are used in the reconstruction of the biliary tract.\r"

All of the patients presented with bright red rectal bleeding. Bleeding scans demonstrated a source of blood loss high in the small intestine in two patients who had jejunal diverticula at exploratory laparotomy. In another patient, the results of preoperative evaluation did not reveal the site of hemorrhage. Jejunal diverticula were found at exploratory laparotomy. These three patients underwent jejunal resection and have since remained free of gastrointestinal bleeding. In the fourth patient, mesenteric arteriography revealed extravasation from a jejunal diverticulum. After angiography, the patient experienced no further hemorrhage, and surgical treatment was not performed. This patient remained asymptomatic and died of myocardial infarction five years later. The successful nonoperative management of this patient belies the high reported incidence of recurrent hemorrhage associated with jejunal diverticula. Thus, patients with rectal bleeding who are found to have jejunal diverticula should undergo removal of the involved jejunum, even if preoperative evaluation results implicate another source. The results of this study suggest that jejunal diverticula are a more frequent cause of extensive rectal bleeding than heretofore appreciated, particularly in the elderly.\r"

Of those with local recurrence, distant metastases developed in 68 per cent compared with 37 per cent of those with no local disease (p = 0.025). Survival was similarly affected with 86 per cent of those with locally controlled tumor who were alive at five years (not significantly different from the more well-differentiated tumors) versus a 56 per cent actuarial survival in those with locally recurrent disease (p less than 0.05).\r"

The animals were randomly divided into a control group and four treatment groups as follows: cisplatin, 6.0 mg/kg; cisplatin, 2.0 mg/kg, vinblastine, and methotrexate; cisplatin, 2.0 mg/kg, vinblastine, methotrexate, and doxorubicin hydrochloride; and cisplatin, 2.0 mg/kg, vinblastine, methotrexate, and mitomycin C. The drugs were given intraperitoneally on days 7, 14, and 21. The study was repeated using MBT-683. Drug effect on tumor diameter and survival were compared. Cisplatin alone was as effective in MBT-2 and more effective in MBT-683 in reducing tumor volume and increasing survival than the various combinations. The higher tolerable dose of cisplatin used as a single agent probably accounts for these results and suggests that cisplatin is the most effective agent in these combination therapy regimens.\r"

All nine cases had one or more CT features that were characteristic or suggestive of MEP. These included periosteal pattern of hyperostosis, inward bulging of the vault lesion, surface irregularity of the hyperostotic bone, and intracranial changes. The role of CT in evaluating MEP is compared with other neuroradiologic techniques. The results indicate that high-resolution CT is the neuroimaging method of choice in evaluating MEP.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant peripheral nerve-sheath neoplasms frequently complicate neurofibromatosis causing pain, enlarging masses, or neurologic deficits. However, similar findings sometimes also occur with benign nerve neoplasms. Our study was done retrospectively to determine if imaging techniques can differentiate malignant from benign nerve tumors in neurofibromatosis. Eight patients with symptomatic neoplasms (three benign, five malignant) were studied by CT in eight, MR in six, and 67Ga-citrate scintigraphy in seven. Uptake of 67Ga occurred in all five malignant lesions but not in two benign neoplasms studied. On CT or MR, all eight lesions, including three benign neoplasms, showed inhomogeneities. Of five lesions with irregular, infiltrative margins on CT or MR, four were malignant and one was benign. Of three lesions with smooth margins, one was malignant and two were benign. One malignant neoplasm caused irregular bone destruction. Accordingly, CT and MR could not generally distinguish malignant from benign lesions with certainty. However, both CT and MR provided structural delineation to help surgical planning for both types of lesion. 67Ga scintigraphy appears promising as a screening technique to identify lesions with malignant degeneration in patients with neurofibromatosis. Any area of abnormal radiogallium uptake suggests malignancy warranting further evaluation by CT or MR. Biopsy of any questionable lesion is essential.\r"

Existing evidence supports the concept that reperfusion rates are somewhat higher with TPA, particularly after 4 hours when streptokinase is relatively ineffective but the degree of myocardial salvage is likely to be small. Streptokinase has the major advantage of a proven track record, both in terms of improved survival and a low incidence of complications. TPA has the theoretical advantages of less activation of the systemic thrombolytic system and a shorter half-life, but the clinical relevance of these factors has not been shown and may be difficult to prove. Also, whereas a reasonable treatment protocol has been established by consensus for streptokinase, the optimal dosage and infusion time for TPA have not been defined and may be subject to individual variation. Finally, the cost of TPA is substantially higher than for streptokinase. In light of these considerations, the FDA advisory panel's recommendation to withhold approval of TPA becomes easier to understand. Clearly, additional evidence verifying the safety and efficacy of TPA is needed. If and when TPA is released, the clinician will be faced with a choice of thrombolytic agents. Assuming equal safety and efficacy, streptokinase may remain the drug of choice for most patients because of its lower cost. Finally, it is likely that the next few years will see additional refinements in TPA that may further enhance efficacy while decreasing the incidence of complications, and that a competitive market for TPA will reduce the cost. Reports of these developments are anxiously awaited.\r"

Early technetium-99m pyrophosphate imaging was performed by emission computed tomography to evaluate reperfusion and to test the feasibility of estimating infarct size soon after coronary reperfusion based on acute positive tomographic findings. Twenty-seven patients with transmural AMI who were treated with intracoronary urokinase infusion followed by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty underwent pyrophosphate imaging 8.7 +/- 2.1 hours after the onset of AMI. None of the 8 patients in whom reperfusion was unsuccessful had acute positive findings. Of 19 patients in whom reperfusion was successful, 17 had acute positive findings (p less than 0.001). In these 17, tomographic infarct volumes were determined from reconstructed transaxial images. The threshold for areas of increased pyrophosphate uptake within the infarct was set at 60% of peak activity by the computerized edge-detection algorithm. The total number of pixels in all transaxial sections showing increased tracer uptake were added and multiplied by a size factor and 1.05 g/cm3 muscle to determine infarct volume. The correlations of tomographic infarct volumes with peak serum creatine kinase (CK) levels (r = 0.82) and with cumulative release of CK-MB isoenzyme (r = 0.89) were good. Moreover, the time to positive imaging was significantly shorter than that to peak CK level (8.5 +/- 2.3 vs 10.4 +/- 2.2 hours, p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, metastases of several types of NE tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma, gastrinoma, insulinoma, small (oat) cell carcinoma of the lung, gastrointestinal carcinoid, and neuroblastoma, were examined for the presence of synaptophysin by immunocytochemistry, with the use of tissue sections as well as centrifuged cell suspensions and by immunoblotting of tumor proteins. The results show that expression of synaptophysin can be maintained during formation of metastases. Therefore, the authors propose that synaptophysin antibodies be used for the positive identification of metastatic NE tumors, notably in differential diagnosis. The possible implications of these findings for tumor diagnosis are discussed.\r"

Current reports continue to regard unfixed frozen sections as the material of choice for immunoperoxidase studies of lymphoproliferative diseases. In this study, periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) is shown to be a valuable fixative for the improved detection of surface antigens in lymphoid tissue. In cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease, more frequent detection of diagnostic markers and ease of interpretation was demonstrated by use of PLP-fixed frozen tissue as compared with unfixed frozen tissue. Immunoglobulin staining was more easily interpreted in 30% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In Hodgkin's disease, Ki-1 antigen, a diagnostic marker of Reed-Sternberg cells, was found in PLP-fixed tissue from two cases in which this antigen was not detected in corresponding unfixed frozen tissue. The authors have demonstrated that PLP-fixed tissue can be sent to a central reference laboratory at ambient or room temperature, avoiding the expense and inconvenience of transporting specimens on dry ice. The authors conclude that PLP fixation is the preferred method for immunopathologic study of human lymphomas.\r"

Eighty controls along with 100 patients with Crohn's disease, 46 patients with ulcerative colitis, 20 patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy, and 18 patients with other diseases were studied. In controls, the median 24-h excretion was 1.34%/24 h of the oral dose. Patients with Crohn's disease (median 2.96%/24 h), ulcerative colitis (median 2.12%/24 h), and untreated gluten-sensitive enteropathy (median 3.56%/24 h) had significantly elevated urinary excretion of the probe compared to controls (p less than 0.0001). Increased 24-h urinary excretion of 51Cr-EDTA had a high association with intestinal inflammation (p less than 0.0001). Test specificity and sensitivity were 96% and 57%, respectively. A positive test has a 96% probability of correctly diagnosing the presence of intestinal inflammation, whereas a negative test has a 50% probability of predicting the absence of disease.\r"

The hypophosphatemia could not be attributed to differences in the etiology of renal failure, frequency of dialysis, or residual renal function. No hypophosphatemic patient received phosphate-binding antacids. The hypophosphatemia was related to carbohydrate (CHO) providing a large percentage (greater than 79%) of total calories for a prolonged period. This complication was likely caused by tissue anabolism as well as by CHO-stimulated, insulin-induced intracellular shifts of phosphate. The greater use of parenteral fat as a caloric source and more aggressive phosphate supplementation despite the presence of ARF may help prevent this complication.\r"

Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration was increased in patients with hyperthyroidism (48.0 +/- 19.5 pg/ml) but was decreased in patients with severe hypothyroidism (16.3 +/- 5.7 pg/ml) compared with values in normal control subjects (31.2 +/- 9.5 pg/ml). There was no significant difference between values in normal control subjects and mildly hypothyroid patients (35.0 +/- 12.2 pg/ml). The plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration was correlated with the serum thyroxine level and heart rate. The elevated atrial natriuretic peptide concentration in hyperthyroidism decreased, whereas the reduced atrial natriuretic peptide concentration in severe hypothyroidism increased, compared with the initial value after successful therapy. These results suggest that plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration is frequently increased in hyperthyroidism and is frequently decreased in severe hypothyroidism, and that thyroid hormone is one of the regulatory factors for circulating atrial natriuretic peptides.\r"

The remaining 10 to 15 percent of children with this disorder have the chronic (autoimmune) type of ITP. For these patients, splenectomy is often the recommended treatment if severe bleeding occurs and platelet counts remain below 40,000/mm3. However, splenectomy has associated risks and the response to this surgery cannot always be predicted. Intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) has proven useful as an alternative to splenectomy, especially in children who are considered too young for splenectomy or in those in whom there is no response to splenectomy. It should be noted that booster shots are frequently required and the patient's ITP may become refractory. IVIG may also be useful in preparing a child with ITP for splenectomy and in treating children or adolescents with ITP who have central nervous system or other serious hemorrhages. Although IVIG is not always effective in raising the platelet count, it does provide a very useful alternative method of treating this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The standard schedule for treating immune thrombocytopenia purpura in adults with intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion (IVIG), 400 mg/kg per day for five days, was compared with a shorter schedule using 1,000 mg/kg per day for two days. Both schedules were found to be effective in correcting thrombocytopenia. Eleven of the 17 patients treated with the five-day regimen and nine of 10 patients treated with the two-day regimen had significant responses. Patients with an initial platelet count of less than 20,000 platelets/mm3 or with an estimated in vivo platelet survival in excess of 90 hours were less likely to have a response than were other patients. There were no serious side effects in either group, but thrombophlebitis was observed in some patients receiving the five-day regimen when a single intravenous catheter was used for more than three days. Headaches and, less commonly, low-grade fever were noted in some patients receiving the two-day regimen when infusions were given at flow rates in excess of 0.04 ml/kg/minute. Since the two-day regimen requires shorter hospitalization and corrects thrombocytopenia slightly faster than the five-day course, it may be particularly useful in correcting thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients requiring splenectomy or other surgery.\r"

Six children younger than two years of age, who presented with severe infections and persistent absolute neutrophil counts (300/mm3), were treated with 1 g of gamma globulin per kilo body weight until counts reached more than 1,000/mm3. The average response occurred with a dose of 3.0 g/kg within five to seven days and lasted an average of 14 days before counts decreased to baseline levels. Four patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia were also treated with IVIG, 1 g/kg for five to seven days (average dose of 5 g/kg), for severe Coombs'-positive hemolytic anemia. Response of the hemolytic anemia to IVIG was excellent in one patient and good in two patients. No response occurred in the fourth patient. Response was slower in these patients than in patients treated for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The average total amount of gamma globulin required for a response is markedly different: 1 g/kg for ITP, 3.0 g/kg for autoimmune neutropenia, and 5 g/kg for hemolytic anemia. Possible mechanisms of action include blockade of reticuloendothelial system Fc receptors, suppression of autoantibody production, and/or interference in the binding of autoantibodies to target cells.\r"

Although this substance represented a major advance in the treatment of patients with agammaglobulinemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, it has a number of major limitations that restrict its clinical utility. These include the need for intramuscular administration, pain at the site of injection, loss of immunoglobulin G (IgG) extravascularly, limitations on the degree to which serum IgG can be increased, incomplete and delayed onset of absorption, and limitations on the volume of material administered. Intravenous forms of gamma globulin do not have these limitations and, therefore, have been preferred for therapeutic use. While studying the physical chemistry of IgG in solution, it was observed that lowering the pH to the range of 4.0 to 4.5 markedly enhanced its monomer content and stability, obviating the need for any chemical modification, enzymatic treatment, or lyophilization. A new IgG preparation suitable for intravenous administration, IGIV, pH 4.25, has been developed and subjected to extensive clinical testing. It is licensed in the United States (Gamimune N) for replacement therapy of IgG in immunodeficiency syndromes and for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The biochemistry and safety of IGIV, pH 4.25, are reviewed.\r"

The fatty acids secreted by normal skin play an important role in regulation of the cutaneous microbial ecosystem, and it can be questioned whether application of a solvent might paradoxically promote colonization by pathogenic microorganisms. The clinical value of defatting catheter insertion sites was prospectively studied in a controlled, randomized trial: 100 subclavian catheters inserted for total parenteral nutrition were given identical site care except that with one half of the catheters, the site was defatted with acetone prior to catheter insertion and as part of the every-other-day site care regimen. Cutaneous colonization was found in only 130 (24.5 percent) of 531 site cultures in both groups, but was strongly predictive of concordant colonization of the catheter (relative risk, 22.1, p less than 0.001) and catheter-related septicemia (all four cases). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in cutaneous colonization of sites (22.7 percent and 27.0 percent), in colonization of catheters on removal (four catheters [8 percent] in each group) or in catheter-related septicemia (two catheters [4 percent] in each group). However, pain or inflammation of the insertion site was twice as frequent in the acetone group (80 percent versus 35 percent, p less than 0.001). Defatting with acetone as part of the regimen for cutaneous disinfection does not improve microbial removal or reduce the incidence of catheter-related infection, but increases cutaneous inflammation and patient discomfort.\r"

After unsuccessful therapeutic trials with pharmacologic doses of vitamin D or its active metabolites, the patients were treated by long-term intracaval infusions of calcium through an implantable catheter. A total of 0.5 to 0.9 g of elemental calcium was infused daily for 18 months and the serum calcium concentration was maintained at 9 to 10 mg/dl. Bone pain subsided within one week of treatment. Serum phosphorus, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations and alkaline phosphatase activity were normalized within four to nine months. Radiographs of the knees and hands revealed progressive healing of rickets with complete resolution after one year of treatment. The patients gained 12 cm and 8 cm per year in height as compared with 3 cm and 2 cm, respectively, in the previous year. A transilial bone biopsy obtained from one patient prior to treatment revealed severe osteomalacia associated with osteitis fibrosa. A follow-up biopsy examined after 12 months of therapy showed almost complete healing of osteomalacia and normal mineralization. These observations indicate the following: (1) Long-term intracaval calcium infusions are an effective mode of therapy for these patients, and (2) When adequate serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations are maintained, healing of rickets and normal growth rate could be achieved even in the absence of a normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor-effector system.\r"

  ".W": "Postoperative endomyometritis is the most common complication associated with cesarean delivery. The frequency of endomyometritis varies from 5% to 85% (mean 35% to 40%), depending on the socioeconomic characteristics of the patient population and the indication for abdominal delivery. In women undergoing cesarean section after extended duration of labor and ruptured membranes, the use of prophylactic antibiotics has been consistently effective in decreasing the frequency of endomyometritis. A single dose of antibiotic administered after the umbilical cord is clamped provides a degree of prophylaxis comparable to that achieved with two- and three-dose regimens. There is no evidence that the newer extended-spectrum cephalosporins or penicillins are better for prophylaxis than ampicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin. Administration of antibiotics by intraoperative irrigation is an acceptable, but not superior, alternative to systemic antibiotic administration. Prophylactic antibiotics alter the vaginal flora after operation, but to date harmful clinical effects have not occurred as a result of such alteration.\r"

  ".W": "In Europe and North America, estrogen/progestogen oral contraception has been associated with an increase in venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke. These hazards are found mainly in smokers and in women over the age of 35. Venous thromboembolism appears to correlate with the estrogen dosage, and the arterial complications with both the estrogen and progestogen components. Blood coagulation and vascular thrombosis are intimately related. Estrogen/progestogen oral contraception affects blood clotting by increasing plasma fibrinogen and the activity of coagulation factors, especially factors VII and X; antithrombin III, the inhibitor of coagulation, is usually decreased. Platelet activity is also enhanced with acceleration of aggregation. These changes create a state of hypercoagulability that, to a large extent, appears to be counterbalanced by increased fibrinolytic activity. Studies of the oral contraceptives in current use show that the coagulation effects depend on the dosage of estrogen and the type of progestogen used in combination. Current research is aimed at finding the estrogen/progestogen formulations that induce the least changes in the coagulation system and other physiologic processes. In this respect, the new low-dose formulations are a major step forward and should reduce the risk of vascular thrombotic complications.\r"

The long-term unopposed administration of estrogen produces endometrial hyperplasia and amenorrhea, which are unacceptable to most women and their medical advisors. Cyclic administration of progestogens in combination with the estrogen, however, produces predictable endometrial shedding and achieves a regular and acceptable bleeding pattern in most women. This was the main reason that the \"delay of menses\" test was adopted as the earliest clinical means of comparing the relative potencies of progestogens that were administered orally. Recently attempts have been made to compare the potency of progestogens on the other organ systems by the extrapolation of data derived from studies on the endometrium. This is inappropriate, inasmuch as the effects of progestogens and estrogens independently and in combination differ greatly depending on the target organ. In this article, the literature on this controversial subject is reviewed.\r"

These early oral contraceptives were associated with high rates of side effects and complications. As a result, the hormone levels have been gradually reduced to attain the minimal amount necessary for contraception while most of the undesired side effects and complications have been eliminated. Recently, a new approach has been added. This mechanism consists of altering the dose of estrogen or progestogen or both during the month and is referred to as the phasic approach. The newest phasic pills now use a triphasic approach. Three basic formulations of the triphasic pill have been developed. In two of the three formulations, the progestogen level is altered, whereas the estrogen level remains stable; in the third formulation, both estrogen and progestogen are changed. Multiple clinical studies of the triphasics, such as ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, prove that there is a significant reduction in the incidence of side effects and complications related to oral contraception.\r"

Our studies with low-dose pills containing 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol/150 micrograms levonorgestrel or 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol/150 micrograms desogestrel compared with the new pills with 35 micrograms ethinyl estradiol/250 micrograms norgestimate or 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol/75 micrograms gestodene revealed no significant alterations of serum glucose after glucose loading. With all four combination pills, insulin levels were slightly elevated when compared with controls. Studies of the lipid metabolism showed that depending on the type and estrogen combination, progestogens have different effects on lipid metabolism. The new progestogens seem to have a more pronounced effect on triglycerides, whereas total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol remain almost unchanged. In general, it could be shown that low-dose oral contraceptives have little impact on lipid metabolism. Studies with low-dose monophasic preparations, including the new formulations, reveal only a low effect on blood coagulation. According to our and other data on the new progestogens in oral contraceptives available so far, it can be expected that such low-dose monophasic and triphasic combination pills will be beneficial during longtime use with respect to side effects on the cardiovascular system and control of the menstrual cycle.\r"

Four birth control vaccines directed against human chorionic gonadotropin are currently in early clinical trials. The nature of these vaccines and the underlying principles are described, as are the available results from clinical studies. The alpha- and beta-subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin and the ovine gonadotropins have been cloned by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid methods. A new breed of vaccines that combines the genes of gonadotropins linked to hepatitis B surface protein has been developed. The next generation of birth control vaccines is likely to be polyvalent and to have the ability to intercept fertility at more than one point. A number of monoclonal antibodies against human sperm have shown the presence of tissue-specific antigens and the possibility of preventing the fertilization of the egg. Inclusion of more than one carrier in the vaccine increases the percentage of high responders and accords immunoprophylactic benefits against more than one disease. Conjugates have also been developed to obtain high titers of antibodies against gonadotropin-releasing hormone with permissible adjuvants. This vaccine may have therapeutic applications in hormone-dependent cancers and precocious puberty.\r"

The most advanced type of subdermal contraceptive capsule contains about 36 to 40 mg of levonorgestrel and is 30 mm in length and 2.4 mm in diameter (Norplant). The set of six implants is placed under the skin of the upper arm with a 10-gauge trocar with the use of a local anesthetic. The basis for the antifertility effect of these implants is continuous, low-dose progestogen therapy without the use of estrogen. The capsules release a total of approximately 39 micrograms of levonorgestrel each day. The blood progestogen level achieved through this microabsorption delivery system is 0.25 to 0.3 ng/ml. There is a sufficient supply of steroid in the capsules to maintain this blood progestogen level for 5 to 6 years. Since the capsules can be removed at any time, this contraceptive method is voluntarily reversible. The effectiveness of these subdermal implants has been evaluated in long-term studies that have progressed for well over 5 years. Therefore one clinic visit eliminates nearly 2000 days of concern over having to remember to take a pill on schedule. There has been sufficient experience to assure that fertility recurs promptly after removal of the subdermal implants.\r"

The authors now report 3 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that were immunologically classified as having a T-cell phenotype and in which, in addition to rearrangements of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene, a rearrangement of an immunoglobulin light-chain gene was clearly identified by Southern blot hybridization. The results demonstrate that the data obtained by molecular hybridization should be interpreted with caution when the immunogenetic findings do not correlate with immunophenotypic expression, and that the results of molecular genetics studies should be interpreted in conjunction with morphologic and immunologic findings.\r"

Multivariant analysis identified correlations between increased mitochondrial size, decreased mitochondrial number, and severity of neurologic disease (stage). A disproportionate increase in mitochondrial area and perimeter in the RS cases with the most depressed mitochondrial number distinguished the 4 children with residual neurologic damage or death. Serum salicylate concentrations were negatively correlated with severity of morphologic alteration. Two cases of non-RS salicylate toxicity showed normal or near-normal mitochondrial size and number. In fatty liver from an autopsy specimen from a child, a child with carnitine deficiency, and a child on therapy for dermatomyositis, mitochondrial numbers were also normal. Decreased mitochondrial numbers are characteristic of RS and imply a pathophysiologic mechanism, possibly related to impaired mitochondrial replication. Synergism with other forms of mitochondrial injury, such as salicylates, hypoglycemia, or shock may influence clinical severity, progression, and outcome.\r"

The principal exogenous activators that are used clinically are streptokinase, urokinase, and tissue plasminogen activator. Acute arterial occlusions are more likely than chronic occlusions to respond to thrombolytic therapy, especially if treatment is instituted within a few hours of onset of symptoms and if the disease is due to embolic material rather than in situ thrombosis. Since the duration of drug infusion necessary to lyse arterial thrombus cannot be predicted, patients in whom tissue viability cannot be determined or in whom ischemia cannot be tolerated during the drug infusion interval are not candidates for intraarterial fibrinolytic drug infusion. In treating patients with venous occlusion, thrombolytic therapy is more effective against proximal clots than in calf thrombosis. No protective effect from pulmonary embolism has been noted in trials comparing heparin with streptokinase. Fifty percent of patients with an initial episode of deep venous thrombosis treated within 72 hours of onset will have complete resolution of thrombus with preservation of valve function.\r"

Regional cerebral blood volume was measured serially during the addition of 50% N2O to a background anesthetic of fentanyl in normocapnic (group 1) and hypocapnic (PaCO2 25 mmHg, group 2) dogs. In each group, after 15 min of N2O administration accompanied by rCBV measurement, elimination of N2O with 100% O2 was continued for 15 min. This was followed by introduction of 2% isoflurane (no N2O), again accompanied by serial measurements of rCBV. In the normocapnic animals, the addition of 50% N2O caused an 11% increase in rCBV (6.1 +/- 1.4 to 6.8 +/- 1.0 ml/100 g, P less than 0.02) while 2% isoflurane caused a 36% increase (6.1 +/- 1.3 to 8.0 +/- 1.7 ml/100 g, P less than 0.02). The initial induction of hypocapnia during infusion of fentanyl in group 2 animals was associated with a 17% decrease in rCBV. In the hypocapnic dogs, there was no change in rCBV when N2O was introduced; however, an increase of 15% occurred following the addition of isoflurane (3.9 +/- 0.6 to 4.5 +/- 0.7 ml/100 g, P less than 0.02). Isoflurane, even during hypocapnia, may increase cerebral blood volume which in some circumstances may lead to an increase in ICP.\r"

Alfentanil was administered as a 30-s infusion of either 50 or 120 micrograms.kg-1. Pharmacokinetic values were independent of dose. There was no correlation between Vdss (Volume of distribution at a steady state, measured as l.kg-1) and age or weight, and there was a weak correlation between clearance and age (r = 0.51, P less than 0.05). Vdss and elimination t1/2 were not different in infants less than 1 yr of age when compared to older children. The mean value of Vdss was 0.419 (SE .028) l.kg-1) for the whole group, and elimination t1/2 was 76.3 (SE 6.5) min. The clearance rate [TBC = 7.9 (SE 0.41) ml.kg-1.min-1] was within the range of values previously determined in adult studies. From these data, it would appear that, although there may be differences in the disposition kinetics between children aged 3 months to 14 yr and those measured in adults in some studies by other investigators, age-related differences within this group were not demonstrable.\r"

  ".W": "Frequently, patients with COPD with similar spirometric impairment have marked differences in dyspnea and exercise limitation. As the classic \"blue bloater\" with attenuated respiratory drive is described as being less dyspneic than his \"pink puffer\" counterpart, we wondered whether the variability in dyspnea and exercise tolerance in a group of patients with COPD with relatively similar degrees of air-flow obstruction might be partly explained by the variability in resting respiratory drives (unstimulated P0.1 and hypoxic and hypercapnic P0.1 responses). Therefore, we measured unstimulated mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1), hypoxic response (-delta P0.1/delta SaO2), hypercapnic response (delta P0.1/delta PCO2), 6-min walk distance, VO2max, steady-state exercise VE/VO2, exercise SaO2, and dyspnea using an oxygen cost diagram in 15 subjects with severe COPD (mean FEV1% 35.2 +/- 1.9 SEM). No correlations between spirometric impairment and either dyspnea or exercise performance were seen. Unstimulated P0.1 correlated inversely with spirometric impairment but did not correlate with dyspnea, VO2max or 6-min walk distance. Both hypoxic and hypercapnic responses were significantly correlated with greater exercise ventilation (VE/VO2), less exercise O2 desaturation, and a greater VO2max, but not with dyspnea or 6-min walk distance. The results of this study do not support the concept that depressed respiratory drives are associated with less dyspnea or greater exercise capability in COPD.\r"

Anticholinergic bronchodilators are of interest as alternatives to beta-adrenergic agents, particularly in patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema, yet little is known of the effects of either class of agent on gas exchange in patients with this diagnosis. We compared their effects on gas exchange in 12 patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema who also had arterial hypoxemia in a double-blind crossover study. We found that nebulized atropine methonitrate, a quaternary ammonium anticholinergic bronchodilator, resulted in only minor and statistically insignificant effects on gas exchange at all times for as long as 60 min after its inhalation. In contrast, the beta-adrenergic bronchodilator metaproterenol hydrochloride resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the PaO2, the greatest mean decrease being 5.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg (mean +/- 1 SD). The effects of metaproterenol on arterial blood gases in this population of patients were more prolonged than those previously reported in asthmatic subjects with lesser degrees of hypoxemia. An anticholinergic bronchodilator might be preferable in patients with hypoxemia caused by chronic bronchitis and emphysema in that it does not carry the risk of worsening systemic hypoxemia.\r"

We evaluated prospectively a combined treatment regimen using antacid, an H2-receptor antagonist, and enteral feeding in 60 patients who had serious burns (mean burn size, 36% body surface area) in this series. The incidence of both overt and occult complications was 3 per cent and in no patient did a perforation develop nor was operative intervention required. No patient died of the complications of Curling's ulcer. Combination therapy may be of value in other patients prone to stress ulceration.\r"

Thus, newer strategies of providing quality patient care need be developed to achieve this goal. The purpose of this study was to compare the costs and outcome of patients who had modified radical mastectomies, who were discharged home with an indwelling hemovac drain, and whose follow-up was conducted by visiting nurses in contrast to the traditional hospitalization of these patients until the hemovacs were removed. Two groups were compared in a prospective fashion. Twenty patients who had undergone a modified radical mastectomy for stage I or II breast carcinoma and who were discharged home with an indwelling hemovac drain (HWIH) were compared with 20 modified radical mastectomy patients who remained hospitalized with the drains for continuous wall suction (IHWH). Mean length of stay for the HWIH group (2.65 days) was significantly lower than the IHWH group (9.65 days) (P less than .001). Mean total hospital charges (exclusive of physician fees) were significantly lower for the HWIH group ($ 2106) than for the IHWH group ($ 7672) (P less than .001). Under Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) reimbursement allowances, the IHWH group had a loss of $ 355 per patient, whereas the HWIH group had a profit of $ 5211 per patient. One complication in the HWIH group required rehospitalization (a wound infection that was treated with IV antibiotics). This study suggests that significant improvement in efficiency may be accomplished for selected mastectomy patients who are discharged home with the indwelling hemovac drain to be followed as outpatients by both the surgeon and a nurse specialist.\r"

One hundred ninety-seven patients with breast cancer treated by modified radical mastectomy between the years 1978 and 1981 were studied. Fifty-nine (30%) of the total group had distant metastases during the course of observation of 60 to 96 months; of 35 patients in whom bone metastases developed, 30 had normal preoperative bone scan results. Of 21 patients who had liver metastases, 19 had normal preoperative liver scans. Nineteen (70%) of the 27 patients with abnormal bone scans had normal alkaline phosphatase levels. Seven (63%) of the 11 patients who had abnormal liver scans had a normal alkaline phosphatase. The study supports the concept that preoperative bone and liver scans are ineffective indicators of metastatic involvement. Selection of patients for screening by bone and liver scans according to alkaline phosphatase determinations was not supported by this study. The appropriate use of bone scans for screening in patients with breast carcinoma is suggested as a follow-up device in patients with positive lymph nodes.\r"

In an effort to explain this, we tested whether histamine could evoke changes in endogenous antitumor lymphokine production using tonsil lymphocytes as test cells. We have observed that lymphocytes, treated in vitro with histamine, display a significant suppression of lymphokine production and mixed lymphocyte proliferation response following galactose oxidase treatment. Interferon gamma production was reduced to less than 2% of control value in the presence of histamine. In contrast, the lymphokine-activated killer cell activity induced by purified, natural interleukin-2 was not affected by similar concentrations of histamine. Histamine appears to exert its inhibitory effect by stimulating the production of a substance released by suppressor T cells. The suppressive effects observed could be reversed by concomitant or sequential treatment with cimetidine or ranitidine and not by H1 histamine antagonists, indicating that it occurs through an H2 histamine receptor. These experiments suggest that histamine may have a profound suppressive effect on the lymphocyte population studied.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperosmotic blood-brain barrier disruption transiently increases the rate of blood-to-tissue transport of water-soluble compounds to normal brain and has been used in brain tumor patients to increase the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs. This method remains controversial; debate concerns the extent to which it increases drug delivery to brain tumors. Ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-induced gliomas in rats have the lowest rate of blood-to-tissue transfer of the water-soluble compound alpha-aminoisobutyric acid of all experimental brain tumors studied to date. To gain further understanding about the effects of hyperosmotic blood-brain barrier disruption in brain tumors, we measured the unidirectional blood-to-tissue transfer constant of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid in ENU-induced brain tumors in rats after hyperosmotic disruption. Hyperosmotic blood-brain barrier disruption with 1.6 osmolar mannitol resulted in an averaged whole-tumor transfer constant of 0.013 +/- 0.003 (standard error) mL/(g/min), compared to a transfer constant of 0.007 +/- 0.002 mL/(g/min) for ENU-induced gliomas in the contralateral undisrupted hemisphere, a difference that was not significant. In contrast, hyperosmotic blood-brain barrier disruption produced a large and significant increase in the transfer constant of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid in tumor-free cortex (from 0.002 +/- 0.001 to 0.05 +/- 0.011 mL/[g/min]) and in tumor-free corpus callosum (from 0.001 +/- 0.003 to 0.017 +/- 0.005 mL/[g/min]). Hyperosmotic blood-brain barrier disruption does not appear to be an efficient method with which to increase the rate of delivery of water-soluble drugs to brain tumors but does result in a significant increase in the delivery rate of these drugs to normal brain tissue.\r"

This scale includes assessment of swallowing, speech, and respiratory function, and both strength and function of upper and lower extremity musculature. The evaluation is relatively simple to perform and yields reproducible data for both a total ALS score and a score for each group of functions tested. A score of 30 points is normal; 164 points indicates maximal dysfunction. The total ALS score increased in a linear fashion in each of 74 patients followed for at least one year. Among patients, the rate of disease progression varied twenty-fold, with a continuous distribution from the slowest to most rapid course. Thirty-four percent of patients exhibited a rapid change of greater than 48 points in the year, predicting progression to a terminal stage in less than two years; 19% of patients exhibited a slow change of less than 13 points in one year, predicting progression to a terminal stage over at least five years. This ALS scoring system should permit more accurate assessment of drug efficacy in clinical trials and correlation of rates of progression with clinical variables.\r"

Washing after up to 40 to 45 min of exposure to enoxacin followed by suspension in drug-free medium prevented a significant effect of enoxacin on cell growth. Cell uptakes obtained with different methods showed no difference in the shape of the timed uptake curves but did show significant quantitative differences. These results are consistent with cell-associated enoxacin comprising a freely exchangeable pool of drug. Lineweaver-Burk plots of uptake were consistent with uptake of enoxacin by simple diffusion. No saturability and no competition with ciprofloxacin were observed. Low temperature (4 degrees C) was associated with decreased uptake. Arsenate, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, sodium fluoride, sodium azide, and 2,4-dinitrophenol had no effect on uptake. We conclude that the mechanism of transport of enoxacin into cells is by simple diffusion. Mutants of E. coli with deficiency of outer membrane proteins F and C and an enoxacin-resistant mutant selected by serial passage with increasing enoxacin concentrations demonstrated that F porins play a significant role in enoxacin uptake and influence susceptibility to enoxacin. Uptake was shown to be similar in a strain of Bacillus subtilis.\r"

Cmr and Emr determinants were localized by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, in which the Cmr gene of plasmid pIP501, of group B Streptococcus origin, and the Emr gene of transposon Tn917, of E. faecalis origin, served as probes. A chromosomal location was found for the nonconjugative Cmr and Emr markers of one wild-type strain. In two strains these markers were carried by nonconjugative plasmids, and in the other strains they were carried by plasmids that transferred by conjugation. Plasmids isolated from three transconjugants resistant to tetracycline but susceptible to minocycline bore nucleotide sequences homologous to the tetL gene. Nucleotide sequences homologous to conjugative transposon Tn916, of E. faecalis origin, were detected by hybridization in the tetracycline-minocycline-resistant transconjugants. Three of these transconjugants were plasmid free, while four harbored conjugative cryptic plasmids. Sequences homologous to Tn916 were also found on two conjugative plasmids, one of which appeared to be a conjugative cryptic plasmid that had acquired chromosomal Tcr Mnr markers during transfer.\r"

Used singly, all of the purine analogs were able to suppress an acute T. brucei subsp. brucei infection. 9-DINO and formycin B were the most active. None of the purine analogs was curative when used singly against a strain causing chronic central nervous system infection. 9-DINO was highly effective when used in combination with DFMO in curing this central nervous system infection and another more stringent experimental infection. Neither sinefungin nor formycin B was active in combination with DFMO in curing the central nervous system experimental infection. 9-DINO was metabolized to phosphorylated derivatives of 9-deazaadenosine and 9-deazaguanosine by bloodstream trypomastigotes, but not by murine erythrocyte suspensions or kidney or liver homogenates--a potential rationale for the selectivity of the analog. These studies indicate that 9-DINO is a potent, nontoxic purine analog which, in combination with DFMO, is capable of late-stage cures of African trypanosomiasis.\r"

Methods also have been developed to determine the skin irritation potential of a drug substance during the preclinical stages of transdermal dosage form development. Clinical studies are performed to test for skin irritation, contact sensitization, plasma levels of drug, and efficacy of the dosage form. In theory, these studies should be predictive of a dosage form's performance in routine clinical use. This may not be the case, however; contact sensitization cannot be predicted with absolute certainty beforehand in animals. This article discusses various aspects of testing transdermal dosage forms and how the results of these tests correlate with what happens when a transdermal dosage form is put into routine clinical use.\r"

Changes in oxygenation (measured by pulse oximeter and transcutaneous PO2 electrodes) and carbon dioxide (measured by transcutaneous PCO2 electrode) were recorded at the same time. Neither nebulised saline nor salbutamol caused any changes in the measurements of airway function. A significant drop in mean oxygen saturation of 2% and of transcutaneous oxygen tension of 1.3 kPa occurred after nebulised salbutamol. No significant change occurred in measurements of transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension, nor was there any significant change in any of these measurements after 2.5 ml of nebulised saline had been given as a control. These results suggest that nebulised salbutamol may cause significant hypoxaemia, in wheezy infants probably by inducing ventilation/perfusion disturbance.\r"

Patients colonised with both S aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had significantly higher titres against teichoic acid than those carrying S aureus alone. Titres were significantly higher when there were clinical signs of low grade infection in the patients chronically colonised with S aureus alone, and in those with both S aureus and P aeruginosa. Significant reduction in titres occurred after antimicrobial treatment given either orally or intravenously in patients with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rates and white cell counts. Measurement of staphylococcal antibody titres may be valuable in monitoring pulmonary infection and antimicrobial treatment in patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

The control group (N = 9) received TPN only and one group of patients (N = 6) received TPN supplemented with ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate (0.35 g/kg bw/day). Protein synthesis in skeletal muscle was assessed from the total ribosome concentration and the percentage of polyribosomes. In the control group the total concentration of ribosomes decreased after surgery by 23% (p less than 0.05) and the percentage of polyribosomes decreased by 21% (p less than 0.01), whereas in the ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate group both variables remained unaffected. The cumulative urinary urea excretion was significantly larger in the control group than in the ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate group (p less than 0.05). The calculated nitrogen balance was negative in the control group on each day of the study (p less than 0.05), but that of the ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate group was not statistically different from zero. The results show that postoperative maintenance of muscle protein synthesis and a more effective nitrogen use was achieved by supplementing TPN with ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate, 0.35 g/kg bw/day.\r"

  ".W": "Data generated from an earlier study have suggested a model in which greater numbers of long, vertical, associative axons may occur in the anterior cingulate cortex of schizophrenic patients relative to control subjects. This hypothesis has now been tested using neuron-specific antibodies raised against the 200-kilodalton neurofilament subunit, a component of neuronal cytoskeleton, to immunostain axons of human postmortem cingulate cortex. A manual method for counting axons in the region of layer II and sublamina IIIA has been designed and applied blindly to parallel control and schizophrenic immunoprocessed specimens. The results show that there are 25% more vertical axons in the schizophrenic than in the control specimens. Preferentially higher numbers of both long vertical axons (62%) and axons associated with blood vessels (52%) have also been noted in the schizophrenic specimens. By contrast, the number of large-caliber horizontal axons was the same in the two groups; therefore, the greater number of vertical axons in schizophrenic specimens does not appear to represent a nonspecific effect. When these data are corrected for the effects of several confounding variables using analysis of covariance, the overall pattern of the results persists. These findings suggest the possibility that there might be an increase of associative inputs into the anterior cingulate cortex of schizophrenic patients, although it is not clear at present whether the differences noted, if replicative, may be primarily or perhaps only secondarily related to the disorder.\r"

High concentrations of immunoreactive prostaglandin E2 and immunoreactive leukotriene B4 were found to be present in the synovial fluid in the early lesion. These levels rapidly declined, as did the ability of the infiltrating cells of the arthritic joint fluids to synthesize leukotriene B4. Articular cartilage and synovial lining were maintained for 24 hours in nonproliferative organ culture, and the synthesis of eicosanoids was measured by assay of the culture fluids. The synovial lining was the major source of eicosanoids. Synthesis of prostaglandin E2, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and leukotriene B4 by the arthritic synovial lining was low during the first few days, but reached maximal values between day 5 and day 15 of disease duration. Maximal eicosanoid production occurred around the time that damage to articular cartilage and bone has been reported to occur, though it is not certain that these two events are linked. It was demonstrated that, in chronic lesions, the arthritic synovial lining was still producing elevated levels of eicosanoids compared with levels in the control tissue.\r"

We compared arterial PO2, PCO2 and cardiac output during periods of adequate intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) and periods of HFJV. Reducing gas flow by decreasing the number of activated valves and increasing the frequency to greater than 4 Hz resulted in less than optimal arterial PO2 and PCO2 compared with IPPV. This indicates that convection during HFJV is probably essential for efficient gas exchange. Inspiration time proved to be important in determining efficacy of ventilation for a fixed ventilator minute volume. Cardiac output during all HFJV settings was equal to or greater than cardiac output during IPPV, even as those HFJV settings that resulted in a positive end-expiratory pressure.\r"

Plasma alfentanil concentrations and percentage binding to plasma proteins were measured in both maternal and neonatal blood.

Anti-Ro/SS-A antibody levels were found to vary considerably over time in a given patient when measured by both assays. Several patients who did not have detectable levels of this antibody at the time of their initial examination were found to be antibody positive at follow-up examinations. However, no significant relationship was found between antibody levels in either assay and SCLE skin disease activity. While not ruling out a pathogenetic role for this antibody in the elicitation of SCLE skin lesions, these results would suggest that other factors are likely to be involved.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies demonstrate that platelets from patients with platelet-type von Willebrand disease show specific and saturable binding of asialo von Willebrand factor (AS-vWF) under conditions where such binding is not observed with normal platelets. Although specific binding of 125I-AS-vWF to formalin-fixed normal platelets could not be demonstrated, specific binding to fixed patient platelets was seen with an apparent Kd of 1.3 micrograms/mL and specific maximally bound ligand of 0.40 micrograms/10(8) platelets. Preincubation of patient platelets with the antiglycoprotein Ib (anti-GPIb) monoclonal antibody AS-2 reduced total binding close to the level of computer-estimated nonspecific binding. In contrast, binding was not reduced by preincubation with anti-GPIIb/IIIa monoclonal antibody or with 5 mmol/L EDTA. Under stirring conditions, the binding of AS-vWF to fixed patient platelets was accompanied by a strong agglutination response. AS-vWF-induced agglutination was similarly observed in patient but not normal platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the presence of 5 mmol/L EDTA. In the absence of EDTA, AS-vWF produced a full aggregation response in patient PRP at concentrations as low as 0.1 microgram/mL in contrast to the 2 to 20 micrograms/mL required by normal PRP. Both thromboxane B2 formation and adenosine triphosphate secretion showed an AS-vWF concentration dependence paralleling the aggregation responses. These studies show that a major difference in the platelets from patients with platelet-type von Willebrand disease is the presence of an exposed, high-affinity binding site associated with GPIb that recognizes AS-vWF.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the membrane marker profile of human basophils a panel of well-established monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs, n = 60) was used for a combined toluidine/immunofluorescence staining procedure. Myeloid-associated MoAbs (particularly MoAbs against the LFA-1 family (CD11, CDw18), MoAbs directed against lactosylceramide (CDw17), anti-glycoprotein (gp) 150 MoAbs MCS 2 and MY 7 (CDw13), anti-gp 67 MoAb MY 9, anti Fc gamma-receptor (mol wt 40 kd) MoAb CIKM5, anti-CR 1 MoAb E 11, and the antiglycolipid MoAb VIM-2) were reactive with basophils, indicating a close relationship to other mature myeloid cells. Under normal conditions, basophils surprisingly express at least three activation-linked structures not detectable on mature neutrophils, ie, the p45 structure defined by MoAbs OKT-10 and VIP-2b, the p24 structure identified by the CD9 MoAb BA-2, and the receptor for interleukin 2 (IL 2) recognized by three different MoAbs (anti-TAC, IL2RI, anti-IL 2). Moreover, under short-term culture conditions basophils both in mononuclear cell (MNC) suspension and as purified fractions display the HLA-DR and T4 antigens. The neutrophilic/eosinophilic structure 3-fucosyl-N-acetyllactosamine is expressed on basophils only after neuraminidase treatment. Basophils were not stained at all by CD 16 MoAbs directed against the Fc gamma-receptor (mol wt 50 to 70 kd) of neutrophils, by the MoAb 63D3 (CDw12) recognizing the monocyte/granulocyte-associated p 200 antigen, and by the CDw 14 antibodies (VIM-13, Mo 2) defining the monocyte-specific structure p 55. Enriched basophils freshly obtained from chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) patients yielded identical results in FACS analyses. In summary, these data indicate that basophils generate a unique combination of surface determinants and possibly represent an activated cell population.\r"

  ".W": "During the early period following bone marrow transplantation before the immune system has reached full functional maturity, unprimed, nonspecific lytic systems may play a critical role as antiviral or antitumor effectors. The reconstitution of cells with this potential is of particular importance in recipients of bone marrow that has been depleted of mature T lymphocytes to prevent graft v host disease (GVHD). We examined the recovery of natural killer (NK) cells and interleukin 2 (IL 2)-augmented lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK) in 48 patients at various intervals following transplantation of bone marrow depleted of mature cellular elements by treatment with soybean agglutinin and sheep RBCs (SBA-E- BMT). We found normal levels of both NK and LAK activity as early as 3 weeks following SBA-E- BMT. When compared with cells from controls, NK and LAK precursors from transplant recipients appeared to be activated in vivo in that freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients had an elevated cytolytic activity toward NK-insensitive targets and a more rapid response to activation by IL 2. In patients as well as controls, both LAK precursors and LAK effectors lacked antigens present on mature T lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, or CD8) but expressed antigens present on NK cells (CD2, CD16, and NKH1A). The LAK cells did not lyse either donor or host peripheral blood T cell targets. The activity of NK effectors but not LAK precursors survived the in vivo total body irradiation used for pretransplant conditioning in three patients studied. LAK precursors could be demonstrated as early as 18 days following transplant at a time when the bone marrow contained primarily donor-derived cells. Little or no LAK activity could be generated from cells of the SBA-E- BM graft itself, suggesting that LAK precursors differentiate rapidly from more primitive progenitors in the marrow graft. Thus, our data indicate that the NK and LAK lytic systems are among the earliest activities to recover during immune reconstitution following T cell-depleted BMTs.\r"

  ".W": "The phospholipid inflammatory mediator, platelet-activating factor (PAF), can stimulate polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemotaxis. Conversion of cytoplasmic actin from monomers to filaments is associated with PMN motile functions. Using the fluorescent actin filament stain nitrobenzodiaxole phallicidin, we have investigated PAF's effects on human PMN actin polymerization. Concentrations of PAF between 1 x 10(-11) to 1 x 10(-6) mol/L induced actin filament (F-actin) assembly. An optimal concentration of PAF (1-5 x 10(-8) mol/L) induced a significantly lower rise in relative F-actin content (1.72 +/- 0.07 SEM) than an optimal concentration (5 x 10(-7) mol/L) of the chemotactic peptide FMLP (2.21 +/- 0.06). Unlike FMLP (F-actin content: 1.25 +/- 0.04 at five seconds), PAF stimulation was associated with a delay of more than five seconds (1.04 +/- 0.01 at five seconds) before an increase in F-actin could be detected. F-actin concentration reached maximum levels by 30 to 60 seconds. Prolonged stimulation (20 minutes) with PAF was associated with two phases of polymerization and depolymerization. Like FMLP, the initiation of actin filament assembly by PAF required receptor occupancy, this reaction being totally blocked by the PAF receptor inhibitor, SKI 63-441. As evidenced by the lack of inhibition by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (5 to 20 mumol/L), the production of leukotriene B4 was not required for the PAF-induced changes in F-actin. Like FMLP, PAF's ability to stimulate PMN actin polymerization was inhibited by pertussis toxin (.05 to 2.5 micrograms/mL) but not impaired by the addition of EGTA and/or the calcium ionophore A23187. Preincubation with 1 x 10(-11) to 1 x 10(-8) mol/L PAF for 2 to 60 minutes enhanced the rise in F-actin content induced by low concentrations of FMLP (5 x 10(-12) to 1 x 10(-10) mol/L) indicating that this phospholipid was capable of \"priming\" the PMN actin polymerization response.\r"

All 15 patients with T cell ALL showed rearrangements of both T beta and T gamma genes. Twenty-four of 53 non-T, non-B ALL patients (45%) showed T gamma gene rearrangements and only 14 of these also showed T beta gene rearrangements. Only a single patient rearranged the T beta gene in the absence of T gamma gene rearrangement. The rearrangement patterns of the T gamma gene in non-T, non-B ALL were quite different from those observed in T cell ALL, as 20 of 23 patients retained at least one germline band of the T gamma gene. In contrast, all T cell ALL patients showed no retention of germline bands. These data indicate that rearrangement of the T gamma gene is not specific for T cell ALL. Further, the results also suggest that T gamma gene rearrangement precedes T beta gene rearrangement. The combined analysis of rearrangement patterns of IgH, T beta, and T gamma genes provides new criteria for defining the cellular origin of leukemic cells and for further delineation of leukemia cell heterogeneity.\r"

The incidence of awards of disability pensions because of rheumatoid arthritis during 1969-81, the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis on 31 December 1981, and the prevalence of subjects receiving free medicines for rheumatoid arthritis at the end of 1981 were significantly higher among the granite workers than in the general male population of the same age. Retrospective analysis of the records of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the cohort showed a predominance of a severe, serologically positive and erosive form of rheumatoid arthritis, usually with an age at onset of 50 or over. The possible aetiological or pathophysiological role of granite dust in rheumatoid arthritis may be based on the effects of quartz on the immune system.\r"

Renal biopsies were performed, and creatinine clearance and proteinuria were measured serially for 60 months (range 16-130 months). Ten patients developed proteinuria after six months' treatment, 15 after 12 months, and 18 after 24 months. When treatment was stopped the proteinuria reached a median peak of 2.1 g/day (range 0.7-30.7 g/day) at two months (range 1-13 months) before resolving spontaneously, in eight patients by six months, in 13 by 12 months, and in 18 by 24 months. All patients were free of proteinuria by 39 months, the median duration being 11 months. The median first and last measurements of creatinine clearance showed no significant change (77 ml/minute and 59 ml/minute, respectively), and no patient died from or needed treatment for renal failure. HLA-B8 or DR3 alloantigens, or both, were identified in seven patients. Renal biopsy specimens showed membranous glomerulonephritis in 15 patients, a minimal change nephropathy in two, mesangial electron dense deposits in two, and no appreciable glomerular changes in two. In these 21 patients the proteinuria of gold nephropathy resolved completely when treatment was withdrawn. Renal function did not deteriorate, corticosteroids were unnecessary, and several different renal lesions were seen.\r"

Altogether 674 out of 1000 responded, and there was no evidence of a differential response rate between the two trial groups. Similar numbers of women in the two groups reported further deliveries, almost all of which had been vaginal and spontaneous. Fewer women allocated to restrictive use of episiotomy required perineal suturing after subsequent delivery, but this difference was not significant. Pain during sexual intercourse and incontinence of urine were equally reported in the two groups. The similarity in incontinence rates persisted when severity, type of incontinence, and subsequent deliveries were taken into account. Liberal use of episiotomy does not seem to prevent urinary incontinence or increase long term dyspareunia.\r"

Standardised mortality ratios were calculated for the individual practices. Postcodes were available for a 20% sample of these women and were used to retrieve relevant measures of social class and deprivation from the 1981 census for the smallest division, the enumeration district. Weighted averages gave socioeconomic variables at the level of the general practice. High positive correlations were found between standardised mortality ratios and the socioeconomic variables, with the highest being for percentage overcrowding. This study established that the relation between deprivation and excess mortality can be shown in general practices in one large city and gave a direct relation for women without reference to their husbands' occupations, thus obviating problems of assigning social class. The data also partially refute the \"social drift\" hypothesis as an explanation of the association between mortality and social class.\r"

  ".U": "88051673\r", 
  ".W": "Considerable bone loss often occurs after menopause, particularly if menopause is induced by surgery. For perhaps two years bone formation fails to keep pace with the rapid acceleration of bone resorption that occurs after sex hormone withdrawal. The threat that this poses to the integrity of the skeleton is not clear. Because ethical constraints limit histological studies in normal women existing normal data and statistical modelling techniques were used to explore the dynamics of iliac trabecular bone after menopause. Trabeculae are breached during remodelling when the osteoclasts resorb to a depth equal to the trabecular thickness. Since holes in trabecular plates cannot normally be bridged such defects are probably permanent. Men lose 7% of their vertebral trabecular bone every 10 years; deeper than average resorption of trabeculae at the thin end of the normal range would account for it. The dramatic losses of trabecular bone that are seen in some postmenopausal women, however, require a period of imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption since this leads rapidly to generalised thinning. The statistical model suggested that an imbalance lasting only two years may account for eventual losses of up to half of the iliac trabecular bone. Further understanding is needed of what determines the amount of bone lost in the immediate postmenopause, which varies considerably among women. A simple mean is needed of identifying women who will lose bone most rapidly at the menopause. This must be suitable for use in general practice because these women should probably be offered long term hormone replacement treatment within a few months of the last menstruation.\r"

RAWP and the subsequent Advisory Group on Resource Allocation (AGRA) found (but did not publish) considerable variation in resources used by both services but could not find a clear relation between them. Statistics provided by the DHSS were used to compare spending by 80 area health authorities in 1980-1 with expenditure per head on general medical services by their corresponding family practitioner committees. There was considerable variation in the provision of resources for both services and no clear relation between the variations in spending on each service. Only 40 of the 80 areas had both health authority and family practitioner committee spending levels within 10% of \"target.\" Subregional inequalities in resources tend to be related to variations in admission rates, which in turn are related to general practitioners' referral behaviour. These results emphasise the importance of finding out more about inequalities in the provision of general medical services and their relation to the use of hospital services. They also suggest that RAWP's aim of equality of opportunity of access to health care resources may be achieved only if general medical services are brought into the equation as well.\r"

In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from healthy controls (n = 21) hyaluronate concentrations were less than 15 micrograms/l and procollagen peptide concentrations less than 0.2 micrograms/l. Lavage fluid concentrations of these potential markers of fibroblast activation declined during the recovery phase of farmer's lung; four to 10 weeks after admission (n = 7) mean concentrations of hyaluronate and procollagen peptide were 154 (range 38-650) and 4.4 (0.6-15.8) micrograms/l, respectively. At clinical remission six to 14 months after admission concentrations of these markers had returned almost to normal, though slightly increased concentrations were still evident in about half the patients (n = 7). At that time lung volumes were normal but diffusion capacity remained slightly subnormal. It was concluded that in farmer's lung release of hyaluronate and type III procollagen peptide reflects activity of the disease. Increased synthesis of these connective tissue components continuing in a patient avoiding mouldy plant material may signal an increased risk of developing fibrotic lung disease. The abnormal accumulation of hyaluronate in the smaller airways in acute farmer's lung may be expected to immobilize water and thereby provide a possible mechanism of the interstitial inflammatory lung oedema with associated impaired gas diffusion. This hypothesis is supported by the relation found between hyaluronate in lavage fluid and reduced diffusion capacity.\r"

  ".W": "An alcohol consumption survey of 926 people aged 18 or over in England and Wales was conducted by Gallup in 1985. The results were compared with those obtained in a similar survey conducted by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys in 1978. Overall alcohol consumption remained virtually unchanged. Men showed little difference in drinking habits, except for the 18-24 age group, who seemed to be drinking less. For women mean alcohol consumption in 1985 was similar to that in 1978, but more women were not drinking at all so the mean alcohol consumption per drinker had risen. As with earlier work, this study showed that social class had little influence on alcohol consumption, while being married seemed to have a moderating effect. A variable regional pattern of alcohol intake was found. In a separate analysis under-age drinking was common among 16-17 year olds (65%). Their pattern of drinking was similar to that of other age groups, except for those over 65 years, who drank less. Change in alcohol intake in the UK over the seven years was in the middle of the range of values for other European countries. The stable UK overall consumption was perhaps due to the constant relative price of alcohol.\r"
