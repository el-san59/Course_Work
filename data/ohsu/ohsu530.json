  ".W": "In this paper, the authors present a deterministic simulation model, which they call Simulift, of trunk-muscle activity and intra-abdominal pressure during a sagittally symmetric trunk exertion. Simulift is a descriptive model that quantifies the time-varying loading of the spine based on observed internal forces. Recent findings about the time sequence of events during trunk motion and established equilibrium formulas provide the theoretical bases for the simulation. A profile of electromyographic activity in ten trunk muscles and intra-abdominal pressure is updated as simulated time passes, or as the trunk motion is simulated. Input to the model includes a list of motion-event times and a set of profile-component-behavior data. Simulift is an \"impulse\" model that computes instantaneous and time-integrated statistics on individual muscle activity, intra-abdominal pressure, compression, lateral shear, and anterior shear as the profile components of the simulated subject change. Computer results for the simulation model are presented.\r"

  ".W": "In order to standardize the results of different biomechanical studies concerning stresses on lumbar discs, it may be useful to estimate the disc dimensions of the examined subjects and to refer the stress values to a unit surface area (square centimeter). The association between anthropometric parameters and discal areas at the L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels, examined by computed axial tomography, was studied in a group of 32 subjects (16 male; 16 female) with the aim of estimating lumbar disc areas with a simple method. Bony structure weight, which is computed by an equation that takes into account the diameters of the wrist, elbow, knee, and ankle and the stature, is the anthropometric parameter best associated with the areas of lumbar discs. The wrist diameter also shows a good association with the same areas. On the contrary, the association between body weight and disc areas was found to be less adequate for this purpose. The equations of the relative regression lines are reported as well as the criteria for their practical applications.\r"

A branch of the sciatic nerve was stimulated with voltage impulses of constant amplitude (40 V) and duration (0.1 msec) at the right external malleolus. The responses were recorded at the dorsal root entry zone L1. The authors used different doses of chymopapain (low dose = 100 IU, middle dose = 250 IU, and high dose = 500 IU). The control rats were subjected to exactly the same stimulus and recording procedures, but the test solution was a corresponding volume of isotonic saline. The prolongation of the latency of the electrically evoked potential due to chymopapain is very clear at the doses of 250 IU and 500 IU, being about 10 to 15% relative to the mean latency before application of the drug. This study indicates that locally applied chymopapain has a dose-dependent effect on nerve conduction properties.\r"

Sham operated animals and an unoperated control group were used for comparison. Half of the operated animals were housed under conditions to promote higher physical activity than the other animals housed individually in small cages. Acutely, the removal of facet joints increased the flexibility of intervertebral joints. Over the following year, this increase in flexibility was reduced to close to control levels in all groups of animals. Within the intervertebral discs, there was no significant change in proportions or solubility of collagen or proteoglycans after surgery, nor was there microscopic or macroscopic evidence of disc degeneration. The surgical procedure produced hypermobility of the spine, but there was a subsequent restabilization, and the intended disc degeneration was not produced. These findings indicate that some as yet unidentified soft tissue repair process, facilitated by activity, overcame the hypermobility created at surgery, so degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs did not result. We suggest that other animal models of disc degeneration may represent a failure of reparative response to acute injury.\r"

The presence or absence of thoracic curves was correctly shown by the topograms in 77% of cases, and in the lower region (lumbar and thoracolumbar curves) in 79% of cases. For correctly identified curves, the greatest back surface rotation was, on average, 1.0 vertebral levels below the skeletal curve apex in the thoracic region and 0.5 levels below the apex in the lower region. The moire fringe with the greatest asymmetry occurred on average at 1.5 and 1.8 vertebral levels above the spinal apex in upper and lower regions, respectively. The magnitude of the Cobb angle was determined to within +/- 5 degrees in 24% of cases by moire measurements, and in 27% by the raster technique. The side of the scoliosis was incorrectly diagnosed by topography in ten patients with minimal or 'nonstandard' vertebral rotation. It was concluded that the presence, level, and side of a scoliosis curvature is well demonstrated by back surface topography in patients with 'standard' rotation, but the magnitude of the scoliosis cannot be determined from topograms sufficiently accurately for most clinical purposes.\r"

  ".W": "Augmentation of lumbar spine fusion with internal fixation using pedicle screw systems has gained wide currency because it offers rigid stabilization to foster fusion healing. The AO DCP plate has been employed in Europe as a spinal implant with pedicle fixation using 6.5 mm, full-threaded cancellous bone screws with success. This report details the experience of using this device for lumbar spine fusion in a series of 46 North American patients with a mean follow-up of 1.25 years (range 1-2.5 years). Thirty-one patients had had prior lumbar spine surgery with poor outcomes, and 15 had had no prior surgery. All were treated surgically for lumbar degenerative disease with canal decompression, internal fixation with AO plates, and fusion with autologous bone grafting posterolaterally. Complications included two early and one delayed wound infection; five cases of screw loosening; three cases of screw breakage; and three cases of screw impingement upon a nerve. Results of surgery in 17 patients with failed interbody fusion included good to excellent pain relief in 59%, and solid fusion in 76%. In 14 patients with failed posterior surgery the good to excellent pain relief rate was 79%, and the fusion rate was 86%. In 15 patients undergoing primary surgery there was 89% good to excellent pain relief and a solid fusion rate of 87%. The benefits accruing from augmentation of the fusion with internal fixation using AO DCP plates are positive and justify its continued use. Complications encountered in the early experience have been significantly reduced in subsequent series, indicating the existence of a \"learning curve\" effect which would mandate specific training of spinal surgeons in the technique.\r"

  ".W": "A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model has been used to predict the strain in the disc fibers of a lumbar motion segment under various single and combined loads such as those representing symmetric and non-symmetric liftings. A progressive failure analysis also has been performed under loads representing lifting while bending to one side: assuming yield and ultimate fiber strains of 14 and 16%, respectively. Large tensile strains of about 10% in the disc fibers are predicted under the maximum loads simulating symmetric lifting. Addition of lateral bending and twisting significantly increases the maximum fiber strain to more than 20%, and hence augments the risk for disc rupture. The maximum fiber strain occurs in the innermost annulus layer at the posterolateral location. Loss of intradiscal pressure or volume has a marked diminishing effect on the magnitude of maximum fiber strain predicted under flexion loadings. Failure analysis indicates that rupture initiates in the fibers in the innermost layer at the posterolateral location. With a slight increase in the loads, rupture progresses radially to the adjacent outer layer. Further progress of rupture in the fibers toward the annulus outer periphery resulting in complete radial fissure and disc prolapse appears to require additional increase in the loads. In the presence of large intradiscal pressure, the generated partial or complete radial fissure is likely to result in annulus protrusion or disc herniation, respectively. The results of clinical, epidemiologic, and experimental studies support the failure mechanism predicted in the present study.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred forty consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction treated within 48 hours by successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were analyzed to determine the incidence and predictors of recurrent ischemic events during hospitalization. Thirty-nine patients had recurrent ischemia: 20 patients had chest pain or electrocardiographic changes requiring repeat PTCA or bypass surgery, or resulting in a second creatine kinase elevation suggestive of myocardial infarction; 12 had total occlusion of the dilated artery on follow-up angiography; and 7 had exercise-induced ischemia and greater than or equal to 70% diameter stenosis that required PTCA or bypass surgery before hospital discharge. In-hospital mortality was 15% in the recurrent ischemia group, compared to 1% in the group without recurrent myocardial ischemia (p less than 0.001). Angiographic follow-up before hospital discharge was obtained in 198 patients, including 38 of the 39 patients with ischemic events. Thus, the true incidence of recurrent ischemic events was between 39 of 199 and 39 of 240, or 16 and 20%. In multivariate analyses, recurrent ischemia was predicted by translesional gradient greater than 25 mm Hg (p = 0.001), dissection (p = 0.01) and post-PTCA Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 2 flow pattern (p = 0.016). However, even in the absence of these risk factors recurrent ischemic events occurred in 13% of patients. Post-PTCA percent diameter stenosis (whether assessed by objective or visual assessment), degree of the early systemic fibrinolytic state, post-PTCA residual minimal diameter and concomitant use of thrombolytic agents were not predictive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When peak plasma creatine kinase concentrations were included with the individual fatty acid levels in a multiple logistic regression, only creatine kinase correlated significantly with ventricular arrhythmias (p less than 0.01). Thus, saturated fatty acids in cardiac membranes may lead to greater vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias, although infarct size is the only statistically significant predictor after multiple regression analysis.\r"

All 14 patients referred for coronary bypass surgery belonged to the group with ischemic episodes (p less than 0.02). The extent of coronary disease, the treadmill test parameters, and the duration and frequency of ischemia during daily activities were identical in the patients with and without subsequent cardiac events. Patients with only symptomatic ischemic episodes or those with both silent and symptomatic episodes had a frequency of cardiac events similar to that of patients with only silent episodes.

The mean anginal weekly frequency per patient was significantly reduced, from 3.4 to 0.5 (p less than 0.001). The left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac volumes, ejection and filling indexes at rest and for the same workload were not altered in the population as a whole or in each of the 2 groups. The rate pressure product during exercise was reduced for the same workload from 18.0 +/- 5.0 X 10(3) to 16.8 +/- 4.7 X 10(3), while the regional ejection fraction in ischemic regions was not significantly changed.

Gallopamil increased the total duration of exercise from 432 +/- 201 to 537 +/- 188 s (p less than 0.001). Six patients did not complain of angina and their exercise was interrupted because of muscular weakness. The hemodynamic and clinical responses did not differ when the results in the population as a whole and in each of the 2 groups were compared. Gallopamil was effective and well tolerated, even in patients with very depressed cardiac function.\r"

Each patient received 6 to 18 (11 +/- 3) endocardial cryothermic applications (15 mm, -60 degrees C, 2 minutes) at areas of earliest activation during VT. Encircling endocardial cryoablation was performed in 4 patients who had unsuccessful mapping. In addition, 11 patients had subendocardial resection of their well-demarcated septal scars as well as cryosurgery. There were 2 in-hospital deaths. At postoperative programmed ventricular stimulation, 28 of the 37 patients (76%) had no inducible or spontaneous VT before hospital discharge. Six patients (16%) with spontaneous or inducible VT had a single morphology and were controlled with antiarrhythmic drugs that had previously failed. Therefore, surgery alone or in combination with drugs was efficacious in 92% of the population surviving surgery. The remaining 3 patients (8%) received automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators. No significant difference in surgical outcome was seen between patients who had cryosurgery alone and those who had subendocardial resection together with cryoablation. Mean left ventricular ejection fractions before and after surgery were 33 and 39%, respectively (p less than 0.01). Clinical follow-up ranged from 2 to 36 months (18 +/- 12). One patient died of heart failure and another underwent heart transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aim was to evaluate the occurrence, type and electrophysiologic effects of bundle branch block (BBB) during ORT onset. Of the 58 infants, 25 (43%) had BBB with pacing-induced tachycardia onset. BBB was initiated by single or double premature atrial extrastimuli and by burst atrial pacing; 4 infants also demonstrated BBB with spontaneous ORT onset during transesophageal study. Two of 25 infants had BBB only after intravenous procainamide. Comparison of the 25 infants exhibiting BBB at ORT onset with the 33 infants not demonstrating BBB revealed that age was not statistically different in the 2 groups, but that severity of illness (based on a 1 to 3 scale) was greater (p less than 0.05) and normal QRS ORT cycle length was shorter (p less than 0.02) in the infants with BBB. Of the 25 infants with BBB at ORT onset, 17 had left BBB, 3 had right BBB and 5 had both left and right BBB. Ventriculoatrial interval or cycle length increases during ORT with BBB in 16 of 25 (64%) infants suggested left free wall-accessory atrioventricular connections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subjects with mitral prolapse were similar to control subjects and differed (p less than 0.025 to p less than 0.001) from the patients with Marfan syndrome in aortic root dimensions, height, arm span, upper/lower segment ratio and prevalences of arachnodactyly, scoliosis and pectus carinatum. Subjects with mitral prolapse and patients with Marfan syndrome had similar body mass indexes and prevalences of pectus excavatum and straight back. All 3 groups were similar in arm span/height ratio. The 5 subjects with MVP and arachnodactyly had lower weights, smaller body surface areas and smaller aortic root dimensions, and were more likely to have scoliosis than subjects with MVP without arachnodactyly. Thus, primary MVP differs from the Marfan syndrome in all major skeletal and cardiovascular features.\r"

In group 2 the aortic root was also measured by M-mode echocardiography and was compared to measurements during surgery. Growth curves of the normal aortic root were obtained. In group 2 the aortic root was smaller than normal except in 3 patients. When corrected for body surface area all were smaller than normal.

When resting resistance was less than or equal to 7.9 U . m2, it always decreased with isoproterenol and no postoperative problems were experienced with pulmonary vascular obstructive disease. In 36 patients resting resistance measured greater than or equal to 8 U . m2. In 17 of these patients it decreased to less than 7 U . m2 with isoproterenol. Fifteen patients were operated on and postoperative problems with pulmonary vascular disease were experienced only in the single patient whose repair broke down. Surgery was undertaken in 4 of 19 patients in whom resistance did not decrease to less than 7 U . m2 with isoproterenol and advanced pulmonary vascular disease was evident in the 3 patients with follow-up observation. Correlation between measured resistance and other hemodynamic parameters was only fair. A pulmonary to systemic resistance ratio greater than or equal to 0.75 always indicated high absolute resistance but resistance ratios less than 0.75 were found quite frequently in the group with limited response to isoproterenol. These data argue that a reliable estimate of resistance, less than 7 U . m2, with a vasodilator predicts a good postoperative response regardless of measurements at rest or other hemodynamic parameters. Although observations on postoperative progress of patients with resistance greater than 7 U . m2 with a vasodilator are limited, a good postoperative course is unlikely unless resistance can be lowered to a level close to 7 U . m2.\r"

The patients included 35 children whose age at operation was 12 +/- 16 days and whose weight was 3.6 +/- 0.4 kg. Thirty-three patients are alive and well; 1 died intraoperatively and 1 died immediately postoperatively. The time of the follow-up echocardiographic examination ranged from 1 day to 2.5 years (mean 9.2 months) with 11 patients examined greater than 1 year after surgery. Complete examination of the repair site was possible in all patients. Echocardiographic visualization of distortion of the great arteries at the suture lines was seen in all patients; however, Doppler evidence of hemodynamically significant obstruction at the repair site was uncommon. On Doppler examination in the surviving 33 patients, 16 had no supravalvular pulmonary stenosis and 14 had mild to moderate supravalvular pulmonary stenosis with peak systolic pressure gradients ranging from 16 to 56 mm Hg (mean 31). Three patients had severe supravalvular pulmonary stenosis and peak systolic pressure gradients of 66, 74 and 77 mm Hg (2 have had reoperation, 1 is awaiting surgery). On Doppler examination, 4 patients had mild supravalvular aortic stenosis with peak systolic gradients ranging from 10 to 29 mm Hg. Doppler gradients were confirmed in 10 patients who had catheterization 12 +/- 3 months after surgery. Three patients had mild pulmonary regurgitation by Doppler examination, 5 had mild aortic regurgitation, 4 had mild tricuspid regurgitation and 2 had mild mitral regurgitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fourteen subjects, including 4 strength-trained (discus and shot put), 4 endurance-trained (long distance runners), 4 decathlon-trained (strength and endurance), 2 wheelchair athletes and 31 college-age control subjects were evaluated using electrocardiography, M-mode echocardiography and maximal oxygen consumption. M-mode echocardiography measurements of left ventricular structure and function were compared before and after normalization for lean body weight. As expected, endurance athletes had greater maximal O2 consumption than the other groups (p less than 0.05). Before normalization for lean body weight, there were no significant differences in end-diastolic dimensions. After normalization, the endurance, wheelchair and control subjects had end-diastolic dimensions larger than those of strength athletes. Strength athletes appeared to have a much larger posterior wall and septal thickness than all groups except the decathlon athletes. However, when normalized, there was no difference among any of the groups. Previous investigators have attempted to determine \"normalcy\" of cardiac hypertrophy by looking at the ratio of left ventricular wall thickness to left ventricular radius. In the present study, the thickness to radius ratio in strength athletes was 33% greater than that in endurance athletes. It appears that the left ventricular wall thickness in the strength athletes occurred without a concomitant increase in left ventricular radius and that the left ventricular hypertrophy of world class athletes is related to the total increase in lean body weight. However, ventricular dimensions may be related more to the type of overload experienced.\r"

The dominant cardiac lesion of carcinoid heart disease by echocardiography and Doppler was severe tricuspid regurgitation with right ventricular volume overload. A characteristic finding was thickened, retracted tricuspid valve leaflets that were fixed in a partially open position. Carcinoid heart disease was progressive and often fatal. The 17 patients with echocardiographic evidence of carcinoid heart disease had higher peak levels of urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (331 +/- 231 vs 58 +/- 78 mg, p less than 0.001) and more severe hepatic dysfunction than the 13 patients without carcinoid heart disease. Although duration of symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome before echocardiography was similar for patients with and without carcinoid heart disease (5.4 +/- 6.4 vs 6.2 +/- 5.9 years, respectively, p greater than 0.1), survival after echocardiography was shorter for those with carcinoid heart disease (1.9 +/- 1.4 vs 3.8 +/- 2.9 years, p = 0.05). The findings support the concept that long-term exposure of the endocardium to serotonin in the right side of the heart leads to the development of heart lesions; in addition, progressive hepatic dysfunction may allow more serotonin to bypass liver enzymes and reach the right side of the heart.\r"

In patients with acute intracranial hypertension due to mass-expanding lesions such as brain edema, hydrocephalus or brain tumor, cerebral perfusion pressure decreases and plateau waves occur. In experimental animals, spontaneous or induced arterial hypertension can compensate for the reduction of cerebral perfusion pressure. The interrelation between arterial pressure, intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure in an experimental model of hydrocephalus in dogs was investigated. Plateau waves were preceded by a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure and a Cushing response was seen 5 to 15 seconds before abolition of the wave. Arterial hypertension, induced by intravenous infusion of Aramin, restored cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure became normal. Arterial hypertension appears to be an efficient stimulus to abort plateau waves. Hypertensive patients in whom subarachnoid bleeding develops from ruptured aneurysm are at high risk of bleeding again and need antihypertensive treatment together with drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. Induced arterial hypertension is the most effective treatment of vasospasm but increases the danger of aneurysmal rebleeding and can only be safe after clipping of the aneurysm. This is one of the strongest arguments for early operation on cerebral aneurysms.\r"

Such emergencies include hypertensive crisis, acute left ventricular heart failure or intracranial bleeding in patients with hypertension, malignant hypertension resistant to treatment, and serious blood pressure elevations after vascular surgery. A hypertensive crisis may be defined as a sudden increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure that causes functional disturbances of the central nervous system, the heart or the kidneys. In patients with hypertensive crisis, treatment should be started with an alpha receptor-blocking agent if pheochromocytoma has not been excluded by previous workup. Antihypertensive agents with a rapid onset of action--nifedipine, clonidine, dihydralazine, diazoxide and sodium nitroprusside--are being used.\r"

Maximal oxygen uptake was measured during both exercise modalities; cardiac output was measured only during cycle ergometry using the acetylene rebreathing technique. Both drugs reduced resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Prazosin reduced total peripheral resistance during submaximal exercise but had little effect on maximal cycle and treadmill performance. Atenolol, in contrast, reduced treadmill duration, maximal oxygen uptake, and heart rate compared with placebo. Atenolol also increased stroke volume and the arterial venous oxygen difference and reduced cardiac output during cycle exercise. Both drugs produced similar reductions in exercise diastolic pressure, but exercise systolic pressure was lower only during atenolol treatment. Prazosin was better tolerated by the subjects and was preferred by 10 of the men. We conclude that both drugs effectively reduced resting blood pressure, but that atenolol decreased exercise cardiac output and may impede exercise performance in physically active hypertensive subjects.\r"

Administration of prazosin (2 mg/kg bodyweight, orally, twice a day) for three weeks caused significant reductions in plasma cholesterol, including low- plus very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and triglyceride levels. Drug therapy was associated with increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, although in one group of monkeys this rise also was associated with a reduction in apolipoprotein A1. Prazosin treatment significantly decreased mean arterial pressure in normal and hypercholesterolemic monkeys. As was expected, acute administration of phenylephrine caused mean arterial pressure to rise, with animals receiving normal- or high-cholesterol-containing diets showing similar responses. After prazosin treatment, however, a greater inhibition in the phenylephrine pressor response was observed in hypercholesterolemic monkeys compared with normal animals. Platelet aggregation in response to adenosine 5'-diphosphate, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time were not altered by prazosin. Thus, in our nonhuman primate models of hypercholesterolemia, administration of prazosin resulted in reduction in lipid and apoprotein levels with no change in hemostasis.\r"

The study population consisted predominantly of white men (mean age, 67.5 years) with mild-to-moderate hypertension and coexisting hypercholesterolemia (mean plasma cholesterol level, 244 mg/dl). Both agents resulted in statistically significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure. It is recognized that with prazosin use, there are generally no adverse changes noted between pre- and post-treatment lipid levels. The results of this study demonstrated a 243.5 mg/dl total cholesterol level at baseline and 229.5 mg/dl maintenance levels following prazosin treatment. In contrast, the results following propranolol treatment showed a tendency to increase plasma levels of triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and to reduce levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol. Because of a great deal of variability in lipid responsiveness to the study drug, none of the above changes attained statistical significance.

Lipid levels did not change, except that low-density lipoprotein levels decreased from 148 to 127 mg/dl with prazosin. Atenolol did not change forearm or finger blood flow or vascular resistance. Prazosin increased blood flow and reduced vascular resistance in both finger and forearm.

Seventy-seven percent of patients achieved the goal sitting diastolic blood pressure of 85 mm Hg or less. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were not significantly altered during prazosin therapy compared with baseline measurements. Diabetic control and renal function were maintained during prazosin treatment with no significant changes from baseline noted. No unexpected adverse experiences were reported.

Although the hypertrophic response can be considered an adaptive mechanism in the initial stages, its progression is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy may provide considerable clinical benefits to hypertensive patients. Although treatment of hypertension per se is important, blood pressure alone may not explain the course of the hypertrophic process. Not all antihypertensive drugs cause a reversal of hypertrophy, though they may produce equal effects on blood pressure. Factors other than the severity of blood pressure may play a role in the genesis of left ventricular hypertrophy. Adrenergic inhibitors cause its regression, whereas direct vasodilators may promote progression. In this study, therapy with the alpha-adrenergic inhibitor prazosin resulted in significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in a group of patients with moderate-to-severe hypertension. This study utilized a new technique--[123I]phenylpentadecanoic acid myocardioscintigraphy--to measure the left ventricular mass. In this study, it was shown that monotherapy with prazosin produced significant relative reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, along with significant reductions in left ventricular mass.\r"

The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 132.5 +/- 8.1 mg/dl at baseline, 136.9 +/- 8.3 mg/dl with propranolol treatment, and 129.4 +/- 9.0 mg/dl with prazosin treatment (0.05 less than p less than 0.10 between-group comparison). The data indicated that whereas prazosin and propranolol are equally effective in controlling blood pressure in hypertensive cigarette smokers, effects on plasma lipoproteins also may need to be considered when selecting a first-step antihypertensive agent in this coronary-prone population.\r"

Twelve patients were randomly assigned to prazosin treatment and 15 to treatment with atenolol. Drug therapy was titrated to reduce diastolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg or to below 89 mm Hg, whichever was lower. If monotherapy with either study drug failed to do this, hydrochlorothiazide was added to the regimen. Once blood pressure control was established, patients received maintenance therapy at that dosage and were followed for up to 12 months. Blood pressure, side effects, and plasma lipid levels were monitored during this period. Seventy-five percent of patients receiving prazosin monotherapy attained blood pressure goals, compared with 60 percent of patients given atenolol monotherapy. With the addition of low-dose hydrochlorothiazide, those patients not having an adequate response to monotherapy attained blood pressure control. Blood pressure reductions were maintained without dosage adjustment throughout the maintenance period; patient acceptance was good, and there was no evidence of tolerance. Treatment with atenolol produced slight increases in plasma triglyceride levels and little change in total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In contrast, patients treated with prazosin demonstrated no adverse effects with regard to lipid levels. Although a higher percentage of patients reached goal blood pressure with prazosin monotherapy than with atenolol, the response rates were comparable when hydrochlorothiazide was added to the regimens.\r"

After eight weeks of placebo administration, patients were randomly assigned to treatment with prazosin or enalapril and then treated with the alternate drug after a second eight-week placebo washout period. The dose was titrated from 1 mg to a maximum of 10 mg twice daily of prazosin and from 2.5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg twice daily of enalapril to achieve a reduction in diastolic blood pressure to less than 85 mm Hg, with a decrease of at least 10 mm Hg based on clinical measurements of blood pressure. Patients received maintenance therapy with each medication for at least eight weeks. The response to therapy was then evaluated with two-hour periods of automated blood pressure monitoring. Average systolic and diastolic blood pressures for all patients during these two-hour monitoring periods decreased by 10.3 +/- 1.9/8.3 +/- 1.5 mm Hg during prazosin therapy and by 9.0 +/- 5.1/5.8 +/- 3.4 mm Hg during enalapril therapy. All patients responded to one of the two drugs, but only 50 percent responded to both. Side effects were generally mild and transient, and no significant metabolic effects were observed. Both prazosin and enalapril were effective and well tolerated in this population of elderly patients with mild hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to compare the effects of treatment with prazosin, propranolol, or hydrochlorothiazide on the following variables: blood pressure, cognitive and psychomotor skills, cardiovascular reactivity to natural and laboratory challenges, and serum lipid and lipoprotein levels. Side effects were recorded and patients evaluated how they felt during their treatment. Sixty-nine men, 35 percent black, aged 25 to 55 (mean 51.3) years, with diastolic blood pressures between 90 and 104 mm Hg (mean, 93.3 mm Hg), completed the study. There were no differences between active treatment groups in the proportion of patients with controlled blood pressure during the maintenance phase of the study. In the cognitive and psychomotor tests, the hydrochlorothiazide group showed significantly less improvement from baseline than the other treatment groups on the block design subscale of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, and there was a trend for the propranolol group to have less improvement from baseline than the other groups on the digit span subscale. There were no other significant pretreatment to post-treatment changes in the other cognitive or psychomotor tests, the Russell Revision of the Wechsler Memory Scale, or a number of computerized reaction-time and signal-detection tasks. In the reactivity testing, there was a significantly lower increase in heart rate in the prazosin group compared with placebo during the second laboratory challenge of the Stroop Color Interference Test. Post-treatment declines in ambulatory blood pressure were seen in all of the drug treatment groups in average and maximal diastolic and systolic blood pressures. Both propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide treatment resulted in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that were higher than baseline and the hydrochlorothiazide treatment had significantly increased total cholesterol levels. In contrast, the prazosin-treated group experienced no adverse changes in these parameters. Overall, the propranolol group had significantly more moderate and severe side effects than did the other three groups. Considering the pattern of blood pressure control, cognitive and psychomotor effects, changes in lipid levels, and magnitude of side effects, prazosin seems to have the most advantageous profile in this study of the three anti-hypertensive agents evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Elderly and younger patients who were successfully resuscitated and hospitalized following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were studied to determine if there was a significant difference in hospital course and long-term survival between the two groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 214 consecutive patients, divided into two age groups: elderly (more than 70 years, n = 112) and younger (less than 70 years, n = 102). Hospital charts and paramedic run data were retrospectively reviewed for each patient and findings were compared between the two age groups. RESULTS: Prior to cardiac arrest, 47 of 112 (42 percent) elderly patients had a history of heart failure, compared with 19 of 102 (18 percent) younger patients, and were more commonly taking digitalis (51 percent versus 29 percent) and diuretics (47 percent versus 26 percent). Younger patients, however, more often had an acute myocardial infarction at the time of the cardiac arrest (33 percent versus 16 percent). At the time of cardiac arrest, 83 percent of younger patients demonstrated ventricular fibrillation, compared with 71 percent of the elderly. In contrast, electromechanical dissociation was five times more common in the elderly patients. Although hospital deaths were more common in the elderly (71 percent versus 53 percent), the length of hospitalization and stay in intensive care units were not significantly different between the age groups. The number of neurologic deaths was similar in both age groups, as were residual neurologic impairments. Only five elderly patients and six younger patients required placement in extended-care facilities. Calculated long-term survival curves demonstrated similar survival in both age groups, with approximately 65 percent of hospital survivors alive at 24 months after hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: Resuscitation of elderly patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurs is reasonable and appropriate, according to the findings of this study. Even though elderly patients are more likely than younger patients to die during hospitalization, the hospital stay of the elderly is not longer, the elderly do not have more residual neurologic impairments, and survival after hospital discharge is similar to that in younger patients.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the hypothesis that less aggressive cancer screening practices might result in later diagnosis of cancer in the elderly, we analyzed the stage of diagnosis of tumors by age in the Connecticut Tumor Registry. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using Registry data from 1960 to 1975 and 1976 to 1983, we compared the proportion of tumors that were diagnosed at a localized stage among white women of various age groups. Thirteen specific tumor sites were analyzed, accounting for 55,688 tumors between 1960 and 1975 and 38,715 tumors between 1976 and 1983. RESULTS: Only gynecologic cancers demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between the relative proportion of tumors that were diagnosed at a localized stage and advancing patient age during both time periods. Specifically, when the youngest women (aged 25 to 34) were compared with the oldest women (aged 85 and over), between 1960 and 1975, the relative proportion of localized cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer dropped from 98 percent to 59 percent, 92 percent to 77 percent, and 59 percent to 27 percent, respectively. Similar declines were also seen between the intermediate-age groups, and data from 1976 to 1983 demonstrated identical age-related trends. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that the probability of diagnosing cancer of the cervix, uterus and ovaries at a localized and potentially curable stage decreases with advancing age. Published national health practice patterns demonstrated a similar age-related decline in gynecologic examinations and Pap smears even after adjustment for the exclusion of women who would have undergone previous hysterectomy. This decreasing use of gynecologic examinations may in part explain the age-related decline in localized gynecologic cancers.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fewer than 8 percent of intravenous drug abusers are found to have polymicrobial endocarditis. We report on cases of occult polymicrobial infective endocarditis with Haemophilus parainfluenzae in 10 intravenous drug abusers. Clinical and laboratory data on all 10 patients were obtained from hospital charts, and information on illicit drug use methods was given by five patients. Blood cultures were performed, as well as susceptibility testing to antibiotics. Subsequent molecular epidemiologic studies were performed on selected Staphylococcus aureus and H. parainfluenzae strains. Phage typing of S. aureus and biotyping of H. parainfluenzae strains were also done. RESULTS: Results of the initial blood cultures were positive on the second to fifth days (mean, 2.6 days), demonstrating a gram-positive pathogen in nine patients and Bacteroides asaccharolyticus in one. Significantly, in each case, H. parainfluenzae alone was subsequently identified from additional blood cultures, with a mean delay of 20.4 days (range, five to 57 days) to the isolation of this organism. Epidemiologic data indicated that our cases did not represent a point-source outbreak. Antibiotic therapy uniformly failed until an agent active against H. parainfluenzae was added. The constellation of clinical, microbiologic, and epidemiologic findings was similar, and permitted prospective diagnosis and therapy in three patients. Despite the absence of S. aureus bacteremia in four, all 10 patients had right-sided endocarditis with septic pulmonary emboli. Five patients had initial blood cultures that were positive for two facultative gram-positive cocci (S. aureus and commensal oral streptococcal species). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that polymicrobial endocarditis with H. parainfluenzae in intravenous drug abusers is a distinct clinical syndrome, and should be considered in all patients if the response to appropriate antibiotics is atypical or if pulmonary emboli continue with therapy.\r"

Variable amounts of atracurium were incubated in saline (0.9% NaCl) for 120 minutes at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C. Subsequently, cysteine was added to the incubation solutions and the incubation was continued at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C. Frequent determination of the mercapto groups of cysteine revealed a progressive diminution of the mercapto groups remaining in the incubation solutions. The consumption of sulfhydryl groups was maximal at 20 minutes after the addition of cysteine and amounted to approximately twice the molar amount of atracurium. Kinetic analysis indicated that one mercapto group was consumed almost instantly, whereas the consumption of the other proceeded with a half-life of 4 minutes. No consumption of mercapto groups was observed when laudanosine was incubated with cysteine. Incubation of atracurium or of its degradation products with carboxylesterase markedly reduced the amount of reactive metabolites present in the incubation solutions. The results are compatible with the working hypothesis that spontaneous degradation of atracurium via Hofmann elimination results in generation of two equivalents of reactive electrophilic esters, probably acrylates. We propose that in vivo the portion of the aliphatic chain in the atracurium molecule that is converted to acrylates by Hofmann elimination may be eliminated in part in urine as a conjugate of mercapturic acid.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years transient primary hypothyroidism has reported with increasing frequency. Physicians are often unsure whether withdrawal of thyroid hormone to identify the transient hypothyroidism is indicated and cost-effective and in which patients this should be done. To study these questions, thyroid hormone therapy was withdrawn from 63 patients with proven primary hypothyroidism at 6 months and again at 1 and 3 years to determine if there was recovery of thyroid function. Of the 49 patients with primary hypothyroidism (PH) that was not attributable to such causes as drug therapy, surgery, iodine-131 therapy, or silent or subacute thyroiditis, only two patients recovered thyroid function. In the other 14 patients, hypothyroidism developed within 6 months postpartum. Nine of these 14 recovered thyroid function. Therefore, it appears that when PH is not related to certain specific causes or states, it is likely to be permanent. Furthermore, withdrawal of thyroid hormone therapy to assess recovery of thyroid function is unnecessary and not cost-effective.\r"

Among 644 patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), 6 patients (0.9%) suffered peripheral vascular complications, whereas 35 of 2904 patients having cardiac catheterizations (1.2%) had a peripheral vascular complication. The types of complications associated with both procedures were similar and included groin hematomas, false aneurysms, arterial dissection, arterial perforation, and neurological deficits. The frequency of surgical repair of these complications also was similar in the two groups (50% required repair for a PTCA complication, 34% were repaired after a catheterization complication). The PTCA-associated complications included one myocardial infarction and one death, whereas neither of these occurred in association with a catheterization-induced vascular complication. The surgical management of five of the six PTCA complications was difficult, largely because of the size of the sheath-related puncture site and the presence of active bleeding from the associated systemic anticoagulation. PTCA carries the same risk of development of a peripheral vascular complication as found in transfemoral cardiac catheterization. Care must be taken to prevent sheath-related injury to the aorta-iliac-femoral system and hemorrhagic complications at the puncture site are of particular concern and require urgent surgical attention.\r"

With decreasing dollars available for building new research laboratories in medical schools, the assignment of laboratory space to basic science and clinical departments presents a difficult problem for deans, chairmen, and faculty. In this article, the authors outline a formula in which net square feet of traditional research space (ie, wet-bench laboratories) may be allocated on the basis of research dollars, output of manuscripts and abstracts averaged over 3 years, and the number of personnel who will use the space. Caution is urged for arbitrarily applying a space formula when it does not apply, ie, nontraditional research, and when insufficient consideration has been given to the individual case. The formula is most useful when applied within a specific institution and primarily for comparative purposes. Nonetheless, once the formula is established, it provides an objective mechanism by which the need for space and the relative merits of space assignments within a department or among departments can be more effectively determined and managed.\r"

Thyroidal gallium-67 uptake has been reported to occur frequently with subacute thyroiditis, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, and thyroid lymphoma, and occasionally with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and follicular thyroid carcinoma. A patient is described with progressive systemic sclerosis who, while being scanned for possible active pulmonary involvement, was found incidentally to have abnormal gallium-67 uptake only in the thyroid gland. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid revealed Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Although Hashimoto's thyroiditis occurs with increased frequency in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis, thyroidal uptake of gallium-67 associated with progressive systemic sclerosis has not, to our knowledge, been previously described. Since aggressive thyroid malignancies frequently are imaged by gallium-67 scintigraphy, fine needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid often is essential in the evaluation of thyroidal gallium-67 uptake.\r"

Preoperatively, pharmacologic blockade of excessive catecholamine secretion with prazocin controlled her blood pressure, tachycardia, and symptoms. The tumor was resected and its catecholamine content measured. This case is reported to stress the importance of adequate preoperative assessment of patients with paragangliomas of the head and neck. The extreme rarity of catecholamine-secreting tumors of this region should not lead us to underestimate the morbidity and mortality of such patients undergoing surgery or any other invasive procedure whether the diagnosis is confirmed or only suspected.\r"

Vigorous local immune response develops with the infection, which never succeeds in eradicating bacteria but does limit the infection and provides a diagnostic test: the antibody-coated bacteria test. Emphasis is placed on the need for a localization test for upper tract infection because studies based exclusively on clinical criteria are invalid. Appropriate therapy for mildly ill patients is given with recommendations of combination therapy for severely ill persons. Long-term follow-up is critical because most patients with recurrent infections can be given preventive therapy without subjecting them to needless urologic evaluation.\r"

The authors examined the relationship between TLI and KGF in 36 breast lesions (28 invasive ductal carcinomas and 8 benign lesions). TLI and KGF values were determined in separately labeled tissue sections as well as in frozen tissue sections labeled with both Ki-67 and tritiated thymidine. In separately labeled sections of carcinoma mean TLI was 6.8 while mean KGF was 16.0. For double-labeled sections of carcinoma mean TLI and KGF values were 6.1 and 16.4, respectively. Strong correlation between TLI and KGF of malignant tumors was found by both methods: r = 0.90 (P less than 0.001) for separately labeled sections, and r = 0.96 (P less than 0.001) for double-labeled sections. In double-labeled sections of benign lesions strong correlation between TLI and KGF also was observed (r = 0.94, P less than 0.001); however, in separately labeled benign breast tissue there was no significant correlation between TLI and KGF (r = 0.38). This may have been the result of variable sampling of small proliferative foci in separate sections of benign breast tissue. The strong correlation between TLI and KGF in breast carcinoma suggests that KGF may have prognostic implications similar to those of the TLI.\r"

The authors have performed a series of studies to elucidate early pathogenetic events at sites of fiber deposition in asbestos-exposed rats. This study reports that a single 5-hour exposure to chrysotile asbestos induces significant increases in incorporation of tritiated thymidine (3HTdR) into nuclei of epithelial and interstitial cells of bronchiolar-alveolar regions. No cell populations in air-exposed or carbonyl iron-exposed control animals exhibited more than 1% labeling at any point in time. Immediately after the 5-hour asbestos exposure, incorporation was normal. By 19 hours after exposure there was a significant increase in incorporation of 3HTdR, particularly by Type II epithelial cells of the first alveolar duct bifurcations. The greatest increase in degree of incorporation (up to 18-fold) was observed 24 hours after exposure, and increased percentages of 3HTdR-labeled cells were maintained through the 48 hours postexposure period. Normal labeling was present by 8 days after exposure, and this level remained through the 1-month period studied. This apparent mitogenic response correlates with increased numbers of bronchiolar-alveolar epithelial and interstitial cells demonstrated by ultrastructural morphometry in correlative studies. The authors speculate that the incorporation of 3HTdR could be induced by the direct effects of inhaled fibers or by mitogenic factors released from macrophages attracted to the inhaled asbestos.\r"

Tumor phenotype was demonstrated by enzyme histochemistry. Because monophenotypia is not synonymous with monoclonality, a method to estimate the degree of mingling of the two cellular phenotypes in normal tissue was devised. Twenty-five point three percent of 624 randomly chosen pairs of adjacent follicular cells were of unlike phenotype, suggesting that if tumors were derived from 2 or more cells at least a quarter would express polyphenotypia. Four hundred fifty-three thyroid lesions induced in 20 GPDX (enzyme-deficient) mice, 20 C3H (normal) mice, and 48 heterozygous (C3HxGPDX) mice by radiation and long-term goitrogen treatment were studied. One hundred twenty-eight adenomas (sharply defined or encapsulated hypercellular lesions) were found in heterozygotes; 108 (84%) were monophenotypic, and 20 (16%) were largely monophenotypic with degenerate areas or included normal cells. None were clearly polyphenotypic. Seventy-five nodules (circumscribed but not encapsulated, largely normocellular lesion with prominent stroma) were found in heterozygotes; 25 (33%) only were monophenotypic. It is concluded that thyroid adenomas are monoclonal and nodules polyclonal. The variegated pattern of polyphenotypia in the nodules together with their prominent stromal component leads to the suggestion that there is a causative role for the stroma in their generation.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have observed the rapid reorganization of the cellular membranes of macrophages during Fc receptor-mediated frustrated phagocytosis of immune complex-coated surfaces. As the macrophages spread, large, clear basal vacuoles and anastamosing tubules were formed, occasionally contiguous with the adherent surface. Coated vesicles also were observed. This process was accompanied by a rapid reorganization of the Golgi complex region of the macrophages, which was observed using trimetaphosphatase histochemistry and an antibody to a Golgi membrane antigen as markers. On contact of the macrophages with the immune complexes, the Golgi complexes, which were tightly clustered around the centrioles, dispersed into vesicles and reorganized near the basal surface. The Golgi cisternae swelled, fragmented, and decreased in number. Golgi membrane antigen was found in the large basal vacuoles and also associated with the adherent basal surface of the macrophages. This indicates that the Golgi complexes were reorganized, in part, by a direct recruitment of their membranes to the increasing basal surface area of the spreading macrophages. The changes in the structure of the Golgi complexes were reversible; by 2 hours, the complexes had recovered their normal organization, with an accompanying decrease in the number of large basal vacuoles. These data suggest that the dynamic interrelationship among the Golgi membranes, intracellular vacuoles, and the plasma membrane can be perturbed by membrane spreading on a nonphagocytosable surface.\r"

The leukocyte diapedesis and subsequent tissue migration induced by antigen or compound 48/80 were oriented from the venules towards adjacent arterioles. In contrast, leukocyte emigration induced by a mast cell-independent stimulus, leukotriene B4, did not show preferential orientation towards arterioles. Moreover, mast cells were abundant in the hamster cheek pouch, and they were localized predominantly along arterioles, rather than along venules. Because mast cells are considered to be the source of the chemotactic mediators causing the leukocyte emigration, the periarteriolar mast cell localization may be of functional significance by creating chemotactic gradients between arterioles and venules, thereby promoting oriented and effective interstitial migration of leukocytes. Whether or not a similar mechanism is operative in other species and tissues remains to be established, however, arteriolar predominance of mast cells was observed also in rat calvarial periosteum and in mouse skin.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism whereby cardiotoxic doses of isoproterenol (ISO) induces early permeability alteration of the sarcolemmal membrane is unknown; both beta-receptor overstimulation and direct toxic effect of ISO oxidation products have been implicated. There has been no morphologic observation, furthermore, on the structural basis of permeability alteration during this process. The purpose of the present study was to compare the morphology of cardiocyte injury induced by ISO and oxidized ISO (ISO-O2) and to visualize perturbation of the sarcolemma correlating with the leaky membrane. The authors studied the left ventricular myocardium of rats 10 and 60 minutes after subcutaneous administration of 85 mg/kg ISO and isolated perfused rat hearts exposed for 10 minutes either to ISO or ISO-O2 in a dose of 100 mg/l (10(-4) M) to determine the permeability of the sarcolemmal membrane using the extracellular diffusion tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) by light and thin section electron microscopy, the morphology of the sarcolemmal membrane by means of freeze-fracture electron microscopy, and the density of intramembrane particles (IMP) in the sarcolemmal membrane by planimetry using freeze-fracture electron microscopy. In in vivo rat hearts both 10 and 60 minutes after ISO and in vitro (isolated perfused) rat hearts exposed to either ISO or ISO-O2 for 10 minutes, HRP labeled the sarcoplasm of focally located cardiocytes implicating leakiness of the sarcolemmal membrane. HRP positive cardiocytes (with the exception of the in vivo 10 minute group) showed characteristic features of contraction band necrosis (both on light and thin-section electron microscopy) in all groups. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy of sarcolemmal protoplasmic (P) membrane faces revealed two populations of cardiocytes in all groups. P-membrane faces in one population of cardiocytes appeared as in the control. In the other population of cardiocytes, P-membrane faces showed irregular tears. Planimetry demonstrated a significant decrease of IMP numerical densities in P-membrane faces with tears in the in vivo 10 minute group and both with or without tears in the in vivo 60 minutes group and the in vitro groups compared with the control values. Furthermore, with the exception of the 10 minute in vivo group, IMP densities significantly decreased in sarcolemmal membranes with tears compared with those without tears in all experimental groups. These observations are consistent with the view that catecholamine induced myocardial injury is, at least partly, related to the direct toxic effect of catecholamine oxidation products on the sarcolemmal membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This study tested the effect of repeated injections of IC given at 3-day intervals. After the last of four, six, or nine injections, rats continued to show the same gross and histologic lesions observed in rats injected once with IC. After serial injections, however, the distal small intestine was more severely involved than the proximal intestine. In addition, villous shortening, stromal hemosiderin deposits, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue and mesenteric lymph node sinus hemorrhage and hemosiderin deposits were seen in rats given nine injections. There was a remarkable absence of stromal infiltration of the villi by inflammatory cells. Experiments conducted with 125I-labeled IC plus sufficient \"cold\" IC to induce intestinal lesions showed that IC were deposited at extravascular sites in the gut. The failure of such IC to provoke cellular infiltration in the gut is unexplained.\r"

A comparative histologic and cytogenetic investigation of large series of renal cell carcinomas now shows that purely papillary tumors differ from the more common nonpapillary form not only in their morphologic characteristic, but also in karyotype changes observed. All of the 11 papillary tumors of this study failed to show any rearrangement of the critical 3p segment, and trisomy of the 5q22-qter segment has never been found. The gain of chromosome 17 was detected only in papillary renal cell carcinomas. Other nonrandom karyotype changes occurred with the same incidence in both types of tumor. Thus, some karyotype alterations in renal cell carcinomas could perhaps be regarded as a genetic mechanism responsible for the phenotype of conversed tubular cells.\r"

In this study, the cytotoxicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) was studied in exponentially growing T5-1 human lymphoblastoid cells. MNNG exposure killed cells and inhibited proliferation of the remaining viable cells. Reduction in cell viability, which coincided with the accumulation of cells in the late S phase of the cell cycle, was not apparent until the population had completed one doubling. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of fluorescein diacetate-stained, MNNG-treated cells into live and dead subpopulations revealed that all cycle phases were well represented in the live fraction, whereas the dead fraction consisted primarily of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content. Thus, cell death after MNNG exposure occurred during the second cell cycle after treatment apparently as a consequence of perturbation of DNA replication and the degradation of nuclear DNA.\r"

  ".U": "89116351\r", 
  ".W": "Both alveolar type II cells and Clara cells have been suggested as cells of origin of human bronchioloalveolar lung carcinomas and other pulmonary neoplasms, based on the presence of cell specific markers identified by immunocytochemical methods. Alveolar type II cell origin of solid and papillary lung tumors of the mouse has been demonstrated, and Clara cells have been suggested as cell of origin for hamster pulmonary neoplasms. Therefore, chemically induced bronchiolar hyperplasias and pulmonary neoplasms of Syrian golden hamsters were analyzed by avidin-biotin immunohistochemistry to localize a hamster-specific Clara cell antigen (CCA) and keratin. The hamsters had been treated subcutaneously with multiple doses of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA). Proliferative lesions of low cuboidal, tall columnar, or pleomorphic cells were present within bronchioles or adjacent to airways in the alveolar parenchyma. Frequently areas of squamous cell differentiation were present focally or diffusely that were immunoreactive for cytokeratin. Immunoreactivity for cytokeratin was also noted for hyperplastic bronchiolar neuroepithelial bodies. Cellular hyperplasias extending out into the alveolar parenchyma contained ciliated cells and frequently consisted of cells immunoreactive for CCA, showing them to be of bronchiolar Clara cell origin. Tumors developed from bronchiolar cell hyperplasias localized within bronchioles and from bronchiolar cells lining former alveolar walls. Neoplastic growth patterns were tubulo-papillary, forming loose networks or densely cellular areas. Immunoreactivity for cytoplasmic CCA was found in 50% of the tumors and was seen most frequently in small cuboidal cells and larger, vacuolated cells scattered throughout the neoplasms. In summary, evidence is presented that NDEA-induced pulmonary tumors of the Syrian golden hamster originated from cells lining bronchioles and from extrabronchiolar Clara cell hyperplasias of the terminal bronchioles. As the pulmonary tumors of the hamsters progressed towards a squamoid cell type, CCA was no longer detectable but cells became immunoreactive for keratin.\r"

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were pretreated with pronase and stained with a K19-specific antibody by the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. In nonkeratinized mucosa, whether normal or benign hyperplastic, K19 was detectable in the basal cell layer. In keratinized mucosa, whether normal or benign hyperplastic, there was no detectable K19. All lesions from any oral site that exhibited atypia diagnosed from hematoxylin and eosin stained sections as moderate-to-severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ, whether hyperkeratotic or not, stained strongly for K19 in the basal and suprabasal cell layers. The number of cell layers that were K19-positive correlated with the level in the epithelium to which dysplasia persisted. Suprabasal K19 staining tended to occur in regions of the epithelium in which expression of the terminal differentiation protein involucrin was delayed or absent. Thus, K19 expression may be linked to the retention of stem cell character or a state otherwise uncommitted to terminal squamous differentiation. Suprabasal K19 staining is clearly correlated with premalignant change in oral epithelium and therefore promises to be a useful tool in oral histopathologic diagnosis.\r"

These tracheas were then sealed and transplanted subcutaneously into irradiated athymic nude mice. Four weeks after transplantation the tracheal lumen was completely covered by epithelium, most of which was of mucociliary respiratory type. At this stage, tracheal transplants containing tracheobronchial epithelium from 20 different donors were exposed to silastic devices containing 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg paraformaldehyde. The tracheal transplants were examined histologically at 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks after transplantation. Before sacrifice, all animals were injected with a single pulse of tritiated thymidine. Important epithelial alterations could be seen in the formaldehyde treated transplants with a maximum effect visible at 2 weeks after exposure. The highest dose of 2 mg produced, in most cases, numerous areas of epithelial erosion and inflammation whereas this effect was not as evident with the lower doses. All doses produced areas of hyperplastic epithelium alternating with areas of pleomorphic-atrophic epithelium. Although the differences in predominance of different types of epithelium was not clearly dose-dependent, the labeling index (LI) showed dose dependence between 2 and 4 weeks after initiation of exposure. The maximum mean LI was three to four times higher than normal, although in some focal hyperplastic-metaplastic lesions the LI was increased up to 20 times. These studies show that formaldehyde, although toxic at higher doses, is able to elicit at lower doses a proliferative response of the human respiratory epithelium that is not preceded by a massive toxic effect. This response is similar, although less intense than that of the rat respiratory epithelium in which formaldehyde proved to be a carcinogen.\r"

  ".W": "In the absence of the antismoking campaign, adult per capita cigarette consumption in 1987 would have been an estimated 79-89 per cent higher than the level actually experienced. The smoking prevalence of all birth cohorts of men and women born during this century is well below that which would have been expected in the absence of the campaign. As a consequence, in 1985 an estimated 56 million Americans were smokers; without the campaign, an estimated 91 million would have been smokers. As a result of campaign-induced decisions not to smoke, between 1964 and 1985 an estimated 789,200 Americans avoided or postponed smoking-related deaths and gained an average of 21 additional years of life expectancy each; collectively this represents more than 16 million person-years of additional life. The greatest health benefit lies in the future, however, as younger individuals reach the ages at which smoking claims its greatest toll, and as middle-aged former smokers realize relative reductions in smoking mortality risks as a result of long-term abstinence from smoking. For example, campaign-induced decisions not to smoke made prior to 1986 will result in the postponement or avoidance of an estimated 2.1 million smoking-related deaths between 1986 and the year 2000.\r"

  ".U": "89116366\r", 
  ".W": "Data on smoking prevalence since 1974 are presented for the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Norway and Sweden. During this period, sex-specific prevalence has decreased in all the countries studied, with the exception of Norway, where women showed an increase. There was also a considerable decline in uptake of smoking by the young over this period, suggesting that the observed decline in prevalence is likely to continue. In the United States, the rate of decline in adult smoking prevalence has been linear. This linear pattern is probably similar in prevalence in most other countries studied, with the notable exception of Australia, which demonstrated no change for the majority of the period. Among the six countries studied, the United States had neither the lowest smoking prevalence nor the fastest rate of decline over the period. Differential patterns of change infer that the successful public health interventions in some countries are not being applied in others. While the lack of change in Australia prior to 1983 is surprising, this was followed by a sizable drop in smoking prevalence for both higher and lower educational groups in conjunction with the introduction of mass media-led antismoking campaigns. Most of the other countries report an ever increasing gap in prevalence between higher and lower educational groups. These findings suggest that all countries might benefit from a greater exchange of antismoking ideas and public health action.\r"

  ".W": "To further define the relation between smoking and vitamin C status, the dietary and serum vitamin C levels of 11,592 respondents in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) were analyzed. Smokers of 20 cigarettes daily had the lowest vitamin C dietary intake (79 mg, 95% CI:73, 84) and serum levels (0.82 mg/dl, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.86; 46.6 mumol/L, 95% CI: 43.7, 48.8), while smokers of 1-19 cigarettes daily had decreased vitamin C intake (97 mg; 95% CI: 90, 104 mg) and serum levels (0.97 mg/dl, 95% CI: 0.92, 1.03; 55.1 mumol/L, 95% CI: 52.2, 58.5) compared to respondents who had never smoked (109 mg, 95% CI: 105, 113 and 1.15 mg/dl, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.18; 65.3 mumol/L, 95% CI: 63.0, 67.0, respectively). This inverse association between both intake and serum levels of vitamin C and smoking was independent of age, sex, body weight, race, and alcoholic beverage consumption. Following further adjustment for dietary vitamin C intake, the negative correlation between cigarette smoking and serum vitamin C levels persisted. The risk of severe hypovitaminosis C (serum levels less than or equal to 0.2 mg/dl; 11.4 mumol/L) was increased in smokers, particularly when not accompanied by vitamin supplementation (odds ratio 3.0, 95% CI: 2.5, 3.6). These data suggest that even though smoking adversely affects preferences for vitamin C rich foods, the inverse association between smoking and serum vitamin C levels occurs independently of dietary intake.\r"

Death rates were calculated using an estimate of the person-years at risk. Adjusted for age, marital status, education, and quality of housing, the estimated relative risks of death from all causes were 1.17 (approximate 95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.36) for men and 1.15 (1.06, 1.24) for women with passive exposure. These relative risks were similar to those for ex-smokers and for pipe or cigar smokers. Risks increased slightly with level of exposure. The relative risk from passive smoking was greatest for men under age 50 (RR = 2.09, 1.31-3.34). Risks from passive smoking were slightly elevated for several causes among men and women, and may be broader than those previously reported. On the other hand, these small nonspecific increases in death rates may reflect other characteristics of passive smokers that increase mortality.\r"

Saliva cotinine concentrations in girls who were smokers throughout the three years increased over each year of the study, the greatest increase occurring during movement from occasional to daily smoking. Cigarette consumption also increased over the two years. For a group of continuing daily smokers (n = 23), inhalation of smoke per cigarette as indexed by the ratio of cotinine concentration to average daily cigarette consumption did not change over time. Cotinine concentrations in 16 girls who were smoking on a daily basis within a year of starting to smoke suggested the early development of inhalation. Our findings suggest that young smokers learn to inhale cigarette smoke very early in their smoking careers, that further increases in smoke intake mainly reflect increased cigarette consumption, and that the pharmacological effects of nicotine are already important in reinforcing their smoking.\r"

Forty per cent of 2,958 age-eligible policyholders for whom current addresses were available returned a completed questionnaire. Population estimates for smoking status agree closely with national estimates for Blacks age 21-60 years: 50 per cent never-smokers; 36 per cent current smokers; 14 per cent ex-smokers. Current and ex-smokers reported a modal low-rate/high nicotine menthol smoking pattern. Current smokers reported a mean of 3.8 serious quit attempts, a strong desire and intention to quit smoking, and limited past use of effective quit smoking treatments and self-help resources. Correlates of motivation to quit smoking were similar to those found among smokers in the general population, including smoking-related illnesses and medical advice to quit smoking, previous quit attempts, beliefs in smoking-related health harms/quitting benefits, and expected social support for quitting. Methodological limitations and implications for the design of needed Black-focused quit smoking initiatives are discussed.\r"

The population (n = 242) consisted of a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse group of pregnant women enrolled in a large health maintenance organization (HMO) who reported they were smoking at the time of their first prenatal visit. Biochemical confirmation of continuous abstinence achieved prior to the 20th completed week of pregnancy and lasting through delivery revealed 22.2 per cent of the women in the eight-week serialized program quit versus 8.6 per cent of controls with usual care. The adjusted odds ratio was 2.80 (95 per cent CI = 1.17, 6.69). We conclude that a low-cost prenatal self-help intervention can significantly affect the public health problem of smoking during pregnancy and its associated risks for maternal and child health.\r"

The mean increase in cpd for lung cancer cases was about twice that of controls. Using switchers who did not increase cpd as the referent group, there was a linear dose-response relationship between the odds of lung cancer and increasing level of compensation. The odds ratio increased from 1.19 to 2.37 in males and from 1.66 to 3.83 in females corresponding to increases of 1-10 to 21+ cpd after switching. Findings from this study suggest that increasing cpd after switching to filter cigarettes is an important risk factor for lung cancer that needs to be emphasized in epidemiologic studies. Proponents of the idea that switching cigarettes is of some benefit, should also advocate that individuals who continue smoking should avoid compensation after switching.\r"

Effectiveness of policy implementation was also evaluated. Results indicated that the policy was well-publicized and was approved by virtually all the non-smokers and the majority of the smokers. Following implementation, employees in the smoking policy hospital were less likely to report being bothered by smoke at their work stations than were employees of the comparison hospital. Six months and one year after the policy change, smokers reported lower smoking rates while at work, although quit smoking rates and home smoking rates were similar in both hospitals.\r"

Conflictual relations between social forces are illustrated by two examples involving the introduction of safety representatives in the workplace, and compensation for occupational lung disease.

Nine additional patients in each anesthetic group received 250 micrograms/kg mivacurium. Three of the 18 patients given 250 micrograms/kg mivacurium developed cutaneous flushing; in one of these mean arterial pressure decreased 32% for less than 1 minute; no significant changes in heart rate occurred. With the increase in mivacurium dose from 120 micrograms/kg to 250 micrograms/kg the times to onset of 90% and maximum neuromuscular block decreased by 0.5 to 1 minute, and the times to recovery of neuromuscular transmission to 5% (T5) or 25% (T25) increased by 2-4 minutes. The recovery index (T25-75) in patients anesthetized with halothane was 4.3 +/- 1.5 minute (mean +/- SD); the time to complete recovery (T4:1 greater than or equal to 0.75) was 19.8 +/- 7.4 minutes.\r"

  ".W": "This study determined the priming dose of vecuronium (V), pancuronium (P) and atracurium (A) that resulted in the most rapid onset of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) in 150 patients given either V 0.08 mg/kg, P 0.1 mg/kg or A 0.6 mg/kg. Patients were further divided (n = 10 per group) to receive no prime or 5%, 10%, 15% or 20% of the total dose as a prime followed 5-7 minutes later by the remaining (intubating) dose. A further 10 patients received 0.04 mg/kg d-tubocurarine followed by 1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine (S). Priming significantly shortened the onset of NMB. The priming doses producing the most rapid onset were 0.012 mg/kg for V, 0.015 mg/kg for P and 0.09 mg/kg for A. The S resulted in significantly greater NMB at 60 sec than any priming dose of A, V or P. There was no difference between the three nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers in shortening the onset of NMB produced by priming. To evaluate both the effect of the \"optimal\" priming dose in awake patients and the effect of increasing intubating doses on NMB an additional 40 patients were given V 0.012 mg/kg followed by V 0.08, 0.1, 0.12 or 0.15 mg/kg. Increasing the intubating dose did not improve onset of NMB. The \"optimal\" priming dose, however, resulted in a high incidence of symptoms of muscle weakness. We conclude that priming shortens the onset of NMB similarly between V, P and A but the priming dose producing the most rapid onset of NMB also results in a high incidence of side effects and therefore the priming principle should be used with caution.\r"

The patients were randomized in a double blind fashion to receive either a cutaneous scopolamine patch or a visually identical cutaneous placebo patch. Postoperative analgesia was provided solely with epidural morphine. Nausea was treated with metoclopramide and droperidol. At 24 hours postoperatively, the mean nausea score was significantly lower with scopolamine than with placebo (1 +/- 2 vs 51 +/- 42, respectively, P less than 0.05). The number of patients reporting \"zero nausea\" was significantly greater with scopolamine patches than with placebo patches (13 vs 1, P less than 0.01). The mean number of times antiemetic drugs were administered per patient was lower with scopolamine than with placebo patches (0.2 +/- 0.4 vs 2.8 +/- 2.6, P less than 0.05).

In contrast, swine given I-653 had no detectable elevation in plasma fluoride concentration immediately after anesthesia, but a 17% (P less than 0.05) increase in plasma fluoride ion concentration 4 hours after anesthesia.

The patients were scheduled for partial laminectomy for a herniated lumbar disc. A complete examination was possible in eight subjects. The extent of view was very limited. The epidural space opened up only temporarily as air was injected. The dura mater lay very close to the dorsal aspect of the epidural space and was attached to the flaval ligaments by a dorsomedian connective tissue band. The band was identified in all eight subjects and was found to cause a dorsal fold in the dura mater. An epidural catheter was introduced 2-5 cm into the space by midline puncture in four patients and by the paramedian approach in the other four. The catheter was visualized in two patients only when the paramedian approach was used. None of the midline catheters could be seen in the space. In 2 of the 10 subjects a moderate bleeding impaired the view and made complete examination impossible. Smaller bleeding occurred in three other subjects. The partial laminectomy performed one to two interspaces caudad to the level of endoscopy did not reveal any evidence of epidural bleeding in any subject. The postoperative course of all patients was uneventful.\r"

In 94% of the patients, the blocks were performed under light general anesthesia. Standard IM or short-beveled needles were used in all. Four anesthetic solutions of lidocaine and/or bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine were injected in volumes ranging from 0.5 to 1.25 ml/kg. The overall success rate of caudal blocks was 96%, but several attempts were necessary in 25% of patients. Most failures occurred in children more than 7 years old. The use of short-beveled needles considerably decreased the number of traumatic punctures. The upper limit of analgesia varied widely and appropriate distribution of anesthesia was reliably obtained only after the injection of 0.75 to 1.0 ml/kg of local anesthetic solution. Conscious children tolerated surgery poorly (from a psychological point of view) although they were free of pain. Conversely, breathing difficulties occurred in 12% of lightly anesthetized patients. Hemodynamic disturbances were infrequent, as were adverse effects except for postoperative vomiting (17%). Motor block, present in 54% of patients, was poorly tolerated postoperatively by 10% of patients. Long-lasting postoperative pain relief was usually obtained. There were no major complications or neurological sequelae and good patient and parental acceptance of caudal anesthesia. Caudal anesthesia is a reliable and safe technique in young children.\r"

The concentration of lidocaine tended to rise more rapidly and to achieve higher levels in the first 10 minutes following injection of the carbonated lidocaine. However, no significant differences were found in the parameters of Cmax, Tmax or AUC for the two salts, and the serum levels in both groups at all times were well below the levels known to produce systemic toxicity. Therefore, while previous studies appear to indicate that the carbonate salt enhances diffusion, penetration, and uptake of neural tissues as compared with the hydrochloride salt, the present study indicates that vascular uptake is not similarly affected.\r"

Patients received one of five primary techniques: high-dose fentanyl (greater than 50 micrograms/kg), moderate-dose fentanyl (less than 50 micrograms/kg), sufentanil (3-8 micrograms/kg), diazepam (0.4-1 mg/kg) with ketamine (3-6 mg/kg) or halothane (0.5-2.5% inspired concentration after thiopental induction). Supplemental inhalation anesthesia (enflurane, halothane, or isoflurane) was used in 60% of cases where the primary technique was intravenous based. Patients in the above anesthetic groupings had similar perioperative demographic and risk classifications. The overall incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction, postoperative low cardiac output state, and in-hospital death were 4.1, 5.6, and 3.1%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the incidence of these occurrences or in the incidence of serious pulmonary, renal, or neurologic morbidity or length of ICU stay among primary anesthetic techniques nor among supplemental inhalation agent groups. Multivariate discriminant analysis of this data suggests that a multitude of factors are significantly more important than anesthetic technique as determinants of outcome after coronary artery surgery.\r"

However, no prospective studies have determined whether PAC improves outcome in higher risk patients compared with that following central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring alone. The authors prospectively examined the incidence of and factors related to perioperative morbidity and mortality in 1094 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery surgery managed with elective PAC (n = 537) or with CVP (n = 557). Perioperative risk factors and demographics that predict morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery were used to quantify risk classification. Outcome was judged by length of ICU stay, occurrence of postoperative myocardial infarction, in-hospital death, major hemodynamic aberrations, and significant noncardiac systemic complications. No significant differences in any outcome variables were noted in any group of patients with similar quantitative risk classification managed with or without PAC, including those in the highest risk class. In addition, there were no significant differences in outcome among the 39 patients who would have been managed with CVP monitoring only, but who subsequently developed a clinical need for PAC based on the occurrence of serious hemodynamic events compared to patients who had PAC performed electively. This study suggests that PAC does not play a major role in influencing outcome after cardiac surgery, that even high-risk cardiac surgical patients may be safely managed without routine PAC, and that delaying PAC until a clinical need develops does not significantly alter outcome, but may have an important impact on cost savings.\r"

Three groups of patients were studied: infants (1-12 mo old, n = 14), children (1-5 yr old, n = 14), and adults (23-38 yr old, n = 13). Skin-surface PCO2 was measured to determine the peak PCO2 occurring at the end of anesthesia when end-tidal N2O concentration was less than 6%. Naloxone was administered if PCO2 exceeded 70 mmHg. During recovery from anesthesia, ventilatory pattern was recorded using impedance pneumography to determine the longest breath-to-breath interval and the number of episodes of central apnea (defined as breath-to-breath intervals greater than or equal to 10 s in infants and children and greater than or equal to 20 s in adults). Elevation of PCO2 correlated with increasing plasma fentanyl concentrations but did not differ between groups. Four patients (two infants, one child, and one adult) required naloxone. The only subject who had a low plasma fentanyl concentration but required naloxone was a 6-wk-old infant; this was the only subject younger than 3 mo. For each range of fentanyl concentrations, the incidence of apnea increased with age, as did the number of episodes of apnea per subject. Fentanyl-induced ventilatory depression, as assessed by elevation of resting PCO2 during emergence from anesthesia and disruption of ventilatory pattern during recovery from anesthesia, is not greater in infants older than 3 mo than in children and adults.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of lumbar intrathecal fentanyl on reported pain, nociceptive flexor withdrawal reflexes, a monosynaptic motor arc (H-reflex), and supraspinal effects such as miosis, nausea, respiratory depression was evaluated. In five of eight subjects the flexor withdrawal reflex was completely abolished within 15 min. In the others the reflex was significantly depressed from control values. Decreases in reported pain paralleled the decrease in the flexor reflex, H-reflexes remained unchanged, and no supraspinal side effects were observed. It is likely that these selective changes observed were from the isolated effect of fentanyl modulating nociception at the spinal cord level.\r"

Neuromuscular response was evaluated by recording the force of contraction of the adductor of the thumb during train-of-four stimulation at 0.1 Hz. The children were divided into two groups. Patients in group A (n = 45) were anesthetized with N2O:O2 and halothane (1% inspired) and patients in group B (n = 45) were anesthetized with N2O:O2 and fentanyl or morphine. Each group was further divided into five subgroups of nine children. Children in the first three sets of subgroups (A1-A3, B1-B3) received an initial dose of 0.02, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06 or 0.07 mg/kg mivacurium to determine dose response relationships under the different anesthetic regimens. The ED50 and ED95 neuromuscular blocking doses calculated from this single dose technique were 0.051 mg/kg and 0.095 mg/kg, respectively, in children anesthetized with halothane N2O:O2, and 0.059 mg/kg and 0.11 mg/kg in children anesthetized with N2O:O2 narcotic. The fourth subset of each group (A4 and B4) received 0.09 mg/kg and 0.11 mg/kg mivacurium, the estimated ED95 for each respectively. The last subsets (A5 and B5) received 0.2 mg/kg.

The study was performed on nine adults (mean age, 29.2 yr) who were awake and conscious without peripheral neurologic deficits at the time of surgery. The study was conducted with the dura open with the use of a radial artery cannula, a 7-Fr thermodilution flow-directed pulmonary artery catheter, and an internal jugular vein catheter. The 133xenon intraarterial injection technique was used to determine regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the nonoperated hemisphere. rCBF remained unchanged (from 22.8 +/- 4.1 ml.100 g-1.min-1 to 23.8 +/- 4.6 ml.100 g-1.min-1) during the hypotensive period (MAP from 87.8 +/- 10.4 mmHg to 40.0 +/- 4.4 mmHg; P less than 0.001) despite an increase in cardiac index since cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebrovascular resistance decreased to a similar degree. No gross cerebral metabolic disturbances were observed. A period of decreased cerebrovascular resistance and increased rCBF followed induced hypotension. rCBF increased from 23.8 +/- 4.6 ml.100 g-1.min-1 to 30.0 +/- 5.8 ml.100 g-1.min-1 (P less than 0.001) 20 min after sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was stopped without rebound hypertension. These modifications disappeared 20 min later. Reduction of mean arterial blood pressure to 40 mmHg by SNP was apparently safe for the brain, although the possibility of low perfused regions and local brain and cerebrospinal fluid lactoacidosis, particularly in the retracted hemisphere, cannot be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "Protamine given to neutralize heparin after extracorporeal circulation can trigger a catastrophic reaction in some patients. While searching for a biochemical basis for this reaction, protamine was tested as an inhibitor of human plasma carboxypeptidase N (CPN) or kininase I, the inactivator of anaphylatoxins and kinins. Human plasma and CPN purified from human plasma, (Mr = 280 K) or its isolated active subunit (Mr = 48 K) were the sources of enzyme. The hydrolysis of furylacryloyl (FA)-Ala-Lys was measured in a UV spectrophotometer and that of bradykinin and the synthetic C-terminal octapeptide of anaphylatoxin C3a (C3a8) by high performance liquid chromatography. Protamine inhibited the hydrolysis of FA-Ala-Lys by CPN, (IC50 = 3.2 X 10(-7) M); added human serum albumin (30 mg/ml) increased the IC50 to 7 X 10(-6) M. When plasma was the source of CPN, the IC50 was 2 X 10(-6) M. Protamine more effectively inhibited the hydrolysis of bradykinin and C3a8. The IC50 for protamine was 5 X 10(-8) M with CPN and bradykinin, 7 X 10(-8) M with CPN and C3a8 and with the 48 K subunit and bradykinin it was 7 X 10(-8) M of protamine. Heparin competes with CPN for protamine, because in high concentration (18 U/ml) it reverses the inhibition by protamine. Protamine did not inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) or the endopeptidase 24.11 (enkephalinase). Kinetic studies showed the mechanism of protamine inhibition to be partially competitive; about 10-20% of the hydrolysis of bradykinin by CPN was not inhibited by protamine. Thus, by blocking the inactivation of mediators released in shock, protamine inhibition of CPN may be partially responsible for the catastrophic reaction observed to occur in some patients.\r"

For CBF1 MAP was 89 +/- 3 mmHg (mean +/- SEM, n = 9) with PaCO2 44 +/- 1 mmHg. For CBF2 following graded hemorrhage MAP was 48 +/- 2 mmHg and PaCO2 43 +/- 1 mmHg. For CBF3 MAP was 93 +/- 2 and PaCO2 45 +/- 1 mmHg, following infusion of phenylephrine (PE) at 13.9 +/- 4.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Total CBF1 was 1.84 +/- 0.18 ml.g-1.min-1, tCBF2 1.32 +/- 0.09 ml.g-1.min-1 (P less than 0.05 vs. tCBF1) and tCBF3 2.60 +/- 0.18 (P less than 0.05 vs. tCBF1 and 2). For tCBF3 hemoglobin concentration had decreased 23% from 14.2 +/- 0.2 g.100 ml-1 to 11.0 +/- 0.5 g.100 ml-1 (P less than 0.05). Regional CBF decreased significantly in seven of 12 regions examined from CBF1 to CBF2 and was significantly higher in all regions for CBF3. For CBF1-3 infratentorial blood flows (cerebellar and brain stem) were significantly higher than flows to the supratentorial structures (cerebral cortical and basal ganglia). During isoflurane anesthesia, phenylephrine infused to support MAP following hemorrhagic hypotension effectively maintains rCBF and tCBF. There is no indication that phenylephrine infused to increase MAP following hemorrhage results in cerebral vasoconstriction in rats anesthetized with isoflurane.\r"

  ".W": "Direct myocardial depression plays a role in the cardiovascular toxicity of local anesthetic agents, but this role is obscured by concomitant cardiac, systemic, and CNS events: seizures, hypoxia, acidosis, sympathetic activation, bradycardia, and A-V heart block. Direct injection of small bolus doses of lidocaine and bupivacaine into a branch of the left coronary artery was used to minimize these systemic effects. Regional contraction in the zone supplied by the coronary artery was measured with a sonomicrometer. Both agents caused a dose-dependent reduction in the extent of systolic contraction, and a 4.9:1 (lidocaine:bupivacaine) dose ratio produced a 50% depression of contraction. The duration of depression, taken as the time for 95% recovery of systolic contraction, was about 25% (P less than 0.05) longer with bupivacaine for an equal degree of depression. Coronary blood flow was reduced modestly by both agents. These results suggest that differences in the magnitude or duration of direct myocardial depression cannot explain the clinical perception that the cardiovascular toxicity of bupivacaine is greater than that of lidocaine.\r"

  ".W": "I653 is a new inhalation anesthetic having especially desirable recovery characteristics because of its very low blood and tissue solubility. Investigations of its cardiovascular and electroencephalographic effects have revealed actions similar to those of isoflurane. However, these studies did not evaluate the potential of I653 to predispose the heart to epinephrine-induced arrhythmias. In this investigation, we studied eight domestic swine to compare the effects of I653 with those of other anesthetics on the cardiac arrhythmogenic actions of intravenously infused epinephrine. I653, isoflurane, and halothane each were given, on separate days, at 0.7-0.8 and at 1.1-1.2 MAC. The rate of infusion of epinephrine needed to produce premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) when the animals were anesthetized with I653 (6.9 +/- 0.7 and 6.6 +/- 0.9 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 at 0.8 and 1.2 MAC) did not differ from that during isoflurane anesthesia (5.7 +/- 1.1 and 6.0 +/- 1.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 at 0.7 and 1.1 MAC), but was greater than that required during halothane anesthesia (1.3 +/- 0.2 and 1.1 +/- 0.3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 at 0.7 and 1.1 MAC). Similar mean arterial blood pressures and heart rates resulted from like infusions of epinephrine during I653 and isoflurane anesthesia. PVCs occurred at lesser infusion rates of epinephrine and at lower mean arterial blood pressures and heart rates with halothane than with I653 or isoflurane. Anesthetic concentration, over the range studied, did not alter the infusion rate of epinephrine required to produce arrhythmias with any anesthetic. The authors conclude that I-653 and isoflurane have similar properties with respect to epinephrine-induced arrhythmias and increases in heart rate and arterial blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of intravenously administered 2-chloroprocaine upon uterine artery blood flow velocity (UBFV) in gravid guinea pigs. Ten experiments were performed in ten chronically instrumented animals between 0.7 and 0.9 of timed gestation. Each animal received four solutions of 2-chloroprocaine in random order: 1) 0.67 mg/kg; 2) 1.34 mg/kg; 3) 2.0 mg/kg; and 4) 1.34 mg/kg, with epinephrine 0.2 microgram/kg. Six animals received a fifth solution, 0.2 ml of saline control. 2-Chloroprocaine 1.34 mg/kg significantly increased maternal mean arterial pressure (MMAP) at 30 s after injection, and 2-chloroprocaine 2.0 mg/kg significantly increased MMAP through 2 min. 2-Chloroprocaine 1.34 mg/kg, with epinephrine 0.2 microgram/kg, also significantly increased MMAP through 2 min. No other solution significantly altered MMAP. 2-Chloroprocaine 2.0 mg/kg significantly decreased UBFV at 30 s after injection. 2-Chloroprocaine 1.34 mg/kg, with epinephrine 0.2 microgram/kg, significantly decreased UBFV through 2 min. No other solution significantly altered UBFV. The authors conclude that iv administration of 2-chloroprocaine with epinephrine significantly decreased UBFV in pregnant guinea pigs. In contrast, only the largest dose (i.e., 2.0 mg/kg) of 2-chloroprocaine alone transiently decreased UBFV. These data suggest that, in doses up to 1.34 mg/kg, 2-chloroprocaine alone may not decrease uterine blood flow when used as a marker for intravenous injection in obstetric patients.\r"

  ".W": "The study was undertaken to examine if endogenous opioid systems mediate the response of the sympathetic nervous system to halothane anesthesia. Steady state values of renal sympathetic nerve activity (rSNA), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were continuously recorded in the conscious state and at three depths of halothane anesthesia (0.6%, 1.2%, and 2.4%) in rats. Halothane caused an inhibition of rSNA and hypotension and a decrease in HR at the three halothane concentrations. Repeated bolus doses of the opiate antagonist (-)naloxone given iv during 1.2% halothane anesthesia did not significantly increase any of the variables. However, pretreatment with (-)naloxone (2 or 15 mg.kg-1) induced an increase in rSNA at 0.6% halothane, and subsequently the rSNA inhibition was less pronounced at the two higher halothane concentrations compared with control. HR showed a similar pattern, whereas the hypotension was essentially unaffected. Pretreatment with the pharmacologically inactive compound (+)naloxone had no effect on the halothane-induced depression of rSNA. The ED50 halothane concentration concerning nociceptive aversive behavior was not significantly changed with (-)naloxone pretreatment (2 mg.kg-1). In order to determine if sympathoinhibitory bulbospinal serotonin pathways are activated during halothane anesthesia, rSNA, MAP, and HR were recorded in rats pretreated with the serotonin synthesis inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA). However, PCPA pretreatment did not affect the rSNA response to halothane compared with control. These findings indicate that the halothane-induced inhibition of rSNA might partially result from a stereospecific activation of opioid receptors, whereas halothane analgesia does not seem to be mediated by opioid mechanisms.\r"

Five minutes after administration of one of these solutions, they began an infusion of bupivacaine at 2 mg.kg-1.min-1. The bupivacaine infusion was continued until cardiovascular collapse. They then attempted to resuscitate the animals via open chest cardiac massage and a standard resuscitation protocol. Premedication with midazolam or diazepam significantly delayed the onset of ventricular dysrhythmias (P less than 0.05), decreased the incidence of seizures (P less than 0.05), and prevented the increase in blood pressure and heart rate following bupivacaine infusion (P less than 0.05). Benzodiazepine premedication did not affect the dose of bupivacaine or the blood concentration required to produce cardiovascular collapse. The ability to resuscitate animals premedicated with midazolam did not differ from control; however, significantly fewer animals premedicated with diazepam were resuscitated (P less than 0.05). A clinically relevant observation was that almost all animals premedicated with a benzodiazepine progressed directly to cardiovascular collapse without first manifesting seizures.\r"

The so-called debrisoquin hydroxylase, which is defective in approximately 5-10% of whites, is known to be of major importance for the metabolism of several drugs. The possible relation of this isozyme to the metabolism of narcotics eliminated by oxidative biotransformation has not been studied. Several narcotics were screened for in vitro interaction with this P-450 isozyme. This was accomplished by testing for competitive inhibition by narcotics of the 2-hydroxylation of desmethylimipramine in a human liver microsomal preparation. Alfentanil, fentanyl, and dextropropoxyphene were found to competitively inhibit this pathway demonstrating an interaction with this polymorphic isozyme. No interaction was found for codeine, meperidine, methadone, morphine, or nalbuphine. These results suggest that a genetic defect may be important for elimination clearance by metabolism for dextropropoxyphene, alfentanil, and fentanyl and that in vivo investigation is warranted.\r"

Adjustments of ventilation during the different measurements were a PEEP of 5 cmH2O, respiratory rates of 10/min and 5/min, and tidal volumes of 1,000 and 500 ml, respectively. The alarm time measured with a stopwatch was the time that elapsed between disconnection and the acoustical alarm. The circuit was always disconnected at the y-piece when the reservoir bag had been fully expanded after an inspiration. With various fresh flow rates and oxygen concentrations ranging from 33% to 52%, disconnection always was evident within 30 s. Measurement of the oxygen concentration with an alarm time of 30 s after disconnection may be an effective backing system for detecting a disconnection.\r"

  ".W": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is frequently used for maintenance of anesthesia in research animals because of its minimal effect upon circulatory variables and the ability to rapidly alter its anesthetic concentration. However, N2O's low anesthetic potency may result in inadequate levels of anesthesia under experimental conditions; thus, the ability of N2O to provide adequate anesthesia during tracheal stimulation in rats, following withdrawal of halothane was evaluated. Twenty rats of similar ages and weights were anesthetized with halothane (1.44% inspired) and their tracheas orally intubated. Ten minutes prior to the conclusion of a 90-min halothane stabilization period, either 70% N2O (n = 10) or 70% nitrogen (n = 10) was added to the inspired anesthetic gas mixture. The halothane was discontinued at the conclusion of the 90-min period and each rat was observed for spontaneous motor behavior while end-expiratory anesthetic gases were intermittently measured with mass spectrometry. The halothane concentrations present at the times of four specific, consistently occurring behaviors were measured, and comparisons were made between the N2O and nitrogen groups by a mean t test. There were no significant differences (P less than 0.05) in the halothane concentration between the N2O and nitrogen groups in three of the four behaviors compared: 1) change in respiratory pattern, 2) purposeful movement of the torso, and 3) purposeful self-extubation. In the fourth behavior (purposeful movement of an extremity) the halothane concentration was higher in the N2O group than in the nitrogen group. A mean halothane concentration of 0.49% was required to prevent the purposeful behaviors in the presence of N2O.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The amount of emphysema was assessed by the panel method (emphysema grade, EG) and measurement of the mean linear intercept (Lm). The DI depends on three components--alveolar wall/duct disruption, DId; alveolar fibrosis, DIf; and classic emphysema, DIe. DIf was a minor component in our series. The mean DI was 5.8 +/- 2.5, 10.9 +/- 3.9, and 55.7 +/- 7.0% (+/- 1 SEM) in the nonemphysematous (panel grade EG = 0), mild (0 less than EG less than or equal to 25), and moderate to severe (30 less than or equal to EG less than or equal to 60) emphysematous lungs, respectively. The increase in the DI in mild emphysema did not reach significant levels (p less than 0.2). The mean DId was 5.6 +/- 2.5, 10.0 +/- 4.0, and 12.8 +/- 3.9% in the above categories, and the DId in mild emphysema did not differ significantly from that of the nonemphysematous lungs. Lm showed a similar trend and alveolar disruption did not precede airspace enlargement, rather both changes appeared to advance in parallel. The DI correlated closely with EG (r = 0.83, p less than 0.01), but this was due to the component of DIe. The DIe increased steeply in the lungs with EG greater than or equal to 30.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The surfactant-saturated phosphatidylcholine pool in the alveolar wash was 13 +/- 4 mumol/kg and did not change from 10 min to 24 h after birth. Trace amounts of labeled natural sheep surfactant were mixed with fetal lung fluid at birth. By 24 h, 80% of the label had become lung-tissue-associated, yet there was no loss of label from phosphatidylcholine in the lungs when calculated as the sum of the lung tissue plus alveolar wash. De novo synthesized phosphatidylcholine was labeled with choline given by intravascular injection at 1 h of age. Labeled phosphatidylcholine accumulated in the lung tissue linearly to 24 h, and the labeled phosphatidylcholine moved through lamellar body to alveolar pools. The turnover time for alveolar phosphatidylcholine was estimated to be about 13 h, indicating an active metabolic pool. A less surface-active surfactant fraction recovered as a supernatant after centrifugation of the alveolar washes at 40,000 x g increased from birth to 10 min of ventilation, but no subsequent changes in the distribution of surfactant phosphatidylcholine in surfactant fractions occurred. The results were consistent with recycling pathway(s) that maintained surface-active surfactant pools in preterm ventilated lambs.\r"

  ".W": "Proliferation of alveolar type II cells after lung injury is important for the restoration of the alveolar epithelium. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) may represent an important source of growth factors for alveolar type II cells. To test this possibility, BALF fluid was collected from normal rats, concentrated 10-fold by Amicon filtration, and tested for its ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in rat alveolar type II cells in primary culture. BALF induced a dose-dependent increase in type II cell DNA synthesis resulting in a 6-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Similar doses also stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into rat lung fibroblasts by 6- to 8-fold. Removal of pulmonary surface active material by centrifugation did not significantly reduce the stimulatory activity of BALF for type II cells. The stimulation of type II cell DNA synthesis by BALF was reduced by 100% after heating at 100 degrees C for 10 min, and by approximately 80% after reduction with dithiothreitol, and after trypsin treatment. Dialysis of BALF against 1 N acetic acid resulted in a 27% reduction in stimulatory activity. The effect of BALF in promoting type II cell DNA synthesis was more pronounced when tested in the presence of serum, although serum itself has very little effect on type II cell DNA synthesis. When BALF was tested in combination with other substances that stimulate type II cell DNA synthesis (cholera toxin, insulin, epidermal growth factor, and acidic fibroblast growth factor), additive effects or greater were observed. When BALF was chromatographed over Sephadex G150, the activity eluted with an apparent molecular weight of 100 kDa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compliance increased to values comparable to surfactant-treated or term newborn rabbits over a narrow range of saturated phosphatidylcholine pool sizes from about 0.7 to 1.2 mumol/kg for corticosteroid-treated rabbits and from about 0.9 to about 2.3 mumol/kg for control rabbits (p less than 0.01). When these results are compared with those from surfactant-treated rabbits, almost an order of magnitude less endogenous surfactant than exogenous surfactant is needed to alter compliance in preterm ventilated rabbits.\r"

  ".W": "Glutathione (L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine, GSH), a sulfhydryl-containing tripeptide produced by most mammalian cells, is an efficient scavenger of toxic oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide, an oxidant that plays a major role in the oxidant burden placed on the epithelial surface of the lower respiratory tract in chronic inflammatory states. GSH is present in the epithelial lining fluid of the normal lower respiratory tract, where it is thought to play a major role in providing antioxidant protection to the epithelial cells. In this regard, we hypothesized that the lower respiratory tract of patients with IPF may be chronically depleted of this antioxidant, thus leading to an increased susceptibility of lung epithelial cells to oxidant injury. To evaluate this concept, the concentration of glutathione was determined in the epithelial lining fluid of the lower respiratory tract of 15 patients with IPF and compared to that of 19 normal subjects. Strikingly, whereas ELF glutathione concentrations were high in normal subjects (429 +/- 34 microM), a fourfold decrease was found in patients with IPF (97 +/- 18 microM, p less than 0.001). In the context of the known oxidant burden present in the lower respiratory tract of patients with IPF, these observations of a \"GSH deficiency\" in IPF ELF suggest that there is a marked oxidant-antioxidant imbalance at the alveolar surface of these persons, thus increasing the susceptibility to the severe epithelial cell damage characteristic of this disease.\r"

The median recovery of eosinophils during lavage performance was 4% (range, zero to 49) of the nonepithelial cells and significantly increased compared with the recovery in healthy control subjects (less than 1%) and in control patients with sarcoidosis (1%; range, zero to 7). The median BAL fluid concentration of ECP was in IPF 13.3 micrograms/L (range, 2 to 118) and significantly increased compared with the concentrations in healthy control subjects (2.7 micrograms/L; range, less than 2 to 8) and in control patients (6.6 micrograms/L; range, less than 2 to 64). The BAL fluid concentrations of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were also significantly increased in IPF, indicating a local neutrophil activation. A significant correlation was found between BAL fluid ECP and MPO, suggesting a common activator of eosinophils and neutrophils. BAL fluid eosinophils and ECP correlated with the reduced diffusion capacity of the lung but not with vital capacity or forced expiratory volume. It is concluded that eosinophil activation is part of the inflammatory process in IPF. ECP and other cytotoxic eosinophil products may play a pathophysiologic role for the lung damage in this disease.\r"

Although oxygen consumption by PAM from injured lungs after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was increased, it was not significantly different from that of PMA-stimulated PAM fron noninjured lungs. Despite the enhanced oxygen consumption, PAM from injured lungs in suspension did not secrete more superoxide (O2-) than did comparably stimulated PAM from noninjured lungs. It has been suggested that the respiratory burst in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocytes is dependent on the translocation of protein kinase C (PKC). We established that PKC was present in rat PAM and that acute lung injury did not alter total PKC activity or the subcellular distribution of the enzyme. Similarly, stimulation of PAM from noninjured lungs (zymosan, PMA) or injured lungs (zymosan) did not result in translocation of PKC activity, despite an enhanced oxidative burst. These results indicate that although PKC activity was present in PAM, translocation of PKC activity was not necessary for the respiratory burst.\r"

We attempted to correlate changes in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) uptake with an acute oxygen radical-mediated lung injury in dogs. Beta-d glucose/glucose oxidase was injected intravenously in an experimental group (n = 10), while the control group (n = 5) received saline. 5HT uptake, measured using a multiple indicator dilution technique before and 20 min after injection, was calculated for both the percent total uptake and the peak extraction ratio of 5HT during a single passage through the lung. The mean pulmonary and systemic arterial pressures (PAP, SAP), total pulmonary resistance (TPR), extravascular lung water (EVLW), and wet-to-dry weight ratios were also determined. The experimental group showed an acute rise in PAP and TPR and a fall in SAP after the injection, all returning to normal by 20 min; total 5HT uptake fell from 81 +/- 2.3% to 47 +/- 6.5% (p = 0.0002) as did the peak extraction ratio from 0.87 +/- 0.013 to 0.44 +/- 0.066 (p = 0.0001). No change in 5HT uptake was observed in the control group. EVLW did not change in either group, but wet-to-dry weight ratio was elevated in the experimental group (5.21 +/- 0.12 versus 4.73 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.01). ECF studies of 5HT uptake appear to be a sensitive indicator of acute lung injury in this large-animal, oxygen radical-induced injury model.\r"

Such repair would require increased polyamines, but there are reports that two key enzymes of polyamine metabolism are suppressed by hyperoxia or oxidants. Because rats can adapt to hyperoxia but mice cannot, we compared their changes of polyamine metabolism and judged cell repair by using [3H]thymidine to estimate DNA synthesis. Both species developed increased ornithine decarboxylase activity and putrescine content, but the mouse did not develop increased S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activities or increases of spermidine and spermine as did the rat when exposed to 85% O2. Furthermore, we confirmed that the rat lung does respond to hyperoxia with increased DNA synthesis, but the mouse lung does not. The results suggest that in addition to increased activities of protective enzymes, increased repair processes in the rat lung may play a role in its capacity to adapt to hyperoxia. The incomplete response of polyamine metabolism in mice may contribute to their inability to adapt in hyperoxia.\r"

Inbred mice (C57BL/6) were primed systemically and then challenged intratracheally with sheep red blood cells, a T-cell-dependent antigen. At various days later, we performed differential cell counts, measured the concentrations of specific antibody-forming cells, and determined lymphocyte phenotypes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by flow cytometry, distinguishing lymphocytes by light scatter parameters. We found that the numbers of lymphocytes recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage increased significantly in primed mice challenged with the priming antigen but not in three control groups: unprimed mice challenged intratracheally with the same dose of sheep red blood cells, primed mice challenged with hydrochloric acid, and primed mice challenged with a non-cross-reacting erythrocyte. At all times tested the concentrations of antibody-forming cells in bronchoalveolar lavages were identical to those of cells from minced lungs. Helper T-cells (L3T4-positive) increased earliest and constituted the majority of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid throughout the immune response. We conclude: first, that there is a major influx of lymphocytes into the lungs during the development of a specific pulmonary immune response; second, that this lymphocyte influx occurs only in the presence of an antigen-driven response; third, that lymphocytes specific for the challenging antigen are in equilibrium between the bronchoalveolar and interstitial compartments; fourth, flow cytometry can be used to determine surface phenotypes of bronchoalveolar lymphocytes in mice.\r"

In this study, 11 healthy nonsmoking men, 18 to 35 yr of age (mean, 25.4 +/- 3.5), were exposed once to 0.4 ppm O3 and once to filtered air for 2 h with intermittent exercise. Eighteen hours later, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and the cells and fluid were analyzed for various indicators of inflammation. There was an 8.2-fold increase in the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the total cell population, and a small but significant decrease in the percentage of macrophages after exposure to O3. Immunoreactive neutrophil elastase often associated with inflammation and lung damage increased by 3.8-fold in the fluid while its activity increased 20.6-fold in the lavaged cells. A 2-fold increase in the levels of protein, albumin, and IgG suggested increased vascular permeability of the lung. Several biochemical markers that could act as chemotactic or regulatory factors in an inflammatory response were examined in the BAL fluid (BALF). The level of complement fragment C3 alpha was increased by 1.7-fold. The chemotactic leukotriene B4 was unchanged while prostaglandin E2 increased 2-fold. In contrast, three enzyme systems of phagocytes with potentially damaging effects on tissues and microbes, namely, NADPH-oxidase and the lysosomal enzymes acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase, were increased neither in the lavaged fluid nor cells. In addition, the amounts of fibrogenic-related molecules were assessed in BALF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Microvascular leakage was induced by platelet-activating factor (PAF; 50 ng/kg intravenously), which acts directly on venular endothelial cells, and measured by quantifying extravasation of Evans blue (EB) dye. Epinephrine (20 micrograms/kg) inhibited PAF-induced changes in dye leakage in larynx and main bronchi; at 80 and 160 micrograms/kg, significant inhibition was observed in all airways studied. This effect was reversed by phentolamine (2.5 mg/kg) or prazosin (100 micrograms/kg). By contrast, albuterol (20 to 320 micrograms/kg) and aminophylline (12.5 to 50 mg/kg) failed to inhibit dye leakage at any dose studied. Verapamil inhibited PAF-increased leakage in larynx, main bronchi, and intrapulmonary airways at the lowest dose tested (125 micrograms/kg), although inhibition was not dose dependent. These results suggest that the antiedema effect of epinephrine may be due to vasoconstriction rather than to a direct effect on endothelial cell contractility and that neither beta-agonists nor theophylline have an inhibitory effect. The inhibitory effect of epinephrine on airway microvascular leakage may have therapeutic implications for asthma.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the sensitivity of aerosol deposition to airways obstruction by measuring total deposition fraction of inert aerosol in normal conscious sheep (n = 6) after challenging cholinergic agent, pilocarpine (PL) (0.5 mg/kg intravenously) with and without a prior challenge of beta 2-adrenergic agonist, terbutaline sulfate (TS) (0.025 mg/kg subcutaneously). Aerosol deposition was measured by a light-scattering aerosol photometer in situ while sheep rebreathed 1.0-micron-diameter inert oil droplets from a 0.2-L collapsible bag at a rate of 30 breaths/min. Total accumulated deposition at the fifth breath (AD5) as a percentage of initial aerosol concentration was determined and compared with mean pulmonary airflow resistance (RL). After PL, both AD5 and RL increased significantly from baseline values by 51 +/- 9% and 597 +/- 118% (mean +/- SE), respectively, whereas AD5 and RL decreased significantly by 16 +/- 4% and 34 +/- 6%, respectively after TS (p less than 0.05). After PL subsequent to TS (TS-PL), AD5 increased in all six sheep by 33 +/- 7% from post-TS values (p less than 0.05). However, RL did not change from post-TS values. Greater changes in RL than in AD5 after PL (bronchoconstriction) or TS (bronchodilation) suggest a greater sensitivity of RL than AD5 to airway patency in the large airways. Lack of increase of RL after TS-PL indicates that bronchoconstrictive effect of PL was blocked by prior challenge with TS. Therefore, the increase in AD5 after TS-PL may be related to the peripheral airway obstructions which might have been caused by increased secretions induced by a potent secretagogue PL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We wished to determine whether adenosine, a purine nucleotide, modulates activity of respiratory cilia and, to this end, we studied cultured rabbit tracheal epithelium in response to adenosine and related substances in vitro. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) as determined by a photoelectric method was depressed by adenosine (10(-3) M), the maximal decrease from the baseline value (965 +/- 29 beats/min, mean +/- SE) being 31.6 +/- 5.0% (p less than 0.001). The adenosine A2-receptor agonist N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine had only a small effect on ciliary activity, whereas other adenosine analogs elicited decreases in CBF in a dose-dependent fashion. The order of potency of cilia-inhibitory action was N-cyclohexyladenosine (an agonist for adenosine A1-receptor) greater than phenylisopropyladenosine greater than adenosine greater than N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine. Intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels were decreased by 10(-3) M adenosine from 39.2 +/- 6.5 to 25.3 +/- 4.8 pM/mg protein (p less than 0.05). The effect of adenosine on CBF was enhanced by dipyridamole, an adenosine uptake inhibitor, and by deoxycoformycin, an adenosine deaminase inhibitor. The adenosine-induced decreases in CBF and cAMP content were reversed by 8-phenyltheophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist. These results suggest that there is an adenosine A1-receptor on rabbit tracheal epithelium that inhibits adenylate cyclase, which may result in the impairment of respiratory ciliary activity, and that adenosine-induced ciliary inhibition may be modulated by adenosine uptake and its catabolism by airway epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "The nocturnal worsening of asthma is a common problem that can be difficult to treat. Two different sustained-release theophylline preparations were used to determine (1) if the serum theophylline concentrations (STC) depend on the type and dosing schedule of the preparation, (2) the relationship between STC and the circadian variations in asthma, and (3) the effect of STC on sleep quality and respiratory patterns during the night. In 16 subjects with nocturnal asthma, the STC were significantly higher during the daytime on twice-daily versus once-daily theophylline preparations given at 7 P.M., but the FEV1 values were similar. During the night, the STC were significantly higher with the once-daily regimen, and the awakening FEV1 value was also improved (p less than 0.05). All polysomnographic variables were similar between the two preparations, except that with the once-daily preparation there was a decreased number of hypopneas (p less than 0.05) and fewer minutes below an oxygen saturation of 90% (p less than 0.05). We conclude that patients with nocturnal asthma need their treatment focused on the nocturnal portion of the circadian cycle and that higher STC during this critical time period are beneficial without interfering with sleep quality.\r"

Seven asthmatic subjects with known EIA were exercised according to two different protocols on two separate days, which were randomized. On Day A, subjects performed a standard 6-min treadmill run (S1A), which increased heart rate to 98% predicted maximum, followed 45 min later by an identical run (S2A). Refractoriness was demonstrated on the second exercise test, with a mean maximal fall in FEV1 of 29 +/- 3.1% and a PEFR of 32 +/- 2.8% after S2A, compared with a mean maximal fall in FEV1 of 46 +/- 2.6% and a PEFR of 51 +/- 4.0% after S1A. On Day B, subjects performed a 30-min treadmill run at a lower gradient (W1B), followed 21 min later by another standard 6-min treadmill test (S2B). W1B was followed by significantly less EIA (mean maximal fall in FEV1 of 17 +/- 5.4% and a PEFR of 21 +/- 6.3%) than followed S1A. Nevertheless, when subjects subsequently performed a standard 6-min run (S2B), significant refractoriness to bronchoconstriction, comparable to that observed after S2A, developed, with a mean maximal fall in FEV1 of 26 +/- 3.6% and a PEFR of 27 +/- 2.3% (p less than 0.05). We conclude that a warm-up period of exercise can induce refractoriness to EIA without itself inducing marked bronchoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently shown that ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) mismatching at rest in cirrhosis is due to an abnormal pulmonary vascular tone. It has been suggested that in patients with cirrhosis, O2 transfer might become diffusion-limited during exercise. This study examined pulmonary hemodynamics and mechanisms modulating gas exchange during exercise (60 to 70% VO2max) in six patients (41 +/- 5 yr, mean +/- SEM) with cirrhosis but with normal lung function tests. At rest, QT was high (8.4 +/- 0.5 L/min), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was low (0.61 +/- 0.17 mm Hg/L/min), and there was mild to moderate VA/Q mismatching (LogSD Q, 0.79 +/- 0.09; normal range, 0.3 to 0.6). However, hyperventilation (PaCO2, 29 +/- 2 mm Hg) and high QT (thus, high PVO2, 41 +/- 2 mm Hg) contributed to the maintenance of PaO2 within normal values (99 +/- 7 mm Hg). Exercise VO2 (1,278 +/- 122 ml/min) was normal relative to work load, but, contrary to that in normal subjects, QT was higher and PVR did not fall. During exercise, PaO2 showed a trend to decrease (to 90 +/- 5 mm Hg) and PaCO2 to rise (to 35 +/- 2 mm Hg), but the differences failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.07 each). PVO2 fell significantly with exercise (41 +/- 2 to 33 +/- 0.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), but neither AaPO2 (15 +/- 7 to 21 +/- 6 mm Hg) nor VA/Q inequality (LogSD Q, 0.82 +/- 0.11) changed. No systemic difference was noticed between predicted and measured PaO2 values, suggesting no O2 diffusion impairment during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have used a double-blind study with random allocation of patients to receive either pirbuterol or an identical-appearing placebo. Six patients received 15 mg pirbuterol thrice daily, and five patients received a similar placebo thrice daily, over a 6-month period. The first 15-mg dose of pirbuterol by mouth at the beginning of the study raised the heart rate from 84 +/- 13 to 100 +/- 16 beats/min (mean +/- SD) (p less than 0.01), and cardiac output from 5.2 +/- 0.9 to 6.4 +/- 0.8 L/min (p less than 0.01) and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) from 0.28 +/- 0.10 to 0.33 +/- 0.12 (p less than 0.01) within 120 min after receiving the drug, but without significant change in the mean pulmonary arterial pressure. None of these variables changed significantly after an acute dose of placebo in another four patients. Repeated measurements after 6 months of chronic oral therapy with either pirbuterol or placebo showed that 16 h after the last 15-mg oral dose of pirbuterol or placebo, the heart rate, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, cardiac output, total pulmonary vascular resistance, and RVEF were all not significantly different from the values 6 months previously, before receiving either pirbuterol or the placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tannin (2 to 50 micrograms/ml) caused concentration-dependent contractions of resting vessels, and maximal responses averaged 25% of the contraction induced by 10(-4) M exogenous norepinephrine. Tannin-induced contractions were blocked by removal of the endothelium and by pretreatment of intact tissues with either indomethacin or SQ 29,548, a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist. In contrast, tissues contracted with 3 x 10(-7) M norepinephrine relaxed by 49 +/- 8% in response to 50 micrograms/ml tannin. Tannin-induced relaxations were unaltered by pretreatment of tissues with indomethacin but were significantly reduced by pretreatment with hemoglobin. We conclude that tannin causes the release of both smooth muscle contracting and relaxing factors from pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Thromboxane A2 is the contracting factor, whereas an endothelium-derived relaxing factor such as nitric oxide appears to be the primary relaxing factor that is released.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional ventilators are frequently used at high rates in the intensive care nursery to achieve adequate oxygenation and ventilation with reduced peak inspiratory pressure. The efficacy and limitations of high frequency positive-pressure ventilation (HFPPV) using a conventional ventilator were studied by comparing the cardiopulmonary effects of HFPPV with those of high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) in an animal model of respiratory failure. Sixteen saline-lavaged rabbits were ventilated with either HFPPV or HFJV for 2 h using rates of 200 breaths/min, inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1:2, and FIO2 of 1.0. As controls an additional eight lavaged rabbits were ventilated at conventional rates (40 to 60 breaths/min). Proximal peak inspiratory pressure as indicated on the ventilator manometer or drive pressure was adjusted to maintain acceptable blood gases. Cardiac output (CO) was measured by thermodilution. Although there was a significant decrease in cardiac function over time, there were no significant differences between the groups in CO or stroke volume. Satisfactory oxygenation and ventilation were maintained in all groups. Static respiratory system compliance and mean airway pressure were similar among the groups. Histologic examination of the lungs revealed no differences between the three ventilator groups. The results of this study indicate that both HFPPV and HFJV are effective in short-term maintenance of normal blood gases in respiratory failure without any discernable differences in their effects on cardiovascular function. At very high rates, however, increases in VT are not possible with HFPPV, which limits its usefulness and flexibility in respiratory failure.\r"

First, we determined the relationship between parasternal intramuscular pressure (Pps), measured with Gaeltec 12 CT-mini-transducers, and parasternal EMG activity (Eps) during breathing at FRC and near TLC. Second, we examined the changes in Pps and the changes in parasternal force (Fps) generated during bilateral parasternal stimulation at FRC and near TLC with a given supramaximal stimulus. Before phrenicotomy, the inspiratory increases in Pps remained relatively constant near TLC (FRC, 50.4 +/- 16.5 versus TLC, 48.7 +/- 13.3 cm H2O, NS), whereas the Eps clearly decreased (82.9 +/- 5.5% FRC, p less than 0.01). This indicates that the gain converting electrical activity into pressure for the parasternals is greater near TLC than at FRC. A similar pattern of changes in Pps and in Eps was observed during quiet inspiration at FRC and near TLC after phrenicotomy. During bilateral parasternal stimulation the increases in Pps near TLC tended to be greater than those at FRC (140.7 +/- 28.6 versus 100 +/- 28.3 cm H2O, NS), whereas the increases in Fps were significantly greater near TLC than at FRC (277.4 +/- 60.6 versus 214.2 +/- 47.1 g, p less than 0.05). Therefore, we conclude that the mechanical effectiveness of the parasternal contraction near TLC remains relatively unchanged and is even greater in relation to that at FRC.\r"

While a proximal myopathy is frequently recognized, diaphragm muscle function has not hitherto been studied in detail in thyrotoxicosis. The strength of the quadriceps femoris and respiratory muscles was therefore assessed in seven consecutive thyrotoxic patients, on presentation and during medical treatment, when euthyroid. Prior to therapy, reduced quadriceps muscle strength, vital capacity, and global expiratory and inspiratory muscle strength were found. Diaphragmatic weakness was present in one of four patients studied by measuring transdiaphragmatic pressures during maximal sniffs and during bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation at 1 Hz (twitch). After treatment, significant improvement occurred in quadriceps muscle strength, vital capacity, and global respiratory muscle strength. Sniff and twitch transdiaphragmatic pressures also increased significantly. These results indicate that respiratory muscle weakness occurs in hyperthyroidism and that such weakness is reversible with medical treatment. It is important to realize that respiratory muscles may be directly affected when assessing thyrotoxic patients with breathlessness, as severe involvement of the respiratory muscles may cause respiratory failure.\r"

Because previous studies indicated that bronchoscopic aspirates are usually contaminated by oropharyngeal flora, we anticipated that BAL fluid would also likely be contaminated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform quantitative bacterial cultures on BAL fluids obtained from eight normal subjects. Prior to each procedure, saline was aspirated through the bronchoscope and submitted for culture. A protected brush catheter (PBC) specimen was obtained from each subject's right middle lobe, and then a BAL specimen was obtained from the same location. All specimens were quantitatively cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. In addition, lidocaine concentrations were measured in the BAL fluids and the PBC specimens. Six of the eight bronchoscope cultures were sterile. Seven of the eight PBC specimens were sterile and one yielded less than 10(3) cfu/ml of normal oropharyngeal flora. One BAL fluid specimen was sterile and seven yielded from one to four bacterial strains each; however, quantitation revealed less than 10(4) cfu/ml in all specimens. Lidocaine concentrations (mean +/- 1 SD) were as follows: PBC specimen, 0.81 microgram/ml (+/- 0.62); BAL fluid specimen, 62.6 micrograms/ml (+/- 43). We conclude that BAL fluid obtained from normal subjects is frequently contaminated by oropharyngeal bacterial flora.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using macrophage membranes, the receptor density (Bmax) was 42 +/- 9 fmol/mg protein with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 44 +/- 9 pM (mean +/- SEM). With intact macrophages, the Bmax = 5,643 +/- 942 sites/cell with Kd = 29 +/- 9 pM. Competition binding studies with subtype-specific antagonists revealed an exclusive population of beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Incubation of intact macrophages with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol caused a 6-fold increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). Prostaglandin E1 and forskolin, which activate adenylate cyclase via different mechanisms, afforded typical marked increases in macrophage cAMP. Saturation binding, competition binding, and cAMP accumulation studies may all be performed from a single sample of about 2 x 10(7) cells, which can be obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage. This should facilitate studies of in vivo regulation of human alveolar macrophage beta-adrenergic receptors with regard to immune function and mediator release, and as a possible reflection of lung parenchymal receptors.\r"

Serial ventilation-perfusion scans over the first 12 months showed progressive improvement without returning to normal. After the initial recovery, there has been no significant change over the subsequent two years postinjury. Pulmonary function and exercise tests also displayed a similar pattern of initial improvement. We conclude that (1) acute exposure to high concentrations of SO2 results in severe airways obstruction, (2) pulmonary function abnormalities are partially reversible, and (3) most of the improvement occurs within 12 months after the initial injury.\r"

  ".W": "In July 1980, an aggressive screening program for benign disease of the stomach in 163 patients at risk for carcinomatous change of the gastric remnant was instituted. All patients were at least ten years post-gastrectomy. Three gastric remnant cancers were identified during esophago-gastroduodenostomy (EGD) on 45 patients undergoing only one screening endoscopic examination during the study. One hundred and eighteen additional patients underwent two or more screening gastroscopic studies between July 1980 and July 1985. Of this group, seven patients (5.8%) had gastric biopsies showing mild to moderate dysplasia in the gastric remnant. During the period July 1985 to July 1987, these seven patients underwent two to four additional gastroscopic examinations that revealed carcinoma of the gastric remnant in two patients (28%) with progression of the dysplastic changes in three of these seven patients (42%). The post-gastrectomy interval in these seven patients ranged from 10 to 27 years with a mean of 21.5 years. This study supports the concept of neoplastic change in the gastric remnant as a function of time from initial gastric resection. EGD and biopsy are important in identifying dysplastic changes which may be harbingers of invasive carcinoma of the gastric remnant. Aggressive endoscopic screening is recommended for patients with dysplasia in order to identify gastric remnant cancer while potentially curable.\r"

Age at the time of operation ranged from one to 46 months. There were eight girls and two boys with Type I choledochal cysts. One child with a dilated but histologically normal common bile duct underwent a choledochoduodenostomy. The remaining nine patients had excision of the choledochal cyst. Continuity with the GI tract was then re-established with a valved isolated jejunal segment interposed between the common hepatic duct and the duodenum. The valve serves to prevent reflux of enteric contents up into the biliary tract. The short jejunal segment allows bile to drain into the duodenum with minimal stasis; this more closely approximates the natural physiologic state than does a Roux-en-Y reconstruction. There was no mortality, with follow up ranging from six months to over eight years. Two post-operative complications (one anastomotic stricture and one small bowel obstruction) occurred, both in the same patient. There were no anastomotic leaks and no episodes of post-operative cholangitis. All patients are currently free of jaundice and none have signs of portal hypertension. The treatment of choledochal cysts is excision. Biliary tract reconstruction with the valved common hepatico-jejuno-duodenostomy is safe, effective, and physiologically appealing.\r"

The groups were comparable in mean age and extent of pancreatic resection. Operative time in Group I patients who did not require additional major procedures was 3.74 +/- 1.01 hours, compared with 2.86 +/- 1.68 hours for similar Group II patients. The overall complication rate in Group I was 40 per cent, including two pancreatic fistulas, one subphrenic abscess, and one gastric fistula. In Group II the overall complication rate was 36.4 per cent, with one pancreatic fistula, one subphrenic abscess, and one colonic fistula. Splenic infarction occurred in only one patient (Group II), in whom both splenic vessels were ligated. No patient developed insulin-dependent diabetes. There were no deaths. The mean hospitalization time was 18.8 days in Group I, and 17.5 days in Group II. Splenectomy should not be considered a routine part of distal pancreatic resection. Splenic preservation can be achieved in selected cases with no increase in complication rate, operative time, or length of postoperative hospitalization.\r"

Differentiation between pseudo-obstruction and mechanical obstruction can be difficult and may require laparotomy to establish the diagnosis. Intestinal manometry suggested a mechanical cause for obstruction in two patients and should be done in all patients that carry the diagnosis of intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Other clues to the diagnosis of intestinal pseudo-obstruction are discussed. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is an uncommon disease that should not be a diagnosis of exclusion but should be diagnosed using historical, radiographic, manometric, pathologic, and operative data.\r"

We treated 16 patients with abdominal candidiasis over a 36 month period. Violation of the gastrointestinal tract mucosa was the most common precipitating event (13 patients). Predisposing factors included: CVP catheters, broad spectrum antibiotics, and parenteral hyperalimentation in all patients, H2-blockers/antacids in 14 patients, as well as malnutrition (7 patients), DM (3 patients), alcoholism (3 patients), and steroids/chemotherapy (3 patients). Candida was isolated from an abscess in seven patients, peritoneal fluid in six patients and both in three patients. In four patients abdominal candidiasis was preceded by positive cultures from blood or two peripheral sites which had not been treated. All patients were treated with amphotericin B (146-4000 mg) without any major adverse effects. Fungal infection was eradicated in ten patients; three patients succumbed to candidiasis. Patients treated within seven days required less Amphotericin B and appeared to have a better outcome than those having delayed treatment. The authors conclude that abdominal candidiasis is a potentially lethal infection in critically ill surgical patients that should be aggressively treated. Amphotericin B can be safely administered and concurrent antibiotics need not be stopped.\r"

Although methods for surgical drainage of abscesses and fistulous tracts are well established, the optimal method for surgical prevention of continued peritoneal soilage remains controversial. The authors applied the principle of complete gastrointestinal disconnection and performed diversion of the gastrointestinal tract and tube decompression proximal to the fistulous opening in the treatment of 22 critically ill patients with intra-abdominal sepsis from gastric or small bowel fistulas. Patient survival varied according to the level of the site of gastrointestinal leakage. All patients (5 out of 5) who had leakage in the distal small bowel survived. Six of nine (66%) patients with leakage from the proximal jejunum and six of eight (75%) of patients with gastroduodenal leakage survived. The overall survival rate of 77 per cent observed in this group of patients supports the authors' hypothesis that complete gastrointestinal disconnection is a valuable adjunct in the treatment of these severely ill patients.\r"

  ".W": "Debate concerning the superiority of cholecystoenteric bypass (CCEB) vs. choledochoenteric bypass (CDEB) in patients with pancreatic cancer and biliary obstruction prompted this review. Thirty-six patients with biliary duct obstruction due to pancreatic cancer underwent 37 operations for biliary decompression between 1976 and 1986: 22 CCEB, 15 CDEB. Age, sex, race, preoperative health, and preoperative symptoms and signs were similar for both groups. Seven CDEB patients had previous cholecystectomy (n = 5) and failed CCEB (n = 2). Twenty CCEB patients and 13 CDEB patients had elevated preoperative total bilirubin with an average abnormal bilirubin of 15.3 mg per cent and 12.0 mg per cent, respectively. Perioperative significant morbidity/mortality was seen in 59.1 per cent and 22.7 per cent, respectively, in CCEB and 53.3 per cent and 6.7 per cent in CDEB. Twenty (90.9%) CCEB patients and 15 (100%) CDEB eventually succumbed to either their operation or pancreatic cancer: average survival was 7.5 months (range, 2-41 months) and 10.4 months (range, 2-30 months), respectively. Two CCEB patients were alive at 15 and 41 months. Eleven out of 22 CCEB patients (50%) experienced short term (within 2 months of surgery) absence of jaundice, icterus, pruritus, and biliary tract disease symptoms or signs, and six out of 12 experienced long term (more than 3 months after surgery) absence of these problems; with CDEB, 14 patients out of 15 (93%) experienced short term and 10 out of 12 patients (83%) experienced long term absence of these problems. Cholecystoenteric bypass is a significantly morbid procedure and yet does not reliably palliate biliary obstruction due to pancreatic cancer; it is not preferred.\r"

The authors reviewed their operative experience for PUD over a five year period beginning in July 1982. One hundred and sixty-two operative procedures were performed on 160 patients. The indications for surgery were intractability (18); perforation (50); hemorrhage (81); and obstruction (13). The average ages of the survivors and those who died was 49.0 and 65.7 years respectively. Partial gastric resection (PGR), with or without vagotomy, was the most commonly performed procedure (54% of cases) while vagotomy and drainage (V & D) was used in 31 per cent of patients. The overall mortality in this series was 8 per cent; it was highest in the hemorrhage group (10%). Pre-operative transfusion requirements in this population were greater in those who died versus those who survived (12.1 and 7.3 units respectively, P less than 0.005). In addition, 75 per cent of the deaths were over 60 years of age. In elderly patients operated upon for hemorrhage, the procedure-related mortality for V & D and PGR was 24 per cent and 13 per cent respectively. (These groups were similar with regard to co-morbidity, hemodynamic stability, and transfusion requirements). It is the authors contention that PGR may be safely used for the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcer disease (particularly GU) in selected elderly, high-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "The management of extensive abdominal tissue loss in the presence of intraabdominal infection or wound dehiscence challenges the surgeon's ingenuity in wound care. Radical debridement and primary fascial closure may be impossible due to tissue loss or extensive bowel edema. The use of a synthetic mesh to bridge the fascial defect and maintain the integrity of the abdominal cavity may initially appear to be an attractive alternative to simply leaving the viscera exposed. However, this report and review of the literature document the frequent complications and high morbidity associated with this technique. An overall complication rate approaching 80% can be anticipated if polypropylene mesh is used in this emergency situation. Two modifications of wound care appear to markedly diminish the incidence of serious complications. Covering the mesh with full-thickness skin or muscle flaps in the early postoperative period, or removing the mesh at the earliest time conducive to fascial closure (within 2 weeks) reduced the overall complication rate from 55% to 15% in this review. However, it is often impossible to predict which patients will be amenable to early mesh removal, and full-thickness coverage of a persistently infected wound is usually doomed to failure. Despite the occasional usefulness of these modifications, this review suggests that polypropylene mesh in the emergency setting has an unacceptably high complication rate, and alternative methods of wound care in these complex situations should be considered.\r"

DESIGN: The self-report questionnaire was administered at the same time the following variables were assessed: American Rheumatism Association functional class, joint count, hand radiograph, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor titer, walking time, grip strength, button test, and global self-assessment. SETTING: University rheumatology clinic, the rheumatology clinic of a Veterans Administration hospital, and a private rheumatology practice. PATIENTS: The study included 259 patients who met the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association for a diagnosis of definite or classic rheumatoid arthritis. INTERVENTIONS: Standard rheumatologic care for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Self-report questionnaire scores were significantly correlated with the joint count, radiographic score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, grip strength, button test, walking time, American Rheumatism Association functional class, and global self-assessment. Patients were categorized into five questionnaire score categories of 1.00, indicating no dysfunction, and 1.01 to 1.50, 1.51 to 2.00, 2.01 to 3.00, and 3.01 to 4.00, indicating progressive dysfunction. In these five categories, more than ten involved joints were seen in 11%, 37%, 67%, 79%, and 100% of patients, respectively, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates greater than 20 mm/h in 29%, 49%, 64%, 74%, and 85% of patients, respectively. Similar results were seen for other physical and radiographic measures. The questionnaire score was as effective in explaining other measures of clinical status as was any other available measure. CONCLUSIONS: A simple self-report questionnaire provides information similar to many traditional measures in rheumatoid arthritis and appears to be an attractive, cost-effective approach to assessing and monitoring quantitatively the status of an individual patient.\r"

DESIGN: In-vitro toxicity assay on lymphocytes. SETTING: Clinics for adverse drug reactions in an adult and pediatric tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained from 46 normal volunteers and 76 patients referred to the clinic for assessment of adverse drug reactions to sulfonamide agents. Thirty-one patients had clinical histories consistent with a diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction, whereas 45 patients had clinical histories felt to be inconsistent with a diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction. INTERVENTIONS: Lymphocytes were assayed with tetrazolium to determine toxicity from the hydroxylamine of sulfamethoxazole. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The lymphocytes from patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions showed markedly increased toxicity across a tenfold-concentration toxicity-concentration curve compared with those from controls and patients with a history of nonhypersensitivity reactions. These differences were highly significant (P less than 0.01). No difference was found between the toxicity shown by the lymphocytes from controls and that shown by the lymphocytes from patients with a history of nonhypersensitivity reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic differences in the production and detoxification of reactive metabolites of sulfonamide agents are important determinants of hypersensitivity reactions to these agents. These results suggest that the hydroxylamine derivative of sulfamethoxazole may be a reactive metabolite mediating these reactions. Sulfonamide hydroxylamines are useful in the diagnosis and study of the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions to sulfonamide agents.\r"

  ".W": "We report the clinical and neuropathological characteristics occurring in 180 demented individuals from 24 kindreds with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Each family had at least two affected generations, and at least one autopsy or brain biopsy was compatible with the diagnosis of AD. Forty-nine neuropathological specimens or reports were reviewed. Mean age of onset for the total group was 54.7 years +/- 11.5, with a large range of 30 to 84 years. Mean age at death was 63.5 years +/- 12.2, with a range of 46 to 85. Mean duration of disease was 8.8 years +/- 4.4, with a range of 1 to 23 years. Six findings suggested phenotypic heterogeneity in FAD. (1) Five families represented an early age of onset group with mean onset at 42 years (range 30 to 51 years) and mean disease duration of 6.7 years. (2) Eight families represented a late onset group with mean onset at 68 years (range 59 to 78 years) and a mean duration of 8.5 years. (3) Seven families were of Volga German ancestry, all originating from the same two villages in Russia. Mean age of onset was 55.9 years (range 40 to 72 years), with a mean disease duration of 10 years. This group probably represents the genetic founder effect of an autosomal dominant gene for AD. (4) One family had the unusual characteristics of neurofibrillary tangles and granulovacuolar change but no amyloid plaques, a mean disease duration of more than 11 years, and a \"schizophrenia-like\" onset. (5) One family with late onset also had clinical and pathological evidence for anterior horn cell disease. (6) Two autopsies in 1 family both showed remarkable rarefaction of myelin and expansion of perivascular spaces in centrum semiovale (etat crible), with marked leptomeningeal and cortical amyloid angiopathy, distinct from the other FAD brains. It remains to be determined whether the clinical and pathological differences between these families represent genetic heterogeneity at the biochemical or molecular level.\r"

Following severe trauma, resulting in spastic paraplegia, there was a delayed and progressive accumulation of lactic acid, a decline in intracellular pH, and a loss of high-energy phosphates. Maximal alterations occurred between 2 and 3 hours after the trauma, with little further change by 4 hours. Histological examination 2 weeks after trauma showed tissue necrosis and cavitation. These findings support the concept of secondary tissue injury after spinal cord trauma and suggest that early changes in metabolism, as shown by MRS, may predict irreversible tissue damage.\r"

  ".W": "Although the incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) has decreased in recent years, the increasing survival rates for the smallest premature infants indicate that the lesion will continue to be a major problem in neonatal intensive care facilities. The neuropathology is characterized by an elemental lesion, bleeding into the subependymal germinal matrix, with subsequent rupture into the lateral ventricle. Important neuropathological consequences are germinal matrix destruction, posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, and periventricular hemorrhagic infarction. The last of these appears to be a venous infarction and is a critical determinant of neurological outcome. Neuropathological accompaniments, not caused by the IVH, include periventricular leukomalacia and pontine neuronal necrosis. The pathogenesis of IVHs is related to intravascular, vascular, and extravascular factors. Intravascular factors involve primarily control of blood flow and pressure in the microcirculation of the germinal matrix. Particular pathogenetic importance can be attached to fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, abrupt increases in flow, decreases in flow with injury to matrix vessels, increases in cerebral venous pressure, and, in selected infants, disturbances of platelet function and coagulation. Vascular factors relate to the microcirculation of the matrix, the site of the initial bleeding. A maturation-dependent alteration in vascular integrity and a vulnerability of matrix vessels to ischemic injury appear important. Extravascular factors include those relevant to mesenchymal and glial support for matrix vessels and to local fibrinolytic activity in the germinal matrix. The latter may be a manifestation of the proteolytic activity now recognized to be of general importance in developmental remodeling of the mammalian central nervous system.\r"

In contrast, our own studies of stretch reflex dynamics in spastic elbow flexor muscles of 14 hemiparetic human subjects have shown that stretch-evoked torque displays a relatively weak dependence on stretch velocity, and there is generally no preferential enhancement of dynamic as compared with static reflex output. Moreover, stretch reflex dynamics are broadly similar in voluntarily activated spastic and normal elbow flexor muscles. These findings support our hypothesis that spastic hypertonia results primarily from a decrease in stretch reflex threshold. The strong velocity dependence of stretch-evoked electromyographic activity in initially inactive spastic muscles could be due to a decrease in reflex threshold with increasing stretch velocity, rather than an abnormal velocity-dependent increase in stretch reflex responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of serial magnetic resonance (MR) scans of the brain was carried out every 2 weeks for 4 to 6 months in 9 patients with mild, clinically definite, relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Six of the 9 patients developed a total of 12 asymptomatic new lesions in various parts of the brain. In none of the patients were the changes on MR scan accompanied by relevant new neurological symptoms or signs. New MR lesions had a characteristic temporal profile, reaching a maximum size in approximately 4 weeks before gradually shrinking, usually leaving a small residual abnormality indistinguishable from chronic MS lesions. The frequent occurrence of new asymptomatic lesions indicates that MS may be a more active process even in mildly affected asymptomatic patients than has been previously realized. The results emphasize the potential importance of using MR scanning to measure disease activity in laboratory studies of MS and in the assessment of treatment, particularly in asymptomatic patients in the early stages. We suggest that the expanding and contracting new lesions are the basic or primary lesion in MS, that the characteristic demyelinated plaque is represented by the small residual area that these lesions shrink down to, and that the typical collection of scattered white matter lesions in chronic MS may represent the accumulated residua of dozens or more of these active lesions occurring over many years.\r"

Tetrahydrobiopterin is an essential cofactor and may be rate-limiting for the synthesis of catecholamines and serotonin. Accordingly, total cerebrospinal fluid biopterin was measured and found to be elevated in patients compared with controls (p less than 0.002).

The functional deficit caused by stroke was assessed at the time of evoked potential testing and again on follow-up 2 months after stroke. Stroke location and degree of recovery were compared with the evoked potentials elicited an average of 8 days after the acute event. The motor response was better (p less than 0.01) than somatosensory response at predicting an outcome in terms of functional recovery, both overall and when comparing patients with similar degrees of weakness. Normal somatosensory evoked potentials also predicted recovery but were not as sensitive as the motor evoked potentials (0.01 less than p less than 0.05). Motor evoked potentials in conjunction with clinical assessment may offer a means of more accurately predicting functional outcome following stroke than can be achieved with clinical assessment, with or without somatosensory evoked potentials. The additional finding that cortically evoked motor evoked potentials were delayed only by subcortical lesions is of interest and may extend the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of this response in humans.\r"

Computer-assisted quantitation of magnetic resonance images revealed a higher mean lesion load in chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (CPMS); however, in approximately 20% of benign MS patients the lesion load was higher than that in the CPMS patients. CPMS patients had a higher number of infratentorial lesions, yet similar numbers of supratentorial lesions, when compared with benign MS patients. The degree of confluency of lesions and the clinical expression of infratentorial lesions were typically higher in the CPMS patients. Benign MS was characterized by a lower degree of confluency and a higher number of asymptomatic infratentorial lesions. Thus, magnetic resonance imaging shows characteristic differences in magnetic resonance-detected changes between MS patients with different clinical courses.\r"

All patients had prolonged electroencephalographic video monitoring with scalp and subdural electrodes, and their speech dominance was determined with an intracarotid amobarbital test. Speech manifestations were observed in 79 seizures and were classified as vocalization, normal speech, or abnormal speech. Vocalization of sounds without speech quality occurred ictally in 48.5% of patients. Normal speech (identifiable speech) occurred ictally in 34.2% of patients. Abnormal speech (speech arrest, dysphasia, dysarthria, and nonidentifiable speech) occurred in 51.4% of patients, either ictally or postictally. Of all the above speech manifestations, only postictal dysphasia and ictal identifiable speech had significant lateralizing value: 92% of patients with postictal dysphasia had their seizures originating from the dominant temporal lobe (p less than 0.001), and 83% of those with ictal identifiable speech had their seizures from the nondominant side (p = 0.013). This study shows that speech manifestations are common in complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin and can provide an excellent clinical tool for lateralization of seizure onset.\r"

Only 8% of normal controls had similar antibodies. The pattern of serum antibody reactivity correlated with the pattern of clinical involvement in our patients. Selective reactivity to GD1a ganglioside was common when upper motor neuron signs were prominent. IgM reactivity to GM1 ganglioside was common in ALS patients with prominent lower motor neuron signs. Most patients with motor neuropathies had serum reactivity to both GM1 and GD1a gangliosides. These results provide further evidence of ongoing autoimmune processes in ALS patients.

One study compared the new agent with a placebo cream and the other with miconazole nitrate, an established effective antifungal agent. The investigators found a much higher \"cure\" rate for tioconazole when both treatment groups were known to receive active agents than the cure rate for tioconazole found in the placebo-controlled study. These results showed that the expectations of investigators can influence their clinical evaluations. Such bias could also influence the results of clinical trials.\r"

Protein antigens were isolated from homogenates of these glands by denaturing electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with serum samples obtained from human volunteers. A spectrum of antigens with a wide range of molecular weights (14 to 126 kilodaltons) were identified by antibodies in human serum for each species. Both species-unique and species-shared antigens were present. The results of these studies indicate that the humoral response to mosquito bite is complex, with a multitude of antigens provoking antibody responses. Since each individual has his or her own unique exposure history to mosquitoes, it seems unlikely that desensitization to a specific immunogen will confer protection in clinical situations in which multiple exposures to a variety of mosquito species occur.\r"

Activation of the stretch receptors in the veins by venous distention induces reflex vasoconstriction and hypoxia. In patients with defective venous return, exercise fails to reduce venous pressure when the legs are dependent; therefore, hypoxia persists during exercise. Surgical treatment of venous incompetence abolishes the abnormal venous reflux and restores the normal vasodilator response to exercise, thereby correcting the sustained hypoxia observed in patients with venous leg ulcers.\r"

Topical methotrexate (0.1%, 0.5%, and 1%) in a laurocapram-containing formulation was tested in a two-center double-blind pilot clinical study of 42 patients with plaque psoriasis. Drugs were applied twice a day for six weeks, and lesions were scored weekly for erythema, scale, and elevation. An overall improvement of 50% or more in the combined scores for erythema, scale, and elevation was obtained with 0.1% methotrexate (64% of patients), 0.5% methotrexate (59%), and 1% methotrexate (56%) vs the vehicle alone (25%).

We administered active forms of vitamin D3 in both oral and topical ways in an open-design study to patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Significant improvement was observed at the end of the study periods in these patients, especially in those treated with topical application of calcitriol. We also found a significant negative correlation between the severity of psoriasis and the basal serum level of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D but not with those of other calcium-related parameters in psoriatic patients. These data suggest that exogenous active forms of vitamin D3 are effective for treatment of psoriasis and that the endogenous 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level also may be involved in the development of this skin disease.\r"

  ".W": "A major proinflammatory metabolite of arachidonic acid, leukotriene B4, is known to accumulate in the lesions of psoriasis. Most of this metabolite is biosynthesized by the polymorphonuclear cells that infiltrate into the psoriatic lesions. Epidermal 15-lipoxygenase, on the other hand, metabolizes arachidonic acid into 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-20:4n-6), presumably serving as a negative feedback to inhibit the local generation of leukotriene B4. Eicosapentaenoic acid, a major polyunsaturated fatty acid in fish oil, and gamma-linolenic acid, a poly-unsaturated fatty acid in certain vegetable oils, are both metabolized by epidermal 15-lipoxygenase into 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-OH-20:5n-3) and 15-hydroxyeicosatriaenoic acid (15-OH-20:3n-3), respectively. Both of these monohydroxy acids are potent in vitro inhibitors of leukotriene B4 generation. It seems reasonable, therefore, that adequate dietary supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid or gamma-linolenic acid may offer a novel and nontoxic approach to suppressing cutaneous inflammatory disorders.\r"

Sequential serum concentrations obtained on eight individual patients were used to determine half-lives for this late-phase elimination. The median half-life for the 12 curves obtained was 12.5 weeks (range, 5.3 to 24.8 weeks). Since etretinate is stored in fat, we compared each patient's deviation from ideal body weight as a measure of excess body fat with various pharmacokinetic factors of etretinate elimination. Overweight patients tended to have slower elimination, maintain higher serum concentrations, and clear etretinate later.\r"

Cultured melanocytes showed dendritic morphologic features, contained mature melanosomes, and reacted with monoclonal antibody to tyrosinase. Nevus cells were spindle shaped and expressed nevus cell-associated antigens. Melanocytes, nevus cells, and dermal fibroblasts from the patient with XP all had a similar reduction in DNA repair: unscheduled DNA synthesis was 30% to 50% of that in normal fibroblasts following a 30 J/m2 ultraviolet dose. After a 6 J/m2 ultraviolet dose, the proliferative ability of XP nevus cells and fibroblasts was reduced to 10% of that of normal fibroblasts. This study indicates that cultured melanocytes and nevus cells express the characteristic XP DNA repair defect.\r"

Factors that predicted cessation of use in adulthood paralleled those that predicted lack of initiation in adolescence: conventionality in social role performance, social context unfavorable to the use of drugs, and good health. A most important predictor was prior degree of involvement in licit and illicit drugs. In multivariate analyses, degree of prior drug involvement remained the strongest predictor of drug cessation for of marijuana use, while friends' use was the most important for cocaine. Those who use drugs in response to social influences are more likely to stop using them than those who also use drugs for psychological reasons.\r"

Men were more likely to be employed, to hold higher status jobs, and to be self-supporting. Women were more likely to cite specific reasons for drug use, while men tended to use cocaine as part of a larger pattern of antisocial behavior. Women were diagnosed more often as having major depression, and their depressive symptoms improved much more slowly than men's when drug free. These findings suggest that women cocaine abusers may initially experience more residual problems, eg, depression and job dissatisfaction, than men after becoming drug free. Drug treatment centers should be alert to possible differences based on gender.\r"

Baseline cortisol levels did not distinguish early panickers from non-panickers and controls, but late panickers had significantly elevated baseline cortisol levels. In addition, a higher percentage of late panickers manifested an increase in cortisol during the baseline period compared with the other groups. Despite the fact that late panickers manifested elevated baseline cortisol levels, early panickers had significantly greater somatic distress as measured by the Acute Panic inventory. There was no increase in cortisol with lactate-induced panic, and cortisol levels fell significantly during the lactate infusion in all groups. Cortisol elevation occurred with moderate anxiety but not with severe panic anxiety. These results suggest different pathophysiologic mechanisms of early and late panic, and differences between anticipatory anxiety and panic anxiety.\r"

One theory to explain lactate's anxiety-producing effects involves its ability to induce alkalosis because of metabolic conversion to bicarbonate. To test this hypothesis, we administered both sodium lactate and sodium bicarbonate infusions in counterbalanced order to patients with panic disorder. Thirteen of 22 subjects panicked in response to lactate and nine of 20 subjects panicked in response to bicarbonate. Although the rate of panic between the two infusion responses was not significantly different, several aspects of response to the two infusions indicated that lactate may be a more potent producer of anxiety than bicarbonate. An unexpected finding was that bicarbonate panickers had a reduction in arterial carbon dioxide pressure during the infusion, while bicarbonate nonpanickers had an increase in arterial carbon dioxide pressure during the infusion. Induction of hyperventilation and subsequent hypocapnia appears to be a common denominator between lactate- and bicarbonate-induced panic.\r"

To explore another possible cause for the physiological changes known to occur during a panic attack, we assessed parasympathetic nervous system activity by measuring vagal tone during treatments known to produce panic symptoms: sodium lactate administration and hyperventilation. Our findings showed a marked reduction in vagal tone during both procedures. We postulate that withdrawal of parasympathetic activity may explain some of the physiological changes occurring in panic attacks and be contributing to the origin of panic.\r"

Patients with panic disorder showed an increased fall in blood pressure and decreased sedative and endocrine responses as compared with controls. These results suggest that there may be subsensitivity of some, and supersensitivity of other, brain alpha 2-adrenoceptors in panic disorder. In view of the increased cardiovascular responses seen in the present study and other reports of increased responses to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, there may exist an increased lability (decreased damping) of cardiovascular control mechanisms in panic disorder.

  ".W": "Triage skills are requisite for all providers of prehospital care. Methods of assessing the acquisition of triage skills vary in complexity and expense. In this study, 61 prehospital care providers classified 20 cases, divided into four groups of five cases each: moulaged live trauma victims, nonmoulaged live trauma victims, nonmoulaged manikin trauma victims, and written scenarios. The providers were asked to classify the cases in each group by assigning triage tags to indicate injury severity and to rank the trauma victims in each group according to the urgency of care required. Analysis of variance revealed statistically significant differences among the four methods in both mean tagging scores (F3,235 = 8.63, P less than .0001) and mean ranking scores (F3,232 = 6.09, P less than .001). Multiple comparisons using Scheffe's test revealed that the mean tagging and ranking scores for moulaged live victims and written scenario methods were comparable and that both were significantly superior to the scores of the two other methods. However, a qualitative evaluation revealed that the providers greatly preferred triage of moulaged live victims to the other three methods.\r"

In a demonstration project over a 2-year period, CHWs provided (1) BP and pulse measurements, and educational counseling regarding HBP and cardiovascular risk factors; (2) telephone preappointment reminders to improve ED follow-up visit rates; and (3) recontact of patients failing to show for their ED follow-up visits to improve return rates even after missed BP appointments. Results of preappointment reminders by CHWs showed a 19% improvement in appointment keeping (P less than .001). With a sample of patients who had failed to return for a follow-up visit, CHW contact was also effective, showing an overall improvement rate of 7% (P less than .001). The results reported support the idea that individuals from the community, trained as paraprofessionals, can improve appointment keeping as well as be useful in assisting in screening and counseling for chronic conditions within the ED. These CHWs are seen as having the additional advantage of enhancing the integration of the ED, the community, and continuing care sites. The approaches used in this study should be applicable and may serve as a model for the approach to other chronic conditions experienced in urban high-risk communities.\r"

To assess some of the factors that may be involved in these changes, this study examines a group of suicide attempters in Houston, Texas, where a large percentage of the attempts were violent. These violent attempters are compared with nonviolent attempters, and the entire population of attempters is compared with suicide attempters in New Haven, Connecticut. Finally, the two attempter populations are compared with the underlying general population demographics of two regions (Houston and New Haven). Several differences emerged between attempters in Houston and in New Haven, including larger proportions of violent attempters, male attempters, and married attempters in Houston. Demographic factors in the general populations for the two regions are different, but these differences are not directly reflected in the nature of the attempter populations. Reasons for observed differences are discussed.\r"

Cathartics usually are used in conjunction to hasten transit of the charcoal-adsorbed toxin. In the present case, a regimen of activated charcoal and magnesium citrate was used to treat a patient with theophylline poisoning. It was effective in lowering the patient's serum theophylline concentration but produced an elevated magnesium level associated with decreased responsiveness, confusion, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. Magnesium citrate may not be the optimal cathartic for use in gastrointestinal dialysis, at least in selected patients. Sorbitol has been shown to produce a more rapid catharsis without disturbing magnesium serum concentrations. Therefore, the use of sorbitol in place of magnesium citrate, at least in selected patients, may be preferred.\r"

Urine tested positive (small) for acetone within three hours of ingestion using Acetest urine testing tablets (Ames Labs, Elkhart, IN). It was concluded that acetonemia occurs early after ingestion of isopropyl alcohol and increases as serum isopropyl alcohol concentrations decline. In addition, acetonuria may be qualitatively measured by three hours postingestion with rapid urine screening tests and may remain positive for 24 hours.\r"

Mortality was 10%. Onset of seizures was within 1.5 hours of admission in all but two patients. Both patients with seizures occurring later than 1.5 hours had also ingested ethanol. Antecedent mental status did not predict the occurrence of seizures; 23% of seizures occurred when patients were alert. The majority of patients (25 of 30) had one or two brief (less than 2 minute), self-limited, generalized, tonic/clonic seizures that terminated without anticonvulsant therapy. Six patients had prolonged or repetitive seizures. Most seizures, even when multiple or sustained, had no sequela. However, four patients developed marked cardiovascular deterioration immediately following seizures, with hypotension and ventricular tachycardia or bradyarrhythmias. All four had a QRS duration greater than 200 msec at some time during their hospitalization. It is concluded that most seizures associated with cyclic antidepressant toxicity occur soon after admission, are brief, and terminate without specific anticonvulsant therapy. Even when brief, however, seizures may occasionally lead to abrupt cardiovascular deterioration and death. It is not clear which patients are at risk for severe cardiovascular complications.\r"
