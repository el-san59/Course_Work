  ".W": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell walls are likely to contain critical T cell Ag capable of inducing protective immunity against the development of tuberculosis in animal models. Therefore, we characterized cell wall-associated Ag that stimulate T lymphocytes in tuberculosis patients and clinically well tuberculin-positive individuals. A protein-peptidoglycan complex isolated from the M. tuberculosis cell wall had potent immunologic activity, evoking PBMC proliferative responses similar to those induced by sonicated whole M. tuberculosis. In order to characterize the immunoreactive protein determinants associated with the protein-peptidoglycan complex, T cell lines were established to cell wall Ag and used to probe M. tuberculosis proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. These T cell lines proliferated primarily to protein Ag of 10, 19, 23, 28, 30, 40 to 50, and 65 kDa. Cell wall-reactive T cell clones that recognized the 10-, 23-, 28-, and 30-kDa proteins as single bands on SDS-PAGE did so under reducing and nonreducing conditions, suggesting that these are not proteolytic fragments or subunits of larger protein aggregates. We propose that these protein monomers, when post-translationally complexed with peptidoglycan, are the key ingredients of the immunogenic protein-peptidoglycan complex. In order to assess the relationship of the cell wall-associated Ag to those secreted proteins from \"early culture filtrates\" of actively growing M. tuberculosis recently implicated in eliciting protective immunity, cell wall-reactive T cell clones were tested for their ability to recognize early culture filtrates. Results revealed that at least three proteins shared with the cell wall complex are contained within early culture filtrates. Our data indicate that antigenic determinants associated with the protein-peptidoglycan complex of the M. tuberculosis cell wall may be involved in protective immunity and hence are potential candidates for inclusion in an effective antituberculosis vaccine.\r"

Although the formation of these glycopeptides could account for the humoral immune responses characteristic of bacterial peptidoglycans, their formation does not account for the cellular-mediated immune responses observed for water-in-oil emulsions of peptidoglycan or for lipophilic derivatives of glycopeptide fragments thereof. Therefore, the processing of peptidoglycan by macrophages was reexamined to establish whether the lipophilic derivative of any peptidoglycan-derived glycopeptide was formed. The experiments were performed by incubating B. subtilis cell walls radiolabeled in muramic acid, glucosamine, alanine, glutamic acid, and diaminopimelic acid residues in the presence of the macrophage-like cell line RAW264. The crude lipid fraction derived from the macrophages was further fractionated and analyzed, revealing the presence of two lipophilic glycopeptides that contained glucosamine, muramic acid, and alanine of bacterial origin.\r"

  ".U": "90010148\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined the influence of self-Ag on TCR expression and specificity in the immune response to the Ag pigeon cytochrome c. Previous work has shown that most Ek-restricted cytochrome c-specific T cells from B10 background mice express TCR alpha beta-heterodimers encoded by V beta 3 and V alpha 11 genes, but that T cells expressing V beta 3 proteins are eliminated due to self-tolerance in Mls-2a mouse strains. Thus, EK-restricted cytochrome c-specific T cells from Mls-2a mice fail to express any V beta 3. In the current study the influence of self-MHC and non-MHC Ag on TCR usage in the immune response to cytochrome c was further examined. First, it was demonstrated that the absence of V beta 3 expression in Mls-2a mice does not alter Ir gene function. Specifically, Mls-2a/Eb haplotype V beta 3- [C3H.SW x B10.A(5R)]F1 mice were high responders to cytochrome c despite the fact that previous structure function analyses have shown a very close correlation between Eb-restricted cytochrome c recognition and V beta 3 expression. This demonstration of the plasticity of TCR expression suggests that relatively few Ir gene defects result from tolerance induced by self-Ag. We also examined differences in V alpha 11 expression among cytochrome c-specific T cells from various H-2k haplotype mouse strains. In particular, the low level of expression of V alpha 11 in cytochrome c-specific T cells from C57BR (H-2k) mice was shown not to be due to self-tolerance. Rather, evidence for limited strain polymorphism of V alpha 11 genes, plus the fact that cytochrome c-specific T cells from F1 hybrids between H-2k, Mls-2b identical C57BR and B10.BR mice express high levels of V alpha 11, suggested the possibility that the variable V alpha 11 usage in the cytochrome c-specific responses of these two strains reflected differences in positive selection during ontogeny by non-MHC non-Mls self-Ag.\r"

  ".W": "Our prior analyses defined the cDNA sequence on part of the CH2 domain, the complete CH3 and CH4 domains, and the 3'-untranslated region of a catfish H chain. To complete the catfish H chain mRNA sequence, a primer-extended H chain cDNA library was constructed. Analysis of this library has resulted in the definition of full-length clones encoding a 61-bp 5' untranslated region, a 51-bp leader sequence, the V region and the complete CH1 and CH2 domains. The high similarity defined with other vertebrate V regions readily allowed the catfish sequence to be divided into FR and CDR regions. Sequence comparisons with mammalian VH and JH genes strongly suggest that the catfish V region is the product of multiple genes. Using a catfish VH cDNA probe, at least 25 different genomic VH members were defined. Because this probe does not hybridize with other full-length H chain cDNA clones, additional VH families will likely be defined in catfish. Phylogenetic sequence comparisons of the catfish C region domains indicated that the CH1 and CH4 were the most highly conserved. In addition several important features were defined in genomic Southern blot analyses of catfish DNA. Gene titration experiments established that the catfish CH gene is represented by a single genomic copy. This finding provides clear evidence that the genomic organization of H chain genes in catfish must be different from that defined in sharks and suggests that the phylogeny of single copy CH genes may have been established at the level of the bony fishes. It is also likely that there is an additional CH gene in catfish. This gene is also represented by a single genomic copy, and based upon its relative signal intensity when compared with the known CH gene it appears to share higher similarity with the known CH1 domain than it does with the CH2 domain.\r"

  ".W": "The fetal VH gene repertoire was shown previously to be characterized by overrepresentation of D-proximal families, VH 7183 and VH Q52, compared with adult bone marrow B cells in which VH genes were expressed in a more stochastic fashion. To determine the underlying mechanisms of these findings, adult vs fetal progenitors were placed in the same supportive microenvironment and the resulting B lineage cells analyzed for VH gene family expression. The supportive microenvironment was provided by established adult bone marrow stromal cell layers. In this way the relative importance of environmental vs genetic influences could be determined. The fetal B cells and pre-B cells that developed on adult stromal cells maintained a fetal-like VH gene family repertoire with preference for D-proximal families VH 7183 and Q52. In contrast, adult cultured B cells maintained the adult-like repertoire with predominance of the largest family VH J558. Only after long-term incubation was there a change in the expression of particular VH gene families. These findings suggest that the D-proximal VH gene family preference observed early in ontogeny is associated more with the inherent genetic potential of B cell progenitors that predominate during fetal life and less with environmental influences.\r"

We used in situ hybridization with 35S-labeled ssRNA probes to detect VH expression in individual spleen cells. Cells were taken from unmanipulated animals, and were not stimulated in vitro. This approach allows analysis of VH usage among only those B cells which have undergone activation in vivo, while minimizing the potential for skewing in vitro. We compared usage of the 3' 7183 and Q52 families with the more 5' J558 family in adult NZB, MRL-lpr/lpr, and nonautoimmune NIH Swiss mice. VH utilization in the autoimmune strains was proportionate to VH family size, and was not biased toward the 3' families when compared with the Swiss repertoire. Moreover, 3' skewing did not develop in NZB mice with increasing age. Thus, systemic autoimmunity is not associated with impaired normalization of the adult repertoire away from the 3' bias of early ontogeny. Instead, our data support a stochastic model for VH gene usage in the activated B cells and plasma cells of adult lupus mice.\r"

In addition, because little is known about the relative use of the various V kappa gene families in an immune response, adult B cells from several different strains of mice were analyzed. This was accomplished by stimulating B cells with the polyclonal activator, LPS. Activated cells were then analyzed for V kappa gene family expression at the single cell level by in situ hybridization using radiolabeled V kappa gene probes. It was found that all V kappa gene families tested were represented in the LPS-induced adult repertoire with V kappa 1, V kappa 4,5 and V kappa 19 being expressed to the largest degree in all strains tested. The LPS-induced adult V kappa gene family repertoire was then compared to the fetal repertoire and some differences were observed. In particular, a lower proportion of fetal B cells expressed V kappa 1 and a higher proportion of fetal B cells expressed V kappa 4,5 and V kappa 10. Importantly, compared with the adult response there was no evidence in the fetal response for an increased expression of V kappa 21, the family that maps closest to J kappa,C kappa. This is in contrast to what has been shown previously with H chain V region exons in which there was a clear preference for the VH gene families that mapped closest to DH.\r"

This indicates that similar to tyrosinase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, an enzyme responsible for pheomelanogenesis, is highly concentrated in coated vesicles after its maturation in Golgi associated endoplasmic reticulum (GERL). Furthermore, in the pre- and post-dopaquinone melanogenic pathway, coated vesicles convert dopachrome to colorless indole compounds more quickly than in premelanosomes because of their higher dopachrome conversion factor activity. Melanosomes have been found to exhibit indole conversion factor activity, while coated vesicles show indole blocking factor activity. In moderately tyrosinase-rich premelanosomes, the levels of dopachrome conversion factor and indole blocking factor are lower than in coated vesicles or melanosomes. High levels of indole blocking factor in coated vesicles may indicate why melanin polymer formation does not occur there in vivo despite their high tyrosinase activity.\r"

All plaque lesions employed in this study showed clinically similar appearance. Histologically, all the biopsy specimens showed epidermotropism and the dermal infiltration of mononuclear cells including atypical cells. Histochemically, the majority of the infiltrated cells had surface markers of helper T cells. DNA extracted from skin lesions, peripheral lymphocytes, and lymph nodes revealed that the monoclonal expansion of T cells was different among patients and lesions. DNA extracted from the two skin lesions of case 1 revealed a clonal expansion of T cells. The rearranged bands persisted for about 1 year. In contrast, all lesions from cases 3-7 showed no rearranged band. Interestingly, three lesions from case 2 showed mixed type results, i.e., the monoclonal expansion of T cells was detected in one lesion but not in the other two lesions. Time course study of case 2 revealed that the same rearranged band became detectable in all three skin lesions and a lymph node about 1 year later. These results suggest that in plaque lesions of mycosis fungoides, there are various stages of detectable monoclonality of infiltrating cells, although the clinical appearance of the plaques was similar, and that the variety of monoclonality may reflect the long clinical course of this disease.\r"

Also elevated levels of palmitic acid, stearic acid and omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid derived from phospholipid were observed.

In 85 serum samples obtained randomly from families in El Gazairy (population 1,310), antibody to SmW68 (determined by ELISA) was found to increase significantly with age, reaching a plateau at 15-19 y, 1-5 y after peak prevalence and intensity of infection. Among infected individuals (n = 54), antibody response showed a significant inverse correlation (r = -.28, P less than .04) with intensity of infection. In isotype analysis, a higher IgM but not IgG response was significantly associated with low parasite burden. These studies demonstrate that significant antibody response to SmW68 could occur in chronically infected humans. Whether parasite burdens suppress circulating levels of antibody to SmW68 or whether enhanced antibody response to SmW68 represents acquired protective humoral immunity remains to be determined.\r"

Only 6 (50%) of 12 cases (21.7%-78.3%, 95% CI) had positive lethal factor titers; all controls were negative. At a cutoff of greater than or equal to 1:32 for antibodies to capsule, 11 (91.7%) of 12 (76.1%-100%, 95% CI) were positive; 16 (88.9%) of 18 controls (74.5%-100%, 95% CI) were negative. These data suggest that the EITB for detection of antibody to PA, and ELISA for detection of anticapsule antibodies are both sensitive for the retrospective diagnosis of anthrax. Both tests were specific, but EITB may be more so than ELISA.\r"

  ".W": "We have compared the relative antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects of the very low molecular weight heparin CY222 with standard unfractionated heparin (SH) in a baboon model of platelet-dependent thrombosis. Thrombus formation was induced by placement of a thrombogenic device in an exteriorized femoral arteriovenous shunt under conditions of intermediate-shear blood flow. The device consisted of a collagen-coated cannular segment positioned proximal to two regions of expanded diameter exhibiting disturbed flow and stasis. Thrombus formation was measured in real time by indium 111-labeled platelet imaging. The collagen-coated surface accumulated thrombi composed largely of platelets, and the regions of disturbed flow were morphologically rich in fibrin and red cells. SH and CY222 were administered by continuous infusion for 1 hour. Although both heparin preparations abolished thrombus formation in the low-shear fibrin-rich regions at plasma levels less than 0.5 anti-Xa U/ml, platelet deposition onto the collagen surface was not reduced by either SH or CY222 at that dosage. These findings were consistent with previously observed therapeutic benefits of this level of anti-Xa activity in venous, but not arterial, thrombosis. Platelet deposition on the collagen was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by both SH and CY222 administered at doses between 1 and 5 anti-Xa U/ml. It is important to note that although heparin preparations produced profound and equivalent antithrombotic effects for platelet-dependent thrombus formation at comparable levels of anti-Xa activity, SH prolonged both the coagulation time and the bleeding time substantially more than did CY222.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

ANP was present in all of the CSF samples from 45 patients (1.7 +/- 0.6 pmol/L, mean +/- SD). CSF ANP levels were not related to the underlying central nervous diseases of the patients, to the presence or the absence of consciousness disturbance, or to CSF osmolalities in individual patients. In 35 patients, the mean ANP concentration in CSF corresponded to 27% of that in plasma, and there was no significant correlation between ANP concentrations in each paired sample. When ANP in pooled CSF was extracted by anti-ANP-agarose and analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), multiple peaks of ANP were found. One of the major ANP peaks was identified as ANP-(103-126) on the basis of its retention time on HPLC and the specificity of the antiserum used in the radioimmunoassay; however, none of other peaks coeluted with ANP-(99-126), ANP-(101-126), ANP-(102-126), ANP-(103-125), or ANP-(105-126). We conclude from these results that ANP is present in human CSF that is differently processed from ANP in the cardiac atrium.\r"

Mean plasma levels of CGRP were 70.3 +/- 16.5 (mean +/- SE) pmol l-1 at the start of treatment, it increased to 85.3 +/- 17.6 pmol l-1 during ultrafiltration and to 114.5 +/- 25.3 pmol l-1 during dialysis. Systolic blood pressure decreased during haemodialysis. Plasma levels of CGRP were negatively correlated to systolic blood pressure before and at the end of dialysis, and changes in plasma levels of CGRP were strongly correlated to changes in systolic blood pressure. The increase in CGRP levels was not correlated to the fluid removal, toxin removal or changes in osmolality. The increase in plasma levels of CGRP observed during dialysis may be an important cause of dialysis induced vasodilatation and fall in blood pressure.\r"

Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was the strongest independent predictor of pulmonary arterial plasma ANF, whereas cardiac index best predicted aortic plasma ANF. Both pulmonary and aortic plasma ANF correlated with systolic and diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and cardiac index. Left atrial volume index and left ventricular mass index did not correlate with systemic arterial plasma ANF whereas a positive linear correlation between left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and ANF could be demonstrated (r = 0.61, P less than 0.01). Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was the most important independent predictor of systemic arterial plasma ANF. Systemic arterial plasma ANF might be a simple marker of left ventricular dilatation in patients with heart disease.\r"

Infection of the nervous system is associated with a transient, intense mononuclear meningoencephalitis and immunemediated loss of BDV-infected neurons. The identification of BDV antigen in neurons and the accompanying immunologically-specific lysis of these cells led to the prediction that the CNS would be virus-free after the animal had recovered from encephalitis. However, BDV infectivity and antigen persist for the lifetime of the animal. It appeared, therefore, that other neural cells might be hosts for viral replication and provide a reservoir for the virus. Morphological criteria were used to identify astrocytes and Schwann cells which expressed BDV antigens in vivo. Borna disease virus (BDV) infected astrocytes were identified by double labeling tissue sections with combined cell-specific and BDV-specific antibodies in an avidin-biotin immunocytochemical assay. Examination of serial I micrometer-thick cryosections of hippocampus and sciatic nerve preparations revealed several cells that expressed both glial and BDV antigens. Infectious virus was recovered from cultures of Schwann cells from infected rats. Borna disease virus-infected glial elements persisted beyond the period of inflammation and massive neuronal destruction, and represented a major class of infected cells during chronic disease.\r"

  ".W": "When cultured malignant cells derived from rat gliomas (C6 and 9L) and human gliomas (A-172 and T98G) were treated for 4 hours with 1 to 80 microns nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) or 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), a dose-dependent inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis occurred. In a series of three experiments for each cell line, 40 microM NDGA suppressed 3H-thymidine incorporation in the rat and human glioma lines to an average of less than 3.1% and 5.6% of control uptake (counts per minute), respectively. Incubation with a higher concentration of ETYA (80 microM) resulted in inhibition of rat and human DNA synthesis to less than 53% and 62% of control levels, respectively. This inhibition was not associated with any loss of cell viability, as judged by trypan blue exclusion studies. Prolonged incubation (for 72 hours) of the rat and human glioma cells with NDGA markedly decreased cell proliferation with no loss of cell viability. The inhibition of human glioma cell division by NDGA was rapidly reversible after incubation for 24 hours and at least partially reversible after incubation for 96 hours. It is concluded that the inhibitors of eicosanoid biosynthesis, NDGA and (to a lesser extent) ETYA, reduce in vitro cell proliferation in two glioma lines from both the rat and human. Since neither indomethacin nor acetylsalicylic acid altered DNA synthesis in these cell lines, this implicates the lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism as important positive modulators in glioma cell division. These findings warrant further study in an in vivo system.\r"

  ".W": "This study tested the hypothesis that ischemia-reperfusion injury initiated by the superoxide anion radical is a major component of postdecompression hypoperfusion and cerebral edema, and could be attenuated by superoxide dismutase (SOD). A supratentorial extradural balloon was placed in 20 fasting, lightly anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs and inflated in 0.5-ml increments (0.07 ml/sec) at 15-minute intervals. The end-point of balloon expansion was the onset of an isoelectric electroencephalogram, near-arrest of hemispheric cerebral blood flow (CBF) (measured by H2 clearance), and the appearance of a suprainfratentorial intracranial pressure gradient, which was held for 15 minutes. The in vivo development of brain edema was detected by measuring brain elastic response (BER) extradurally, and was correlated with postmortem measurement of brain water content (gravimetry); blood-brain barrier integrity was tested by Evans blue dye given after the insult. After decompression, the dogs were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: Group I received hyperventilation (PaCO2 28 +/- 1 mm Hg, mean +/- standard deviation); Group II received furosemide (2.4 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (10 mg/kg) every 8 hours; Group III received 20% mannitol in a 1.4-gm/kg bolus plus furosemide, 0.5 mg/kg; and Group IV received SOD, 15,000 U/kg every 15 minutes for 3 hours. At 4 hours of decompression Group IV had significantly greater recovery in local CBF and BER than Groups I, II, and III (p less than 0.05). The 24-hour survival rate was 20% for Group I, 60% for Group II, 80% for Group III, and 100% for Group IV. The survival rate appeared to correlate with a variable degree of postmortem intraparenchymal hemorrhages, blood-brain barrier disruption, and moderate to severe brain edema for Groups I, II, and III. In contrast, Group IV had the least brain edema (p less than 0.05) and Evans blue dye extravasation (p less than 0.05) and the fewest intraparenchymal hemorrhages. These data support the hypothesis that, under the experimental conditions described here, the superoxide anion plays a major role in the pathophysiology of postdecompression ischemic edema.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of a consecutive series of cases before and after the reference date of implementation of the prospective payment system (PPS). SETTING: Academic, tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: 181 patients 69 years of age or older admitted with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or DRG codes for hip fracture. RESULTS: Length of stay was shorter by 1.37 days in the post-PPS era (p = 0.05). Poorer discharge ambulation was found in the post-PPS group (p = 0.089). At one year, differences in ambulation and nursing home residence were found to be related not to the implementation of PPS, but rather to the nursing home to which the patient was discharged. Patients discharged to a facility with active physical rehabilitation were less likely to remain institutionalized (p = 0.0025) than those in \"ordinary\" nursing homes and ambulated more independently (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The PPS did not have a significant long-term impact on hip fracture outcome. Post-hospital care may be of crucial importance to the future quality of life of hip fracture patients.\r"

Histopathologically, there was an increase in vascularity and strong methyl pyronine-positive cellularity around the margins of the perforations. A young, loose, collagenous tissue lined the lateral margins of the perforated discs. Increased fibrous tissue content of the synovial subintimal territorial matrix and osteochondroid metaplasia were also seen. Severe synovial hyperplasia was visible in all joint recesses, but was greatest within those associated with displaced discs. There was patchy distribution of acidic glycoproteins, especially in the lateral parts of the perforated discs. As in the animal studies, human TMJ disc perforation was associated with a vigorous synovial reaction that was seen to form lateral bridges along the margins.\r"

The new DRG prospective \"all payor system\" is in effect at our hospital. Analysis of 12,771 pediatric patients by payer (Medicaid and commercial insurance such as Blue Cross) in these DRGs for a 3-year period demonstrated that, as a group, pediatric patients with more comorbidities generated higher total hospital costs, a longer hospital length of stay, a greater percentage of procedures per patient, financial risk under DRG payment, more outliers (expensive patients), and a higher mortality rate than pediatric patients in the same DRGs with fewer comorbidities. This study confirms major inequities in DRG prospective hospital payment for many pediatric patients.\r"

  ".W": "The reaction of cerebral blood flow to acute changes in arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) and mean arterial blood pressure was determined in 57 preterm infants supported by mechanical ventilation (mean gestational age 30.1 weeks) during the first 48 hours of life. All infants had normal brain sonograms at the time of the investigation. In each infant, global cerebral blood flow was determined by xenon-133 clearance two to five times within a few hours at different levels of PaCO2. Changes in PaCO2 followed adjustments of the ventilator settings. Arterial oxygen pressure was intended to be kept constant, and mean arterial blood pressure fluctuated spontaneously between measurements. The data were analyzed by stepwise multiple regression, with changes in global cerebral blood flow, PaCO2, mean arterial blood pressure, and postnatal age or intracranial hemorrhage used as variables. In infants with persistently normal brain sonograms, the global cerebral blood flow-carbon dioxide reactivity was markedly lower during the first day of life (mean 11.2% to 11.8%/kPa PaCO2) compared with the second day of life (mean 32.6/kPa PaCO2), and pressure-flow autoregulation was preserved. Similarly, global cerebral blood flow-carbon dioxide reactivity and pressure-flow autoregulation were present in infants in whom mild intracranial hemorrhage developed after the study. In contrast, global cerebral blood flow reactivity to changes in PaCO2 and mean arterial blood pressure was absent in infants in whom ultrasonographic signs of severe intracranial hemorrhage subsequently developed. These infants also had about 20% lower global cerebral blood flow before hemorrhage, in comparison with infants whose sonograms were normal, a finding that suggests functional disturbances of cerebral blood flow regulation. Several perinatal factors were tested, but only birth after abruptio placentae was related to subsequent periventricular hemorrhage (p = 0.037).\r"

  ".W": "Continuous perfusion manometry was performed in 31 preterm and term infants to assess the influence of gestational age on small intestinal motility. Gestational ages ranged from 27 to 42 weeks. All 8 term infants had interdigestive cycles that included all three phases. Only 4 of 23 preterm infants had complete interdigestive cycles. The remaining 19 preterm infants had only periods of motor quiescence and nonpropagating contractions. In term infants the interdigestive cycle was significantly shorter and the amplitude of phase 3 activity was significantly greater (p less than 0.01); velocity and duration of phase 3 activity were similar in both groups of infants. Rhythmic nonpropagating activity, or clusters, made up more than 60% of the phase 2 activity in both term and preterm infants. Although clusters did not propagate across three or more leads, approximately 25% of cluster activity was propagated across two leads. The duration of total cluster activity was similar for all gestational ages, but the frequency of clusters decreased and the mean duration of individual clusters increased with gestational age (both p less than 0.01). The amplitude of individual pressure peaks in clusters and phase 3 increased significantly with gestational age (p less than 0.03 and p less than 0.01, respectively). The motility index also increased with gestational age (p less than 0.02). We conclude that small intestinal motility is more immature in preterm infants than in term infants. Furthermore, cluster activity, which increases in duration and amplitude with gestational age, may be an immature form of phase 3 activity. These data and techniques will provide neonatologists with a direct way of tracking preterm intestinal motor function to provide more appropriate enteral nutrition.\r"

This study shows that the effects of CGRP given intrathecally (i.t.) appear to result from calcium modulation. Evidence for this hypothesis is the parallel shift to the right in the dose-effect curves of both i.t. calcium and i.t. A23187 (a calcium ionophore) by i.t. CGRP, and the enhancement by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid of the ability of CGRP to antagonize morphine-induced antinociception. The CGRP-induced modulation of spinal calcium appears to occur in opiate-sensitive pathways as well as nonopioid pathways, as evidenced by parallel shifts to the right in the dose-response curves of i.c.v. and i.t. morphine in either the tail-flick or the hot-plate test and nonparallel shifts in the dose-response curve of s.c. morphine in the tail-flick test. CGRP attenuates the antinociceptive effect of the delta receptor-specific ligand [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (i.t.), but enhances the antinociceptive effect of the kappa ligand, U50, 488H. CGRP does not appear to interact directly with the opiate receptor because it does not mimic the activity of naloxone i.t. However, CGRP-induced alterations of calcium in opiate-sensitive spinal pathways appear to produce subtle modulation of opiate antinociception without direct opiate receptor interaction.\r"

Squirrel monkeys responded under a second-order fixed-interval schedule of consequent i.v. drug injection, and dose-effect curves were established by determining stable rates of responding maintained by saline and a range of doses of each drug. Cocaine (0.01-0.56 mg/kg/injection), bupropion (0.1-3.0 mg/kg/injection), 1-(2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl)-4-(3- phenylpropyl)piperazine-(0.03-1.0 mg/kg/injection), methylphenidate (0.01-0.3 mg/kg/injection) and nomifensine (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) maintained comparable rates and patterns of responding in all subjects, whereas mazindol (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) maintained self-administration behavior in only half the monkeys studied. The present results in conjunction with those of previous studies in squirrel monkeys reveal a close correspondence between the relative potencies of cocaine and related drugs for maintaining i.v. self-administration and for increasing rates of schedule-controlled responding, suggesting that the reinforcing and psychomotor-stimulant effects of the drugs are mediated similarly. The potency relations observed in the present study also agree generally with those observed for displacement of specifically bound [3H]cocaine in monkey caudate-putamen suggesting that the reinforcing effects of cocaine involve its actions at specific recognition sites in brain.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of chronic ethanol treatment, and its withdrawal on the binding of ligands to the benzodiazepine binding sites of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex, was investigated in C57BL/6J mice spinal cord cultured neurons. Chronic ethanol (50 mM) treatment increased the specific binding of inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine binding sites, without affecting the binding of agonist or antagonist to this site. Thus, chronic ethanol exposure of the neurons increased the binding of [3H] Ro 15-4513 [ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5-alpha][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate] and methyl-1-beta carboline-3-carboxylate [( 3H]beta-CCM), but not the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]Ro 15-1788 [ethyl-8-fluro-5-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-OxO-4H-imidazo[1,5-alpha][1, 4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate]. This increase was due to an increase in the number of binding sites for Ro 15-4513 and beta-CCM, and not due to a change in receptor affinity. The increase was observed as early as after a 12-hr exposure of the neurons with ethanol, and remained elevated at 24-hr withdrawal, returning to control values at 48-hr withdrawal. These results further strengthen the notion that Ro 15-4513 and related inverse agonists binding site on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex may be involved in ethanol-s behavioral, biochemical and pharmacological effects which are mediated via GABAA receptor system. The significance of the enhanced binding sites for Ro 15-4513 and beta-CCM in the actions of ethanol, tolerance and withdrawal is discussed.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to clarify the pharmacological basis of the inhibitory effect of ASA on renal cell cyclooxygenase in the rat. ASA was given to rats either i.v. or p.o. at doses ranging from 10 to 200 mg/kg. After both i.v. and p.o. administration ASA was rapidly detected in plasma as intact molecule. The kinetics were of a dose-dependent type with a disproportionate increase in plasma level increasing the dose. Plasma salicylic acid (SA) concentrations peaked after ASA with a precursor product relationship. ASA levels in kidney homogenates were also determined after i.v. and p.o. ASA. Whereas after i.v. administration ASA was detected in the kidney as intact molecule, no ASA was detected in the kidney after p.o. administration. SA was measurable in the kidney after both i.v. and p.o. ASA with a time course which paralleled the plasma concentrations. Results of isolated kidneys perfused with a medium containing ASA and of kidney homogenates exposed to ASA \"in vitro\" indicate that ASA is rapidly converted to SA by kidney tissue enzymes. After ASA hydrolysis SA accumulates in the kidney and may protect renal cyclooxygenase from the inhibitor effect of ASA.\r"

This was studied in vitro in mouse peritoneal macrophages infected with L. monocytogenes, as well as in vivo in experimental L. monocytogenes infection in mice. Two types of liposomes, a relatively fluid type, consisting of cholesterol-phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidylserine (5:4:1), and a less fluid type, consisting of cholesterol-distearoylphosphatidylcholine-dipalmitoylphosphatidylglyc erol (10:10:1), were used. The uptake of both types of liposomes by macrophages in vitro was similar. However, the rate of intracellular degradation appeared to be dependent on the lipid composition. A correlation was found between the relatively slow degradation of the less fluid liposomes and a delayed intracellular release of the encapsulated ampicillin, as reflected in absent or delayed intracellular killing of L. monocytogenes in vitro. The results obtained in vitro were confirmed by the observations in vivo. Slow degradation of the less fluid liposomes in vivo resulted in a decrease in the therapeutic effect of the antibiotic.\r"

The kinetics of immunoreactive ANF (IR-ANF) were first-order after a bolus of up to 300 ng/kg. Compared to the bolus, prolonged infusion of ANF produced a significant reduction in the systemic clearance of IR-ANF, from 132 to 59 and 70 ml/min/kg (P less than .0001) for the 81 +/- 8 ng/min/kg (x140 min) and 126 +/- 6 ng/min/kg (x480 min) infusion rates, respectively; however, the distribution of ANF was not affected. During the infusion of ANF, there was a marked decrease in mean arterial pressure and renal plasma flow, whereas the effects on renal excretion of water and sodium parameters were minimal. The change in hemodynamics was accompanied by a rebound increase in plasma renin activity. It is concluded that the kinetics of IR-ANF are zero-order after a prolonged infusion, secondary to a fall in the systemic clearance of ANF and that in this animal model, and at the doses used, this peptide only elicited hemodynamic effects, possibly related to the activation of counter-regulatory mechanisms.\r"

The collective concentration of these G proteins was measured by pertussis toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation and decreased from 1.5 pmol of [32P]ADP-ribose/mg of protein in the fetal heart to 0.5 pmol of [32P]ADP-ribose/mg of protein in 21-day postpartum and older animals in a nonlinear pattern. The muscarinic receptor density diminished 2-fold from 400 fmol/mg in 1-day-old neonate to 200 fmol/mg of protein in adult hearts in a linear manner. The receptor affinity for the agonist oxotremorine and the effect of guanine nucleotide on that affinity were monitored in heart preparations of the various ages. The IC50 value for oxotremorine/[3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate competition curves in the absence or presence of guanine nucleotide increased gradually with age. Modeling of the competition curves from 1-day-old neonate and adult preparations suggested the receptor has two oxotremorine affinity states in both age groups but the ability of guanine nucleotide to shift receptors from the higher affinity state increases with age. [3H] Oxotremorine binding to the higher affinity state had KD values of 95 and 170 pM in neonate and adult heart preparations. The concentration of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate which caused 50% displacement of [3H]oxotremorine binding was 1.3 and 0.22 microM in neonate and adult tissue. These results suggest that although the quantity of the G proteins and muscarinic receptors diminish with development, the sensitivity of the G protein:muscarinic receptor complex to guanine nucleotide increases.\r"

Two sequential infusions of hypertonic sodium chloride into the renal artery for 10 min were separated by 90 min, and various interventions were introduced before the second hypertonic saline infusion. In the first group of dogs, the first infusion of hypertonic saline resulted in a significant decrease in renal blood flow from 234 +/- 36 to 199 +/- 31 ml/min, but when atriopeptin III (APIII) was infused into the renal artery at 3 x 10(-10) mol/min, the repeat infusion of hypertonic saline resulted in a significant increase in blood flow from 221 +/- 28 to 269 +/- 35 ml/min that was maintained throughout the 10 min of hypertonic saline. In the second group of dogs only the vehicle for APIII was infused during the second hypertonic saline infusion. In these dogs, renal blood flow decreased significantly the first time from 201 +/- 17 to 170 +/- 16 ml/min, and the second time from 232 +/- 22 to 177 +/- 20 ml/min. In a third group of dogs, the vasodilator sodium nitroprusside, a stimulator of smooth muscle soluble guanylate cyclase, was infused into the renal artery during the second hypertonic saline infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The direct cardioprotective efficacy of the potassium channel activators pinacidil and cromakalim was determined in isolated globally ischemic rat hearts. Isolated buffer-perfused rat hearts were subjected to 25 min of ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion. These hearts were pretreated with 1 to 100 microM pinacidil, 1 to 7 microM cromakalim or vehicle. Pinacidil resulted in significant improvements in reperfusion function and cardiac compliance, though it did not significantly reduce lactate dehydrogenase release at any concentration. The protective effects of pinacidil were greatest at a 10 microns concentration and were slightly diminished at higher concentrations (30 and 100 microns). Although not affecting the severity of ischemia alone, 10 microM glyburide (potassium channel blocker) completely reversed the protective effects of pinacidil on reperfusion function and compliance. Cromakalim (7 microM) resulted in a greater than 50% improvement in reperfusion function and compliance and unlike pinacidil significantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase release by approximately 50%. At 1 microM, glyburide alone did not significantly affect the severity of ischemia but reversed the protective effects of cromakalim. Not only did glyburide reverse the protective effects of cromakalim, it resulted in a worsening of ischemia compared to vehicle, an effect not seen with glyburide alone. Thus, both pinacidil and cromakalim appear to have direct cardioprotective efficacy, though some differences between them may be possible. The mechanism of their protective effects appears to be via potassium channel opening as the potassium channel blocker glyburide reverses the protective effect of these compounds. Intracellular electrophysiological studies showed that ischemia-induced depolarization was reversed with cromakalim, which increased the resting potential nearly back to preischemic levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two abortions occurred in this group during clomiphene therapy, while five pregnancies (four live births and one spontaneous abortion) occurred during hMG-S therapy. The ovulation rates were similar for hMG-S (89%) and clomiphene (91%) therapy, but the frequency of a normal ovulatory cycle was significantly greater (P = .026) for hMG-S therapy (71%) than for clomiphene therapy (57%). The midluteal mean serum progesterone level was lower and the mean luteal length shorter in the cycles with less than 130 ng/mL/d of total integrated luteal progesterone. The postcoital test results showed better cervical mucus, with increased mucus volume and better fluidity and spinnbarkeit, in hMG-S cycles than in clomiphene cycles. It appears that hMG-S treatment can improve ovarian function and achieve successful pregnancy in patients with luteal phase defects who fail to produce a live birth during clomiphene treatment.\r"

The irrigants containing glycine produced hyperkalemia and usually prickling and burning skin sensations and slight nausea. The severity of the symptoms apparently correlated to the blood ammonia level, which increased significantly after the glycine but not after the mannitol infusions. With 5% mannitol, there was a pronounced transient increase of the blood volume and a prolonged hyponatremia. There were no differences between the irrigants in respect to their effects on blood pressure and urine excretion. Ethanol caused no adverse effects and allowed the fluid supplementation to be followed by expired breath tests.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of chronic ischemia on glucose metabolism of the rabbit urinary bladder was studied. Unilateral ischemia was produced by ligation of one of the two vesical arteries which supply the rabbit bladder. Two weeks after the operation, the in vitro glucose metabolism of normal bladder tissue was compared to the glucose metabolism of tissue isolated from both the ischemic side and contralateral (non-ischemic) side of the ischemic bladder. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) ischemic and contralateral side bladder tissues contained less glycogen than normal; 2) glucose utilization was higher in the ischemic and contralateral side tissues; 3) ischemic and contralateral side tissues incorporated more glucose into lactate and produced more total lactate than normal tissues; 4) whereas contralateral side tissue produced more 14CO2 than ischemic side tissue, the ability of normal bladder tissue to form 14CO2 is significantly higher than both ischemic and contralateral side tissues; 5) the degree of reduced CO2 production correlated well with previous studies on the contractile response of smooth muscle strips isolated from the ischemic and contralateral sides, and the reduced functional ability of the in vitro whole bladder to empty; 6) histologically, smooth muscle degeneration and necrosis is only present on the ischemic side of the bladder although the contralateral side shows signs of generalized degeneration and edema. In general, we conclude that although only the ischemic tissue demonstrated major smooth muscle degeneration and necrosis, unilateral ischemia resulted in marked alterations in glucose metabolism on both the ischemic and contralateral sides.\r"

Thus, this study evaluates prospectively in adult patients without extreme volume deficit two regimens of therapy that differed exclusively in the rate of fluid infusion. In protocol 1 (12 patients), normal saline was infused at 1000 mL/h (approximately 14 mL/kg per hour) in the initial 4 hours and 500 mL/h (approximately 7 mL/kg per hour) during the subsequent 4 hours. In protocol 2 (11 patients), normal saline was infused at half the rates of protocol 1. For plasma bicarbonate level, the increment from admission levels at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours after admission was greater with protocol 2 at all times, attaining a statistically significant difference at 4 hours (3.7 vs 0.7 mmol/L) and at 24 hours (13.2 vs 8.4 mmol/L). These data support cautious restraint in the volume of fluid replacement used in the therapy of diabetic ketoacidosis, since prompt recovery, lack of any harmful effects, and a significant reduction in the overall cost of medical therapy are achieved with lower rates of saline infusion.\r"

One hundred forty-nine transplants (45%) were performed in these mortally ill patients. There was no statistically significant difference between patients with and without infection within each support group for the following: the number of in-patient days awaiting a donor heart, the number of days receiving support, the percent of patients with preoperative tracheal intubation, the length of the operation, and the percent of patients requiring reoperation for bleeding. The need for invasive methods of support (intraaortic balloon pump, left ventricular assist device, or total artificial heart) in patients awaiting heart transplantation increases the prevalence of perioperative nonviral infection. Preoperative mechanical support with a left ventricular assist device or total artificial heart significantly increases the risk of infection-related mortality.\r"

  ".U": "90013343\r", 
  ".W": "This study tests the hypothesis that metabolic support of remote \"nonischemic\" myocardium during acute infarction will reverse the trend toward cardiogenic shock. Thirty-seven dogs underwent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 50% stenosis of the circumflex coronary artery. Irreversible ventricular fibrillation developed in 11 of them. The 26 survivors were observed for up to 6 hours; global and regional left ventricular function (cardiac index, stroke work index, ultrasonic crystals) and regional blood flow (radioactive microspheres) were measured. After 2 hours, eight dogs received an intravenous infusion of glutamate/aspartate, glucose-insulin-potassium, coenzyme Q10, and 2-mercapto-propionyl-glycine for 4 hours. Five dogs received the mannitol infusion to raise serum osmolarity 30 mOsm. Four additional dogs received the intravenous substrate infusions over 4 hours without undergoing ischemia. The substrate infusion for 4 hours caused no change in regional or global cardiac function in the four control dogs. Three of nine untreated dogs died of cardiogenic shock, and progressive left ventricular power failure occurred in the six others (40% decrease in cardiac index, 50% decrease in stroke work index, p less than 0.05) because of persistent dyskinesia in the left anterior descending region (-40% of systolic shortening, p less than 0.05) and hypocontractility in the circumflex region (48% of control systolic shortening, p less than 0.05), despite normal transmural blood flow in the posterior left ventricular wall (76 ml/100 gm/min). In contrast, in treated dogs, hypercontractility recovered in the circumflex segment (138% of systolic shortening) and stroke work index rose to control levels (91%) without a change in regional blood flow. Mannitol infusion did not improve hemodynamics or avoid the development of progressive left ventricular power failure. We conclude that cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction is due, in large part, to impaired ability of \"nonischemic\" myocardium to maintain hypercontractility. This limitation can be prevented by metabolic support of viable muscle, and the data imply that intravenous substrate infusions may be helpful before definitive treatment (i.e., coronary artery bypass grafting) is undertaken.\r"

There was no identifiable relation to food or water consumption, but the risk of gastroenteritis among passengers who had shared toilet facilities was twice that of those who had a private bathroom and the rate of illness was related to the number of passengers sharing a communal restroom (ie, with one or more toilets): contaminated bathrooms may be an important vehicle for person-to-person spread of this enteric agent. In each cabin, index patients who had vomited in their cabins were more likely to have had cabinmates who subsequently became ill than were index patients who had not vomited. These epidemiological findings implicate vomitus in the transmission of viral gastroenteritis and they are consistent with the transmission of viral agents by airborne droplets or person-to-person contact. New strategies for prevention of viral gastroenteritis should include protection against environmental contamination by viruses in airborne droplets or vomitus.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past decade the clinical results of kidney transplantation have improved substantially, with much of the benefit being attributed to the introduction in late 1983 of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine. To assess the effect of cyclosporine on the use of hospital services, we studied 702 patients who received kidney transplants at the University of California, San Francisco, between July 1982 and June 1986. All services were priced in constant 1985 dollars, and multiple regression analysis was used to adjust for changing patient and hospital characteristics. The introduction of cyclosporine for patients receiving kidneys from cadavers was associated with a significantly shorter adjusted mean postoperative stay (26.4 days as compared with 37.0 for patients not taking the drug; P less than 0.0001) and lower adjusted mean hospital charges ($28,649 as compared with $37,895; P less than 0.0001), although cyclosporine was not associated with changes in the use of services by patients who received transplants from living related donors. Cyclosporine was also associated with a reduction in the use of certain ancillary services, such as laboratory tests and radiographic procedures. In patients without diabetes who received cadaver kidneys, a sequential cyclosporine regimen (in which a combination of antilymphoblast globulin, prednisone, and azathioprine was given before cyclosporine) reduced the use of hospital services even more than did a cyclosporine regimen in which the combination was not given. The results suggest that new medications, such as cyclosporine, that reduce the frequency of complications and improve outcomes may also reduce the use of hospital resources.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated a multicenter cohort of 1219 subjects with hemophilia or related disorders prospectively, focusing on 319 subjects with documented dates of seroconversion to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The incidence rate of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after seroconversion was 2.67 per 100 person-years and was directly related to age (from 0.83 in persons 1 to 11 years old up to 5.66 in persons 35 to 70 years old; Ptrend = 0.00003). The annual incidence of AIDS ranged from zero during the first year after seroconversion to 7 percent during the eighth year, with eight-year cumulative rates (+/- SE) of 13.3 +/- 5.3 percent for ages 1 to 17, 26.8 +/- 6.4 percent for ages 18 to 34, and 43.7 +/- 16.4 percent for ages 35 to 70. Serial immunologic and virologic markers (total numbers of CD4 lymphocytes, presence of serum interferon or HIV-1 p24 antigen, and low or absent serum levels of anti-p24 or anti-gp120) predicted a high risk for the subsequent development of AIDS. Adults 35 to 70 years old had a higher incidence of low CD4 counts than younger subjects (P less than or equal to 0.005), whereas adolescents had a low rate of anti-p24 loss (P = 0.0007) and subjects 1 to 17 years old had a lower incidence of AIDS after loss of anti-p24 (P = 0.03). These findings not only demonstrate that the risk of AIDS is related directly to age but also suggest that older adults are disproportionately affected during the earlier phases of HIV disease, that adolescents may have a low replication rate of HIV, and that children and adolescents may tolerate severe immunodeficiency better because they have fewer other infections or because of some unmeasured, age-dependent cofactor or immune alteration in the later phase of HIV disease.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether by treating such patients with a pasteurized factor VIII concentrate that had been heated in aqueous solution at 60 degrees C for 10 hours, HIV infection could be avoided. Eleven hemophilia centers in the Federal Republic of Germany and two in Austria identified 155 eligible patients who had been treated exclusively with pasteurized factor VIII concentrate and had not received any other blood products. Between February 1979 and December 1986 they received a total of 15,916,260 IU of pasteurized factor VIII. The United States was the source of 80 percent of the plasma from which the concentrate was made. By September 1988, these 155 patients had been screened for antibody to HIV type 1 (anti-HIV-1) with a total of 657 tests; all were negative. Sixty-seven patients were also tested once for antibody to HIV type 2 (anti-HIV-2); all these tests were negative as well. It appears that pasteurization effectively inactivates HIV, even in plasma that is likely to be highly contaminated with the virus.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is widely believed to be an autoimmune disease. Recent onset diabetics show destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells associated with a lymphocytic infiltrate (insulitis), with autoantibodies to beta-cells being found even before the onset of symptoms. Susceptibility to the disease is strongly influenced by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II polymorphism in both man and experimental animal models such as the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. As MHC class II molecules are usually associated with dominant immune responsiveness, it was surprising that introduction of a transgenic class II molecule, I-E, protected NOD mice from insulitis and diabetes. This could be explained by a change either in the target tissue or in the T cells presumed to be involved in beta-cell destruction. Recently, several studies have shown that I-E molecules are associated with ontogenetic deletion of T cells bearing antigen/MHC receptors encoded in part by certain T-cell receptor V beta gene segments. To determine the mechanism of the protective effect of I-E, we have produced cloned CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell lines from islets of recently diabetic NOD mice. These cloned lines are islet-specific and pathogenic in both I-E- and I-E+ mice. Both CD4+ and CD8+ cloned T cells bear receptors encoded by a V beta 5 gene segment, known to be deleted during development in I-E expressing mice. Our data provide, therefore, an explanation for the puzzling effect of I-E on susceptibility to diabetes in NOD mice.\r"

  ".W": "The segmentation of the Drosophila body plan depends on a hierarchy of interactions among approximately 20-25 regulatory genes that are active in the early embryo (refs 1-4; for a review see ref. 5). The gap genes have a key role in this process and are responsible for the periodic expression of certain pair-rule genes and the localized expression of several homoeotic genes. The two best characterized gap genes, hunchback (hb) and Kruppel (Kr), contain homologies with the zinc-finger DNA-binding motif, although their mode of action in the early embryo is unknown. Here we report that both of the proteins encoded by these genes possess sequence-specific DNA-binding activities, which indicates that they might regulate gene expression at the level of transcription. The binding sites of the hb gene product are related by a 10-base pair (bp) consensus sequence, G/A C/C ATAAAAAA, whereas the binding sites of the Kr gene product share a distinct 10-bp motif, AACGGGTTAA. It is possible that the hb and Kr proteins cooperatively regulate gene expression, because they are expressed in broad, overlapping gradients in the early embryo. We also provide evidence that the on/off periodicity of the pair-rule gene even-skipped (eve) involves the interaction of the hb and Kr proteins with defined eve promoter elements.\r"

  ".W": "Muscular dysgenesis in mice is a genetic disease of skeletal muscle caused by the recessive mutation mdg. Muscle fibres in affected mice are paralysed because of the failure of excitation-contraction coupling. Unlike normal myotubes in primary culture, dysgenic myotubes do not contract, either spontaneously or in response to electrical stimulation. The deficiency results from mutation of the gene for the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor, an essential sarcolemmal component both of excitation-contraction coupling and of the slow calcium-ion channel. It has recently been shown that the addition of fibroblasts from normal (but not dysgenic) mice to cultures of dysgenic myotubes can restore spontaneous contractions in a small fraction of these myotubes, but the mechanism for this 'rescue' was not determined. In principle, if fibroblast nuclei were able to incorporate into myotubes, such nuclei could then supply the missing muscle-specific gene product. We have now investigated this possibility using nuclear, cytoplasmic and plasmalemmal markers. We report that the rescue to contractile ability in genetically paralysed dysgenic muscle is mediated by the previously unrecognized ability of fibroblasts to fuse spontaneously with developing myotubes.\r"

Three homologous proteins, CD1a, b and c, have been defined serologically, and the CD1 gene locus on human chromosome 1 contains five potential CD1 genes. Analysis of the predicted amino-acid sequences of CD1 molecules reveals a low but significant level of homology to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, and, like MHC class I molecules, CD1 molecules are associated non-covalently with beta 2-microglobulin. These structural similarities to known antigen-presenting molecules, together with the expression of CD1 on cells capable of antigen presentation, suggest a role for CD1 molecules in antigen recognition by T cells. Here we demonstrate the specific recognition of CD1a by a CD4-CD8- alpha beta T-cell receptor (TCR) expressing cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) line and the specific recognition of CD1c by a CD4-CD8- gamma delta TCR CTL line. The interaction of CD1-specific CTLs with CD1+ target cells appeared to involve the CD3-TCR complex, and did not show evidence of MHC restriction. These results suggest that for a subset of T cells, CD1 molecules serve a function analogous to that of MHC class I and II molecules.\r"

Previously it has been shown that when expressed in Escherichia coli, the protein is autocatalytically processed in the periplasmic space, and that the functional protease domain accumulates extracellularly. Engineered proteins lacking the 166 amino-acid pro-region were enzymatically inactive and remained cell-associated. By independently expressing the pro- and protease domains in vivo, evidence is provided here that direct covalent linkage is not required for production of active protease. We postulate that the pro-region acts as a template to promote the folding of the protease domain into an active configuration. Our results, combined with recent experiments on the evolutionarily unrelated subtilisin E (ref. 3), suggest that the ability of the pro-region of these bacterial proteases to facilitate folding of their protease domains is not a curiosity of a single system, but may reflect a general property of extracellular bacterial serine proteases.\r"

The properties of PN-II indicate that it has a role in the regulation of certain proteases in the extracellular environment. Here we describe more of the amino-acid sequence of PN-II and its identity to the deduced sequence of the amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP). Amyloid beta-protein is present in neuritic plaques and cerebrovascular deposits in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome. A monoclonal antibody against PN-II (designated mAbP2-1) recognized PN-II in immunoblots of serum-free culture medium from human glioblastoma cells and neuroblastoma cells, as well as in homogenates of normal and Alzheimer's disease brains. In addition, mAbP2-1 stained neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease brain. PN-II was a potent inhibitor of chymotrypsin with an inhibition constant Ki of 6 x 10(-10)M. Together, these data demonstrate that PN-II and APP are probably the same protein. The regulation of extracellular proteolysis by PN-II and the deposition of at least parts of the molecule in senile plaques is consistent with previous reports that implicate altered proteolysis in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.\r"

In Drosophila, we have recently constructed heteroplasmic flies possessing both endogenous mitochondrial DNA and foreign mitochondrial DNA by intra- and interspecific transplantation of germ plasm. During the maintenance of these heteroplasmic lines, flies of D. melanogaster are produced that no longer possess their own mitochondrial DNA but retain the foreign mitochondrial DNA from D. mauritiana. .These flies are fertile and the foreign mitochondrial DNA is stably maintained in their offspring. Here we report the complete replacement of endogenous mitochondrial DNA with that from another multicellular species. Molecular and genetic analysis of this replacement in Drosophila should provide new insight into the functional interaction between nuclear and organelle genomes.\r"

  ".W": "Thymic selection of the developing T-cell repertoire occurs in immature CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes and is thought to be mediated by signals transduced by T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) molecules and possibly by CD4 and CD8 accessory molecules as well. It is not known, however, which signal-transduction mechanisms function in immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes on engagement of TCR, CD4 or CD8 molecules. In mature T cells, CD4 and CD8 molecules are each associated with the src-like protein tyrosine kinase p56 lck and signals transduced by TCR and CD4 activate tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate TCR-zeta chains and other intracellular substrates. Consequently, we examined whether tyrosine kinases could be similarly activated in immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Unexpectedly, we found that TCR-zeta chains from CD4+CD8+ thymocytes were already phosphorylated in vivo, and that dephosphorylation of this TCR subunit occurred on removal of CD4+CD8+ cells from their intrathymic environment. Rephosphorylation of TCR-zeta in cultured CD4+CD8+ thymocytes occurred rapidly in vitro, either in response to cross-linking of TCR, CD4 or CD8 by specific monoclonal antibodies, or on cell-cell contact. These observations indicate that tyrosine kinases are activated in vivo in immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes undergoing thymic differentiation and selection. They also indicate that TCR, CD4 and CD8 molecules can function in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes as signalling molecules to activate tyrosine kinases and that phosphorylated TCR-zeta serves as a marker of these signalling events.\r"

  ".W": "RNA editing is a process that results in the production of a messenger RNA with nucleotide sequences that differ from those of the template DNA, and provides another mechanism for modulating gene expression. The phenomenon was initially described in the mitochondria of protozoa. Here we report that RNA editing is also required for the correct expression of plant mitochondrial genes. It has previously been proposed that in plant mitochondria there is a departure from the universal genetic code, with CGG specifying tryptophan instead of arginine. This was because CGG codons are often found in plant mitochondrial genes at positions corresponding to those encoding conserved tryptophans in other organisms. We have now found, however, wheat mitochondrial gene sequences containing C residues that are edited to U residues in the corresponding mRNA sequences. In this way, CGG codons can be changed to UGG codons in the mRNA so that tryptophan may be encoded according to the universal genetic code. Furthermore, for each codon modification resulting from a C----U conversion that we studied, we found a corresponding change in the amino acid that was encoded. RNA editing in wheat mitochondria can thus maintain genetic information at the RNA level and as a result contribute to the conservation of mitochondrial protein sequences among plants.\r"

  ".W": "A basic principle of molecular biology is that the primary sequence of RNA faithfully reflects the primary sequence of the DNA from which it is transcribed. This concept has been challenged recently by the discovery of RNA editing, broadly defined as any process that changes the nucleotide sequence of an RNA molecule from that of the DNA template encoding it. Examples of RNA editing (see ref. 2 for review) include the insertion and deletion of uridine residues in mitochondrial messenger RNAs in kinetoplastid protozoa, the conversion of a cytidine to uridine in mammalian apolipoprotein-B mRNA, and the appearance of two non-templated guanosine residues in a paramyxovirus transcript. In these cases, RNA editing either re-tailors a non-functional transcript, producing a translatable mRNA, or modifies an already functional mRNA so that it generates a protein of altered amino-acid sequence. Here we report an editing phenomenon that involves the conversion of cytidine to uridine at multiple positions in the mRNA for subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase in wheat mitochondria. Such RNA editing provides an explanation for apparent coding anomalies in plant mitochondria.\r"

The genes for TCR beta-chains, like immunoglobulin genes, are subject to allelic exclusion. The introduction of a functional TCR-beta gene into the germline of mice prevents rearrangement of endogenous TCR-beta genes. Here we report that the introduction of a non-functional TCR-beta genes. Here we report that the introduction of a non-functional TCR-beta gene with a deletion of the major part of the variable region (delta V-TCR-beta), also inhibits endogenous TCR-beta gene rearrangement. This inhibition is mediated via the encoded protein because impairment of endogenous TCR-beta gene rearrangement is not found if a frameshift mutation is introduced into the DJ region of the delta V-TCR-beta transgene. The delta V-TCR-beta transgene can lead to two phenotypes, in which lymphoid development is perturbed. Phenotype A is characterized by a severe impairment of both T and B cell development as reflected by the complete absence of certain lymphoid organs. In phenotype B, lymphoid organs are macroscopically normal, but T cell differentiation is impeded. Virtually all thymocytes lack membrane expression of TCR-alpha beta, but nevertheless carry the CD4 and CD8 antigens (CD4+CD8+ phenotype); they do not, however, mature further. The defect in mice of phenotype B but not of phenotype A can be corrected by the introduction of a functional TCR-beta gene.\r"

Cyclosporin A, a cyclic undecapeptide and FK-506, a macrolide, although chemically distinct, inhibit similar lymphocyte activation responses. The earliest responses inhibited in the T cell seem to be the expression of early phase T cell-activation genes for interleukins 2, 3 and 4, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and gamma interferon. Although FK-506 and cyclosporin A seem to inhibit similar signal transduction processes, they do so be interacting with distinct cytosolic proteins. We report here the purification to homogeneity of a specific FK-506 binding protein that is distinct from the cyclosporin A-binding protein, cyclophilin. In addition, we show that this FK-506 binding protein, like cyclophilin, has peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity.\r"

  ".W": "The structurally novel macrolide FK506 (refs 1,2) has recently been demonstrated to have potent immunosuppressive activity at concentrations several hundredfold lower than cyclosporin A (CsA). Cyclosporin A, a cyclic peptide, has found widespread clinical use in the prevention of graft rejection following bone marrow and organ transplantation. The mechanisms of immunosuppression mediated by FK506 and CsA appear to be remarkably similar, suggesting that these unrelated structures act on a common receptor or on similar molecular targets, perhaps the CsA receptor, cyclophilin, which has recently been shown by Fischer et al. and Takahashi et al. to have cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity. We have prepared an FK506 affinity matrix and purified a binding protein for FK506 from bovine thymus and from human spleen. This FK506-binding protein (FKBP) has a relative molecular mass (Mr) of approximately 14,000(14K), a pI of 8.8-8.9, and does not cross-react with antisera against cyclophilin. The first 40 N-terminal residues of the bovine and 16 residues of the human FKBP were determined; the 16-residue fragments are identical to each other and unrelated to any known sequences. This protein catalyses the cis-trans isomerization of the proline amide in a tetrapeptide substrate and FK506 inhibits the action of this new isomerase. The FKBP and cyclophilin appear to be members of an emerging class of novel proteins that regulate T cell activation and other metabolic processes, perhaps by the recognition (and possibly the isomerization) of proline-containing epitopes in target proteins.\r"

Recently, tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) derived from recombinant deoxyribonucleic (DNA) technology has been introduced as a new thrombolytic substance. With its high affinity for fibrin-bound plasminogen and low affinity for circulating plasminogen by which a clot-selective fibrinolysis can be achieved without the danger of inducing systemic fibrinogenolysis, rtPA might be the ideal substance for the postoperative lysis of cisternal blood accumulations after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The efficacy of rtPA in preventing delayed cerebral vasospasm after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage using a single intracisternal bolus injection of this agent was investigated. With a single injection of 25 micrograms of rtPA into the cisterna magna 48 hours after the first and 6 hours after the second injection of blood in the two-hemorrhage model of cerebral vasospasm, angiographic spasm of the basilar artery was completely prevented in all animals so treated whereas in the control group severe vasospasm occurred. Autopsy studies of the experimental animals demonstrated that the subarachnoid blood clots were almost completely removed by intracisternal rtPA application. Additionally the pathomorphological signs of proliferative vasculopathy present in all animals of the control group were not demonstrable in the rtPA group. As intracisternal bolus injection of rtPA is highly efficacious in preventing angiographic as well as pathomorphological vasospasm, it is concluded that use of this thrombolytic substance might be a promising approach for pharmacological blood clot removal.\r"

Prolonged incubation periods, from months to decades, precede clinical disease. In studies on the biochemical characteristics of prions, weanling Syrian hamsters have been used extensively because they have relatively short incubation periods. In studies reported here, inoculation of neonatal hamsters significantly shortened the scrapie incubation period even further. Our results show that the scrapie incubation period in hamsters is a function of age. The interval between inoculation and death from scrapie plotted as a function of age (0 to 30 days) gave a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.86. The duration of clinical disease was also shortened in the hamsters inoculated as neonates compared with weanlings. Intraventricular injection of nerve growth factor prior to inoculation of neonates with scrapie significantly diminished the acceleration observed with scrapie alone in neonates. Histopathologic studies of brain from scrapie-inoculated neonates showed more extensive neuronal loss in the hippocampus and neocortex as well as a more profound gliosis in the caudate compared with animals inoculated as weanlings. Our results demonstrate an age-dependent acceleration of scrapie in neonatal hamsters and may provide a new experimental system for defining factors that modify the pathogenesis of prion diseases.\r"

Topical DMBA treatment produced tumor formation in pouches, but HSV-1 inoculation, alone caused no neoplastic changes. In pouch tissues receiving both DMBA application and HSV-1 inoculation, the development of initial leukoplakia and tumor has hastened and enhanced in comparison with those receiving DMBA alone. Topical DMBA application to pouch tissue induced an amplification and an increase in the expression of cellular erb-B-1 (c-erb-B-1) proto-oncogene in the epithelial tissue, whereas repeated infection with HSV-1 alone did not. Topical DMBA combined with HSV-1 inoculation, however, resulted in greater amplification and expression of c-erb-B-1 proto-oncogene in the pouch epithelial tissue compared to the DMBA alone. These data indicate that HSV-1 inoculation significantly increases the carcinogenic activity of DMBA, in part, by probably enhancing DMBA-induced amplification and expression of c-erb-B-1 proto-oncogene in hamster buccal pouch tissue.\r"

Examples of brainstem diseases affecting the facial nerve and nucleus, facial neuromas, parotid tumors involving the facial nerve, and other diseases were studied. MRI is a technique that allows unique evaluation of the entire course of the facial nerve. It produces superior images of the facial nerve with high-contrast resolution. Unlike computed tomography, there is no beam-hardening artifact from the temporal bone or exposure to ionizing radiation and contrast agents. MRI also allows visualization of the main trunks of the facial nerve in the parotid bed not possible with any other imaging technique.\r"

We present three such cases: cystic craniopharyngioma, Rathke's cleft cyst, and a persistent cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea caused by a patent craniopharyngeal canal.

Muscular contraction was induced on the intact side by stimulating different branches of the facial nerve, and corresponding information was channeled to the reinnervated side through an upgraded electronic stimulator via monopolar electrodes placed around the nerve pedicle in the neck. In addition to demonstrating perfect synchrony between intact and reinnervated sides, this facial stimulator allowed the reinnervated side of the face to follow the intact side in a graded and sustained fashion, thus demonstrating that fine tuning of reinnervated facial musculature was possible.\r"

Preimplant screening included audiometric testing, electronystagmogram (ENG), promontory stimulation, computed tomography (CT) scanning, and psychological evaluation. Based on postimplant audio-only CID sentence discrimination scores, these patients were divided into three groups: good (CID greater than 79%), intermediate (CID, 21% to 79%), and poor (CID less than 21%). Preimplant factors that correlated with CID scores were hearing loss duration, previous use of hearing aids, lip-reading ability, tinnitus, positive ENG calorics, preimplant pure-tone average, promontory stimulation threshold, and understanding of the project. Only previous hearing aid usage approached statistical significance (p = 0.05). A larger patient sample is needed to verify these results.\r"

Two mechanisms for blindness are apparent: (1) direct injury to the optic nerve and (2) retrobulbar (orbital) hematoma, which increases orbital pressure and compromises vascular supply and drainage to and from the eye. While several publications have discussed the management of blindness from a delayed operative vantage point, no publication has discussed the immediate management of blindness from intraoperative or immediate postoperative occurrence, stressing specific medical and surgical treatment. A review of the literature and the author's personal experience will be used as a basis to discuss the prevention and management of blindness during endoscopic intranasal ethmoidectomy. Case studies will be used to illustrate methods for prevention and management of blindness. If treated aggressively, blindness associated with retrobulbar hematoma can be reversed medically.\r"

Survival in intermediate lesions with bony erosion or middle ear involvement was related to the status of surgical margins after partial or subtotal temporal bone resections. Extensive lesions that involved the surrounding soft tissue or dura had poor prognoses. The survival value of total temporal bone resection remains unproved.\r"

The lesion is highly cellular and locally infiltrative and has a propensity to invade and erode bone, compromising vital structures within the head and neck. However, it is not a true malignancy because it does not have malignant cytologic characteristics nor does it metastasize. We present two cases of aggressive fibromatosis occurring in young adult men. The first case involved a rapidly enlarging mass of the anterior maxilla that involved the upper lip, nasal alae, nasal septum, inferior turbinates, and hard palate. The patient underwent incisional biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Because of difficulty in determining the actual margins of this extensive lesion and the significant morbidity that would have resulted from surgical resection, we elected to treat this patient with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The second case was an extensive lesion involving the right temporal bone, pterygomaxillary space, and infratemporal, temporal, and middle cranial fossae. Incisional biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Because of the lack of functional and cosmetic deficits and the unavoidable morbidity of a surgical resection, this patient was treated with radiation therapy. Although wide field resection is the most satisfactory form of treatment, in situations in which this modality would result in unacceptable morbidity or if surgical margins are positive, then radiation therapy and chemotherapy should be considered. Support for these therapeutic modalities is found in larger series of cases outside the head and neck.\r"

Tolerance and histologic reaction to 20 hours of periodic electrical stimulation of the cochlear nucleus were analyzed. Intraoperative and postoperative electrically evoked middle latency responses were monitored during stimulus trials. The threshold necessary to generate the middle latency responses was frequently below 50 microA. In the animals that received 50 and 100 microA of biphasic charge-balanced stimulation (corresponding to approximately 200 and 400 microC/cm2 phase), adverse tissue reaction was minimal, and glial proliferation along the electrode tract never exceeded 25 microns in width. Stimulation intensities of 150 and 200 microA (approximately 600 and 800 microC/cm2 phase) produced significant tissue response at the site of the electrode terminus, with necrosis, cell loss, and reactive cells present. Therefore neuronal damage was observed to occur at an intensity far greater than that required for eliciting an electrophysiologic response.\r"

  ".U": "90016308\r", 
  ".W": "In a companion paper, we reported that electrical stimulation increased cochlear blood flow (CBF). This response was found to be an increasing function of current intensity and was frequency-selective, with the best response at approximately 500 Hz continuous sinusoidal current. The present investigation seeks to discover the mechanism of this effect. Direct measurement of cochlear temperature during electrical stimulation revealed no evidence of local heating. Autonomic neuronal activation is not likely, as neither atropine, hexamethonium, nor propranolol abolished the evoked CBF response. Strial activity could be suppressed by the use of furosemide, but the evoked CBF response persisted. Inactivation of auditory afferent neurons with kainic acid also did not change the evoked CBF response. Dimethyl sulfoxide, a potent oxygen-free radical scavenger, did suppress the evoked CBF response to a small but significant degree. This suggests that oxygen-free radicals may be produced within the cochlea during electrical stimulation. Finally, the evoked CBF response was completely suppressed by procaine and tetrodotoxin, with recovery of evoked CBF response accompanying recovery of cochlear action potentials. These data indicate that stimulation of neural fibers, distinct from autonomic and auditory afferent neurons, may modulate CBF.\r"

  ".W": "Many inner ear disorders may be caused by alterations in cochlear blood flow (CBF). However, each measurement technique used to monitor CBF has limitations in examining the relationship between otopathologic states and blood flow. This study investigates laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and its fundamental drawback: the unknown relationship of LDF output to actual CBF. LDF readings are directly compared with concurrent intravital microscopy (IVM) measures of erythrocyte velocity in the lateral wall of the guinea pig cochlea. Positive end expiratory pressure, spontaneous respiration of 5% and 10% carbon dioxide, phenylephrine, and direct electrical stimulation of the cochlea were used to manipulate CBF. High, positive correlations were found between simultaneous LDF and IVM measurements of CBF. In addition, the study demonstrated that current microdissection techniques used to perform IVM do not cause changes in CBF. IVM measurements of CBF are a more sensitive indicator of CBF changes than are LDF measures. Despite the high correlation between measurement techniques within a single manipulation, simultaneous LDF and IVM measurements differed between manipulations. This may reflect regional changes in CBF affected by these manipulations and differences in the sampled vascular beds contributing to these two measures. It is unlikely that a single calibration factor can be defined that would allow the conversion of LDF output to actual units of blood flow across different manipulations used to alter CBF.\r"

Until other criteria for the selection of a subset of patients with a high incidence of synchronous tumours are found, the indication for panendoscopy as part of a routine diagnostic procedure has to be constantly questioned, and panendoscopy should therefore be performed only when this procedure is part of a prospective study.\r"

These findings were assessed in conjunction with the patients' subjective complaints. Results demonstrated that anterior rhinomanometric assessment of the nasal airway during inhalant therapy correlated well with the patients' own subjective impressions of nasal air flow.

Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a variant of RFP that is associated with recurrent facial edema. In the past, decompression of the mastoid segment of the facial nerve has not been successful in preventing recurrences. In 1981 we began performing total facial nerve decompression for RFP and in 1986 reported its efficacy in one patient with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome and in another in whom both nerves were decompressed for alternating bilateral paralysis. An additional four cases with 3 to 8 years of followup demonstrate no recurrences in any patient. Total facial nerve decompression for RFP in selected patients appears efficacious in preventing recurrences. Decompression will remain investigational until further followup is obtained. Furthermore, its salutary effect should not be extrapolated to Bell's palsy without further study.\r"

Postoperative aseptic leptomeningitis occurs more frequently than purulent bacterial meningitis. Differentiation between these two conditions early in the postoperative period is important to avoid delay in or unnecessary treatment. The definitive diagnosis is made with cerebral spinal fluid culture. Early differentiation between postoperative aseptic leptomeningitis and purulent bacterial meningitis on the basis of results of cerebral spinal fluid profile before cerebral spinal fluid culture would result in earlier appropriate therapy.\r"

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been the radiologic test of choice to evaluate the facial nerve. The necessary HRCT projections, slices, and enhancement techniques to visualize each segment have been outlined. We have developed a radiologic protocol that uses MRI in conjunction with HRCT, applying the strengths of each to evaluate the facial nerve. We have evaluated 15 patients and have found that MRI is the better study to evaluate the brain stem/cerebellopontine angle segment of the facial nerve and better evaluates bone-soft tissue interfaces. HRCT is better in the evaluation of the intratemporal segment of the facial nerve and the assessment of the anatomic perspectives of a lesion within the temporal bone. The results are discussed and case reports illustrate the efficacy of this approach.\r"

  ".W": "Temporal bone studies in cat, monkey, and man demonstrate that the cell bodies of the primary vestibular neurons located in Scarpa's ganglion persist after labyrinthectomy. However, it is not known whether the centrally directed axon process of deafferented vestibular neurons survive or degenerate after labyrinthectomy. If the central axon were to persist, then the primary vestibular neuron could influence vestibular compensation or produce symptoms of vestibular dysfunction. In the present study the temporal bones and brain stem of four cats were prepared for light microscopic examination with hematoxylin-eosin, silver, and trichrome connective tissue stains. Cell counts within Scarpa's ganglion were performed. After labyrinthectomy, many intact axons were demonstrated in the brain stem, a finding that correlated with survival of neurons in Scarpa's ganglion. This study provides anatomic evidence that primary vestibular neurons that survive labyrinthectomy may retain their central axon processes. The persistence of this neural pathway and data from behavioral studies in the cat suggest that vestibular neurons may affect vestibular compensation after labyrinthectomy. Deafferented vestibular neurons may play a role in human vestibular compensation and dysfunction.\r"

However, the audiometric characteristics of the test ear may obscure the interpretation of the click-evoked ABR, particularly in the face of high-frequency hearing loss. It is often unclear whether latency delays or absent responses are attributable to retrocochlear disease or simply to the magnitude of the patient's hearing loss. The acoustic click stimulus commonly used in ABR testing activates predominantly the basilar membrane in the 2000 to 4000 Hz range. Because many cochlear and retrocochlear processes are associated mainly with hearing loss in this range, we have found it helpful in selected cases to use 1000 Hz tone-burst stimuli to circumvent the effects of elevated hearing thresholds on the ABR. In this article, our experience with the use of 1000 Hz nonlinearly gated tonebursts in 17 patients with acoustic neuroma is presented.\r"

Because parenteral nutrition solutions contain the oxalate precursors ascorbate and glycine, the relationship between total parenteral nutrition administration and oxalate excretion in VLBW infants was examined. Administration of approximately 0.5 g of total parenteral nutrition protein per kilogram per day to VLBW infants was associated with an increased urinary oxalate concentration and an increased urinary oxalate to creatinine ratio, when compared with VLBW infants receiving a glucose and electrolyte solution. A further increase in urinary oxalate concentration and oxalate to creatinine ratio was noted when total parenteral nutrition protein was increased to approximately 1.5 g of protein per kilogram per day. In VLBW infants who receive total parenteral nutrition, elevated urinary oxalate concentrations may develop and may be a factor in the pathogenesis of nephrocalcinosis in these infants.\r"

Using color coded pH-paper, a total of 247 readings were made concurrently with x-rays to determine feeding tube position. Findings indicated that pH readings were often effective in differentiating between gastric and intestinal placement (p less than .0001). For example, approximately 81% of the aspirates from nasogastric tubes had pH values ranging from 1 through 4, while almost 88% of the aspirates from nasointestinal tubes had pH values of 6 or greater. Only one aspirate from a tube inadvertently placed in the lung was tested; as expected it had an alkaline pH.\r"

However, they are different from agonists, as they cannot trigger the \"stimulus\" that leads to biological responses--i.e., they lack intrinsic activity. For those receptors whose signals are transduced to effector systems by GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins), a mechanistic equivalent of such a stimulus is an increased ability of agonist-bound receptor to accelerate nucleotide exchange and thus GTPase activity on the G-protein molecule. Here we show that for a member of this family of receptors (delta opioid receptors in membranes of NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma cells), two types of competitive antagonists can be distinguished. One type has no intrinsic activity, since it neither stimulates nor inhibits the GTPase activity of G proteins and its apparent affinity for the receptor is not altered by pertussis toxin-mediated uncoupling of receptor and G protein. The second type, however, can inhibit GTPase and thus exhibits negative intrinsic activity; its affinity for receptors is increased following uncoupling from G proteins. The existence of antagonists with negative intrinsic activity may be a general feature of several classes of neurotransmitters or hormone receptors and calls for a reevaluation of biological effects produced by competitive antagonists.\r"

  ".U": "90017473\r", 
  ".W": "The Paramecium tetraurelia mutants termed pantophobiacs have altered behavior due to perturbed calcium activation of ion channel activity. The calmodulin from pantophobiac A1 (pntA1) was shown in previous studies to have a single amino acid change at residue 101 that is selective in its effects on activity. This change has no effect on posttranslational modifications. However, the calmodulin from the phenotypically related mutant pantophobiac A2 (pntA2) has a threonine residue at position 136, in the fourth calcium-binding domain, instead of an isoleucine or valine like all other calmodulins. This region of the calmodulin structure is within 4 A of a complementary hydrophobic structure in the third calcium-binding domain, raising the possibility of a perturbation of interdomain interactions in the pntA2 mutant. This possibility is supported by the heterogenous methylation state of lysine-115 in the pntA2 calmodulin. This lysine residue, located in the peptide connecting calcium-binding domains three and four, is fully trimethylated in the wild-type and pntA1 calmodulins. The functional selectivity of these structural changes is demonstrated by the conservation of calmodulin activator activity with a calmodulin-regulated protein kinase that has been used as a standard of comparison. Overall, these results indicate the degree to which the calmodulin can be mutated in vivo without being lethal to the organism, and they provide genetic evidence suggesting that the post-translational methylation state of residue 115 requires the appropriate conformation in addition to the local amino acid sequence.\r"

We have analyzed the region upstream of the B29 gene to identify DNA sequences involved in transcriptional regulation of this gene. The B29 gene lacks a TATA box and transcription is initiated at multiple sites. The B29 gene sequence 5' of these transcription start sites contains six promoter and enhancer motifs known to control immunoglobulin gene transcription. The most notable is a perfect octamer (5'-ATTTGCAT-3'), which binds the Oct-2 B-cell-specific transcription factor and thereby can account for the tissue-specific expression of this gene.\r"

The bacterial GABA system included a homogeneous binding site, and no cooperative interaction was found between sites.

On differentiation of the HL-60 cells into granulocytes induced by several inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase [NAD+ poly(adenosine diphosphate D-ribose)ADP-D-ribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.30] including benzamide, nicotinamide, coumarin, and 4-hydroxyquinazoline or dimethyl sulfoxide, some MYC loss was observed. In contrast, benzoic acid, a noninhibitory analogue of benzamide, did not induce either granulocytic differentiation or loss of MYC. Loss of MYC seems to be associated with granulocytic differentiation because the time course of its loss was similar to that of appearance of nitroblue tetrazolium-positive cells, mature granulocytes, and its loss was not observed on differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophages induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or teleocidin. The loss of MYC is not the reason for the down regulation of MYC expression observed within 1 hr after addition of inducers, since the loss of MYC was not detected by 1-day treatment with inducers.\r"

The intrathymic death of most thymocytes is probably related to selective influences that ensure that only those precursors bearing self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted and self-tolerant T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) survive to complete the maturation process. Interactions between surface molecules on thymocytes (TCR, CD4, and CD8) and thymic stromal cells (MHC proteins) are critical to repertoire selection. To understand this process, the lineage relationships among immature, nonmature, and mature thymocytes must be defined. We have examined directly the precursor-progeny relationships among CD4+8-, CD4-8+, and CD4+8+ murine thymocyte subsets by assessing their short-term (less than 5 days) developmental potentials following intrathymic injection into Thy-1 congenic, unirradiated host mice. Our results identify TCR-/lo CD4-8+ and TCRlo CD4+8+ blast cells as sequential intermediates in the development of mature TCRhi CD4+8- and TCRhi CD4-8+ thymocytes from CD4-8- precursors, thus defining at least one intrathymic maturation pathway for T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".U": "90017518\r", 
  ".W": "Serologic analysis of rabbit secretory IgA initially identified two subclasses of IgA, IgA-f and IgA-g. Recent molecular genetic studies have resulted in the identification and cloning of 13 genes encoding the constant region (C) of rabbit IgA heavy chains. Each of these 13 C alpha genes, C alpha 1-C alpha 13, was subcloned into an expression vector containing the VDJ (V, variable; D, diversity; J, joining) gene of a dansyl (DNS)-binding hybridoma antibody. The alpha heavy-chain constructs were transfected into SP2/0 cells producing murine light chains with specificity for DNS. Of the 13 resulting transfectomas, 12 were shown by ELISA to secrete DNS-binding chimeric rabbit-mouse IgA molecules. By immunoblot analysis, the 12 IgA-producing transfectomas were shown to secrete alpha chains ranging in size from 60 to 72 kDa. These data suggest that rabbit IgA may be composed of as many as 12 IgA isotypes. This is in marked contrast to mouse and human, in which only 1 and 2 IgA isotypes, respectively, are found. Serologic analyses, using anti-IgA-f and anti-IgA-g alloantisera, revealed that 11 of the 12 transfectoma IgAs reacted with anti-IgA-f and not with anti-IgA-g antibodies and that one reacted with anti-IgA-g and not with anti-IgA-f antibodies. Each of the IgA-producing transfectomas was cocultured with a Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line expressing the rabbit polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, and the transcytosed IgA antibodies were analyzed by immunoblots to determine whether they associated with secretory component (SC) through covalent or noncovalent interactions. Each of the 11 IgA-f isotypes was shown to bind SC by a disulfide linkage, whereas the single IgA-g isotype appeared to bind SC through noncovalent interactions only.\r"

  ".U": "90017522\r", 
  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) might be beneficial in several cardiovascular disorders, but its poor oral absorption and rapid inactivation in vivo have so far prevented its use in therapeutics. We have assessed the role of enkephalinase (membrane metallo-endopeptidase, EC 3.4.24.11) in the in vivo inactivation of ANF in mice and healthy human volunteers by evaluating the effects of acetorphan, a potent inhibitor. In mice, the degradation of 125I-labeled ANF was markedly delayed, as shown by the levels of the intact peptide in the plasma and the kidney, a major target organ. The effect of acetorphan was due to the inhibition of enkephalinase activity, since it occurred at an ED50 very close to this drug's ID50 for the inhibition of the specific binding of radioactive material to the kidney or lung peptidase that was measured after administration of [3H]acetorphan. The effects of acetorphan were also studied in eight healthy human volunteers by using a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Oral administration of acetorphan elicited a lasting elevation of plasma ANF-like immunoreactivity, with a time course parallel to that of the inhibition of plasma enkephalinase activity. These effects were accompanied by significant increases in urinary volume and sodium excretion, two well-established renal responses to ANF peptides. These results indicate that enkephalinase plays a critical role in ANF degradation in vivo and that its inhibition enhances the levels of circulating endogenous ANF, which, in turn, results in diuresis and natriuresis. Enkephalinase inhibition may constitute another therapeutic approach to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, such as congestive heart failure or essential hypertension, on which ANF is postulated to have a beneficial effect.\r"

  ".U": "90017523\r", 
  ".W": "Reocclusion of the coronary artery occurs after thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction despite routine use of the anticoagulant heparin. However, heparin is inhibited by platelet activation, which is greatly enhanced in this setting. Consequently, it is unclear whether thrombin induces acute reocclusion. To address this possibility, we examined the effect of argatroban [MCI9038, (2R,4R)-4-methyl-1-[N alpha-(3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8- quinolinesulfonyl)-L-arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid], a specific thrombin inhibitor, on the response to tissue-type plasminogen activator in a closed-chest canine model of coronary thrombosis. MCI9038 prolonged the thrombin time and shortened the time to reperfusion (28 +/- 2 min vs. 59 +/- 7 min in controls; mean +/- SEM, n = 5, P less than 0.01). At the highest dose, 2.5 mg/kg per hr, complete reocclusion was prevented in four of the five experimental animals, whereas reocclusion occurred in all five controls. However, reperfusion was complicated by cycles of decrease flow, which were abolished by the thromboxane A2 antagonist, GR32191. GR32191 at 1 mg/kg combined with MCI9038 at 0.5 mg/kg per hr prevented reocclusion, whereas, at these doses, either drug alone was without effect. In addition, thromboxane A2 biosynthesis, determined as excretion of its metabolite 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2, was increased after reperfusion at all doses of MCI9038. These data demonstrate that thrombin impairs thrombolysis induced by tissue-type plasminogen activator in vivo and induces acute reocclusion. Furthermore, the response to thrombin inhibition may be impaired by continued formation of thromboxane A2.\r"

The level of the APP mRNA transcripts increased as HUVEC reached confluency. In confluent culture the half-life of the APP mRNA was 4 hr. Treatment of the cells with human-recombinant interleukin 1 (IL-1), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or heparin-binding growth factor 1 enhanced the expression of APP gene in these cells, but calcium ionophore A23187 and dexamethasone did not. The protein kinase C inhibitor 1-(isoquinolinsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7) inhibited IL-1-mediated increase of the level of APP transcripts. To map IL-1-responsive elements of the APP promoter, truncated portions of the APP promoter were fused to the human growth hormone reporter gene. The recombinant plasmids were transfected into mouse neuroblastoma cells, and the cell medium was assayed for the human growth hormone. A 180-base-pair region of the APP promoter located between position -485 and -305 upstream from the transcription start site was necessary for IL-1-mediated induction of the reporter gene. This region contains the upstream transcription factor AP-1 binding site. These results suggest that IL-1 upregulates APP gene expression in HUVEC through a pathway mediated by protein kinase C, utilizing the upstream AP-1 binding site of the APP promoter.\r"

Strategies need to address as well conditions such as racism and ethnic prejudices that keep many Hispanic homosexuals and bisexuals away from white or non-Hispanic gay organizations and publications, the lack of culturally appropriate drug treatment centers, the level of mis-information among Hispanics, and the possible high incidence among men of sexual intercourse with prostitutes. Prevention campaigns need to include such Hispanic cultural values as simpatia, familialism, personalismo, and power distance, if prevention campaigns are going to be perceived as relevant by Hispanics. Appropriate wording and communication channels need to be identified in order to transmit messages that will be perceived as credible and that will reach the largest possible audience.\r"

The records were those of Michigan Medicaid, the General Assistance Medical Program, and the Resident County Hospitalization Program, with service dates on or after January 1, 1984, and which were processed by November 30, 1987. Patient payment records were coded according to whether the patient's condition was considered to be pre-HIV, HIV unrelated, possibly HIV related, or HIV related. Average monthly payments were found to be $150 for pre-HIV patient payment records, $114 for those HIV unrelated, $57 for those possibly related, and $1,213 for those related to HIV infection. HIV-related monthly payments rose from about $1,500 per month in the period 3 months prior to the patient's death to more than $8,000 in the last month of life. Men were found to have twice as many claims as women, and men's claims cost about three times as much. A higher percentage of women than men (91 percent versus 37 percent) received pre-HIV paid services, indicating a higher percentage of women were at least initially receiving Medicaid for reasons other than an HIV-related disability. Diagnostic categories that accounted for the bulk of the HIV-related health care utilization included infectious and parasitic diseases, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, diseases of the respiratory system, and non-HIV-specific immunity disorders. Inpatient hospitalization accounted for more than 75 percent of the payments, followed by physician costs (11 percent), pharmacy costs (5 percent), and outpatient costs (3 percent). A total of 45, or about 22 percent of the recipients, received zidovudine (AZT) prescriptions at an average monthly cost of $404.\r"

Under the NIHCC guidelines, 31 percent of the participants would have been referred to their physicians, 32 percent under the NCEP guidelines, and 56 percent would have been referred had the 5.2 mmol per L cutpoint been used. Twenty-four percent of the participants would have been referred under both the NIHCC and NCEP guidelines; 7 percent would have been referred under the NIHCC guidelines, but not the NCEP's. Eight percent would have been referred under the NCEP guidelines, but not the NIHCC's. Those who would have been referred were older, and more likely to be male and to have low levels of HDL cholesterol than the 7 percent who would have been referred under NIHCC guidelines only. All of the 8 percent had coronary heart disease, or two or more other coronary risk factors, whereas none of the 7 percent did. If low HDL had been used as a risk factor under NCEP guidelines, the number of persons referred would have increased slightly (to 34 percent) and low HDL levels would have become one of the most prevalent risk factors. The researchers concluded that public cholesterol screening programs should use the NCEP guidelines (with or without HDL), rather than the NIHCC guidelines, or a single 5.2 mmol per L cutpoint.\r"

  ".W": "The effects during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood of having a parent with a drinking problem has interested researchers in several countries. The greatest number of reports related to this subject have appeared in the U.S. literature and in the literature from countries of Eastern Europe. This review encompasses the findings of researchers in these countries as well as workers in Western Europe, Latin America, and Japan. This review does not include biological, physiological, or neurological data. The epidemiologic evidence from several countries shows significant points of agreement. Problem drinking by a parent markedly increases health risks to children and adolescents. Such risks include diminished intellectual capacity and development, increased neuroticism, and a wide range of psychological and behavioral disorders. Parents who drink excessively are also likely to have children who experience long-term adverse consequences. These include heavy and problem-causing psychoactive substance use, criminality, suicide, depression, personality disorders, and psychological and behavioral disturbances. Parents who drink heavily are also especially likely to produce children who subsequently abstain from alcohol or drink only lightly.\r"

  ".W": "The growing evidence linking dietary patterns to the incidence and prevention of chronic disease has prompted a number of prominent health and scientific agencies to publish dietary guidelines for the public. Some dietary guidelines address specific diseases, such as cancer or heart disease; others focus on overall health promotion. This situation has created a demand for nutrition education and information programs for the public. Increasingly, supermarkets are seen as potential sites for effective consumer education. Eat for Health is a joint research study by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Giant Food Inc., a regional supermarket chain in the Washington-Baltimore area. The study's goal was to test the feasibility of supermarkets as a site for consumer nutrition education. Eat for Health's educational focus was diet and cancer control issues in the context of dietary patterns that promote health. Particular attention was paid to reduction of fat intake and increases in consumption of dietary fiber from grains, vegetables, and fruits. Analysis of program results is currently underway; data should be available in early 1990.\r"

  ".W": "Homeless people eat foods at municipal and charity run shelters, fast-food restaurants, delicatessens, and from garbage bins. Data on the adequacy of the diets and the nutritional status of homeless persons are sparse. Therefore, nutritional indicators of 55 urban homeless subjects were assessed, and a high prevalence of risk factors was identified. Although 93 percent of subjects reported that they obtained enough to eat, a low dietary adequacy score of 10.1 (norm = 16) indicated that the quality of the diet was inadequate. Diet records showed a high intake of sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Serum cholesterol levels above the desirable limit of 200 mg per dl were prevalent. Anthropometric measurements were significantly different from percentile distributions of the U.S. population (P less than .001). Triceps skinfold measurement was above the 95th percentile in 25 percent of subjects. Upper arm muscle area, which reflects lean body mass, was below the 5th percentile in 23.3 percent of women and 44 percent of the men. These decreased levels of lean body mass and increased levels of body fat, together with the elevated serum cholesterol levels and the shortages of essential nutrients in the diet, may place the homeless at risk of developing nutrition-related disorders.\r"

  ".W": "The authors used 1987 data from the Epidemiologic Surveillance Project (ESP) of the Centers for Disease Control to examine the completeness of race-ethnicity reporting in the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. And, to the extent possible, they used ESP to assess racial and ethnic disparities in the occurrence of selected notifiable infectious diseases. For the 30 reporting areas (29 States and the District of Columbia) that provided data to ESP for all of calendar year 1987, approximately 60 percent of case reports were accompanied by specified race-ethnicity for affected persons. This percentage varied widely by disease and State. In general, non-Hispanic whites had morbidity rates (cases per 100,000 population per year) that were among the lowest compared with rates for other groups, and Native Americans commonly had rates that were among the highest. The ranking of morbidity rates among blacks, Hispanics, and Asians and Pacific Islanders varied by disease, although the last group had strikingly higher rates for malaria and tuberculosis. The age distribution of persons with cases was often lower among minority groups than among non-Hispanic whites, but the authors were unable to calculate age-specific or age-adjusted rates. Potential biases that limit interpretation of the findings are reviewed. Efforts to eliminate racial-ethnic disparities in the occurrence of infectious diseases would be aided by effective surveillance data. For the ESP to meet its potential in this regard, however, substantial improvements in the reporting of race-ethnicity for notifiable diseases are needed.\r"

  ".U": "90018190\r", 
  ".W": "Home care programs for severely disabled, usually technology-dependent, children got a boost in 1981 when the Federal Government gave States permission to use Medicaid to fund home care under the Medicaid model home- and community-based waiver (2176). The model waiver program was unique because it eliminated the bias toward hospitalization by waiving parental income and assets when determining eligibility for children cared for at home and by allowing Medicaid to cover needed home care services. In 1985 Minnesota received Federal approval for the model waiver, and the results are detailed in this report. Although the waiver could provide funding for up to 50 children, after 2 years only 24 children had received approval. Stringent and complex eligibility criteria acted as barriers to accessing the model waiver. In addition, the interaction between the waiver and the State's health care system contributed to inconsistencies in eligibility. This interaction demonstrates the difficulty of administering publicly funded programs in the current health care environment. Recommendations are made for adjusting criteria for eligibility in the waiver program. Unresolved problems facing technology-dependent children on home care programs are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90018191\r", 
  ".W": "Although fetal development is known to be sensitive to environmental agents, relatively little epidemiologic research has addressed this concern. Effects on pregnancy outcome of self-reported parental exposure to pesticides and to radiation were examined using data from the National Natality and Fetal Mortality Surveys, large national probability samples of live births and stillbirths occurring in 1980. In case-control analyses, maternal exposure to pesticides at home or work was associated with increased risk of stillbirth (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.5-1.6). Paternal pesticide exposure was associated with stillbirth (ORs = 1.2-1.4) and delivery of small-for-gestational-age infants (ORs = 1.4-2.0). A small increased risk of stillbirth (OR = 1.3) was found in relation to either parent's reported exposure to radiation. In spite of limitations in the quality of exposure data and the possibility of biased recall related to pregnancy outcome, associations of reported pesticide exposure to either parent with risk of stillbirth and small-for-gestational-age infants warrant further evaluation.\r"

Sampling was done to assure that study subjects were representative of all care-seeking, diagnosed diabetics in a well-defined Navajo community. The two groups of patients were comparable in terms of age, sex, and duration of diabetes from time of diagnosis. Compliance with care, hospitalization rates, and complication rates were similar in each group. Results showed no significant differences in glycemic control between the rural clinic (mean fasting plasma glucose = 177, mean random plasma glucose = 227) and the regional hospital clinic (mean fasting plasma glucose = 187, mean random plasma glucose = 249). The percentages of diabetics under \"acceptable\" control by American Diabetes Association guidelines was 40 percent at the rural clinic and 29 percent at the hospital clinic (P greater than .05). The authors conclude that adequacy of glycemic control in diabetics is not compromised by providing care at a remote rural clinic.\r"

Record incompleteness varied between 92.8 percent and 14.0 percent for the various study variables. No gender differences were detected among the groups; more than 70.0 percent of the patients were ages 15 to 64 years. Multiple traumatic injuries were frequent for inpatients across age groups, while simple contusions were more frequent among outpatients. Multiple head traumas, thorax-abdomen multiple traumas, and simple fractures of an arm or leg were more frequently recorded for inpatients than for outpatients. Head wounds with contusions; simple contusion of the thorax-abdomen, arms, and legs; and psychological trauma were more frequently recorded for outpatients. Although a great many records were incomplete, the data may reflect what actually happened to these patients, given the similarity of the findings with other reports of disasters. Improved record keeping during emergencies is needed to standardize the quantity and the reliability of the data so that statistical and medical care requirements are soundly based. The use of standard questionnaires for data collection is stressed to facilitate the management of clinical and epidemiologic activities. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine patterns of physical injuries, psychological trauma, and survival.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship of births weighing less than 1,000 grams (g) to fetal and neonatal mortality rates, including changes over time, was studied. In Alabama during the period 1974-84, the percentage of reported births that weighed less than 500 g doubled, and the percentage of reported births weighing 500 to 999 g increased by about 10 percent. By the end of the study, while only 0.13 percent of reported births weighed less than 500 g, 24 percent of all stillbirths and 14 percent of all neonatal deaths were in this birth weight group. Similarly, in 1984, while only 0.62 percent of all births weighed 500 to 999 g, 23 percent of stillbirths and 42 percent of neonatal deaths were in this birth weight group. The data suggest that Alabama neonatal and fetal mortality rates declined more than was apparent in vital statistics data because of changes in reporting practices for very low birth weight newborns during the study period. Changes in vital statistics reporting are suggested to improve data reliability.\r"

In this study strengths and weaknesses of existing data for all-terrain vehicles were identified and ways to improve data collection and linkages across data systems are suggested. Based on this evaluation, linked death certificates and medical examiner data provide an excellent mechanism for monitoring vehicle-related fatalities. Information sources for nonfatal and nonvehicle-related injuries require further development. Police records provide supplemental information, but they are limited to the events reported to police. Although other sources were explored, they added no advantage to the primary sources. Data processing, analysis, and dissemination--traditional responsibilities for public health and other governmental agencies--can transform these data sources into meaningful mechanisms to define injury trends and monitor injury-specific intervention strategies.\r"

In this report, the health habits of a particular occupational group--the military--are compared with those of the civilian population, and the extent to which the health habits of the military personnel are associated with their health status is examined. Responses to two surveys conducted in 1985 were analyzed by age group, sex, race, and educational level. The comparisons involved six of the seven health habits included in the Alameda study. Military personnel, because they are younger and their lives are more regimented, excel in meeting weight standards for the services and engaging in desirable levels of physical activity. Smoking habits of military personnel were less favorable than those of the civilians. An examination of the health status of the military for the year preceding the survey suggested that some health habits have immediate manifestations, but the impact of others may not be evident until later in life.\r"

  ".W": "Despite an increase in policies regulating smoking at the workplace, little research has been conducted on organizational factors that may be associated with the adoption of those policies. In November 1986, a survey assessing tobacco use habits was sent to 3,432 employees of 68 auto dealerships in western New York. Managers at the worksites were surveyed by telephone in 1986 and 1 year later to assess their attitudes about smoking by employees and changes in smoking policy implementation. At the time of the initial survey, 21 percent (N = 14) of businesses had smoking restrictions. Among the 54 worksites with no smoking restrictions, 14 (26 percent) adopted smoking policies within a year. The strongest predictor of policy adoption was an interaction between the presence of floating smoking restrictions (not tied to a specific area) and the manager's willingness to impose smoking restrictions on employees. Adoption of policies was also more likely to occur among worksites with younger employees. That adoption of smoking policies was more likely to occur among worksites with floating smoking policies underscores the idea that focusing efforts at the managerial level within an organization can accelerate the diffusion process. In addition, the presence of unions and employee concerns about smoking policies are likely to impact upon management's decisions regarding implementation of policies. Given the potential of smoking prohibitions to influence the smoking habits of employees, future studies should begin to focus on ways to facilitate the adoption of smoking policies in worksites.\r"

In order to test the hypothesis that calcium binding proteins protect against the effects of prolonged stimulation, intracellular recordings were made in hippocampal slices from cells that lack immunoreactivity for calcium binding proteins. Calcium binding protein-negative cells showed electrophysiological signs of deterioration during prolonged stimulation; cells containing calcium binding protein did not. When neurons without calcium binding proteins were impaled with microelectrodes containing the calcium chelator BAPTA, and BAPTA was allowed to diffuse into the cells, these cells showed no deterioration. These results indicate that, in a complex tissue of the central nervous system, an activity-induced increase in intracellular calcium can trigger processes leading to cell deterioration, and that increasing the calcium binding capacity of a cell decreases its vulnerability to damage.\r"

Eighteen external jugular veins were cryopreserved and implanted into the carotid arteries of mongrel dogs. All grafts were patent at the time of excision. Electron microscopy documented a disrupted endothelium in the homografts at 3 months that was intact at 9 months. The cellular infiltrate, suggestive of rejection, in the 3-month homografts resolved by 9 months. Prostacyclin production at 3 months was 8.7 +/- 3.2 pg/ml/cm2 compared with 24.1 +/- 9.6 pg/ml/cm2 (p less than 0.025) in the adjacent carotid artery. The prostacyclin production in the 6-month homografts was 21.7 +/- 12.4 pg/ml/cm2, not significantly different from the adjacent carotid artery. The return of prostacyclin paralleled the return of an intact endothelium. Compliance of fresh vein was diminished by cryopreservation, from 1.57 +/- 0.39% radial change/mm Hg (10(-2] to 0.79 +/- 0.21% radial change/mg Hg (10(-2] (p less than 0.02). The compliance of CVH at 3 months (1.7 +/- 1.0) and at 6 months (1.1 +/- 0.42) was not significantly different from cryopreserved veins. These data showed that CVH remained patent in dogs for 9 months, without loss of compliance for 6 months, and developed a morphologically intact and functional endothelium that paralleled the resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate.\r"

  ".W": "In a study designed to determine the protective effect of the specific histamine H1 antagonist terfenadine on hypertonic saline induced bronchoconstriction, 10 asthmatic subjects underwent hypertonic saline challenge (3.6%) after premedication with placebo or terfenadine (120 mg) 12 and two hours before the challenge. Hypertonic saline was administered in a dose dependent manner and the response determined as the dose of hypertonic saline that induced a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20 FEV1). FEV1 was on average 11% greater with terfenadine than with placebo given before the challenge with hypertonic saline. PD20 FEV1 was attenuated by a mean of 2.5 fold after terfenadine (geometric mean PD20 FEV1 was 22 litres after placebo and 56 l after terfenadine). There was substantial intersubject variation in the inhibitory effect of terfenadine on hypertonic saline induced bronchoconstriction: the ratio of the PD20 hypertonic saline after terfenadine to that after placebo ranged from 0.9 to 10.0. Terfenadine inhibited histamine induced bronchoconstriction in the eight subjects in whom it was tested, by 13 to 160 fold compared with placebo in four subjects and by greater than 2 to greater than 9 fold in the four who showed no response to the highest dose of histamine given (16 mg/ml). These results suggest that histamine release has a role in hypertonic saline induced bronchoconstriction in some individuals; other mediators or mechanisms may have a more prominent role in others.\r"

When placed under the window, calcium ionophore, acetylcholine, and previously acidified sodium nitrite each dilated the arterioles. If the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin or acetylsalicylic acid were first placed in the chamber, subsequent dilation of the arterioles by calcium ionophore was reduced to essentially zero. Similar blockade of cyclooxygenase failed to significantly reduce dilation by acetylcholine or sodium nitrite. We have previously shown that dilations by calcium ionophore and acetylcholine were endothelium dependent. Our present experiments show that the endothelium-dependent mechanism for dilation by calcium ionophore is cyclooxygenase dependent, while that for acetylcholine is not. This implies that, in pial arterioles, the endothelium-derived relaxing factor for acetylcholine differs from that for calcium ionophore. This agrees with data from other microvascular beds.\r"

Recently, the results of a randomized, controlled, multicenter intergroup study of combined therapy sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) became available. These results suggest that combined therapy offers some advantages over monotherapy in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. A variety of drugs are available to suppress adrenal androgens.

  ".W": "The presence of intravascular thrombus can make coronary angioplasty difficult or impossible to perform. To determine if thrombolytic agents could lyse large, nonacute thrombi, we retrospectively analyzed the angiograms of all 14 patients with unstable angina and large intravascular thrombi (greater than 2 cm in length) who were treated with thrombolytic agents at The Johns Hopkins Hospital between October 1987 and April 1989. Twelve patients were treated with intracoronary streptokinase, and two with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Coronary arteriography was repeated immediately after treatment and a mean of 1.6 +/- 0.3 days later. The degree of thrombolysis and change in distal vessel perfusion was evaluated. Thrombolysis was graded as considerable if there was greater than 75% resolution of apparent thrombus, and as complete if no stenosis or only a discrete residual stenosis was apparent. Fifty-seven percent of patients ultimately achieved considerable or complete thrombolysis and were able to undergo successful angioplasty. Patients achieving considerable or complete thrombolysis had a 28 +/- 7% increase in luminal diameter and demonstrated normalization of initially absent distal perfusion, except for the one patient who had normal distal flow prior to treatment. A maximal thrombolytic effect was evident only at the time of \"delayed\" angiography in all patients who responded to treatment and underwent both follow-up arteriograms. We conclude that thrombolytic agents can effectively lyse large, nonacute intravascular thrombi, thereby facilitating coronary angioplasty. A full thrombolytic effect does not occur for hours to days after drug administration, and may not become evident unless delayed angiography is performed.\r"

If blood pressure increased to more than 120 mm Hg, nitroprusside was administered. Intravenous nicardipine was superior to nitroglycerin in control of hypertension after coronary artery bypass grafting. In patients treated with nicardipine, blood pressure was decreased sooner (mean infusion time 7.7 hours vs 11.9 hours for nitroglycerin), mean systolic blood pressure was reduced (94 vs 108 mm Hg for the nitroglycerin group; p less than 0.05), and no patient required nitroprusside treatment (compared with 3 patients who required this treatment in the nitroglycerin group).

However, significant interactions existed between subjects with the ventilated tent and hood and calorimeter when measurements were taken in subjects who were unaccustomed to the apparatus.

After weight recovery, basal T4 and TSH levels were unchanged and significantly lower in AN patients than in control subjects. Basal T3 concentrations increased significantly after weight gain: however, concentrations remained lower than those in the control subjects. The maximum increase in T3 and T3 net secretory response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), obtained before and after weight recovery, appeared significantly lower than that in control subjects: however, the increases in TSH responses were not different from those of control subjects. Thus, low T3 concentrations in AN patients may be due not only to impaired peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 associated with the altered nutritional state, but also to decreased thyroidal T3 secretion in response to endogenous TSH, which is indicative of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroidal dysfunction.\r"

Respiratory quotient increased 9% in the nonseptic (p less than 0.01) and 5% in the septic (p less than 0.05) patients during infusion. Plasma glucose and insulin increased identically in both groups. Cortisol was consistently higher in the septic patients whereas glucagon decreased similarly in both groups with feeding.

  ".W": "A 67-year-old male with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 43 seconds (normal, 25-40 seconds) was found to have laboratory features of von Willebrand's disease and IgA myeloma but had a normal bleeding time and no bleeding tendency. Plasma Factor VIII coagulant activity (F.VIII:C) was 80 U/L (0.08 U/mL), Factor VIII antigen (F.VIII:Ag) 70 U/L (0.07 U/mL), and von Willebrand's factor antigen (vWF:Ag) 50 U/L (0.05 U/mL) and ristocetin cofactor (vWF:RiCoF) 10 U/L (0.10 U/mL). The platelet vWF:Ag level was normal, whereas both platelet lysate and plasma vWF high molecular weight multimers were decreased. Patient plasma had no inhibitory effect on either F.VIII:C or vWF:RiCoF. However, when patient plasma was incubated with normal plasma, crossed immunoelectrophoresis for vWF:Ag demonstrated the presence of immune complexes. Infusion of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin led to a transient correction of the plasma vWF:Ag multimer pattern. The survival of all components of vWF/F.VIII was decreased, as also occurred after cryoprecipitate. The levels of plasma F.VIII/vWF increased as the IgA values decreased after chemotherapy, whereas the platelet high molecular weight multimers remained decreased. The data suggest that the plasma vWF/F.VIII deficiency results from complexing of the IgA myeloma protein with vWF, resulting in premature clearance of the vWF/F.VIII complex. The absence of clinical bleeding likely results from the combination of a normal platelet vWF:Ag level and persistence of intermediate molecular weight vWF multimers.\r"

In the present study, the authors examined the relationship between APO B-100 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in a hypercholesterolemic population that was treated with 16 weeks of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor therapy to lower plasma cholesterol levels. The average decrease in APO B-100 was -0.27 g/L (23% of baseline), which was similar to the decrease in LDL cholesterol, -1.6 mmol/L (-0.61 g/L) (30% of baseline). Correlation data (r = 0.902) indicated that the information provided by the two parameters corresponded in individual cases. Apolipoproteins assayed on automated equipment by kit methods are simpler, more straightforward, and provide more reproducible results than measurement of lipoprotein cholesterols. The authors conclude that, in addition to being more reliable for appraising risk of coronary artery disease, measurement of apolipoproteins may be equally useful for monitoring lipoprotein-lowering therapy.\r"

Continuous positive airway pressure was delivered at end-expiratory pressures of 4 cm H2O, while peak pressures of 20 cm H2O and end-expiratory pressures of 4 cm H2O were used during nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation at ventilatory rates of 20 breaths per minute. The frequency and extent of apnea and bradycardia during a 6-hour period in a patient receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure were compared with a similar crossover period of nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation. Although the infants had slightly less frequent episodes of apnea per hour (0.6 +/- 0.7 vs 0.5 +/- 0.7) and bradycardia per hour (1.2 +/- 1.3 vs 0.9 +/- 1.0) during nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation, these differences were not significant. There were no significant differences in the severity of these events as assessed by the duration and fall in transcutaneous oxygen pressure during apnea and heart rate during bradycardia. There were no significant changes in blood gases throughout the study. Nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation appears to have no advantages over nasal continuous positive airway pressure in preventing apnea and does not alter gas exchange in infants of less than 32 weeks of gestation.\r"

Most affected males showing IgG subclass immune deficiency could not produce antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen and had deficient responses to challenge with bacteriophage phi X174. CONCLUSION: Use of only one of the techniques described can fail to lead to the diagnosis of XLP, because problems can prevail with each individual determination.\r"

For men with initial cholesterol levels of 310 mg/dl, the cost effectiveness of cholestyramine, expressed in Dutch guilders, ranges from approximately 220,000 to 510,000 guilders per year of life saved, depending on age at initiation of therapy. For simvastatin, cost-effectiveness ratios range from 50,000 to 110,000 guilders per year of life saved among this group of men. Results are similar for women, although the cost effectiveness of both agents is considerably less. These results suggest that simvastatin is substantially more cost effective than cholestyramine; that it compares well with other generally accepted medical practices, especially if therapy is initiated at an early age; and that simvastatin should become accepted as a drug of first choice in the treatment of persons with elevated serum cholesterol levels as its long-term safety record becomes more established.\r"

  ".W": "Remodeling of the extracellular matrix is an important function of interstitial collagenase. The activity of this enzyme forms the initial and rate limiting step in collagen degradation; moreover, this enzyme appears representative of a family of connective tissue metalloproteinases. Conversely, a widely distributed glycoprotein, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP), may be an important regulator of matrix degradation. To study the roles of collagenase and TIMP in pathologically altered dermal connective tissue, immunohistochemistry was used to localize collagenase and TIMP in an eruptive xanthoma, a chronic tuberous xanthoma, and normal skin. Normal skin and the chronic tuberous xanthoma showed mild diffuse staining of both proteins throughout the dermis. In contrast, intense dermal staining of both collagenase and TIMP was present in the eruptive xanthoma. Thus, the marked accumulation of lipid in dermal macrophages was associated with a significant increase in matrix collagenase and TIMP. This increase may reflect direct production of these two proteins by macrophages. Alternatively, it may be due to increased production by fibroblasts stimulated by macrophage-derived cytokines. The balance of degradative and inhibitory activities in the extracellular matrix may regulate the extent and nature of dermal remodeling.\r"

  ".W": "The authors previously demonstrated that arginine vasopressin (AVP) lowers pulmonary artery pressure in rats with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension by activation of the V1 receptor. The pulmonary depressor effect of AVP in hypoxia-adapted rats is not due to its effect on cardiac output. The current study tested two alternative hypotheses: that AVP lowers pulmonary artery pressure in the hypoxia-adapted lung by (1) dilating pulmonary vasculature directly, or (2) releasing atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) from the heart. The first hypothesis was tested by injecting AVP into the pulmonary arteries of isolated, buffer perfused lungs and monitoring pulmonary artery pressure, and by exposing preconstricted pulmonary artery rings to graded doses of AVP and monitoring the tension generated. AVP caused minimal vasodilation in perfused lungs and only a small vasodilator effect in pulmonary artery rings. The second hypothesis was tested by injecting AVP (160 ng/kg) or vehicle intravenously in conscious hypoxia-adapted (4 weeks) or air control rats and measuring ANP in arterial blood and atria, and by testing pretreatment with the V1 receptor antagonist d(CH2)5 Tyr(Me)AVP (130 micrograms/kg) on the AVP-induced increase in plasma ANP. AVP produced a 7-fold increase in plasma ANP (209 +/- 33 to 1346 +/- 233 pg/ml; p less than 0.05) in hypoxia-adapted rats and a 5-fold increase in ANP (122 +/- 22 to 573 +/- 174 pg/ml; p less than 0.05) in air controls. ANP release was abolished by pretreatment of both groups with d(CH2)5 Tyr(Me)AVP. The AVP-induced ANP release came mainly from left atrium. These data strongly suggest that the pulmonary depressor effects of AVP in hypoxia-adapted rats is due to augmented V1 receptor-induced release of ANP from left atrium.\r"

This report studied renal failure patients receiving dialysis and nondialyzed medical patients with respect to variations of the pK'1 of carbonic acid dissociation and discrepancies between measured and calculated bicarbonate. Among dialyzed patients, the mean pK'1 differed significantly from 6.10, and a significant difference was found between calculated and measured total CO2 even though all assays were performed on the same arterial blood. Significant correlations were observed between pK'1 and calculated-measured total CO2 as well as serum phosphate converted to mEq/l in the dialyzed group. These data suggest that there is a need to reevaluate current acid-base analysis, especially as it is applied to very seriously ill individuals.\r"

The responsiveness of the ANP and renin (PRA)-aldosterone (PA) systems to acute increases in right atrial pressure has not been studied in these patients, but in normals a reciprocal relationship between ANP with PRA and PA has been shown. The authors monitored venous pressure (VP, reflective of right atrial pressure), ANP, PRA and PA in 15 stable COLD patients, seven stable CHF patients and three normal controls at baseline and after elevation of VP by antishock trousers. Inflation of the trousers resulted in increased VP and ANP (p less than 0.05): control ANP, 84 +/- 17 to 108 +/- 23 pg/ml; COLD ANP, 176 +/- 5 to 200 +/- 7; and CHF ANP, 388 +/- 20 to 499 +/- 37. PRA and PA were not suppressed by increasing ANP levels and the delta ANP/delta VP ratio was similar among groups. No intergroup differences in resting PRA and PA were noted, but PRA was higher (p = 0.007) and PA tended to be higher (p = 0.08) in a sub-group of six edematous patients, as compared with non-edematous patients and controls. These findings: (1) confirm previously reported ANP differences between COLD and CHF; (2) indicate that the ANP system remains responsive to physiologic manipulations in COLD and CHF; and (3) demonstrate that ANP and the PRA-PA axis are not reciprocally related in either group.\r"

Since the secretion of atrial natriuretic factor by human atrial myocytes is stimulated by increased intraatrial pressure or atrial distention, we sought to determine whether circulating maternal plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentrations were lower in patients with preeclampsia compared to normal pregnant women. The level of alpha-human atrial natriuretic factor was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. Maternal venous concentrations of a alpha-human atrial natriuretic factor were higher in patients with severe preeclampsia (116.12 +/- 13.37 pg/ml) than in normal pregnant women (80.30 +/- 4.02 pg/ml). Umbilical artery alpha-human atrial natriuretic factor concentrations were higher in fetuses born to patients with severe preeclampsia (197.68 +/- 29.10 pg/ml) than normal control subjects (118.00 +/- 12.52 pg/ml). Umbilical artery alpha-human atrial natriuretic factor concentrations were higher than umbilical or maternal venous concentrations. In cases of severe preeclampsia, despite the presumed volume changes, maternal atrial natriuretic factor concentrations are higher than in normal pregnant women. The fetus appears to produce its own atrial natriuretic factor. Umbilical artery atrial natriuretic factor concentrations in fetuses born to preeclamptic mothers are higher than those seen in normal control subjects.\r"

In 10 chronically catheterized fetal sheep averaging 130 +/- 1 (SE) days' gestation, a balanced, isotonic electrolyte solution (Isolyte S) was infused continuously for 5 days into a fetal vein at a rate of 0, 1, 2, 4, and 0 L/day, respectively. During the infusion, fetal blood volume increased by a maximum of 6.4 +/- 2.0% (p less than 0.001), and the daily swallowing of amniotic fluid doubled (p less than 0.001). Fetal urine flow increased (p less than 0.0001) above preinfusion rates by a volume equal to the infusion rate plus the increase in swallowing, whereas renal excretion of sodium and chloride increased by the amount infused. The increase in the plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic factor (p less than 0.0001) and the decrease in arginine vasopressin (p less than 0.05) were not linearly related to urine flow changes. Amniotic fluid volume increased (p less than 0.0001) by 20% of the infused volume. All values returned to normal on day 5 except amniotic fluid volume, which remained elevated. Estimated allantoic fluid volume at the end of day 5 was 800 ml above normal. Thus it appears that on a long-term basis, the ovine fetus eliminates infused water and electrolytes through its kidneys rather than across the placenta. Although all of the infused volume left the fetus through its kidneys, only 30% of the infused volume remained in the amniotic and allantoic fluid compartments, suggesting transfer to the mother by unknown mechanisms.\r"

Suppression of serum levels of estradiol was greater with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment. Pain symptoms improved markedly during treatment in both groups. At the end of treatment a repeat laparoscopy was performed only in the patients who agreed to it (12 in the buserelin group and 13 in the danazol group), and it did not reveal significant differences in the effects of the two treatments on the endometriotic implants. All of the patients were followed up for at least 12 months, during which pregnancy was attempted. At 18 months the cumulative pregnancy rate was 48% in the patients treated with buserelin and 43% in those treated with danazol. Pain recurrence was observed in about half of the patients in each group 1 year after treatment suspension. The side effects were more frequent and more severe in the danazol-treated patients, whereas those given buserelin generally reported only symptoms of hypoestrogenism. The results of this study suggests that buserelin is at least as effective as danazol in the treatment of endometriosis when the outcome is considered in terms of restored fertility, and its side effects are less severe.\r"

Twenty-five pregnancies were normal (group 1), 13 were complicated by fetomaternal alloimmunization (group 2), and 16 by intrauterine growth retardation (group 3). The maternal glucose concentration was similar in the three groups. The fetal glucose level was significantly lower in growth-retarded (mean = 2.7 mmol/L) than in normal pregnancies (mean = 3.5 mmol/L). There was a statistically significant gradient between maternal and fetal glucose concentrations in groups 1 and 3, but no gradient was found in group 2. Maternal and fetal glucose concentrations were significantly correlated in all groups, but the correlations were distinct. For a given maternal glucose concentration, fetal glucose was higher in patients with alloimmunization and lower in patients with intrauterine growth retardation than in normal pregnancies. In patients with intrauterine growth retardation, fetal PO2 correlated positively with fetal glucose and inversely with maternal fetal glucose gradient.\r"

Standard peripheral iridectomy was inadequate for treatment of this angle-closure glaucoma because of the considerably increased thickness of the peripheral cornea that occurs in these patients. Our findings suggest that glaucoma may be more common in the Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome than has been realized and that the initial mechanism is secondary acute or chronic angle closure not related to pupillary block.\r"

The specific diagnosis of some glycoprotein storage diseases was accomplished using lectin staining patterns, and such methods of diagnosis have been attempted for some glycolipid storage diseases. This technique was applied to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded and frozen neural, hepatic, and renal tissues of sheep with an inherited lysosomal storage disease with deficiencies of beta-galactosidase and alpha-neuraminidase. The cytoplasm of central nervous system neurons of affected sheep in paraffin-embedded sections stained with peanut agglutinin (PNA), Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), and soybean agglutinin (SBA). The cytoplasm of neurons in frozen sections of these tissues stained with PNA, RCA-I, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I). The cytoplasm of frozen and paraffin-embedded sections of liver and kidney of affected sheep stained with PNA, whereas paraffin-embedded sections also stained with RCA-I. These results suggest the stored material in this disease has terminal saccharide moieties consisting of beta-galactose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, and N-acetylgalactosamine. Paraffin processing altered lectin staining patterns. Although the staining pattern in this glycolipid storage disease was complex, lectin histochemistry may prove to be a useful technique for the characterization of storage products and for the diagnosis of lysosomal storage diseases.\r"

In the normal appendices, there was a strong staining of the endothelial cells for t-PA, whereas there was negative staining for u-PA. In contrast, the endothelial cells in the inflamed appendices showed u-PA immunoreactivity, and negative or very weak reactions for t-PA. In the inflamed appendix, there was also a labeling of u-PA in fibroblast-like cells and in interstitial areas. The specificity of the staining was supported by a variety of staining controls and also by analysis of tissue extracts with ELISA, showing that on the average the inflamed appendices contained more than twice as much mu-PA per mg of protein as the normal appendices and less than one third of the amount of t-PA.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of a shared epitope between the hemocyanin of the marine mollusk Megathura crenulata, better known as the keyhole limpet, and schistosomula has been reported. This epitope has been shown to be a major immunogen in human infection. In this study, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was used to measure antibodies recognizing the cross-reacting epitopes in sera from patients with acute and chronic schistosomiasis using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Marked differences in IgG and IgM antibody response were noted between acutely and chronically infected patients at a reciprocal serum dilution of up to 2,560. The acute sera had a mean +/- SD OD490 nm values for IgG and IgM of 1.0 +/- 0.44 and 1.34 +/- 0.6 compared to mean +/- SD IgG and IgM absorbance for the chronic sera of 0.22 +/- 0.10 and 0.22 +/- 0.11 respectively. Setting our lowest positive limit at greater than 2 SD above the mean of the chronic sera, 28 of the 30 patients previously diagnosed as having acute schistosomiasis were correctly identified by their IgG and IgM response. Of 5 patients studied longitudinally, IgG persisted at the same levels 10-13 weeks after treatment. IgM levels, on the other hand, showed a tendency to decrease but remained above the established cut-off level. This study provides further evidence for the association of schistosomulum surface carbohydrate antibody with acute infection and demonstrates the ability of a simple non-competitive ELISA using microtiter plates coated with minute quantities of KLH to differentiate serologically between cases of acute and chronic schistosomiasis.\r"

The incidence of malaria, as determined by blood films, was very low in all tribes. Parasitemia levels in most individuals were less than 0.02%; determination of the plasmodial species was not feasible. High levels of antibodies to both blood stages and sporozoites were detected for P. brasilianum/P. malariae, P. falciparum and P. vivax. The anti-sporozoite antibody response against all 3 plasmodial species was age related. All of the Metuktire adults and almost 90% of the Asurini adults had anti-sporozoite antibodies against P. brasilianum/P. malariae. The presence of P. brasilianum was confirmed in many of the indigenous monkeys by blood films and serology. This suggests that the monkeys, which are often kept as pets, serve as reservoir hosts. Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes, infected with P. brasilianum/P. malariae, were found in the study area.\r"

Children with light to moderate S. haematobium infection were examined (Exam 1), assigned at random to groups receiving placebo (PL, n = 104), metrifonate (MT, n = 103, dose 10 mg/kg body weight) or praziquantel (PR, n = 105, dose 40 mg/kg body weight), treated, and examined 8 months later (Exam 2). At Exam 2, 62% of the MT group still passed S. haematobium eggs vs. 13% in the PR group. Egg reduction rates were substantial in both groups, but greater in the PR group; geometric mean egg counts in both groups were very low. Prevalence and intensity in the PL group had not changed between exams. Hookworm egg counts were significantly reduced in the MT group (59% egg reduction rate); malarial infection had increased in all 3 groups, presumably due to the long rainy season between exams. Hookworm egg count was the most significant predictor of initial hemoglobin level, followed by S. haematobium egg count and presence of malarial infection. Treatment with a single dose of MT or PR can produce substantial decreases in S. haematobium infection 8 months later.\r"

Children were re-examined 8 months later. The MT and PR groups gained significantly more than the placebo group in weight, percent weight for age, percent weight for height, arm circumference, and in triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses. The MT and PR groups did not differ significantly from each other. The placebo group showed statistically significant decreases or no change between exams in percent weight for age, percent weight for height, percent arm circumference, and both skinfold thicknesses; the MT and PR groups exhibited highly significant increases in these parameters (P less than 0.0002). The intensity of S. haematobium infection had decreased significantly in both the MT and PR groups, but especially in the PR group. Multiple regression analyses showed that a decrease in the intensity of S. haematobium infection was by far the most important predictor of growth rate after treatment for all 5 anthropometric measures tested; decreases in the intensity of hookworm infection was also significant for 2 of the 5 measures.\r"

The present study examines which subset of T cells is responsible for this modulation. Co-culture of fibroblasts with the total T cell population lead to significant stimulation in fibroblast proliferative activity and a significant decrease in the incorporation of 14C-proline into collagenase-sensitive protein. There was virtually no effect on total incorporation of 14C-proline in non-collagen proteins. An additional significant increase in fibroblast proliferative activity and another significant decrease in collagen synthesis accompanied by a 2-fold increase in non-collagen protein production was noted when fibroblasts were co-cultured with Lyt-1+ cells. Co-culture of fibroblasts with Lyt-2+ cells did not differ significantly from co-culture with total T cells. Mitomycin treatment of the lymphocytes blunted their specific effects, suggesting that proliferation of T cells is required for maximal exertion of their regulatory activity. These results suggest that the T cells which mediate these effects belong to the Lyt-1+ helper class and are distinct from the Lyt-2+ suppressor cells.\r"

Parallel dorsal skin incisions were made 2 days later, and PDGF-BB was applied topically a single time to one of two incisions. In total body-irradiated rats, bone marrow-derived elements were severely depressed, wound macrophages were virtually eliminated, and PDGF-BB treatment was ineffective. However, in surface-irradiated rats, PDGF-BB treatment recruited macrophages into wounds and partially reversed impaired healing on day 7 (p less than 0.005) and day 12 (p less than 0.001). PDGF-BB-treated wounds were 50 percent stronger than the paired control wounds. The results suggest PDGF requires bone marrow-derived cells, likely wound macrophages, for activity and that it may be useful as a topical agent in postirradiation surgical incisions.\r"

In succession, the trachea and esophagus were ventilated with the same inspiratory volume of 621 +/- 45 mL (mean +/- SD). Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, volumes, and temperatures of expired gas were measured from the tracheal and esophageal tubes. End-expired CO2 levels of gases from the trachea and esophagus were 4.9 +/- 0.7% and 0.6 +/- 0.6%, respectively, with CO2 waveforms observed in 7 (33%) patients with esophageal intubations. Volumes expired from the tracheal tube averaged 615 +/- 64 mL and from the esophageal tube 35 +/- 16 mL (P less than 0.001). Peak temperatures of expired gas recorded from the tracheal tube (32.0 +/- 0.73 degrees C) were higher than those from the esophageal tube (27.3 +/- 1.2 degrees C) (P less than 0.001). The shape of temperature waveforms with a correctly placed tracheal tube remained constant with each ventilation, contrary to that obtained from an esophageal tube. Although the occasional detected of CO2 waveforms from an esophageal tube might lead to an incorrect assessment of tube placement, this limitation of CO2 analyzer can be offset by measurement of volume and temperature of expired gas in identifying placement of an endotracheal tube.\r"

  ".W": "Anesthesiologist-reviewers examined 1,175 anesthetic-related closed malpractice claims from 17 professional liability insurance companies. The claims were filed between 1974 and 1988. The reviewers were asked to determine if the negative outcome was preventable by proper use of additional monitoring devices available at the time of the review even if not available at the time the incident occurred, and if so, which devices could have been preventative. In 1,097 cases sufficient information was available to make a judgment regarding preventability of the morbidity or mortality by application of additional monitoring devices. It was determined that 31.5% of the negative outcomes could have been prevented by application of additional monitors. Using the insurance industry's scale of 0 (no injury) to 9 (death), the median severity of injury for incidents deemed preventable was 9 compared with 5 for those deemed not preventable (P less than 0.01, scale detailed in text). The severity of injury scores were the same for preventable mishaps occurring during regional or general anesthesia, suggesting that additional monitoring devices may be equally efficacious in preventing serious negative outcomes during either regional or general anesthesia. The judgements or settlements of the incidents judged preventable by additional monitoring were 11 times more costly (P less than 0.01) than those mishaps not judged preventable. The monitors determined by the reviewers to be most useful in mishap prevention were pulse oximetry plus capnometry. Applied together, these two technologies were considered potentially preventative in 93% of the preventable mishaps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 10 dogs with acute septal ischemia, the posterior wall excursion during contraction (B-C excursion), the mean systolic posterior wall velocity, and the posterior wall excursion remained unaltered. Nitroglycerin, however, increased all these parameters (P less than 0.01). In 10 dogs with acute posterior wall ischemia the B-C excursion (aneurysmal bulging) increased (P less than 0.01), but the mean systolic posterior wall velocity and posterior wall excursion decreased (P less than 0.01). Nitroglycerin increased even more the aneurysmal bulging (P less than 0.01) and the other parameters (P less than 0.01). Increased regional blood flow, reduced afterload, and mechanical pulling of the ischemic myocardium seem to be a possible mechanism. The measurements were obtained using the recently described method of the specific points.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy, tolerance and safety of iloprost, a stable analogue of carbaprostacyclin, were evaluated in 7 patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency at stage II of Fontaine's classification. After washout, placebo was infused intravenously for seven days, then iloprost was given by a six-hour intravenous infusion of 1 ng/kg/min over the next seven days. At the end of each period, the initial (ICD) and the absolute (ACD) claudication distance were measured by treadmill. The ankle/arm systolic blood pressure ratio (WI) was also assessed, at rest and ten minutes after exercise. As compared with placebo, ICD increased from 98 +/- 60 to 137 +/- 91 meters (p less than 0.05) and ACD from 151 +/- 76 to 210 +/- 95 meters (p less than 0.05). Similarly, WI rose from 0.44 +/- 0.14 to 0.52 +/- 0.18 (p less than 0.05) at rest and from 0.40 +/- 0.13 to 0.48 +/- 0.20 (p less than 0.05) ten minutes after treadmill exercise. Owing to the spontaneous fluctuation in walking distance experienced by such patients, an increase in ACD greater than or equal to 50% was considered as clinically relevant. In 3 patients, who experienced such an improvement, iloprost continued to be infused at the same dosage as before, for an additional seven days. In the remaining 4 patients (nonresponders), the dose was increased to 2 ng/kg/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate whether breathlessness induced in normal volunteers by different stimuli represents one or more than one sensation, we studied 30 subjects in whom breathlessness was induced by each of 8 different stimuli: breath-holding, CO2 inhalation, inhalation of CO2, with ventilation voluntarily targeted below the level dictated by chemical drive, breathing with a resistive load, breathing with an elastic load, voluntary elevation of functional residual capacity, voluntary limitation of tidal volume, and exercise. For each stimulus, subjects were asked to choose description of their sensation(s) of breathlessness from a questionnaire listing 19 descriptors. The responses from this questionnaire were evaluated using cluster analysis to search for relationships among descriptors and to identify natural groupings. We found that distinct groups of descriptors emerged, i.e., subjects could distinguish different sensations of breathlessness. In addition, we found an association between certain descriptor groups and stimuli. We conclude that the term breathlessness may encompass multiple sensations, and, therefore, may not be explainable by a single physiologic mechanism.\r"

These cells were made quiescent in medium containing low serum (0.1%) and stimulated to divide by addition of either nanogram quantities or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or medium containing 5% serum. Incorporation of [35S]sulfate into PG was increased during the first 24 h of growth stimulation, and this increase appeared to be principally in the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG). Furthermore, addition of p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xyloside, which perturbs PG metabolism, inhibits cells from proliferating, suggesting that PG may be involved in facilitating cell division. Inhibition of cell proliferation by heparin and/or TGF-beta also causes elevated levels of 35S-sulfate incorporation into PG by these cells. These studies indicate that proteoglycan metabolism is modulated as a function of the growth of arterial smooth muscle cells; however, it is still uncertain whether PG play a direct or indirect role in the control of cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "Reduction in dead space through conventional tracheostomy has been used to treat patients with chronic CO2 retention. The insufflation of air directly into the trachea by transtracheal catheter (airway insufflation, AI) provides reductions in dead space as great or greater than those of tracheostomy. The physiologic effects of AI on gas exchange have not been adequately studied because instillation of gases into the trachea contaminates minute ventilation (VL), dead space volume (VD), tidal volume (VT), and other indices of gas exchange, as measured by usual technics. We overcame this problem by devising special methods of measuring inspired and expired ventilation, alveolar and dead space ventilation, and VT and VD by using pneumotachographic timing of inspiration and expiration so that true inspired and expired ventilation were calculated. We studied 5 patients with chronic CO2 retention from either COPD, scoliosis, or muscular dystrophy (annual average PaCO2 = 45 to 75 mm Hg) during 75 min of AI with serial gas exchange and arterial blood gas measurements. AI at about 5 L/min of room air through the trachea in 5 patients reduced VL by 18% (from 7.91 to 6.48 L/min), VT by 25% (from 450 to 338 ml), and VD by 37% (from 223 to 141 ml), while not affecting PaCO2 (from 51.8 to 48.2 mm Hg) or PaO2 (from 65.1 to 63.4 mm Hg). In 2 patients, AI administered continuously for 4 to 12 months (as 30 to 50% O2) maintained PaCO2 as well as or better than breathing enriched O2 from a tracheal collar via an open tracheostomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Paired measurements of oxygen consumption (VO2), SO2T, and PvO2 were obtained before and after changes in the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) equal to or more than 5 cm H2O. VO2 was measured with a rebreathing circuit adapted to a volume ventilator, and SO2T was calculated from thermodilution CO, PaO2, SaO2, and hemoglobin. In eight studies, CO and PaO2 changed in the same direction, and the absolute change in SO2T averaged 48 +/- 38 ml/min/m2. In 12 studies, CO and PaO2 changed in opposite directions, and the absolute change in SO2T averaged 78 +/- 69 ml/min/m2. When PaO2 and CO changed in the same direction, PvO2 increased on the higher level of SO2T (average difference 3.0 +/- 3.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and there was a strong positive correlation between the difference in SO2T on lower and higher levels of PEEP and the difference in PvO2 (r = 0.83). When PaO2 and CO changed in opposite directions, PvO2 was unchanged on the higher level of SO2T, and there was no correlation between the difference in SO2T on lower and higher levels of PEEP and the difference in PvO2 (r = -0.45). VO2 was not different at the lower and higher levels of SO2T in both groups, indicating that VO2 was not transport-limited in these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven atopic asthmatics underwent allergen challenge after low dose aspirin to suppress platelet thromboxane generation and on placebo days. On placebo days, the urinary levels of 2,3-dinor-TxB2 increased from 76 +/- 22 pg/mg creatinine to 216 +/- 95 after allergen, and 11-dehydro-TxB2 from 396 +/- 98 to 627 +/- 137 (p less than 0.05). Low dose aspirin suppressed excretion of urinary thromboxane metabolites and prevented the rise after allergen inhalation without altering the bronchoconstriction. Excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha, a metabolite of prostacyclin, was unaltered by this aspirin regimen. We conclude that platelets are activated after allergen challenge, but that platelet-derived TxA2 is not important in the early bronchoconstrictor response.\r"

Free IgM was detected 4 days after infection, remained at low levels, and disappeared on Day 64, whereas free IgG was first detected on Day 7 and rose to very high levels before declining on Day 64. Free IgA was detected only once, on Day 21. IC containing IgM were seen first on Day 4, remained at low levels, and became undetectable on Day 64. IC containing IgM were detected on Day 7, peaked on Day 14, and declined through Day 64. IC containing IgA wee seen at low levels on Days 7, 14, and 21. Estimation of total IgA levels, done by single radial immunodiffusion, showed a statistically significant decrease on Day 14, followed by a slightly significant increase on Days 21 and 30. Antigen was detected in as much as 80% of serum specimens and 100% of urine samples during the first 2 wk postinfection but rarely afterwards. We conclude that ELISA provides a highly sensitive way to study antibody, IC, and antigen in host body fluids during histo infection and that IgM and antigen detection can be very early indices of infection. Measurements of IC and total IgA seem to be of relatively less importance in detection of infection.\r"

Both preparations were obtained from Enterobacter agglomerans, which is a major bacterial species in many organic dusts. The major physiologic effect caused was a dose-related decrease in transfer factor, as measured by carbon monoxide diffusion. Half of the subjects reported fever and about one-third a subjective feeling of chest tightness. The exposure also caused a dose-related but small decrease in FEV1. A slightly increased bronchial reactivity was demonstrated at 4 h after endotoxin exposure. The minute volume after CO2 exposure was marginally affected. The results further support the conclusions from epidemiologic and experimental studies that the bacterial endotoxin is responsible for the acute reactions seen after exposure to many organic dusts, including that derived from cotton.\r"

In the prospective study, 249 consecutive classified immigrants who were considered on the basis of clinical and roentgenographic findings to have nonprogressive tuberculosis submitted at least two sputums for culture: 13 (5.2%) had at least one culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Immigrants younger than 50 yr of age and refugees from Kampuchea and Laos had a fivefold to tenfold elevated risk of having a positive sputum culture. The cost per case detected of obtaining and processing sputum cultures was estimated to be +1,996 to +2,994. In the case-control study, 37 classified immigrants evaluated from 1981 through 1986 who had sputum cultures positive for M. tuberculosis even though they fulfilled clinical and roentgenographic criteria for nonprogressive tuberculosis served as control subjects. Several demographic, clinical, and roentgenographic factors were associated with an increased risk of being culture-positive: age younger than 50 yr, a positive tuberculin test, report of a cough, and a cavitary lesion on chest roentgenogram. The history of prior receipt of antituberculosis drugs was associated with having a negative culture, including a marked dose-response effect.\r"

The probe used includes the nucleotide sequence coding for the amino acids recognized by the well-characterized tau monoclonal antibodies 5E2 and tau 1. The distribution of the tau RNA is abundant throughout the neuronal somata and into the proximal parts of dendrites of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. The distal extent to which silver grains could be visualized in the pyramidal cell dendrite was comparable to that seen with a probe to ribosomal RNA. In contrast to the tau probe the ribosomal probe also labeled glial cells. Sections hybridized with the tau probe and then double-labeled with thioflavine S revealed that neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles continue to synthesize tau protein.\r"

Future research on the association of antiphospholipid antibodies with neurological disease should focus on establishing the pathogenicity of these antibodies, identifying groups at high risk for recurrent ischemic cerebrovascular events, and initiating prospective multicenter natural history and treatment protocols.\r"

We studied the in vitro bactericidal activities and PAEs of the following drugs: daptomycin compared with penicillin G and vancomycin, without and with gentamicin against Enterococcus faecalis strains; daptomycin compared with nafcillin and vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains; and daptomycin compared with vancomycin against methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains. Daptomycin, alone and when used in combination with gentamicin, exhibited greater bactericidal activity and in general produced a longer PAE than standard effective regimens against the organism strains studied.\r"

In contrast, liposome swelling assays using imipenem at 8 mM detected no significant difference between the imipenem-resistant mutants and their parents. It was found that the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa has a saturable specific channel through which imipenem travels mainly at low concentrations, whereas at high concentrations this pathway is obscured by diffusion through nonspecific porin channels.\r"

Three hours later, chambers were removed and their contents were assessed for viable counts. Controls revealed that tobramycin levels in the chambers were 3.8 micrograms/ml 15 min after injection of 15 mg of tobramycin per kg and remained above the in vitro MICs (0.5 to 1 microgram/ml) for the tested strains for 8 h. It was demonstrated that tobramycin therapy was less effective with higher inocula and with longer delay before administration. Thus, in vivo, the concentration of bacteria in the chambers at the time of the first tobramycin injection had a profound effect on the bactericidal efficacy of tobramycin therapy. No such concentration dependence was observed in mock in vitro therapy experiments. A phage-selected mucoid derivative of P. aeruginosa PAO1 showed only a marginal increase in in vitro aminoglycoside susceptibility and no major alteration in in vivo susceptibility compared with its isogenic nonmucoid parent strain.\r"

SM7338 was at least as active as imipenem against gram-negative organisms but was slightly less active against gram-positive organisms. SM7338 was particularly active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with MICs for 90% of strains of less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for all species tested. Differences in activity between SM7338 and imipenem were particularly striking against Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii, against which MICs of SM7338 and imipenem for 90% of strains were 0.125 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The presence of unique plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PU21 transconjugants did not affect activity substantially, except in the case of OXA-2 (eightfold-increased MIC) and OXA-3 (fourfold-increased MIC). SM7338 was also active against a laboratory-derived strain of P. aeruginosa which hyperproduced chromosomal beta-lactamase, inhibiting both the wild type and the mutant at a concentration of 1.0 micrograms/ml.\r"

  ".U": "90024991\r", 
  ".W": "The commonly accepted hypothesis explaining the mechanism of action of pyrazinamide (PZA) is based on the assumption that PZA-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains produce pyrazinamidase, which hydrolyzes PZA to the antibacterial moiety pyrazinoic acid (POA). It is not clear whether POA has specific antimicrobial activity or the inhibition of growth caused by POA is due to its ability to lower the pH of the environment below the limits of tolerance of M. tuberculosis growth. We confirmed in this study that POA, depending on the concentration, lowered the pH of 7H12 broth (pH 6.0), which ranged from 5.8 at 120.0 micrograms/ml to 4.6 at 960.0 micrograms/ml. Therefore, we tested the inhibitory effects of different concentrations of POA in broth in which the final pH was adjusted to 5.6 by adding appropriate amounts of phosphoric acid or dipotassium phosphate. Under these conditions, we found a clear dose-response correlation, proving that POA does have specific antimicrobial activity. The MIC of POA at pH 5.6 was 240 to 480 micrograms/ml, 8- to 16-fold higher than the MIC of PZA under the same conditions and much higher than the concentrations achievable in humans. This suggests that the action of POA in an acid environment is a combined effect of its specific activity and its ability to lower the pH below the limits of tolerance of the target organism.\r"

All four drugs were highly bactericidal against M. tuberculosis, with low MBC/MIC ratios and MBCs significantly lower than the maximum achievalbe concentrations in serum (Cmax). In contrast, all four drugs had very low bactericidal activities against M. avium: the broth-determined MBCs were significantly higher than the Cmax. On a basis of comparisons with the broth-determined MICs found for susceptible M. tuberculosis strains and with the Cmax, about one-third of 100 M. avium strains tested can be tentatively considered as susceptible to three aminoglycosides (streptomycin, amikacin, and kanamycin) but not to capreomycin. In regard to the MBCs and MICs, the three aminoglycosides tested have about identical potentials as drugs of choice in combination with other drugs for chemotherapy of M. avium disease. The low bactericidal activities of these drugs against M. avium in vitro do not exclude their therapeutic usefulness, because they may produce a synergistic effect in combination with other drugs. Such an option is especially promising for patients whose isolates can be considered susceptible on the basis of the MIC. We found no differences in susceptibility to the four drugs tested for M. avium strains (identified by Gen-Probe) isolated from 50 patients with and 50 patients without acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\r"

For some cases (staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis), the dosage was 8 to 14.4 mg/kg per day and/or other antibiotics were given. The mean duration was 48.2 days (range, 23 to 130 days). Of 23 patients, 21 (91.3%) had negative cultures or were cured. A total of 18 patients were treated with teicoplanin alone; of these, 4 had surgery, and all (except 2 who relapsed) were cured. Teicoplanin was combined with one or more antibiotics in five cases; in all cases appropriate cultures were negative, but three patients died during therapy or follow-up. Mild renal impairment was seen in two patients; both were receiving teicoplanin in combination with an aminoglycoside. We conclude that intravenous teicoplanin administered once a day at doses of 7 to 14 mg/kg per day is well tolerated, easy to administer, and may represent an efficacious therapy for gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis.\r"

A 0.5-kb fragment internal to ermP was 32P labeled and used as an ermP-specific probe in DNA hybridization experiments which used target DNA prepared from representatives of each of the known erm classes and also from erythromycin-resistant isolates of a variety of clostridial species. Hybridizing sequences were detected in DNA from several Clostridium difficile isolates and a Clostridium paraputrificum strain; however, ermP was not widespread in erythromycin-resistant C. perfringens isolates. The ermP determinant hybridized to, and shared significant restriction identity with, the ermB class gene from the streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1.

MRSA constituted 38% of all S. aureus isolates in our 25-bed burns unit despite the utilization of a combination of 1% silver sulfadiazine and 0.2% chlorhexidine as topical therapy. Mupirocin, a new antibiotic, has proved in vitro and in vivo to be highly effective in the treatment of MRSA infections. A prospective clinical trial with mupirocin ointment in MRSA burn wound infection was untertaken. Forty-five children with 59 discrete burn wounds and from whom MRSA were isolated were treated with 2% mupirocin ointment under occlusive dressings, applied twice daily for 5 days. The average burned area treated was 8% (range, 2 to 20%) of the total body surface area. The burn wounds were assessed clinically and bacteriologically daily. Mupirocin eliminated MRSA in all 59 wounds treated, with the maximum therapeutic response seen within 4 days. In three wounds, gram-negative organisms persisted after 5 days of topical therapy. Treatment was well tolerated by all children. We recommend that mupirocin in its present polyethylene glycol base should be used only on a selective basis, when current prophylactic topical therapy has failed to control MRSA infection in burns of less than 20% of the total body surface area, and that it should be applied only for a limited period of 5 days. The safety and the efficacy of mupirocin in burns exceeding 20% of the total body surface area need to be established.\r"

Ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and aztreonam were the most active. MICs for burn isolates were consistently higher than those for other isolates for most antibiotics, whereas those for CF strains were consistently lower. Multidrug resistance to aminoglycosides and beta-lactams occurred in 21% of the burn isolates, 2.6% of the CF isolates, and 8.9% of the other isolates. Ninety percent of these strains remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Seven percent of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC, greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). Concurrent resistance to ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams or aminoglycosides was rare (1.8 to 4%). Analysis by Spearman rank correlation revealed a high degree of correlation of MICs among antibiotics within the same class, except for imipenem. An inoculum effect was observed for all antibiotics between 10(6) and 10(4) CFU (P less than 0.05), with those for piperacillin and cefoperazone being the most pronounced (16-fold and 8-fold differences, respectively), and was least apparent for the quinolones, aminoglycosides, imipenem, and aztreonam (twofold differences). Selected strains for which there were high MICs of ciprofloxacin (greater than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml) were tested against ciprofloxacin in combination with other agents in a checkerboard agar dilution assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several diseases are included in the category of hypomelanosis. Their clinical course as well as the pathogenesis are diverse and in many cases poorly understood. The aim of the present study is to use the nude mice model to determine whether the primary defect in various pigmentary skin disorders is inherent to the tissue itself or is secondary to systemic factors. Split-thickness skin grafts obtained from patients with vitiligo, acquired hypomelanosis guttata, and tyrosinase-negative albinism were grafted onto nude mice. Histologic examination and dopa staining were performed prior to and following the engraftment. The dopa staining was performed on the epidermal sheet following separation from the dermis. The depigmented area of the vitiligo became completely pigmented 6 to 10 weeks after skin transplantation. The dopa reaction that was negative prior to skin engraftment became completely positive after the transplantation. The number of melanocytes (expressed per square millimeter of skin surface) 8 weeks after transplantation was 197 +/- 73 mm2. Dopa reaction in acquired hypomelanosis guttata showed reduction of the number of melanocytes in the depigmented macula as compared with the surrounding area (55.25 +/- 18.00 mm2 vs 220 +/- 28.28 mm2. Twenty days after skin transplantation, repigmentation of the area was observed. The number of melanocytes increased significantly (388.75 +/- 213 mm2). The grafted skin obtained from patients with tyrosinase-negative albinism showed persistence of the depigmentation after skin transplantation. Dopa reaction was negative prior to and 8 weeks after transplantation. The results of the present study suggest that systemic factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo and acquired hypomelanosis guttata.\r"
