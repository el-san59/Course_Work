  ".W": "We studied the natural history of brain air embolism by observing bubbles in the pial vessels of rabbits and the effect of different doses of intracarotid air on brain function and blood flow. We identified and then studied two doses of air; 25 microliters in five rabbits caused rapid bubble transit, recovery, and then deterioration in brain function and blood flow and 400 microliters in five rabbits caused temporary bubble trapping and sustained deterioration in brain function. These dose responses correlate well with the natural history of divers with air embolism of the brain. All doses of air caused both arteriolar dilatation and reduced blood flow, which were independent of dose, whereas the detrimental effect of air embolism of brain function was dose dependent. Our results suggest that this is a good model of brain air embolism.\r"

  ".W": "Using quantitative autoradiography, we studied sequential changes in regional cerebral blood flow during and after 2 minutes of bilateral common carotid artery occlusions in 18 gerbils. Occlusion (n = 4) led to severe ischemia in the forebrain (regional cerebral blood flow less than 5% of control [n = 4]) and midbrain (regional cerebral blood flow less than 10% of control), but was morphologically nonlethal. Reperfusion of the brain was complete, and regional cerebral blood flow was not different from control 1 minute after ischemia (n = 4), but hypoperfusion (regional cerebral blood flow 30-50% of control) occurred at 5 minutes (n = 3) and was pronounced at 1 hour (n = 4); at this stage blood flow was inhomogeneous. Hypoperfusion had disappeared at 4 hours (n = 3). Our results indicate that the well-documented sequence of cerebral blood flow changes (i.e., ischemia, initial recovery of blood flow, and delayed hypoperfusion) takes place even after nonlethal cerebral ischemia.\r"

Using magnetic resonance imaging, we evaluated six patients who demonstrated poor filling or lack of filling of one or both lateral sinuses at angiography. In each patient, magnetic resonance imaging unambiguously demonstrated either lateral sinus thrombosis or lateral sinus hypoplasia. The latter was characterized by a frank asymmetry in size (surface of section) of the transverse portion of the lateral sinuses on parasagittal images without any abnormal signal in the course of the sinus. Lateral sinus thrombosis was indicated by increased intraluminal signal on all planes and with all pulse sequences. By virtue of its freedom from bone-related artifact, its multiplanar imaging capability, and its sensitivity to both blood flow and thrombus formation, magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent tool for the evaluation of lateral sinus thrombosis or hypoplasia.\r"

During the previous 10 days, he had experienced three episodes of left leg numbness and incoordination that occurred either alone or in association with right arm and leg weakness. Computed tomography showed infarcts in the right frontoparietal (parasagittal), left frontal, and left parietal lobes. Cerebral angiography revealed 60% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery, 80% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery, absence of the A1 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery, filling of the right anterior cerebral artery from the left carotid circulation only, and a normal vertebrobasilar system. This report illustrates that leg weakness may occur ipsilateral to carotid disease if the contralateral anterior cerebral artery is supplied by the ipsilateral carotid artery.\r"

Ten days later, positron emission tomography performed at rest showed decreased oxygen metabolism and blood flow at the site of the anatomic lesion and in remote areas such as the ipsilateral frontotemporoparietal cortex and the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. Cerebellar hypometabolism has been ascribed to functional disconnection of the contralateral hemisphere from the cerebral cortex and has been termed crossed cerebellar diaschisis. One month later, positron emission tomography performed during unilateral motor activation (finger opposition) showed increased blood flow in the sensorimotor and supplementary motor areas contralateral to the hand engaged in the motor task. An at-rest study at this time showed resolution of the crossed cerebellar diaschisis observed acutely, but cerebellar asymmetry was demonstrated during performance of the motor task with the normal as well as with the previously paretic hand. Our activation study demonstrated cerebellar asymmetry in the chronic phase during a motor task, even though resting cerebellar blood flow was symmetrical. This observation reveals the dynamic, functional nature of crossed cerebellar diaschisis and may partially explain the lack of any clinical counterpart in functional studies of the cerebellum performed with the patient at rest.\r"

Group 1 consisted of 45 nondrinkers, Group 2 of 51 social drinkers, and Group 3 of 20 habitual drinkers with a daily intake of more than 60 g of ethanol for at least ten years. The frequency of chronic active hepatitis (CAH) in Group 3 was higher than in Groups 1 and 2 (P less than 0.05). The histologic comparison of patients with CAH between the three groups revealed that only the inflammatory changes at/near portal tracts, such as piecemeal necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration in Group 3, were more prominent than those in Groups 1 and 2. The alcohol-related changes except for fatty change were not found in any specimens. These findings suggest that alcohol intake, particularly of more than 60 g of ethanol a day, may enhance the viral inflammatory changes of the liver in patients with persistent HBs-antigenemia.\r"

The entire experiment was repeated twice at two-week intervals, with the dose of ASA increased to 325 mg and finally 3,900 mg. The mean increase was maximal at 4 and 12 hours, regardless of the dose administered, with a return to baseline by 48 hours. The authors then performed bleeding times in a prospective randomized double-blinded fashion on an additional 39 subjects at baseline and seven hours after they ingested either placebo or ASA 325 mg. The mean baseline bleeding time was 5.2 minutes (SD +/- 1.4), with a mean prolongation after ASA of 2.1 minutes (SD +/- 1.9). The authors identified 5 of 37 (14%) subjects as hyper-responders (HRs) using the criterion of a bleeding time prolongation of greater than 5.9 minutes (greater than 2 SD beyond the mean prolongation). Neither baseline bleeding time, threshold sensitivity of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, nor other tests of hemostatic function discriminated HRs from normals. The authors conclude that in subjects with normal baseline bleeding times, a prolongation of greater than 5.9 minutes when measured seven hours after the administration of a single dose of 325 mg of ASA can discriminate HRs from normals.\r"

Seven commercial APTT reagents were used for duplicate determinations in 30 normal controls, 26 patients with liver disease, and 33 patients on full-dose heparin treatment. Clotting times were longer with the manual method than with ACL 810 and, to a lesser extent, with KoaguLab 40 A. Average imprecision of duplicate determinations (coefficient of variation [CV]) was less with ACL 810 (less than 1.5%) than with KoaguLab 40 A (2.9%) and the manual method (2.4%). Differences in slope of the regression curves of clotting times obtained with the coagulometers over the tilt-tube method were observed with all the reagents tested (P less than 0.01). Transformation of clotting times of controls, patients with liver disease, and patients on heparin therapy to APTT ratios did not eliminate the bias resulting from the different reagents (P less than 0.001) and clot-detection methods (P less than 0.001); in controls, significant (P less than 0.001) reagent-method interaction was also observed. The in vitro heparin sensitivity differed with the APTT reagents evaluated and was influenced by the clot-detection method used. Transformation of APTT ratios of anticoagulated patients to apparent plasma heparin levels--as derived from in vitro dose-response curves--effectively eliminated the bias resulting from the different clot-detection methods but had no effect on the bias resulting from the different APTT reagents. In vitro heparin activity curves thus have little, if any, relevance for the ex vivo monitoring of heparin treatment.\r"

The splenic lesion was detected before the resection of the primary lung lesion during a complete metastatic work-up. At that time, however, it was considered unlikely that the mass in the spleen represented a metastasis because of the lack of metastatic disease elsewhere.\r"

Despite the lack of branching papillary clusters described in previous reports, it was possible to suggest the correct diagnosis by identifying these other characteristic features. In addition, estrogen and progesterone receptor levels were measured and found to be negligible. A review of the literature with emphasis on cytologic features also is presented.\r"

Ninety-four percent fulfilled criteria for the risk of significant morbidity: cardiac, pulmonary, or immunodeficiency conditions (38%); an age of 6 weeks or younger (35%); or severe illness (21%). Severe illness was defined as hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or marked tachypnea. Of those treated because of underlying conditions, 71% had RSV documented, as did 71% of patients aged 6 weeks or younger and 81% of patients with severe disease. A study of 80 consecutive patients who were hospitalized with illness compatible with RSV infection revealed that 56% of patients were treated with ribavirin. Adherence to guidelines led to ribavirin use in half of the hospitalized patients with suspected RSV infection. The majority of these patients received therapy because of underlying conditions or very young age.\r"

  ".W": "One compensatory mechanism for marginal zinc intake may be through an enhanced absorption of zinc. Such a compensatory mechanism could be of value to the neonate, as poor zinc nutriture during early life has severe consequences on growth and development. We studied the uptake of zinc by 3-month-old infant rhesus monkeys born to dams fed control diets (100 micrograms of zinc per gram of diet or zinc-restricted diets (4 micrograms of zinc per gram of diet). Zinc uptake/retention was studied by feeding 3-month-old infant monkeys that had fasted an infant formula containing zinc 65 by gavage. Whole body radioactivity was counted immediately after intubation and on days 10 and 17 after intubation. Regardless of dietary group, 65 zinc retention was high, ranging from 33% to 71% of the dose fed to the monkeys. There were no significant differences between the two dietary groups in the percentage of zinc retention at days 10 and 17. Independent of the dietary group, there was no correlation between plasma zinc and zinc absorption. A positive correlation was found between weight gain and zinc retention in the marginal zinc infants, while a negative correlation between weight gain and zinc retention was observed in the control infants. These observations suggest that the mechanisms underlying growth may be different in infants born to dams fed control vs marginal zinc diets.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that poor, urban parents are often unable to identify the presence of fever by use of a mercury glass thermometer. We investigated whether 145 mothers whose children received care in an urban hospital ambulatory care center could accurately read a thermometer. If they could not, their ability to identify zones of temperature, either by use of colors or numbers, was assessed. Although 57.9% of parents owned a mercury glass thermometer, only 9.7% could accurately read three thermometers presented to them. When those parents who were unable to accurately read were asked to identify the zones of temperature within which the mercury fell, 87.0% could successfully identify number zones; 78.6% could correctly identify color zones. Teaching the zone-reading techniques required only 15 to 30 seconds. We conclude that for parents unable to read a thermometer by conventional means, the use of color zones or number zones is a technique that is easily taught and reliably carried out.\r"

This study examines the relationship between the concentration of serum sodium and germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage in 299 premature infants with birth weights of less than 1500 g during the first 4 days of life. Intraventricular hemorrhage developed in 34 (32%) of the 106 infants with maximum serum sodium levels of 145 mmol/L or less and in 54 (28%) of 193 infants whose highest serum sodium levels were greater than 145 mmol/L (chi 2 = 0.37). These data suggest that concentrations of serum sodium greater than 145 mmol/L are not associated with an increased risk of germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage in the premature newborn. Consequently, more liberal administration of fluids to maintain extravascular cerebral tissue pressure is unlikely to reduce the incidence of germinal matrix hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage.\r"

Of them, 87 (76%) were less than 1 year and 107 (94%) were less than 2 years of age. Signs of severe lower respiratory infections, namely tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 50/min) and subcostal retraction, were present in 95% and 93%, respectively. Of 88 children of whom roentgenographs were taken, 30 (34%) had evidence of pneumonia. No clinical signs discriminated between those with and without pneumonia. By culture or immunofluorescence antigen detection, viruses were found in 81 (71%) children with bronchiolitis; respiratory syncytial virus was the most common agent, found in 65 (57%). Parainfluenza viruses were the next most common, found in 12 (11%). Most cases of bronchiolitis occurred in outbreaks during the rainy months of August through November, coinciding with respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks. Although bacterial culture of blood was done in 56 children, no respiratory pathogen was isolated. In one child with bronchiolitis and consolidation, postmortem lung aspirate yielded Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, bronchiolitis is primarily a viral syndrome in this tropical region, just as it is in temperate regions. Eight (7%) children died (all were infants); 5 had roentgenographic pneumonia and the remaining had other abnormalities contributing to death; all had been treated with antibiotics. Since one third of lower respiratory infections are bronchiolitis, and among infants under 1 year of age bronchiolitis comprises 47% of all lower respiratory infection cases, criteria for antibiotic management must take into account the availability of roentgenographic investigation.\r"

Cultures were obtained in infants assigned to the gowning and nongowning groups within 6 hours of birth from the anterior part of the nares and the base of the umbilicus and at the time of discharge from the nursery. There were 102 infants in the gowning group and 100 infants in the nongowning group. No significant differences were noted between the two groups with respect to sex, length of stay, mode of delivery, weight, or status of nursery admission culture results. The use of gowns on a postpartum ward failed to decrease nose or umbilical colonization when compared with infants in the nongowning group. Seventy (68.6%) of 102 infants in the gowning group and 65 (65%) of 100 infants in the nongowning group had negative umbilical cord cultures on admission to the nursery that became positive at discharge. On follow-up, no differences were noted between the two groups with respect to their health. Only one infant in each group had an infection develop in the first 4 weeks of life. We conclude that the routine use of cover gowns on postpartum units in healthy full-term infants is ineffective and costly. It may discourage health care providers from examining patients and providing care.\r"

While only 9% of surveyed physicians measured blood cholesterol levels routinely, 72% screened children with family histories of cardiovascular disease. The majority routinely measured blood pressure, but the ages of first measurements differed among physicians. Surprisingly, of those who had treated children with elevated blood pressure or blood cholesterol, 54% said that they had ever used antihypertensive and 12% used lipid-lowering drugs in children, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and clofibrate. Half the surveyed physicians felt prepared to provide dietary counseling, but only 14% felt successful with it. When asked what they considered were the major cardiovascular risk factors, less than one third of the physicians cited all three major factors: hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking.\r"

There was no significant change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (46.4 +/- 1.9 mg/dL vs 44.3 +/- 2.1 mg/dL) or in triglyceride concentrations (94.2 +/- 7.43 mg/dL vs 102.2 +/- 8.45 mg/dL). In addition, the reduction in serum lipoprotein concentrations resulting from this program was significantly greater than the concentrations resulting from the American Heart Association diet alone. The different responses to these regimens suggest that a simplified diet and soluble fiber supplementation is well tolerated and reduces total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels more effectively than the standard American Heart Association diet in children.\r"

Analysis indicated that the data were gaussian in distribution and that no significant skewing or kurtosis was noted in any group for either maternal or paternal heights. The mean height of mothers in group 1 (mean +/- SD, 157.7 +/- 6.8 cm) was less than (F = 14.36) the mean height of mothers in either group 2 (mean +/- SD, 161.1 +/- 6.9 cm) or group 3 (mean +/- SD, 162.5 +/- 6.6 cm).

Thus, a significant shift to greater shortness in mothers' heights than in fathers' heights for the parents of children with genetic short stature was noted. Such a differential shortness was not detected in the parents of children with a constitutional delay of growth.\r"

Two patients eventually recovered 20/20 visual acuity despite the presence of subretinal fluid in the fovea at the time of diagnosis. The diagnosis was made at 11 and 14 months of age, and follow-up periods were ten and seven years, respectively. One case was sporadic and the other was hereditary. Both patients were treated with external radiation; one patient was also treated with chemotherapy. The lesions regressed markedly after treatment. These cases demonstrate that visual prognosis in macular retinoblastomas is not uniformly poor even when a foveal detachment is present. Visual acuity may be good in some cases, which supports the merits of medical treatment rather than enucleation in selected patients.\r"

The patient had a sudden loss of visual acuity to R.E.: counting fingers. Visual fields demonstrated a central scotoma, and retrobulbar neuritis was diagnosed. When vision failed to improve spontaneously, however, radiologic studies were performed. These showed compromise of the optic canal by bony proliferation and an apparent mucocele at the orbital apex. Surgical exploration disclosed fibrous dysplastic bone and a cystic structure overlying the optic nerve. Successful surgical excision of the cyst and debulking of the fibrous dysplasia resulted in visual acuity returning to R.E.: 20/25.\r"

This technique for subretinal foreign body removal is preferable to creating a large posterior retinotomy overlying the foreign body because of the potential risks of further macular trauma, hemorrhage, or proliferation of periretinal membranes from the retinotomy site.\r"

Intraocular pressure decreased from 31.3 +/- 8.8 mm Hg (range, 20 to 47 mm Hg) to 17.0 +/- 3.7 mm Hg (range, 8 to 22 mm Hg). The length of follow-up ranged from two to 31 months. The results in 11 of 12 patients (91.6%) were satisfactory, defined by an intraocular pressure of 22 mm Hg or less, with or without antiglaucoma medications, and requiring no subsequent procedures for control of intraocular pressure. The success rates and overall pressure lowering effect of the seven patients receiving and the five patients not receiving 5-fluorouracil were similar. However, most patients receiving 5-fluorouracil were thought to be at higher risk for surgical failure. Complications of needle revision were minor and resolved without sequelae. We advocate the consideration of transconjunctival needle revision with or without the use of 5-fluorouracil as a useful therapeutic modality in the management of the failed or failing filtering bleb.\r"

Before iridotomy, the iris contour was convex anteriorly in all meridians. After iridotomy, the anterior lens surface position did not change perceptibly. The iris at the pupil margin settled backward onto the lens surface, no longer held forward by the narrow stream of aqueous passing from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber. Next to the pupil there was often a perceptible mound, presumably representing the iris sphincter. From the point of support by the lens to the root of the iris, the contour of the iris surface was a straight line, except for the surface irregularities. The deepening of the anterior chamber at each point was the difference between the convex contour before iridotomy and the straight line after iridotomy.\r"

In most cases, however, treatment fails because these lenses are not large enough to cover the filtering bleb. We evaluated the use of a newly developed large diameter (20.5 mm) therapeutic soft contact lens. Five patients with shallow anterior chambers and ten patients with leaking filtering blebs after trabeculectomy were fitted with this new extended-wear contact lens. All patients with shallow anterior chambers developed deep chambers after a mean treatment period of five days. Of the ten patients with leaking filtering blebs, in eight (80%) the leak closed after a mean treatment period of 2.2 months. The contact lens used was comfortable and complications occurred in only one eye. This new therapeutic device is an improvement in the treatment of complications after trabeculectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Disposable contact lenses are inexpensive hydrogel lenses that are approved for both daily and extended wear. Confusion may exist regarding the physical properties of disposable contact lenses. We used the single-chamber polarographic oxygen permeability measurement method, corrected for both boundary and edge effects, to determine objectively the oxygen permeability of three brands of disposable contact lenses. The oxygen permeability values determined for each lens material are as follows: Acuvue, 18 x 10(-11) cm2 ml O2/sec ml mm Hg (Dk); NewVues, 15 x 10(-11) Dk; and SeeQuence, 9 x 10(-11) Dk. This demonstrates that the inexpensive production techniques, which confer a relatively low unit expense, do not change the physical properties of the hydrogel materials as they relate to oxygen permeability and transmissibility. We concluded that hypoxic stress to the cornea is just as likely when using a disposable contact lens as it is when using a conventional reusable soft hydrogel lens of similar composition and water content.\r"

The fissure narrowing sign correlates with known anatomic deficiencies in the Treacher Collins syndrome and may prove valuable in confirming the diagnosis in patients who lack certain typical features.\r"

In addition to a standard ophthalmologic and orthoptic examination, we determined the stimulus accommodative convergence/accommodation (AC/A) ratio by using the gradient method over a range of 6 diopters, the near point of accommodation, and random dot stereopsis. Hypermetropic patients without esotropia or significant esophoria were found to have a low AC/A ratio in contrast to those patients with refractive accommodative esotropia. This finding explains why esodeviations may be absent in some hypermetropic patients with uncorrected vision. We found a high prevalence of abnormally low near points of accommodation and defective or absent stereopsis in both groups of patients.\r"

Using 20/30 visual acuity or better as the criterion for normal visual acuity, eight eyes with letter visual acuities ranging from 20/42 to 20/138 would have been inaccurately found to be normal by using the Teller visual acuity cards alone. Grating visual acuity measurements tended to be better than letter visual acuity; and, in general, they did not worsen proportionately with poorer letter visual acuity.\r"

The duration of symptoms before examination ranged from one to 13 months. None of the parents were able to identify temporally related stressful events. Reassurance alone was given to both parents and children; eyelid pulling resolved in all cases within two weeks. In only the youngest patient did eyelid pulling recur and no child developed other symptoms during a follow-up of six to 15 months. Following resolution, parents believed their children pulled on the eyelids to gain attention or because their eyes were initially irritated and they then developed a \"bad habit.\" Children said they did it to \"look funny\" or because their \"eyes were not opening enough.\"\r"

In order to develop such a staging system we reviewed the prognostic variables and the accuracy of radiographic diagnosis in 39 patients undergoing temporal bone resection for squamous carcinoma of the external auditory meatus. Predictors of poor survival were extensive tumor involvement, facial nerve paralysis, middle ear involvement, and cervical or periparotid lymphadenopathy. In a comparison of 12 specific anatomic sites, computed tomography was found to be an accurate indicator of histopathologically proven tumor invasion. On the basis of this clinical radiographic-histopathologic analysis, we propose a TNM staging system for external auditory meatus carcinoma utilizing preoperative computed tomography and physical examination. This system fulfills the requirements of the American Joint Committee on Cancer that a staging system should provide a sound basis for therapeutic planning for cancer patients by describing the survival and resultant treatment of different patient groups in comparable form.\r"

One patient, who had had a previous vestibular nerve section without improvement, underwent microvascular decompression of the stump as well as decompression of the opposite side with no relief: 3 of these 9 patients had clear signs of bilateral vestibular nerve compression, but elected not to undergo a second procedure at that time. One patient lost hearing as a result of the operation, and 1 who had a second operation suffered a hearing loss and subsequently underwent vestibular nerve section with improvement of the symptoms. Two patients had transient deficits related to cranial nerves IV and X. The remaining patients had no complications from the operation.\r"

All children had severe drooling associated with cerebral palsy or mental retardation. Follow-up at 7 years showed satisfactory control of sialorrhea in 16 of 18 patients (89%). There was one major complication: xerostomia. Our results indicate that submandibular gland excision together with parotid duct retropositioning provides effective control of sialorrhea in most cases.

The differential diagnosis is important, since immediate recompression is indicated for inner ear DCS, while it is contraindicated in cases of inner ear barotrauma. We have found no cases reported in the world literature in which both diseases have been diagnosed and proven simultaneously. We present a case of a diver who developed DCS with inner ear manifestations complicated by a round window fistula.

Therefore, the dose-response relationships for contact sensitization were determined for 22 patients (10 men) with minimal atopic eczema and compared with those from 27 nonatopic, healthy control subjects (12 men). Sensitization was induced with 30 micrograms of dinitrochlorobenzene applied to the thigh. Four weeks later the subjects were challenged with three doses of dinitrochlorobenzene (8.8, 12.5, and 17.7 micrograms), and responses were quantified with calipers as change in skinfold thickness at 48 hours. Atopic patients were significantly less responsive with smaller reactions at all challenge doses and a flatter challenge dose-response curve than that for control subjects. Thus, proper quantitative comparisons have shown that subjects with minimal atopic eczema do not mount a normal contact hypersensitivity response. However, it is not clear whether this is a consequence of the atopic state per se or is related to the presence of even a minor degree of eczema.\r"

  ".U": "90372676\r", 
  ".W": "Recently, a monoclonal antibody, 19-DEJ-1, has been described with binding specificity for an epitope present within the mid-lamina lucida of the dermoepidermal junction directly underneath hemidesmosomes, suggesting recognition of a portion of the anchoring filaments. In an initial survey of specimens from patients with inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB), it was noted that 9 of 9 specimens of Herlitz junctional EB and approximately 50% of specimens of recessive dystrophic EB lacked staining of the dermoepidermal junction with this antibody. To better define the sensitivity of binding by 19-DEJ-1 in junctional EB skin, 40 consecutive specimens representing the three major subtypes (Herlitz, 14; non-Herlitz, 15; and indeterminate, 11) were examined. No staining was noted along the dermoepidermal junction in any specimen, regardless of junctional EB subtype. Considering the recently discovered variability of binding by GB3 monoclonal antibody in some junctional EB subtypes, based on the present data it appears that the 19-DEJ-1 monoclonal antibody is the only immunohistochemical probe that can be used reliably for diagnosis of all major forms of junctional EB. Furthermore, these data suggest the possible utility of this particular antibody as a probe for identification, at the molecular level, of a basement membrane defect shared among all major forms of junctional EB.\r"

The latter is generally a sequela of deep vein thrombosis. Factors that enhance clot formation or impair fibrinolysis contribute to the pathogenesis of venous disease. It is already established that faulty fibrinolysis may play a pathogenic role in patients with venous disease. We examined the possibility that patients with venous disease have abnormally low plasma levels of proteins C and S, two proteins whose deficiencies have been reported to cause an increased frequency of thromboembolic disease. Using immunologic and functional assays for plasma proteins C and S, we found that 4 (21%) of 19 patients with lipodermatosclerosis and leg ulcers had abnormally low levels of protein C or protein S. One of 7 patients with lipodermatosclerosis without ulceration had a profoundly depressed level of protein C and a history of cerebral stroke at a young age. Plasma levels of protein C were normal in five patients with arterial insufficiency severe enough to cause leg ulceration. We conclude that abnormally low plasma levels of proteins C and S may be found in patients with lipodermatosclerosis and venous ulceration. As with the abnormally low fibrinolytic activity in these patients, our findings indicate a possible propensity for increased thrombotic disease.\r"

Her fever was unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, and on hospital day 53 she developed purpuric macules with necrotic centers on her left hand and forearm. Frozen sections of lesional skin were stained with Grocott's methenamine-silver and showed hyphae consistent with a species of Aspergillus; culture of the skin biopsy specimen yielded a pure culture of Aspergillus flavus. Localization of the emboli to the left upper extremity was subsequently explained by magnetic resonance imaging scan of the chest demonstrating invasion of the left subclavian artery by a pulmonary aspergilloma.\r"

  ".W": "In 1974 total colectomy and ileoanal straight endorectal pull-through (ERPT) were first used at our institution for the definitive management of total colonic Hirschsprung's disease in infants and children. Early success with this operation encouraged us to use this procedure in children and adults with ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis in 1977. Since 1974 we have performed total colectomy and straight ileoanal ERPT on 100 consecutive patients with ulcerative colitis (79), familial polyposis (19), and total colonic Hirschsprung's disease (10). Patients who have undergone a colectomy and ERPT but have not had their temporary ileostomy closed have been excluded from this report. This group of patients represents the only large series of straight ERPTs available for comparison with the various reservoir modifications that have been reported. All operations were performed under the direction of the author. The mean age at surgery was 20.6 +/- 9.8 years, with a range of 1 to 48 years. Forty-six patients were younger than 18 years at the time of operation. All patients with ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis underwent a temporary loop ileostomy with total abdominal colectomy with ERPT; the 10 infants and children with Hirschsprung's disease underwent the total colectomy and ERPT without a back-up ileostomy. There were two deaths in this series, one from fulminate hepatic failure in the late postoperative period and the other from multiple bowel fistulas and sepsis in a teenager with Crohn's disease, in whom the initial diagnosis was ulcerative colitis. Follow-up has ranged from 3 months to 15 years. There were 13 cases of adhesive bowel obstruction, seven of which required an enterolysis. Pelvic sepsis occurred in three patients, two of whom required operative drainage. Two women developed rectovaginal fistulas, which healed with temporary diversion. Minor wound infections occurred in five patients. There were no anastomotic leaks, nor were any cases of pouchitis encountered. In five patients permanent conversion to a Brooke ileostomy was required. Mean stool frequency 3 years after surgery was 7.7 per 24 hours. Daytime continence was achieved in all patients. Occasional nocturnal soiling occurred in 11.1% of patients at 1 year and was absent by 3 years. Neither age nor diagnosis (ulcerative colitis versus familial polyposis) affected stool frequency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To judge its performance, a 6-month study of 372 surgical ICU patients was performed. When patients were divided by mean duration of stay, mortality rates rose from 1% (short stay) to 19% (long stay) (p less than 0.001) for patients with APACHE II scores less than 10, but decreased from 94% (short stay) to 60% (long stay) (p less than 0.01) for patients with APACHE II scores more than 24. Exclusion of patients by high or low APACHE scores would 'save' 6% of ICU days but risk increasing morbidity, hospital costs, and deaths. Grouped APACHE II scores did not correlate with total hospital charges (r = 0.05, p = 0.89) or ICU days used (r = 0.42, p = 0.17). Grouping by APACHE II score and duration of ICU stay showed neither symmetry nor uniformity of mortality rates. Surgical patients would not be well served by APACHE II for quality assurance or cost containment.\r"

Segmental stenosis of the trachea is defined as involvement of less than one half the length of the airway, which affected six infants. Elongated stenosis involving more than one half the length of the trachea was seen in 12 infants, and complete annular cartilage rings, along the entire length of the trachea, were present in 11. Severe tracheomalacia occurred in six infants associated with aortic arch anomalies and in nine infants with esophageal atresia. Segmental tracheal resection was performed in 17 cases (two after failure of a rib cartilage graft), and anastomotic stricture developed in three. These three anastomotic strictures were resected, resulting in an excellent airway in two and restricture in one. Rib cartilage grafts were used in five patients: two of three with elongated stenosis with complete tracheal rings required subsequent resection, and one of two infants with tracheomalacia had excellent outcome. Approximately 50% of an infant's trachea can be resected, but rib cartilage grafts should be used for elongated stenosis. Resection of bronchial stenosis in two patients resulted in a widely patent bronchus. From this experience primary segmental tracheobronchial resection and re-resection of recurrent stenosis are highly successful. Anastomotic stricture is due to tension at the suture line and suture material inciting a fibrotic reaction. Rib cartilage grafts amounting to 25% or less of the circumference of the airway readily resurfaces with adjacent epithelium, but when 30% or more of the circumference is rib graft, epithelialization may be impaired.\r"

Although a policy of aggressive surgical resection of residual pulmonary and retroperitoneal disease following chemotherapy and normalization of serum tumor markers has been adopted for disseminated germ cell carcinoma, resection of residual hepatic disease in these cases has not been addressed. This report concerns a series of prospectively randomized patients who received systemic cisplatin-based chemotherapy for testis cancer during the past 13 years. Twenty-eight patients underwent resection of residual hepatic disease after serologic remission. Most (23 of 28 patients) of these procedures were performed concomitantly with other cytoreductive procedures. There were no operative deaths, although 28% of the patients developed complications. The 2-year survival rate was 54%, with an average follow-up of 34 months. Patients were stratified into three groups based on the most aggressive histology noted in the resected specimen. Survival is predicted by this histologic classification system. Hepatic resection can be performed safely and is an important component in the treatment of disseminated testicular carcinoma.\r"

Preoperative total plasma cholesterol (TC) was 363.3 +/- 136.8 mg/dL (mean +/- SD) in these patients. Baseline and follow-up TC results demonstrated highly significant (p less than or equal to 0.001) TC reduction, 34% (n = 48), 28% (n = 49), 35% (n = 26), 35% (n = 11), and 30% (n = 25) at 1, 2 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and more than 20 years, respectively, after PIB. In 21 patients with baseline, 1-year, and more than 20-year results TC decreased 33% by 1 year and remained 29% less than baseline more than 20 years after surgery (p = NS versus 1 year). Plasma triglyceride results were available in fewer patients, and no statistically significant changes developed after PIB. Two patients (3.5%) underwent PIB reversal, one for intractable diarrhea and one for recurrent nephrolithiasis. In the 25 nonreversed, long-term survivors, no statistically significant weight change was noted. Twenty-four per cent had 0 to 2, 52% had 3 to 5, and 24% had more than 5 bowel movements per day. Subsequent cholecystectomy was required in eight patients, and nephrolithiasis developed in 10 (40%). During 20 to 26 years, most survivors developed clinically apparent atherosclerosis: angina (60%), myocardial infarction (16%), or coronary artery bypass (28%). Coronary heart disease was the predominant cause of death among nonsurvivors (80%). Overall survival rates were 95% 88%, 75%, 59%, 53%, and 41% at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years, respectively, after PIB. Partial ileal bypass leads to highly significant TC reduction, which is sustained, essentially unchanged, more than 20 years after operation. In comparison to available epidemiologic and clinical trial data, these results support the hypothesis that TC reduction has a beneficial effect in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of duodenal ulcer increases with age, but acid secretion does not. We have investigated the effects of aging on a mechanism of duodenal mucosal defense. Basal and acid-stimulated bicarbonate secretions were measured in the proximal duodenum in anesthetized rats of three different age groups (3 months, 1 year, and 2 years). The proximal duodenum was cannulated in situ between two plastic tubes that extend downward from a titrating chamber, and bicarbonate secretion was measured by the method of Flemstrom et al. Although there was no significant difference in basal secretion among three groups, bicarbonate secretion in response to luminal acid (100 mmol/L [millimolar] HCl) was diminished in 1-year-old and 2-year-old rats (1-hour integrated bicarbonate secretions; 3 months = 5.8 +/- 0.7; 1 year = 3.1 +/- 1.0*; 2 years = 2.0 +/- 0.7*). We also studied the effects of two mediators for acid-stimulated duodenal bicarbonate secretion, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Intravenous infusion of VIP (0.4, 4, 40 nmol/kg/hr) and intraluminal administration of PGE2 (10(-5) mol/L [molar] and 10(-4) mol/L) induced duodenal bicarbonate secretion in a dose-dependent manner in all three groups, without significant difference between groups. These findings suggest that the release of mediator(s) in response to acid is decreased in the duodenum of the aging rats. The progressive breakdown in mucosal defense mechanisms with increasing age may explain, at least in part, the age-related increase of incidence of duodenal ulcer disease.\r"

Bench studies lasting for as long as 1 year have been performed. Heart replacement with the electric heart has been performed in 18 calves since 1984. The longest survivor lived for more than 7 months. Among the causes of termination were component failure, thromboembolic complications, and bleeding.

At the end of each protocol, the SMVs were acutely tested by connecting them to a mock-circulation device. The SMVs in group C developed stroke work at physiologic preloads superior to any previously reported, as high as 194% of left ventricular stroke work at afterloads of 80 mmHg. The SMVs in group B developed work outputs equivalent to 53% of the left ventricle, which is still more than four times that of the right ventricle.

Between 1965 and 1989, 79 transplants in 75 infants less than 2 years old were performed: 23 who were 12 months or younger, 52 who were older than 12 months; 63 donors were living related, 1 was living unrelated, and 15 were cadaver donors; 75 were primary transplants and 4 were retransplants. Infants were considered for transplantation when they were on, or about to begin, dialysis. All had intra-abdominal transplants with arterial anastomosis to the distal aorta. Sixty-four per cent are alive with functioning grafts. The most frequent etiologies of renal failure were hypoplasia (32%) and obstructive uropathy (20%); oxalosis was the etiology in 11%. Since 1983 patient survival has been 95% and 91% at 1 and 5 years; graft survival has been 86% and 73% at 1 and 5 years. For cyclosporine immunosuppressed patients, patient survival is 100% at 1 and 5 years; graft survival is 96% and 82% at 1 and 5 years. There was no difference in outcome between infants who were 12 months or younger versus those who were aged 12 to 24 months; similarly there was no difference between infants and older children. Sixteen (21%) patients died: 5 after operation from coagulopathy (1) and infection (4); and 11 late from postsplenectomy sepsis (4), recurrent oxalosis (3), infection (2), and other causes (2). Routine splenectomy is no longer done. There has not been a death from infection in patients transplanted since 1983. Rejection was the most common cause of graft loss (in 15 patients); other causes included death (with function) (7), recurrent oxalosis (3), and technical complications (3). Overall 52% of patients have not had a rejection episode; mean creatinine level in patients with functioning grafts is 0.8 +/- 0.2 mg/dL. Common postoperative problems include fever, atelectasis, and ileus. At the time of their transplants, the infants were small for age; but with a successful transplant, their growth, head circumference, and development have improved. Transplantation in infants requires an intensive multidisciplinary approach but yields excellent short- and long-term survival rates that are no different from those seen in older children or adults. Living donors should be used whenever possible. Patients with a successful transplantation experience improved growth and development, with excellent rehabilitation.\r"

  ".W": "The University of Chicago program in pediatric liver transplantation continues actively to seek innovative surgical solutions to problems related to the management of children with end-stage liver disease. Among the most important problems facing these children is a shortage of donor organs, which results from three factors in addition to the actual supply of pediatric donors: the concentration of pediatric liver disease in the population younger than 2 years; the necessity for a graft that is small enough; and the epidemiology of accidents and other events that lead to organ donation. Transplantation using a liver lobe as a graft overcomes size disparity and shifts the available supply of organs from older donors to younger recipients. This work describes the technical aspects of recent innovations in the use of liver lobes in pediatric transplantation, simple reduced-size liver transplantation (RLT), split-liver transplantation (SLT), orthotopic auxiliary liver grafting (ALT), and transplantation using a living related donor (LRLT), and compares their results. Since November 1986 a total of 61 procedures have been performed in which a liver lobe was used as a graft: 26 RLT; 30 SLT, 25 in children and 5 in adults; 5 LRLT; and 1 ALT. Overall 62% of transplants performed in children have involved using a liver lobe as a graft. The rates of complications are somewhat higher than with whole-liver transplantation, but this may not be entirely the result of the complex procedures. Split liver transplantation is associated with the highest mortality and complication rates. Living related liver transplantation has been associated with complications in donors and recipients, but to date survival is 100%. Orthotopic auxiliary liver transplantation effectively corrected the metabolic defect in one patient with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Overall the various modalities of using graft reduction have resulted in postoperative results similar to those achieved with full-size grafts, while pretransplantation mortality has been limited to less than 2%. Thus the use of grafts as liver lobes accomplishes the goal of reducing global mortality among children with end-stage liver disease, but at the cost of increased surgical complexity and more postoperative complications.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed trends in clinical, angiographic, and operative variables and documented long-term survival in 2509 consecutive patients who underwent reoperation for myocardial revascularization at The Cleveland Clinic during a 20-year period (1967 to 1987). The patients were grouped into four cohorts by year of surgery. This analysis showed that vein graft atherosclerosis has become the leading indication for reoperation, and patient age and interval between operations continue to increase. Mortality rates ranged from 2% to 5% and, despite increasing comorbidity, more extensive coronary atherosclerosis, and worse left ventricular function, the hospital mortality rate was 2.9% from 1985 to 1987. Perioperative new Q-wave myocardial infarction occurred in 7% to 8% of patients from 1967 to 1984 but decreased to 4% in the 1985 to 1987 period (p = 0.04). Internal thoracic artery graft usage in reoperations increased from 27% in the 1967 to 1978 period to 67% in the 1985 to 1987 period. Advanced age and presence of left main coronary artery disease adversely influenced late survival more consistently than other factors. Patients operated on in 1967 to 1978 had fewer risk factors, which explains their higher survival rate compared with more recent cohorts. Factors associated with improved 10-year actuarial survival included age younger than 65 years, mild angina, no major comorbidity, no left main coronary artery disease, good left ventricular performance, and an internal thoracic artery graft.\r"

We prospectively evaluated 190 adult inpatients with either acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (129) or lymphadenopathy acquired immunodeficiency-related complex (61); 151 (80%) were parenteral drug abusers, and 172 patients (91%) had neurologic symptoms or signs. There was no significant difference in prevalence of neurologic disease between parenteral drug abusers and non-parenteral drug abusers, or between patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and those with lymphadenopathy acquired immunodeficiency-related complex. The prevalence of neurologic symptoms in these patients with lymphadenopathy acquired immunodeficiency-related complex and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is the highest reported to date and appears to reflect the prospective nature of the study.\r"

We therefore studied the neurologic status of 11 patients who had low cobalamin levels without definite hematologic evidence of deficiency. Neurologic evaluation included pattern-shift visual and median and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials. None of the patients had megaloblastic changes in the blood or bone marrow, although 7 of the 11 had subtle cellular cobalamin disturbances demonstrated by an abnormal deoxyuridine suppression test result. Seven patients had normal Schilling test results and 2 had borderline results; however, 2 of the 5 patients tested further had food-cobalamin malabsorption, while a third had prepernicious anemia. The patients displayed a variety of neurologic problems, including dementia, depression, myelopathy, neuropathy, and seizure disorder; 1 patient was neurologically normal by clinical criteria. Evoked potential abnormalities were demonstrable in 8 of the 9 patients with subtle cobalamin deficiency, and in at least 5 cases the disturbance was central. In contrast, both patients whose low serum cobalamin levels were found on evaluation to be spurious had normal evoked potentials. Evoked potential abnormalities improved in the one patient retested after cobalamin therapy. These findings demonstrate that neurologic deficits occur not only in classic cobalamin deficiency but also in subtle or atypical cobalamin deficiency states in which anemia is absent and Schilling test results are normal. Electrophysiologic evidence of neurologic impairment is often present, even in patients without obvious clinical neurologic abnormalities.\r"

We studied four families with the latter disease in which some members developed a progressive myopathy. Episodes of paralysis were prolonged, lasting for months in some cases, and in one case paralysis was sufficiently severe to require ventilatory support. The progressive myopathy tended to develop at a time when attacks of paralysis were decreasing in frequency. Muscle biopsy specimens showed variability in fiber size, internal nuclei, and fibers with vacuoles. Electron microscopy showed myofibrillary degeneration and tubular aggregates. An abnormal biopsy specimen was more common in older patients. Our experience suggests that a progressive myopathy is as common in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis as it is in the hypokalemic disorder.\r"

Downward trends in age-adjusted incidence rates and upward trends in age at onset were seen for Chamorros of both sexes. Since 1980, new cases have occurred only among persons over 50 years of age, whereas a younger age at onset had been noted in the past. Evidence suggests that the length of the latent period varied widely (up to decades) and increased with time, the risk of acquiring parkinsonism-dementia complex had declined since the late 1950s, and the critical age of exposure to an unknown factor in the environment on Guam appears to have been during adolescence or adulthood.\r"

Two patients had no consistent improvement in memory, and agitation, depression, paranoia, and seizures developed during treatment.

The diagnosis was based on the presence of oligoclonal varicella-specific IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid and angiographic findings. Clinical and angiographic follow-up, and serial thymidine kinase activity levels in the cerebrospinal fluid suggested a self-limiting course of the virus-induced vasculopathy.

Seven of these patients also had severe occlusive disease of the contralateral internal carotid artery. The clinical and radiologic features, in combination with studies of cerebral blood flow, were consistent with hemodynamically mediated cerebral ischemia. Occlusive internal carotid artery disease may be more commonly associated with hemodynamic cerebral ischemia than previously believed, and small cerebral infarcts in the deep arterial border zone areas are likely to be an important manifestation of this process.\r"

Three members came to autopsy, and neuropathologically, the major changes included varying degrees of atrophy of the basis pontis and degeneration of the spinocerebellar tracts, Clarke's columns, anterior horn neurons, and fasciculus gracilis. The dentate nucleus was spared, and there was slight neuron loss from the substantia nigra in one patient. Clinically and neuropathologically, our family resembles that reported by Boller and Segarra as having spinopontine atrophy. However, several kindreds with similar findings have recently been described as having Azorean or Machado-Joseph disease in non-Portuguese families. Comparison of clinical and neuropathological features in spinopontine atrophy and Machado-Joseph disease, both in Portuguese and non-Portuguese families, reveals clinical and pathological similarities and differences between the two. The major differences in our patients include only minor extraocular movement abnormality and absence of protuberant eyes, and muscular rigidity clinically, and the sparing of the substantia nigra and the dentate nucleus neuropathologically. These differences suggest that spinopontine atrophy, as manifested in our family, is distinct from Machado-Joseph disease. Our family showed no linkage to the HLA locus on chromosome 6.\r"

All subjects with DS had a trisomy 21 karyotype, and 3 of the 6 older subjects were demented as judged from a history of mental deterioration, disorientation, and memory loss. In healthy normal subjects, there was a significant correlation between age and CSF choline concentrations. Compared with age-matched controls, in young subjects with DS, CSF, but not plasma, choline concentrations were elevated (by 49%), whereas in older subjects with DS, CSF and plasma choline concentrations were similar to control values. The CSF choline concentrations were unrelated to body height in the DS and control groups, and rostrocaudal CSF choline gradients did not differ between either the control and DS groups or the young and old subjects with DS, suggesting that the elevation in the CSF choline concentration in young subjects with DS was not related to their shorter stature. Since increased CSF choline concentrations in young adult subjects with DS were accompanied by normal plasma choline concentrations, these results suggest that young adults with DS have either an increased release of choline from the brain or a reduced rate of clearance of choline from CSF.\r"

The flow distribution in Rett syndrome is very similar to the distribution of brain metabolic activity in infants of a few months of age. The abnormal regional cerebral blood flow distribution most likely reflects the widespread functional disturbances in the brain of patients with Rett syndrome, whereas computed tomographic and neuropathologic examination only reveal slight changes when compared with normal children.\r"

The PSVEPs and BAEPs were within normal limits in all patients, excluding abnormalities attributable to other disease, but the group P100 latency was significantly prolonged in the group with MND. The BAEPs were normal in the group with MND. This study provides neurophysiological evidence of sensory system involvement in MND.\r"

  ".W": "We used standardized neuropsychological measures of intellectual, cognitive, psychomotor, and emotional functioning to compare 39 patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy and 25 normal controls of similar age. The patients reflected greater depression, anxiety, and subjective emotional discomfort than did the control subjects. While 4 of the patients had below-normal IQ scores (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [WAIS-R] Full-Scale IQ [FSIQ] less than 80), their clinical histories suggested lifelong functioning at such levels. As a group, the patients were not abnormal in general intellectual functioning and related cognitive abilities (WAIS-R FSIQ, mean [+/- SD], 93.46 +/- 13.19; Wechsler Memory Scale mental quotient, 108.95 +/- 17.43). These scores were lower than those of the normal controls (WAIS-R FSIQ, 113.72 +/- 12.68; mental quotient, 127.80 +/- 12.40); however, the controls were a highly educated group with intelligence levels that were higher than those of the average population. Moreover, when education and motor dysfunction were statistically covaried, no significant differences between the patients and the normal controls were apparent on the cognitive and intellectual tasks. Further analysis of specific memory performance in a subgroup of patients and controls matched for age, sex, and education yielded findings that were comparable with the overall group analysis. We conclude that motor dysfunction and depressed mood could leave patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy appearing to be impaired in memory, even demented, when they are not.\r"

Thirteen of the 16 inoculated macaques seroconverted 2-6 weeks after infection. Three M. mulatta remained seronegative. The seroconverted animals developed antibody titres from 80 to 40,000. Their antibodies reacted with gp160 and gp130 and, in varying degrees, with gp32 and core proteins. Virus could be re-isolated from 11 of the 16 macaques. M. mulatta were transiently viraemic 6-14 weeks after infection whereas all M. fascicularis were persistently viraemic 2-7 weeks after infection onwards. In the 6-18 months after infection one M. mulatta lost 20% of its body weight and two M. fascicularis showed transient lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly; the other animals remained clinically normal. A re-isolated virus from a M. mulatta was indistinguishable from the inoculated HIV-2ben by genomic restriction enzyme analysis. M. mulatta and M. fascicularis are infectable by a single intravenous injection of cell-free HIV-2ben. Persistent viraemia in M. fascicularis represents a valuable and reliable parameter for studies on antivirals and vaccines.\r"

Among 138 animals tested, 57 and 33% were infected with SIVsmm and STLV-I, respectively. While the proportion of female mangabeys (66%) differed significantly (P less than 0.01) from the proportion of male mangabeys (42%) infected with SIVsmm, the proportions of males and females infected with STLV-I were similar, suggesting independent transmission of the two viruses. Among mangabeys less than 1 year old, none were infected with STLV-I and only five of 27 mangabeys, all of which were at least 6 months old when first tested, were infected with SIVsmm. The data document that natural infection of sooty mangabey monkeys with SIVsmm or in association with STLV-I infection does not result in increased disease or mortality, and that transmission of both SIVsmm and STLV-I appears to occur primarily through sexual activity.\r"

The plasma membrane Fc receptor (FcR) on mononuclear phagocytes plays a major role in the binding of murine immunoglobulin G2 alpha anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (MAb), and contributes to binding of other subclasses. The FcR detected shows an increase in apparent molecular weight from 60 to 70 kD over 2 weeks in culture. U937 cells resemble T lymphocytes, rather than primary monocytes/macrophages, in expressing relatively high levels of CD4; FcR contributes little to the signal. The potential bivalent interactions between immunoglobulin G and receptors such as CD4 and FcR could influence the binding and fate of HIV in primary monocytes/macrophages.\r"

Demographic variables (age, sex, years of education, and social class) were recorded as additional indices of premorbid functioning. Cross-sectional comparison of NART and WAIS-R scores showed that cognitive function was not more impaired with increasing severity of HIV illness, as defined by clinical staging. Nor were HIV-positive patients more impaired than a control group of seronegative drug users. Mean NART scores did not differ significantly from that predicted by a regression model, indicating that the NART can be reliably used to estimate premorbid intelligence for this population. However, current performance on WAIS-R subtests was below that expected from population models of cognitive function that combine measures of premorbid IQ and demographic factors, providing evidence of impaired intellectual function. Currently observed cognitive deficits are probably more due to drug use than to the insidious onset of AIDS dementia complex.\r"

IVDUs starting methadone maintenance in 1987-1989 had a seroprevalence rate of 22%. In 1989 the percentage of IVDUs exchanging syringes and needles fell to only 5% of seropositive addicts. Only one seroconversion was observed in 1094 patient-months of observation in 1988-1989, which was probably due to sexual contact. The evidence suggests that, in the IDVUs studied, transmission of HIV has diminished since the early 1980s.\r"

Current evidence is insufficient even to estimate the attributable risk associated with breast-feeding. There is a possibility that the policy promoted in industrialized societies will eventually become established in urban and peri-urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa. This may be defensible for some elite urban mothers providing safe artificial feeding. However, calculations of the consequence of any population-level change to bottle-feeding indicate that it would result in more deaths from infectious causes, substantially adding to the child deaths directly attributable to HIV-1 infection. These data demonstrate that there is a clear need for policy-makers and health care workers to undertake further promotion of breast-feeding despite the AIDS epidemic.\r"

This paper presents the results of samples from six developing country capitals and Martinique. The estimated impact of HIV-1 infection on overall infant mortality is low in regions where maternal HIV-1 seroprevalence is low and overall infant mortality is high, but substantial in locations where either maternal HIV-1 seroprevalence is high, or where maternal HIV-1 seroprevalence is moderate and overall infant mortality is low. The estimates for child (ages 1-4 years) and under-5 mortality suggest that the impact of HIV-1 infection on overall mortality in children may exceed the impact on infant mortality. The recent gains made in ensuring child survival are likely to be increasingly reversed in regions where HIV-1 infection is being transmitted in a substantial proportion of pregnancies and births.\r"

We observed an increase in the use of condoms in the years 1985-1988, which was reflected by 34.4% of the 19-year-olds having used a condom at their first intercourse, compared with 43.3 and 47.5% among the 18- and 17-year-olds, respectively. A logistic model showed that non-use of contraception was particularly associated with a low age at first experience of intercourse and consumption of alcohol immediately beforehand, while an increase in age at first intercourse and not having consumed alcohol before that occasion increased the likelihood of condom use.\r"

Thirty HIV-infected patients with lymphadenopathy, fever and/or weight loss were evaluated with Ga-67. Lymph-node biopsy and/or needle aspirations were done in all patients. Twelve of 17 patients with grade 2 or 3 Ga-67 (uptake equal to or greater than that in the liver) had mycobacteriosis, three had lymphoma, one had Kaposi's sarcoma plus Castleman's disease and one had follicular hyperplasia. The three patients with grade 1 Ga-67 (uptake greater than that in soft tissue but less than that in the liver) had follicular hyperplasia. Of the 10 patients with grade 0 Ga-67 (less than or equal to that in soft tissue), nine had follicular hyperplasia and one had Kaposi's sarcoma. Sixteen of 17 patients with grade 2 or 3 Ga-67 versus one of 13 with Ga-67 grade 1 or 0 had diseases other than follicular hyperplasia (P less than 0.0001). Ga-67 may be a practical diagnostic tool in HIV-infected patients with lymphadenopathy and constitutional symptoms. A grade 1 or 0 Ga-67 suggests the presence of follicular hyperplasia, and lymph-node biopsy may be avoided unless Kaposi's sarcoma is suspected.\r"

In 26 patients no cause for the diarrhoea was found. In 17 patients the cause of diarrhoea was microbiological, and in 19 rectal histology provided a specific diagnosis. In all these patients sigmoidoscopic appearances were abnormal except in those with Cryptosporidium alone. Colonoscopy provided additional information in only one individual, with cytomegalovirus ulcers of the transverse colon. DCBE was abnormal in only seven cases (cytomegalovirus in three, Kaposi's sarcoma in two, Giardia lamblia in two) and in no case provided additional information. A combination of stool microbiology and rectal histology gave a sensitivity of 97% with a positive predictive value of 100%. The sensitivities of DCBE and colonoscopy with histology were low (16 and 62%, respectively) although the specificity for each test was high, with high positive predictive values.

Various disconnection signs were also present. His CT and MRI scans disclosed major lesions situated in the posterior half of the genu and the whole trunk of the corpus callosum, as well as in the left medial frontal and temporo-occipital lobes. Left hemispatial neglect was invariably demonstrated in right-hand performance such as copying drawings, line bisection, matching identical figures and copying multiple digit numbers, and in verbal performance such as confrontation naming and reading aloud multiple digit numbers. In contrast, little or no right hemispatial neglect was demonstrated in tasks performed with the left hand. These findings support the hypothesis that the left hemisphere is only concerned with attending to the contralateral hemispace and that the right hemisphere is specialized for attending to both sides of space although the preponderant tendency is for attending to the contralateral hemispace. The neglect symptoms observed in our patient may be a disconnection sign which was attributable to a combination of lesions in the corpus callosum and in the left medial frontal lobe.\r"

Motor nerves including those of the oculomotor systems were severely affected, but involvement of the sensory system was even more marked. Minor hypertrophic changes were present in the distal portions of the peripheral nerve trunks, but there was no appreciable difference in the density of myelinated nerve fibres between proximal and distal levels. Morphometric data including teased fibre analyses and g ratio scattergrams suggest that the underlying pathogenetic mechanism is that of a neuronopathy. Unmyelinated axons were also severely depleted. Review of the previous literature revealed that the pathological changes of the PNS in group A xeroderma pigmentosum are thought to be slowly progressive, which is also suggested by the severe and widespread sclerotic changes of the CNS in the present 2 cases.\r"

Neuropsychological investigation performed about 8 yrs after the operation revealed a dissociation between very poor performance on recognition tests (on which the patient's performance was as poor as that in classical amnesic patients) and normal performance (estimated by the number of correct responses) in recall. This pattern has not previously been reported and is the reverse of that observed both in normal subjects and in amnesic patients. In addition, the patient was able to achieve a number of difficult learning tasks, at times normally; the relearning of one of these tasks after a delay of 1 h was perfectly normal. The recognition failure is interpreted in terms of the suggestion that memory performance results from an interaction between knowledge and subjective experience of remembering.\r"

  ".W": "Ballistic wrist extensor movements were interrupted by a sudden perturbing force in two conditions, and subjects were asked either to compensate for ('oppose') the perturbation or to cease the extensor movement ('let-go') when the interruption occurred. In the first condition, the interruption occurred unexpectedly in some of the trials, whereas in the second it occurred on every trial. Responses were recorded from the flexor and extensor carpi radialis muscles, and from the scalp and cervical spine. Unexpected perturbing forces were associated with an early extensor EMG response (M1) and longer latency EMG responses in both flexor and extensor muscles. When the interruptions occurred in every trial, both the late EMG activity and the cerebral responses were markedly attenuated. The relation between expectation of perturbation and the occurrence or size of the late EMG activity indicates that this response is under supraspinal control. The potentials recorded over the cervical spine and scalp were, like the late EMG activity, influenced by the expectancy of interruption. These potentials persisted even when the potentials related to the mechanically elicited SEP were removed by subtraction of responses to anticipated interruptions from those to unanticipated interruptions. The earliest of these potentials preceded the late EMG activity by 30-50 ms. They were present when the late responses were present, absent when the late responses were absent, and became progressively smaller when the late responses became smaller, suggesting a tight coupling between these events and the late EMG events. These results indicate that cerebral activity, unrelated merely to mechanical stimulation, consistently precedes the late EMG activity, and thereby directly suggests that the long-latency response has a cerebral (possible cortical) pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Human medial temporal lobe neuronal activity and event-related potentials were recorded during the following behaviours: contextual recognition of words and faces, semantic discrimination of nonwords from words, and discrimination of stimulus classes based on perceptual attributes. Three distinct classes of behavioural correlates of unit activity were demonstrated by visual inspection of peristimulus histograms and by nonparametric statistics: (1) neuronal excitation during a keypress related to the subject's choice; (2) specific and nonspecific excitation to words; (3) excitation or inhibition to rare stimuli in a sensory discrimination task. Responses specifically to familiar (as opposed to unfamiliar) words or faces, or to tasks requiring recent memory per se were never seen. Keypress excitation was relatively common (32/76 units) and occurred regardless of whether the keypress target was a repeated or nonrepeated word, or the task required recent or remote semantic memory. In a more complex recognition task utilizing two responses and an imperative cue for the patient's response, units with prior keypress excitation failed to generate the response. This suggests that keypress excitation is not strictly tied either to response choice or to generation. The onset latencies and temporal relationship to event-related potentials of the nonspecific and specific excitation to words and the excitation to rare stimuli suggest that they represent contextual encoding of stimuli. Similar evidence suggests that the inhibition to rare stimuli represents inhibitory processes terminating contextual encoding. Thus human medial temporal lobe neurons seem to contribute information during successive stages of a cognitive stimulus-response task: contextual encoding, closure and response-selection.\r"

A detailed follow-up study of these patients using standardized psychiatric assessments failed to confirm a number of recent claims about poststroke depressive disorders. We found no evidence that left-sided lesions were associated with more severe or persistent depressive symptoms, or that right-sided lesions were associated with hypomania. The DSM III syndrome of major depression was much less common than has previously been reported, and was not specifically associated with lesions placed anteriorly in the left hemisphere. There was a weak correlation between mood symptom scores and the proximity of the stroke lesion to the frontal pole of the hemisphere, but no evidence of a difference between right and left hemisphere strokes in the nature of the relationship between lesion distribution and mood symptoms. We suggest that previous studies have different findings because of differences in the conventions applied to the definition and measurement of psychiatric disorders after stroke, and because other studies have concentrated on selected inpatient populations.\r"

Her ability to remember unfamiliar faces is severely impaired in comparison with controls, as is her ability to identify the faces of celebrities who have become famous since the time of her illness in 1985. By contrast, she performs well on tests of recognition memory for words and has no problem in identifying celebrities from their names. She is also good at identifying faces of people who became famous before her illness. On tests of episodic memory, she continues to perform well at remembering familiar faces and objects, regardless of whether the test demands memory for which face/object was presented or memory for which view of a face/object was presented. Her poor memory for visual material is confined to unfamiliar faces and objects. Consequently, it is evident that she can learn new visual information so long as it relates to a familiar visual form; it is the learning of new visual forms that is impaired. A final experiment revealed that she is also poor at remembering unfamiliar voices. This raises the possibility that the basic deficit affects recent nonverbal memory and is not confined to the visual modality. Overall, the findings have important implications for the nature of recent visual memory loss, and for the way in which visual information is stored in memory.\r"

  ".W": "When making discrete aiming movements, patients with Parkinson's disease show greater inherent variability in the endpoints of their movements than do normal subjects. Endpoint variability can be reduced, by moving more slowly, by utilizing visual guidance, and by making small amplitude movements. The greater variability of patients is not a universal finding, but depends on the conditions of movement. For small movements the performance of patients equates to that of controls. For larger movements the results indicate that if sufficient time is available, patients can use visual guidance (if available) to reduce the variability of their movements to the level of normals. Patients can generate fast and/or large amplitude arm movements if required, but they are erratic if made in the dark or over a short duration. Their difficulty lies not so much in the magnitude of muscle force available to them, but rather in an inability to produce it consistently for any given movement attempted. Bradykinesia may in part result from this inherent variability in that parkinsonian patients, in order to maintain accuracy within acceptable limits, are forced to increase the duration of their movements to a level where they can make use of visual guidance. In any event, theoretical explanations for the movement disorder in Parkinson's disease advanced in the literature need to take some account of this increased variability of movement.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of peripheral, data-driven effects is contrasted with conceptual, 'top-down' effects to the reading performance of 2 subjects with neglect dyslexia following a single right hemisphere lesion. Several tasks were administered, manipulating the physical, lexical or morphemic properties of the stimuli in an attempt to establish whether the attentional deficit disrupts reading at an early or late stage of processing. Both subjects were impaired at detecting elementary stimulus features on the left side of the display but were even more impaired at identifying conjoined features. One subject's performance was influenced by structural manipulations which altered the low-level representation of the stimulus. The other was less affected by structural changes of the stimuli but was influenced by the lexical and morphemic status of the words. This apparent double dissociation is interpreted as arising from a graded attentional deficit at a single locus, early in the reading process where low-level information is detected. When the deficit is not severe sufficient information may be picked up and may interact with higher order lexical knowledge to offset partially the peripheral malfunction. For a severe attentional deficit, top-down knowledge is not engaged as insufficient information is processed on the left-hand side. This hybrid view of attention provides insight into the mechanisms underlying neglect dyslexia and bears on the role of attention in normal visual processing.\r"

On the pitch dimension, right brain-damaged patients, in contrast to left brain-damaged patients and normal controls, were found to be little affected by the availability of contour as a discrimination cue. However, both brain-damaged groups were impaired on tasks requiring consideration of pitch interval structure. These findings are consistent with hierarchical contribution of the cerebral hemispheres, with the right hemisphere being primary in representing the melody in terms of its global contour and the left hemisphere by filling in the intervallic structure. On the temporal dimension, only the discrimination of durational values (the rhythm) was found to be impaired by a lesion in either hemisphere, which spared, however, the metric interpretation of the musical sequences. These latter results are discussed in the light of current models of temporal processing. Finally, evidence of double dissociation between the processing of the pitch dimension and the processing of rhythm was obtained, providing further support for the need to fractionate musical perceptual abilities in order to arrive at a theory as to how the two hemispheres cohere to produce a musical interpretation of the auditory input.\r"

To ascertain their relative frequency and significance, we studied prospectively 74 consecutive patients with late Lyme disease, with and without PNS symptoms: 53% had intermittent limb paraesthesiae, 25% the carpal tunnel syndrome, 8% painful radiculopathy, and 3% Bell's palsy; 39% had disseminated neurophysiological abnormalities. To assess the interrelationships among these syndromes, we reviewed the neurophysiological findings in all 163 such patients that we have studied to date. Reversible abnormalities of distal conduction were the most common finding. Demyelinating neuropathy was extremely rare. The pattern of abnormality was similar in all patient groups, regardless of whether the symptoms suggested radiculopathy, Bell's palsy, or neuropathy. We conclude that (1) reversible PNS abnormalities occur in one-third of our patients with late Lyme borreliosis, and (2) the pattern of electrophysiological abnormalities is the same in all and is indicative of widespread axonal damage, suggesting that these different presentations reflect varying manifestations of the same pathological process.\r"

This inhibition of the RIII reflex is not seen in tetraplegic patients with clinically complete spinal cord transection, suggesting that supraspinal structures are involved in this type of inhibition, mediated through 'Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls' (DNIC). In the present study, the effects of heterotopic nociceptive stimuli on the RIII reflex were examined in 3 patients with unilateral thalamic vascular lesions and in 3 with Wallenberg's syndrome (WS). In the former, as in normal subjects, nociceptive electrical conditioning stimuli applied to the analgesic hand produced a profound inhibition of the RIII reflex followed by long-lasting after-effects. No inhibition was observed in the WS patients. The same conditioning procedure applied to the nonanalgesic hand of the WS patients resulted in inhibition and after-effects similar to those observed in normal subjects. The fact that noxious but nonpainful stimuli triggered DNIC in the patients with thalamic lesions excludes the possibility that masking of pain by a second painful focus is mainly due to attentional processes. It is also concluded that lemniscal and spinothalamic pathways are not involved in the triggering of DNIC in man and it is suggested that the brainstem and probably the spinoreticular tract are key neuronal links in the loop subserving DNIC in man.\r"

Because proprioception and autonomic function were preserved, and ataxia only slowly worsened, this proved to be a benign syndrome. The pattern of sensory loss indicated a 'length-dependent' neuropathy. Evaluation of sural nerve biopsy revealed a marked loss of axons, especially of those with diameters 1-7 microns and 0.2-1.5 microns. It therefore seemed likely that impairment of pain and temperature in the syndrome resulted from a loss of primary sensory afferents. It is concluded that this family represents a previously unrecognized variant and that the spectrum of hereditary ataxias needs to be widened to include an associated severe but selective loss of pain and temperature sensation.\r"

Electrophysiological and morphological investigations were made on nerve, muscle and the neuromuscular junction of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL). It was found that the absence of sensory innervation had no effect on the development of muscle bulk, on the fibre diameters or on histochemical profiles. The elimination of polyneuronal innervation proceeded at the normal rate and was complete by 3 wks of age. The strength of contractile responses and the number of motor units were normal in both muscles. End-plate areas were measured and the size distribution found to be normal in soleus. In EDL, however, there was a preponderance of small end-plates and a relative deficiency of large ones. This was associated with an abnormally low frequency of miniature end-plate potentials and of the mean quantal content of transmission. There was also a reduction in the complexity of the postsynaptic specialization at end-plates in the EDL. Localized axonal swellings packed with neurofilaments were observed in preterminal motor nerve fibres, which suggested an abnormality of axonal transport. There was no evidence of denervation of muscle fibres. The contractile characteristics of soleus and EDL were still distinguishable as slow and fast-twitch, respectively, despite the abnormalities found, and it seems likely that impulse traffic in the lower motoneuron is only marginally affected, if at all. An abnormality of axonal transport may be responsible for the inability of motoneurons to maintain large end-plates in fast-twitch muscles.\r"

  ".U": "90374118\r", 
  ".W": "While the pure sensation of cold is evoked by activation of a specific set of afferent channels, an additional set is believed to be activated by noxious low-temperature stimuli evoking cold pain. At primary afferent level, the channels concerned with the cold fraction of cold pain are served by myelinated A delta cold-specific fibres, whereas those concerned with the pain fraction are served by unmyelinated C nociceptors. In the present study, interaction between the two types of afferent input underlying cold pain was investigated by selectively blocking conduction in myelinated fibres. When doing so to the point of abolishing cold sensation, ramps of low-temperature stimuli eventually evoked a first sensation of burning pain. In addition to, and contemporaneous with, this change in quality, a significant decrease in pain threshold (reduction in required stimulus energy) was recorded when applying a noxious low-temperature stimulus. Such exaggeration in magnitude of low temperature-induced pain and the unmasking of its burning quality by A fibre block imply release of central sensory transmission due to removal of inhibitory primary afferent input. Myelinated fibres transmitting either tactile, cold sensations or both could exert this inhibition. Previous evidence of suppression of pain by low-temperature stimuli indicates that it is the cold-specific input that normally exerts this central gating on nociceptor input. The present results may also offer an explanation for the occurrence of a syndrome of burning pain on cold exposure in neuropathic patients with impaired ability to perceive cold.\r"

These cases were from different foci of type I FAP in Japan, but showed a similar pathology in the peripheral nerves. Loss of dorsal root and sympathetic ganglion neurons, predominantly those of small size, was prominent, whereas ventral horn cells were well preserved. Distally accentuated axonal loss with marked axonal sprouting was the principal feature. Fibre sprouts were ubiquitous throughout the nerves and affected the fibre size distribution. Segmental demyelination and remyelination were prominent in the proximal portions of nerves, but axonal degeneration was more conspicuous in the distal portions. The centrally-directed branches of the primary sensory neurons did not show distally-accentuated axonal loss in the dorsal columns. Amyloid deposits were present universally in the endoneurial spaces of the peripheral nerves, but more prominently in the dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic ganglia and more proximal portions of the nerves, and the distribution correlated well with the occurrence of the pathology of peripheral nerves. Neurofilamentous accumulation was frequent in the proximal axons and neuronal cell bodies of the sensory and sympathetic neurons. Schwann cells and satellite cells to which amyloid deposits were attached frequently showed disappearance of basement membrane and proliferation of distorted processes. The findings in the present cases suggest that the Schwann and satellite cells may be directly affected by the amyloid deposits, but the pathogenetic mechanism of marked axonal and neuronal involvement still remains to be elucidated.\r"

In all patients, pursuit gains decreased in parallel with the direction of the impairment of slow-phase OKN velocity with a significant left/right difference. Decreases of gains were predominantly towards the affected side in 22 patients, whereas they were predominantly towards the contralateral side in 2 patients with dorsal tegmental pontine lesions and in 4 out of 8 patients with Wallenberg's syndrome. The relationship of pursuit gains to percentage reduction of fixation-suppression of caloric nystagmus (%FS) showed no correlation. The following four groups were classified. In group A, which was the largest, pursuit gains and %FS decreased predominantly towards the lesioned side. This group consisted of 5 patients with lesions in the midbrain, 6 patients with lesions in the ventral pons and 4 out of 8 patients with Wallenberg's syndrome. The opposite of group A was group D, showing reverse electro-oculographic (EOG) patterns to those in group A in relation to the lesioned side. Group D consisted of 2 patients with lesions in the dorsal pontine tegmentum. This observation, taken together with the decreases of pursuit and OKN gains in relation to the lesioned side, might indicate that lesions of ascending fibres are responsible for pursuit and OKN abnormalities. Group B, consisting of 7 patients with lesions either in the superior or middle cerebellar peduncles, showed decreased pursuit gains predominantly towards the lesioned side and %FS reduced predominantly towards the side contralateral to the lesion. EOGs of these patients were consistent with the results of floccular ablation in the monkey. In group C, these two parameters showed patterns opposite to those in group B in relation to the lesioned side and this group consisted of the other 4 patients with Wallenberg's syndrome. In patients of this group, the inferior cerebellar peduncle might be involved. The combined use of these tests is thus useful for lateralizing the lesion in the brainstem.\r"

  ".W": "Cortical glucose utilization was measured under light anaesthesia using positron emission tomography and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose before and serially after stereotaxic anterior corpus callosum section in 3 adult baboons (Papio papio); in 1 animal needles were introduced but callosotomy was not performed ('sham' operation). Lesion efficacy was verified by x-ray computerized tomography and by postmortem examination which indicated effective anterior two-thirds callosal section in all 3 baboons, as well as a small contusional area in the medial frontal cortex. A two-way layout analysis of variance performed on the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlc) data obtained in the frontotemporal, temporal and occipital areas revealed significant effects for both the time and the region factors (P less than 0.00001 for each); the time effects indicated a significant initial metabolic depression (P less than 0.01) at day 11 and 18, and a subsequent recovery (P less than 0.01 to 0.05) at day 98. Average CMRGlc changes from preoperative values at successive studies were -23%, -27%, -17%, -8% and +2%, and -17%, -21%, -10%, -5% and +6% in the 'surgically approached' and the contralateral frontotemporal area, respectively. The frontotemporal/occipital CMRGlc ratio was significantly depressed at days 11, 18 and 32 (P less than 0.01, 0.01 and 0.05, respectively), indicating a transient postoperative alteration in the cortical metabolic pattern. In the 'sham' animal, surgery induced negligible metabolic effects. Our results indicate that effective anterior corpus callosum section induces a transient bilateral depression of cortical metabolism, which predominates in the anterior parts of the brain, while metabolic recovery suggests efficient neuronal adaptation. These functional effects in the cortex may underlie the transient behavioural changes that follow anterior callosotomy in man.\r"

Within 10 days of the destruction of all endogenous oligodendrocytes and demyelination of all axons in the lesion, a new population of small glial cells appeared coincident with division of the residual astrocytes and developed a process-bearing axon-embracing morphology. The processes of these small glial cells (SGCs) contained intermediate filaments composed not of glial fibrillary acidic protein but of vimentin and over the ensuing 14 days these cells confirmed their oligodendrocyte destiny by differentiating to lose the intermediate filaments, form myelin and acquire the acquire the typical oligodendrocyte antigenic phenotype. It is suggested that the extensive remyelination of this lesion is sponsored by the new population of SGCs which in turn are generated either by dedifferentiated reactive astrocytes or by as yet unidentified precursor cells.\r"

A comparison of the results of all visual measures suggested a nonuniform loss of function in the patient group without ON and a more consistent loss of function in the group with ON. The various measures were equally efficient in detecting abnormal function, albeit from different areas of the central visual field. Clinical disease duration was not a significant independent factor in predicting visual dysfunction. In contrast, a comparison of clinical classification categories revealed significantly fewer abnormalities of visual function in the suspected MS category (31%) than in the ON, early probably and clinically definite categories (75-100%), a result which indicated the importance of clinical classification as a predictor of visual dysfunction.\r"

The nature of this disturbance, and the fate of memories related to faces, were investigated in a long-standing prosopagnosic woman (P.V.). An examination of P.V.'s perceptual capacities indicated no major impairment at matching faces, including different views of the same faces, and multidimensional scaling analysis showed that she could achieve configurational representations of faces as do normal subjects. In spite of her inability to evoke memories of known persons from their faces, P.V. displayed clear evidence that she could use pertinent memories related to these faces in tasks that did not explicitly call for their evocation. This covert recognition of faces was observed in perceptual learning and cued-recognized faces, attempts were made at surmounting the blocked activation of pertinent memories. Some of these attempts were successful in inducing P.V. into experiencing a sense of familiarity with the faces and identifying them, and this was the first occurrence of overt face recognition by P.V. since the onset of her illness. These findings provide clarification of the nature of the prosopagnosic disturbance and new information about the processes by which faces are recognized. They suggest that (1) prosopagnosia may result from a breakdown at different levels of face-recognition processes, (2) prosopagnosia may occur in spite of normal configurational encoding of facial representations, (3) covert recognition of overtly unrecognized faces requires the integrity of perceptual processes, and (4) failure of overt face recognition reflects a disturbance in the normal interactions between pertinent memories and facial representations which thus remain meaningless.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effects of oxidative stress on cardiac membrane currents, single cells from frog ventricle were exposed to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP). Incubation of these cells with 2 mM t-BHP causes a rapid depletion of cellular glutathione, followed by a more gradual increase in the contents of malonaldialdehyde and conjugated dienes. Effects of this rapidly evolving oxidative stress were studied on sodium, calcium, and potassium currents of isolated ventricular cells. t-BHP caused a progressive decrease in the magnitude of sodium current obtained on depolarization from a holding potential of -85 mV, which was accompanied by a shift in the reversal potential toward more negative potentials. The voltage dependence of the steady-state parameters for activation and inactivation was shifted, such that in peroxide-exposed cells, there was a greater overlap of activation and inactivation parameters, which would be expected to result in an increased window current. In addition, in the presence of t-BHP, the time constant for activation was decreased at most depolarizing potentials, whereas the time constant for inactivation was increased. The resultant sodium current transients were, therefore, slower in the presence of the peroxide because of slower inactivation. Prolonged exposure of the cells to t-BHP led to a complete and selective inhibition of the Na+ current. However, even when all the Na+ current was inhibited, the K+ and Ca2+ currents remained essentially unaltered. Also, no large outward currents were observed at this stage, indicating that ATP concentration was not drastically decreased. The barrier properties of plasma membrane remained intact, as it was possible to form gigohm seals between the patch pipette and the plasma membrane of cells treated with 2-14 mM t-BHP for up to 30 minutes. These results account for the proarrhythmic effects of free radicals and oxidative stress on cardiac tissues.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of diet-induced, moderate elevation of serum cholesterol on vascular reactivity in isolated rabbit abdominal aortic rings was examined by using a series of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agonists. Serum cholesterol of rabbits that were fed a cholesterol-free, casein-rich diet for 10 weeks was elevated approximately 4.5-fold compared with values found in control rabbits that were fed standard lab chow (223 +/- 41 versus 51 +/- 5 mg/dl, respectively). Relaxation responses to carbamylcholine chloride and (+/-)-isoproterenol hydrochloride in vessels from hypercholesterolemic rabbits were markedly inhibited in the presence of norepinephrine, prostaglandin F2 alpha, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and angiotensin II but not in the presence of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. The depressed vasodilation in hypercholesterolemic vessels appeared to depend on the agonist initiating the contraction. Sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxations were unchanged in rings from hypercholesterolemic rabbits compared with rings from control rabbits for all contractile agonists except KCl. Isolated aortic rings from hypercholesterolemic rabbits exhibited a slight but significantly increased vasoconstrictor sensitivity to 5-hydroxytryptamine and KCl but not to norepinephrine, prostaglandin F2 alpha, angiotensin II, or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate compared with aortic rings from control rabbits. These results demonstrate that modest elevation of serum cholesterol is sufficient to depress vasodilator and enhance vasoconstrictor responses to certain agonists. Vasodilator effects are impaired to a greater extent by a small increase in serum cholesterol than are responses to vasoconstrictor agonists. It is postulated that the induction of differential alterations in vascular reactivity with moderate increase in serum cholesterol may represent important early events predisposing arteries to vasospasm.\r"

We compared the effects of this \"depletion regimen\" with the responses in two control groups: a stimulation control group, which was subjected to high-frequency right vagus stimulation only, and a drug control group, which received a hemicholinium-3 infusion only. The effects of right vagus stimulation did not differ from those of left vagus stimulation in either of the control groups. In the animals subjected to the depletion regimen, the responses to right vagus stimulation were almost abolished. However, the left vagus nerve retained its ability to prolong cardiac cycle length in these animals. Thus, our experiments indicate that left vagus preganglionic fibers do not converge with right vagus preganglionic fibers on a substantial pool of postganglionic neurons that innervate the canine sinoatrial node.\r"

Contractions ceased in one beat when extracellular Ca2+ was decreased from 1mM to micromolar levels using a rapid perfusion technique. On reperfusion with 1 mM Ca2+, recovery of control contraction amplitude occurred after significantly fewer beats in neonatal myocytes compared with adult myocytes, and after 1 minute compared with 5 minutes of reduced Ca2+. After 15 minutes of perfusion with either 1 or 10 microM ryanodine, contraction amplitude decreased in both age groups, but the decrease was significantly greater in adults than in neonates. These experiments indicate that isolated ventricular myocytes may be used in the study of developmental changes in intracellular Ca2+ regulation. Results suggest that cardiac contraction in neonates is relatively more dependent on transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, although Ca2+ release from intracellular storage sites is present in both neonates and adults, its role in cardiac contraction is more significant in adults.\r"

We examined the number of slow calcium channels, calcium uptake via slow calcium channels, calcium pool sizes, and the contractile response to Bay K 8644, verapamil, and nifedipine using isolated cardiac myocytes from 8-9-month-old CM hamsters (BIO 14.6) and age-matched normal controls. The number of dihydropyridine binding sites as assessed by specific binding of [3H]PN200-110 was similar in the two groups (control hearts: Bmax = 333 +/- 89 [mean +/- SD] fmol/mg; CM hearts: Bmax = 357 +/- 75 fmol/mg; n = 5 experiments, p = 0.6). Current density through L-type calcium channels was determined using the whole-cell clamp technique (at -50 mV holding potential and -10 mV test potential) and was the same in CM myocytes (17.8 +/- 1.5 [mean +/- SD] pA/pF) and control myocytes (18.6 +/- 2.1 pA/pF) (n = 5 experiments, p = 0.5). The current-voltage relation (test potentials varied from -40 to +50 mV) was also the same in CM and control cells, as was apparent threshold, peak current, and reversal potential. However, the initial rate of 45Ca influx as well as the size of the rapidly exchangeable calcium pool was significantly greater in myocytes obtained from CM than from normal hamsters. In both myocyte preparations, Bay K 8644 increased the rate of 45Ca uptake by 25% at 60 seconds; verapamil decreased 45Ca uptake at 60 seconds by 16% and 17% in normal and CM hamsters, respectively. A similar inhibitory effect was observed with nifedipine. The amplitude of cell motion in cells driven at 1.5 Hz as assessed by an optical-video system increased progressively with increasing concentrations of extracellular calcium or Bay K 8644 in cardiac myocytes from normal or CM hamsters. However, the concentration-effect curves for the two effectors were shifted to the left in CM cells compared with cells from normal hamsters. Both preparations demonstrated similar contractile responses to verapamil and nifedipine. These findings demonstrate that single enzymatically dissociated cardiac myocytes from CM hamsters have impaired contractile properties analogous to those seen in the intact heart and thus provide a useful experimental system in which to study underlying cellular mechanisms operative in this model of heart failure. Our results further indicate that calcium overload in CM hamster cardiac myocytes may not be due to increased calcium influx via dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels, as suggested previously, but rather to abnormalities of intracellular calcium homeostasis.\r"

  ".U": "90374467\r", 
  ".W": "A prolongation of the ventricular effective refractory period in response to cholinergic agonists or vagal stimulation has been demonstrated in a number of in vivo animal models. However, exposure of isolated myocardial tissues obtained from these hearts to as much as 10(-4) M acetylcholine has been shown to produce essentially no change in action potential duration or effective refractory period. The discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro findings generally has been explained on the basis of accentuated antagonism, whereby parasympathetic agonists exert their influence through antagonism of the effects of beta-adrenergic tone in vivo. The fact that acetylcholine exerts little if any direct effect on the electrical activity of ventricular myocardium, although well accepted, is based exclusively on studies performed using endocardial preparations. Our recent demonstration of major electrophysiological differences between canine ventricular endocardium and epicardium prompted us to examine the effects of acetylcholine and the role of accentuated antagonism in these two tissue types. Using standard microelectrode techniques, we show that acetylcholine (10(-7)-10(-5) M) has little if any effect in canine ventricular endocardium but a pronounced effect to either prolong or markedly abbreviate action potential duration and effective refractory period in epicardium. These effects of acetylcholine on epicardium are attended by an accentuation of the spike and dome morphology of the action potential, are readily reversed with atropine, fail to appear when epicardium is pretreated with the transient outward current blocker 4-aminopyridine, are accentuated in the presence of isoproterenol (10(-7) to 5 x 10(-6) M), and persist in the presence of propranolol. Isoproterenol-induced abbreviation of action potential duration and effective refractory period is also shown to be more pronounced in epicardium than in endocardium; equimolar concentrations of acetylcholine completely antagonize the effects of isoproterenol in endocardium and epicardium. We conclude that acetylcholine exerts important direct effects on the electrical response of canine ventricular myocardium, which are accentuated in the presence of beta-adrenergic agonists. Our findings suggest the differential response of epicardium and endocardium to acetylcholine is due to the presence of a transient outward current-mediated spike and dome morphology in the epicardial action potential. Finally, the data suggest that acetylcholine may exert antiarrhythmic as well as arrhythmogenic effects through its actions to alter conduction and refractoriness.\r"

  ".U": "90374469\r", 
  ".W": "We previously found that superoxide dismutase (SOD) did not limit myocardial infarct size after 40 or 90 minutes of ischemia and 4 days of reperfusion in dogs. Because some other studies have shown limitation of infarct size after shorter periods of reperfusion, we postulated that our negative results might be due to late reperfusion injury mediated by superoxide anions produced after excretion of SOD. To test this \"early protection-delayed death\" hypothesis, we have examined whether SOD, conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG-SOD) to prolong its circulating half-life, limited myocardial infarct size. The circumflex artery was occluded for 90 minutes followed by 4 days of reperfusion. PEG-SOD (total dose, 10,000 units/kg) and catalase (55,000 units/kg) were given during the 30 minutes before reperfusion. Plasma SOD levels in the treated group were 330 +/- 20 units/ml at the onset of reperfusion and 140 +/- 10 units/ml on day 4 (circulating half-life, 75 +/- 5 hours) versus 5 +/- 1 units/ml in controls. Histological infarct size was 37.1 +/- 4.2% of the area at risk in the treated group (n = 11) versus 44.5 +/- 6.2% in controls (n = 10) (p = NS). Infarct size and collateral blood flow were inversely related in controls; PEG-SOD and catalase did not shift this regression (p = NS by analysis of covariance). Thus, infarct size was not limited when measured after 4 days of reperfusion, even though plasma SOD exceeded 100 units/ml throughout this reperfusion period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the role of extracellular magnesium on capillary endothelial cell migration and proliferation, components of endothelial cell function that play an important role in angiogenesis and wound healing. Cell migration and proliferation were tested in six different MgSO4 concentrations and in various culture conditions. The Boyden chamber procedure was used to evaluate migration of bovine adrenal cortex capillary endothelial cells. We found that low magnesium concentration inhibited cell migration, but a dose-dependent increase in migration was observed when magnesium level was increased beyond the normal serum concentration (up to 2.4 mM magnesium; p less than 0.0001). Cell proliferation was also inhibited by very low magnesium concentration, an effect observed under all conditions studied. When cell proliferation was stimulated by acidic or basic fibroblast growth factors, it appeared that a ceiling was reached, an increasing magnesium concentration had no additional stimulatory effect. However, a dose-dependent increase in proliferation (p less than 0.005) was observed when magnesium concentration was increased above the normal serum level (0.8 mM) in culture conditions that did not cause marked cell proliferation. Thus, magnesium has an important role in endothelial cell migration and proliferation: very low extracellular magnesium concentrations inhibit and supranormal levels enhance both migration and proliferation. These results suggest that magnesium deficiency might adversely influence the healing and reendothelialization of vascular injuries and the healing of myocardial infarction and might also result in delayed or inadequate angiogenesis, effects potentially leading to infarct expansion and inadequate collateral development.\r"

  ".W": "Spatially localized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to investigate with transmural differentiation the response of myocardial high energy phosphate compounds and inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) to graded reductions in coronary blood flow caused by sustained coronary stenosis. In an open-chest model, localized 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra from five layers across the left ventricular wall were obtained simultaneously with transmural blood flow measurements during control conditions and during sustained graded reductions in intracoronary pressure. Both the blood flow, and high energy phosphate and Pi contents displayed transmural heterogeneity in response to decreases in intracoronary pressure. The subendocardial creatine phosphate (CP) level remained unchanged as blood flow was reduced to approximately 0.7 ml/min/g wet wt and decreased precipitously beyond this critical flow level. The relation between CP and flow in the midmyocardium and especially in the subepicardium was more complex. Subepicardial CP content did not correlate well with blood flow; however, in cases in which a coronary stenosis resulted in subendocardial hypoperfusion but subepicardial flow was near or above normal, a close correlation was present between subepicardial and subendocardial CP levels. ATP levels in all layers remained unaltered until blood flow was severely reduced. These results demonstrate that 1) the myocardial high energy phosphate and Pi levels at any transmural layer are not generally determined by O2 and blood flow limitation under basal conditions; 2) during subtotal coronary occlusion, increased oxygen extraction is able to meet myocardial needs until a critical level of stenosis is reached; 3) below a critical flow level, subendocardial CP and Pi contents are closely correlated with absolute subendocardial blood flow; and 4) in the presence of a coronary stenosis, subepicardial CP and Pi contents may change even in the absence of perfusion deficit secondary to loss of subendocardial function.\r"

Basal systemic blood pressure, heart rate, blood gases, total CBF, and prostanoid concentrations were stable. CBF was constant between 50 and 90 mm Hg, but beyond this range CBF varied directly with blood pressure (tau = 0.48; p less than 0.05). Sagittal sinus concentrations of PGE, PGF2 alpha, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha varied with blood pressure according to a quadratic function (R2 = 0.92 to 0.96; p less than 0.0001), exhibiting lowest values between mean blood pressures of 60 and 90 mm Hg. During hypotension (17-49 mm Hg), there was a greater relative increase in sagittal sinus concentrations of TXB2 than of PGE, PGF2 alpha, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha; at the lowest blood pressures, TXB2 increased by 658 +/- 44%, and prostaglandins increased on the average by 331 +/- 49% (p less than 0.01) from their values during normotension (50-90 mm Hg). During hypertension (91-117 mm Hg), cerebrovascular production and concentrations of prostaglandins increased by 142 +/- 31% and 45 +/- 10%, respectively, but did not change for TXB2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean potential and ventriculographic configurations were determined for 15 groups, each formed on the basis of significant luminal occlusion (less than or equal to 90%) of an individual coronary arterial subdivision. We mathematically extracted distinctive map and wall motion patterns specific for isolated occlusion of each of the 15 major subdivisions. For these prototypes we found the following: 1) Definitive change in electrical pattern (less than 2 SD from the normal mean) occurred frequently outside the electrode sites of the standard electrocardiogram. 2) Focal akinesis systematically followed lesion site down the arterial courses; early electrical activation patterns corresponded to identifiable anatomic loss. 3) Certain paradoxes arose, for example, similar wall motion change but quite dissimilar electrical patterns from posterior descending artery occlusion of right coronary versus left circumflex origin. This technique unmasks component surface electrical patterns and ventriculographic deformities otherwise unrecognized in multisite, multivessel disease.\r"

  ".W": "We studied calcium responsiveness of skinned muscle preparations from the right and left ventricles of rats with cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac hypertrophy plus failure. To test the hypothesis that differences in contractile function are due to changes in myofilament calcium responsiveness, we compared preparations from spontaneously hypertensive rats with cardiac failure, spontaneously hypertensive rats without cardiac failure, and age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto control rats 18-24 months of age. Rats with failure had pleural/pericardial effusions, left atrial thrombi, and right and left ventricular hypertrophy. Muscles were skinned by saponin (250 micrograms/ml) and activated with a series of calcium buffers. Data were plotted as pCa (-log[Ca2+]) versus isometric force and then fit to a modified Hill equation. Values for 50% maximal activation (calcium sensitivity), maximal calcium-activated force, and the slope of the calcium-force relation were compared. Our data indicate that with the development of hypertrophy, calcium sensitivity of left ventricular muscles remains unaffected, but maximal calcium-activated force is increased. In contrast, maximal calcium-activated force declines toward control levels with the development of left ventricular failure, despite the continued presence of significant hypertrophy. In the normotensive rats, the left ventricle is more sensitive to calcium than the right ventricle (pCa50 = 6.0 +/- 0.05 versus 5.7 +/- 0.09; p less than 0.05); however, both the calcium sensitivity and maximal calcium-activated force of the right ventricle increase with the development of compensatory hypertrophy secondary to left ventricular failure. These changes that occur in rats with cardiac hypertrophy and failure may represent important physiological adaptive mechanisms.\r"

We sought to determine the functional distribution of the neuropeptide Y-containing sympathetic fibers to the sinus and atrioventricular (AV) nodal regions. We recorded cycle length, AV interval, and arterial pressure in 14 anesthetized dogs. We assessed the release of neuropeptide Y from sympathetic nerve terminals by measuring the attenuation of the vagal effects on cycle length and AV interval that occurred after unilateral ansa subclavia stimulation. Three-minute trains of right or left ansa stimulation, each applied at frequencies of 2, 5, and 10 Hz, produced a frequency-dependent inhibition of the vagal effects on cycle length and AV interval. After right ansa stimulation (10 Hz), however, the percent inhibition of the vagal effects on cycle length was 21 +/- 5% greater (p less than 0.001) than the percent inhibition of the vagal effects on AV interval. Conversely, after left ansa stimulation (10 Hz), the percent inhibition of the vagal effects on AV interval was 54 +/- 7% greater (p less than 0.001) than the percent inhibition of the vagal effects on cycle length. The vagal stimulus characteristics (frequency or voltage) did not significantly alter the percent inhibition, nor did the percent inhibition depend on the vagus stimulated (right or left vagus). We conclude that most of the neuropeptide Y-containing sympathetic fibers at the sinus node originate in right-sided ganglia, whereas most of those at the AV node originate in left-sided ganglia.\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that the mesenteric resistance blood vessels have nonadrenergic, noncholinergic vasodilator innervation in which calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a possible neurotransmitter. The role of CGRP-containing vasodilator nerves in hypertension was investigated in perfused mesenteric vascular beds isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The adrenergic vasoconstrictor responses to perivascular nerve stimulation in both SHR (8-, 15-, and 30-week-old) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat preparations increased with aging, but the response was greater in SHR than in WKY rats at all ages. The preparation isolated from SHR and WKY rats was precontracted by continuous perfusion of Krebs' solution containing 7 x 10(-6) M methoxamine plus 5 x 10(-6) M guanethidine. In both SHR and WKY rats, perivascular nerve stimulation (1-8 Hz) produced frequency-dependent vasodilation, which was blocked by 1 x 10(-7) M tetrodotoxin, pretreatment with 5 x 10(-7) M capsaicin, and denervation by cold storage (4 degrees C for 72 hours). The vasodilation induced by perivascular nerve stimulation in SHR greatly decreased with age, whereas a slight decrease in the response with age was found in WKY rats. The neurogenic vasodilation in the young SHR preparation was similar in magnitude to the vasodilation in age-matched WKY rats, whereas the vasodilation in 15- and 30-week-old SHR was significantly smaller than that in age-matched WKY rats. In both SHR and WKY rats, perfusion of rat CGRP (1 x 10(-10) to 3 x 10(-8) M) produced marked vasodilation in a concentration-dependent manner. The CGRP-induced vasodilation in SHR increased with age, whereas an age-related decrease in vasodilation was found in WKY rats. Perivascular nerve stimulation (4 and 8 Hz) of the perfused mesenteric vascular bed evoked an increased release of CGRP-like immunoreactive substance in the perfusate, which was significantly less in 15-week-old SHR than in age-matched WKY rats. Immunohistochemical studies showed an age-related decrease in CGRP-like immunoreactive fibers in SHR but not in WKY rats. These results suggest that CGRP-containing vasodilator innervation is greatly decreased when SHR develop and maintain hypertension. It is also suggested that the decreased vasodilator mechanism by CGRP-containing nerves contributes to the development and maintenance of hypertension.\r"

Its assay gives controversial results for other species, for example, rabbits and humans. Therefore, we perfused isolated hearts of various species, including explanted human hearts, to measure the conversion of exogenous hypoxanthine to xanthine and urate. We assayed these purines with high-performance liquid chromatography. The apparent xanthine oxidoreductase activities, calculated as release of xanthine plus 2x urate, were (milliunits per gram wet weight, mean +/- SEM) mice 33 +/- 3 (n = 5), rats 28.5 +/- 1.4 (n = 9), guinea pigs 14.4 +/- 1.0 (n = 5), rabbits 0.59 +/- 0.09 (n = 5), pigs less than 0.1 (n = 6), humans 0.31 +/- 0.04 (n = 7), and cows 3.7 +/- 0.8 (n = 4). In rabbit heart the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine was slow, and that of xanthine to urate was even slower. On the other hand, guinea pig and human heart released little xanthine, indicating that xanthine breakdown exceeds its formation. We conclude that isolated perfused mouse, rat, guinea pig, and also bovine hearts show considerable xanthine oxidoreductase activity, contrasting rabbit, porcine, and diseased human hearts.\r"

Swimming resulted in hypertrophy (11-12%) of the in situ hearts in both the unoperated and operated animals compared with the matched sedentary controls. The cardiac isograft exhibited atrophy (32-35%), which was not attenuated by swimming. The cardiac isograft was also associated with a decrease in the percent of V1 myosin isoenzyme, which was attenuated by swimming (45 +/- 5% versus 66 +/- 6%). Swimming also increased the percent of this isomyosin in the in situ hearts of operated rats. These data suggest that hemodynamic load and/or neural innervation are necessary for hypertrophy associated with chronic conditioning by swimming, whereas myosin isoenzyme control is significantly mediated by humoral factors.\r"

Eight women with normal tubes served as controls and 36 women with tubal damage underwent falloposcopy in an attempt to document endotubal defects. Previous salpingectomy in 13 women and ostial obstruction in 4 cases left 71 tubes available for falloposcopy. Technical failures, defined as an inability to negotiate the tubal lumen in the absence of obstructive disease occurred in 8 of 71 (11%) procedures. In 63 successful procedures, the tubal lumen was considered to be falloposcopically normal in 28 cases (44%) and contained defects ranging from partial to total obstruction secondary to intraluminal fibrosis within the intramural, isthmic, and ampullary segments in the remaining 35 tubes (56%).

Outcome was evaluated at 18 months postoperatively. Twenty-two patients obtained pregnancies (33.8%), of which 18 were intrauterine (27.7%). The intrauterine pregnancy rate was 25.8% after fimbrioplasty and 29.4% after neosalpingostomy. These results are comparable with those obtained after microsurgery. Progress in operative laparoscopy may be attributed to the development of an appropriate atraumatic instrumentation and the CO2 laser. The major advantage of laparoscopic techniques is their availability at the time of diagnostic laparoscopy. Immediate opening of hydrosalpinges allows for precise evaluation of the tubal mucosa, thereby establishing prognosis. In cases with a severely altered mucosa, in vitro fertilization may be considered immediately. When the mucosa is satisfactory, laparoscopic fimbrioplasty or neosalpingostomy may be performed. Within 1 year after one of these procedures, a pregnancy is generally achieved in 1 of 3 patients.\r"

This is associated with increased calcium mobilization from bone and bone loss. To better understand the effect of estrogen (E) status on calcium metabolism during lactation, we studied 10 long-term lactating women at 12 weeks postpartum when they were hypoestrogenic and again at 37.4 +/- 3.4 (+/- SD) weeks during the midfollicular phase of their second ovulatory cycle. Urinary and serum markers of calcium metabolism were measured at these intervals. The results revealed that when E was low, osteocalcin and hydroxyproline were increased with a lower circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, whereas reciprocal changes were noted when E was increased. The findings suggest that E status can modulate PTH's ability to mobilize one's stores of calcium.\r"

  ".W": "Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) was used as a treatment for long-standing nontubal infertility for a 2-year period. The overall clinical pregnancy rate for 114 tubal transfers was 40.4% with a delivery/ongoing rate of 34.2%. Concurrent use of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) for tubal factor infertility gave significantly lower clinical pregnancy and delivery/ongoing rates (21.1% and 15.8%, respectively). The use of gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) for nontubal infertility yielded a 32% clinical pregnancy rate and a 26% delivery rate for 53 transfers. Zygote intrafallopian transfer resulted in an implantation rate per zygote of 17% overall compared with 8.1% per embryo for IVF-ET and 11.2% per oocyte for GIFT. The transfer of three zygotes per patient gave the same clinical pregnancy rate as the transfer of four while reducing the incidence of multiple gestation from 19% to 7.8% per transfer. No significant decline in the clinical pregnancy or delivery rate was seen with ZIFT in women aged 25 through 39.\r"

The minimum concentration of motile sperm from fertile controls necessary to validate HZA results was 250,000/mL (35.4 +/- 5.6 tightly bound sperm; mean +/- SE). The \"effective number of sperm\" (morphologically normal with high motility) was 60,750/mL. Each teratozoospermic patient had a unique, (higher) sperm insemination concentration (range: 0.5 X 10(6) to 2.0 X 10(6) motile sperm/mL) necessary to equal the number of tightly bound sperm representing the lower 95% confidence interval for the control sample (at 0.5 X 10(6) motile sperm/mL) with the matching hemizona. These results suggest that the HZA may be used as an indicator of the sperm insemination concentration during in vitro fertilization in patients with teratozoospermia.\r"

Artificial donor insemination was offered if in the test the percentage of hamster oocytes with at least one decondensed sperm head (oocyte-sperm interaction rate) was less than 20. If the rate was less than 5, the pregnancy rate after coitus was significantly lower than in the group with a rate of greater than or equal to 5 to less than 20. In the former group, the pregnancy rate by AID was significantly higher than the pregnancy rate by coitus. We conclude that the zona-free hamster oocyte test is useful to predict the chance to achieve pregnancy in couples with unexplained infertility and to determine whether AID can increase this chance.\r"

However, the mechanisms of such restriction are not well understood. Using videomicrography to simultaneously analyze the motions and morphology of individual human sperm, we analyzed differential penetration of normal and abnormal sperm into fresh human cervical mucus. Abnormal sperm swam slower in mucus than the normal sperm, but their flagellar beat parameters were not commensurately different. Multivariate statistical analysis of the relationship between individual sperm velocity and flagellar beat parameters indicated that the heads of the abnormal sperm experienced greater resistance from the mucus than did normal heads. Differential mucus resistance, more than altered motile vigor, appears to be responsible for the restriction of abnormal sperm during migration through mucus.\r"

The endosalpingeal grafts interfered with implantation as evidenced by four observations: (1) The nidation indices were lowered, (2) no implantations occurred on the grafted endosalpinx, (3) unattached blastocysts were found in animals grafted with endosalpinx, and (4) the implantation sites were significantly smaller in uterine horns containing endosalpingeal grafts. These findings suggest the presence of a factor in rabbit endosalpinx that actively suppresses ectopic implantation in the oviduct.\r"

There were no significant changes in IGFBP-1 levels; a small, but significant increase in PP14 levels after E2 plus MPA was noted, but there was substantial overlap between basal and postprogestogen therapy serum PP14 concentrations. Serum concentrations of PP14, but not IGFBP-1, were slightly higher in women whose endometrial biopsies demonstrated a P effect, but again, there was substantial overlap with the values found in women whose biopsies showed only an estrogen effect.

On testing with the KT-1000 arthrometer, 69 per cent of the patients had less than three millimeters of increased anterior-posterior displacement of the knee that had been operated on compared with the contralateral knee, 26 per cent had three to five millimeters, and 5 per cent had more than five millimeters. The knees that had a bone-patellar ligament-bone allograft had significantly lower values for anterior-posterior displacement than did those that had a fascia lata allograft (p less than 0.05). Just one patient, the only one in whom the fascia lata graft failed, had giving-way. There were no infections, and there was no evidence of rejection of the allograft or documented transmission of disease at the time of writing. A strict rating system was used. Eighteen patients (38 per cent) had an excellent result, twenty-four (51 per cent) had a good result, and five (11 per cent) had a fair or poor result. Motion of the knee immediately postoperatively was not deleterious to the allograft, and, because limitations of motion were identified and treated in the early postoperative period, full motion (0 to 135 degrees) was restored in all knees.\r"

The results of this study of 324 grafts, prepared and supplied by our hospital bone bank, showed that the patients in whom femoral head grafts and other small bone and soft-tissue allografts were used had a negligible clinical incidence of infection. The incidence of infection related to the use of large allografts, such as osteoarticular or diaphyseal grafts, was approximately 5 per cent in patients who had treatment for a bone tumor and 4 per cent in those who had revision of a hip arthroplasty. These rates of infection were not substantially different from those that have been reported in similar series in which large allografts or sterilized prosthetic devices were used. The causes of the infections were difficult to determine, but contamination of the allograft was probably not a factor in most patients.\r"

We studied the possibility that increased circulating growth factors or circulating factors that stimulate local release of growth factors mediate the increased osteogenesis. Samples of serum were obtained from thirty-two subjects: patients who had a head injury alone, those who had a head injury and fractures of the lower extremities, those who had only fractures, and control subjects who had neither a head injury nor a fracture. Severe head injury was defined as that producing coma of at least three days' duration. Growth-factor activity was determined by assessing the effect of serum on the incorporation of [3H]thymidine and on cell counts in primary cultures of osteoblastic cells from the calvaria of fetal rats. Samples of serum from the two groups of patients who had a head injury had higher mitogenic activity and produced a greater increase in the number of cells than did the samples from the other two groups. The mean levels of activity were not statistically different between the first two groups or between the patients who had fractures only and the control subjects. Dilution studies showed that increased mitogenic activity in the serum from the patients who had a head injury was dose-dependent. In three patients in whom it was studied, the mitogenic activity peaked approximately thirty-seven days after the head injury was sustained.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the residual deformity and late treatment of thirty-four hips of thirty-one children who had had septic arthritis when they were less than one year old. The hips were classified into four groups on the basis of radiographic changes. Type-I deformity (five hips) involved transient ischemia of the epiphysis, with or without mild coxa magna, and these hips did not need reconstruction. Type-II deformity (eleven hips) included deformity of the epiphysis, physis, and metaphysis, and these hips needed an operation to prevent subluxation; the goals of the operation included improvement in acetabular coverage, improvement in abductor efficiency by epiphyseodesis or transfer of the greater trochanter, and equalization of limb-length discrepancy by epiphyseodesis of the contralateral limb. Type-III deformity (five hips) involved malalignment of the femoral neck, with extreme anteversion or retroversion or with a pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck that necessitated a realignment osteotomy of the proximal part of the femur or bone-grafting of the pseudarthrosis. Type-IV deformity (thirteen hips) included destruction of the femoral head and neck, with persistence of only a remnant of the medial base of the femoral neck. In the hips that had a Type-IV deformity, the complex clinical problems, which included severe limb-length discrepancy and incompetent articulation of the hip, necessitated operations such as Pemberton osteotomy, trochanteric arthroplasty, arthrodesis, epiphyseodesis of the contralateral limb, and lengthening of the ipsilateral tibia. The functional result was satisfactory in all five hips that had a Type-I deformity, in seven of eleven that had a Type-II deformity, in three of four that had a Type-III deformity, and in only four of thirteen that had a Type-IV deformity.\r"

Six patients were immobilized postoperatively with halo fixation. There was only slight limitation of cervical motion after fusion; we believe that the limitation was due to increased motion in the vertebral segments caudad to the level of fusion. Six patients had full flexion, and only three patients had decreased rotation. We found that, in young patients, occipitocervical arthrodesis by means of the described procedure was both safe and effective.\r"

We studied the magnetic resonance-imaging scans of sixty-three volunteers who had no history of symptoms indicative of cervical disease. The scans were mixed randomly with thirty-seven scans of patients who had a symptomatic lesion of the cervical spine, and all of the scans were interpreted independently by three neuroradiologists. The scans were interpreted as demonstrating an abnormality in 19 per cent of the asymptomatic subjects: 14 per cent of those who were less than forty years old and 28 per cent of those who were older than forty. Of the subjects who were less than forty, 10 per cent had a herniated nucleus pulposus and 4 per cent had foraminal stenosis. Of the subjects who were older than forty, 5 per cent had a herniated nucleus pulposus; 3 per cent, bulging of the disc; and 20 per cent, foraminal stenosis. Narrowing of a disc space, degeneration of a disc, spurs, or compression of the cord were also recorded. The disc was degenerated or narrowed at one level or more in 25 per cent of the subjects who were less than forty years old and in almost 60 per cent of those who were older than forty. The prevalence of abnormal magnetic-resonance images of the cervical spine as related to age in asymptomatic individuals emphasizes the dangers of predicating operative decisions on diagnostic tests without precisely matching those findings with clinical signs and symptoms.\r"

In twenty adult miniature pigs, the nerve-roots of the cauda equina were compressed at pressures of zero (sham), fifty, 100, or 200 millimeters of mercury, and hypotension was induced with sodium nitroprusside. Compression was maintained for two hours, and a ninety-minute period of recovery followed. The nerve-roots were monitored electrophysiologically throughout the experiment. To assess the effect of compression and hypotension on the function of the nerve-roots, values of afferent and efferent amplitude and nerve-conduction velocity were compared with values in twenty adult miniature pigs that had similar graded compression without hypotension. Hypotension significantly affected efferent and afferent amplitudes at the end of the compression period; the effect remained significant at the end of the recovery period. The most profound effect of hypotension occurred during compression at fifty millimeters of mercury--a pressure that had no effect on the function of the nerves in normotensive animals.\r"

The average age was 43.2 years, and 86 per cent of them had participated regularly in sports but were disabled due to symptoms of impingement. All patients had had a minimum of six months of non-operative therapy. The final diagnoses, which were based on the findings at arthroscopy and on clinical examination, plain radiographs, and arthrograms, were Stage-II impingement in twenty-four patients, a partial-thickness tear of the rotator cuff in six, and a full-thickness tear of the rotator cuff in ten. The shoulders were scored before the operation and again at follow-up. Preoperatively, thirty-six shoulders were rated as poor and four, as fair. After a minimum follow-up of twelve months (average, seventeen months), the scores had increased in all but one patient. The result was rated good or excellent in twenty-nine (73 per cent) of the forty patients: twenty of the twenty-four who had Stage-II impingement, four of the six who had a partial-thickness tear, and six of the ten who had a full-thickness tear. The over-all average time to return to work was nine days, and the average time to return to sports was 2.4 months. Of the thirty-three patients who had participated in sports, twenty-five (76 per cent) had returned to sports activity at the time of the most recent follow-up. The average time until full recovery was 3.8 months. There were no complications, and, over-all, thirty-eight (92 per cent) of the forty patients were satisfied with the result. In four patients, the result was a failure, and three of the four had a reoperation that relieved the symptoms.\r"

Eleven fractures were treated non-operatively with a brace or cast, and there were five non-unions, two delayed unions, and two malunions. Of the ten fractures that were treated operatively, three that were treated by compression-plating all united. Two fractures were treated by external fixation; one had a delayed union and one, a malunion.

Nine of the neural injuries in eight patients spontaneously resolved at a mean of 2.5 months (range, 1.5 to five months) after injury. The remaining nine lesions in five patients were explored at a mean of 7.5 months (range, five to fourteen months) after injury, because clinical and electromyographic studies showed no return of function. Neurolysis was performed on eight of the nerves that were explored (in five patients), and the remaining radial nerve was found to be completely lacerated and needed nerve-grafting. The length of follow-up after neurolysis averaged twenty-five months (range, thirteen to forty-four months). All five patients had functional recovery, as documented by range-of-motion, grip-strength and lateral pinch-strength, and von Frey and two-point-discrimination sensory testing. The patient who had had nerve-grafting never recovered neural function, and tendon transfers were needed. We concluded that observation and supportive therapy is the preferred initial approach for children who have a neural injury associated with a closed, displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus. However, if there is no clinical or electromyographic evidence of return of neural function at five months after injury, exploration and neurolysis should be performed. If the nerve is in continuity, the prognosis after neurolysis is excellent.\r"

All of the patients had been functioning well, and only one of the prostheses showed radiographic evidence of loosening. Serial sections of the proximal portion of the femur that enclosed the femoral component of the prosthesis showed that the host bone was intimately and directly apposed to the cement, and fibrous tissue intervened only rarely. The bone-remodeling processes had created a dense shell of substantial new bone around the cement-mantle that resembled a new cortex, attached to the outer cortex by new trabecular struts. Evidence of ingrowth of bone from this dense shell of bone into the undulating surface of the cement was found in many areas. In the adjacent femoral cortex, there was substantial osteoporosis and cortical thinning. The cement-bone interface was intact and excellent throughout, despite the presence of fractures within the cement-mantle and de-bonding at the cement-prosthesis interface in some specimens. The cemented femoral components were well tolerated by the skeleton over a long period of use, and fibrous tissue had rarely formed at the femoral cement-bone interface of these well fixed and clinically successful prostheses. The cement-mantle was well supported by extensive medullary bone-remodeling and formation of a dense shell of new bone. The internal bone-remodeling helped to maintain the cemented femoral components over time and did not cause loosening of the prosthesis.\r"

The incidence of hyperpigmentation was related both to vessel size and to sclerosing solution; only one patient showed hyperpigmentation in a vessel less than 1 mm, while in 1-2 mm vessels the incidence was 10.9% for HS and 30.7% for 1% POL (p less than .004) at 1 month. At 6 months postsclerotherapy, the incidence of pigmentation was 2% for HS and 7.5% for 1% POL. Both the type and concentration of sclerosing solution affected the incidence of TM; the incidence of TM was 33% for 1% POL, compared to only 13% for HS (p less than .004). At 6 months follow-up, the incidence of TM decreased to 2% for HS and 9% for 1% POL. Ten patients who developed TM with 1% POL were treated subsequently with 0.5% POL and demonstrated no matting. These data indicate that the incidence of side effects was affected by both the concentration and type of sclerosant.\r"

A new and simple test is applied to determine if the resulting varicosity is necessary to contribute to venous circulation in the limb and if subfascial collateral pathways are sufficient to maintain it. The test is a modification of the Perthes test. Instead of a rubber-strip tourniquet, a tensiometer cuff is used with 110 mmHg for 5 minutes on a walking patient. In negative cases the superficial varicosity can be removed radically, in spite of deep venous occlusion, to decrease the venous blood loading and ameliorate the venous drainage without risk to the blood circulation.\r"

Twenty-four female subjects were divided into three groups: normal-weight restrained eaters (no. = 8), normal-weight non-restrained eaters (no. = 7), and over-weight restrained eaters (no. = 9). Classification of subjects was based on body mass and restrained eating score. Five preloads varying in energy content (393 or 67 kcal) and type of sweeteners (sucrose or cyclamate) were served 1/2 hour before test meals of assorted hors d'oeuvres. Subjects were not informed of the specific aim of the study, and were instructed to eat until full. Multivariate analysis of variance of repeated measures showed that food intake of all subjects was higher after eating low-energy preloads than after eating high-energy preloads, although subjects did not recognize the effect in self-reports (p less than .01). The energy intake of restrained normal-weight eaters was significantly (p less than .05) lower after eating sweet preloads than after eating non-sweet preloads. Findings suggest that a food-intake control mechanism responds to short-term energy deficits among subjects of varied body mass and restrained eating indexes. J Am Diet Assoc 90:1223-1228, 1990.\r"

Patterns of food use were determined through long-term observation, dietary histories, and 24-hour dietary recalls. Dietary intake was determined through 24-hour dietary recalls over 7 consecutive days. Patterns of food acquisition, selection, and preparation were similar for obese and non-obese Hualapai women. The diets of both groups were dominated by nonalcoholic beverages, potatoes, beans, white wheat flour, and canned goods. Wild and locally cultivated foods were not eaten on a regular basis. The diets of both the obese and non-obese women were high in energy (pooled mean +/- standard deviation [SD] = 2,602 +/- 766 kcal/day) and carbohydrates (pooled mean +/- SD = 333.4 +/- 95.6 gm/day), moderate in protein (pooled mean +/- SD = 77.8 +/- 20.9 gm/day) and fat (pooled mean +/- SD = 101.1 +/- 25.4 gm/day), and low in crude fiber (pooled mean +/- SD = 4.7 +/- 2.0 gm/day).

A three-part (influence, demographic, activity) questionnaire was developed and mailed to 600 randomly selected members of the Nutrition Support dietetic practice group. Usable responses were received from 458 dietitians, yielding a response rate of 77%. Factor analysis revealed that respondents assumed five of six possible postures of influence techniques (block/threaten, ingratiation, coalition, assertiveness, and transitional rationality) and three of four possible postures of activity (diet oriented, physician oriented, and case oriented). Multivariate analysis showed use of ingratiation techniques related inversely to age and education of practitioners, use of assertiveness techniques related inversely to age, and use of transitional rationality techniques related positively to age and education combined. The survey indicates that somewhat of a paradox exists among clinical dietitians; i.e., even though the percentage of selected practitioners performing high-level case-oriented activities has apparently declined since 1982, a critical number perceive themselves to be acculturating toward the sixth and highest influence (convincing rationality) and the highest activity (diagnosis and research orientation unique to dietetics) postures to be attained.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have documented an increasing prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity in the United States. These increases will likely result in increased adult obesity because of the tracking of fatness from adolescence into adulthood and the tendency for adults in the United States to become obese as they age. We have identified television viewing as a strong risk factor for childhood and adolescent obesity. Television viewing is associated with both the onset of obesity and a decrease in the remission of obesity and acts by decreasing activity levels and possibly influencing diet. Logistic regressions also document associations between television viewing and obesity among adults. These relationships are greater than those estimated between measures of vigorous physical activity and obesity and indicate the importance of inactivity, to which television viewing contributes substantially. Population dietary intake data indicated no statistically significant change and perhaps some decrease in mean energy intake among children and youth during the same period that obesity was increasing. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that decreases in activity reduce lean body mass and lower energy requirements. We conclude that multiple intervention approaches involving diet, exercise, and restriction of television viewing and other sedentary activities all appear necessary to halt the fattening of America.\r"

A study was conducted to examine total weight loss for individually counseled patients seen in a hospital outpatient nutrition clinic February to October 1986. All patients who lost weight were contacted via telephone 1 year later to ascertain weight loss maintenance. During this period, 157 patients were seen. In an average of five visits, 119 (75%) lost an average of 9 lb. One year later, 73 (61%) of these patients were contacted, 54 of whom (74%) reported that they had either maintained or lost additional weight during the year. Sixteen (30%) of these 54 individuals lost additional weight during the year--an average of 13 additional lb. Results were similar for men and women. Although based on a small sample size, the results suggest that weight loss counseling can be successful in maintaining as well as losing weight. Such results should encourage dietetic practitioners to track their own patients for long-term results and to share the results with physicians, administrators, and insurers who are concerned about whether their money has been well spent.\r"

However, with relapse of the disease, the serum NSE increased to 24.3 and 200.0 ng/ml, respectively. One patient died of lung and skin metastases 4 months after surgery; the other, who developed brain metastasis, was treated again with chemotherapy by the same regimen. The serum NSE level decreased to 13.0 ng/ml, and the symptoms improved.

They are on a number of medications and have multiple diseases. With impaired consciousness and swallowing disability, these patients are prone to develop pneumonia. In order to identify possible risk factors, we followed 24 men who underwent PEG for the occurrence of pneumonia or until they died. We then analyzed the medical records of these patients for potential risk factors for pneumonia. The presence of esophagitis during PEG placement endoscopy and history of pneumonia prior to PEG were significant risk factors. Advanced age and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) tended to indicate a higher risk of pneumonia. Taking these risk factors into consideration may be beneficial in the management of such patients.\r"

  ".W": "Fecal occult blood testing is used worldwide to screen for early detection of colorectal neoplasia. Because processing Hemoccult II cards is not difficult, it is very easy for inexperienced personnel to perform, and opens a way to overdiagnose positive tests. This could be followed by unnecessary, expensive diagnostic procedures and a significant decline in the test specificity. In a prospective study of two similar populations (two kibbutzim of the Upper Galilee in northern Israel), I compared the impact of processing the Hemoccult II cards on their positive predictive value for colonic cancer and adenomatous polyps. The inexperienced processor increased overall screening positivity fourfold (25 versus 6%, p less than 0.01). This was accompanied by a sharp decrease in the predictive value for adenomas greater than 1 cm (6 versus 25%, p less than 0.05) with no change in the final screening yield: 1.58 versus 1.53% of the participants had adenomas in kibbutz A and kibbutz B, respectively. I recommend that the Hemoccult II cards be processed by experienced personnel only.\r"

Thirty-eight of the 50 patients were able to provide the time of onset of biliary pain in the 24-h cycle. The time of onset of biliary pain displays significant circadian periodicity (p = 0.0032), with its peak at 00:25 h. Forty-five patients had more than 1 episode of pain. Of these 84% had either all or over half of their attacks of biliary pain at the same clock time. Twenty-two patients with renal colic (a close parallel to biliary pain) and 31 patients with episodic abdominal pain from miscellaneous causes showed no circadian or other periodicity in the time of onset of pain. In only 1 of these patients did the abdominal pain recur consistently at the same clock time. \"Typical\" biliary pain has its onset at night and tends to recur at the same clock time. It is steady and relatively mild, lasting 1-5 h, it is felt in the right upper quadrant or the epigastrium, may radiate to a variety of sites, is associated with some additional symptoms, and is not usually related to meals. The chronobiological and other features of biliary pain reported here should be useful in the diagnostic evaluation of abdominal pain.\r"

  ".W": "The significance of alkaline phosphatase (AP) elevation with otherwise normal transaminase and bilirubin values remains unclear. We evaluated the clinical outcome of hospitalized patients with an \"isolated\" AP elevation. Eighty-seven inpatients with isolated AP elevation were identified during February 1984 and followed for 1 year. Forty-five of 87 patients had normalization of AP during the follow-up period, usually within 1-3 months. The most common diagnoses in this group were congestive heart failure in nine, benign bone disease in six, and treatable malignancy in three patients. Twelve patients had no apparent explanation for the transient rise of AP. Persistent AP elevations were noted in 42 patients--14 of whom had terminal malignancies. Clinically obvious life-threatening diagnoses were made in 24 of the patients with persistent AP elevation. The etiology of AP elevation remained enigmatic in seven patients: two died, four are stable during 1 1/2-3 years of follow-up, and one patient was found to have metastatic carcinoma 17 months later. If the initial AP was greater than 1 1/2 times normal, there was a higher likelihood of persistent elevation (68% vs. 41%, p less than 0.05). Isolated elevations of AP in inpatients may be associated with a variety of medical illnesses and often normalize within months. If the AP elevation is persistent, there is usually a clinically obvious diagnosis. A reasonable approach to such patients is a careful history, physical exam, and routine lab studies to detect obvious diagnoses, followed by repeat enzyme determination at 1-3 months.\r"

  ".W": "Repeated surgical interventions on the biliary ductal system increase morbidity and mortality, particularly in the geriatric patient. In an attempt to prevent these complications, side-to-side choledochoduodenostomy was performed as the primary operative procedure in 54 patients, age 72 +/- 13 years. This was the patients' first surgical intervention for benign obstructive lesions of the biliary tract system. Indications for choledochoduodenostomy were: multiple or irremovable common or hepatic duct stones, doubtfulness of complete clearing of the duct, primary common bile duct stones or mud and sludge, a grossly dilated biliary duct system, and ampullary stenosis. We encountered no operative or hospital mortality among this group of 54 patients. The mean postoperative hospital stay for this aged and relatively sick group of patients was 12.3 +/- 6.2 days. Twenty-three minor postoperative complications occurred in 18 patients, none of them requiring reoperation. The patients were followed for 2-16 years. Thirteen patients (24%) were lost to follow-up. Of the 41 patients available for follow-up, 14 died, none from biliary tract associated causes--mostly from cerebrocardiovascular disease. Twenty-seven patients still alive were found to be free of biliary tract associated abdominal complaints or recurrent cholangitis for a mean period of 7.8 +/- 3.7 years. The data indicate a zero reoperation rate during long-term follow-up, zero mortality rate, and low morbidity in a group of elderly, mostly poor risk patients. This leads us to conclude that a side-to-side choledochoduodenostomy is both the best therapy as well as prophylaxis against common duct stones. This, even in this era of endoscopic papillotomy and biliary lithotripsy.\r"

This increase, which was related to the decreased stool pH, was more constant with lactulose. In addition, lactitol decreased certain proteolytic bacteria such as enterococci and enterobacteria. Both total aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts showed little quantitative variations with either treatment.\r"

All of these cases were middle-aged to elderly adults, and there was a slight female predominance of 2:1. Symptoms related to the liver were absent in all but two cases. NRHL was an incidental finding in these 12 cases at autopsy. The main other diseases in these cases were classified into four groups: (a) organic cardiac diseases (four cases), (b) pulmonary diseases with right-sided cardiac hypertrophy (four cases), (c) small arterial diseases involving the liver (two cases), and (d) systemic amyloidosis involving intrahepatic small arterial branches (two cases). The frequency of NRHL in these four groups at autopsy was 3.8, 7.1, 33.3, and 22.2%, respectively, suggesting that while NRHL is rare, clinicians should be aware of its association or development of NRHL in several conditions. Disturbances of outlet venous blood flow and inlet arterial blood flow may contribute to the development of NRHL in the former two and latter two groups, respectively.\r"
