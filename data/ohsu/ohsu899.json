  ".W": "To investigate the role of progesterone (P) in the early follicular phase, the antiprogesterone effect of RU486 was examined in five normally cycling women monitored by daily hormonal levels during three consecutive cycles (control, treatment, and recovery). In addition, luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse characteristics were assessed by frequent blood sampling (10 minutes for 10 hours) on day 3 of the control and the corresponding day of treatment cycles. Administration of RU486 (3 mg/kg, orally) for the first 3 days of the menstrual cycle did not significantly alter the length of the follicular phase (13.4 +/- 1.7 to 15.2 +/- 1.3 days), the LH surge, or the luteal phase length (12.2 +/- 0.5 to 12.6 +/- 0.7 days). The intermenstrual length of the treatment cycle (29.8 +/- 1.9 days) did not differ from the control (27.6 +/- 1.8 days) or recovery cycles (29.6 +/- 2.5 days). Integrated secretion of P and estradiol (E2) did not vary during the luteal phase of the control, treatment, or recovery cycles. During RU486 treatment, LH pulse frequency, pulse amplitude, and mean LH were not altered. Whereas mean E2 levels were significantly decreased from 150.5 +/- 15.1 to 110.1 +/- 7.0 pmol/L, follicle-stimulating hormone, P, adrenocorticotropin hormone, and cortisol were not significantly altered. Thus, in spite of the transient decrement in E2 secretion during RU486 treatment, the integrity of the ovulatory menstrual cycle was maintained. We conclude that administration of the antiprogesterone RU486 at the dose used during the first 3 days of the follicular phase does not perturb menstrual cyclicity.\r"

Sperm counts, sperm morphologies, and mean levels of testosterone (T), free T, sex hormone binding globulin, cortisol, follicle-stimulating hormone, and biologically active luteinizing hormone (LH) were similar in the two groups. Mean levels of immunologically active LH were somewhat higher in the marathoners.

However, in certain cases this correlation does not exist. The purpose of this study was to establish a reliable bioassay of FSH for the andrological clinic. Follicle-stimulating hormone was measured by both standard RIA and bioassay in 98 men subgrouped into normospermic, oligospermic, and azoospermic. Bioactivity of FSH was determined using in vitro cultures of granulosa cells utilizing progesterone measurements for assessing FSH activity. Results of FSH levels obtained by both methods correlated well (r = 0.55, P less than 0.01) within themselves, and both correlated negatively and significantly with sperm concentration. The ratio between bioactivity and immunoreactivity of FSH did not correlate with sperm density. Thus, the decrease in sperm concentration and other sperm variables resulting from a germinal epithelial dysfunction was not mediated or associated with low biological activity of FSH. The application of this method can be of clinical value in cases where a discrepancy is found between serum RIA-FSH levels and sperm quality.\r"

Venous blood samples were collected twice per week. Serum E2, P, and RU486 concentrations were determined by RIAs, and FSH and LH by immunofluorometric assays. Ultrasonography was used to measure the sizes of the follicles. Serum concentrations of FSH and LH were not suppressed during the treatment. Ovulation was apparently suppressed during RU486 treatment according to E2 and P concentrations and ultrasonography findings. During NET treatment, some evidence of ovulation and follicle growth were found during the first treatment periods. During the third treatment cycle, there was no evidence of ovulation (n = 2). Estradiol concentrations were sufficient to stimulate normal proliferative growth of the endometrium during the treatment. Control of bleeding was good. The exact mechanism of action of RU486 on steroid synthesis and ovulation is not clear, but it appears to act at the ovarian level. The evidence indicates that sequential RU486/progestin treatment could be developed to result in suppression of follicular growth and ovulation.\r"

  ".W": "The concept of pancreatic beta-cell mass is fundamental to the understanding of normal metabolism, the pathogenesis of diabetes, and the transplantation of beta-cell tissue. The amount of beta-cell tissue present in the pancreas is a major determinant of the quantity of insulin that can be secreted, and its mass will vary according to the size of the individual and the degree of insulin resistance present. Not all insulin-producing cells are the same, and the dimensions of this heterogeneity remain to be defined. Pancreatic beta-cell mass is markedly reduced in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and moderately reduced in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In both forms of diabetes, there are qualitative and quantitative abnormalities of insulin secretion that cannot be explained entirely by changes in beta-cell mass. The amount of beta-cell tissue needed for successful transplantation has only been partially defined. Segmental (approximately 50% of the pancreas) transplantation can normalize plasma glucose levels in humans. Difficulty obtaining sufficient amounts of beta-cell tissue is expected to remain a barrier to successful islet transplantation for the immediate future. More should be learned about the function and fate of grafted islet cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cytokine effects on permanent cell lines of transformed mouse pancreatic alpha- and beta-cells were compared. The beta-tumor cell 1 (beta TC1) line (from an adenoma created in transgenic mice expressing the SV40 large T-antigen oncogene under control of the rat insulin II promoter) produced insulin predominantly, although small quantities of intracellular glucagon (100:1 insulin to glucagon) were detectable by radioimmunoassay. The alpha TC1 line (from an adenoma created in transgenic mice expressing the SV40 large T-antigen oncogene under control of the rat preproglucagon promoter) produced not only glucagon but also considerable quantities of insulin (4:1 glucagon to insulin) and preproinsulin mRNA. We therefore cloned alpha TC1 cells and obtained 12 glucagon-producing clonal cell lines that did not produce levels of insulin detectable by radioimmunoassay. Analysis by Northern blotting of total RNA from two lines, alpha TC1 clones 6 and 9, confirmed the absence of preproinsulin mRNA. No somatostatin or pancreatic polypeptide was detected by immunohistochemical staining in alpha TC1 clones 6 or 9 or beta TC1 cells. Rat recombinant gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma; 5-250 U/ml) or mouse recombinant interleukin 1 (IL-1; 1-25 U/ml) individually inhibited DNA synthesis in beta TC1 cells after 3 days of treatment. The two cytokines in combination acted synergistically to further depress DNA synthesis and increase cytotoxicity. In contrast, alpha TC1 clone 9 cells were not sensitive to inhibition of DNA synthesis by each cytokine individually, although glucagon synthesis was inhibited. The combination of these cytokines caused marked inhibition of DNA and glucagon syntheses in alpha TC1 clone 9 cells. alpha TC1 clone 9 cells were somewhat more resistant to the cytotoxic action of the combined cytokines than were beta TC1 cells. Incubation with 50 U/ml IFN-gamma induced class II MHC molecules (I-Ab, I-Ad, and I-Ed) and enhanced the constitutive expression of class I molecules (H-2Kb and H-2Kd) on the cell surfaces of beta TC1, uncloned alpha TC1, and alpha TC1 clones 6 and 9. Thus, these cell lines are heterozygous for MHC alleles derived from both parental strains used in the construction of the transgenic mice [C57BL/6J (H-2b) and DBA/2J (H-2d)]. Class II gene transcription induced by IFN-gamma was confirmed in beta TC1 and alpha TC1 clone 9 cells by Northern blot analysis with A alpha-, A beta-, E alpha, and E beta-DNA probes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Functional changes in slow-twitch soleus and fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus muscles were assessed after 2 mo of streptozocin-induced diabetes in rats. For soleus, there was a slowing of twitch times both for contraction and relaxation and a reduction of maximum tetanic relaxation rate. There was little effect on strength performance assessed by maximal tetanic tension production. Treatment with the aldose reductase inhibitor ponalrestat largely prevented relaxation defects but had little effect on contraction. For the fast muscle, twitch times were relatively unaffected, but maximum tetanic relaxation rate was reduced. In addition, tetanic tension output decreased. These changes were largely prevented by ponalrestat treatment. The effects of partial insulin therapy were also investigated. This regimen reduced hypoinsulinemia, but sufficient hyperglycemia remained to stimulate the polyol pathway. It prevented the slowing of soleus twitch contraction but had no effect on relaxation. For extensor digitorum longus, insulin produced further deleterious effects on tetanic tension and maximum relaxation rate, which were antagonized by ponalrestat. A 1% dietary myo-inositol supplement had little effect on contractile function in slow or fast muscles. It was concluded that polyol-pathway activity is an important factor underlying skeletal muscle functional changes in diabetes, probably acting through disruption of Ca2+ handling. Hypoinsulinemia was considered a secondary factor causing atrophy, particularly of fast muscles. There was no evidence of effects dependent on neuropathy.\r"

STZ (55 mg/kg) or saline (1 ml/kg) was administered by intravenous injection 12 wk before the experimental studies. Tissue was sampled from four regions of the atrium, processed, and embedded in plastic. Quantitative stereological analysis indicated that in STZ-D rats, there was a significant diminution in size of the musculi pectinati (muscular ridges), which form a network making up the wall of the atrium. In addition, within the muscular ridges, there was a significant reduction in the relative proportion of cardiocytes within the cardiac tissue. The rest of the cardiac tissue consisted of interstitial regions, connective tissue, and blood vessels, which correspondingly increased. This suggests there was some form of cardiomyopathy. When atrial granularity was determined relative to cardiocyte volume density, a significant decrease (54%) was found in tissue from STZ-D rats. The blood pressure of conscious STZ-D rats was significantly lower than control rats, whereas right atrial pressure was not different. The level of resting plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in conscious STZ-D rats (98 +/- 5 pg/ml) was significantly higher than in control rats (52 +/- 7 pg/ml). The decreased atrial granularity could be related to the higher resting plasma ANF levels, suggesting a more rapid turnover or increased synthesis bypassing storage in the granular form.\r"

We report the first type I diabetic patient with an established kidney transplant on basal cyclosporin immunosuppression who was able to eliminate the insulin requirement after human islet transplantation into the portal vein. We successfully isolated approximately 800,000 islets that were 95% pure from 1.4 cadaver pancreases containing 121 U of insulin. Islets were proven viable by in vitro insulin response to glucose challenge. After 7 days of 24 degrees C culture, the islets were transplanted into the portal vein under local anesthesia. Seven days of Minnesota antilymphoblast globulin (20 mg/kg) administration followed the islet transplantation, with maintenance of the cyclosporin. Blood glucose was kept under strict control via intravenous insulin for 10 days posttransplantation, when all insulin therapy was stopped. Off insulin, the average 24-h blood glucose level remained less than 150 mg/dl, with the fasting glucose level at 115 +/- 6 mg/dl and the 2-h postprandial level at 141 +/- 8 mg/dl for 22 days posttransplantation (the time of this study). The C-peptide values post-Sustacal testing, although initially rising slower, exceeded the normal range, with peak values of 1.0-1.8 pmol/ml. This preliminary result represents the first essential step required to determine the feasibility of islet transplantation by future clinical trials.\r"

Normal body weight and urine volume were maintained during this period, and no cataracts were detected in the transplant recipients. In contrast, control rats receiving transplants of unencapsulated islets experienced normoglycemia for less than 2 wk. These results demonstrated that microencapsulation can protect allografted islets from both graft rejection and autoimmune destruction without immunosuppression in an animal model that mimics human insulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Bismuth subsalicylate was tested in an in vivo perfused rabbit model of oesophagitis for its ability to prevent the mucosal injury caused by pepsin. Treatment efficacy was assessed under both a treatment-before-injury protocol and a treatment-after-injury protocol. Oesophageal mucosal barrier function was evaluated by measuring flux rates of H+, K+, and glucose. The degree of oesophagitis was determined by gross and microscopic examination of the mucosa by several independent observers. Results showed that under both treatment protocols, bismuth subsalicylate significantly reduced the pepsin induced disruption of the mucosal barrier, as well as the morphologic changes. Bismuth subsalicylate when given after exposure to pepsin was also found to protect against the morphologic injury in a dose dependent manner. Experiments in vitro suggested that bismuth subsalicylate inhibits the proteolytic action of pepsin by interacting with pepsin, rather than with the pepsin substrate. We conclude that bismuth subsalicylate can protect the oesophageal mucosa against peptic injury, probably through inactivation of pepsin.\r"

  ".W": "K+ concentrations were measured in vitro with K+ sensitive microelectrodes in the microclimate at the luminal cell surface of the colon of guinea pigs. The serosal K+ concentration was mostly 5.4 mmol/1, the mucosal K+ concentrations were changed (0, 5, 50, or 70 mmol/l). Under control conditions K+ concentrations in the microclimate of the proximal colon were also low (6-9 mmol/l) and rather independent from K+ concentrations in the bulk luminal solution. In the distal colon K+ concentrations in the microclimate increased from 3.7 mmol/l when no K+ was in the luminal solution, up to 22 mmol/l when the mucosal K+ concentrations was 70 mmol/l. Attempts to decrease K+ conductance of the apical membrane with Ba++, to impair K+ transport with ouabain and to increase the paracellular shunt with deoxycholic acid did not affect K+ concentrations in the microclimate of the proximal colon but decreased K+ concentrations in the distal colon. When valinomycin or triaminopyrimidine were added to the mucosal solution at high K+ concentrations in the luminal solutions the K+ concentration in the microclimate was raised. At low luminal K+ concentrations valinomycin had no effect, triaminopyrimidine significantly diminished K+ concentrations at the cell surface. Regional differences in paracellular shunt conductance and in the preepithelial diffusion barrier are thought to be responsible for the observed differences between the proximal and the distal colon. Obviously, however, further unknown mechanisms have to be involved.\r"

We examined venous plasma concentrations of the known pruritogen, histamine, using a highly sensitive radioenzymatic assay in 42 patients with chronic cholestatic liver disease, and in normal controls. The mean plasma histamine level was significantly greater in chronic cholestatic liver disease patients (275 (117) pg/ml; X (SD) than in controls (140 (72) pg/ml, n = 20) (p less than 0.0001). No significant differences were found between histamine concentrations in the two chronic cholestatic liver disease subgroups: primary biliary cirrhosis and sclerosing cholangitis. Histamine concentrations were significantly greater (p less than 0.01) in the pruritic (319 (132) pg/ml) as compared with the non-pruritic (227 (75) pg/ml) chronic cholestatic liver disease patients. The histaminase activity was equivalent in patients and controls. The finding of raised histamine concentrations in chronic cholestatic liver disease suggests in vivo mast cell activation and a potential role for its mediators in the pruritus characteristic of these disorders.\r"

Basal and arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced PGE2 production by interstitial cells from salt-resistant rats was fourfold to fivefold higher than corresponding values of those from the salt-sensitive rats. Similarly, basal and AVP-responsive release of [3H]arachidonate were twofold higher by interstitial cells from salt-resistant compared with salt-sensitive rats. Differences in PGE2 production were abolished by the calcium inophore A23187 or the addition of exogenous arachidonate. The latter findings suggested a role for altered availability of endogenous arachidonate, possibly mediated by reduced calcium-responsive lipase activity. Basal and AVP-induced increases in cytosolic free calcium concentration, assessed by the aequorin method, were significantly lower in interstitial cells from salt-sensitive versus salt-resistant rats, further supporting a possible role for altered cellular calcium homeostasis. Studies of the potential contribution of various phospholipases and of triglyceride lipase to the release of arachidonate for PGE2 synthesis in interstitial cells implicated phospholipase A2 activity as a major pathway. When assessed in vitro in cell cytosolic fractions at identical calcium concentration, phospholipase A2 activity was lower in interstitial cells from salt-sensitive versus salt-resistant rats. Thus, both reduced cytosolic free calcium and phospholipase A2 activity of interstitial cells from salt-sensitive rats may contribute to the diminished capacity of these cells to liberate endogenous arachidonate for PGE2 synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The heart functions as an endocrine organ, releasing atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a hormone, in response to sodium and fluid overload. Specifically, ANP is released by cardiac myocytes in response to atrial distension. As a hormone, ANP has far-reaching multiorgan effects. The body systems affected include the cardiovascular, renal, neural, gastrointestinal, and endocrine systems. However, the main effects of this hormone are on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. ANP acts to oppose this system by causing vasorelaxation, blocking the secretion and sodium-retaining effects of aldosterone, and inhibiting renal renin secretion. ANP has many potential implications for clinical practice in both short-term and long-term care of patients with fluid and electrolyte balance. Clinicians may use methods to enhance or block endogenous ANP secretion based on assessment of clinical disorder, cause, status of homeostatic mechanisms, and implications for treatment. In addition, ANP may soon be administered pharmacologically, as well as monitored hematologically, in patients with fluid volume overload. In this article we describe the physiologic effects of ANP and address specific implications for clinical practice.\r"

Intracarotid infusion of adenosine (0.25 +/- 0.03 mg.min-1.kg-1) for 1 h to the fetus increased heart rate and hemoglobin concentration but did not significantly affect mean arterial pressure or blood gases. As with hypoxia, adenosine decreased the incidence of rapid eye movements by 55% and the incidence of breathing by 77% without significantly affecting the incidence of low-voltage electrocortical activity. However, with longer (9 h) administration, the incidence of breathing and eye movements returned to normal during the adenosine infusion. Intravenous infusion of theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, prevented most of the reduction in the incidence of breathing and eye movements normally seen during severe hypoxia (delta arterial PO2 = -10 Torr). It is concluded that 1) adenosine likely depresses fetal breathing and eye movements during hypoxia and 2) downregulation of adenosine receptors may contribute to the adaptation of breathing and eye movements during prolonged hypoxia.\r"

We studied the changes in response to hypocapnia with age in sheep, a species with collateral resistance (Rcoll) similar to those measured in humans. Measurements of Rcoll were made with either 5 or 10% CO2 and with air (hypocapnia) in 29 anesthetized sheep, ages 6 mo to 10 yr, with the wedged bronchoscope technique. Rcoll was 0.42 +/- 0.12, 0.58 +/- 0.18, 0.32 +/- 0.18, and 0.17 +/- 0.04 (SE) cmH2O.ml-1.min in 6-mo- and 1-, 2-, and 10-yr-old animals, respectively. These values were unchanged with hypocapnia. Despite the lack of a change in Rcoll with hypocapnia, administration of histamine aerosol (8 animals) through the bronchoscope increased Rcoll by 151 +/- 35% (P less than 0.05). These data suggest that although collateral pathways exist in sheep and are capable of constriction, they do not respond to hypocapnia. Furthermore, the response to hypocapnia is not influenced by age.\r"

After rats rested for 24 h and fasted overnight, glucose uptake was estimated by comparing steady-state serum glucose (SSSG) levels at low insulin (SSSI) concentrations achieved during an insulin suppression test. In the absence of added insulin, SSSI averaged approximately 20 microU/ml and glucose uptake was similar for high runners and younger weight-matched controls. However, with insulin added to sustain SSSI at approximately 35 microU/ml, SSSG was significantly reduced in all runners (P less than 0.02), with the lowest value attained in high runners. Fasting serum triglycerides were also reduced in all runners (P less than 0.05), with the lowest values seen in medium and high runners. The concentration of glycogen in liver and select skeletal muscles at the start of the study was not different between trained and control rats, suggesting that enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was not the result of lower glycogen levels. In addition, glycogen synthase and succinate dehydrogenase activities in biceps femoris muscle were only elevated for high runners, but glycogen synthase activity was not enhanced in plantaris muscle and was decreased in soleus muscle. These findings indicate that enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and reduced serum triglyceride concentrations induced in exercise-trained rats at varying activity levels are dissociated from changes in glycogen synthase and oxidative enzyme activity for skeletal muscle.\r"

A total of 48 guinea pigs weighing 293 +/- 7 g were employed in this study, which consisted of two phases. In phase 1, 35 anesthetized paralyzed animals were divided into five groups: group 1A, control (n = 6); group 1B, chronic dimethylthiourea (DMTU, n = 12); group 1C, acute DMTU (n = 6); group 1D, superoxide dismutase (n = 4); and group 1E, catalase (n = 7). All animals were injected with capsaicin (16 micrograms/kg iv), and changes in respiratory compliance and maximal expiratory flow rate were used as indicators of bronchoconstriction. The capsaicin injection caused a marked airway spasm that was significantly ameliorated by chronic DMTU pretreatment, but no amelioration was noted with the other treatments. An additional study for group 1C was performed using a double dose of DMTU. Again no amelioration was found. In phase 2, 13 animals were divided into two groups: group 2A, substance P (SP, n = 7) and group 2B, chronic DMTU + SP (n = 6). There was no significant difference in SP-induced bronchoconstriction between animals in these two groups. These data suggest that capsaicin-induced airway constriction is modulated by oxygen radicals which may augment mainly on the biosynthesis and/or axonal transport of tachykinins.\r"

The conditions were modest ischemic hypoxia (ischemia), hypoxia hypoxia (hypoxia), and free-flow normoxia (control). The major goal was to assess the effects of these perturbations on L during contractions. Ischemia and hypoxia were initiated just before the start of the contractions and at minute 7 of contractions in separate groups of experiments. Whenever applied, both ischemia and hypoxia reduced VO2 compared with the control values. When ischemia was initiated at the start of contractions, L was reduced transiently compared with the controls. When ischemia began at minute 7, L was increased modestly but transiently compared with the controls. When hypoxia was initiated at the start of contractions, L was increased during the entire period of contractions. The L pattern was the same as in the controls, rising to a maximal value at 3 min and declining steadily to a lower value at 30 min. When hypoxia began at minute 7, L declined initially at a slower rate than it did in the controls and was thereby elevated above the controls from 9 to 30 min. Ischemia was associated with a more rapid reduction in mechanical performance than hypoxia. The data suggest that the mechanisms of the decreased mechanical performance and VO2 are different for ischemia and hypoxia.\r"

During ventilation with CO-containing gases, cytochrome a,a3 absorption at 605 nm increased in the parietal cortex of anesthetized rats during carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) formation. HbCO levels, measured by changes in absorption at 569-586 nm in vivo, correlated positively with arterial HbCO by CO oximetry. Arterial blood pressure and calculated O2 content varied inversely with HbCO. During CO exposure, decreases in blood pressure, O2 content, and cytochrome a,a3 oxidation level could be reversed partly at constant HbCO by compression to 3 atmospheres absolute (ATA). After removing CO from inspired gas at 3 ATA, optical and physiological parameters recovered completely to control values except for minor persistent elevations of HbCO. Difference spectra from parallel experiments at constant HbCO revealed absorption minima at 588-592 nm and 600-605 nm as a result of hyperbaric exposure. Spectral analysis of these components was consistent with partial dissociation of a cytochrome a3-CO complex and cytochrome a reoxidation with increasing dissolved O2 in hyperbaric conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of endothelium-dependent vasodilation on pulmonary vascular hemodynamics were evaluated in a variety of in vivo and in vitro models to determine 1) the comparability of the hemodynamic effects of acetylcholine (ACh), bradykinin (BK), nitric oxide (NO), and 8-bromo-guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), 2) whether methylene blue is a useful inhibitor of endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) activity in vivo, and 3) the effect of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension on the responsiveness of the pulmonary vasculature to ACh. In isolated rat lungs, which were preconstricted with hypoxia, ACh, BK, NO, and 8-bromo-cGMP caused pulmonary vasodilation, which was not inhibited by maximum tolerable doses of methylene blue. Methylene blue did not inhibit EDRF activity in any model, despite causing increased pulmonary vascular tone and responsiveness to various constrictor agents. There were significant differences in the hemodynamic characteristics of ACh, BK, and NO. In the isolated lung, BK and NO caused transient decreases of hypoxic vasoconstriction, whereas ACh caused more prolonged vasodilation. Pretreatment of these lungs with NO did not significantly inhibit ACh-induced vasodilation but caused BK to produce vasoconstriction. Tachyphylaxis, which was agonist specific, developed with repeated administration of ACh or BK but not NO. Tachyphylaxis probably resulted from inhibition of the endothelium-dependent vasodilation pathway proximal to NO synthesis, because it could be overcome by exogenous NO. Pretreatment with 8-bromo-cGMP decreased hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and, even when the hypoxic pressor response had largely recovered, subsequent doses of ACh and NO failed to cause vasodilation, although BK produced vasoconstriction. These findings are compatible with the existence of feedback inhibition of the endothelium-dependent relaxation by elevation of cGMP levels. Responsiveness to ACh was retained in lungs with severe monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. Many of these findings would not have been predicted based on in vitro studies and illustrate the importance for expanding studies of EDRF to in vivo and ex vivo models.\r"

  ".W": "A method for assay of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase (24-hydroxylase) activity in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes was applied to determine whether vitamin D-dependent rickets type II (VDDR II) is hereditary. In normal lymphocytes incubated with PHA for 3 days, maximal and half-maximal responses of 24-hydroxylase were observed after exposure to 10(-8) mol/L and (1.3 +/- 0.4) x 10(-9) mol/L 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], respectively. These responses were similar to those of cultured skin fibroblasts. In contrast, after exposure to 10(-8), 10(-7), and 10(-6) mol/L 1,25-(OH)2D3, no 24-hydroxylase activity was detected in cells from patients with VDDR II, and intermediate activity was observed in cells from their parents. These findings indicated the presence of an intracellular receptor-effector system for 1,25-(OH)2D3 in peripheral lymphocytes. Heterozygotes of VDDR II could be identified, and autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease was demonstrated. Detection of heterozygotes of this disease was not possible by assay of inhibition of thymidine incorporation, another marker of the function of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes. Therefore, assay of 24-hydroxylase induction reflected the receptor status more closely than assay of inhibition of DNA biosynthesis. The assay of 24-hydroxylase activity in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes described here will be useful for diagnosis of VDDR II and study of families of patients with this disease.\r"

  ".U": "90203136\r", 
  ".W": "The microheterogeneity and bioassayable activity of serum FSH (B-FSH) can be regulated by exogenous GnRH in boys with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and by estrogen in a women with gonadal dysgenesis, presumably via hormonally mediated changes in the degree of FSH glycosylation. To test the hypothesis that testosterone (T) regulates the circulating forms of B-FSH, we raised the serum T levels of early pubertal boys to adult levels. In this model, high dose T inhibits the pubertal nocturnal augmentation of LH secretion, apparently through decreased GnRH secretion. This model allowed us to test a second hypothesis, that B-FSH is a sensitive indicator of hypothalamic GnRH release. The boys were studied on two consecutive weekends, during which they received either saline (S) or T infusions. Beginning at noon on the study day, after an overnight acclimatization, the boys received either S or T at 33% or 100% of the adult male production rate. Blood was sampled from 2000-0800 at 10-min intervals for immunoactive LH and FSH (I-FSH) and for B-FSH, as determined by the in vitro Sertoli cell aromatase induction assay, and at 30-min intervals for T. Gonadotropin levels were analyzed as mean hourly or 3-h concentrations and as pulse profiles by two established objective peak detection programs, Cluster and Detect. During S treatment, mean LH increased after the onset of sleep (P = 0.0006) and, after plateauing for several hours, declined to baseline in the early morning hours. Mean levels of B-FSH were also minimally (but significantly) increased after the onset of sleep (P = 0.046) and paralleled the decline noted for LH. Mean levels of I-FSH did not demonstrate a diurnal rhythm. The effect of T was gonadotropin specific. High dose T abolished the nocturnal elevation in mean LH concentrations, but had no effect on the nocturnal elevation of B-FSH (P less than 0.05) or on I-FSH levels. The LH pulse frequency was greatest from 2300-0450 h, during S treatment (P = 0.016). The pulse frequency of B-FSH was also minimally increased after the onset of sleep (P = 0.045). The T infusion abolished the nocturnal increase in LH pulse frequency, without an effect on B-FSH pulse frequency. B-FSH pulse frequency exceeded LH pulse frequency during S treatment (8.0 +/- 0.7 pulses/12 h vs. 5.5 +/- 0.4), and B-FSH pulses persisted throughout the night. The pulse amplitudes of LH and B-FSH were not affected by T.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90203138\r", 
  ".W": "Ten hirsute women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCO) and nine with idiopathic hirsutism (IH) underwent selective ovarian suppression with leuprolide for 5-6 months and then were randomized to receive, in addition, dexamethasone or placebo for 4 more months. Serum hormone levels and hair growth rates were determined before and after each treatment period. During the initial treatment period with leuprolide alone, testosterone decreased by 54 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) in PCO and by 36 +/- 3% in IH (P = 0.02). Androstenedione decreased by 53 +/- 6% in PCO and by 31 +/- 7% in IH (P = 0.02). Androstanediol glucuronide (Adiol-G) decreased by 14 +/- 6% in PCO and by 7 +/- 3% in IH. There was no change in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). While initial serum androgen levels were higher in PCO than in IH, they were similar after ovarian suppression in the two groups. After ovarian suppression, Adiol-G was more consistently correlated with testosterone and androstenedione than was DHEAS, suggesting that Adiol-G may be a better marker than DHEAS of adrenal androgen secretion. Hair growth rates decreased by 37 +/- 6% in PCO and by 14 +/- 10% in IH (P = 0.07). The change in hair growth correlated with the change in androstenedione (r = 0.66; P = 0.002), but not significantly with the change in testosterone (r = 0.29; P = 0.2). After the addition of dexamethasone therapy (0.5 mg daily), testosterone, androstenedione, and DHEAS levels fell to near or below assay detection limits, while Adiol-G decreased by 80 +/- 3%. Hair growth rates decreased slightly more in women during dexamethasone (46 +/- 6%) than during placebo (26 +/- 9%; P = 0.18). In summary, the ovary was the major source of circulating testosterone and androstenedione in PCO. The adrenal contributed a substantial minority of these hormones in PCO and was the major source of androgen secretion in IH. Adrenal hyperandrogenism was common in both IH and PCO. Hair growth rates correlated best with changes in serum androstenedione levels. Adiol-G, which was derived primarily from adrenal precursors, was a better marker of adrenal androgen secretion than was DHEAS in these subjects.\r"

  ".W": "In 1986 it was reported that a high percentage of women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) were found to have thyroid hypofunction (TH), mostly subclinical hypothyroidism, as defined by an augmented response of TSH to TRH, and that all affected women had complete relief of PMS symptoms with L-T4 therapy. We studied baseline thyroid function (T4, T3 uptake, T3, TSH, and TSH response to TRH) in 15 normal women (group 1) and 44 women with PMS and treated 22 of the PMS women with L-T4 (group 2; 1.6 micrograms L-T4/kg dose) and the other half with placebo (group 3) for 2 months in a double blinded protocol. We found no evidence of thyroid dysfunction in group 2 or 3, except for 1 subject with slightly elevated TSH (6.2 microIU/mL) and moderate augmented response to TRH (change in TSH, 65 microIU/mL). During the treatment phase we found a complete relief of symptoms in 6 (27%), a partial relief of symptoms in 6 (27%), and some relief of symptoms in 12 (54%) in group 2. Whereas in group 3, 10 (45%) had complete relief, 5 (23%) had partial relief, and 15 (68%) had some relief of symptoms. These results show that 1) there is no significant thyroid disease in PMS; and 2) L-T4 is no better than placebo in treatment of PMS. We conclude that the high incidence of thyroid hypofunction previously reported in PMS is due to an unusually low TSH level for the limit of the normal range for the TRH stimulation test.\r"

Results from part 1 showed a significant reduction in dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at all doses and a significant increase in both testosterone (T) and delta 4-androstenedione at the 50- and 100-mg doses. No change was seen in LH, FSH, cortisol, or estradiol levels. Serum lipids, including total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, and triglycerides were not affected by treatment. Results from part 2 again showed significant reduction in DHT at all doses. DHT levels returned to pretreatment values within 14 days of discontinuing treatment. Significant increases in T were observed only in the 1.0 mg group and only during the first 8 days of treatment. The T/DHT ratio increased with all doses and returned to baseline when drug was discontinued. The DHT metabolites and androstanediol glucuronide and androsterone glucuronide were significantly reduced at all doses. There were no significant adverse experiences reported during part 1 or 2. In conclusion, finasteride is well tolerated by normal volunteers and results in significant suppression of serum DHT at all doses tested.\r"

Ten normal subjects and 11 hyperthyroid patients were studied after an overnight fast (12-14 h) and for 3 h after ingestion of 75 g glucose. Peripheral glucose metabolism was analyzed by the forearm technique to estimate muscle exchange of substrate combined with indirect calorimetry. Increased forearm glucose uptake was observed in the hyperthyroid patients compared to that in the normal subjects (1286 +/- 212 vs. 677 +/- 88 mumol/100 mL forearm.3 h) with enhanced glucose oxidation (443 +/- 40 vs. 147 +/- 29 mumol/100 mL forearm.3 h). Nonoxidative glucose metabolism was also greater in hyperthyroid patients than in normal subjects (842 +/- 234 vs. 529 +/- 90 mumol/100 mL forearm.3 h). Basal serum FFA levels were significantly higher in hyperthyroid than in normal subjects (0.252 +/- 0.025 vs. 0.182 +/- 0.022 g/L), as were the basal lipid oxidation rates in the forearm muscles of the thyrotoxic individuals (0.290 +/- 0.066 vs. 0.088 +/- 0.016 mg/100 mL forearm.min). After glucose ingestion, serum FFA levels and lipid oxidation rates declined significantly to equivalent values in both groups of subjects, and the similar basal insulin concentrations increased to significantly higher levels in the hyperthyroid patients. In conclusion, spontaneous human hyperthyroidism increases glucose uptake by the forearm muscles in the postabsorptive state and during an oral glucose challenge, with augmented fluxes of glucose through the oxidative and nonoxidative pathways.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to assess the effects of the products of the lipoxygenase pathway on steroidogenesis and the production of prostaglandins (PGs) by human corpora lutea in the midluteal phase. In the first experiment luteal cells were cultured with 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) at 10, 100, 500, or 1000 ng/mL in the presence or absence of hCG at 100 ng/mL for 10 days. The addition of 5-HETE dose-dependently inhibited progesterone (P) production by the cultural luteal cells. P production stimulated by exposure to hCG was also reduced significantly in response to 5-HETE. However, 5-HETE had no effect on the production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGF2 alpha, or PGE2 by cultured luteal cells at any point during the culture period. In the second experiment the reaction products of soybean lipoxidase of arachidonic acid (AA-LIP) were added to cultured luteal cells. Treatment with either AA or LIP alone had no effect on basal P production. The addition of AA-LIP at all concentrations tested reduced P production by cultured luteal cells in the presence or absence of hCG. AA-LIP significantly reduced basal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha secretion in cultured luteal cells on day 2. Although the stimulatory effect of AA on luteal PGE2 production was maintained throughout the entire culture period, the lipoxygenase products of AA did not affect AA-stimulated PGE2 production by cultured luteal cell. These results suggest that the products of the lipoxygenase pathway may be important in the involution of human corpora lutea.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this work was to examine the effects of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) on estradiol (E2) production by granulosa cells obtained from ovaries of patients with polycystic ovary disease (PCO). Granulosa cells, isolated from ovaries of three PCO patients, were cultured in serum-free medium containing either androstenedione alone (10(-7) M) or androstenedione plus graded doses of FSH, IGF-I, IGF-II, and/or insulin. At the end of the culture period (2, 4, or 6 days) E2 levels in the medium were measured by RIA. The results from each patient were similar, and therefore, the data were pooled. In the 6-day time-course experiments, the control (untreated) cells produced relatively high levels of E2 at 2 days; however, none was detected thereafter. Treatment with FSH (30 ng/mL) stimulated E2 production 4-fold at 2 days, but the stimulatory effects of FSH were not sustained during culture. IGF-I at 30 ng/mL mimicked the effects of FSH. Concomitant treatment with FSH and IGF-I caused synergistic increases in E2 production (3-, 13-, and 33-fold at 2, 4, and 6 days, respectively). Dose-response studies revealed that FSH and IGF-I stimulated E2 production in a dose-dependent fashion (ED50 of FSH and IGF-I, were 1.1 +/- 0.3 and 7.6 +/- 7.2 ng/mL, respectively). In the presence of a maximally effective dose of FSH (30 ng/mL), the cells appeared to become more responsive to IGF-I (ED50 of IGF-I plus FSH, 1.09 +/- 0.29 ng/mL); however, this effect was not significant (P = 0.086). In the presence of a maximally effective dose of IGF-I (30 ng/mL), the stimulatory effect of FSH on E2 production was dramatically amplified, but the IGF-I did not significantly (P = 0.85) change the potency of FSH (ED50 of FSH plus IGF-I, 1.07 +/- 2.3 ng/mL). Treatment with IGF-II over the concentration range of 0.1-100 ng/mL had no effect on either control or FSH-stimulated E2 production. Treatment with insulin, either alone or together with FSH, increased the levels of E2, but the insulin effects were seen only at the highest doses tested (0.3-10 micrograms/mL). The results in these in vitro experiments with PCO granulosa cells indicate that 1) physiological concentrations of IGF-I are as effective as FSH in stimulating E2 production; 2) IGF-I and FSH act synergistically to control the level of E2 production; and 3) this synergy was not observed with insulin or IGF-II.\r"

Blood was sampled and infusions given via chronic jugular catheters, extended via a swivel into the adjacent room. In the rhesus monkeys, the mean plasma GH concentration rose during insulin-induced hypoglycemia from 4.7 +/- 1.9 to 17.4 +/- 2.5 micrograms/L at 60 min (P less than 0.001), and the mean plasma cortisol concentration from 320 +/- 55 to 700 +/- 133 nmol/L at 90 min (P less than 0.001). The mean plasma PRL concentration (basal value, 5 +/- 2.3 micrograms/L) did not change significantly. During glucose-induced hyperglycemia, the mean plasma GH concentration oscillated between 2.0-5.2 micrograms/L from 60-360 min (no significant change). Large GH secretory episodes occurred during hyperglycemia in individual animals. During nicotinic acid-induced plasma FFA suppression, the mean plasma GH concentration increased from 3.7 +/- 0.6 to 17.9 +/- 2.3 micrograms/L at 270 min (P less than 0.001). During lipid-induced plasma FFA elevation, the mean plasma GH concentration decreased consistently from 6.5 +/- 1.0 micrograms/L to values between 1.3 +/- 0.2 and 2.6 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L from 60-360 min (P less than 0.01). Plasma PRL and cortisol concentrations were not affected by plasma FFA changes. Compared with the spontaneous plasma GH pattern in a previously studied group of rhesus monkeys, the mean plasma GH concentration was increased during hypoglycemia and plasma FFA suppression. It was strongly suppressed during plasma FFA elevation and slightly suppressed during hyperglycemia. Similar effects were observed in the Java monkeys, although hyperglycemia tests were not performed. We conclude the following. 1) In rhesus and Java monkeys, as in man, GH secretion is stimulated by plasma FFA suppression and is inhibited by plasma FFA elevation. In both species, acute hypoglycemia stimulates the secretion of GH and cortisol. 2) These nonhuman primates differ from man in that hyperglycemia only weakly inhibits GH secretion in the rhesus monkey, if at all (Java monkeys had no hyperglycemia tests), and in neither species does acute hypoglycemia stimulate the secretion of PRL. 3) Both primate species can serve as models for the metabolic modulation of GH secretion in man, although a suppressive effect of hyperglycemia remains to be proven.\r"

  ".W": "The acute GH release stimulated by the synthetic hexapeptide, His-DTrp-Ala-Trp-DPhe-Lys-NH2 [GH releasing peptide (GHRP)], was determined in 18 normal men and compared with the effects of GH-releasing hormone, GHRH-(1-44)-NH2. Specificity of effect was assessed by measurement of serum PRL, LH, TSH, and cortisol. GHRP was administered at doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 microgram/kg by iv bolus. GHRH at a dose of 1.0 microgram/kg was administered alone and together with various does of GHRP. No adverse clinical effects of laboratory abnormalities were observed in response to GHRP. A side-effect of mild facial flushing of 1- to 3-min duration occurred in 16 of the 18 subjects who received GHRH-(1-44)-NH2. Mean (+/- SEM) peak serum GH levels after injection of placebo and 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 microgram/kg GHRP were 1.2 +/- 0.3, 7.6 +/- 2.5, 16.5 +/- 4.1, and 68.7 +/- 15.5 micrograms/L, respectively. The submaximal dosages of 0.1 and 0.3 microgram/kg GHRP plus 1 microgram/kg GHRH stimulated GH release synergistically. Serum PRL and cortisol levels rose about 2-fold above basal levels only at the 1 microgram/kg dose of GHRP, and there were no changes in serum LH and TSH over the first hour after administration of the peptide(s). GHRP is a potent secretagogue of GH in normal men. Since GHRP and GHRH together stimulate GH release synergistically, these results suggest that GHRP and GHRH act independently. This supports our hypothesis that the GH-releasing activity of GHRP reflects a new physiological system in need of further characterization in animals and man.\r"

  ".W": "CRH, GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), somatostatin (SRIH), and peptide histidine methionine (PHM) were measured by RIA in extracts of normal adrenal glands and in extracts from adrenal and extraadrenal pheochromocytomas. In normal adrenal glands, immunoreactive (IR) CRH, IR-SRIH, and IR-PHM were detectable, while IR-GHRH was undetectable. In all 11 cases of adrenal pheochromocytomas, the tumors contained 2 or more of these four IR-peptides. In particular, IR-CRH was found in 73% (n = 8) of adrenal pheochromocytomas, IR-GHRH in 91% (n = 10), IR-SRIH in 91% (n = 10), and IR-PHM in 82% (n = 9) of adrenal pheochromocytomas. There was no significant correlation among the concentration of these peptides in each tumor, i.e. the concentrations of the IR-peptides were independent of each other. In contrast to the adrenal pheochromocytomas, none of these 4 IR-peptides was detectable in 5 extraadrenal pheochromocytomas. Gel filtration of pooled extracts from adrenal pheochromocytomas showed that the major component of the IR-CRH, IR-GHRH, IR-SRIH, and IR-PHM eluted in the position of their synthetic counterparts. Our results suggest that 1) the normal adrenal gland contains IR-CRH, IR-SRIH, and IR-PHM, but not IR-GHRH; 2) all of the adrenal pheochromocytomas we examined contained a number of hypothalamic releasing or inhibiting hormones; 3) their tissue concentrations were independent of each other; and 4) all of the extraadrenal pheochromocytomas we examined contained no such IR-peptides. The presence of hypothalamic hormones in adrenal pheochromocytomas and their absence in extraadrenal pheochromocytomas may be due to the differences in the chromaffin cells of their origin. Our data may be helpful in the differential diagnosis between adrenal and extraadrenal pheochromocytomas.\r"

In contrast, treatment with ionomycin which increases cytosolic Ca2+ has no effect on basal IP3 production but enhances the response to EGF. Activation of protein kinase C inhibits IP3 production in response to either EGF or AIF4-. These studies demonstrate the occurrence of EGF-stimulated phospholipase C activity in the rat inner medullary collecting duct.

The monoclonal antibody (MAb) WP1, which inhibits bilirubin and phenol-glucuronidating activity, was used to immunopurify UDPGTs from human liver. Purified UDPGTs were injected into mice to obtain new MAbs. Immunoblotting of microsomes with MAb HEB7 revealed at least three polypeptides in liver (56, 54, and 53 kD) and one in kidney (54 kD). In liver microsomes from four patients (A, B, C, and D) with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I (CN type I), UDPGT activity towards bilirubin was undetectable (A, B, C, and D) and activity towards phenolic compounds and 5-hydroxytryptamine either reduced (A and B) or normal (C and D). UDPGT activity toward steroids was normal. Immunoblot studies revealed that the monoclonal antibody WP1 recognized two polypeptides (56 and 54 kD) in liver microsomes from patient A and none in patient B. With HEB7 no immunoreactive polypeptides were seen in these two patients. Patient C showed a normal banding pattern and in patient D only the 53-kD band showed decreased intensity. These findings suggest considerable heterogeneity with regard to the expression of UDPGT isoenzymes among CN type I patients.\r"

The phosphodiesterase inhibitor markedly potentiated the effect of low-dose AP infusions on urinary sodium and cyclic GMP excretion without potentiating the fall in blood pressure. Acute volume expansion (1% body wt) led to small but significant (P less than 0.01) rises in plasma AP and urinary cyclic GMP levels. Pretreatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor enhanced the natriuretic and cyclic GMP response to volume loading, an effect that was attenuated by administration of a monoclonal antibody directed against AP. These data indicate that cyclic GMP mediates the natriuretic activity of AP and AP and cyclic GMP play active roles in the natriuresis of acute volume expansion. Moreover, pharmacological manipulation of cyclic GMP levels may prove a useful therapeutic strategy for facilitating the natriuretic but not the hypotensive effects of AP.\r"

Several sera gave positive particle agglutination titres, however, while being negative by the two other assays, and the Serodia Myco II test may not be as specific for detecting M pneumoniae IgM as the other two tests. While the Serodia Myco II test may be a good screening assay, it is unlikely to be a definitive test for M pneumoniae IgM, but may be better than the complement fixation test, particularly in younger patients in whom M pneumoniae IgM is found more frequently.\r"

Furthermore, studies of responses of these cells to various mitogenic stimuli have demonstrated significant defects in the ability of these cells to proliferate in culture. We report here on the cloning and maintenance in long term culture of T cells from an athymic mouse stimulated in vitro with allogeneic spleen cells. Of 10 Thy-1+ clones, 7 CD4+CD8- and 3 CD4-CD8+ Ag-specific cells were obtained. Among the CD4+ T cells, we observed a variety of specificities, including an autoreactive I-Aq specific clone, a minor lymphocyte stimulating determinant (Mls)-reactive clone, and five allo-I-Ad-specific CD4+ clones; a class II-specific CD4-CD8+ clone was also obtained. In addition, we observed two Thy-1-CD3+ clones (one of which is also CD4+ and expresses V beta 8) which are constitutively responsive to the lymphokines IL-2 and IL-4. Of 11 clones tested, 7 produce IL-2 and/or IL-4 lymphokines after stimulation through the TCR, whereas 4 do not, requiring exogenous lymphokines for optimal responses to Ag. Of 10 clones tested for IL-2R expression, 3 had notably low levels, correlating with low proliferative responses to IL-2. The results reveal the spectrum of T cells available to a mouse which is congenitally athymic and describe the heterogeneity of immune defects expressed in such cells at the clonal level.\r"

In addition, different toxins have different specificities for V beta.\r"

As a result of the recent demonstration that the allospecific Th cell response of human PBL can be generated by three distinct pathways of Th cell and APC interactions, we investigated the sensitivity of these three Th-APC pathways, as well as the Th response to recall Ag, to different concentrations of CsA. PBL from healthy volunteer donors were set up as primary in vitro cultures either without antigenic stimulation, or with influenza A virus, tetanus toxoid, or HLA alloantigenic (ALLO) stimulation. Ag-stimulated IL-2 production and proliferation were measured to assess Th cell function. To study the effect of CsA on Th function, different concentrations of CsA (0.001 to 0.1 micrograms/ml final) were added to the cultures at the time of stimulation. Th responses to influenza A virus and tetanus toxoid were more sensitive to CsA than the Th response to ALLO. By selective depletion of either responder or stimulator APC and/or of CD4+ or CD8+ cells, we 1) verified that the human ALLO Th response can be mediated by three distinct Th-APC pathways; 2) demonstrated that the ALLO response mediated by CD4+ Th and self-APC (the same helper pathway used by recall Ag) is as sensitive to CsA as the responses to recall Ag; and 3) showed that there is a hierarchy of sensitivity of these three allospecific pathways. The results are discussed with respect to the potential significance of the differential sensitivity of these allospecific Th-APC pathways to CsA for prevention of tissue allograft rejection.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of the capacity of splenocytes from non-prototypic Mlsa or Mlsc mouse strains to stimulate allogeneic H-2k-compatible T cells in a primary Mls-defined MLR provided interesting examples of exceptions to the usually stated characterization of Mlsa and Mlsc determinants as highly stimulatory of weakly stimulatory, respectively. Across the Mlsa barrier, MA/My stimulator cells had a significantly reduced capacity to elicit responder proliferation in comparison with prototypic AKR/J or less well studied C58/J, CE/J, or RF/J splenocytes. Across the Mlsc barrier, a gradient of stimulatory ability was observed with RF/J splenocytes being virtually nonstimulatory, prototypic C3H/HeJ splenocytes having an intermediate capacity, and CE/J and C58/J being highly stimulatory presenters of this non-MHC specificity. The differing capacity of each of these H-2k stimulator cells to elicit unprimed responder cell proliferation across an Mlsa or Mlsc difference correlated with the T cell growth factor activity that was secreted into the MLR supernatants. The super stimulatory form of Mlsc was expressed in an autosomal dominant fashion by (Mlsc poorly stimulatory x Mlsc super-stimulatory)F1 animals, (BALB.K x C58/J)F1 or (RF/J x CE/J)F1. The segregation of Mlsc stimulatory ability among first backcross and F2 animals derived from the former F1 was compatible with a single non-MHC gene controlling the expression and presentation of the super-stimulatory form of Mlsc. The regulatory nature of this gene was indicated by the observation that F1 animals generated from the Mlsc nonprototypic and poorly stimulatory BALB/c parental strain were self-tolerant to the super-stimulatory form of Mlsc. The existence of an Mls specificity other than a and c was suggested by positive non-MHC MLR responses in certain responder/stimulator cell combinations of Mls prototypic and nonprototypic mouse strains.\r"

IL-2 production and proliferative responses to conventional Ag, such as influenza or tetanus, are exclusively dependent on the presence of CD4+ T cells and AC. In contrast, IL-2 and proliferative responses to alloantigen can be mediated by either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cells respond to alloantigen using either autologous AC (self-restricted), or allogeneic AC (allo-restricted), whereas CD8+ T cells respond to alloantigen using allogeneic AC only. The understanding of Th cell-AC interactions involved in in vitro allogeneic responses will be important for delineating the Th cell-AC interactions involved in transplantation immunity as well as in clinical disorders characterized by T cell dysfunction such as human immunodeficiency virus infection and systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

NZB mice also produce autoantibodies but these tend to be of the IgM H chain class. This work examines whether differences in the isotype of autoantibody produced by lupus-prone mice reflects differences in the sensitivity of autoreactive B cells to lymphokine-mediated IgG secretion. Twenty-five percent of normal BALB/c B cells produced IgG1 when stimulated in vitro with IL-4 plus LPS. This was comparable with the effect of IL-4 on small resting B cells from MRL-lpr/lpr and NZB/W mice. In contrast, less than 8% of the resting B cells from NZB mice produced IgG1 under these conditions. LPS plus IFN-gamma induced 5% of BALB/c and NZB/W but only 1% of NZB B cells to secrete IgG2a. Because lymphocytes from both young and old NZB mice showed diminished IgG1 and IgG2a secretion after lymphokine treatment, B cells from this strain appeared to be intrinsically resistant to the effects of IL-4 and IFN-gamma. In contrast, a disproportionately large proportion (22%) of B cells from adult MRL-lpr/lpr mice produced IgG2a when treated with IFN-gamma in vitro. Only B cells from MRL-lpr/lpr mice with active disease responded with such high levels of IgG2a production: cells from animals that had not yet developed clinical disease produced normal levels of IgG2a. Within each strain, B cells producing antibodies against autoantigens such as DNA, bromelain-treated mouse RBC and Sm responded to treatment with IL-4 and IFN-gamma in a manner indistinguishable from B cells producing antibodies against conventional Ag such as TNP and ARS.\r"

After stimulation with liposome-conjugates of ENVP346 or ENVP466 and soluble rIL-2, however, CD4 lymphocytes from some HIV Ab+ individuals were able to proliferate. Significantly higher frequencies of rIL-2-augmented proliferative responses to liposome-conjugated ENVP346 or ENVP466 were observed in HIV Ab+ asymptomatic individuals as compared to patients with AIDS-related conditions or AIDS.

In the present study, we have investigated the percentage of HML-1-positive cells in the human intestinal lamina propria and the coexpression of HML-1 with different T cell subset markers. In addition, we studied the inducibility of HML-1 on PBL which normally are HML-1-negative. Flow cytometric analysis of isolated intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) showed that about 40% of the cells expressed HML-1, the majority belonging to the CD8-positive subpopulation. Virtually all LPL expressed CD45RO, whereas the percentage of CD29-positive cells was only about 50%, similar to PBL. There were only few cells expressing CD45RA or Leu-8 in the lamina propria. HML-1-positive cells were almost exclusively CD45RA-negative, but were found in both the CD29-positive and the CD29-negative subpopulation of LPL. In vitro stimulation of PBL showed that the expression of HML-1 was inducible on T cells by mitogens, phorbolester, Ag, and rIL-2. Expression of HML-1 was induced with a different time course and with differences in the response to the investigated stimuli compared with CD25. Activated HML-1-positive PBL were also predominantly CD45RA-negative. The findings show that HML-1 is an Ag, which is expressed in vivo on a specific subset of previously activated T cells in the unique environment of the intestinal mucosa, and which can be induced in vitro by different activation signals on PBL.\r"

Like ELAM-1, the 1.4C3 Ag was minimally expressed on resting EC, whereas ICAM-1 was moderately expressed. After stimulation with IL-1, TNF, or LPS, ELAM-1 expression was maximal after 4 to 6 h, 1.4C3 Ag after 6 to 10 h, and ICAM-1 after 10 to 24 h. The duration of 1.4C3 expression was intermediate between ELAM-1 and ICAM-1, and was more prolonged in response to TNF than IL-1 or LPS. Whereas the expression of the three Ag showed a similar dose response to varying concentrations of IL-1 or LPS, EC required a 10-fold higher concentration of TNF for half maximal expression of ELAM-1 than for half maximal expression of 1.4C3 Ag or ICAM-1 (5 ng/ml compared to 0.5 ng/ml). Of the three Ag, only ICAM-1 was enhanced by IFN-gamma. SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions showed the 1.4C3 Ag to migrate as a single band with a relative molecular mass of approximately 95 kDa. mAb 1.4C3 adds to our understanding of the kinetics of the EC response to different cytokines and will be useful in studying the regulation of EC activation. Furthermore, the 1.4C3 molecule may have an important role in leukocyte-EC interactions.\r"

However, if APC were activated before fixation, they could be ECDI-fixed and retain the ability to induce T cell proliferation. IL-1, IL-4 or LPS were capable of activating APC in this way, whereas IFN-gamma was not. This activation step occurred in 6 h, required protein synthesis, and was distinct from increases in Ia or IL-1. This suggests resting APC lack structures that are essential for inducing T cell proliferation.\r"

The purified radiolabeled protein was analyzed in SDS-PAGE and a single band with a molecular mass of 43 kDa was revealed. The iodinated material was then tested in a radioreceptor assay using the M1 cell line as a second target cell line. The binding of the natural 125I hormone was abrogated in a dose dependent and specific fashion by either natural and rHILDA. The limit of signal detection of displacement for the radiolabeled ligand by unlabeled sample was found to be 0.05 ng/ml. The proliferative DA1.a assay and the M1 radioreceptor assay were used to analyze the HILDA content of 17 human tumor cell line culture supernatants, and 12 among them were spontaneously secreting a detectable level of LIF. The secreted amount of HILDA was largely enhanced by treating the cell line with 30 to 80 nM PMA; in these conditions a 10 to 20x increase in the detected amount was observed. The specificity of the detected signal was reinforced by analyzing the mRNA expression of HILDA in the tumor cell lines. The secreting cell lines were found to express various forms of LIF transcripts with a major specie at 3.8 kb.\r"

These analyses revealed that a wide range of different V regions are capable of binding with the same decapeptide epitope, and that these antibody sequence differences generally coincided with different binding fine specificities.

Inhibition studies using synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 1-15 of the monoclonal Ig used to produce the poly- and monoclonal reagents provide evidence that the epitopes are predominantly, if not exclusively, specific for the N-terminal strand of the domain. Examination of known x-ray structures of mouse VH suggests that the primary difference between the two epitopes in the N-terminal strands is determined by the peptide chain structure due to Pro at position 9.

Recent cDNA and genomic cloning studies have demonstrated that, in contrast to other FcR, Fc epsilon RII is not a member of the Ig gene superfamily. Moreover, it uniquely expresses a region that is highly homologous with a membrane-associated, calcium-dependent binding lectin, the asialoglycoprotein receptor. We now report that the interaction between IgE and the Fc epsilon RII of murine B cells and macrophages requires calcium. Furthermore, as might be expected of asialoglycoprotein lectins, this binding was pH-dependent and resulted in ligand internalization. However, although 125I-Fc epsilon RII bound in a calcium-dependent manner to monosaccharide-agarose beads, high concentrations of mono- and disaccharides did not inhibit the interaction between either 125I-IgE and intact B cells or 125I-Fc epsilon RII (from surface-labeled B cells) and IgE-Sepharose. These results suggest that although murine Fc epsilon RII is a lectin, it is not strictly dependent upon IgE oligosaccharides for its binding to IgE.\r"

Half-maximal inhibition was observed at 0.2 micrograms/ml CSA. The effect of CSA on several biochemical parameters involved in receptor-mediated activation of RBL cells was examined. Maximum inhibition of secretion occurred when CSA was added 5 min before activation, and inhibition was nearly maximum when the drug was added 2 min before the cells were triggered. The same results were observed when RBL cells were stimulated with A23187, a calcium ionophore. These results suggest a mechanism other than inhibition of protein synthesis is involved. Inhibition by CSA of release by either secretagogue persisted, even if CSA was removed from the buffer before the cells were triggered. No inhibition was observed of either receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, 45Ca2+ uptake, or the rise in the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ under the same conditions that produced greater than 80% inhibition of serotonin release. These results demonstrate that the early events in signal transduction are not affected, and suggest that the intracellular target for CSA participates in a later stage of exocytosis. Furthermore, the data suggest that CSA suppresses cells other than T lymphocytes and predict that patients on CSA therapy may have altered response to allergens.\r"

At this concentration LTA increased the activity from 0.97 +/- 0.2 to 4.88 +/- 0.2 nmol.10(6) mon/20 min. The role of calcium ions in the effect of LTA in stimulating respiratory burst was studied by changing the availability of calcium ions in the medium, and by measuring the effect of LTA on 45Ca2+ uptake and on intracellular Ca2+ levels. Removal of extracellular calcium ions in the presence of the calcium chelator EGTA, abolished the LTA-stimulated respiratory burst. LTA (50 ng/ml) was found to increase 45Ca2+ uptake into monocytes within seconds (from 2200 +/- 242 in the untreated cells to 4642 +/- 365 cpm/min in the LTA-treated mon). At this concentration, LTA stimulated an immediate rise in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration to 155 +/- 15 nM as compared with 120 +/- 14 nM in the unstimulated monocytes. LTA caused a specific release of arachidonic acid indicating the involvement of phospholipase A2 in the transduction signal stimulating the respiratory burst by LTA.\r"

We report that zymosan injection also stimulates the accumulation of AA, docosahexaenoic acid, linoleic acid, and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity. The amount of the unsaturated fatty acids (UnFA) varies both with the zymosan dose and time. Significantly increased levels of UnFA were first detected 15 min after zymosan injection. Maximal levels of the UnFA were reached 1 to 2 h post zymosan injection (AA: 725 +/- 29 ng/mouse, docosahexaenoic acid: 296 +/- 23 ng/mouse, linoleic acid: 4489 +/- 179 ng/mouse) and declined to saline control levels by 8 h. PLA2 activity was significantly increased 5 to 15 min after zymosan injection. Maximal levels of PLA2 activity occurred 15 to 30 min after zymosan injection (31.8 +/- 9.1 nmol phospholipid/mg protein/h) and then decreased by 30% through 24 h. Neither the appearance of UnFA nor PLA2 activity correlated with cellular influx, but both were coincident with plasma exudation at 5 to 15 min after zymosan. However, maximal exudation occurred 1 to 2 h post zymosan injection similar to that seen with the UnFA but not PLA2. These latter results suggest that a significant portion of the UnFA found in the peritoneal cavity of zymosan-injected mice originates from the plasma. PLA2 activity at the early time points (5 to 15 min) may also contribute to the levels of UnFA via hydrolysis of tissue and/or cellular phospholipids.\r"

We have used a UV-photoaffinity labeling technique to covalently attach [alpha-32P]GTP to human lymphocyte and thymocyte membrane proteins. Ten bands specifically labeled with [32P]GTP were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography in T lymphocyte membranes. Among these, a 40-kDa protein was identified by immunoblotting as the alpha-subunit of the adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G-protein, Gi, and two proteins of 44 and 46 kDa were identified as the alpha-subunits of adenylate cyclase stimulating G-protein (Gs). These proteins also served as substrates for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin and cholera toxin, respectively. Comparison of GTP-labeled membrane proteins from immature and more mature thymocytes and blood T lymphocytes, revealed that bands of 26, 30, 34, 40, 44 and 46 kDa were absent or weakly labeled in immature thymocytes, intermediate in mature thymocytes, and strongest in blood T cells. Similar increases were seen in ADP ribosylation of the substrates for pertussis, cholera, and botulinum C3 toxin. However, corresponding quantitative changes in Gi and Gs were not detected by immunoblotting, which suggests that the increased labeling is caused by enhanced affinity of the proteins for GTP rather than by increased amount of protein during thymic maturation. A concomitant maturation of GTP-induced cAMP production was seen in the cell populations, but no such change occurred in direct activation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin. The changes in some (but not all) GTP-binding proteins during acquisition of immunocompetence indicates their importance in T lymphocyte physiology.\r"

Subsequent to the activation of protein kinase C and the induction of a rise in intracellular calcium by diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, there is gene transcription and eventually cellular activation. By mimicking the initial event of B cell activation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore one can begin to identify the many mediators used in signaling between the membrane and the nucleus. We have examined the effect of calcium on arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism in several EBV-transformed human B cell lines. The cells were labelled with [3H]AA and stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187. Analysis of the supernatant by reversed-phase HPLC demonstrated a dose-dependent release of an AA metabolite that coeluted with authentic 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE). In addition, the AA metabolite coeluted with standard 5-HETE under straight-phase chromatography. Further analysis by RIA confirmed the identification of 5-HETE and revealed an additional metabolite, 5-HETE lactone (5-HL). 5-HL is the intramolecular ester of 5-HETE generated in the presence of acid. We were unable to convert [3H] 5-HETE into 5-HL during sample preparation unless cells were present, suggesting that the 5-HL, is of cellular origin. These results suggest that the AA metabolites 5-HETE and its intramolecular ester 5-HL may play a role in B cell activation because they are produced subsequent to a rise in intracellular Ca2+, an event that occurs during cross-linking of membrane Ig.\r"

In this study we have evaluated mechanisms of human neutrophil activation by urate crystals. Both N-formyl-nor-leu-leu-phe-nor-leu-tyr-lys and uncoated urate crystals (0.5 to 5 mg/ml) but not urate crystals coated with human low density lipoprotein (which suppresses crystal-induced neutrophil responsiveness), stimulated pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive GTPase activity in purified preparations of human neutrophil membranes. Hydroxyapatite crystals (up to 5 mg/ml) were inactive. Pretreatment of neutrophil membranes with cholera toxin also inhibited crystal-induced and formylated peptide-induced GTPase activity. Pretreatment of whole neutrophils with PT resulted in nearly complete inhibition of formylated peptide-induced cytosolic calcium mobilization, release of superoxide and release of the azurophil granule constituent alpha-mannosidase. In contrast, identical pretreatment of whole neutrophils with PT only partially suppressed urate crystal-induced alpha-mannosidase and superoxide release and failed to inhibit crystal phagocytosis and increases in cytosolic free calcium. Mechanisms of neutrophil activation by monosodium urate crystals appear to be heterogeneous in comparison with activation by formylated peptides and there is no absolute requirement for PT-sensitive membrane G proteins in neutrophil responsiveness to urate crystals.\r"

T cell clones of three different phenotypes were isolated and expanded into long term culture from lymph nodes of C57B1/6J mice vaccinated with irradiated S. mansoni larvae. They were characterized by surface markers, lymphokine production, and functional assays. The m.w. range of the Ag recognized by one clone was identified through nitrocellulose blotting and confirmed with a preparation of the putative protein made by immunoaffinity purification. All but one of the clones were CD4+, CD5+, Th cells. One clone, 35, produced Il-2 and IFN-gamma and was designated a TH1 clone. The others were designated TH2 clones because of Il-4 production. One clone was CD8+ and failed to show help. Clone 35 recognized live schistosomula and produced Il-2 when presented a 27-kDa protein from nitrocellulose. It proliferated in response to purified Ag. Clone 35 participated along with macrophages to induce up to 98% killing of live schistosomula in vitro. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were essential to the killing mechanism whereas Il-1, Il-2, and Il-4 were not required. This study has approached Ag identification for vaccine development from the point of view of T cells and showed that TH1 cells are essential to in vitro macrophage killing of schistosomula in murine schistosomiasis.\r"

A mAb against the type 1 CR (CR1) inhibits adherence of M. tuberculosis by 40 +/- 5%, and three different mAb against the type 3 CR (CR3) each inhibit adherence by 39 +/- 5% to 47 +/- 4%. A mAb against CR1 used in combination with one of the three mAb against CR3 inhibits adherence by up to 64 +/- 7%. Most strikingly, two mAb used in combination against CR3 inhibit adherence by up to 81 +/- 2%. mAb against other monocyte surface Ag do not significantly influence adherence. In like fashion, mAb against CR but not other monocyte surface Ag inhibit adherence of preopsonized M. tuberculosis in the presence of heat-inactivated serum. By electron microscopy, monocytes ingest all M. tuberculosis that adhere in the presence of nonimmune serum; mAb against CR3 markedly inhibit ingestion. In contrast to CR, the FcR and the beta-glucan-inhibitable receptor for zymosan play little or no role in mediating M. tuberculosis adherence or ingestion. Adherence of M. tuberculosis is serum-dependent, requiring greater than or equal to 2.5% serum for optimal adherence. Heat inactivation of serum markedly reduces adherence of M. tuberculosis (75.5 +/- 7%) and preopsonization of bacteria enhances adherence by 2.9 +/- 0.4-fold. Adherence is also markedly reduced in C3- or factor B-depleted serum; repletion with C3 or factor B increases adherence by 2.1 +/- 0.4-fold and 1.86 +/- 0.05-fold, respectively. Fab anti-C3 IgG markedly inhibits monocyte adherence of preopsonized M. tuberculosis (71 +/- 1%). C component C3 is fixed to M. tuberculosis by the alternative C pathway as determined by a whole bacterial cell ELISA. Human monocytes ingest M. tuberculosis by conventional phagocytosis as viewed by electron microscopy. This study demonstrates that human monocyte CR1 and CR3 mediate phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis and C component C3 in serum is acting as the major bacterium-bound ligand.\r"

It has therefore been inferred that the development of antibody responses to the native repetitive Ag of malaria parasites also requires linkage of T and B cell epitopes, presentation of Ag in the context of MHC class II components, and cognate T cell help for antibody production. In this study, we sought to test this assumption, by utilizing classical protocols to determine whether the antibody response to the repetitive surface Ag of malaria sporozoites, the circumsporozoite (CS) protein, is under Ir gene control. In contrast to vaccine constructs, such as recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides, secondary responses to the repetitive oligomeric domains of the native CS protein of intact malaria sporozoites do not require the presence of Ag-specific Th cells. Conferral of CS-specific Th cells does not appear to influence the magnitude of this thymus-independent response to sporozoites. In further contrast to synthetic CS analogs, exposure to the parasite appears to be associated with low levels of Ag-specific Th cell sensitization. These observations suggest a functional role in immune evasion for the immunodominant repetitive domains found within protein Ag of malaria and other parasites.\r"

We have analyzed the V region nucleotide sequences of primary and secondary antibodies with the C4 Id. Primary C4 antibodies are encoded by the same Vk gene, belonging to the Vk8 group, usually rearranged to Jk5. The H chains are diverse, encoded by VH genes belonging to at least four different VH families, a variety of DH genes, and either JH2, JH3, or JH4. There is only one somatic mutation among seven Vk and two VH genes encoding primary C4 antibodies. Secondary C4 antibodies are also encoded by the same Vk8-Jk5 gene segment and by diverse VH genes. Additional heterogeneity in the secondary response is caused by somatic mutation.\r"

Representatives of less differentiated and memory B cells (lymphomas) that have undergone the class switch to gamma 2a or gamma 2b H chains produce nearly equal amounts of membrane specific (gamma m) vs secretory specific (gamma s) mRNA. Fully differentiated gamma 2a or gamma 2b plasma cells and their tumors, myelomas, switch to higher levels of gamma s mRNA production relative to gamma m. Selective use of either the gamma s poly(A) site or the downstream gamma m poly(A) site accompanied by specific splicing events could modulate production of these two forms of mature gamma H chain mRNA. Alternatively, transcription termination could be modulated. Through a combination of hybrid protection and in vitro nascent RNA analyses of transcripts from gamma H chain-producing cells arrested at various stages of development, we have mapped transcription termination in both lymphomas (gamma s approximately gamma m mRNA) and in myelomas (gamma s much greater than gamma m) mRNA. Regardless of the developmental stage of the cell, transcription proceeds at a significant level through both the secretory- and membrane-specific poly(A) sites and terminates at least 500 nucleotides downstream of the gamma m poly(A) site in both the gamma 2a and gamma 2b genes. We conclude that transcription termination does not play a major role in the switch to elevated levels of gamma s production in late stage gamma-producing myeloma cells and that alternative RNA processing alone must be responsible for the differential expression of the gamma H chain mRNA.\r"

The V lambda x amino acid sequence is as divergent to other V lambda as to Vk gene sequences. Additionally, its third hypervariable region (CDR3) is four amino acids longer than those of all other variable gene segments of murine L chain. We have cloned and sequenced the germ-line V lambda x gene and found that the unexpected CDR3 length is encoded by the V lambda x gene. Junctional diversity is prevented by a TAA termination codon localized at the V lambda x 3' extremity. Moreover, we show a striking conservation of the V lambda x sequence in various mammalian species. Portions of the V lambda x sequence display more than 70% of nucleotide sequence identity with rabbit and human variable regions. These results suggest that V lambda x predated the divergence of mammalian species.\r"

Sequence analysis indicates that the V region of the kappa L chain gene (PopVK) has 99% homology to a V kappa IIIa germ-line gene and the V region of the mu H chain gene (PopVH) has 96% homology to the VH26 germ-line gene that is a member of the VH3 gene family. It is likely the V kappa and VH genes arose from these respective germ-line genes via somatic mutation or from closely related genes. V kappa III genes have frequently been used by other IgMk mAb especially those with rheumatoid factor activity, and the VH26 gene with no somatic mutation has been used by several anti-DNA antibodies, suggesting the possibility of preferential association of these or related germ-line genes with autoantibodies. The minor differences between the sequences of POP's VH and V kappa genes and sequences used by other autoantibodies, may be responsible for this antibody's crossreactivity with myelin and, as a result, the autoimmune neuropathy.\r"

Due to the existence of 50 to 100 discrete J genes, a potential for great diversity exists within the V-J-C alpha gene products and within the ultimate repertoire of alpha beta TCR. We have prepared hybridomas from an in vitro system that supports T cell differentiation among bone marrow cells. We have examined the J alpha genes among these cells and categorized rearrangements according to their location within the J alpha locus. It was found that alpha rearrangements were always present among the hybridomas bearing beta gene rearrangements. When two bone marrow-derived alpha-bearing chromosomes could be demonstrated in these hybridomas, both were always rearranged and rearrangements on homologous chromosomes were shown to reside in similar regions of the J alpha locus. Most surprisingly, when hybridomas were categorized by the culture from which they derived, cells from the same culture (designated as a set) demonstrated a skewing of alpha rearrangements to restricted segments of J alpha genes. In one hybridoma, rearrangements on homologous chromosomes involved J alpha genes that were either identical or situated within a 1-kb segment of DNA. The skewing within sets could not be due to clonal identity between hybridomas as the beta and gamma rearrangements in all hybridomas were different. Results suggested that skewing of J alpha gene rearrangements occurred during the course of T cell development in vitro. Should the same situation occur in vivo, the number of distinct TCR J alpha sequences available for expression in early development may be far less than that predicted by gene number alone.\r"

The H chain of this antibody derives from the small VHV family of human V region gene segments. Parallel studies on the germ-line VHV gene isolated from the same individual revealed that the expressed molecule contains 19 nucleotide differences in the VH gene segment. The D segment of Ab2 could have arisen by a D to D fusion; the J segment is a JH6. Extensive somatic variation evident in the H chain variable region of this naturally arising monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody suggests that this Ab2, the product of a CD5+ B cells, was the consequence of an Ag-driven immune response.\r"

It was found that treated mice developed nonrestricted antitumor cytolytic spleen cells of the Thy-1+, asialo GM-1+, CD4-, CD8- phenotype. Although these cells might play a role in immunopotentiating some immune responses, in vivo depletion studies using anti-asialo GM-1 mAb demonstrated that these cells were not involved in the rejection of the progressor tumor, 1591-PRO4L, by anti-CD3 mAb-treated mice. Mice treated with anti-CD3 did develop lasting tumor specific immunity as demonstrated by their ability to reject PRO4L on tumor rechallenge while being unable to reject an unrelated UV-induced tumor. The specificity of this memory implicated T cells in the response to PRO4L in anti-CD3-treated mice. Using in vivo T cell subset depletion of anti-CD3-treated animals, it was shown that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required for anti-CD3-induced tumor rejection. The CD4+ cells provide helper function and are only required in the early rejection period, whereas CD8+ cells are required throughout the immune response. In fact, examination of rejecting tumors from treated animals revealed the presence of tumor-specific CD8+ cytolytic T cells capable of cytolysis immediately after removal from the rejecting PRO4L tumor. Thus, in vivo treatment with anti-CD3 mAb likely results in the pan-stimulation of the entire T cell population, which enhances the generation of specific CD8+ T cells, which then eliminate the tumor.\r"

This difference contradicted the assumption that the same pathogen or pathogenic mechanisms were responsible for producing disease in each titration. Therefore, the end-point titrations and infectivity titers of the brain and spleen homogenates were measures of two different phenomena. Subsequent passage of a scrapie-infected spleen homogenate demonstrated that the dose-response relationship of scrapie infectivity in this agent-host system was dependent on the organ titrated, not the tissue source or inoculation route of previous passage.\r"

We prospectively studied 24 consecutively admitted neonates (birth weight less than 1350 gm, gestational age less than 31 weeks, ventilator dependent for greater than 24 hours after birth), who were eligible to receive 2000 IU supplemental vitamin A by intramuscular injection on postnatal day 1 and on alternate days thereafter for 28 days. In addition to serial assessment of vitamin A status, we measured plasma RBP just before and 1, 3, and 6 hours after an intramuscular injection of vitamin A (2000 IU/kg retinyl palmitate) on days 1 and 28. The percent increase in plasma RBP (delta-RBP) was high (mean +/- SD: 61 +/- 37%) and plasma vitamin A and RBP values were low on day 1, indicative of vitamin A deficiency. Supplemental vitamin A improved vitamin A status of all infants as shown by low delta-RBP (mean +/- SD: 8 +/- 9%) and normal plasma vitamin A and RBP values on day 28. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed in 12 of 24 infants. Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia had a higher mean (+/- SD) delta-RBP on day 28 than those without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (13 +/- 10% vs 3 +/- 3%, p less than 0.01), indicative of persistence of low vitamin A status in infants with lung disease despite supplementation. We conclude that the plasma RBP response to vitamin A is a useful indicator of vitamin A status in very low birth weight infants. Although vitamin A supplementation at the dosage used in this study normalizes conventional plasma indexes of vitamin A in very low birth weight infants, the plasma RBP response to vitamin A may continue to reflect persistence of low vitamin A status in the more immature infants with significant lung disease. We suggest that the plasma RBP response to vitamin A may be a useful functional test in such infants.\r"

  ".U": "90204280\r", 
  ".W": "The influence of Na+ and 5'-Guanylylimidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p] on [3H]rauwolscine binding to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors was studied in plasma membranes prepared from bovine aorta. Both Na+ and Gpp(NH)p increased [3H]rauwolscine affinity while maximal binding capacity (Bmax) was significantly increased only with Gpp(NH)p. The increase in affinity was solely due to an increase in the association rate, while dissociation rate was not altered. In contrast, Na+ and Gpp(NH)p each lowered the affinity of the agonist epinephrine for both high- and low-affinity binding sites. The effects of Na+ and Gpp(NH)p on agonist binding were additive, such that only in their combined presence was a homogeneous class of low-affinity sites observed. This indicates that alpha-2 receptor-guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) interactions are modulated by both Na+ and Gpp(NH)p but via different mechanisms. Amiloride (100 or 300 microM) and ethylisopropylamiloride (10 microM) produced dose-dependent reductions in [3H]rauwolscine affinity, and, in the case of amiloride, also reduced Bmax. Competition at the [3H]rauwolscine binding site as well as noncompetitive, allosteric effects were present. The presence of Na+ augmented the ability of amiloride to reduce Bmax, indicating a shared locus of action. These findings illustrate that vascular alpha-2 receptors can interact with G-proteins even in the absence of agonists (i.e., receptor/G-protein precoupling) and that Na+ ion concentration regulates this interaction. Amiloride can occupy a Na(+)-shared binding site, causing an allosterically induced loss of receptor binding, suggesting that ligand binding and G-protein binding depend upon common receptor features.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a potassium channel activator, cromakalim (BRL 34915), on excitatory nonadrenergic noncholinergic (e-NANC) and cholinergic neural bronchoconstriction was studied in guinea pigs. We monitored airway opening pressure as an index of airway caliber. After atropine (1 mg/kg iv.) and propranolol (1 mg/kg iv.), bilateral vagal stimulation evoked an e-NANC response. Cromakalim did not alter basal airway caliber, but reduced the e-NANC response to vagal stimulation in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal inhibition of 71.9 +/- 9.2% (mean +/- S.E.) at 400 micrograms/kg i.v. (P less than .01). Pretreatment with phentolamine (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) had no effect on the inhibitory response produced by cromakalim but glibenclamide (25 mg/kg iv.), an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, blocked its effect. Cromakalim had no inhibitory effect on exogenous substance P (5-25 micrograms/kg i.v.)-induced bronchoconstriction. In animals depleted of tachykinins by capsaicin (50 mg/kg s.c.) pretreatment, cromakalim had an inhibitory effect on both vagalcholinergic and exogenous acetylcholine (0.3-2 micrograms/kg i.v.)-induced bronchoconstriction, although the inhibitory effect was significantly greater on neural stimulation. We conclude that potassium channels modulate both e-NANC and cholinergic neurotransmission, and to a lesser extent acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pig airways.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of porcine endothelin on renal function were investigated in the isolated perfused rat kidney. After control clearance periods, endothelin (80, 120 or 320 pmol) or vehicle was added to the perfusate, and four 10-min experiments followed. Endothelin markedly reduced renal perfusate flow (RPF) as a result of its potent renal vasoconstrictor effect. At the highest but not low doses of endothelin, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) fell disproportionately to the reduction in RPF. Fractional Na excretion was also increased after kidney exposure to endothelin, suggesting an inhibition of tubular Na reabsorption by the peptide. Perfusion with low [Ca] severely blunted the hemodynamic effects of endothelin. Pharmacological blocking of renal cyclooxygenase by indomethacin or ibuprofen caused a further decline in RPF, GFR and absolute but not fractional Na excretion in kidneys challenged with endothelin. Atrial natriuretic peptide increased GFR and filtration fraction (FF), but not RPF, in kidneys previously exposed to 120 pmol endothelin. This was associated with a dramatic diuretic and natriuretic effect. The results demonstrate that 1) endothelin acts directly on the kidney, eliciting hemodynamic, diuretic and natriuretic responses that are dependent on the dose used and partially on the availability of extracellular Ca, 2) the renal effects of endothelin are exacerbated by cyclooxygenase blocking, suggesting that the vasoconstrictor effect of the peptide may be modulated by vasodilatory prostaglandins, and 3) atrial natriuretic peptide counteracts the renal function deterioration induced by endothelin, raising the possibility of an interplay between these vasoactive hormones in the control of renal function.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of aging on responses of vascular smooth muscles to atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and other vasodilator substances was investigated in isolated rat aortae, rat renal arteries and monkey renal arteries which were precontracted with norepinephrine. There was no significant difference in the ANP-induced maximum relaxation between young and old rat aortae. However, the concentration of agonists causing a 50% relaxation (ED50) value for the old rats was 7.3 times greater than that for the young ones. In rat and monkey renal arteries, the ED50 ratios were 6.2 and 3.8, respectively. The relaxant responses of the rat aortae to isoproterenol and acetylcholine also decreased with increasing age. The ED50 ratios for isoproterenol and acetylcholine were more than 40 and 17, respectively. The maximum relaxation induced by 10(-5) M isoproterenol also decreased significantly in the aortae from the older rats. On the other hand, the ED50 for nitroprusside, nifedipine- and potassium-induced relaxation was not affected by increasing age. These results suggest that ANP-induced relaxation of vascular smooth muscles is reduced with increasing age in rat aortae, rat renal arteries and monkey renal arteries. The mechanisms by which the ANP-induced relaxation decreased in association with the aging process may be quite different from those in acetylcholine-induced and beta adrenoceptor-induced relaxation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of BRL 34915, a newly developed potassium channel opener, on renal hemodynamics and function were investigated in anesthetized dogs. An i.v. injection of BRL 34915 (4, 20 and 100 micrograms/kg) caused a dose-related reduction of mean arterial pressure but there were no significant changes in renal blood flow. The agent at lower doses (4 and 20 micrograms/kg) produced a slight increasing action on urine formation. When BRL 34915 was infused intrarenally at nonhypotensive doses (0.04 and 0.2 micrograms/kg/min), there were no significant increases in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. At 1.0 micrograms/kg/min, a dose which produced a slight reduction in mean arterial pressure, significant decreases in calculated renal vascular resistance were observed, thereby indicating that BRL 34915 has vasodilator action on the renal vasculature. In cases of infusion at higher doses (0.2 and 1.0 micrograms/kg/min), the levels of urine flow, urinary excretion of sodium and fractional excretion of sodium were elevated significantly and these events were accompanied by decreases in urine osmolality. Although the intrarenal administration of BRL 34915 at higher doses produced no alterations in the fractional excretion of lithium (index of sodium excretion at the proximal tubules), the agent did increase the calculated value of the fractional distal excretion of sodium. These effects seen when BRL 34915 was infused intrarenally were suppressed markedly by glibenclamide (6 mg/kg i.v.), a putative inhibitor of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. Our results suggest that BRL 34915 has renal vasodilating and diuretic effects as a result of opening the potassium channels within the kidney. The agent-induced diuresis may be due partly to an inhibitory effect on sodium reabsorption at the distal portion of the tubules beyond the proximal tubules.\r"

The release of endogenous dopamine and noradrenaline from rat whole brain synaptosomes were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detector. The change of [Ca++]i was measured fluorometrically using a Ca++ indicator, Quin-2. Whether extracellular Ca++ was present or not, 30 microM veratridine, a Na(+)-ionophore, increased the release of endogenous dopamine and noradrenaline. In the presence of 1.25 mM Ca++, 30 microM veratridine increased [Ca++]i. In contrast, in the absence of extracellular Ca++, veratridine did not affect [Ca++]i. Ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) increased the release of dopamine and noradrenaline in Ca-Mg-free medium. This stimulatory effect of EGTA seemed to be the result of an increase in the influx of Na+ through Ca++ channels in the absence of divalent cation. In Ca-Mg-free medium, EGTA caused a slight decrease in [Ca++]i. The EGTA-stimulated release of dopamine and noradrenaline was blocked by La which also significantly blocked the decrease in [Ca++]i observed after the addition of EGTA. These results suggest that the Na(+)-dependent release of dopamine and noradrenaline may not depend on a change in [Ca++]i. Veratridine (30 microM)-induced release of dopamine and noradrenaline were detected simultaneously. However, the time needed to induce the maximal stimulatory effect of veratridine on the release of dopamine was apparently shorter than that of noradrenaline. This delay might suggest that the Na(+)-dependent release process of dopamine is not similar to that of noradrenaline.\r"

In a 5-day adjuvant arthritis model, romazarit inhibited the development of hindpaw inflammation with a minimum effective dose of 30 mg kg-1. Plasma levels of the acute phase reactants seromucoid and haptoglobulin were also significantly reduced. Romazarit was equally effective in adrenalectomized animals, indicating that the compound is not acting via stimulation of the pituitary/adrenal axis. When the developing adjuvant arthritis was extended to 15 days romazarit showed dose-related improvements of all the symptoms of arthritis with a minimum effective dose of 25 mg kg-1. Romazarit caused a dose-dependent (range 20-250 mg kg-1) reduction in both the inflammatory and bony changes occurring during collagen arthritis in the rat, without any significant effect on anticollagen antibody titers except at the highest dose. Collagenase and prostaglandin E2 production in cultures of talus bones taken from rats with collagen arthritis were reduced by romazarit. In vitro romazarit was an extremely weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase activity in both sheep seminal vesicle (IC50 6500 microM) and rat renal medulla (IC50 greater than 300 microM) cell-free preparations. Romazarit showed little or no activity in models of acute inflammation such as rabbit skin edema, carrageenan pleurisy or UV-induced erythema. In both acute and chronic tests romazarit displayed no ulcerogenic potential. In comparison with the structurally similar compound clobuzarit, hepatic changes such as increases in catalase and peroxisome proliferation-associated 80,000 mol.wt. protein were markedly less with romazarit. Clinical studies with romazarit are currently in progress.\r"

  ".W": "The serotonin 1b (5-HT1b) receptor is thought to mediate both pre- and postsynaptic actions of serotonin. Until recently 5-HT1b sites were thought to be present only in rodent brain. We now report the presence of high-affinity [125I]iodocyanopindolol [( 125I] ICYP) binding sites in the mouse renal medulla with properties identical to those of brain 5-HT1b receptors. In vitro receptor autoradiography demonstrates that [125I]ICYP binding is highly localized to the outer stripe of the renal medulla. Association and dissociation kinetics, saturation analysis and competition displacement analyses indicate that renal medullary [125I]ICYP binding sites exhibit identical properties with brain 5-HT1b receptors. Incubation of renal medullary or brain membranes with guanylimidodiphosphate results in a decreased affinity of 5-HT1b sites for 5-HT and [125I]ICYP; this can be reversed by the addition of a purified mixture of G proteins (Gi/Go). Treatment of brain or kidney membranes with N-ethylmaleimide results in a decrease in 5-HT1b binding which can also be restored by reconstitution with purified G proteins. Adenylyl cyclase from renal medullary homogenates or minces can be stimulated more than 3-fold by forskolin and attenuated by 5-HT. These results indicate that mouse kidney contains high-affinity 5-HT1b receptors with identical properties to those found in brain. These are localized in the outer stripe of the renal medulla and are functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (Gi) G-proteins.\r"

Analysis of the associations of the idiotypes with clinical, hematological, and serological characteristics revealed that significantly decreased serum levels of 3 idiotypes (103.1, 100, and 1305) were associated with nephritis and that one of these idiotypes (103.1) was also associated with discoid rash. An association of lowered levels of 3 idiotype markers (604, 1305, and 1400) was also observed with the presence of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. Serial studies in individual patients with SLE nephritis failed to show a close correlation of serum idiotype levels with the degree of proteinuria, creatinine clearance, anti-DNA antibody, or complement values. The association of decreased levels of specific idiotypes with the presence of nephritis, discoid rash, and antiphospholipid antibodies suggests the participation of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of disease.\r"

The antigen panel specifically identified the particular autoantibodies present and had a high level of sensitivity which was reflected by the frequency of detection of autoantibodies in different patient groups. All active patients with SLE were positive for at least one autoantibody and 80% of these patients had 3 or more autoantibodies compared to only 20% of inactive patients. A large heterogeneity in antibody profiles was also noted. About 90% of patients with positive FANA, but no detectable autoimmune rheumatic disorder, i.e., false positive, were negative by the panel. A new method of standardization was designed to use the ANA/6 quantitatively. Very large differences in the level of all 6 autoantibodies were observed between sera from patients with active and inactive SLE, suggesting a potential usefulness of ANA/6 for patient management.\r"

Use of pediatric ambulatory medical care by patients in the independent practice association plan and control patients was determined by medical chart review for 1 year before and 1 year after each patient's switch. During the baseline year, patients who would join the independent practice association plan already had 19% more acute-illness visits than control patients. During the second year, patients in the independent practice association plan averaged 42% more acute-illness visits, 22% more well child-care visits, 93% more chronic-illness visits, 27% more after-hours visits, 53% more weekend visits, 185% more laboratory studies, and 70% more referrals.

  ".W": "The value of prophylactic monoclonal or polyclonal antibody therapy early after cardiac transplantation is controversial. Between Jan. 1, 1987, and July 1, 1988, 32 consecutive patients underwent cardiac transplantation (cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone maintenance therapy) with either early prophylactic rabbit antithymocyte globulin (n = 17) or monoclonal OKT3 (Ortho Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Raritan, N.J.) (10 days) (n = 15). Follow-up was through Sept. 1, 1988, for morbid events and through Jan. 1, 1989, for survival. All patients (100%) survived the study period (follow-up of 6 to 24 months). The efficacy of rabbit antithymocyte globulin and OKT3 prophylaxis was similar regarding median time (days) to first rejection (16 versus 21 days, p = 0.5), number of rejection episodes during first 2 months (1.5 versus 1.3 days, p = 0.8), and freedom from rejection at 2 months (18% versus 27%, p = 0.8). Early infections were slightly less common in the rabbit antithymocyte globulin group than the OKT3 group (median time to first infection: 318 versus 250 days, p = 0.5; freedom from rejection at 2 months: 82% versus 64%, p = 0.21), although differences were likely due to chance. Cytomegalovirus syndrome was common, with one case of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. T-cell markers during OKT3 treatment did not predict subsequent rejection (within 2 weeks after OKT3) as assessed by mean T3-lymphocyte count during OKT3 use (p = 0.3) or T3-lymphocyte count during the last 3 days of OKT3 use (p = 0.4). Inferences: (1) Prophylactic rabbit antithymocyte globulin or OKT3 with triple-drug immunosuppression yields excellent intermediate survival after heart transplantation. (2) These protocols for rabbit antithymocyte globulin and OKT3 provide similar protection against early rejection with a relatively low risk of early infection. (3) T-cell markers do not predict early rejection after OKT3.\r"

  ".W": "Respiratory support by means of arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation driven by systemic arterial pressure, in contrast to pump-driven venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, is attractive because of its simplicity and lack of trauma to formed blood elements. Although arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been shown to improve arterial blood gases, useful levels of arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation shunt flow may exert detrimental effects on systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics. Therefore the hemodynamic consequences of arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were studied in 11 dogs that were anesthetized, heparinized, and their lungs mechanically ventilated (FIO2 = 0.21) before and after induction of oleic acid pulmonary edema. The data indicate that arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation shunt flows adequate to improve arterial blood gases resulted in significant changes in peripheral vascular resistance (-46%; p less than 0.05), systemic arterial blood pressure (-20%; p less than 0.05), and cardiac output (+110%; p less than 0.05). Dopamine infusion (5 micrograms/kg/min) proved to be more effective than volume expansion (15 ml/kg) in maintaining cardiac output, arterial blood pressure, and arterial blood gases. We conclude that pumpless arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, at flow rates adequate for respiratory support, can adversely alter systemic hemodynamics. However, these effects can be beneficially modulated by a moderate dose of inotropic medication.\r"

  ".W": "An enzyme immunoassay (Ortho-HCV ELISA) for antibodies against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) was used to test 143 serum samples from 53 patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (AI-CAH). Optical density (OD) values in the assay correlated closely with serum globulin (r = 0.8846, p much less than 0.0005) and IgG (r = 0.6281, p less than 0.0005) concentrations but not with immunosuppressant therapy. OD values were positive in 20 (65%) of 31 with active disease and in only 1 (5%) of 22 in remission (p less than 0.0005). The association between positive results and active disease and high serum globulin levels was confirmed by serial studies in 6 of the patients. In contrast, none of 31 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and only 2 of 24 with non-hepatic disorders associated with high IgG concentrations were positive, and these controls showed no correlation between OD values and serum globulins or IgG. The findings suggest that serum from AI-CAH patients may contain a component that gives false-positive results in the assay.\r"

Superoxide dismutases were assayed by specific radioimmunoassays, which enabled the study of a small individual murine muscle. Glutathione peroxidase and catalase were increased markedly in each individual dystrophic skeletal muscle studied and less markedly in the heart. Manganosuperoxide dismutase and thiobarbituric acid reactivity were decreased to a similar extent in each dystrophic skeletal muscle. Cuprozinc superoxide dismutase was decreased in the soleus muscle. Only a minimal biochemical change occurred in nonmuscles. Fumarase activity correlated closely with the level of manganosuperoxide dismutase. These results suggest that muscle protein breakdown occurs independently of lipid peroxidation despite the presence of tissue-specific abnormality of redox metabolism in dystrophic muscle.\r"

  ".U": "90206004\r", 
  ".W": "There is controversy about whether hospitalized poor patients use more resources and whether hospitals that provide care for the poor therefore merit supplementary payment under per-case prospective payment systems. We previously reported that patients of low socioeconomic status with connective-tissue disease had longer hospital stays and higher costs than patients of higher socioeconomic status at a single hospital. To examine the generalizability of this phenomenon, we interviewed 16,908 (83 percent) of 20,278 consecutive adult patients (excluding obstetrical and psychiatric patients) admitted in 1987 to five Massachusetts hospitals, to obtain information on three direct measures of socioeconomic status (income, occupation, and education). We divided each measure into three strata. Thus, there were 15 comparisons--three measures of socioeconomic status applied to each of five hospitals. After excluding outliers and adjusting for diagnosis-related group (DRG), we found that the patients of the lowest socioeconomic status had hospital stays 3 to 30 percent longer than those of patients of higher status, the differences varying with the hospital and the indicator of socioeconomic status (P less than or equal to 0.05 for 11 of the 15 comparisons). Hospital charges were 1 to 18 percent higher for the patients of lowest socioeconomic status than for those of higher status (P less than or equal to 0.05 for 9 of 15 comparisons). When we adjusted for age, severity of illness, and DRG, the patients of lowest socioeconomic status had longer stays than those of higher status in 14 of 15 comparisons (P less than 0.05 for 7 of the 15) and higher charges in 13 of 15 comparisons (P less than 0.05 for 6 of the 15). The differences between patients of high and low status ranged up to 21 percent for length of stay and 13 percent for charges. Our findings suggest that hospitalized patients of lower socioeconomic status have longer stays and probably require more resources. Supplementary payments to hospitals for the treatment of poor patients merit further consideration.\r"

Several lines of evidence indicate that beta-2 microglobulin (beta 2m) and/or peptide ligand participate in the intracellular transport and surface expression of class I molecules, but the nature of their involvement is still unclear. Here we present evidence that culturing non-mutant cells (fibroblast, thymoma or mastocytoma) with a peptide ligand specific for the Ld class I molecule of the mouse leads to a dramatic (fourfold) and specific induction of Ld surface expression. Surprisingly, this peptide ligand-induced expression of Ld does not result in an increased intracellular association of Ld with beta 2m. These findings demonstrate that the previously reported decrease in surface expression of Ld results from its failure to be saturated with endogenous self-peptide ligands. This unique feature of Ld could also contribute to the fact that several virus-specific cytotoxic T cell responses have been found to be Ld-restricted.\r"

By using 'whole-terminal' patch-clamp and circuit-analysis techniques to measure membrane capacitance, we have now monitored changes in the surface membrane area of individual nerve terminals isolated from the mammalian neurohypophysis. A single depolarizing pulse leading to Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated calcium channels, rapidly and reproducibly increases the membrane area by an amount corresponding to the fusion of 1-100 secretory vesicles. The magnitude of the capacitance increase depends not only on Ca2+ entry and buffering, but also on the pattern of stimulation revealing facilitation, fatigue and recovery of the release process.\r"

  ".W": "Somatic sexual differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster is accomplished by a hierarchy of genes of which one, Sex-lethal (Sxl), is required for the functional female-specific splicing of the transcripts of the immediately downstream regulatory gene, transformer (tra). The first exon of the tra primary transcript is spliced to one of two acceptor sites. Splicing to the upstream site yields a messenger RNA which is neither sex-specific nor functional, but that produced after splicing to the downstream acceptor site yields a functional female-specific mRNA. Here we address the question of how the Sxl gene product determines the alternative splicing of tra primary transcripts. One suggestion is that non-sex-specific splicing to the upstream acceptor is blocked in female flies by sex-specific factors, but neither the identity of the female-specific factors nor the mechanism of the blockage has been specified. We have now performed co-transfection experiments in which Sxl complementary DNA and the tra gene are expressed in Drosophila Kc cells. Moreover, we find that female Sxl-encoded protein binds specifically to the tra transcript at or near the non-sex-specific acceptor site, implying that the female Sxl gene product is the trans-acting factor that regulates the alternative splicing.\r"

  ".U": "90206054\r", 
  ".W": "A primary response to many growth factor-induced transmembrane signals is the rapid activation of transcription of the proto-oncogene c-fos and other early-response genes, including the beta-actin gene. The c-raf gene encodes a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase, raf-1, whose activity is also responsive to transmembrane signals and which in mutant form can transform cells. Here we show that in transient assays, the v-raf protein, which is a constitutively activated oncogenic counterpart of raf-1, can transactivate transcription from two early-response promoters, including the c-fos promoter from human and murine cells and the human beta-actin gene promoter. Multiple elements of the human fos promoter, including the dyad symmetry element necessary for growth-factor induction, an octanucleotide direct repeat element, and the region spanning the sequence from nucleotides -225 to -99 can all serve as targets for raf induction. The c-myc promoter and two adenovirus-2 early promoters are not induced. These findings indicate that raf kinase, when activated by a transmembrane signal or by mutation of a regulatory domain, can phosphorylate a factor(s) capable of regulating transcription of the c-fos and actin genes. The oncogenic form of raf may transform by constitutively activating early response protooncogenes such as c-fos.\r"

The patients graded runny nose, congestion, and throat irritation, and sneezes were counted. Significant (p less than 0.01) increases in all parameters were found when comparing antigen challenge with diluent challenge, but no differences were seen among the treatment groups. Thus, oral L-649,923 was not effective in blocking the symptoms of the early nasal allergic response.\r"

Photodynamic therapy consists of the intravenous administration of (di)hematoporphyrin ether, a chemosensitizing drug selectively retained by neoplastic and reticuloendothelial tissues which, when exposed to a 630-nm argon laser, catalyzes a photochemical reaction to release free oxygen radicals, \"the cytotoxic\" agents responsible for cell death and tumor necrosis. Preliminary investigations have assessed the efficacy of photodynamic therapy in treatment of: (1) superficial \"condemned mucosa\" or \"field cancerization\" of the oral cavity and (2) stage III and IV head and neck carcinomas that had unsuccessful conventional therapy. Complete and/or partial remissions were obtained in 11 of 12 patients (16 treatments) with a variety of carcinomas of the nasopharynx, palate and uvula, retromolar trigone, temporal bone, cervical esophagus, and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma of the oral cavity.\r"

Second, to reconcile a longstanding discrepancy involving the effect of lung inflation on vocal cord position. Abductor laryngospasm was induced in six anesthetized, tracheotomized dogs by the administration of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) after occlusion of the trachea for 60 seconds. Abductor laryngospasm was characterized by sustained vocal cord abduction with concomitant massive, continuous posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA) electromyography (EMG) activity and little or no laryngeal adductor muscle EMG activity. Vocal cord opening was sustained for up to 90 seconds. In the same dogs, administration of CPAP, after hyperventilation of the animal, resulted in adductor laryngospasm. Adductor laryngospasm was characterized by steady apposition of the vocal cords, massive laryngeal adductor muscle EMG activity, and silent PCA EMG activity. Abductor laryngospasm appears to be the physiologic converse of adductor laryngospasm. The results of this study show that lung inflation can produce either vocal cord abduction or adduction, depending on whether the dog is hypoventilated or hyperventilated before administration of CPAP.\r"

Power settings of 400 mJ and 600 mJ per pulse at 2 pulses per second were used, and wound healing was studied over a 2-week period. Excellent control of depth of tissue ablation was noted, with uncomplicated wound repair. Although healing was somewhat slower compared with healing when the CO2 laser was used, less granulation and fewer inflammatory changes were noted. Further studies need to be performed to determine ideal laser dosimetry before this laser is applied clinically.\r"

Scrapie-associated fibrils [and their major protein, prion protein (PrP)] accumulate in the brains of all species affected by scrapie and related diseases. PrP is encoded by a single gene that is linked to (and may be) the major gene controlling the incubation period of the various strains of scrapie pathogens. To investigate the role of PrP in natural scrapie, we have determined its gene structure and expression in the natural host. We have isolated two sheep genomic DNA clones that encode proteins of 256 amino acids with high homology to the PrPs of other species. Sheep PrPs have an arginine/glutamine polymorphism at position 171 that may be related to the alleles of the scrapie incubation-control gene in this species.\r"

The presence of the primary intermediate was confirmed by a comparison of the iron-dioxygen stretching frequency with that obtained in the reaction of oxygen with the mixed-valence enzyme. For both of these preparations, the Fe-O2 stretching mode is detected at 568 cm-1, the same frequency as that found in oxyhemoglobin and oxymyoglobin. These data illustrate that the primary intermediate may be generated and detected at room temperature in the fully reduced enzyme and that the oxidation state of cytochrome a does not affect the structure of the iron-dioxygen complex. By following the changes in the intensity of the Fe-O2 stretching mode in the resonance Raman spectrum as a function of time, the first-order rate constant for the decay of the primary intermediate was found to be 3.5 x 10(4) s-1 (t1/2 = 20 microseconds).\r"

Adhesion of infected erythrocytes along the vascular endothelium as well as binding of uninfected erythrocytes to cells infected with late-stage asexual parasites (rosetting) may be important in erythrocyte sequestration. We report that the recently discovered rosetting phenomenon shares characteristics with other human cell-cell interactions (heparin sensitivity, temperature independence, Ca2+/Mg2+ and pH dependence). Mono- and polyclonal antibodies specific for PfHRP1, a histidine-rich protein present in the membrane of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes, disrupt rosettes but do not affect attachment of infected erythrocytes to endothelial cells. The inhibitory anti-PfHRP1 antibodies reacted with rosetting parasites in indirect immunofluorescence and with P. falciparum polypeptides of Mr 28,000 and Mr 90,000 in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, respectively. No inhibitory effects on erythrocyte rosetting were obtained with antibodies to related histidine-rich or other antigens of P. lophurae or P. falciparum. Whether the epitope that mediates rosetting, and is recognized by the anti-PfHRP1 antibodies, is located on PfHRP1 or on a crossreactive antigen remains to be established. The results suggest that endothelial cytoadherence and erythrocyte rosetting involve different molecular mechanisms.\r"

However, both of them together potently and fully inhibit the process. Transport of beta-alanine, which exhibits an apparent Km of about 44 microM, is also electrogenic and sodium and chloride dependent and competitively inhibited by GABA with a Ki of about 3 microM. This value is very similar to the Km of 2-4 microM found for GABA transport. On the other hand, ACHC does not inhibit beta-alanine transport at all. Upon solubilization of the membrane proteins with cholate and fractionation with ammonium sulfate, a fraction is obtained which upon reconstitution into proteoliposomes exhibits 4- to 10-fold-increased GABA transport. This activity is fully inhibited by low concentrations of ACHC and is not sensitive at all to beta-alanine. GABA transport in this preparation exhibits an apparent Km of about 2.5 microM and it is competitively inhibited by ACHC (Ki approximately 7 microM). These data indicate the presence of two GABA transporter subtypes in the membrane vesicles: the A type, sensitive to ACHC, and the B type, sensitive to beta-alanine.\r"

When mature thymocytes were precisely defined (as CD4+CD8- CD3+ or CD4-CD8+ CD3+) and separated from immature single positives (CD4+CD8- CD3- and CD4-CD8+ CD3-), a lag was observed in the rate of entry of [3H]thymidine into mature cells. Thus, many of the mature thymocytes appear to derive from a small nondividing cortical thymocyte pool, rather than originating directly from the earliest dividing CD4+CD8+ blasts. There was little evidence for cell division during or after mature thymocyte formation, suggesting a one-for-one differentiation from cortical cells rather than selective clonal expansion. The rate of production of mature single positive thymocytes agreed closely with estimates of the rate of export of mature T cells from the thymus and was only 3% of the rate of production of double-positive cortical thymocytes. This was compatible with a stringent selection process and extensive intrathymic cell death and suggested that no extensive negative selection occurred after the mature cells were formed.\r"

Transformation of E. coli HB101 with pMYG1 resulted in a 6-fold increase in superoxide dismutase activity. There was also induction of Mn superoxide dismutase in the transformants upon exposure to paraquat, as evidenced by dramatically increased levels of the Mn superoxide dismutase polypeptide in cytoplasmic extracts and a 16-fold further increase in superoxide dismutase activity. As well, the E. coli transformants showed resistance to paraquat-mediated inhibition of growth. Anacystis nidulans, a cyanobacterium that has no detectable Mn superoxide dismutase and is, consequently, very sensitive to oxidative stress, was also transformed with pMYG1. The transformants had detectable levels of Mn superoxide dismutase protein and showed resistance to paraquat-mediated inhibition of growth and photobleaching of pigments. Paraquat is known to promote formation of the superoxide radical anion, O2-., and thus the data have been interpreted as indicating that the cloned Mn superoxide dismutase provides protection in both E. coli and A. nidulans against damage attributable to O2-..\r"

The transforming gene product pp60v-src very effectively activated pp90rsk, whereas the products of c-src and the myristoylation-minus nontransforming virus NY315 were markedly less effective. Only a fraction of the total pp90rsk population was activated, and it could be partially separated from unactivated protein by ion-exchange chromatography. When compared to the unactivated form, the activated enzyme displayed about a 4000-fold increase in the capacity to phosphorylate the ribosomal protein S6. The enhanced enzymatic activity appeared to be due to phosphorylation of pp90rsk.\r"

After repeated subtractive hybridization cycles, tester is separated from driver by avidin/biotin affinity chromatography, and single-stranded target is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, rendering it double-stranded and clonable. We model two situations: the gain of sequences that result from infection with a pathogen and the loss of sequences that result from a large hemizygous deletion.

Degenerate oligonucleotides, based on the amino acid sequence of the protein, were used to amplify an internal fragment of the gene from human placental cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction. This fragment was then used to probe a human placental cDNA library. A 3.3-kilobase (kb) insert was isolated and sequenced. The insert has a single extended open reading frame that predicts a 435 amino acid protein of Mr approximately 50,000. From the amino terminus to residue 321, the deduced amino acid sequence is identical to that previously determined by peptide sequencing [Charbonneau, H., Tonks, N. K., Kumar, S., Diltz, C. D., Harrylock, M., Cool, D. E., Krebs, E. G., Fischer, E. H. & Walsh, K. A. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 5252-5256]; however, the sequence predicts that the protein contains an additional 114 amino acids not present in the reported peptide sequence. In vitro translation of the 3.3-kb insert produces a protein of Mr 56,000, in general agreement with the predicted size. The phosphatase gene appears to be present as a single copy in human genomic DNA and is transcribed into a 3.5-kb message in a variety of tissues.\r"

The optA1 mutation maps to 3.6 min on the E. coli chromosome and is closely linked to dapD. We have isolated the gene encoding dGTPase (dgt) from wild-type E. coli and determined its nucleotide sequence. The dgt gene lies immediately upstream of htrA and 6 kilobases from dapD, in the same region as the optA1 mutation. The dgt structural gene is 1515 base pairs, encoding a protein of 59,315 daltons, in agreement with the size and N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein. An E. coli strain containing a null allele has no detectable phenotype when grown at 30-42 degrees C in rich medium. A transition of C to T in a potential promoter of dgt is required for expression of the optA1 phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the capacity of our established thymic stromal cell clone (MRL104.8a) or its derived factor(s) to induce the differentiation of immature thymocytes. Culture of purified adult murine double-negative (CD4-CD8-, indicated here as CD4-8-) thymocytes on the MRL104.8a thymic stromal cell monolayer for 1 day resulted in the induction of an appreciable percentage of CD4-8+ thymocytes. A bone marrow-derived stromal cell monolayer or a L929 fibroblast monolayer failed to generate CD4-8+ cells. This differentiation could also be induced by a semipurified sample of the MRL104.8a culture supernatant, which contained a thymic stroma-derived T-cell growth factor capable of contributing to the growth of double-negative immature thymocytes. CD4-8+ thymocytes generated 1 day after coculture with the MRL104.8a cells or the sample containing thymic stroma-derived T-cell growth factor were found to be CD3- and J11d+, excluding the possibility of expansion of mature (CD3+4-8+) thymocytes present in the thymus. More importantly, when the culture period was extended to 2 or 3 days, an appreciable number of CD4+8+ and single-positive (CD4+) cells were generated on the MRL104.8a monolayer. Thus, these results provide the direct demonstration that CD3-4-8- immature thymocytes are promoted to differentiate through a rapidly cycling intermediate (CD3-4-8+) into double- and single-positive cells by a specialized thymic stromal component.\r"

These proteins also share a homologous domain found in the B1 chain of laminin, a matrix adhesion protein, and placental protein 12, an insulin-like growth factor I binding protein secreted during pregnancy that has been implicated in regulation of fetal growth.

This gap repair was sometimes accompanied by reciprocal recombination (crossing over). The gap stimulated recombination about 100-fold. Our results are compatible with previous proposals that lambda homologous recombination involves the following early steps: (i) generation of double-stranded ends by the packaging machinery or by the replication machinery; (ii) production of a single-stranded tail with a 3'-hydroxyl end by 5'----3' degradation by lambda exonuclease (red alpha gene product); (iii) pairing of the single-stranded tail with a complementary strand from a homologous duplex with the help of beta protein (red beta gene product); (iv) priming of DNA synthesis at this 3'-hydroxyl end to copy the second DNA molecule.\r"

The bovine cDNA cloning used probes designed on the basis of NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of bovine MI. The human cDNA cloning in turn used probes representing parts of the bovine cDNA nucleotide sequence. Both cDNAs encode leader sequences of 26 amino acids and mature protein sequences of 194 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of the mature proteins are 94% identical. The human MI cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli, and a preparation containing anticollagenase activity was recovered. The amino acid sequence of mature human MI is 38% identical to the sequence for human TIMP, and the 12 cysteines in MI and TIMP are aligned almost identically.

After expression of the mRNA, Ca2+ was imaged in the oocytes with a digital imaging fluorescence microscopy system using the Ca2(+)-sensitive dyes fura-2 and fluo-3. Application of substance K caused a dose-related wave of Ca2+ mobilization to spread from a focus and to elevate the Ca2+ concentration in the oocyte. Activation of endogenous muscarinic or angiotensin II receptors in noninjected oocytes evoked a similar response. The Ca2+ rise in oocytes induced by substance K was due to internal Ca2+ mobilization and was independent of external Ca2+, since it occurred in Ca2(+)-free medium fortified with 2 mM EGTA. The Ca2+ imaging was well correlated with ion current measurements of voltage-clamped oocytes. Imaging, in addition to detecting the spatial spread of Ca2+ across the cell, was at least as sensitive as voltage clamping and much faster when screening oocytes for the expression of receptor mRNAs that stimulate Ca2+ mobilization. While it is known that fertilization of Xenopus eggs causes a spreading wave of Ca2+ mobilization, we found that activation of either native or newly expressed receptors in oocytes causes a similar change in Ca2+ distribution.\r"

  ".W": "A panel of Trypanosoma cruzi antigens produced by recombinant DNA techniques was used to analyze the IgM and IgG specificities present in sera from 22 mothers with chronic Chagas disease and their newborn infants. Ten of the newborns were congenitally infected and the other 12 children were healthy. While in most cases IgG specificities in the newborns mirrored those of their mothers, congenitally infected newborns had, in addition, IgG specificities that were undetectable in their mothers. The new IgG specificities observed most frequently were against a shed acute-phase antigen (SAPA), and less frequently, against other nine different parasite antigens. Thus, SAPA is able to identify new fetal IgGs because antibodies against this antigen are generated during the acute phase of the infection and not in their chronically infected mothers. Sera from congenital cases also had IgMs against several parasite antigens, but again, SAPA was the most frequently detected. Neither IgMs nor new IgG specificities were detected in healthy children born to mothers with Chagas disease. We conclude that individual antigens can be used to detect new IgG specificities present in the cord blood from infected newborns. Furthermore, detection of IgMs and new fetal IgGs with recombinant antigens may be used to sort out congenitally infected infants from uninfected ones, a method that might be applied to other infectious diseases.\r"

The surveys are blinded (serologic test results not identified with a person) as well as nonblinded (clients voluntarily agreeing to participate). STD clinics are important sentinel sites for the surveillance of HIV infection because they serve persons who are at increased risk as a result of certain behaviors, such as unprotected sex, homosexual exposure, or intravenous drug use. HIV seroprevalence rates will be obtained in the sentinel clinics each year so that trends in infection can be assessed over an extended period of time. Behaviors that place clients at risk for infection, or protect against infection, are being evaluated in voluntary, nonblinded surveys to define groups for appropriate interventions and to detect changes in response to education and prevention programs. Although inferences drawn from the surveys are limited by the scope of the clinics and clients surveyed, HIV trends in STD clinic client populations should provide a sensitive monitor of the course of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic among persons engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors.\r"

Systematic surveillance of HIV infection among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in the United States is essential to monitor the HIV epidemic and to target and evaluate prevention programs for IVDUs and their partners. The most accessible segment of the largely covert population of IVDUs are those in drug treatment programs. In collaboration with State and local health departments and drug abuse treatment agencies, the Centers for Disease Control is conducting blinded (serologic test results not linked to identifiable persons) and nonblinded (in which clients voluntarily agree to participate) surveys of IVDUs entering drug treatment in 39 U.S. metropolitan areas. The same protocol is used in all participating drug treatment centers. Blinded surveys will be carried out annually to determine HIV seroprevalence rates in eligible IVDUs entering drug treatment and to monitor trends over time. Each year, nonblinded surveys of IVDUs entering drug treatment will assess self-reported drug use and sexual behaviors to help design educational interventions and to detect changes in behavior over time. This sentinel surveillance system, using a standardized methodology, will provide the best national and regional data available on the seroprevalence of HIV among IVDUs and the relationships of drug use, sexual behaviors, and HIV serologic status of IVDUs.\r"

A review of published and unpublished studies showed that HIV seroprevalence among women attending women's health clinics was 0 to 2.6 percent, although the studies were difficult to compare because of differences in methodology. The Centers for Disease Control, in association with State and local health departments, has developed a standardized protocol to determine HIV seroprevalence among women attending women's health clinics in selected metropolitan areas. Blinded HIV serosurveys (serologic test results not identified with a person) are being conducted annually in selected sentinel clinics in order to obtain estimates of HIV seroprevalence unbiased by self-selection, as well as to monitor trends in infection among clients attending these clinics. In areas with high HIV seroprevalence, nonblinded serosurveys (in which clients voluntarily agree to participate) will be used to assess behaviors that may place women at increased risk of exposure to HIV. Data from the surveys can be used in developing age-specific and culturally appropriate AIDS educational materials, assessing the amount and type of counseling activities required, and evaluating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention activities. The information will provide epidemiologic data to complement the results of other surveys in characterizing the scope of HIV infection among women of childbearing age in the United States.\r"

Increases in TB cases have occurred in areas which have reported large numbers of cases of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and a high proportion of these TB cases have been HIV seropositive. Therefore, increasing numbers of HIV-infected persons may be found in TB clinics and hospitals. HIV serologic surveys in TB clinics and hospitals providing clinical services to TB patients are needed to assess the local prevalence of HIV infection in TB patients and the consequent need for public health intervention to prevent further spread of HIV and TB infection. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in collaboration with State and local health departments, has initiated HIV surveillance of patients with confirmed and suspected TB in TB clinics and hospitals in the United States. Blinded (serologic test results not linked to identifiable persons) HIV seroprevalence surveys are conducted in sentinel TB clinics and hospitals that provide TB clinical services each year to obtain estimates of the level of HIV infection in TB patients and to follow trends in infection over time. Nonblinded (voluntary) surveys will also be conducted to evaluate behaviors that have placed TB patients at risk for or protected them against HIV infection. Data from these surveys will be used to target education and prevention and control programs for TB and HIV infection and to monitor changes in behavior in response to such programs.\r"

  ".W": "The U.S. sentinel hospital surveillance system for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection includes approximately 40 short-stay hospitals located in 31 metropolitan areas in the United States and Puerto Rico. Several hospitals began testing in late 1986, and additional sentinel hospitals have since been recruited. At each sentinel hospital, anonymous, unlinked testing for antibody to HIV is conducted monthly on 300 blood specimens, selected systematically and stratified by age of the patient. Specimens are excluded from patients whose reason for hospital visit on that occasion was for a medical condition associated with HIV infection or with risk factors for HIV infection, in order to limit the expected overrepresentation of HIV-infected persons among hospital patients compared with the general catchment population of the hospital. The incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in metropolitan areas with sentinel hospitals has been approximately twice the incidence of AIDS in the entire United States. However, while absolute levels of HIV seroprevalence should therefore be interpreted with caution, trends in the age-, sex-, and race-specific HIV seroprevalence at sentinel hospitals likely reflect trends in the communities served by the hospitals. Although concentrated in areas disproportionately affected by AIDS, sentinel hospitals will contribute seroprevalence data over time that reflect the impact of HIV infection across all age and behavioral risk groups. Sentinel hospitals will also constitute a key surveillance system to help integrate the age group-specific and risk group-specific findings from other activities in the CDC family of seroprevalence surveys.\r"

The blood donor population is ideal for detecting and quantifying uncommon or unrecognized modes of HIV transmission in the general population because persons at known risk for HIV infection are excluded from donating blood. The national HIV surveillance program consists of a centralized computer database of information on all donations at selected American Red Cross blood centers, which together account for about a quarter of the blood supply, and all donations at 20 regional blood centers where seropositive blood donors are interviewed to evaluate their risk factors for HIV infection and to determine their epidemiologic characteristics and motives for donation. Trends in HIV prevalence and incidence within specific demographic subgroups are determined for first-time and repeat donors. Combining the trends with HIV-risk profile data from seropositive donors provides a rate for HIV seropositive donors with no identified risk. Epidemiologic and behavioral data from seropositive donors will help in the development and evaluation of future donor deferral strategies.\r"

Because a broad cross section of the population seeks primary medical care, excess blood from specimens routinely collected for other purposes is available for anonymous, unlinked HIV testing, and all age groups and both sexes can be sampled. The CDC family of surveys includes two surveys of primary care outpatients: (a) a survey of 100,000 blood specimens per year submitted by more than 6,000 primary care physicians to a national diagnostic laboratory for complete blood count or hematocrit and (b) a survey of approximately 10,000 blood specimens per year from a network of 242 primary care physicians. Each survey has different advantages: the laboratory-based survey has a large sample from a large population base, and the physician network survey has a well-defined patient population in which each patient's clinical condition can be determined. In the primary care physician network, a concurrent study of clinical patterns of disease in patients with recognized HIV infection provides additional information on the clinical syndromes associated with HIV infection and estimates of the occurrence of unrecognized HIV infection.\r"

In prevention programs, seroprevalence data may be used in allocating resources, in determining the types and amount of education, counseling, and testing services offered, and in identifying access points for HIV-infected persons for medical followup and care. Over time, data will be useful in detecting and following trends in HIV infection and in evaluating the impact of program activities to prevent HIV infection. No single seroprevalence survey is representative of the entire population of a metropolitan area. Each type of survey has strengths and limitations that must be considered when interpreting seroprevalence data. However, results from the family of surveys are the best available data because they are relatively unaffected by self-selection bias, they are standardized, and the information is collected over time. Characterization of the population surveyed and adherence to standard CDC protocols improve the quality of the data. Consultants in health departments and at CDC form a network for providing technical support and disseminating data to health care providers and program managers.\r"

The impetus for developing this program came from the recognition of a need to assess the quality of existing and changing laboratory technology and to ensure that the quality of testing was sufficient to meet medical and public health needs. To develop the program, CDC chose HIV-1 antibody testing as the first specific application for assessing the quality of laboratory performance because (a) of the importance of accurate and reproducible test results for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) surveillance, prevention, and treatment programs; (b) HIV-1 testing technology is new to many laboratories; and (c) HIV-1 testing practices and applications continue to evolve. Unlike proficiency testing programs, the MPEP is not limited to assessing quality in the analytical step, alone. It will also assess quality in the preanalytical and postanalytical steps of the testing process, that is, from the time a test is requested until the clinician who ordered the test takes an action based on the test result. The participating laboratories furnish the information needed for the performance evaluation program by (a) completing questionnaires designed to describe HIV-1 testing laboratories and their testing practices, (b) analyzing specially prepared sample panels for HIV-1 antibody reactivity, and (c) reporting results to CDC.\r"

After the addresses of respondents and facilities were located on a grid-map and coded, the density of exercise facilities around each respondent's home address was computed. Subjects who reported engaging in three or more exercise sessions per week reported a statistically greater density of pay facilities near their homes than did those who reported no exercise sessions, after controlling for age, education, and income. The finding suggests an association between proximity of exercise facilities and frequency of exercise.\r"

The three areas were western New York, with a high density of toxic dump sites; Long Island, with a major shallow ground water aquifer; and the remainder of the State, excluding New York City, as a comparison area. The sampling list was obtained from records of licensed drivers of the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles. A 66 percent response rate was obtained to the mailed survey. As expected, most concerns were greater for western New York and Long Island, the two areas with highest threat potential for exposure or contamination, than for the comparison area. The single exception was that no regional differences were noted for concerns about environmental pollution and contamination. All concerns were associated with perceived distance between one's residence and a source of potential exposure. Regardless of region, women were more concerned than men about exposures, pollution, and related health effects. No sex differences, however, were noted for economic concerns.\r"

The surveys represent school children in the States of South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, and Alaska. This review describes and discusses the survey methods, prevalence, duration, and intensity of ST use, and ST health effects documented in these studies. Prevalence of regular ST use ranges from 18 percent in kindergartners through 6th graders to 55.9 percent among 9th and 10th graders. In two studies that surveyed kindergartners, regular use was reported at 13 percent in one study and 21 percent in the other. Comparisons to use by non-Native Americans, as reported in surveys, demonstrate the severity of the problem in Native American communities. There appear to be three significant findings related to Native American ST use: (a) young age of onset of ST use, (b) similar prevalence of use among adolescent boys and girls, and (c) higher overall prevalence of ST use when compared to non-Native American populations. Acceptance of the habit, peer pressure, and addiction seem to be contributing to the high ST use in Native American communities.\r"

In a 4-week period, 141 callers phoned in response to local publicity and completed a 30-minute anonymous interview. This paper focuses on 106 male respondents who were behaviorally defined as gay (that is, sex during the past year exclusively with partners of the same sex, N = 74) or bisexual (sex with both men and women, N = 32). The modal respondent was a never-married white male in his thirties who had some college education and was employed full-time in a white collar occupation. The gay men were more likely than the bisexual men to report that their family members and friends knew of their sexual orientation and to indicate that they were able to discuss their concerns about unsafe sex with someone close to them. Gay men were also more likely to use condoms and to have engaged in anonymous sex during the 3 months before the interview. More gay men had engaged in unprotected receptive anal intercourse (27 percent) than had bisexual men (13 percent), and in considerably more insertive anal intercourse (42 percent versus 22 percent). Of the gay men interviewed, 73 percent indicated that they needed help in changing their high-risk sexual behaviors compared with 61 percent of bisexuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In spite of high levels of in vivo resistance, no significant resistance was observed when the cells from these tumors were exposed to the drugs in vitro. The pharmacokinetics of CDDP and CTX were altered in animals bearing the respective resistant tumors. The resistance of all tumor lines except for the EMT-6/thiotepa decreased during 3 to 6 months in vivo passage in the absence of drugs. These results indicate that very high levels of resistance to anticancer drugs can develop through mechanisms that are expressed only in vivo.\r"

To determine which proteins are involved in storage of this memory, high-performance liquid chromatography was used to examine proteins from Hermissenda eyes. Conditioning-specific changes in four phosphoproteins were observed 24 hours after conditioning. One of these proteins, cp20, was purified to apparent homogeneity and found to be a G protein. When injected back into Hermissenda type B cells, cp20 reduced IK and IK-Ca in a manner indistinguishable from the reduction caused by conditioning, suggesting that this protein may play a crucial role in memory acquisition or retention.\r"

Upon occupation of a weak lysine binding site, the radius of gyration increases to 56 angstroms, an extremely large ligand-induced conformational change. There are no intermediate conformational states between the closed and open form. The conformational chang is not accompanied by a change in secondary structure, hence the closed conformation is formed by interaction between domains that is abolished upon conversion to the open form. This reversible change in conformation, in which the shape of the protein changes from that best described by a prolate ellipsoid to a flexible structure best described by a Debye random coil, is physiologically relevant because a weak lysine binding site regulates the activation of plasminogen.\r"

The rotational study bed (kinetic therapy) is designed to prevent complications of prolonged bed confinement by keeping patients in continuous slow rotation. The average number of acute care days was 11.2 in the study group and 16.4 in the control group. Study patients had similar costs per day for laboratory testing, x-ray studies, respiratory therapy, total acute care expenses, and total hospital expenses. Among study patients, reduction in medication costs per day did approach statistical significance, by unpaired t test, at P = .014, with a corrected significance level of .008. Overall, the average acute care costs per day were $544 in the study group verus $410 in the control group. This difference was approximately the average per day charge for the rotational bed ($130). We conclude that therapy designed to prevent complications of prolonged bed confinement is cost effective.\r"

Exaggerated or prolonged production of these proteins, however, may produce detrimental effects that lead to a poor outcome. Specific antagonists against cytokines offer potential therapy in these instances of aberrant cytokine response.\r"

Fifteen hemodynamically stable burn patients with burns on more than 20% of their body surface (39% +/- 12%) had their intestinal permeability measured within 24 hours of injury with use of the two nonmetabolizable sugars lactulose and mannitol as permeability markers. Lactulose absorption was fourfold higher in the patients (223 +/- 54 mumol) than in the controls (58 +/- 11 mumole; p less than 0.02), whereas the lactulose/mannitol ratio was threefold higher (5.2 vs 1.7; p less than 0.05). Thus intestinal permeability was increased in patients with moderate to major burn injuries shortly after injury.\r"

  ".W": "Ischemia and reperfusion lead to eicosanoid- and neutrophil (PMN)-dependent injury. This study tests the role of ischemia-induced lipoxygenase activity in mediating PMN activation and diapedesis. Anesthetized rabbits (n = 8) underwent 3 hours of bilateral hindlimb ischemia. At 10 minutes of reperfusion, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels in femoral venous effluent were 0.49 +/- 0.05 ng/ml compared with 0.04 +/- 0.07 ng/ml in sham-treated animals (n = 10) (p less than 0.05). Intracellular H2O2 production of circulating PMNs assayed flow cytometrically by dichlorofluorescein (DCF) oxidation, increased from a preischemic value of 74 +/- 14 femtomoles DCF/cell to 135 +/- 8 fmol DCF/cell (p less than 0.05). PMNs were treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), 10(-7) mol/L. In contrast to a 162% increase in H2O2 production before ischemia, PMNs at 10 minutes of reperfusion had an enhanced response to PMA of 336% (p less than 0.05). Addition of authentic LTB4 (0.5 ng/ml) to PMN from sham-treated animals led to their activation, manifest by an oxidative burst, 127 +/- 12 fmol DCF/cell, and an enhanced response of 337% to PMA stimulation. To study diapedesis, plasma collected at 10 minutes of reperfusion was introduced into plastic chambers taped atop skin abrasions in rabbits (n = 8). After 3 hours, 1610 +/- 246 PMN/mm3 accumulated and LTB4 levels in blister fluid were 0.83 +/- 0.03 ng/ml, higher than values of 44 +/- 23 PMN/mm3 (p less than 0.05) and 0.04 +/- 0.03 ng LTB4/ml (p less than 0.05) with saline solution and 68 +/- 16 PMN/mm3 (p less than 0.05) and 0.19 +/- 0.02 ng/ml (p less than 0.05) with nonischemic plasma. The introduction of LTB4, 3.3 ng/ml, into the chambers resulted in an accumulation of 536 +/- 352 PMN/mm3 (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment of animals before hindlimb ischemia (n = 5) with the lipoxygenase inhibitor diethylcarbamazine abolished PMN activation (51 +/- 12 fmol DCF/cell) and ischemic plasma-induced diapedesis into the plastic chamber (38 +/- 18 PMN/mm3). Pretreatment of nonischemic animals (n = 13) used for the dermabrasion bioassay with diethylcarbamazine abolished diapedesis into the plastic chambers induced by ischemic plasma (n = 5) (32 +/- 24 PMN/mm3) or LTB4 (n = 3) (36 +/- 28 PMN/mm3). These data indicate that PMN activation after reperfusion of ischemic tissue is mediated by a lipoxygenase product, perhaps LTB4, and that both reperfusion plasma and authentic LTB4 induce diapedesis by stimulating de novo lipoxygenase activity.\r"

The detrimental effects of protein malnutrition could be completely reversed for abdominal wall wounds and partially reversed for colonic anastomoses in rats on a low-protein diet given postoperative parenteral nutrition (group C). Autoradiographic studies showed a marked decrease in the activity of wound fibroblasts that was restored by the administration of postoperative parenteral nutrition.

The initial treatment was given for three months and the second for two months. Because almitrine had an unexpectedly prolonged washout effect crossover analysis could not be performed; data from the placebo treatment administered in the second arm of the trial were used to calculate the half life of almitrine. Nine patients were withdrawn from the study (5 almitrine, 4 placebo). Patients' tolerance of the drug was good. The estimated plasma half life of almitrine was 20.5 days, considerably longer than previously reported. Almitrine caused a significant improvement in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) with a mean maximum increase of 0.7 kPa at a plasma concentration of 500 ng/ml. Higher plasma concentrations were not associated with any further increase in PaO2. There was no significant effect on arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2). In a second, acute study at the end of each arm of the chronic trial nine patients were subjected to increasing oxygen delivery rates (2, 4, and 6 l/min) for 90 minutes or until blood gas concentrations plateaued. Almitrine increased PaO2 in a dose dependent fashion at all delivery rates, but the effect diminished as PaO2 approached normoxic levels. There was no significant effect on PaCO2. Almitrine treatment results in a significant improvement in PaO2 over that achieved by oxygen alone, an effect that diminishes at high flow rates. Whether this is of clinical benefit is not known. In view of the prolonged half life revised dosage schedules are required.\r"

To assess the effect of increased GABA concentrations in the brain on human respiration we measured the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide in seven normal subjects after they had taken vigabatrin or placebo for three days in a double blind crossover study. There was no change in either the slope or the intercept of the curve of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide after vigabatrin by comparison with placebo. This study suggests that GABA does not have an important role in the control of respiration in normal individuals.\r"

Short-term follow-up of up to 2 weeks was available in all patients. In 63 patients, long-term follow-up (greater than 4 weeks; average, 3.5 months; maximum, 1 year) was available. Catheter placement was successful in 124 (99%) of 125 patients, including three patients with anatomic changes after Bilroth II hemigastrectomy and two patients with failed endoscopic attempts. There were no deaths related to the procedure, and no patients required surgical intervention for complications attributable to the gastrostomy procedure. The 30-day mortality rate was 11% (n = 7). These deaths were due to cardiorespiratory arrest and were not attributable to the gastrostomy procedure. Major complications occurred in 1.6% (n = 1) and minor complications in 9.5% (n = 6). These results indicate that percutaneous gastrostomy with gastropexy is a safe and effective technique for placement of catheters in the stomach.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of radiologic intervention in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome is to control portal hypertension and prevent further hepatocellular damage until collateral hepatic venous outflow channels can develop. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty was used to treat six patients with this syndrome who were followed up for an average of 43 months (range, 12-92 months). Standard interventional radiologic techniques were used to dilate the hepatic veins (two patients), inferior vena cava (three patients), and proximal anastomosis of a mesoatrial shunt (one patient). Angioplasty was the only invasive treatment in three patients, whereas the remaining three patients had previous portosystemic shunts. Clinical and hemodynamic improvement occurred after each angioplasty. Multiple dilatations were required in all patients (average, 3.2; range, 2-5) because of restenosis at the angioplasty site and ongoing hepatocyte necrosis shown by biopsy. Long-term benefit occurred in five patients despite ultimate caval occlusion in two patients and restenosis in one patient. One patient who was almost free of symptoms for 36 months developed gastrointestinal bleeding caused by portal hypertension. This experience suggests that balloon angioplasty is a safe and effective treatment for patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome. The therapy is not definitive, but serves to moderate the severity of the disease until collateral venous pathways develop. Multiple angioplasties are required for the long-term care of these patients.\r"

In the postoperative period, the scans from 15 patients revealed seven transient fluid collections; four deep abscesses, three of which were successfully drained under CT guidance; three superficial abscesses; and five cases of ascites. In 19 patients, CT scans were obtained up to 4 years after surgery to search for recurrent tumor. The most frequent site of recurrence was the liver. CT correctly identified liver metastases in six of seven patients and was falsely positive in one. Recurrence also was found twice in retroperitoneal lymph nodes; one time each in the mesenteric root, spleen, and lung base; and twice causing afferent loop blockage. Surgical proof of recurrence was obtained in eight cases. Our experience suggests that an understanding of the normal postoperative anatomy following the Whipple procedure is essential in evaluating postoperative CT scans. Scans obtained for detection of tumor recurrence should be optimized for imaging the liver because this was the most frequent site of recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "Thirteen patients with 15 ankle fractures potentially requiring surgical reduction according to plain film criteria were studied with transaxial CT, from which static and animated interactive two-dimensional (2-D) images and animated volumetric three-dimensional (3-D) images were generated. CT criteria believed to parallel well-accepted plain film criteria for triage of ankle fractures were developed and applied. The tibiofibular, talofibular, and tibiotalar articulations were characterized and, where possible (nine cases), compared with the (presumably normal) contralateral ankle. Talocrural angle measurements were made on interactive coronal measurements and compared with standard plain film measurements. Fracture fragment displacement, rotation, and impaction were noted. Posterior tibial lip disruption was quantified. Information derived from the 2-D/3-D CT study led to cancellation of proposed surgery in three of the distal fibular fractures and in two distal tibial fractures. There was far less variation than anticipated between the talocrural angles of the injured and normal ankles, and both injured and normal ankles deviated significantly from the accepted standard of 84 degrees. Displacement at the level of the fibular fracture was a poor predictor of more distal disruption. Two-dimensional CT was found to provide anatomic detail and information superior to either plain film or 3-D CT; 3-D CT was preferred by the surgeons for final surgical planning and for integration of the 2-D data. CT altered management in five of the 13 patients studied, supporting our belief that 2-D/3-D CT can be of significant value in assessing ankle fractures.\r"

We retrospectively analyzed the radiographs and clinical records in seven osteopenic patients with sternal insufficiency fractures and correlated the type of insufficiency fracture with the presence and degree of dorsal kyphosis, as well as the presence of chest pain, soft-tissue mass, and osteolysis. We found that displaced or nondisplaced nonbuckling fractures (five patients) may be associated with chest pain localized to the sternum (three patients), and may be present with (three patients) or without (two patients) associated thoracic kyphosis. This type of insufficiency fracture also may be accompanied by a soft-tissue mass and osteolysis (three patients), findings simulating pathologic fractures. All buckling insufficiency fractures (two patients) were associated with thoracic kyphosis and were asymptomatic. Our findings suggest that sternal insufficiency fractures may occur with or without exaggerated dorsal kyphosis. The fractures are an uncommon complication of osteopenia and may resemble pathologic fractures when osteolysis and soft-tissue swelling are present.\r"

  ".U": "90209773\r", 
  ".W": "A rat model of cerebral hemorrhage using stereotaxic injection of blood into the right basal ganglia was developed to investigate the influence of iron metabolism on the appearance of cerebral hemorrhage on MR images. Images of in vitro fixed brain sections stained specifically for different iron-storage substances, ferritin and hemosiderin, created by digitization of the pathology sections using an Eikonix CCD camera, were compared with the in vivo MR images of late-phase hematomas. Areas of the pathologic and MR features of the lesions were quantitatively correlated. The single-slice MR images were obtained with the use of T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo pulse sequences, as well as T2-weighted spin-echo pulse sequences in which the 180 degrees refocusing pulse was offset from the center of the echo time; this was termed an asymmetric spin-echo pulse sequence. The symmetric and asymmetric T2-weighted images allowed the calculation of line-width images, which emphasize line broadening from intravoxel magnetic field inhomogeneities that arise from the presence of iron-containing substances. From biochemical and histochemical staining, we conclude that at least two iron-storage substances are present in the late phase of resolving cerebral hematomas. Ferritin has a wider distribution than hemosiderin, showing a similar distribution to the MR signal changes of the calculated line-width images. Line-width mapping is a sensitive means of detecting magnetic field inhomogeneities caused by the magnetic susceptibility differences introduced by the aggregation of these iron-storage substances.\r"

  ".U": "90209774\r", 
  ".W": "Carotid artery disease was assessed in 180 patients by means of color Doppler flow imaging. Color Doppler findings in 360 carotid arteries were compared with the results of standard Doppler sonography, and color Doppler findings in 60 bifurcations were compared with the results of intraarterial angiography. The sensitivity of color Doppler for the detection of carotid disease was 100% when compared with angiography. The accuracy of color Doppler in classifying minor (40-60%), moderate (61-80%), and severe (81-90%) stenosis ranged from 91.3% to 97.8% vs standard Doppler sonography, and from 91.7% to 95.8% vs angiography. Whereas all occlusions were identified correctly by both color Doppler and angiography, four pseudoocclusions of the carotid artery were misdiagnosed as occluded. Characteristic features providing reliable criteria of the degree of stenosis are (1) intensity, extent, and duration of color fading; (2) postprocessed systolic peak frequency; (3) plaque extent on serial sonograms; and (4) poststenotic flow patterns. Display of hemodynamic disturbances induced by less pronounced plaques showed highly variable patterns that could not be anticipated from the plaque morphology alone. Thus, color Doppler preserves the advantages of standard Doppler and duplex sonography but provides additional information about otherwise anechoic necrotic and thrombotic material that often causes cerebral embolisms. With atherogenesis, repair mechanisms may be sustained or progression be stopped by reducing the risk factors and instituting medical treatment; thus, the application of this noninvasive technique is important.\r"

  ".W": "Routine evaluation of axial MR images of the cervical spine with high-intensity CSF (long TR/TE spin-echo or gradient-echo images) revealed apparent narrowing of the cord's anteroposterior diameter when these images were compared with corresponding postmyelography CT scans. This discrepancy was believed to be due to the truncation artifact at the CSF-cord boundary. To examine the truncation effect, we compared cord diameters in 12 patients on postmyelography CT scans and MR images and then compared these with MR scans of normal volunteers and of an agar-saline spine phantom. There was an artifactual diminution of the cord diameter in the 128-step phase-encoding axis of the 128 x 256-matrix MR scan as compared with the diameter of the cord in the patients' postiohexol CT scans and in the 256 phase-encoded axis MR scan in the volunteer study. A similar discrepancy was noted in the spine phantom study, in which the cord diameter in the 256-step phase-encoded MR scan, the CT scan, and direct measurement exceeded that in the 128-step phase-encoded axis MR scan. The range of differences between the measurements was as large as 2.3 mm (patients), 1.7 mm (volunteers), and 1.8 mm (phantom) for the three studies. In all three studies, varying the photographic window width and level produced variation in the apparent cord diameter of up to 1.5 mm. To eliminate this effect, the cord diameters in the phantom and the normal control subjects were measured at identical window levels. The truncation artifact, coupled with standard window settings used in photography, may lead to inaccurate display of the diameter of the cervical spinal cord.\r"

  ".W": "The early diagnosis of acromegaly may be difficult when serum levels of growth hormone are minimally elevated and imaging of the pituitary gland fails to show an adenoma. However, transsphenoidal surgery has the greatest chance of cure at this stage. We therefore investigated the value of sampling petrosal sinuses for measurement of growth hormone in this group of patients. Simultaneous bilateral sampling of the inferior petrosal sinuses to measure serum concentrations of growth hormone was performed in five patients suspected of having acromegaly but with nondiagnostic CT scans (n = 5) and MR images (n = 3) of the pituitary gland. Levels of growth hormone from the petrosal sinuses were five to 36 times greater than levels in the peripheral veins in all five patients, and three of four showed a marked response to growth hormone-releasing hormone. During transsphenoidal surgery, growth hormone-producing microadenomas were resected completely in four patients. In the fifth patient, a left-sided microadenoma had invaded the cavernous sinus and could not be resected completely. Lateralization of the adenomas within the pituitary gland on the basis of differences in levels of growth hormone between the two petrosal sinuses was not completely reliable. Elevated levels of growth hormone in selective samples from the inferior petrosal sinuses can help support an early diagnosis of acromegaly when peripheral growth hormone levels and imaging are not diagnostic.\r"

The carcinoma appeared as a large mass of low attenuation accompanied by dense calcification in 58% of the patients; there was necrosis in 74%. Often, adjacent structures were infiltrated. CT correctly showed tumor invasion of the carotid artery (7/7), internal jugular vein (9/10), larynx (5/6), trachea (8/10), esophagus (4/5), mediastinum (5/5), and regional lymph nodes (14/16). Seven patients (50%) had necrotic nodes. CT was superior to palpation in the detection of a primary tumor in one patient and of metastatic nodes in seven patients. It suggested a suitable place for biopsy in two patients, leading to a correct diagnosis. CT altered surgical planning in five patients with intrathoracic extension of the thyroid tumor, and in three patients with laryngeal or esophageal invasion of the tumor. CT can increase diagnostic accuracy in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma by suggesting a likely diagnosis and by indicating an appropriate site for biopsy. It is indispensable in the planning of surgery for patients with this disorder.\r"

The patients were all selected for nonoperative chemical parathyroid ablation either because of acute severe hypercalcemic symptoms (four patients), a high surgical risk or an advanced age (four patients), or refusal of a surgical intervention (four patients). Before treatment, the serum concentration of ionized calcium ranged from 1.38 to 2.39 mmol/l (median, 1.59 mmol/l), and after the last treatment the serum concentration ranged from 0.80 to 1.47 mmol/l (median, 1.32 mmol/l) (p less than .001). Normocalcemia was achieved in eight patients, and evident clinical improvement was seen in seven patients. The only complication was a permanent unilateral vocal cord paralysis due to involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The present study confirms the possibility of percutaneous treatment of hyperactive parathyroid glands. However, the treatment was not found to be beneficial to all patients and hypercalcemia recurred. On the basis of our experience with these patients, we conclude that sonographically guided chemical parathyroidectomy should be considered an alternative treatment to surgery in patients who are not suited for surgical intervention.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we evaluated methods for reducing high-flow jets from 5-French catheters that occur when injection pressures approach catheter tolerance (1000 psi [6.9 MPa]). This \"jet effect\" has been responsible for subintimal extravasation of contrast material in patients. We designed a physical model that accurately measures flow rates through the end hole and each side hole of 5-French high-flow catheters under simulated physiologic arterial pressure. When a standard catheter commonly used for injection of contrast material was studied, flow of contrast material was 34% through the end hole and 31% through the distal side-hole pair at high injection pressures (1000 psi). We examined the effect of altering the size and configuration of catheter side holes and end hole in an effort to create an improved flow profile, and thus a safer angiographic catheter. End-hole flow rate was reduced by 73% to 9% of total flow by tapering the 5-French catheter to 0.018 in. (0.046 cm) and by using smaller 0.015-in. (0.038-cm) side holes for even flow distribution. The high-flow jets present with standard high-flow 5-French catheters do not occur when flow-restrictive end holes and side holes are used. A uniform flow profile can be obtained without sacrificing delivery of contrast material through small catheters.\r"

  ".W": "The image quality of radiographs developed by a new ultrarapid processor was evaluated to determine if faster processing causes degradation in the image. The processor used was the Konica Super-Rapid SRX-501 model. Two films designed for this processor (Konica MGH-SR and MGL-SR) were processed in 45 sec and were compared with standard rapid processing in 90 sec of corresponding conventional films (Kodak TMG and OC). Rare-earth screens (Kodak Lanex Regular and Lanex Medium) used with the new and conventional films interleaved during angiographic studies or for phantom images were assessed for image quality. The basic imaging properties of the screen-film systems were examined by measuring (1) Hurter and Driffield curves, (2) modulation transfer functions by using the slit method, and (3) noise Wiener spectra. Subjective clinical assessment showed that the images obtained with ultrarapid processing were acceptable, with increased contrast and graininess. Hurter and Driffield curve measurements confirmed higher gradients. Modulation transfer function measurements were the same as for the conventional films. Noise Wiener spectrum measurements showed a 10% increase in noise for MGH-SR vs TMG film and a 30% increase for MGL-SR vs OC film. We conclude that acceptable image quality can be obtained using ultrarapid processing, with processing time approximately 60% that of conventional rapid processing. Potential applications include all areas in which rapid availability of the radiograph for interpretation is important. Although the processor studied was the first of its kind available, our evaluation indicates that the technology is available for a new class of ultrarapid processors.\r"

Segmental findings on 99mTc perfusion and aerosol ventilation scans, chest radiographs, and pulmonary angiograms obtained within 48 hr of each other were encoded along with other information into a data base to facilitate analysis. The McNeil, Biello, and PIOPED criteria were applied to the encoded data. Although the PIOPED set of criteria yielded the most favorable likelihood ratio for predicting an angiogram showing pulmonary emboli and a favorable likelihood ratio for predicting an angiogram not showing pulmonary emboli, it had the highest number of indeterminate studies. The McNeil criteria demonstrated the least favorable likelihood for predicting pulmonary emboli on an angiogram. The Biello and McNeil criteria showed the most favorable likelihood ratio for predicting an angiogram not showing pulmonary emboli. Analysis of receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves yielded the greatest area under the ROC curve for the Biello criteria, but there were no statistically significant differences among the three sets of criteria. This study suggests that the Biello scheme represents the best compromise of the sets of criteria studied.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed the chest radiographs, CT scans, and biopsy specimens in 14 consecutive patients with proved bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. Six patients were immunocompromised because of leukemia or bone-marrow transplantation. In all patients, 10-mm collimation CT scans were available. In 11 of the 14 patients, select 1.5-mm scans were obtained. The CT findings included patchy unilateral (n = 1) or bilateral air-space consolidation (n = 9), small nodular opacities (n = 7), irregular linear opacities (n = 2), bronchial wall thickening and dilatation (n = 6), and small pleural effusions (n = 4). All patients had areas of air-space consolidation, small nodules, or both. A predominantly subpleural distribution of the air-space consolidation was apparent on the radiographs of two patients and on CT scans of six. Pathologically, the nodules and the consolidation represented different degrees of inflammation in bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. Although most of the findings were apparent on the radiographs, the CT scans depicted the anatomic distribution and extent of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia more accurately than did the plain chest radiographs.\r"

The condition (either in the form of necrotizing fasciitis and/or pyomyositis) is difficult to diagnose clinically because of poor localizing signs. Prognosis depends on early recognition, extent of disease, and type of causative organism. Pathologically, the infections can manifest as cellulitis, abscess, and/or granulation tissue formation. To determine the value of MR imaging in the assessment of these infections, we compared the findings of MR with those of CT, sonography, scintigraphy, and plain radiography in 13 patients with proved thoracic and/or abdominal wall infection. The imaging findings were correlated with microbiological, pathologic, and/or surgical data. The isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 4), and Streptomyces somaliensis (n = 2). In 10 of 13 patients, MR imaging and CT were comparable and proved accurate in detecting the nature and extent of the inflammatory process. In seven of the patients, CT also was useful in guiding percutaneous biopsy and/or partial drainage procedures. Coronal and sagittal MR images were helpful for planning surgery. Rib osteomyelitis was missed with both techniques in one patient; in two other patients who did not have CT, MR imaging missed osteomyelitis of the ribs, the spinous process of a vertebral body, and the iliac bone. Sonography underestimated the extent of the disease in all 13 patients, but detected fluid collections in six. Findings on scintigraphy and plain radiography were the least contributory to the diagnosis and treatment of these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients were treated with 100 to 150 mg of t-PA intravenously over 6 to 8 hours, and coronary angiography was performed within 90 minutes of initiation of therapy. In 197 patients with suitable anatomic characteristics, angioplasty was either performed immediately or was deferred for 7 to 10 days on a randomized basis. The remainder of the patients were treated as considered clinically appropriate. The in-hospital mortality rate was 7%, and only 1.9% of patients died in the first year after discharge from the hospital; three patients died of cardiac events and four died of noncardiac causes. Ninety-four percent of patients discharged alive from the hospital remained alive and had no myocardial infarctions during the first 12 posthospital months. Revascularization procedures after discharge from the hospital included angioplasty in 8% of patients and coronary artery bypass grafting in 5%. The high survival rates were evident in high-risk groups defined by age, ejection fraction, and extent of coronary artery disease. At 1-year follow-up 64% of patients less than 65 years of age were employed and only 10% reported that they were disabled; 94% of patients were in Canadian Heart Association class I or II. These low rates of follow-up events suggest a change in the \"natural history\" of the first year after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Inhibition of coronary prostaglandin biosynthesis by ketoprofen (1 mg/kg) or aspirin (15 mg/kg) administered intravenously did not significantly change coronary hemodynamics in resting conditions. In all patients cold pressor tests induced significant increases in coronary blood flow (p less than 0.001) and decreases in coronary vascular resistance (p less than 0.001) without changes in cardiac oxygen extraction and with consequent increases in calculated myocardial oxygen consumption. Simultaneously, a marked increase in coronary PGI2 (as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and PGE2 formation was observed (p less than 0.001). Both ketoprofen (1 mg/kg) and aspirin (15 mg/kg) administration completely abolished PGI2 and PGE2 formation that was induced by cold pressor test and caused a paradoxical increase in coronary vascular resistance (ketoprofen: p less than 0.02; aspirin: p less than 0.05). The results of this study support a physiologic role for the coronary prostaglandins in modulating coronary vascular response to sympathetic stimulation in nonischemic patients.\r"

  ".W": "To study the relation between plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and cardiac pressure, and to assess the pathophysiologic significance of ANP in water and electrolyte metabolism, the changes in plasma levels of ANP and arginine vasopressin (AVP) were examined in 11 patients with mitral stenosis who underwent percutaneous transvenous mitral valvuloplasty, and compared with the changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and renal function. Immediately after valvuloplasty, plasma ANP levels decreased significantly with a concomitant decrease in mean pressures in the left atrium, the pulmonary artery and the right atrium. Plasma ANP levels decreased to the normal range in 4 of the 6 patients with normal sinus rhythm, while all 5 patients with atrial fibrillation had higher levels despite a similar degree of decrease in atrial pressure. There were significant positive correlations between plasma ANP levels and the mean left atrial pressure (r = 0.61, p less than 0.01), the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (r = 0.49, p less than 0.01) and the mean right atrial pressure (r = 0.54, p less than 0.01). The mean plasma AVP levels, on the other hand, showed a transient increase after valvuloplasty from 0.5 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.4 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). The mean plasma renin activity (1.3 +/- 0.3 vs 2.7 +/- 0.8 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.05) and plasma aldosterone concentration (8.6 +/- 2.3 vs 17.2 +/- 5.2 ng/dl, p less than 0.05) also increased significantly 30 minutes after valvuloplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy included ischemic heart disease (33%), idiopathic (42%) and miscellaneous (25%). In each patient, 26 parameters were recorded. Whole group survival was 68% at 1 year, 56% at 2 years, 41% at 3 years and 25% at 4 years. On Cox multivariate regression analysis, 3 parameters predicted survival: New York Heart Association symptom class (p less than 0.0001), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p less than 0.008) and plasma atrial natriuretic factor level (p less than 0.002). On paired testing of actuarial survival curves, plasma noradrenaline also held predictive value (p less than 0.002), as did left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 20% on radionuclide ventriculography (p = 0.007) and presence of greater than or equal to 4 beats of ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring (p = 0.007). Treatment with amiodarone did not appear to influence survival. Conventional determinants of prognosis in cardiomyopathy (symptom class, wedge pressure, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and ejection fraction) do not alone always adequately differentiate survival in this group of high risk patients. More attention to plasma noradrenaline and to atrial natriuretic factor levels may give important additional information in the context of assessment of patients for transplantation.\r"

There are no available measurements of MEE for severely burned infants and toddlers, however, and nutritional support relies on published estimates of MEE that range from 200% to 400% of RMR. We determined the actual calories provided to 10 infants and children ages 3-33 mo during acute care for severe burns (59 +/- 5% total-body-surface burn). Our standard protocol emphasizes the delivery of amino acids at 3 g.kg-1.d-1 in conjunction with prompt excision and grafting. An anabolic state characterized by weight maintenance and healing was supported with far fewer calories than predicted by four published formulas for MEE. We conclude that when greater than 2.5 g.kg-1.d-1 protein is provided, efficient protein utilization for recovery is achieved with calorie provision at 120-200% RMR in severely burned infants and toddlers.\r"

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced in the colon by the fermentation of dietary carbohydrates and fiber polysaccharides and have been shown to stimulate mucosal-cell mitotic activity in the intestine. This study compared the effects of an intravenous and an intracecal infusion of SCFAs on the small-bowel mucosa. Rats received standard TPN, TPN with SCFAs (sodium acetate, propionate, and butyrate), TPN with an intracecal infusion of SCFAs, or rat food. After 7 d jejunal and ileal mucosal weights, DNA, RNA, and protein were determined. Standard TPN produced significant atrophy of the jejunal and ileal mucosa. Both the intracecal and intravenous infusion of SCFAs significantly reduced the mucosal atrophy associated with TPN. The intravenous and intracolonic infusion of SCFAs were equally effective in inhibiting small-bowel mucosal atrophy.\r"

We found fecapentaene in all the stool samples of adults on typical high-fat, low-fiber Western diets. These fecapentaene concentrations remained largely constant when subjects consumed constant diets. Fecapentaene concentrations were reduced for total-parenteral-nutrition (TPN) patients with severe intestinal malabsorption. This finding with TPN patients may reflect changes in important variables of gut microflora in fecapentaene production. Studies with newborns and children showed that fecapentaenes appeared very early in life but are not present in stool at birth.\r"

The lack of lineage specificity of immunoglobulin heavy chain and T-cell receptor beta and gamma gene probes in acute leukemia is well established. However, immunoglobulin light chain gene rearrangement traditionally has been considered a highly specific indicator of a clonal B-lineage process. The authors describe a case of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in which Southern blot hybridization studies showed rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta chain gene. Unexpectedly, the immunoglobulin kappa light chain gene also was rearranged; no immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement was seen. Kappa rearrangement was confirmed with the use of three restriction endonucleases. No rearrangements were seen from normal skin tissue, making a restriction enzyme site polymorphism highly unlikely. Northern blot studies showed a normal-size, T-cell receptor beta chain gene transcript; no immunoglobulin RNA was identified. These results describe the first reported case of kappa light chain gene rearrangement in a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The findings emphasize the necessity of interpreting molecular hybridization studies in conjunction with routine morphology and immunophenotyping studies.\r"

Stenosing vascular lesions as complications of neurofibromatosis were first reported in 1945. They are being increasingly recognized and most commonly involve the renal artery. Renal artery stenosis (usually proximal), intraparenchymal renal arterial abnormalities, and coarctation of the abdominal aorta often lead to hypertension. However, despite reports of bilateral and severe renal artery disease, renal infarction and resulting renal insufficiency have not been described. We present the case of a 35-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis and chronic hypertension associated with narrowing of right intrarenal arteries. The patient had two separate episodes of left renal infarction documented clinically and radiographically. The second infarct resulted in renal insufficieny. There was no hypercoagulopathy or source for embolism. This case suggests that renal infarction and renal insufficiency are additional complications of neurofibromatosis.\r"

The clinical course was characterized by persistence of physical signs over at least 3.4 years in one patient, fluctuation in another, and marked regression in two.

  ".W": "Left ventricular dilation and remodelling occur in 35-40% of anterior transmural myocardial infarcts and these events are important antecedents to the development of late congestive heart failure. This process commences within the first 24 hours following myocardial infarction and may be steadily progressive over months to years. Both the infarcted and the uninfarcted regions of myocardium are equally involved in the process. Thinning of the left ventricular wall occurs mainly as a result of cell slippage. In addition, compensatory hypertrophy occurs in the uninfarcted segment of the myocardium. While this hypertrophy may initially be physiological, it ultimately appears to become a pathological process and thereby contributes to pump dysfunction. At the present time there are encouraging data to suggest that nitroglycerin, administered in the setting of the acute infarction, or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, may ameliorate this process. Whether a patent infarct related artery further limits dilation is uncertain and is currently under investigation.\r"

After a standardized oral challenge with cow milk, serum beta-lactoglobulin was increased above control values in three patients. This finding did not correlate with response to hypoallergenic diet or treatment with disodium cromoglycate for 3 weeks. However over 50% of patients improved after diet with and without DSCG (2/5 on diet only and 5/7 with disodium cromoglycate of 12 evaluable cases). Since only two patients had elevated serum IgE levels, our results suggest that intolerance rather than hypersensitivity to foods may play a role in the disease. The tests we used to identify immunologic mechanisms could not predict which patients would do better on the diet and/or the drug.\r"

The two types of genetic C1 inh deficiency are type I, which is quantitative, and type II, which is functional. For the purpose of the present study, four HAE patients were selected. None of them had received any androgenic therapy. The group included three type I and one type II cases. All patients that entered the protocol received danazol, 400 mg/day for 14 days. The complement system was evaluated by monitoring C4, hemolytic complement 50% (CH50), circulating immune complexes (CIC), and antigenic and functional C1 inh during the study. The level of complement factors at the beginning and at the end of this period demonstrated a statistically significant increase in C4 and CH50 and the disappearance of CIC, while C1 inh remained unmodified. These results suggest that the therapeutic effect of danazol may have two mechanisms of action: (1) promotion of C4 synthesis by anabolic effect resulting in an improvement of the complement system with the disappearance of CIC and (2) a minor increase in C1 inh level primarily due to the lack of its consumption.\r"

After five minutes of CPR, epinephrine 0.045 mg/kg IV was administered. CPP and ETCO2 were compared immediately before and two minutes after epinephrine administration. There was a significant increase in CPP from 12.2 +/- 9.6 to 26.8 +/- 7.1 mm Hg (P = .006) after epinephrine. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in ETCO2 from 8.2 +/- 2.9 to 3.8 +/- 2.0 mm Hg (P = .01).

Light and electron microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations showed an intercellular precipitation and massive accumulation of the IgG dysprotein and cryoglobulin between the keratinocytes of the upper epidermis and the infundibular epithelium. The follicles were dilated and filled with parakeratotic cells, the protein deposits between them and a rudimentary hair thus resulting in the clinically visible symptoms of horny spicules. The limitation or the predominance of the symptoms in cold-exposed body regions, the morphological identification of the dysprotein deposits as cryoglobulin or cryogel, and the laboratory findings concerning the temperature and pH dependence of the precipitation of the IgG dysprotein reveal that the paraneoplastic horny spicules are a hitherto unknown clinical manifestation of cryoglobulinemia.\r"

Infection complicating thermal injury may also affect the intestine producing bowel atrophy. To study these relationships, Wistar rats received either 30% scald followed by wound inoculation with Pseudomonas; 30% scald with pair feeding to infected animals; or sham injury as controls. On days 1, 4, and 7 after injury animals were killed with examination of the bowel and culture of the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), livers, spleens, and blood. All burned animals demonstrated BT to the MLN on day 1 after injury, but only burn-infected animals had continued BT on days 4 and 7, with progression of BT to the abdominal organs and blood. Burn injury and infection also resulted in significant atrophy of small bowel mucosa temporally associated with continued BT. Thus injury complicated by infection results in prolonged and enhanced bacterial translocation, perhaps due to failure to maintain the mucosal barrier.\r"

The effect of TNF on testicular function was determined in a series of studies in which rhTNF (0, 2, and 4 X 10(5) units/kg/24 hours) was administered by continuous infusion to male Wistar rats maintained on total parenteral nutrition adequate for growing rats. Testicular weight and histology, and plasma luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone levels were determined at 1, 3, and 6 days. Testicular weight decreased within 24 hours and this was associated with a fall in plasma testosterone and increased LH and FSH levels. These changes persisted for 6 days, indicating a loss of testosterone-mediated negative feedback on gonadotropin release. Histologic examination demonstrated significant damage to the germ cells in the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium; extensive exfoliation of spermatocytes and spermatids occurred at day six. However the primary spermatogonia in the basal compartment were relatively spared. Damage to the seminiferous epithelium at earlier times was noted in some tubules. The decrease in testosterone concentration and increase in gonadotropin levels suggest that TNF interferes with Leydig cell function. Germ cell damage may be a direct effect of TNF on these cells or may occur through secondary mechanisms involving Leydig or Sertoli cell dysfunction.\r"

Saline solution was infused into the pericardial space in 6 anesthetized pigs until a predetermined decrease of 20% in mean arterial pressure was achieved. Another 6 sham-treated pigs served as controls. Tamponade increased atrial intracavitary pressures but decreased atrial transmural (distending) pressures. These changes in atrial pressures were reversed after release of tamponade. Changes in plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration correlated positively with changes in atrial transmural pressures. Tamponade increased plasma renin activity and decreased urine flow and renal sodium and potassium excretion, and release of tamponade reversed these changes. Thus, the tamponade-induced reduction in atrial distention is associated with hormonal changes, which may contribute to the reductions in diuresis and natriuresis observed in this connection.\r"

The depressed patients exhibited a significant elevation in the plasma concentration (+/- SEM) of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (79.6 +/- 4 mg/dL) when compared with the age- and sex-matched controls (61.7 +/- 3 mg/dL). Fourteen of the 51 patients with major depression had plasma alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations that were higher than the highest values of the normal controls. There was no relationship between plasma alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations and sex or affinity of platelet tritiated imipramine binding of either the normal volunteers or the depressed patients. In the depressed patients, there was a significant positive correlation between plasma concentrations of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and postdexamethasone plasma cortisol concentrations, and two measures of depression severity, the Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale for Depression and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, and a significant negative correlation with age.

Antiserum to sodium-potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase bound to the basolateral but not the apical plasmalemma of columnar epithelial cells. Staining was most intense in the superficial cells, which also contained carbonic anhydrase, but was also evident to a lesser degree in cells deep in the crypts. Adenomas and adenocarcinomas failed to stain for content of carbonic anhydrase but retained basolateral sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase positivity. The staining characteristics of colonic neoplasms for the two enzymes involved in the transport function of colonic epithelium thus resembled those of the less mature cells lining the base of normal crypts.\r"

In the late period, E coli was associated with significantly greater lung microvascular damage compared with S faecalis. The lack of difference between groups with respect to complement activation suggests the action of chemotactic factors, in addition to complement, mediating granulocyte aggregation, and neutropenia. In this model, S faecalis demonstrated limited pathogenicity as expressed in lung microvascular injury compared with E coli.\r"

Animals received either no treatment, cefoxitin, recombinant rat INF-gamma, recombinant human TNF-alpha, or cefoxitin/cytokine combinations. Cefoxitin reduced abscess size by 57% in animals without shock but only by 26% after shock. Although neither INF-gamma nor TNF-alpha alone had a salutary effect when given with cefoxitin in animals after shock, INF-gamma and TNF-alpha reduced abscess size by 50% and 55%, respectively. These results suggest that INF-gamma and TNF-alpha may be useful to reduce the severity of mixed gram-negative infections after shock with bacterial contamination.\r"

However, the mechanism by which vagotomy affects prostaglandin generation remains unknown. In this study we compared vagotomy with long-term acid suppression using anticholinergic (atropine sulfate) or histamine2-receptor antagonism (cimetidine) and assessed mucosal injury and prostaglandin generation during graded stress. Vagotomy correlated with decreases in injury only in severe stress, while both atropine and cimetidine decreased injury also during moderate stress. Prostaglandin generation decreased in all groups during severe stress. Compared with sham operation, vagotomy, atropine, and cimetidine were all associated with increased mucosal prostaglandin generation in all stress periods. During severe stress, both atropine and cimetidine also evidenced higher prostaglandin generation than did vagotomy. These results suggest that vagotomy primarily decreases acid secretion, which then secondarily results in increased mucosal generation.\r"

  ".W": "Evoked potentials were studied in a patient with a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy revealing a defect of nicotinamideadenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase and cytochrome C oxidase in the mitochondria of a muscle biopsy specimen. The biopsy specimen showed myopathic changes with ragged-red fibers and markedly decreased cytochrome C oxidase in the muscle fibers. Subcortical somatosensory evoked potentials to median nerve stimulation were normal in the peak latencies of N9, N11, and N13. Cortical somatosensory evoked potentials to median nerve stimulation revealed significantly delayed peak latencies of N20, P20, P25, and N26, although N16 latency was normal. In particular, the interpeak latency between N16 and N20 was significantly delayed. In topographic maps, N20 and P20 were delayed in the peak latencies with normal scalp distributions. Dysfunction of somatosensory cortex indicated by the delay of cortical somatosensory evoked potentials may be related to a cortical mitochondrial abnormality. The absence of responses to auditory stimulation within 10 milliseconds could be related to the dysfunction of peripheral acoustic nerves.\r"

Despite the extent of the corneal surface disease, conjunctival inflammation was minimal. Visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 20/200. In one patient, the keratitis was complicated by the development of a surface defect with secondary Pseudomonas species infection. All patients had a history of exposure to household pets. Standard cultures were negative. Diagnosis was established in two of the three cases based on characteristic appearance of the protozoan in conjunctival scrapings. Electron microscopy of a conjunctival biopsy specimen in one patient confirmed the species. No recognized effective treatment is available for this infection.\r"

  ".W": "Infection by molecularly cloned HIV-1, in the presence of a high-titre neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), resulted in the selection of plaques in MT4 cells releasing HIV resistant to neutralization by the same MAb. The epitope recognized by the MAb was mapped to the V3 neutralization epitope at amino acids 305-321. The HIV-1 variants showed a reduced binding capacity for the selecting MAb as determined by immunofluorescence. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of complementary DNA derived from viral RNA, cloning and sequencing identified a base pair (bp) change C----G at position 6663 in variant 110.5/1, predicting a change at amino acid 308 Arg----Gly. No other changes in the epitope were observed by sequencing three other variants. Differential hybridization of PCR amplified viral RNA and DNA, with oligonucleotides specific for the observed bp change or the 'wild type' sequence, indicated that the variants 110.5/1 and 110.5/7 were genotypically mixed for 308Gly/Arg. Subsequent screening of biologically 'recloned' variants 110.5/1 and 110.5/7 identified two subclones homozygous for the 308Gly change. The Arg----Gly change appears to affect the binding of the antibody to the epitope, since the linear peptide substituting 308Gly for 'wild type' 308Arg was 100 times less potent in blocking the neutralization of parental HIV. Amino-acid residue 308 thus appears to be crucial for antibody binding to the epitope. In addition, mutations distant from the monoclonal antibody binding site may also affect neutralization by antibodies recognizing the V3 loop.\r"
