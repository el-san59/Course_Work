  ".W": "To determine the feasibility of the endovascular management of intimal defects while comparing the accuracy of arteriography with angioscopy and intravascular ultrasonography, we developed an in vivo model of arterial intimal flaps. In 10 superficial femoral arteries of five anesthetized mongrel dogs, intimal flaps were constructed and then imaged by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. A flexible microbiopsy forceps was used to remove each intimal flap under angioscopic guidance. Arteriographic lumen diameters were measured and cross-sectional areas calculated. Corresponding measurements by angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound with reduction in luminal area at the flap were obtained by use of computerized planimetry. Uniplanar arteriography identified 60% (6/10) of the intimal flaps, whereas angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound demonstrated 100%. Lumen diameter (in millimeters) measured by arteriography (3.4 +/- 0.6) correlated significantly with measurements by angioscopy (3.5 +/- 0.5, r = 0.77) and intravascular ultrasound (3.5 +/- 0.6, r = 0.96). Similarly, lumen area (square millimeters) by arteriography (9.2 +/- 2.9) correlated with measurements by angioscopy (8.9 +/- 2.2, r = 0.82) and intravascular ultrasound (8.6 +/- 2.7, r = 0.91). Reduction in lumen area by the flap by angioscopy (37 +/- 7%) and intravascular ultrasound (33 +/- 8%) also correlated significantly (r = 0.72). The intimal flaps were removed successfully in all 10 arteries as confirmed by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. We conclude that the endovascular management of intimal defects is possible. Additionally, angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound accurately evaluate lumen diameter and area while providing direct assessment of intimal defects.\r"

Whether or not all of these tributaries need to be ligated at the time of bypass is controversial since many will close spontaneously. Other consequences of retained fistulas range from local skin problems to diminished graft flow and ultimate graft thrombosis. A complication not previously reported is rupture of a retained arteriovenous fistula. This unusual and potentially catastrophic complication should be discoverable at an earlier stage by periodic graft surveillance by means of duplex sonography. The routine policy of selective ligation of saphenous vein tributaries needs to be reexamined.\r"

Operative mortality rate for 3570 patients undergoing unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was determined for all non-Veterans Administration surgeons and hospitals in New York State from 1985 to 1987. The average annual number of aneurysm operations per surgeon was 3.6, and per hospital it was 10.2. Unruptured aneurysm repair mortality for surgeons performing 1 to 5 aneurysm operations per year was 10% whereas for surgeons performing more than 26 aneurysm operations per year it was 6% (p less than 0.0001). Unruptured aneurysm repair mortality for hospitals performing 1 to 5 aneurysm operations per year was 14% and for hospitals performing more than 38 aneurysm operations per year it was 5% (p less than 0.0001). Even when these mortality rates were adjusted for differences in patient age, severity of illness, secondary diagnoses and admission status, significant mortality rate differences persisted: 9% versus 4% for low and high volume surgeons, respectively (p less than 0.001), and 12% versus 5% for low and high volume hospitals, respectively (p less than 0.001). Surgeons who performed more than 7 aneurysm operations per year devoted more of their practice to aortic (11%) and vascular operations (52%) than did surgeons who performed 7 or fewer aneurysm operations per year (2% and 19%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Histologic appearance does not correlate with the malignant potential of the lesion, and thus a reliable prognostic marker for these tumors is lacking. To determine whether flow cytometric analysis of paraffin block specimens by DNA index and synthetic phase fraction (SPF) would be of prognostic value, a retrospective chart review of 14 patients with carotid body tumors was performed. Three of 14 tumors were aneuploid and were the only tumors with SPF greater than 15%. One of 3 patients (33%) with an aneuploid tumor (SPF = 22%) developed a local recurrence; no patient with a diploid tumor developed a recurrence. Two of 3 (67%) patients with aneuploid tumors (SPF = 18%) but only 1 of 11 (9%) with a diploid tumor were symptomatic preoperatively (P = 0.03). DNA index and SPF may help select a subgroup of patients with more aggressive tumors who are at increased risk for recurrence and therefore require closer follow-up.\r"

From June 1987 to May 1989, 31 catheters were placed in 26 patients, for a total of 3,503 catheter use days. All catheters were placed via an infraumbilical approach when the more conventional supraumbilical route was technically difficult, dangerous, or impossible to be used. There were a total of 14 complications in 12 episodes (one in every 701 catheter use days), six episodes of catheter occlusion or vessel thrombosis (one in every 583 catheter use days), one catheter malfunction, one episode of cuff erosion through the skin, and one catheter that migrated through the inferior vena cava into the retroperitoneum. These results compared favorably with our experience with long-term catheters of a similar type placed via a supraumbilical approach into the superior vena cava. We conclude that the infraumbilical route for long-term central venous access is safe and technically easy and should be strongly considered in patients in whom venous access via the supraumbilical approach will be technically difficult or have a high likelihood of failure.\r"

  ".W": "Recently it has been reported that chlorhexidine 0.1% rinsing was not successful in eradication of gram-negative bacilli in patients who have head and neck cancer. These bacilli could play a role in irradiation mucositis. This study reports the effect of lozenges containing 2 mg polymyxin E, 1.8 mg tobramycin, and 10 mg amphotericin B qid on the oropharyngeal flora in 15 irradiated head and neck cancer patients. The results were compared with those of a previous study in two groups of 15 patients comparing chlorhexidine rinsing with placebo. In all patients using lozenges, eradication of gram-negative bacilli and yeasts was achieved within 3 weeks. A significant increase of enterococci was found. Mucositis was significantly reduced compared with the previous two groups. All patients showed erythema only, whereas 80% of both the placebo and chlorhexidine rinsing patients suffered from severe mucositis, with signs of pseudomembranes developing from the third week of conventional irradiation protocol. The effect of selective elimination of gram-negative bacilli from the oropharynx and the prevention of severe mucositis may be explained by the eradication of these bacteria and/or neutralization of salivary endotoxin, released by gram-negative bacilli, mediating the inflammatory processes.\r"

The mean age of the patients (four male and four female) was 67 years (range 55-75 years). Five cases had distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. Three patients were treated by esophageal resection, one by laser vaporisation, and four by chemotherapy. The median survival time was 4 months (range 9 days to 8 months). A complete local response to chemotherapy in serial esophagogramms was detected in one patient. All four patients given chemotherapy survived longer than those treated with esophageal resection only. Four (67%) of the six carcinomas analyzed by DNA flow cytometry contained DNA-aneuploid stemlines. The median S-phase fraction of these small cell carcinomas was high (16.3%), reflecting rapid cell proliferation rate, which may be related to their responsiveness to chemotherapy.\r"

The Cu/Zn ratio was increased in breast cancer patients (1.91 vs. 0.86) (P less than 0.001) but not in patients with benign breast diseases. The precise mechanisms responsible for the alterations in trace element levels in breast cancer patients are still unclear and require further evaluation. However, the serum copper levels and the Cu/Zn ratio may be used as biochemical markers in these patients.\r"

The presence of EH was significantly associated with better differentiated tumor having lesser degrees of myometrial invasion, low segment-adnexal-lymphovascular space and pelvic/para-aortic lymph node involvement. However, the presence of EH was not significantly associated with the less virulent histologic subtypes. The possible existence of two types of EC--a hormonal-dependent EC associated with EH, and an independent EC not associated with EH--is discussed and the prognostic significance of concomitant EH stressed.\r"

The histological differentiation of carcinomas showed a strong correlation with the SII. A statistically significant (F = 10.580, P less than 0.0005) negative correlation was found between the grade of malignancy and the SII. Patients under 50 years of age tended to have a lower SII, whereas patients over 49 years of age tended to have a higher SII. The tumor size, and nodal status showed no correlations with the SII in any of the patients. The histological differentiation of the tumor cells showed a strong correlation with the heterogeneity of the distribution of ER-positive cells in breast cancers.\r"

All patients underwent complete resection of the gross tumour mass (5 with positive and 40 with negative microscopic margins). Fourteen patients received postoperative adjuvant irradiation (group I), 16 preoperative irradiation (group II), and 15 preoperative irradiation and vascularized tissue transfer to the surgical bed after resection (group III). Major wound healing complications (defined as complications requiring at least 1 further surgical procedure) were lower in group III patients (chi-square = 5.57, P less than 0.03), as was the mean postoperative hospital stay (P less than 0.02, analysis of variance), and the mean number of secondary surgical procedures. Multivariate analysis showed that the only variable influencing length of stay was the use of tissue transfer. Careful intraoperative assessment of the adequacy of resection is essential prior to performing vascularized tissue transfer to ensure that tumour contamination of the donor site is avoided. Since this study is a nonrandomized clinical trial using sequential distribution of patients to the treatment groups, the data should be considered as preliminary, rather than definitive, evidence of the efficacy of vascularized tissue transfer.\r"

Assays for 64 specimens (52%, 33 primaries and 31 metastases) were considered evaluable. The clonogenicity of the primaries was less than that of the metastases (P less than 0.01). In the primary specimens, well-differentiated tumors were more highly clonogenic than poorly differentiated or signet ring cell tumors (P less than 0.05). Viable malignant cells and clonogenic cells were abundant in the primary tumors with mucosal (m) and submucosal (sm) invasion, i.e., in early gastric cancers by Japanese criteria, and were reduced in numbers as the primary tumors advanced (P less than 0.05). In vitro chemosensitivity corresponded well to the clonogenicity of the primary tumors stratified by the degree of tumor invasion. At the early phase of primary tumor progression and metastasis, clonogenicity and chemosensitivity were high. Aggressive chemotherapy with sensitive drugs after surgery may improve the clinical results for the gastric cancer patients with early phase of metastases.\r"

Pathological examination demonstrated metastatic lobular carcinoma of breast with strongly positive staining for estradiol. Additional hormonal therapy has been given to the patient since the operation. The patient is alive 16 months after the diagnosis of her disease. This case suggests that a vigorous diagnostic approach should be adopted in every jaundiced patient with metastatic breast cancer in order to exclude causes of jaundice other than diffuse metastatic involvement of the liver. Patients with extrahepatic biliary metastasis should be treated by aggressive surgical treatment, combined with systemic therapy which can offer them significant palliation and better survival.\r"

A score is attributed to each index and the prediction is based on the final score. Because the identification of curable renovascular hypertension is made according to numerical rules, the method is easily transformed into a computer-assisted process. The program is written in BASIC, and it is short enough to run on a personal computer.\r"

MRI has largely replaced CT in the search for brain infarct, brain tumor, and cerebral inflammatory and demyelinating processes. MRI is the study of choice in all cases of sellar and parasellar disease. It offers high-resolution images in any plane. GTPA enhancement has provided additional information from MRI without significant risk.

Systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most commonly associated medical problems. Occlusion of the posterior ciliary arterial blood supply to the retrolaminar optic nerve leads to axoplasmic stasis and further compromise of vessels in the nerve substance, which causes the typical funduscopic appearance. Although there is no recognized medical treatment that can reverse the visual loss, a recent report suggests optic nerve sheath decompression for a select group of patients with a gradual decline in vision due to ION may be beneficial. When ION occurs in persons less than 50 years of age, such etiologies as juvenile diabetes mellitus, antiphospholipid antibody-associated clotting disorders, collagen-vascular disease, and migraines should be considered. Rarely, complications of intraocular surgery or acute blood loss may cause an ischemic event in the optic nerve.\r"

In addition, reliable noninvasive diagnostic testing of the carotid artery has reduced the risk. The decision to consider surgical versus medical management must be made on an individual basis based on the patient's health, age, and the risk of angiography and surgery at each institution. In children and young adults, amaurosis fugax is a benign condition. In the older population amaurosis fugax is often the sentinel event of diffuse atherosclerotic disease and possible early death from myocardial infarction. A team including the neurologist, internist, ophthalmologist, and surgeon optimizes care of the whole disease and not just the symptom. It is hoped that information in the next decade will supply additional guidance in the care of this multifaceted malady.\r"

Tumors that frequently affect the anterior visual pathway include primary optic nerve sheath meningiomas, intracranial meningiomas, optic gliomas, pituitary tumors, and craniopharyngiomas. The location of these tumors sometimes prohibits a complete surgical excision that might jeopardize the visual system. Radiation therapy, however, can be beneficial in these cases. This article reviews the indications for radiotherapy of tumors that involve the anterior visual pathway, along with the possible complications. Cases that present the effect of radiation therapy and radiation damage are presented.\r"

  ".W": "Electrophysiologic testing of the visual system requires primarily the ERG and the VEP. The flash electroretinogram provides information about the outer retina only. The pattern electroretinogram is derived from both the outer retina and the innermost retinal layers including the ganglion cell layer. The VEP is based on electrical information recorded from the visual cortex in response to stimulation of the retina. Thus, the integrity of the entire visual pathway can be tested. Localizing ability of the VEP is limited. Since the visual cortex is heavily weighted by representation of the central retina, peripheral lesions, including those producing peripheral visual field abnormalities that do not impinge upon central fixation, may produce relatively little disturbance of the VEP. As with most tests, electrophysiologic studies of the visual system must be placed in context of the entire examination, including the patient's history and neurologic and especially neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation. Electrophysiologic testing has three main uses in neurology. Pattern-reversal VEPs may be useful in detecting hidden visual loss in multiple sclerosis; VEPs and ERGs can distinguish function from organic visual loss; and VEPs and ERGs can be useful in the diagnosis of visual loss in nonverbal patients, especially in children.\r"

Any patient showing a chronic iritis with posterior synechiae, vitritis in one or both eyes, an atypical pars planitis-like syndrome, big blind spot syndrome, and swollen or hyperemic optic discs should be asked the same questions. The physician should send one red-top tube of blood containing 2 to 3 ml serum to Microbiology Reference Laboratory, 10703 Progress Way, Cypress, CA 90630-4714, requesting a Lyme/treponemal panel. For $90 the patient will receive an RPR test with titer, serum FTA-ABS test, serum Lyme IFA IgG and IgM, and a serum Lyme ELISA test. If these tests are within normal limits and the physician is still suspicious, a Western blot can be ordered on serum. A green top tube with fresh white blood cells sent out by overnight express on a Monday or Tuesday will produce a Lyme PCR and a lymphocyte stimulation test. Finally, R.K. Porschen, director of MRL Laboratory, will provide information on the urine antigen test on an investigational basis. A careful history with emphasis on the specific questions noted above, a complete neuro-ophthalmological and physical examination ruling out other causative problems, and the laboratory studies here discussed will usually provide sufficient data to choose therapy. Much further active research into Lyme borreliosis is an important priority in medicine.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Hyperhomocysteinemia arising from impaired methionine metabolism, probably usually due to a deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase, is associated with premature cerebral, peripheral, and possibly coronary vascular disease. Both the strength of this association and its independence of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease are uncertain. We studied the extent to which the association could be explained by heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. METHODS. We first established a diagnostic criterion for hyperhomocysteinemia by comparing peak serum levels of homocysteine after a standard methionine-loading test in 25 obligate heterozygotes with respect to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (whose children were known to be homozygous for homocystinuria due to this enzyme defect) with the levels in 27 unrelated age- and sex-matched normal subjects. A level of 24.0 mumol per liter or more was 92 percent sensitive and 100 percent specific in distinguishing the two groups. The peak serum homocysteine levels in these normal subjects were then compared with those in 123 patients whose vascular disease had been diagnosed before they were 55 years of age. RESULTS. Hyperhomocysteinemia was detected in 16 of 38 patients with cerebrovascular disease (42 percent), 7 of 25 with peripheral vascular disease (28 percent), and 18 of 60 with coronary vascular disease (30 percent), but in none of the 27 normal subjects. After adjustment for the effects of conventional risk factors, the lower 95 percent confidence limit for the odds ratio for vascular disease among the patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, as compared with the normal subjects, was 3.2. The geometric-mean peak serum homocysteine level was 1.33 times higher in the patients with vascular disease than in the normal subjects (P = 0.002). The presence of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency was confirmed in 18 of 23 patients with vascular disease who had hyperhomocysteinemia. CONCLUSIONS. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for vascular disease, including coronary disease, and in most instances is probably due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is secreted exclusively by prostatic epithelial cells, and its serum concentration is increased in men with prostatic disease, including cancer. We evaluated its usefulness in the detection and staging of prostate cancer. METHODS. We measured serum PSA concentrations in 1653 healthy men 50 or more years old. Those with PSA values greater than or equal to 4.0 micrograms per liter then underwent rectal examination and prostatic ultrasonography. Ultrasound-directed prostatic needle biopsies were performed in the men with abnormal findings on rectal examination, ultrasonography, or both. The results were compared with those in 300 consecutively studied men 50 or more years old who underwent ultrasound-directed biopsy because of symptoms or abnormal findings on rectal examination. RESULTS. Serum PSA levels ranged from 4.0 to 9.9 micrograms per liter in 6.5 percent of the 1653 men (107). Nineteen of the 85 men in this group (22 percent) who had prostatic biopsies had prostate cancer. Serum PSA levels were 10.0 micrograms per liter or higher in 1.8 percent of the 1653 men (30). Eighteen of the 27 men in this group (67 percent) who had prostatic biopsies had cancer. If rectal examination alone had been used to screen the men who had biopsies, 12 of the 37 cancers (32 percent) would have been missed. If ultrasonography alone had been used to screen these men, 16 of the 37 cancers (43 percent) would have been missed. Serum PSA measurement had the lowest error rate of the tests, and PSA measurement plus rectal examination had the lowest error rate of the two-test combinations. CONCLUSIONS. The combination of measurement of the serum PSA concentration and rectal examination, with ultrasonography performed in patients with abnormal findings, provides a better method of detecting prostate cancer than rectal examination alone.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Dysphagia may develop in some patients many years after an attack of acute paralytic poliomyelitis. To identify clinical or subclinical signs of oropharyngeal dysfunction, we examined 32 patients (mean age, 48.9 years) with the post-polio syndrome (defined by new weakness in the limbs). Of the 32 patients, 14 had symptoms of new swallowing difficulties, and 18 were asymptomatic in this respect; 12 had a history of bulbar involvement during acute poliomyelitis. Swallowing function was assessed objectively by ultrasonography, videofluoroscopy, and an oral motor index score for 10 components of oral function. RESULTS. All but 1 of the 32 patients, regardless of whether they had new symptoms or previous bulbar involvement, had some abnormality on detailed testing of oropharyngeal function; only 2 patients had any signs of aspiration. The mean oral motor index score (a quantitative measure of oral sensorimotor function) in the patients was higher than that in age-matched normal subjects (P less than 0.001). Videofluoroscopy showed abnormalities of varying severity, including unilateral bolus transport through the pharynx, pooling in the valleculae or pyriform sinuses, delayed pharyngeal constriction, and impaired tongue movements. On ultrasonography, the mean (+/- SD) duration of wet swallows was significantly longer in the symptomatic patients than in the asymptomatic patients (2.67 +/- 0.70 vs. 1.65 +/- 0.42 seconds). The four patients who were reexamined two years later had objective signs of worsening oropharyngeal function and corresponding new symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with the post-polio syndrome, the bulbar muscles often have clinical or subclinical signs of dysfunction. These abnormalities suggest that in bulbar neurons there is a slowly progressive deterioration similar to that in the muscles of the limbs.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Airway responsiveness to inhaled nonspecific bronchoconstrictive agents has been demonstrated in normal, healthy infants. However, it is unknown whether airway responsiveness is present from birth or if it develops as a result of subsequent insults to the respiratory tract. To investigate this question, we assessed airway responsiveness in 63 normal infants at a mean age of 4 1/2 weeks. METHODS. Respiratory function was measured with use of the partial forced expiratory flow-volume technique to determine the maximal flow at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC). The infants inhaled nebulized histamine at sequentially doubled concentrations (0.125 to 8.0 g per liter), until a concentration was reached at which the VmaxFRC fell by 40 percent from the base-line value (PC40) or until a concentration of 8.0 g per liter was reached. We also assessed maternal serum levels of IgE, cord-serum levels of IgE, the infants' skin reactivity to several allergens, and the parents' responsiveness to histamine and obtained family histories of asthma and smoking. RESULTS. Airway responsiveness was increased in infants with a family history of asthma (n = 19; median PC40, 0.78 g per liter; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 1.15; P less than 0.01), parental smoking (n = 13; median PC40, 0.52 g per liter; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 5.40; P less than 0.05), or both (n = 20; median PC40, 0.69 g per liter; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 2.10; P less than 0.05), as compared with the infants with no family history of asthma or smoking. The infants with no family history of asthma or smoking had a median PC40 of 2.75 g per liter (95 percent confidence interval, 1.48 to 4.00). No significant relations were detected between the immunologic variables and the PC40 in the infants. CONCLUSIONS. This study indicates that airway responsiveness can be present early in life and suggests that a family history of asthma or parental smoking contributes to elevated levels of airway responsiveness at an early age.\r"

Using the progesterone antagonist mifepristone, we truncated the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in a blinded fashion to evaluate the relation of the events of the late luteal phase to the symptoms of PMS. METHODS. Fourteen women with PMS were given mifepristone (12.5 or 25 mg per kilogram of body weight) by mouth on the seventh day after the surge of luteinizing hormone. On the sixth through the eighth days after the surge, they also received injections of either placebo or human chorionic gonadotropin (2000 IU). Seven women with PMS received placebo instead of both mifepristone and human chorionic gonadotropin. All the women completed daily questionnaires measuring a variety of mood-related and somatic symptoms. RESULTS. Mifepristone consistently induced menses. The women receiving only mifepristone had plasma progesterone levels like those of the follicular phase (less than 3 nmol per liter) within four days, whereas all the other women had plasma progesterone levels characteristic of the luteal phase (greater than 8 nmol per liter) for at least seven days after treatment. In all three groups, the severity of symptoms was significantly higher after treatment than before, according to an analysis of variance with repeated measures. The level and pattern of the ratings of symptom severity were similar in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS. Neither the timing nor the severity of PMS symptoms was altered by mifepristone-induced menses or luteolysis. The temporal association of typical PMS symptoms with an artificially induced follicular phase suggests that endocrine events during the late luteal phase do not directly generate the symptoms of PMS.\r"

METHODS. We compared the length of survival and quality of life in patients who received treatment at a prominent unorthodox cancer clinic in addition to conventional treatment and in matched control patients from an academic cancer center who received only conventional treatment. All the patients had documented extensive malignant disease associated with a predicted median survival time of less than one year. The study sample consisted of 78 pairs of patients matched according to sex, race, age, diagnosis, and time from the diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent disease, who were enrolled over a period of 3 1/2 years. Periodic follow-up (approximately every two months) continued until death. RESULTS. There was no difference between the two patient groups in length of survival. Median survival for both groups was 15 months (P = 0.22; relative risk, 1.23; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.72). Quality-of-life scores were consistently better among conventionally treated patients from enrollment on. CONCLUSIONS. For this sample of patients with extensive disease and for this particular unorthodox treatment regimen, conventional and unorthodox treatments produced similar results.\r"

Calcium channel activity expressed from the cDNA is dramatically increased by coexpression of the alpha 2 and beta subunits, known to be associated with the dihydropyridine receptor. This channel is a high voltage-activated calcium channel that is insensitive both to nifedipine and to omega-conotoxin. We suggest that it is expressed predominantly in cerebellar Purkinje cells and granule cells.\r"

The energy cost of echolocation in a small (6 g) insectivorous bat, when hanging at rest, was recently measured at 0.067 Joules per pulse, implying a mean cost for echolocation in flight of 9.5 x basal metabolic rate (range 7 to 12x). Because flight is very costly, whether the costs of echolocation and flying are additive is an important question. We measured the energy costs of flight in two species of small echolocating Microchiroptera using a novel combination of respirometry and doubly-labelled water. Flight energy expenditure (adjusted for body mass) was not significantly different between echolocating bats and non-echolocating bats and birds. The low cost of echolocation for flying vertebrates may have been a significant factor favouring its evolution in these groups.\r"

Eight of the 16 HCC had a point mutation at the third base position of codon 249. The G----T transversion in seven HCC DNA samples and the G----C transversion in the other HCC are consistent with mutations caused by aflatoxin B1 in mutagenesis experiments. No mutations were found in exons 5,6,8 or the remainder of exon 7. These results contrast with p53 mutations previously reported in carcinomas and sarcomas of human lung, colon, oesophagus and breast; these are primarily scattered over four of the five evolutionarily conserved domains, which include codon 249 (refs 4-9). We suggest that the mutant p53 protein may be responsible for a selective clonal expansion of hepatocytes during carcinogenesis.\r"

Abnormalities in the structure and expression of the tumour-suppressor gene p53 are frequent in HCC cell lines, and allelic losses from chromosome 17p have been found in HCCs from China and Japan. Here we report on allelic deletions from chromosome 17p and mutations of the p53 gene found in 50% of primary HCCs from southern Africa. Four of five mutations detected were G----T substitutions, with clustering at codon 249. This mutation specificity could reflect exposure to a specific carcinogen, one candidate being aflatoxin B1 (ref. 7), a food contaminant in Africa, which is both a mutagen that induces G to T substitution and a liver-specific carcinogen.\r"

Middle-T associates with and thereby activates p60c-src, a cellular tyrosine kinase homologous to the oncogene product of Rous sarcoma virus. Activation of p60c-src by middle-T is accompanied both by dephosphorylation of tyrosine 527, a site which negatively regulates src kinase src kinase activity (reviewed in refs 4-6) and by autophosphorylation on tyrosine 416 (refs 7-10). Phosphoprotein p60c-src is subject to cell cycle-specific regulation. It is most active during mitosis and repressed in interphase. Here we report that mitotic p60c-src is dephosphorylated at tyrosine 527. We also show that in cells expressing middle-T, src kinase activity is high both in mitosis and during interphase. An oncogenic mutant src protein, p60c-src(527F), where tyrosine 527 is substituted by phenylalanine, is also highly active in all phases of the cell cycle.\r"

Self-cleavage requires only a divalent cation and is mediated at the genomic site by a sequence of less than 85 nucleotides. We propose that the genomic self-cleaving sequence element and a corresponding sequence from the anti-genomic RNA could generate related secondary structures. The region of the antigenomic sequence, predicted from the proposed structure, was synthesized and shown to be sufficient for self-cleavage. Evidence for two stems which form a tertiary interaction was obtained by site-specific mutagenesis of the antigenomic sequence. Efficient self-cleavage in 10 M formamide or 5 M urea, also a property of the genomic sequence, was dependent on base-pairing in both stems. But in the absence of denaturants, the stem distal to the site of cleavage was not required, suggesting that the tertiary interaction stabilizes the structure required for self-cleavage.\r"

  ".W": "Activator proteins bind to enhancer DNA elements and stimulate the initiation of transcription. It has been proposed that activators contact general initiation factors at a promoter, and evidence for such direct interaction has been obtained. Studies of transcription in vitro, however, have suggested that activators might function through an intermediary molecule(s) distinct from the general factors. In the first of these studies, we exploited the finding that one activator could inhibit transcription stimulated by a second activator (activator interference or 'squelching'). This inhibition, which is attributed to competition between the activators for a common target factor, could not be relieved by addition of a large excess of general initiation factors, suggesting that the target for which activators compete is distinct from these factors. Similar conclusions came from the observation that TFIID's expressed from cloned genes fail to replace partially purified 'natural' TFIID fractions in supporting activation, evidently because they lacked some component present in the impure fractions. While these lines of evidence for a novel 'mediator' of activation were negative, we also showed that a partially purified fraction from yeast would reverse activator interference. This positive effect of a presumptive mediator provided an assay for its activity, but its role in activation was still only inferred. We now present direct evidence for a mediator which is required for stimulation of transcription in vitro by the activators GAL4-VP16 and GCN4, but which has no effect on transcription in the absence of activator protein.\r"

Tat functions through an RNA target sequence located in the untranslated region at the 5' end of viral transcripts. In Xenopus oocytes, translation of RNA containing the target sequence is specifically activated by Tat. This activation only occurs if the RNA is injected into the nucleus, and might be due to Tat-dependent, nucleus-specific chemical modification of the RNA which somehow facilitates translation. Here we demonstrate that Tat activation of its target RNA in the nucleus involves a Tat-dependent covalent modification. The modified RNA is competent for translation after reinjection into either the nucleus or the cytoplasm in the absence of Tat. Furthermore, we find that the nucleoside analogue 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, which inhibits processivity of RNA polymerase II (ref. 9), blocks this Tat-dependent modification.\r"

The most common presentation was elevated intracranial pressure associated with ventriculomegaly (73%). The diagnosis was made by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and confirmed surgically in every case. In 68% of cases, the tumor involved midline structures in the central nervous system. Tumors were infratentorial in 29% of patients less than 1 year of age and in 60% of those more than 1 year of age. Most tumors were either primitive neuroectodermal tumors (41%, 7 of 9 located in midline posterior fossa structures) or astrocytomas (27%, 5 of 6 located in the hypothalamus, chiasm, or optic nerve). Twenty patients had gross or subtotal tumor resection. Surgical mortality and neurological morbidity were 10% and 5%, respectively. Of 5 patients who underwent a second operation for tumor recurrence, 3 demonstrated a change in the pathological features of the tumor from those of the original diagnosis. Of 10 surgical survivors with malignant tumors, 8 received chemotherapy and 5 radiation therapy. Radiation was not administered before 1 year of age. The overall 1-year survival was 70%, and 2-year survival was 58%. Two-year survival for benign and malignant tumors was not significantly different. We think that the interdisciplinary efforts directed toward the treatment of these tumors has improved survival and that all children should be offered entry to a research protocol and aggressive treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Epidural spinal cord compression by a malignant tumor is a rare occurrence in children. Both the tumors involved and the extent of involvement of the vertebral column are different in children and adults. Often, the epidural tumor in a child is identified before significant spinal canal compromise has occurred, and these children frequently can be managed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. There is a group of children, however, who have severe spinal canal encroachment by a tumor, as evidenced by a near complete or complete block on myelography. In this study, we report a group of patients with severe spinal cord compression, as documented by imaging studies. We compared the results of a decompressive laminectomy and subtotal tumor resection followed by adjuvant therapy with the results obtained with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy alone. Thirty-three patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Twenty-six were treated with a laminectomy and adjuvant therapy, and 7 were treated without surgical intervention. With surgical therapy, 25 of 26 epidurals were either improved or stable, whereas 4 of 7 nonsurgical patients deteriorated. Especially notable was a decrease in pain in the operative patients immediately after their procedure. There was no surgical mortality or morbidity. The results of this study indicate that children with severe spinal cord compression as evidenced by a near complete or complete block on myelography or filling of 50% or more of the spinal canal on magnetic resonance imaging are best treated by a combination of surgical decompression and tumor removal followed by adjuvant therapy.\r"

There was substantial disagreement about lesser indications for surgery. The respondents also expressed dissatisfaction with the current classification of Chiari malformations.

The relationship between the distribution of field potentials and the stimulation polarity was studied using the field potential distribution of the V-MEP in the lower thoracic spinal cord that had been represented on the isopotential maps. The first negative wave of the V-MEP showed maximal amplitude distribution in the anterior funiculus, which corresponds to the extrapyramidal tracts. This pattern was seen with both stimulation polarity arrangements: 1) stimulation with the cathode at the vertex and the anode at the hard palate, and 2) stimulation with the anode at the vertex and the cathode at the hard palate. When the cathode was at the vertex, the stimulation threshold was lower, and the response had higher amplitude than when the anode was at the vertex. Recording V-MEPs elicited by vertex cathode stimulation could provide an excellent method of monitoring the extrapyramidal tracts in cats.\r"

The size of each AVM was calculated by its volume, obtained by the multiplication of the three AVM diameters by 0.52. A surgical classification of AVM location (in 11 groups) is proposed. Types of feeders and of drainage were classified as superficial or deep; the extent of the drainage system was classified according to a four-degree scale. The mean flow velocity in the main AVM feeder, detected using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, was used as an indirect measure of AVM shunt flow in a small number of patients (n = 29). AVM volume was a very important prognostic factor: the incidence of hyperemic complications and the morbidity and mortality rate were significantly higher when the volume of the lesion was greater than 20 cm3 (P less than 0.0001 for hyperemic complications; P less than 0.001 for permanent morbidity and mortality). The incidence of hyperemic complications and the morbidity rate were higher in AVMs in rolandic, inferior limbic, and insular locations than in AVMs in other locations. As for other anatomic factors: a) the presence of deep feeders significantly increased the incidence of hyperemic complications, as well as the morbidity and mortality rate; b) the presence of deep drainage significantly increased permanent morbidity only; c) the extension of the venous system was significantly related to the development of hyperemic complications, and to morbidity and mortality. Transcranial Doppler examination showed that mean flow velocities greater than 120 cm/s in the main feeder were associated with a significantly higher rate of postoperative hematomas and transient deficits. A classification of cerebral AVMs that takes into account AVM volume and location, the type of feeders, the extent of the drainage system, and the main feeder flow velocity is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied the effect of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine (CS) on the development of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using a primate model of vasospasm. Eighteen monkeys were randomly divided into three groups: a sham-operated control group, an SAH group, and a CS-treated group. To induce SAH, the right side of the circle of Willis was dissected free of the arachnoid and an autologous blood clot was placed around the arteries. In the CS group, CS (5 mg/kg/day) was administered intramuscularly for 7 days after the induction of SAH. The vessel caliber was evaluated on angiograms before the induction of SAH (Day 0) and 7 days after SAH (Day 7). Histological changes and the deposition of IgG in the arterial wall were studied in the three groups. The combined values of the average reduction of the right cerebral arteries at Day 7 was significant (P less than 0.05) in the SAH group (-43.3%) and in the CS group (-31.3%) as compared with the Sham group (-0.7%); however, there was no significant difference between the values in the SAH and the CS groups. In the CS group, the average reduction in vessel caliber of the right middle and anterior cerebral arteries was significantly (P less than 0.05) less than in the SAH group; this did not prove true for the internal carotid artery, however. Although the deposition of IgG in the media and an inflammatory reaction were observed in the spastic arterial wall in both the SAH and CS groups, there was no definitive difference in these immune/inflammatory reactions between the two groups. It is suggested that CS may be helpful in reducing the severity of vasospasm, but may not have a major therapeutic effect, considering its systemic toxicity.\r"

Rabbits were injected with 5 ml of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna to produce SAH. Tritium accumulation in basilar arteries was measured after 30 minutes of incubation with 10(-7) M [3H]5-HT and a subsequent 120-minute superfusion (1 ml/min) period. The uptake of 5-HT by arteries 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after SAH was found to be 109%, 69%, 57% (P less than 0.05), and 67% (P less than 0.05) (n = 4, 4, 9, and 6; P less than 0.05) of control (n = 13; 16.8 +/- 1.2 X 10(2) dpm/mg tissue), respectively. The neuronal (cocaine-sensitive) uptake of 5-HT in the arteries 3 days after SAH decreased to approximately 38% of control, whereas the extraneuronal (cocaine-insensitive) uptake of both groups had almost the same absolute value (n = 6 and 6; 4.4 +/- 0.4 and 4.8 +/- 0.4 X 10(2) dpm/mg). Autoradiographic study disclosed that dense clusters of silver grains in the adventitia were not observed after treatment with cocaine (3 X 10(-5) M), although a diffuse distribution of grains was present throughout the vascular wall. The labeled arteries were stimulated by superfusion of tyramine, which is known to replace amines in the sympathetic nerve ending. Tyramine (10(-6) and 10(-4) M)-induced 3H efflux was significantly potentiated by SAH (n = 6) and was suppressed by treatment with cocaine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This surrogate receptor-mediated cellular cytotoxicity provides a means by which killer cells are directed specifically to the desired target glioma cells. The cytotoxic activity does not require the Fc region of the incorporated antibody molecules and shows more lytic potential than ordinary antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. By complement-mediated cell depletion and Percoll gradient separation, the effector cell populations for surrogate receptor-mediated cellular cytotoxicity are found to be natural killer cells, as in the murine system. This strategy of surrogate receptor incorporation into effector cells may provide not only valuable insights into the mechanism of cell-mediated cytotoxicity, but also a means of generating target-specific effector cells for clinical applications in neurosurgery.\r"

Tumor blood flow frequently showed a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement with high flow at the tumor periphery and a central area of hypoperfusion. Blood flow values were on average 28% lower in the peritumoral area than in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. In individual cases, blood flow values in the peritumoral edematous area were very low. These findings suggest that the hypodense area surrounding meningiomas does not solely represent vasogenic edema, but may actually represent tumor pressure ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Although most patients with hydrocephalus are treated effectively with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, a small group fails to respond to diversion procedures. In some patients within this group, hydrocephalus may be caused in part by the overproduction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In other patients, previous shunt infections may limit the ability of the peritoneum to absorb fluid, and patient response to a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be improved by reducing CSF production. We discuss a case of a 29-month-old hydrocephalic infant with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt who had ascites. Computed tomography showed bilateral symmetrical enlargement of the choroid plexus. Repeated cultures of the CSF and shunt tubing were sterile, and the daily production of the CSF exceeded 1000 ml. Therapy with acetazolamide decreased the CSF output temporarily, but it was discontinued after serious electrolyte abnormalities occurred. The endoscopic coagulation of the choroid plexus with a neodymium:YAG laser transmitted through a flexible quartz fiber decreased CSF production effectively. This procedure may be useful in a variety of clinical conditions associated with hydrocephalus or with other intraventricular lesions.\r"

The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission was 6 (range, 4-12). The rCBF/ICP probes were placed during surgical procedures (n = 11) or in an intensive care unit (n = 1) for subdural hematomas (n = 7), cerebral contusions (n = 4), and an epidural hematoma (n = 1). No probe-related complications occurred. Reduced CBF often occurred and was often inversely proportional to elevations in ICP. Posttraumatic cerebral arterial vasospasm in one patient was detected by rCBF monitoring and confirmed by angiography. In 6 patients who progressed to brain death, rCBF patterns disappeared, which correlated with their clinical and electroencephalographic examinations. Several patients with severe, diffuse brain injuries and high ICP had hyperemic rCBF patterns. In 2 of these patients, increases in rCBF preceded rises in ICP, which implied loss of autoregulation as a mechanism in the development of malignant cerebral edema. This method of CBF monitoring has not yet been established for clinical decision making. The early detection of ischemic or hyperemic responses by continuous CBF monitoring could hasten intervention aimed at restoring adequate tissue perfusion. The technique could also serve as an index of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and is suitable to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of head injury, especially the relationship of CBF to ICP.\r"

We based the diagnosis of very mild dementia in the 10 subjects on informant reports and the judgment of experienced clinicians. Deficits of some psychometric measures of memory, language, and speeded psychomotor performance were observed for these subjects. The histologic markers of Alzheimer's disease, including neurofibrillary tangles and both the \"diffuse\" and classic subtypes of senile plaques, were present in the neocortex in all 10 subjects but essentially were absent in the four controls. These findings indicate that even \"questionable\" dementia can be diagnostic for Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, because truly normal aging may be unaccompanied by neocortical senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the presence of these lesions should suggest the possibility of clinically undetected Alzheimer's disease.\r"

The protocol provides neuropathologic definitions of such terms as \"definite Alzheimer's disease\" (AD), \"probable AD,\" \"possible AD,\" and \"normal brain\" to indicate levels of diagnostic certainty, reduce subjective interpretation, and assure common language. To pretest the protocol, neuropathologists from 15 participating centers entered information on autopsy brains from 142 demented patients clinically diagnosed as probable AD and on eight nondemented patients. Eighty-four percent of the dementia cases fulfilled CERAD neuropathologic criteria for definite AD. As increasingly large numbers of prospectively studied dementia and control subjects are autopsied, the CERAD neuropathology protocol will help to refine diagnostic criteria, assess overlapping pathology, and lead to a better understanding of early subclinical changes of AD and normal aging.\r"

Sixty-four percent of these 50 survivors complained of new symptoms of muscle pain, fatigue, and weakness after a period of prolonged stability. This led to changes in lifestyle or activity in only 18%. The likelihood of expressing new complaints was not related to present age or interval since polio, and electrophysiologic testing did not distinguish between those with or without new problems. The development of new difficulties in a limb was most strongly predicted by significant paralysis of that limb at the time of the acute illness. Patients with leg weakness were twice as likely to complain of new problems compared to those with arm weakness. Elevated creatine kinase levels were present only in those with new complaints.\r"

Spontaneous \"residual spikes,\" ie, present after all resections, were present in 47% of patients who had no postoperative seizures or auras. However, they occurred in 72% of patients with any postoperative seizures (p less than 0.05). The location (convexity, mesial, or edge of resections) or the distribution (unifocal versus multifocal) of the residual spikes was not of prognostic value. Quantitative studies in 5-minute epochs of the postexcision ECoGs did not reveal a significant difference in the morphology of the residual spikes, ie, the amplitude or firing pattern (single versus polyspike), in the three groups. The group with postoperative seizures showed a higher number of spikes per epoch (greater than or equal to 50), but it was not significant. Although the study shows that patients with residual spikes may have good prognosis, they are at significantly higher risk for postoperative seizures as compared with those without residual spikes. The possibility that intensity of firing of residual spikes may be an additional predictor of outcome warrants further study.\r"

With increased disability, however, there was a smaller percentage of patients still driving with fewer miles traveled and with proportionately more accidents occurring. Though disability scores did not correlate well with driving ability, there were significantly more accidents in subjects with more severe PD. The presence of cognitive impairment was associated with an increased accident rate. We conclude that driving in PD may be a public health problem and that some PD patients should not drive.\r"

We estimated the predictive values of positive and negative StrAb assays (PV+ and PV-) and gain in diagnostic certainty using values for sensitivity, specificity, and thymoma frequency previously reported in the literature. Sensitivity for indirect immunofluorescence assays ranged from 0.83 to 0.84 (pooled estimate = 0.84; n = 68). Specificity ranged from 0.73 to 0.88 (pooled estimate = 0.77; n = 898). Frequency of thymoma ranged from 0.07 to 0.17 (pooled estimate = 0.12; n = 4,515). The expected gain in diagnostic certainty from StrAb was minimal in those aged 0 to 20 and those aged 60+. In those aged 20 to 60, a negative test helped to exclude thymoma, and a positive test raised diagnostic suspicion but was not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of thymoma (PV+ = 0.46).\r"

The AD patients with DEEG showed a decline of praxic functions, confrontation naming, and automatic speech functions. In contrast, the AD patients with NEEG did not show a deterioration of these functions during the 3-year follow-up period. Visual functions, understanding of speech, and memory functions deteriorated similarly in both groups. The clinical severity of dementia increased in both groups. Patients with DEEG showed a tendency toward a higher frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms and a higher risk of institutionalization than the patients with NEEG. Thus, an abnormal EEG at the early stage of AD may predict a more severe decline in cognitive functions.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we administered to 15 DAT patients and to 10 normal controls a confrontation-naming task and a verbal associates recognition task, with both living and nonliving items as stimuli. The hypothesis was confirmed, since DAT patients performed worse with living than with nonliving items, and scored worse than normal controls on the living but not the nonliving items.\r"

In order to define accurately the penetrance of a single HMSN I gene mutation, we performed nerve conduction studies in HMSN I families whose genetic defect was linked to chromosome 17 (HMSN Ia). All HMSN Ia subjects tested had slow nerve conduction velocities with a mean median velocity 20 +/- 6 m/sec, which did not change with age. The range of conduction velocities from affected individuals did not overlap those from their clinically normal relatives, indicating complete penetrance of the gene from early childhood. The results indicate that motor nerve conduction studies in children can add additional information for linkage studies and genetic counseling.\r"

The metabolism of glucose in the medulla of the patients with palatal myoclonus was significantly greater than that of the normal subjects. This may well have been due to increased metabolism of the inferior olivary nuclei. Glucose metabolism in the medulla of the patient with oculopalatal myoclonus was normal. These findings suggest that the inferior olivary nuclei, or a region of the brainstem encompassing the inferior olivary nuclei, are hypermetabolic in palatal myoclonus and may be the generators of the involuntary movements in palatal myoclonus.\r"

Eight patients evidenced a best dose in the dose-finding phase, but in the subsequent replication phase only two again improved to a similar degree.

We measured serotonin and its major metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), in the C-1 to C-7, T-1 to T-6, T-7 to T-12, and T-13 to L-3 spinal segments of tumor-free and tumor-bearing rats. In normal controls, a consistent rostral-to-caudal gradient for 5-HT and 5-HIAA was evident, but the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio remained constant. In paralyzed rats, 5-HT levels were unchanged, but the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was elevated, especially in the compressed segments. Treatment with either dexamethasone or indomethacin delayed onset of paraplegia but had no effect on 5-HT metabolism. Blocking 5-HT receptors by cyproheptadine, evaluated 30 hours after onset of paralysis and treatment, resulted in a reduction in the high water content, vascular permeability, and prostaglandin E2 synthesis in the compressed cord. Early administration of cyproheptadine effectively delayed the onset of paraplegia. These data indicate that receptor-activated serotonergic mechanisms participate in the disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier and that these effects can be manipulated pharmacologically.\r"

Anti-MBP IgG antibody-secreting cells were detected in CSF from eight of 13 consecutive patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis irrespective of stage of disease. The numbers were between 1/370 and 1/5,000 CSF cells (mean, 1/1,250 in the 13 patients). The highest numbers were encountered in two patients with severe signs of CNS involvement. The numbers decreased in parallel with clinical improvement after treatment. Anti-MBP IgG antibody-secreting cells were also observed in the CSF from patients with a variety of other inflammatory diseases of the nervous system, and their role in the development of tissue damage remains unsettled. Anti-MBP IgG antibody-secreting cells were not detected in the patients' blood, reflecting accumulation of this autoantibody response to CSF.\r"

Production and biologic function of cytokines are affected by changes in macro- and micronutrients. On the other hand, metabolic and catabolic consequences of the action of cytokines change nutrient status and the distribution of nutrients in tissues. The effect of some nutrients on cytokine production as well as some of the biologic effects of cytokines are mediated through metabolites of arachidonic acid (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, etc.). Other mechanisms involved in nutrient-induced changes of cytokines needs to be determined. Understanding the role of nutrients in cytokine production and biologic function during normal homeostasis, as well as under pathologic conditions, can help in designing proper dietary modification for the prevention and therapy of diseases.\r"

Despite its important role, however, little is known about the accuracy of self-reported intake. Recently, the doubly-labeled water method has been validated for the measurement of total energy expenditure in free-living subjects, and this method can serve as a reference for validating the accuracy of self-reported energy intake. Such comparisons have been made in nine recent studies, and considerable inaccuracy in self-reports of energy intake has been documented. Reported intakes tend to be lower than expenditure and thus are often underestimates of true habitual energy intake. Because the degree of underreporting increases with intake, it is speculated that individuals tend to report intakes that are closer to perceived norms than to actual intake.\r"

This phenomenon has not been observed in female rats, and there is little evidence that the results can be extrapolated to the adult human.

Fourteen patients had submental and eight patients had both submental and infralobular incisions. The average estimated amount of fat removed was 40 to 50 cc. In this series of patients there was a marked improvement in facial esthetics. Liposuction created greater definition of the submandibular region and a more distinct jawline, with an improved cervicomental angle. Patients appeared younger. No significant complications occurred, and patient satisfaction was high. A survey of oral and maxillofacial surgery training programs in the United States was conducted to determine experiences with liposuction. Survey results are presented. Our survey results are consistent with our clinical experiences with this procedure.\r"

Oroantral fistulas are not an uncommon finding after dental extractions. It is rare, however, to see herniation of the antral membrane with large polyps extending through the fistula into the oral cavity. A search of the literature revealed only two other such cases. Surgical removal of the polyps and closure of the oroantral fistula by means of a buccal sliding flap technique is discussed.\r"

Fourteen women and 10 men, ranging in age from 27 to 76 years (mean 48 years), participated. Nine patients had erosive lichen planus, one had benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, three had pemphigus vulgaris, seven had persistent major recurrent aphthous stomatitis, and four had chronic oral erythema multiforme. Fifteen patients had complete remission of signs and symptoms, seven had excellent response of signs and complete remission of symptoms, and two failed to respond. All other topical therapy was suspended before and during the study. All patients responded to two or three applications daily of medication. Side effects were minor and reversible, and included localized candidiasis (three patients), stomatopyrosis (two), and hypogeusia (one). Clobetasol propionate ointment in adhesive paste (Orabase) thus seems to be an effective topical steroid alternative to other less potent topical and systemic drugs for recalcitrant oral vesiculoerosive disease.\r"

Data were collected on daily perceived pain and helpfulness of mouth rinse, weekly mucositis grade, weight change, and interruption of therapy. Analysis of data revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any parameter. A retrospective review of 15 patients who had received at least 4600 cGy radiation to the oropharynx but had not used a daily mouth-coating rinse, was compared with the study group. Comparison of the two groups suggested that consistent daily oral hygiene and use of a mouth-coating agent will result in less pain and may reduce weight loss and interruption of radiation because of severe mucositis.\r"

UV light-induced damage to the skin begins early and results in multiple benign and malignant skin tumors, especially in sun-exposed areas of the head and neck. Oral cancers, primarily squamous cell carcinomas of the anterior third of the tongue, occur with greatly increased frequency. A patient with multiple facial neoplasia and oral manifestations of xeroderma pigmentosum is presented. The role of the dentist in surveillance of oral and perioral structures is emphasized. The dentist is advised against the use of UV light-curing units in these patients because UV-induced epithelial damage may cause dysplasia when DNA repair mechanisms are dysfunctional.\r"

However, the normal keratinocytes and the A-431 cell line did not show anchorage-independent growth. Both the normal human epidermal keratinocytes and cancer cell lines expressed multiple proto-oncogenes such as src, erb B-1, abl, fos, raf, H-ras, and myc, and the amount of expression of these oncogenes was notably higher in the cancer cell lines than in the normal keratinocytes. The expression of proto-oncogenes from the monolayer cultures of the cancer cell lines is poorly correlated with the anchorage independency of the cells. These data indicate that the anchorage independency is not directly linked to the expression of specific cellular proto-oncogene(s) of the monolayer cancer cell cultures.\r"

With the use of a rubber dam and high speed with water coolant, minimal pulp exposures were created in both the experimental and control teeth, by means of a 1/2 round bur. Zinc oxide-eugenol was the temporary filling material used to restore all cavities. In each dog, five teeth served as control and were capped with the use of calcium hydroxide. In one dog, 10 teeth from two quadrants were capped with the tested material (TCP). In the other dog, 11 teeth were capped with TCP. Four teeth from the fourth quadrant in each dog were capped with a mixture of calcium hydroxide and TCP in a ratio of 1:1 by weight (50/50 group.) The two dogs were killed after 70 days. The histologic evaluation of the response to the capping agents and at the exposure site was recorded. A total of 39 teeth were evaluated in this study. It was found that TCP as a capping agent precipitated the highest mean inflammatory response and also demonstrated the highest percentage of reparative dentin formation.\r"

A small portable cadmium telluride probe was used for radiation detection, with and without a gold collimator attached. Radioactivity was measured at six periarticular sites on both the operated and the contralateral control sides and expressed as a ratio with respect to a reference site over the sagittal suture. The use of a collimator was crucial to separate the activity associated with bone mineralization in the condylar head from that arising in the adjoining bones. The uptake in the condylar region increased 2 weeks after surgery and remained at a constant level above the presurgery baseline (p less than 0.05) until termination of the study (10 weeks). Postmortem histologic examinations confirmed the high bone turnover level by revealing newly formed bone as well as the presence of osteoclasts. The time course of nuclide uptake in the temporomandibular joint is different from the general pattern of rise and fall of activity displayed in other bones and indicates the persistence of bone remodeling processes during a prolonged period of at least 10 weeks.\r"

Most of these techniques either require ionizing radiation or are invasive, and all are expensive. Electronic thermography (ET) is an alternative diagnostic imaging modality that is inexpensive, nonionizing, and noninvasive. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess ET in the diagnosis of internal derangements of the TMJ. The study population consisted of 11 patients with internal derangement, and 12 normal patients. ET was conducted with an infrared thermographic unit, at 1.0 degrees and 0.5 degrees C sensitivity. Results from subjective blinded interpretations by two experts for the diagnosis of internal derangement of the TMJ were as follows: sensitivity, 86% (+/- 7.8%); specificity, 78% (+/- 7.1%). Results from objective measurements of thermal symmetry of the TMJ region were as follows: normal subjects, 89.3% (+/- 3.0%); internal derangement patients, 66.1% (+/- 16.2%); t21 = -4.89, p less than 0.01. In conclusion, ET appears to have some promise as a diagnostic aid in the evaluation of internal derangement of the TMJ. Additional, more extensive studies are needed before thermographic diagnosis of internal derangement is accepted clinically.\r"

A survey of dental patients at a dental school clinic revealed that although misconceptions continue to exist, particularly with regard to AIDS and the dentist, this population had higher levels of knowledge about AIDS than did those in earlier studies.\r"

This first report specifically addresses the appearance of primarily hemorrhagic intracranial lesions, including intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 28), and extracerebral lesions, which include 3 cases of venous sinus thrombosis (n = 20). The signal intensities of hemorrhage underwent a characteristic evolution with time with only minor variations in the study group. Magnetic resonance imaging detected direct evidence of hemorrhage for up to 2 months, but hemosiderin was detected as a late indicator of hemorrhage for up to 9 months. Magnetic resonance imaging was equal in benefit to head ultrasonography and computed tomography for the diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage, but magnetic resonance imaging was also able to approximate the time of onset of hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging was superior for the evaluation of extracerebral hemorrhage; ultrasonography failed to detect any of these lesions and computed tomography detected only 3 of 7. Short-term neurological abnormality was assessed, but the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to predict long-term neurodevelopmental delay is unknown and is the subject of an ongoing project.\r"

Ultrasonography detected 79% of lesions demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging whereas computed tomography detected only 41%. Periventricular leukomalacia was seen most often in preterm infants, basal ganglia hemorrhage and multicystic encephalomalacia primarily occurred in term infants, and focal parenchymal hemorrhage occurred at all gestational ages. Basal ganglia hemorrhage and multicystic encephalomalacia were strongly associated with histories of perinatal asphyxia, seizures, and early abnormal neurological status. All infants with basal ganglia hemorrhage (5/5) and multicystic encephalomalacia (5/5) and the majority with periventricular leukomalacia (9/12) and focal parenchymal hemorrhages (9/15) had developmental abnormalities at discharge.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that an unidentified cow's milk protein, other than beta-lactoglobulin and casein, might play a pathogenetic role in infant colic. Therefore, a radioimmunoassay was used to analyze human breast milk and infant formula samples for the presence of bovine IgG. Milk samples from 88 of the 97 mothers tested contained greater than 0.1 micrograms/mL of bovine IgG. In a study group of 59 mothers with infants in the colic-prone 2- to 17-week age group, the 29 mothers of colicky infants had higher levels of bovine IgG in their breast milk (median 0.42 micrograms/mL) than the 30 mothers of noncolicky infants (median 0.32 micrograms/mL) (P less than .02). The highest concentrations of bovine IgG observed in human milk were 8.5 and 8.2 micrograms/mL. Most cow's milk-based infant formulas contained 0.6 to 6.4 micrograms/mL of bovine IgG, a concentration comparable with levels found in many human milk samples. The results suggest that appreciable quantities of bovine IgG are commonly present in human milk, that significantly higher levels are present in milk from mothers of colicky infants, and that bovine IgG may possibly be involved in the pathogenesis of infant colic.\r"

In 46 children (86%), stones were secondary to a preexisting condition and in only 8 (14%) no apparent cause of stone formation could be found. Thirty-six patients (66%) had a solitary stone, most commonly found in the kidney. Urinary tract infections were present in 25 (47%) of the patients who had stones. Stones composed either of calcium oxalate or struvite were the most frequently recovered in these patients with infections. Twenty-one patients (39%) spontaneously passed their stones whereas 23 (43%) required either surgery or extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy to resolve stones. Ten (20%) showed recurrence of their urolithiasis, with follow-up examination periods ranging from 1 month to 10 years. Recent advances in the management of urolithiasis and their applicability to the pediatric population are discussed.\r"

Of 118 near-term (greater than 34 weeks' gestation) infants who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 103 (87%) were surviving and available for follow-up at between 1 and 7 years of age. Ninety-two of these children were seen on at least one occasion. Each visit included a history and physical examination, an evaluation by a physical therapist, and developmental testing by a pediatric psychologist. Medical outcome during year 1 found 31% of the children rehospitalized, primarily with respiratory illness. Outpatient-treated lower respiratory tract illness was seen in an additional 31% of the children. New or nonstatic neurologic problems were noted in 6% of the children. Abnormal growth during year 1 occurred in 26% of the children. At last clinic visit 16% of the children exhibited moderate-to-severe neurologic abnormalities, and 8% had moderate-to-severe cognitive delay. Sensorineural hearing loss occurred in 4% of children. Nine percent of the children were receiving speech and language therapy; screening tests showed that an additional 6% had speech and language delay. Overall, at last visit 16 (20%) of the children exhibited some type of handicap. A review of the literature on follow-up studies of non-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-treated infants with persistent pulmonary artery hypertension produced an impairment rate of 18.5%. Outcome post-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation appears similar to that seen in less ill cohorts of infants treated with more \"conventional\" therapy. Long-term follow-up of all such infants remains essential.\r"

Clefts, which occurred only on the ventral 180 degrees of the rim, were observed in 34% of neonates with an annular hymen. Fifty-six percent of neonates had a longitudinal intravaginal ridge, 87% had an external hymenal ridge, and 13% had a tag extending from the rim or a ridge. Periurethral ligaments were frequently observed. It is concluded that lateral and ventral clefts, intravaginal and external ridges, and periurethral bands are normal anatomical findings in the newborn.\r"

Nonsevere episodes had more favorable outcomes in subjects assigned to treatment with amoxicillin than with placebo, as measured by the proportions that resulted in initial treatment failure (3.9% vs 7.7%, P = .009) and the proportions in which middle-ear effusion was present at 2 and 6 weeks after onset (46.9% vs 62.5%, P less than .001; and 45.9% vs 51.5%, P = .09, respectively). In subjects whose entry episode was non-severe, those assigned to amoxicillin treatment had less average time with effusion during the succeeding year than those assigned to placebo treatment (36.0% vs 44.4%, P = .004), but recurrence rates of acute otitis media in the two groups were similar. In the 2-year-and-older age group, severe episodes resulted in more initial treatment failures in subjects assigned to receive myringotomy alone than in subjects assigned to receive amoxicillin with, or without, myringotomy (23.5% vs 3.1% vs 4.1%, P = .006). In the study population as a whole, severe episodes in subjects assigned to receive amoxicillin alone, and amoxicillin with myringotomy, had comparable outcomes. It is concluded that children with acute otitis media should routinely be treated with amoxicillin (or an equivalent antimicrobial drug). The data provide no support for the routine use of myringotomy either alone or adjunctively.\r"

Impedance tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry were equally accurate, detecting the presence or absence of middle-ear effusion in 73% and 72% of ears, respectively. The presence of effusion in ears with tympanographic patterns other than type A and type B was not consistently and reliably predicted. The higher sensitivity of impedance tympanometry (90%) compared with that for acoustic reflectometry (58%) contrasted with the opposite findings for specificities (54% vs 88%). It is concluded that impedance tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry measure different events at the tympanic membrane and their utility lies in the fact that they complement each other. These instruments can aid the experienced otoscopist in confirming a clinical impression and assist the less experienced clinician in validating or improving otoscopic skills.\r"

Prior to treatment, a physical examination was performed, a clinical score assigned, and pulmonary function and SaO2 were measured. Although forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and SaO2 had strong correlation with the overall clinical score (r2 = .47, .49 respectively), many patients with low clinical scores and apparent mild clinical disease had low FEV1 values (as low as 20% predicted). Of the individual components of the clinical score (ie, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulsus paradoxus, accessory muscle use, dyspnea, and wheezing), the degree of accessory muscle use correlated most closely with lung function followed by the degree of dyspnea and wheezing. Similarly, the degree of accessory muscle use correlated most closely with SaO2 followed by dyspnea and respiratory rate. Significant correlation (r2 = .59) was found between SaO2 and FEV1, although the range of SaO2 value for a given FEV1 was wide and some patients with low FEV1 values had normal SaO2 values. These results show that although clinically apparent severe disease and hypoxemia were always associated with low FEV1, their absence does not exclude the presence of airflow obstruction. It is concluded that for the optimal evaluation of acute asthma in children in the emergency room, clinical evaluation should be used in conjunction with objective laboratory measurements.\r"

The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was comparable in the two groups (high-frequency ventilation 57%, conventional ventilation 50%). Pulmonary functions were determined at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 weeks postnatal ages. Data were collected while subjects were in a nonsedated state during spontaneous breathing. These sequential data show similar patterns of change in pulmonary mechanics during high-frequency ventilation and conventional mechanical ventilation irrespective of gestational age, birth weight stratification, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. There was no significant difference in the pulmonary functions with either mode of ventilation during the acute phase (less than or equal to 4 weeks) of respiratory disease. When evaluated by the clinical diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the pulmonary data suggested a less severe dysfunction in the high-frequency oscillatory ventilation-treated bronchopulmonary dysplasia group compared with the conventional mechanical ventilation-treated group. These results indicate that high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in preterm neonates does not reduce the risk of acute lung injury; however, the magnitude of the pulmonary dysfunction in the first 2 weeks of life merits a reevaluation.\r"

Actigraphic automatic sleep-wake scorings were compared with those of the polysomnograph; total agreement rate was 85.3%. In the second study, sleep patterns of 63 sleep-disturbed and 34 control healthy children (aged 9 to 27 months) were compared. These children were home-monitored by actigraph for a mean of 4.45 nights (total 482 nights). Actigraphic data were analyzed by an automated scoring procedure. Sleep quality of the sleep-disturbed children, measured by actigraphically derived sleep percent and number of longer-than-5-minute wakings, was significantly lower than that of the control subjects (P less than .0001). Sleep measures showed significant night-to-night stability in both groups. The stability of specific measures and their age trends were different between the groups. Actigraphic sleep measures alone could discriminate between sleep-disturbed and control children with a highly correct assignment rate of 79.4% and 91.2%, respectively.\r"

The goal of this study is to determine whether parents who report being present when their infant falls asleep at bedtime are more likely to report increased frequency of night waking by the infant. Mothers were consecutively recruited when they brought their infants to the clinic for their 9-month well-child visit. A total of 122 mothers agreed to participate and completed a questionnaire consisting of closed-ended, forced choice questions about their infant's feeding and sleeping behavior, and demographic and psychosocial characteristics. For 33% of the mothers, a parent was routinely present when the infant went to sleep. The entire sample of infants averaged 4.1 night wakings during the week prior to questionnaire completion. Infants whose parents were present at bedtime were significantly more likely to wake at night than infants whose parents were not present (6.2 vs 3.1, P = .01). Frequent night waking (seven or more wakings in the prior week) occurred in 28% of the sample. More of the infants whose parents were present experienced frequent night waking compared with infants whose parents were not present (40% vs 22%, P less than .04). When potential confounding variables were controlled by multivariate analysis, parents being present when the child went to sleep was independently associated with night waking (P less than .03). The association of parental presence at bedtime and night waking has implications for preventing and managing disruptive night waking in infancy.\r"

Sera from 404 premature infants enrolled in single-dose studies and 1024 premature infants enrolled in multidose studies were analyzed, representing a total of 987 samples and 2743 serum samples, respectively. The sera were obtained from treated and control infants at the time of treatment and 1 week, 4 weeks, and 6 months thereafter. Polyclonal antisera generated in rabbits against the small molecular weight proteins were uniformly reactive with the bovine surfactant test antigens; however, antibodies reacting with the surfactant proteins were never detected by immunoblot analysis with the infant sera. Antibodies against common human viral antigens were readily detected in infant serum samples. The horseradish-peroxidase conjugated second antibodies (antihuman immunoglobin G or antihuman immunoglobins A, G, and M) used in the studies were highly reactive with both immunoglobin G and immunoglobin M classes of human antibodies. Therefore there was failure to detect specific immunological responses to the bovine surfactant proteins present in Survanta after single or multiple doses of exogenous surfactant administered in the perinatal period.\r"

  ".W": "One-day-old, awake infants underwent an olfactory classical conditioning procedure to assess associative learning within the olfactory system of newborns. Experimental infants received ten 30-second pairings of a novel olfactory conditioned stimulus (a citrus odor of neutral value) and tactile stimulation provided by stroking as the reinforcing unconditioned stimulus (a stimulus with positive properties). Control babies received only the odor, only the stroking, or the stroking followed by the odor presentation. The next day, all infants, in either the awake or sleep state, were given five 30-second presentations of the odor. Results were analyzed from video tapes scored by an observer unaware of the infants' training condition. The results indicate that only those infants who received the forward pairings of the odor and stroking exhibited conditioned responding (head turning toward the odor) to the citrus odor. The performance of the conditioned response was not affected by the state of the baby during testing, because both awake and sleeping infants exhibited conditioned responses. Furthermore, the expression of the conditioned response was odor specific; a novel floral odor presented during testing did not elicit conditioned responses in the experimental babies. These results suggest that complex associative olfactory learning is seen in newborns within the first 48 hours of life. These baseline findings may serve as normative data against which observation from neonates at risk for neurological sequelae may be compared.\r"

Results indicated that the children with ADD+H were rated as having more pervasive behavioral problems at home and more pervasive and severe conduct problems at school than the children with ADD-H. Laboratory tests found the children with ADD+H to be impaired in behavioral inhibition and vigilance whereas children with ADD-H were more impaired in the consistent retrieval of verbally learned material Drug effects were noted on the parent and teacher ratings and on most laboratory measures, with all three doses typically producing significant changes but rarely differing among themselves in effectiveness. The groups were not found to differ significantly on any measures in their response to methylphenidate. However, more children with ADD-H were clinically judged as having either no clinical response (24%) or responding best to the low dose (35%) of medication. In contrast, most ADD+H (95%) children were judged to be positive responders and most were recommended to receive the moderate to high dose (71%).\r"

  ".W": "Primary vesicoureteral reflux is a polygenic abnormality due to a deficiency of the ureterovesical junction which allows urine in the bladder to ascend into the ureter and kidney. Fifty-one black children with primary vesicoureteral reflux were evaluated and treated at Children's Hospital from 1976 to 1986. The results of the evaluation and treatment were compared with those of 493 white patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux seen during the same time interval. The general approach to management was nonsurgical. There were no radical differences in the mode of presentation, age at presentation, and age at resolution. The distribution of reflux by maximum grade was not affected by race. Overall, 19 (37%) black children experienced spontaneous resolution of reflux. The mean duration of reflux in black children who had spontaneous resolution was 14.6 months. This duration was statistically significantly shorter than that in white patients with spontaneous resolution of vesicoureteral reflux (P less than .005). Surgical correction was believed to be required in 8 (16%) patients and 8 (16%) were lost to follow-up. Renal scarring demonstrated by intravenous pyelogram or renal scan was initially present in 12 (23%) black patients compared with 65 (13%) white patients. This was due to a higher percentage of renal scarring in black girls which was not explained by distribution of grades of reflux. There was no progression of scarring in our black patients, whereas 3 (0.6%) white patients had progression of scarring. Although vesicoureteral reflex is rarely seen in black patients (9% of series), it has similar demographic features.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty children underwent venipuncture or intravenous cannulation performed by 22 physicians and 6 nurses. The median age of the children was 12 months. Parents remained with their children during 31 (62%) of the 50 procedures. Parents were more likely to stay if they had previously stayed when this child (P = .05) or another (P = .02) had undergone a procedure. Parental decision to stay was not related to parental age, gender, race, marital status, or level of education, nor to the residents' age, gender, or level of training. Only 43% of the parents who did stay were given that option by the residents, and of those who did not stay 37% reported that physicians asked them to leave. Nonverbal cues by the residents, such as pulling the curtain closed or turning their back toward parents, were noted in 58% of the encounters in which parents did not stay. The residents and nurses indicated that parents should stay with their child for the following procedures: laceration repair, 66%; venipuncture, 58%; intravenous cannulation, 48%; arterial blood sampling, 32%; suprapubic aspiration, 20%; and lumbar puncture, 14%. In the emergency room studied, it appears that for venipuncture and intravenous cannulation, the majority of parents stay with their children. Parental decision to stay or leave is frequently made without discussion with the physician.\r"

Matched control subjects for those older than 5 years were also evaluated. Outcome was defined as normal for cognitive scores greater than or equal to 85 and normal neurologic examination results, suspect for cognitive scores 70 through 84 or nonfocal neurologic findings such as hypertonia/hypotonia, and abnormal for cognitive scores less than 70 or abnormal neurologic examination results. Of the 10 school-aged children studied, 9 were normal and there were no differences in mean cognitive scores between subjects and controls (IQ subjects = 109 +/- 12 [SD], IQ controls = 107 +/- 13). For preschoolers aged 2.7 through 4.11 years, the mean cognitive score was 91 +/- 11 and 7 (70%) were normal. For infants 6 through 30 months, the mean cognitive score was 101 +/- 22 and 27 (57%) were normal. A total of 7 children (21% of those studied) had abnormal audiologic assessments. Three children demonstrated mild high-frequency and 4 moderately severe high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss which was bilateral in 3 and of undetermined laterality in 1. Abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome was significantly associated with cerebral infarction and chronic lung disease. Outcome was not related to demographic or perinatal variables, illness severity prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or underlying diagnosis. Neurodevelopmental outcome among survivors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in this series is consistent with previous reports of morbidity among neonates with severe respiratory failure treated conventionally.\r"

We describe a previously healthy boy who acquired primary CMV infection at approximately 2 years of age and experienced a 2-year-long debilitating multisystem illness from which he ultimately recovered. Clinical features of this illness included fatigue, poor weight gain, pallor, unexplained fever, musculoskeletal complaints, drenching night sweats, lymphadenopathy, and massive hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lymphocytosis, and elevated immune complex levels. Cellular immune function was impaired during the illness but was demonstrably normal during convalescence, and there was no other evidence for a known immunodeficiency state. Immunoblot analysis showed enhanced antibody response to a 66-kd infected cell protein after symptomatic recovery. Despite consistently normal indices of hepatic function, liver enlargement persisted after other symptoms had resolved. Liver biopsy demonstrated a mononuclear cell portal tract infiltrate with fibrosis, but CMV could not be demonstrated directly in this tissue. Primary CMV infection has not been reported previously to cause the persistent symptoms seen in this child.\r"

We also have discovered that Ter impedes helicase activity of TAg at the tau R site, when tau R is in this same orientation. In contrast with Ter, a mutant EcoRI protein (EcoRIgln111) that binds with high affinity to but does not cleave at EcoRI recognition sequences impedes both simian virus 40 fork movement and the helicase activity of TAg in an EcoRI-site-orientation-independent manner. These results suggest that a feature common to both TAg and prokaryotic helicases may recognize the Ter-tau R complex resulting in a polarized pause in fork propagation and DNA unwinding. In contrast, the effect of EcoRIgln111-DNA complex on these reactions may be based on steric hindrance.\r"

When maintained in the presence of an equimolar concentration of soluble heparin, the bFGF mutant (M1-bFGF) is as potent as bFGF in stimulating cell proliferation in normal and transformed fetal bovine aortic endothelial cells, in adult bovine aortic endothelial cells, and in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. However, under the same experimental conditions, M1-bFGF is at least 100 times less efficient than bFGF in stimulating plasminogen activator (PA) production in endothelial cells, as assayed by chromogenic PA assay, SDS/PAGE zymography, and Northern blot analysis of urokinase-type PA mRNA. In the presence of heparin, M1-bFGF binds to bFGF plasma membrane receptors present on endothelial cells in a manner undistinguishable from bFGF. It also induces the same tyrosine phosphorylation pattern when added to NIH 3T3 cells. The data suggest that the PA-inducing activity of bFGF may depend upon a functional domain that differs from those involved in the mitogenic activity of the growth factor and that the binding of bFGF to its plasma membrane receptor may not be sufficient to induce urokinase-type PA production in endothelial cells.\r"

The coding region of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT; UDPglucose:alpha-D-galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.12) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from total cDNA of a classic galactosemic individual and was characterized by direct sequencing of the products. Two missense mutations were identified: (i) replacement of valine-44 by methionine and (ii) replacement of methionine-142 by lysine. These mutations led to a drastic reduction in GALT activity when individual mutant cDNAs were overexpressed in a mammalian cell system, although full-length protein is synthesized in this assay. The two galactosemia mutations account for 3 of the 15 galactosemia alleles analyzed. These results suggest that galactosemia is caused by a variety of mutations, which might be responsible for the observed clinical heterogeneity of this disorder. We also present the molecular characterization of two GALT polymorphisms: (i) replacement of leucine-62 by methionine and (ii) replacement of asparagine-314 by aspartate. It appears that galactosemia mutations tend to occur in regions that are highly conserved throughout evolution while the polymorphisms change variable residues.\r"

Altogether, these data indicate that NHK cultures can be used to quantitate phenotypic changes associated with neoplastic transformation of normal human epithelial cells upon exposure to defined regimens of physicochemical treatments.\r"

  ".W": "SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) is an extracellular, Ca2(+)-binding protein associated with cellular populations undergoing migration, proliferation, and/or differentiation. Active preparations of SPARC bind to specific components of the extracellular matrix and cause mesenchymal cells to assume a rounded phenotype. In this study we show that SPARC modulates the progression of bovine aortic endothelial cells through the cell cycle. At a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml, SPARC inhibited the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into newly synthesized DNA by approximately 70%, as compared to control cultures within 24 hr after the release from G0 phase. The effect was dose-dependent and reached greater than 90% inhibition at 30 micrograms of SPARC per ml after 24 hr. A 20-residue synthetic peptide (termed 2.1) from a non-Ca2(+)-binding, disulfide-rich domain of SPARC also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]thymidine uptake in endothelial cells within 24 hr after release from G0 phase. An inhibition of 50% was seen with peptide 2.1 at a 0.4 mM concentration. Peptides from other regions of the SPARC protein did not produce this effect. Maximum inhibition of [3H]thymidine uptake by SPARC and peptide 2.1 occurred during the early-to-middle G1 phase of the endothelial-cell cycle. From 0-12 hr after release from G0 phase, cells exhibited delayed entry into S phase, which normally occurred at 24 +/- 2 hr. These results were further corroborated by flow cytometry. In the presence of SPARC at 20 micrograms/ml, 72% fewer cells were in S phase after a 24-hr period; a similar, but less marked, reduction was seen with peptide 2.1. Peptide 2.1 did not cause cell rounding, whereas peptide 1.1, a highly efficient inhibitor of endothelial-cell spreading, exhibited essentially no activity with respect to cell-cycle progression. It therefore appears that the transient, inhibitory effect of SPARC on the entry of endothelial cells into S phase does not depend on the overt changes in cell shape mediated through cytoskeletal rearrangement.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular actions of nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) may be mediated by changes in protein phosphorylation. The tyrosine phosphorylation of two predominant proteins of molecular mass 40 and 42 kDa is seen in PC-12 cells treated with NGF or EGF, correlating with activation of a previously identified serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein (MAP). Stimulation of phosphoprotein (pp) 40 and 42 phosphorylation and MAP kinase activity by NGF but not EGF is selectively attenuated by staurosporine and K-252A. Moreover, the time courses of pp40/42 phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation produced by NGF or EGF are identical. Chromatography of lysates from growth factor-treated cells on ion-exchange or hydrophobic-interaction HPLC resolves MAP kinase into two peaks, neither of which precisely coelutes with pp40 or pp42. One of these peaks (II) exhibits no detectable phosphotyrosine. The other peak (I) has some overlap with pp40. However, the activity residing in both peaks is almost completely inhibited after treatment with alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that, at least, serine/threonine phosphorylation is required for the activity of these enzymes. These data indicate that while tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be a critical early event in NGF action, the role of this modification in activation of MAP kinases remains unclear.\r"

  ".U": "91187852\r", 
  ".W": "High-affinity interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2Rs) are expressed by T cells activated in response to foreign histocompatibility antigens but not by normal resting T cells. To exploit this difference in IL-2R expression, anti-Tac-M, a murine monoclonal antibody specific for the IL-2R alpha chain, was used to inhibit organ allograft rejection. However, the use of murine anti-Tac as an immunosuppressive agent was limited by neutralization by human anti-murine antibodies and by weak recruitment of effector functions. To circumvent these difficulties, a humanized antibody to the IL-2R, anti-Tac-H, was prepared. This molecule is human with the exception of the hypervariable segments, which are retained from the mouse. In vivo survival of anti-Tac-H is 2.5-fold longer than simultaneously administered anti-Tac-M (terminal t1/2, 103 hr vs. 38 hr). In addition, anti-Tac-H is less immunogenic than anti-Tac-M when administered to cynomolgus monkeys undergoing heterotopic cardiac allografting. Specifically, all monkeys treated with anti-Tac-M developed measurable anti-anti-Tac-M levels by day 15 (mean onset, 11 days). In contrast, none of the animals receiving anti-Tac-H produced measurable antibodies to this monoclonal antibody before day 33. Finally, there was a prolongation of graft survival in the cynomolgus heterotopic cardiac allograft model in animals receiving anti-Tac. In animals that received anti-Tac-M, the allograft survival was prolonged compared to that of the control group (mean survival, 14 +/- 1.98 days compared to 9.2 +/- 0.48 days; P less than 0.025). Graft survival was further prolonged by anti-Tac-H with a mean survival of 20.0 +/- 0.55 days (compared to controls, P less than 0.001; compared to anti-Tac-M, P less than 0.02). There was no toxicity attributable to the administration of either form of anti-Tac. Thus, anti-Tac-H significantly prolonged allograft survival in primates, without toxic side effects, and may be of value as an adjunct to standard immunosuppressive therapy in humans.\r"

Thirty-three electrophoretic types (ETs), representing distinctive multilocus clonal genotypes, were identified, but nearly half the disease episodes, including more than two-thirds of the cases of toxic-shock-like syndrome, were caused by strains of two related clones (ET 1 and ET 2). These two clones were also represented by recent pathogenic European isolates. A previous report of a relatively high frequency of expression of exotoxin A among isolates recovered from toxic-shock-like syndrome patients in the United States was confirmed; and the demonstration of this association both within clones and among distantly related clones supports the hypothesis that exotoxin A is a causal factor in pathogenesis of this disease. Near identity of the nucleotide sequences of the exotoxin A structural gene of six isolates of five ETs in diverse phylogenetic lineages was interpreted as evidence that the gene has been horizontally distributed among clones, presumably by bacteriophage-mediated transfer.\r"

Molecular cloning has revealed diversity in the subunits that compose this heterooligomeric receptor, but each previously elucidated subunit displays amino acid similarity in conserved structural elements. We have used these highly conserved regions to identify additional members of this family by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One PCR product was used to isolate a full-length cDNA from a human retina cDNA library. The mature protein predicted from this cDNA sequence in 458 amino acids long and displays between 30 and 38% amino acid similarity to the previously identified GABAA subunits. This gene is expressed primarily in the retina but transcripts are also detected in the brain, lung, and thymus. Injection of Xenopus oocytes with RNA transcribed in vitro produces a GABA-responsive chloride conductance and expression of the cDNA in COS cells yields GABA-displaceable muscimol binding. These features are consistent with our identification of a GABA subunit, GABA rho 1, with prominent retinal expression that increases the diversity and tissue specificity of this ligand-gated ion-channel receptor family.\r"

Comparison of the amino acid sequence with the corresponding enzymes from yeast and bacteria reveals a near identity of the important catalytic regions and greater than 40% overall similarity. The Td gene is unique in the tomato genome and its coding region is interrupted by eight introns. Its expression is greater than 50-fold higher in sepals and greater than 500-fold higher in the rest of the flower than in leaves or roots. Its overexpression, however, is strictly confined to the parenchymal cells of the floral organs. In young tomato leaves, the chloroplast-bound enzyme is found almost exclusively in the subepidermal spongy mesophyll cells.\r"

A 5' deletion analysis of the promoter defined a region from position -205 to position -83 relative to the start of transcription as necessary to observe the phytochrome response. This region contains the binding site for the light-induced binding activity (LRF-1) found in Lemna nuclear extracts.

Targets with different cellular locations have been described, such as mRNA translation initiation sites, pre-mRNA splicing sites, or the genes themselves. However the mechanism(s) of action and the intracellular distribution of antisense oligomers remain poorly understood. Antisense oligomers conjugated with various fluorochromes or with BrdUrd were microinjected into the cytoplasm of somatic cells, and their cellular distribution was monitored by fluorescence microscopy in fixed and nonfixed cells. A fast translocation in the nuclei and a concentration on nuclear structures were observed whatever probe was used. Nuclear transport occurs by diffusion since it is not affected by depletion of the intracellular ATP pool, temperature, or excess unlabeled oligomer. Accumulation of the oligomers in the nuclei essentially takes place on a set of proteins preferentially extracted between 0.2 M and 0.4 M NaCl as revealed by crosslinking of photosensitive oligomers. The relationship between nuclear location of antisense oligomers and their mechanism of action remains to be ascertained and could be of major interest in the design of more efficient antisense molecules.\r"

The mechanisms involved in the increase in albumin-positive hepatocytes during aging of NARs and their treatment with 3'-MeDAB were analyzed. NARs were found to have four species of albumin mRNA: intact mRNA and those lacking the regions corresponding to exon H, exon G-H, and exon H-I. In 4-week-old NARs, the level of intact albumin mRNA was about 1/4000 of that in normal rats and mRNA lacking the exon H sequence was the major species. In aged and 3'-MeDAB-treated aged NARs, all four species of mRNA increased and the relative proportion of mRNAs lacking two exon sequences to mRNAs lacking one exon sequence was greatly increased, suggesting that aging is associated with changes of the splicing pattern and that 3'-MeDAB treatment enhanced these changes. In aged NARs and 3'-MeDAB-treated aged NARs, there was an increase in the amount of aberrant 60-kDa albumin. The 60-kDa protein could be a translation product of mRNAs lacking two exons, the amount of which increases in aged NARs and 3'-MeDAB-treated NARs.\r"

Libraries of such plasmids, representing pools of transposon-mutagenized individuals, are used as hybridization probes against cloned sequences to determine whether a transposon has inserted next to a particular site in the genome. The number of loci that can be screened simultaneously by this procedure is quite large. We have screened an array of cDNA clones representing almost 700 distinct loci against libraries representing 760 mutagenized flies, and we obtained hybridization signals to 7 different cDNAs. Three of these events have been analyzed in detail and represent genuine insertions near genomic sequences that correspond to the cDNAs.\r"

We studied binding of peptides containing residues 52-61 from hen egg lysozyme (HEL) to I-Ak on fixed peritoneal macrophages or to solubilized affinity-purified I-Ak. Optimum binding occurred at pH 5.5-6.0 with accelerated kinetics relative to pH 7.4; equilibrium binding was also higher at pH 5.5-6.0 than at 7.4. Similar enhancement at pH 5-6 was observed for the binding of hemoglobin-(64-76) to I-Ek and of ribonuclease-(41-61) to I-Ak. In contrast, the binding of HEL-(34-45) to I-Ak was minimally enhanced at acid pH. Dissociation of cell-associated or purified peptide-I-Ak complexes was minimal between pH 5.5 and 7.4, with increased dissociation only at or below pH 4.0 [HEL-(46-61)] or pH 5.0 [HEL-(34-45)]. Thus, optimum peptide binding occurs at pH values similar to the endosomal environment, where the complexes appear to be formed during antigen processing. In addition, we examined the effect of a number of polysaccharides on the binding of peptide to I-Ak. None of these competed with the HEL peptide 125I-labeled YE52-61 for binding to I-Ak. [3H]Dextran also failed to bind purified I-Ak. Polysaccharides do not appear to bind to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules, which explains the T-cell independence of polysaccharide antigens.\r"

Tyrphostin had no effect on the capacity of aluminum fluoride to increase [Ca2+]i. To determine whether a function of PTK is the phosphorylation of PLC, immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-phosphotyrosine from detergent lysates of B-lymphoblastoid cells were assayed for PLC activity. Ligation of mIgM increased immunoprecipitable PLC activity 2-fold by 90 sec and 4-fold by 30 min. Specific immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis identified tyrosine phosphorylation of the gamma 1 isoform of PLC after 60 sec of stimulation. Activation of PLC in B cells by mIgM requires PTK function and is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1, suggesting a mechanism of PLC activation similar to that described for certain receptor PTKs.\r"

To determine whether these two viruses share similarities in their properties during latency, we analyzed ganglia and brain of an African green monkey experimentally infected with SVV for the presence of viral nucleic acid using the polymerase chain reaction technique. We detected SVV DNA in dorsal root ganglia but not in brain of this monkey, which demonstrated no apparent clinical signs of SVV infection. Our results suggest that SVV becomes latent in monkey ganglia and that latency can develop in the absence of clinical varicella (chickenpox). These studies provide an animal model system to study varicella virus latency.\r"

This condition is due to the failure of a multicomponent microbicidal oxidase that normally yields a low-midpoint-potential b cytochrome (cytochrome b245). Although defects in the X chromosome-linked cytochrome account for the majority of CGD patients, as many as 30% of CGD cases are due to an autosomal recessive disease. Of these, greater than 90% have been shown to be defective in the synthesis of a 47-kDa cytosolic component of the oxidase. We demonstrate here in three unrelated cases of autosomal recessive CGD that the identical underlying molecular lesion is a dinucleotide deletion at a GTGT tandem repeat, corresponding to the acceptor site of the first intron-exon junction. Slippage of the DNA duplex at this site may contribute to the high frequency of defects in this gene.\r"

  ".W": "The extent to which the librations of rigid molecules can model the crystallographic temperature factor profiles of proteins has been examined. For all proteins considered, including influenza virus hemagglutinin, glutathione reductase, myohemerythrin, myoglobin, and streptavidin, a simple 10-parameter model [V. Schomaker and K. N. Trueblood (1968) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B 24, 63-76] is found to reproduce qualitatively the patterns of maxima and minima in the isotropic backbone meansquare displacements. Large deviations between the rigid molecule and individual atomic temperature factors are found to be correlated with a region in hemagglutinin for which the refined structural model is unsatisfactory and with errors in the structure in a partially incorrect model of myohemerythrin. For the high-resolution glutathione reductase structure, better results are obtained on treating each of the compact domains in the structure as independent rigid bodies. The method allows for the refinement of reliable temperature factors with the introduction of minimal parameters and may prove useful for the evaluation of models in the early stages of x-ray structure refinement. While these results by themselves do not establish the nature of the underlying displacements, the success of the rigid protein model in reproducing qualitative features of temperature factor profiles suggests that rigid body refinement results should be considered in any interpretation of crystallographic thermal parameters.\r"

These functions are anion transport, ankyrin binding, and generation of senescent cell antigen, an aging antigen that terminates the life of cells. Structural similarity of brain and erythroid band 3 is suggested by the reaction of antibodies to synthetic peptides of erythroid band 3 with brain band 3, the inhibition of anion transport by the same inhibitors, and an equal degree of inhibition of brain and erythrocyte anion transport by synthetic peptides of erythroid band 3 (pep-ANION 2, residues 588-602; pep-COOH, residues 812-827; pep-COOH-N6, residues 813-818). One of these segments, pep-COOH, contains antigenic determinants of senescent cell antigen. These findings suggest that the transport domains of erythroid and neural band 3 are similar functionally and structurally and support the hypothesis that the immunological mechanism of maintaining homeostasis is a general physiologic process for removing senescent and damaged cells in mammals and other vertebrates.\r"

Males are selectively territorial against conspecific males. Virgin females accept only conspecific males, probably chosen by wing color. Females are nonterritorial and spend most of their adult activity ovipositing on the correct larval food plants. Eyes of both species contain four spectral types of visual pigments (P360, P437, P500, and P568) but the distribution of these pigments within the receptor mosaic is quite different between both species and sexes. The ventral eye region of L. heteronea is tetrachromatic but that of L. rubidus is trichromatic, lacking the blue-sensitive visual pigment P437. The dorsal eye region of males of both species is dichromatic (P360 and P437). Visual-pigment spectra and wing-reflectance spectra are well matched for effective discrimination of wings of conspecific males from those of other species. The dorsal region of female eyes is trichromatic, containing P360, P437, and P568. The third visual pigment, P568, is important for long-range detection by ovipositing females of red coloration on Eriogonum and Rumex food plants. P568 has the same absorbance spectrum as the human red-cone and is considerably red-shifted compared to the P530 possessed by most insects. That the sexes and closely related species can have such major differences in distribution of visual pigments indicates that the visual system is as readily altered as wing coloration in the course of adaptive evolution.\r"

When 50-100 cells of this phenotype are injected into an irradiated animal, they can permanently repopulate the entire hematopoietic system. In the present study, limiting-dilution and single-cell experiments were used to address the question of how individual Thy-1loLin-Sca-1+ stem cells contribute to repopulation of the hematopoietic system following irradiation. We calculated that 1 of 13 Thy-1loLin-Sca-1+ cells formed a clone comprising greater than 1% of peripheral white blood cells 3-7 weeks after injection. The majority of these clones included both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Approximately one-third of the clones continued to produce new blood cells for 9 weeks or more, but the remainder disappeared earlier, including many that were multilineage. Thus, while the majority of Thy-1loLin-Sca-1+ bone marrow cells whose progeny are detected in the in vivo repopulation assay are pluripotential, only a subset undergo long-term self-renewal in vivo. Repopulation appears to be oligoclonal when limiting numbers of Thy-1loLin-Sca-1+ cells are injected. However, the number of clones contributing to hematopoiesis increases in proportion to the number of Thy-1loLin-Sca-1+ cells injected, bringing into question the notion that steady-state hematopoiesis in normal individuals is oligoclonal.\r"

Previous studies demonstrated that lectins specific for N-acetylglucosamine bind to the peritrophic membrane and proposed that the membrane contains chitin [Rudin, W. & Hecker, H. (1989) Parasitol. Res. 75, 268-279]. In the present study, we show that the peritrophic membrane is digested by Serratia marcescens chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14), leading to the release of N-acetylglucosamine and fragmentation of the membrane. We also report the presence of a malaria parasite chitinase that digests 4-methylumbelliferyl chitotriose. The enzyme is not detectable until 15 hr after zygote formation, the time required for maturation of the parasite from a zygote to an ookinete, the invasive form of the parasite. At 20 hr, the enzyme begins to appear in the culture supernatant. The chitinase extracted from the parasite and found in the culture supernatant consists of a major band and two minor bands of activity on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The presence of chitin in the peritrophic membrane, the disruption of the peritrophic membrane during invasion, and the presence of chitinase in ookinetes suggest that the chitinase in ookinetes is used in the penetration of the peritrophic membrane.\r"

This simple and robust technique has been used in a great many experimental and neuropathological studies; however, the function of this enzyme has remained a matter of speculation. We, therefore, undertook to characterize this enzyme biochemically. With biochemical and immunochemical assays, NADPH diaphorase was purified to apparent homogeneity from rat brain by affinity chromatography and anion-exchange HPLC. Western (immunoblot) transfer and immunostaining with an antibody specific for NADPH diaphorase labeled a single protein of 150 kDa. Nitric oxide synthase was recently shown to be a 150-kDa, NADPH-dependent enzyme in brain. It is responsible for the calcium/calmodulin-dependent synthesis of the guanylyl cyclase activator nitric oxide from L-arginine. We have found that nitric oxide synthase activity and NADPH diaphorase copurify to homogeneity and that both activities could be immunoprecipitated with an antibody recognizing neuronal NADPH diaphorase. Furthermore, nitric oxide synthase was competitively inhibited by the NADPH diaphorase substrate, nitro blue tetrazolium. Thus, neuronal NADPH diaphorase is a nitric oxide synthase, and NADPH diaphorase histochemistry, therefore, provides a specific histochemical marker for neurons producing nitric oxide.\r"

The bulk (70% to greater than 90%) of the labeling occurs on beta-tubulin and appears early after irradiation, whereas alpha-tubulin is labeled later. The labeling ratio of beta-tubulin to alpha-tubulin (beta/alpha ratio) is reduced by prolonged incubation, prolonged irradiation, urea, high ionic strength, the use of aged tubulin, dilution of tubulin, or large concentrations of colchicine or podophyllotoxin. Glycerol increases the beta/alpha ratio. Limited data with [3H]podophyllotoxin show that it covalently bound with a similar beta/alpha distribution. Vinblastine, on the other hand, exhibits preferential attachment to alpha-tubulin. The possibilities that colchicine binds at the interface between alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin, that the drug spans this interface, and that both subunits may contribute to the binding site are suggested.\r"

The system compares mRNA expression of genes from normal and tumor-derived human mammary epithelial cells grown in a special medium that supports similar growth rates of the two cell types. mRNAs uniquely expressed in normal cells are recovered as cDNAs after subtraction with mRNA from tumor cells. Seven different clones, from 0.6 to 4.8 kilobases in transcript size and including both rare and abundunt transcripts, were recovered in the first 23 clones analyzed. Among the isolated clones were genes encoding the gap-junction protein connexin 26, two different keratins, and glutathione-S-transferase pi, as well as an unknown gene in the S100 family of small calcium-binding proteins. In principle, tumor-suppressor genes include two classes: class I, in which loss of function results from mutation or deletion of DNA and class II, in which loss of function is from a regulatory block to expression. A class II suppressor gene is assumed to be regulated by a different suppressor gene that lost its function by mutation or deletion. Both classes of tumor-suppressor genes may provide valuable proteins with clinical applications in cancer diagnosis or therapy. Class II suppressors may be especially useful because the normal genes are present and their reexpression may be inducible by drugs or other treatments.\r"

The cDNA for murine tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (mTNF-R1) predicts a mature polypeptide of 425 amino acids that is 64% identical to its human counterpart, whereas the cDNA of murine tumor necrosis factor receptor type 2 (mTNF-R2) predicts a mature protein of 452 amino acids that is 62% identical to human tumor necrosis factor receptor type 2. The two murine tumor necrosis factor receptors have limited sequence homology (approximately 20% identity) in their extracellular regions but no apparent similarity in their cytoplasmic portions. Northern (RNA) analysis indicates a single 2.6-kilobase (kb) transcript for mTNF-R1; a 3.6-kb and a more predominant 4.5-kb transcript are observed for mTNF-R2. A human cell line transfected with either mTNF-R1 or mTNF-R2 expression vectors specifically bound 125I-labeled recombinant murine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Although mTNF-R1 had a similar affinity for both recombinant murine TNF-alpha and human TNF-alpha, mTNF-R2 showed strong specificity for recombinant murine TNF-alpha. This result suggests that the various activities of human tumor necrosis factor alpha reported in mice or in murine cell lines are probably mediated by mTNF-R1.\r"

Isolated Fc epsilon R+ cells have recently been shown to contain all of the IL-4-producing capacity of the nonlymphoid compartment of spleen and bone marrow. Here, purified Fc epsilon R+ cells are shown to be enriched in cells that contain histamine and express alcian blue-positive cytoplasmic granules. By electron microscopy, the vast majority of cytoplasmic granule-containing cells are basophils; they constitute approximately 25% and approximately 50%, respectively, of Fc epsilon R+ spleen and bone marrow cells from anti-IgD-injected mice. The Fc epsilon R- populations contain cells that form colonies typical of mast cells. The Fc epsilon R+ populations also contain cells that, upon culture with IL-3, form colonies of alcian blue-positive cells, but (in contrast to colonies derived from Fc epsilon R- populations) the colonies are small, and all the cells die within 2-3 weeks. The Fc epsilon R+ cells synthesize histamine during a 60-hr culture with IL-3, while the Fc epsilon R- cells do not. These results indicate that IL-4-producing Fc epsilon R+ cells are highly enriched in basophils.\r"

A considerable fraction of the spermatozoa ejaculated into the female reproductive tract of mammals remains motionless in storage sites until ovulation, when the spermatozoa resume maximal motility and reach the fertilization site within minutes. The nature of the signal for sperm movement is not known, but one possible mechanism is attraction of spermatozoa to a factor(s) released from the egg. We have obtained evidence in favor of such a possibility by showing that human spermatozoa accumulate in follicular fluid in vitro. This accumulation into follicular fluid was higher by 30-260% than that observed with buffer alone and was highly significant (P less than 10(-8)). Not all of the follicular fluids caused sperm accumulation; however, there was a remarkably strong correlation (P less than 0.0001) between the ability of follicular fluid from a particular follicle to cause sperm accumulation and the ability of the egg, obtained from the same follicle, to be fertilized. These findings suggest that attraction may be a key event in the fertilization process and may give an insight into the mechanism underlying early egg-sperm communication.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective sample of 69 healthy adults, age range 18-80 years, was studied with magnetic resonance imaging scans (T2 weighted, 5 mm thick) of the entire cranium. Volumes were obtained by a segmentation algorithm that uses proton density and T2 pixel values to correct field inhomogeneities (\"shading\"). Average (+/- SD) brain volume, excluding cerebellum, was 1090.91 ml (+/- 114.30; range, 822.19-1363.66), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume was 127.91 ml (+/- 57.62; range, 34.00-297.02). Brain volume was higher (by 5 ml) in the right hemisphere (P less than 0.0001). Men (n = 34) had 91 ml higher brain and 20 ml higher CSF volume than women (n = 35). Age was negatively correlated with brain volume [r(67) = -0.32, P less than 0.01] and positively correlated with CSF volume (r = 0.74, P less than 0.0001). The slope of the regression line with age for CSF was steeper for men than women (P = 0.03). This difference in slopes was significant for sulcal (P less than 0.0001), but not ventricular, CSF. The greatest amount of atrophy in elderly men was in the left hemisphere, whereas in women age effects were symmetric. The findings may point to neuroanatomic substrates of hemispheric specialization and gender differences in age-related changes in brain function. They suggest that women are less vulnerable to age-related changes in mental abilities, whereas men are particularly susceptible to aging effects on left hemispheric functions.\r"

The kinase avidly phosphorylates synapsin I and contains a polyglutamate sequence, which suggests an association with chromatin as well. A possible role in synapsin I phosphorylation and in nuclear Ca2+ signaling was supported by immunochemical and ultrastructural examination of CaM kinase-Gr distribution. CaM kinase-Gr immunoreactivity was present in the molecular and granule cell layers of the rat cerebellum. This pattern corresponded to the occurrence of the enzyme in the granule cell axons and nuclei, respectively. Immunoblots confirmed these findings. Thus, CaM kinase-Gr may mediate and coordinate Ca2(+)-signaling within different subcellular compartments.\r"

  ".W": "The enthalpy change (delta H) accompanying the alpha-helix to random coil transition in water has been determined calorimetrically for a 50-residue peptide of defined sequence that contains primarily alanine. The enthalpy of helix formation is one of the basic parameters needed to predict thermal unfolding curves for peptide helices and it provides a starting point for analysis of the peptide hydrogen bond. The experimental uncertainty in delta H reflects the fact that the transition curve is too broad to measure in its entirety, which precludes fitting the baselines directly. A lower limit for delta H of unfolding, 0.9 kcal/mol per residue, is given by assuming that the change in heat capacity (delta Cp) is zero, and allowing the baseline to intersect the transition curve at the lowest measured Cp value. Use of the van't Hoff equation plus least-squares fitting to determine a more probable baseline gives delta H = 1.3 kcal/mol per residue. Earlier studies of poly(L-lysine) and poly(L-glutamate) have given 1.1 kcal/mol per residue. Those investigations, along with our present result, suggest that the side chain has little effect on delta H. The possibility that the peptide hydrogen bond shows a correspondingly large delta H, and the implications for protein stability, are discussed.\r"

First, the fitting parameters derived earlier from a data base of 10 proteins were used to predict the unfolding thermodynamics of 4 other proteins. The agreement between the observed and predicted values is comparable to that found for the 10 proteins studied initially. Next, the temperature dependences of the Gibbs energy and enthalpy changes for unfolding of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme were predicted and compared with data in the literature. The predicted and observed temperature dependences are similar and the predicted results indicate that cold denaturation should be observed at low temperatures, as observed recently for a T4 lysozyme mutant. The fitting parameters derived from thermodynamic data for protein unfolding and for hydration of model compounds were used to predict the unfolding thermodynamics of the poly(L-alanine) helix. The results predict that helix formation is enthalpy-driven, and the predicted enthalpy change for unfolding (0.86 kcal per mol per residue) is close to the value found in a recent calorimetric study of a 50-residue alanine-rich helix.\r"

  ".U": "91187892\r", 
  ".W": "Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) is a hereditary syndrome, associated with tumors and cysts in multiple organ systems, whose expression and age of onset are highly variable. The availability of a genetic test for the early and reliable detection of individuals carrying the defective gene would be beneficial for VHL patients and their relatives, since many of the manifestations of VHL can be successfully treated if detected in their early stages, while the complications of undetected disease can be devastating. We have previously shown that the VHL gene maps to chromosome 3p. To provide genetic markers for the development of a reliable diagnostic test, and to further narrow and eventually clone the VHL defect, we have generated DNA markers for chromosome 3p. With these markers, we have performed a multipoint genetic linkage analysis in 28 VHL pedigrees, comprising 470 individuals, 164 of whom were affected with VHL. Here we report the identification of tightly linked markers, including flanking markers that bracket the VHL gene to a small region on chromosome 3p25-p26. This finding has several major implications. While visceral cysts of the kidney, pancreas, and epididymis are commonly found in VHL and are considered diagnostic criteria for this disorder, they also occur in the general population. The presence of cysts, unaccompanied by other more typical lesions such as retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastoma, may therefore represent a major diagnostic problem, leading to errors in the assessment of disease status. The application of flanking markers for the VHL gene for presymptomatic diagnostic testing confirms that epididymal cysts are indeed not suitable as a diagnostic criterion in this disorder. Pheochromocytomas occur nonuniformly in VHL families and may also be associated with other hereditary tumor syndromes; our genetic studies imply that the phenotype in VHL families with and without pheochromocytomas is caused by defects within the same gene. The absence or presence of this tumor type is therefore due to the pleiotropic expression of a single gene rather than to the existence of several different genes for VHL. The region on chromosome 3p13-p14 known to contain several chromosomal translocation breakpoints in families with \"pure familial renal cell carcinoma\" is quite proximal to the VHL locus in 3p25-p26 we have identified. Chromosome 3p may therefore contain two loci for renal cell carcinoma: one gene (or genes) in 3p13-p14 and the VHL gene in 3p25-p26, whose aberration is also associated with other typical manifestations of VHL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The products of the Escherichia coli dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE heat shock genes have been previously shown to be essential for bacteriophage lambda DNA replication at all temperatures and for bacterial survival under certain conditions. DnaK, the bacterial heat shock protein hsp70 analogue and putative chaperonin, possesses a weak ATPase activity. Previous work has shown that ATP hydrolysis allows the release of various polypeptides complexed with DnaK. Here we demonstrate that the ATPase activity of DnaK can be greatly stimulated, up to 50-fold, in the simultaneous presence of the DnaJ and GrpE heat shock proteins. The presence of either DnaJ or GrpE alone results in a slight stimulation of the ATPase activity of DnaK. The action of the DnaJ and GrpE proteins may be sequential, since the presence of DnaJ alone leads to an acceleration in the rate of hydrolysis of the DnaK-bound ATP. The presence of GrpE alone increases the rate of release of bound ATP or ADP without affecting the rate of hydrolysis. The stimulation of the ATPase activity of DnaK may contribute to its more efficient recycling, and it helps explain why mutations in dnaK, dnaJ, or grpE genes often exhibit similar pleiotropic phenotypes.\r"

One polar, and presumably surface-exposed, region of ICAM-1 showed no significant identity with myelin-associated glycoprotein. A synthetic peptide analog based on the sequence of this region (JF9) mimicked the inhibitory effects of the anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody WEHI-CAM-1. These included inhibition of ICAM-1-dependent homotypic aggregation of Raji Burkitt lymphoma and phorbol-ester treated U937 cells at concentrations as low as 80 micrograms/ml (24 microM). In addition, at a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml, the peptide analog effectively inhibited cytotoxic cell activity, an ICAM-1-dependent effector function of the immune response. This simple method of sequence analysis may have general applicability to the identification of functional domains in homologous, but functionally distinct, proteins such as the translated products of gene families.\r"

The effects of the nonsecreted and the secreted 16-kDa growth factor on the morphology, motility, and cell invasive potential (gelatinase activity) were compared. aFGF coupled to a SP was actively secreted out of the producing cells. The secretion of aFGF was not necessary for induction of gelatinase activity, as this was observed in NBT-II cells producing aFGF with or without SP. Production of aFGF, whether secreted or not secreted, resulted in increased in vitro motility of most isolated clones; however, there was no correlation between aFGF level and motility rate. The data suggest that expression of aFGF in NBT-II cells induces metastatic potential through an autocrine or intracrine mechanism.\r"

In a carbohydrate-shift strategy, N-terminal and internal peptide sequences were obtained on glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of GP-2, respectively, by gas-phase sequencing. Sets of mixed oligonucleotides and the polymerase chain reaction were used to obtain a double-stranded cDNA probe, which was used to isolate overlapping cDNA clones from a dog pancreatic cDNA library. The sequence of these clones revealed an open reading frame that encodes a protein of 509 amino acids, eight N-linked oligosaccharide attachment sites, and an N-terminal signal sequence absent from the mature form of GP-2 associated with ZGMs. The C terminus shows a 20-residue hydrophobic transmembrane domain preceded by a decapeptide containing potential phosphatidylinositol-glycan attachment sites. GP-2 completely released from ZGMs by exogenous phospholipase C showed similar immunochemical properties and electrophoretic mobilities compared to the form associated with ZGMs. A similar form of GP-2 was released from zymogen granules permeabilized with saponin and incubated in the absence of added phospholipase C. Kinetic analysis of GP-2 release at 0 degrees C and 37 degrees C suggested the presence of a granule enzyme responsible for endogenous release of GP-2 to granule contents and into the apical medium. The data indicate that GP-2 is a phosphatidylinositol-glycan-linked membrane protein released from the membrane of mature zymogen granules by an enzymatic mechanism. The cDNA structure presented here thus encodes both membrane-bound and free forms of GP-2.\r"

One similarity comprises a 23-amino acid alpha-helix-turn-beta-strand motif found in each enzyme within a domain that is inserted between the two halves of the dinucleotide binding fold. A second correspondence, which consists of two alpha-helices connected by a large loop and beta-strand, is located in the Gln-tRNA synthetase within a region that binds the inside corner of the \"L\"-shaped tRNA molecule. This structural motif contains a long alpha-helix, which extends along the entire length of the D and anticodon stems of the complexed tRNA. We suggest that the positioning of this helix relative to the dinucleotide fold plays a critical role in ensuring the proper global orientation of tRNA(Gln) on the surface of the enzyme. The structural correspondences suggest a similar overall orientation of binding of tRNA(Met) and tRNA(Gln) to their respective synthetases.\r"

Analysis of mature T-cell subsets revealed the absence of complete \"superantigen\"-mediated V beta deletions, suggesting that this phenomenon, in contrast to mouse, is uncommon or absent in humans. However, several V beta genes were over- or underexpressed in one or both mature single-positive (CD4+8- or CD8+4-) thymocyte subsets compared to syngeneic total, mostly immature thymocytes. Whether these changes are induced by relatively weak superantigens or conventional antigens and whether the downshifts are caused by negative selection or lack of positive selection remains to be determined.\r"

When administered during induction of the disease, TGF-beta 1 prevents CIA but only delays the onset of REAE by 2-3 days. However, when administered during a remission. TGF-beta 1 prevents the occurrence of relapses in REAE. The results suggest that TGF-beta 1 has powerful anti-inflammatory effects, mimicking in some respects the beneficial effects of immunosuppressive drugs in these experimental models of autoimmune disease, but without discernable adverse effects.\r"

Open probability of the O2-sensitive K+ channel reversibly decreased by at least 50% on exposure to hypoxia but single-channel conductance (approximately 20 pS) was unaltered. In the range between 70 and 150 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133 Pa) the decrease of single-channel open probability was proportional to the PO2 measured in the vicinity of the membrane patch. The inhibition of K+ channel activity by low PO2 was independent of the presence of non-hydrolyzable guanine triphosphate analogues at the internal face of the membrane. The results indicate that the O2 sensor of type I cells is in the plasma membrane and suggest that environmental O2 interacts directly with the K+ channels.\r"

Herein we examine the role of the repeat region in Shaker K+ channels through substitution of the leucines in the repeat and through coexpression of normal and truncated products. In contrast to leucine-zipper DNA-binding proteins, we find that the subunit assembly of Shaker does not depend on the leucine heptad repeat. Instead, we report that substitutions of the leucines in the repeat produce large effects on the observed voltage dependence of conductance voltage and prepulse inactivation curves. Our results suggest that the leucines mediate interactions that play an important role in the transduction of charge movement into channel opening and closing.\r"

  ".U": "91187906\r", 
  ".W": "The osteoclast is unique in its ability to resorb bone, and excessive osteoclastic activity has been implicated in osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, rheumatoid arthritis, and the growth of metastases in bone. The activity of this cell is controlled by the main circulating inhibitor, calcitonin, in association with locally produced modulators. We show that nitric oxide (NO) may be an important member of the latter group. NO is produced by the vascular endothelium and nervous system and is involved in both neurotransmission and the regulation of blood pressure. However, our results show that the autocoid is also a potent inhibitor of osteoclast function. NO (30 microM) produced a decrease to approximately 50% of the original osteoclast spread area. Similar effects were also produced by 3-morpholinosydnonimine or sodium nitroprusside, reagents that spontaneously release NO. These shape changes were associated with a reduction of bone resorption after a 24-hr incubation of isolated osteoclasts on devitalized bone slices. NO is thought to act by stimulating guanylate cyclase, with a consequent increase in cyclic GMP, but a different mode of action is likely in the osteoclast since dibutyryl or 8-bromo cyclic GMP have no effect. It should be noted that calcitonin can produce similar changes in shape and activity but is associated with an increase in osteoclast intracellular calcium and cessation of membrane movement; neither of these is produced by NO, suggesting that its mode of action is different. The abundance of NO-producing endothelial cells in bone marrow and their proximity to osteoclasts suggests that marrow endothelial cells may play a physiological role in the regulation of osteoclastic activity.\r"

  ".W": "Aspartylglycosaminuria is an inherited lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of glycoasparaginase (EC 3.5.1.26) and occurs with higher frequency among Finns than other populations. We have purified human glycoasparaginase and determined about 90% of the amino acid sequence of its light subunit and greater than 70% of that of its heavy subunit by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Additional sequence data were obtained from the cloning and subsequent nucleotide analysis of a cDNA corresponding to the normal human glycoasparaginase gene. The enzyme is encoded by a single mRNA as a single polypeptide that is posttranslationally processed to generate the subunits and is glycosylated. After preparing first-strand cDNA from leukocyte and fibroblast total RNA, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the glycoasparaginase cDNA of eight Finnish aspartylglycosaminuria patients. We demonstrate that the Finnish patients' mRNA sequence differed from the normal sequence by two single-base changes six nucleotides apart from one another in the heavy chain of glycoasparaginase. The first change resulted in the replacement of arginine by glutamine (R161Q), whereas the second change resulted in a cysteine to serine substitution (C163S). Both mutations resulted in novel restriction endonuclease sites and were present in all eight Finnish aspartylglycosaminuria patients originating from different pedigrees, but they were absent from Finnish and non-Finnish controls and a non-Finnish case of aspartylglycosaminuria. These results indicate molecular homogeneity in aspartylglycosaminuria alleles in the Finnish population.\r"

  ".U": "91187908\r", 
  ".W": "von Willebrand factor (vWF) supports platelet adhesion on thrombogenic surfaces by binding to platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib in the GP Ib-IX receptor complex. This interaction is physiologically regulated so that it does not occur between circulating vWF and platelets but, rather, only at a site of vascular injury. The abnormal vWF found in type IIB von Willebrand disease, however, has a characteristically increased affinity for GP Ib and binds to circulating platelets. We have analyzed the molecular basis of this abnormality by sequence analysis of a type IIB vWF cDNA and have identified a single amino acid change, Trp550 to Cys550, located in the GP Ib-binding domain of the molecule comprising residues 449-728. Bacterial expression of recombinant fragments corresponding to this vWF domain yielded molecules that, whether containing a normal Trp550 or a mutant Cys550 residue, bound directly to GP Ib in the absence of modulators and with similar affinity. In contrast, mammalian cell expression of the same segment of sequence yielded molecules that, when containing the normal Trp550, did not bind to GP Ib directly but, like native vWF, bound in the presence of ristocetin. However, molecules containing the point mutation (Cys550) behaved like type IIB vWF--namely, bound to GP Ib even without ristocetin modulation and, in the presence of ristocetin, had 10-fold higher affinity than molecules with normal sequence. These results identify a region of vWF that, although not thought to be directly involved in binding to GP Ib, may modulate the interaction through conformational changes.\r"

The shorter form (lacking the insert) predominates in fetal brain and peripheral tissues and appears to represent a nonneuronal receptor, whereas the longer form is found in adult brain and appears to be exclusively neuronal. The phosphorylation kinetics by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the phosphopeptide maps differ for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors purified from tissues predominantly expressing different forms of the transcript.\r"

  ".W": "Sexual activity is the primary method of transmission for several important parasitic diseases and has resulted in a significant prevalence of enteric parasitic infection among male homosexuals. The majority of parasitic sexually transmitted diseases involve protozoan pathogens; however, nematode and arthropod illnesses are also included in this group. Trichomoniasis, caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common parasitic STD. Infection with this organism typically results in the signs and symptoms of vaginitis. Trichomoniasis can be diagnosed in the office setting by performing a microscopic evaluation of infected vaginal secretions and can be successfully treated with metronidazole. Both pediculosis pubis, caused by the crab louse Pthirus pubis, and scabies, caused by the itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei, present with severe pruritus. A papular or vesicular rash and linear burrows seen in the finger webs and genital area are characteristic of scabies. Pediculosis pubis is diagnosed by observing adult lice or their nits in areas that bear coarse hair. The diagnosis of scabies is confirmed by scraping suspicious burrows and viewing the mite or its byproducts under the microscope. Lindane, 1% used in treating scabies, is also very effective for treating pediculosis pubis. Synthetic pyrethrins, also applied as a cream or lotion, are less toxic alternatives for the treatment of either condition. Oral-anal and oral-genital sexual practices predispose male homosexuals to infection with many enteric pathogens, including parasitic protozoans and helminths. The most common of these parasitic infections are amebiasis, caused by Entamoeba histolytica, and giardiasis caused by Giardia lamblia. Both entities may cause acute or chronic diarrhea, as well as other abdominal symptoms. Most gay men with amebiasis are asymptomatic, and invasive disease in this group is extremely rare. Both amebiasis and giardiasis can be diagnosed on the basis of microscopic examination of stool specimens, although duodenal aspiration is occasionally necessary to confirm a diagnosis of giardiasis. Multiple treatment regimens exist for amebiasis. Iodoquinol is a good choice for asymptomatic cyst carriers, whereas the combination of metronidazole plus iodoquinol is used for symptomatic patients. Quinacrine and metronidazole are both efficacious in the treatment of giardiasis.\r"

  ".W": "There are several protozoan infections that cause relatively benign illness in normal individuals but result in severe disease manifestations in patients with AIDS. These diseases include Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, CNS toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, and isosporiasis. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) caused by Pneumocystis carinii, is the most common opportunistic infection in AIDS. It is seen in more than 80% of individuals with this syndrome. Although historically classified as a protozoan, this organism shares many biochemical characteristics with fungi. The onset of PCP may be insidious, and cough and dyspnea are the most common presenting symptoms. Auscultation of the lungs is often unremarkable, but diffuse infiltrates are commonly seen on chest radiographs. The diagnosis of PCP can be confirmed by identifying the organism on specimens obtained by sputum induction or bronchoalveolar lavage. Trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole is the treatment of choice but is unfortunately associated with leukopenia and rash in many individuals. Both trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole and aerosolized pentamidine are used prophylactically in patients at high risk for initial or relapsing infection. The appropriate use of these agents has resulted in improved survival for AIDS patients with PCP. Toxoplasmosis, due to Toxoplasma gondii, affects the central nervous system in patients with AIDS. Headache is a common presenting symptom, and both seizures and paresis can occur. A diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is strongly suspected in symptomatic individuals with ringed mass lesions noted on head CT. Patients with this condition are treated with a combination of sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, and folinic acid. Cryptosporidiosis and isosporiasis are coccidian protozoan diseases that can result in severe, acute, and chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptosporidiosis is the more common of the two and is caused by an unknown species of the genus crytosporidium. Isosporiasis is due to infection with Isospora belli. Dehydration and weight loss are a common result of infection with either agent. A definitive diagnosis can be made by examining an acid fast stain of a diarrheal stool specimen and demonstrating oocysts that are specific for each of these organisms. Fluid replacement and general supportive care are essential in the treatment of both of these diseases. Spiramycin is an unproven treatment modality that is often used in patients with cryptosporidiosis. Isosporiasis responds to initial therapy with trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole, followed by prophylaxis with pyrimethamine. The adoption of safe sexual practices that minimize fecal-oral contamination should decrease the future prevalence of these diseases and other enteric parasitic infections.\r"

Toxocara canis (dog roundworm) and Toxocara cati (cat roundworm) are the ascarids most commonly responsible for VLM and ocular larva migrans in humans. These roundworms live in their adult stage in the small intestine of the dog and cat where their eggs are passed in the feces. The eggs containing the infective larva are very sticky, thus an infant crawling around on the floor can easily pick these up on fingers that almost invariably end up in the mouth. Infections are usually mild and asymptomatic but with a persistent eosinophilia. Ocular larva migrans is the form usually occurring in older children and adults. Some public health veterinarians recommend that a puppy or kitten should not be obtained as a companion for a child who is not old enough to read, thus bypassing the crawling and toddler stages. Hookworm eggs, shed in the feces of infected dogs or cats, develop into the infective second stage within a week. Humans are usually infected when bare areas of skin such as bare feet or the torso come in contact with soil contaminated with the larvae. The second-stage larvae are able to penetrate the intact skin of humans and the foot pads of dogs and cats. In the United States, the common dog hookworm, A. caninum, is a widespread parasite. Human intestinal ancylostomiasis caused by this species is rare, with only six cases recorded in the literature. Infection in humans or animals by the common tapeworm of dogs and cats (Dipylidium caninum) requires ingestion of the intermediate host, the dog or cat flea containing the larva (cysticercoids) of the agent. Many cases in humans are asymptomatic. Dipylidiasis affects mainly infants and young children who may swallow a flea that hops up while the infant is crawling on the floor or fondling the family pet. Humans appear to be highly resistant to the infection, given the high frequency of flea infestation on dogs and cats and the relative rarity of human disease. Pinworms of animal hosts are not transmissible to humans. Humans become an accidental host of dirofilaria when bitten by an infected mosquito, although the microfilaria will not mature to the adult form in humans. Radio-opaque coin-type lung lesions can be noted on radiographs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Symptoms of fever, chills, headache, and myalgia result from the invasion and rupture of erythrocytes. Merozoites are released from erythrocytes and invade other cells, thus propagating the infection. The most vulnerable hosts are nonimmune travelers, young children living in the tropics, and pregnant women. P. falciparum causes the most severe infections because it infects RBCs of all ages and has the propensity to develop resistance to antimalarials. Rapid diagnosis can be made with a malarial smear, and treatment should be initiated promptly. In some regions (Mexico, Central America except Panama, and North Africa) chloroquine phosphate is effective therapy. In subsaharan Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia, chloroquine resistance has become widespread, and other antimalarials are necessary. The primary care physician should have a high index of suspicion for malaria in the traveler returning from the tropics. Malaria should also be suspected in the febrile transfusion recipient and newborns of mothers with malaria.\r"
