Unfortunately, the ability to detect these agents in an outbreak can be limited by two factors: 1) the lack of appropriate assays-many of which are still in developmental stages and are not readily available to clinical laboratories, and 2) inadequately or improperly collected specimens. At CDC, many newly developed assays are being used for research and for outbreak investigations. The information in this report is especially intended for public health agencies that collaborate with CDC in investigating outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The report provides an update on guidelines and recommendations for the proper collection of specimens to be sent to CDC, gives general background information concerning some recently discovered pathogens, lists some of the tests available at CDC, and provides a list of CDC contacts. The guidelines and the general information provided on causes of outbreaks of gastroenteritis can be also used by public health workers for investigations when specific testing is available and appropriate.\r"

Amino acid sequencing of an anomalous peptide revealed an alanine-for-threonine substitution corresponding to position No. 60 of the transthyretin monomer. Detection of the FAP gene in asymptomatic carriers was accomplished by hybrid isoelectric focusing of transthyretin in the presence of dithiothreitol and high concentrations of urea, and by Southern blotting of Pvull-digested leukocyte deoxyribonucleic acid. This type of FAP was found to be identical to the previously described Appalachian amyloid. Patients with FAP and their asymptomatic gene-carrying offspring had significantly reduced levels of serum transthyretin and retinol-binding protein.\r"

  ".U": "91042842\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Oral contraceptives can induce changes in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism similar to those associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, including increased serum triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and insulin levels and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. In this study, we examined whether modification of the type or dose of progestin in oral-contraceptive preparations diminishes these changes. METHODS. We measured plasma lipoprotein levels and performed oral glucose-tolerance tests in a cross section of 1060 women who took one of nine types of oral contraceptives for at least three months and 418 women who took none. Seven of the contraceptive formulations contained various doses and types of progestin: levonorgestrel in low (150 micrograms), high (250 micrograms), and triphasic (50 to 125 micrograms) doses; norethindrone in low (500 micrograms), high (1000 micrograms), and triphasic (500 to 1000 micrograms) doses; and a new progestin, desogestrel, in one dose (150 micrograms). All seven contained 30 to 40 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol. Two additional formulations contained progestin alone. RESULTS. As compared with controls, women taking combination drugs did not have increased serum total cholesterol levels but did have increases of 13 to 75 percent in fasting triglyceride levels. Levels of LDL cholesterol were reduced by 14 percent in women taking the combination containing desogestrel and by 12 percent in those taking low-dose norethindrone. Levels of HDL cholesterol were lowered by 5 percent and 16 percent by the combinations containing low-dose and high-dose levonorgestrel, respectively; these decreases were due to reductions of 29 percent and 43 percent, respectively, in the levels of HDL subclass 2. The combination pill containing high-dose norethindrone did not affect HDL cholesterol levels, whereas that containing low-dose norethindrone increased HDL cholesterol levels by 10 percent. The desogestrel combination increased HDL cholesterol levels by 12 percent. Levels of apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, and B were generally increased by combination drugs. Depending on the dose and type of progestin, combination drugs were associated with plasma glucose levels on the glucose-tolerance test that were 43 to 61 percent higher than in controls, insulin responses 12 to 40 percent higher, and C-peptide responses 18 to 45 percent higher. Progestin-only formulations had only minor metabolic effects. CONCLUSIONS. The appropriate dose and type of progestin may reduce the adverse effects of oral contraceptives on many metabolic markers of risk for coronary heart disease. Progestin-only formulations or combinations containing desogestrel or low-dose norethindrone were associated wtih the most favorable profiles.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We report the results of the Heparin-Aspirin Reperfusion Trial, a collaborative study comparing early intravenous heparin with oral aspirin as adjunctive treatment when recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is used for coronary thrombolysis during acute myocardial infarction. METHODS. Two hundred five patients were randomly assigned to receive either immediate and then continuous intravenous heparin (starting with a 5000-unit bolus; n = 106) or immediate and then daily oral aspirin (80 mg; n = 99) together with rt-PA (100 mg intravenously over a six-hour period) initiated within six hours of the onset of symptoms. We evaluated the patency of the infarct-related artery by angiography 7 to 24 hours after beginning rt-PA infusion, the frequency of reocclusion of the artery by repeat angiography on day 7, and ischemic or hemorrhagic complications during the hospital stay. RESULTS. At the time of the first angiogram, 82 percent of the infarct-related arteries in the patients assigned to heparin were patent, as compared with only 52 percent in the aspirin group (P less than 0.0001). Of the initially patent vessels, 88 percent remained patent after seven days in the heparin group, as compared with 95 percent in the aspirin group (P not significant). The numbers of hemorrhagic events (18 in the heparin and 15 in the aspirin group) and recurrent ischemic events (8 in the heparin and 2 in the aspirin group) were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Coronary patency rates associated with rt-PA are higher with early concomitant systemic heparin treatment than with concomitant low-dose oral aspirin. This observation has important implications for clinical practice and should be considered in the design and interpretation of clinical trials involving coronary thrombolytic therapy.\r"

We designed, and here report on the efficacy of, a noninvasive ventilatory-assistance apparatus to provide inspiratory-pressure support by means of a face mask. METHODS. We assessed the short-term (45-minute) physiologic effects of the apparatus in 11 patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and evaluated its therapeutic efficacy in 13 such patients (including 3 of the 11 in the physiologic study) who were treated for several days and compared with 13 matched historical-control patients. RESULTS. In the physiologic study, after 45 minutes of inspiratory positive airway pressure by face mask, the mean (+/- SD) arterial pH rose from 7.31 +/- 0.08 to 7.38 +/- 0.07 (P less than 0.01), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide fell from 68 +/- 17 mm Hg to 55 +/- 15 mm Hg (P less than 0.01), and the partial pressure of oxygen rose from 52 +/- 12 mm Hg to 69 +/- 16 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). These changes were accompanied by marked reductions in respiratory rate (from 31 +/- 7 to 21 +/- 9 breaths per minute, P less than 0.01). Only 1 of the 13 patients treated with inspiratory positive airway pressure needed tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, as compared with 11 of the 13 historical controls (P less than 0.001). Two patients in each group died. As compared with the controls, the treated patients had a more transient need for ventilatory assistance (3 +/- 1 vs. 12 +/- 11 days, P less than 0.01) and a shorter stay in the intensive care unit (7 +/- 3 vs. 19 +/- 13 days, P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. Inspiratory positive airway pressure delivered by a face mask can obviate the need for conventional mechanical ventilation in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r"

The predicted amino-acid sequence of the segregation protein was shown recently to be strikingly similar to Drosophila kinesin heavy chain. We have expressed the claret segregation protein in bacteria and have found that the bacterially expressed protein has motor activity in vitro with several novel features. The claret motor is slow (4 microns min-1), unlike either kinesin or dyneins. It has the directionality, the ability to generate torque and the sensitivity to inhibitors reported previously for dyneins. The finding of minus-end directed motor activity for a protein with sequence similarity to kinesin suggests that the dynein and kinesin motor domains are ancestrally related. The minus-end directed motor activity of the claret motor is consistent with a role for this protein in producing chromosome movement along spindle microtubules during prometaphase and/or anaphase.\r"

Many loci affecting quantitative traits have been identified by the segregation of mutant alleles with major qualitative effects. These alleles may represent an extreme of a continuum of allelic effects, and most quantitative variation could result from the segregation of alleles with subtle effects at loci identified by alleles with major effects. The achaete-scute complex in Drosophila melanogaster plays a central part in bristle development and has been characterized at the molecular level. The hypothesis that naturally occurring quantitative variation in bristle number could be associated with wild-type alleles of achaete-scute was tested by correlating phenotypic variation in bristle number with molecular variation in restriction maps in this region among chromosomes extracted from natural populations. DNA insertion variation in the achaete-scute region was found to be strongly associated with variation in bristle number.\r"

  ".U": "91043051\r", 
  ".W": "Proto-oncogene fos encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein of 380 amino acids that can modulate the transcription of other genes either by transactivation or by transrepression. The v-Fos protein (381 amino acids) shares the first 332 amino acids with the c-Fos protein (with five single amino-acid changes), but differs at the C terminus. We have previously reported that the c-Fos protein undergoes more extensive post-translational modification than v-Fos (refs 9, 10). The major modification of the c-Fos protein involves serine phosphoesterification of sites in the extreme C terminus. We therefore argued that modification of the C-terminal region of the c-Fos protein may be involved in its ability to transrepress transcription without compromising its ability to transactivate other genes. Here we show that mutant c-Fos protein which is hypophosphorylated at its C terminus is unable to repress transcription of the c-fos promoter following induction with serum or tetraphorbol acetate. The C-terminal phosphorylation-deficient mutant is, however, fully competent to activate transcription of promoters containing a phorbol response element. The requirement for phosphorylation can be offset by the introduction of a net negative charge in the C terminus of the Fos protein.\r"

Proposed reaction pathways for the catalytic cycle of the O2 reduction are difficult to verify without knowing the structures of the intermediates, but we now have such information for the catalytic intermediates in the first steps of the reaction of O2 with cytochrome c oxidase from resonance Raman spectroscopy, a technique that enables iron-ligand stretching modes to be identified. Here we report on two more key intermediates: a ferryl-oxo (Fe4 = O2-) and a ferric-hydroxy (Fe3+--OH-) intermediate at the level of 3- and 4-electron reduction, respectively. We identified these intermediates by their characteristic iron-oxygen stretching frequencies (786 cm-1 for Fe4+ = O2-, and 450 cm-1 for Fe3+ -- OH-) and oxygen and deuterium isotope shifts. The oxo atom in the ferryl intermediate is hydrogen-bonded and the iron-oxygen bond in the hydroxy intermediate is anomalously weak. With the identification of the primary, ferryl and hydroxy intermediates, the predominant structures at almost all stages of O2 reduction are now known and the catalytic pathway can be described with more certainty.\r"

  ".U": "91043090\r", 
  ".W": "Glycine is an important inhibitory transmitter in the brainstem and spinal cord. In the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (medullary dorsal horn) and in the spinal dorsal horn (the relaying centres for processing pain and sensory information), glycine inhibits the glutamate-evoked depolarization and depresses firing of neurons. The binding of glycine to its receptor produces a large increase in Cl- conductance, which causes membrane hyperpolarization. The selectivity and gating properties of glycine receptor channels have been well characterized; the glycine receptor molecules have also been purified. The amino-acid sequence, deduced from complementary DNA clones encoding one of the peptides (the 48K subunit), shows significant homology with gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits, suggesting that glycine receptors may belong to a superfamily of chemically gated channel proteins. However, very little is known about the modulation of glycine receptor channels. We have investigated the regulation of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor channels by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in neurons isolated from spinal trigeminal nucleus of rat and report here that the protein kinase A dramatically increased the glycine-induced Cl- currents by increasing the probability of the channel openings. GS protein, which is sensitive to cholera toxin, was involved in the modulation.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to determine the response of brain water and electrolytes to acute hypo-osmolality and hyperosmolality in animals with intact skulls and dura, in comparison with those subjected to extensive bilateral or unilateral craniectomy and opening of the dura. In rats, 4 to 5 weeks after extensive unilateral or bilateral craniectomy and opening of the dura, a 50-mOsm/kg decrease in plasma osmolality was produced by systemic administration of distilled water (\"water intoxication\"), or a 28-mOsm/kg increase in plasma osmolality was produced by systemic administration of either 1 M NaCl or 1 M mannitol in 0.34 M NaCl. Tissue water, Na. and K contents were determined after 120 minutes. Tissue water accumulation or water loss was proportional to the decrease or increase in plasma osmolality. The tissue water accumulation after \"water intoxication,\" however, was less (40% of the predicted value) than that predicted for ideal osmotic behavior. The brain tissue was also found to shrink less than predicted on the basis of ideal osmotic behavior (40% of the predicted value after mannitol treatment, and 60% after NaCl administration). This nonideal osmotic response of the brain tissue is consistent with the finding in other studies and indicated a significant degree of volume regulation. Water and electrolyte changes did not differ between animals operated on and those not operated on, a fact which demonstrates that there are no effects of extensive skull and dura defects on tissue volume regulation under hypo- and hyperosmolar conditions encountered under clinical circumstances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91043536\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred fifty-three patients with medically refractory partial epilepsy underwent chronic stereotactic depth-electrode EEG (SEEG) evaluations after being studied by positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and scalp-sphenoidal EEG telemetry. We carried out retrospective standardized reviews of local cerebral metabolism and scalp-sphenoidal ictal onsets to determine when SEEG recordings revealed additional useful information. FDG-PET localization was misleading in only 3 patients with temporal lobe SEEG ictal onsets for whom extratemporal or contralateral hypometabolism could be attributed to obvious nonepileptic structural defects. Two patients with predominantly temporal hypometabolism may have had frontal epileptogenic regions, but ultimate localization remains uncertain. Scalp-sphenoidal ictal onsets were misleading in 5 patients. For 37 patients with congruent focal scalp-sphenoidal ictal onsets and temporal hypometabolic zones, SEEG recordings never demonstrated extratemporal or contralateral epileptogenic regions; however, 3 of these patients had nondiagnostic SEEG evaluations. The results of subsequent subdural grid recordings indicated that at least 1 of these patients may have been denied beneficial surgery as a result of an equivocal SEEG evaluation. Weighing risks and benefits, it is concluded that anterior temporal lobectomy is justified without chronic intracranial recording when specific criteria for focal scalp-sphenoidal ictal EEG onsets are met, localized hypometabolism predominantly involves the same temporal lobe, and no other conflicting information has been obtained from additional tests of focal functional deficit, structural imaging, or seizure semiology.\r"

The number of ovulatory cycles was 18 of 24 (75%) with naltrexone and eight of 24 (33%) with placebo (P less than .05). Most luteal phases were short. In five normally menstruating women, we gave either naltrexone or placebo in the luteal phase using a crossover blinded scheme. Steroidogenesis in the normal luteal phase was not impaired by naltrexone therapy. In functional hypothalamic amenorrheic patients with normal weight, menstruation might be restored by either placebo or naltrexone, but naltrexone provides a clinical and therapeutic advantage by increasing the ovulation rate.\r"

Both drugs caused dose-dependent inhibition of fibroblast proliferation. These effects were reversible at lower doses (0.33 mg/l of 5-FU, 1.0 X 10(-3) mg/l of MMC) and at an early stage of treatment, but became irreversible at higher doses or after longer treatment times. The degree of growth inhibition reached a plateau after 7 days of treatment. Neither drug altered fibroblast migration in the agarose droplet motility assay or on the intra-cytoplasmic actin distribution by epifluorescent-light microscopy. These results indicate that 5-FU and MMC inhibit subconjunctival fibroblast function predominantly by their effect on cell proliferation rather than on cell motility. The clinical implications of these results may possibly support the use of a much lower total dose of subconjunctival antimetabolite than used in the 5-FU clinical trial.\r"

Site samples were taken of entrance, developer, fixer, water, and exit surfaces. Measurements of processing effects were accomplished by intentional contamination of films run in series through an automatic processor. Site samples were again taken of the processor. In the clinical setting colony-forming units increased with activity. Radiographic processing after intentional contamination decreased colony-forming units on films, but they increased for all processing solutions. Bacteria on radiographic film survived processing. Although processing procedures significantly reduce the number of bacteria on films, the potential for contamination and cross-contamination remains.\r"

It is not unusual for a patient to have more than one indication for this procedure. Some epiglottic cancers invade the pre-epiglottic space. This crucial information may not be detectable by MRI or CT scanning techniques. Laser epiglottectomy provides a method to explore and perform a biopsy of the pre-epiglottic space and thereby stage these lesions accurately. There are no significant problems with postoperative alimentation, airway, or voice. Any form of primary or adjuvant therapy can be started without delay.\r"

These factors were applied to data gathered on seven normal subjects who had three trials of facial-nerve ENOG on three separate test days in order to determine an optimal recording electrode montage. Both bipolar and monopolar recording-electrode montages were used on the nasal alae and on the nasolabial crease. Resultant peak-to-peak amplitudes of combined motor action potentials were recorded and measured using a clinical evoked-potential instrument. A biphasic waveform shape with optimal peak-to-peak point rather than the nasolabial crease. The contribution to the assessment of response reliability of each of the four factors is discussed.\r"

Between 1983 and 1986, a pterional (or subtemporal) approach was combined with such conventional anterolateral procedures as a mandibulopharyngectomy, maxillectomy, orbitectomy, and parotidectomy in 13 patients with advanced skull base lesions. The tumor origin was extracranial in ten cases and intracranial in three patients. Seven of the neoplasms were malignant and six were histologically benign. Complete tumor removal was achieved in all patients. Repair of the ablative defect was achieved with a temporalis myogenous flap in ten patients, and primary closure or distant myocutaneous flaps in the remaining three patients. Postoperative complications included three lateral nasocutaneous fistulae secondary to temporalis myogenous flap necrosis and isolated cases of stroke, cerebral edema, pneumocephalus, and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. Twelve patients are alive without evidence of disease at a mean interval of 25 months. The remaining patient died from lung metastases 11 months after surgery.\r"

Seven of 37 samples (19%) were positive for estrogen receptor and six of 36 samples (17%) were positive for progesterone receptor. Three of 37 samples (8%) were positive for both receptors. There was no correlation of estrogen receptor positivity with the sex of the patient. These results indicate that estrogen or progesterone receptor binding activity or both are present in a small subset of acoustic tumors. Evidence is lacking, however, that binding of estrogen to the receptor results in growth changes in the tumor. The empirical use of antiestrogen treatment in acoustic neuroma does not appear to be justified at the present time.\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage in the patient who has undergone an adenotonsillectomy because of an unrecognized hemostatic defect may increase morbidity and can be potentially life-threatening to the patient in what should be a \"routine\" procedure. Preoperative identification of occult hemostatic abnormalities, coupled with perioperative management directed at correcting the effects of the defects, should serve to reduce the incidence of this distressful complication. Routine use of preoperative laboratory screening tests for this purpose has been discouraged recently as a result of concerns over cost-effectiveness and the low predictiveness of the tests for bleeding. Our experience with the routine use of a comprehensive hemostatic laboratory screening panel--which includes a bleeding time test--in the adenotonsillectomy patient population demonstrated that 11.5% of our patients had abnormal initial screening laboratory tests; these results were ultimately attributable to occult hemostatic defects. Clinical history, the universally recommended method of preoperative hemostatic assessment, failed to detect any previously unrecognized coagulation disorder. Laboratory screening improved preoperative detection of occult hemostatic defects and allowed for appropriate alterations in perioperative care. Our results with this approach are presented, along with illustrative case histories and a discussion of the current recommendations for preoperative laboratory screening of the hemostatic system, as found in a review of the literature.\r"

  ".W": "The incisor absent (ia) rat is introduced as an animal model for the study of otosclerosis. Previous animal models have failed to accurately reflect the dynamic nature of this disease. Auditory brainstem response testing suggested a conductive hearing loss in the incisor absent rat as compared to age-matched normal controls. The hearing loss, which was manifested during puberty, was progressive in nature up to 18 weeks of age. Microscopic dissection of the middle ear revealed bony abnormalities of the ossicles and oval window in the incisor absent rat. Scanning electron microscopy of the ossicles demonstrated bony lesions at the incudostapedial joint and stapes footplate. Histologic examination demonstrated thickened spongiotic bone involving the otic capsule and ossicles. The incisor absent rat model possesses an inheritable defect of the otic capsule and ossicles that results in a progressive conductive hearing loss. The genetically transmitted lesion appears histologically similar to otospongiosis. The bony pathology in the incisor absent rat is caused by defective osteoclasts and transplantation of bone marrow cells from normal rats to the incisor absent rats corrects the cellular abnormality. The incisor absent rat may represent the best animal model to date for the study of otosclerosis, its cause, and clinical treatment.\r"

In each subject, 150 ciliary beats were analyzed from each of 50 separate ciliated cell clusters. The ciliary beat frequency for each area was determined with fast Fourier transformation. The results were plotted on a histogram to determine the ciliary beat distribution. The mean frequency for these samples was 11.29 Hz, with a standard deviation of 0.96 Hz. The median frequency for these samples was 11.25 Hz. These results show a marked improvement over hand-counting microphotometry techniques because of the much larger sampling size and elimination of much human error. We believe this method of ciliary analysis represents a significant advancement in the evaluation of ciliary function and should assist in the diagnosis of patients with congenital and acquired forms of ciliary dysmotility.\r"

Measurements from 45 kittens (85 temporal bones) were obtained from the pars tensa region of the tympanic membrane and the stapedial footplate region bounded by the annular ligament using standard macrophotographic and computer digitization techniques. Tympanic membrane and stapedial footplate areas were approximately 70% and 80%, respectively, of their adult size at birth and relevant areas increased exponentially during early postnatal life. Adultlike dimensions were achieved by the end of the first postnatal week. Tympanic membrane:stapedial footplate areal ratios increased from approximately 25:1 to 30:1 during the first postnatal week, before the developmental period during which adultlike auditory thresholds and response amplitudes are acquired. Thus, the areal ratio influences on impedance-matching characteristics of the middle ear do not appear to significantly affect the postnatal development of auditory function in cats.\r"

Thirty-four dogs were studied with electric direct cortical stimulation through a craniotomy and magnetic transcranial stimulation of the facial motor cortex. Facial nerve stimulation in the cerebellopontine angle allowed comparison to cortical responses. Latencies of 6.08 and 9.52 msec for orbicularis oculi and levator nasolabialis, respectively, were determined with magnetic transcranial stimulation, compared with 4.22 and 5.78 msec with electric direct cortical stimulation. In conclusion, magnetic stimulation of the facial motor cortex is possible in dogs, with longer central conduction times than with electric direct stimulation.\r"

However, no published study to date has documented functional recovery of these regenerated sensory receptor cells. Newborn chicks were treated with gentamicin sulfate (50 mg/kg/day) for a total of either 5 (n = 10) or 10 (n = 76) days. Evoked potential thresholds were obtained one day after the 5-day treatment, or at intervals between one day and 20 weeks after the 10-day treatment course, and compared to thresholds of age-matched control animals. A significant hearing loss, predominantly in the high frequencies, was present after as few as 5 days of drug administration. The magnitude of hearing loss continued to increase, especially at lower frequencies, as survival increased from 1 day to 5 weeks after gentamicin treatment. Sixteen-to-20 weeks after treatment, partial recovery of thresholds was evident. These findings demonstrate that functional recovery does occur in the avian inner ear following aminoglycoside administration. Recovery occurs at all frequencies, but predominantly at low and middle frequencies, leaving significant residual high-frequency threshold elevation. Recovery lags 14 to 18 weeks behind anatomic evidence of hair cell regeneration, which was demonstrated in one study by 2 weeks after comparable administration of gentamicin.\r"

Four of these patients were found to have inverted papillomas coincidentally in surgical specimens resected for squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma were found to be in older age groups, were more likely to manifest epistaxis than the more common unilateral nasal obstructive symptoms, and had less time between the onset of symptoms and presentation than those with inverted papillomas alone. The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of inverted papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas in association with inverted papillomas are discussed.\r"

This may be caused by either the aging process or trauma, both surgical and nonsurgical. Rhinolift is a surgical procedure that was developed for the treatment of the aging ptotic nasal tip. We have applied this technique to patients with nasal airway obstruction resulting from alar collapse. Elevation of the cephalic margin of the lobular cartilage to a position superficial to the upper lateral cartilage restores the normal relationship between these two structures. The upper lateral cartilage then assists in stenting the vestibule open, and thereby improves nasal breathing. Over the past 10 years, 20 patients have had rhinolifts at our institution for the relief of nasal airway obstruction. Concomitant surgery included nasal septal reconstruction in 12 patients, polypectomy in one patient, and placement of a silicone rubber septal prosthesis for closure of a large septal perforation in three patients. Rhinolift was the sole procedure used for the correction of valvular pathology in 10 patients. The other 10 patients had modifications made in their upper lateral cartilage along with the rhinolift. Five patients described restoration of normal nasal breathing, while 14 patients showed partial symptomatic improvement. One patient reported no improvement in nasal breathing. Rhinolift is a safe effective surgical technique for functional improvement of nasal breathing in patients with alar collapse resulting from inadequate cartilaginous support.\r"

The adjustable supraglottiscope: (1) provides wide exposure of the supraglottis and much of the lower pharynx, (2) allows instruments to be introduced from the side (between the blades), (3) allows for true suspension, and (4) retracts the endotracheal tube out of the way. These factors provide greater visualization and control of the surgical field and thus improve hemostasis and precision. The adjustable supraglottiscope has been used successfully in a variety of clinical situations. Transoral supraglottic surgery now takes considerably less time and is done with much greater ease. The adjustable supraglottiscope is a valuable instrument in our armamentarium and extends our versatility for endoscopic management of lesions of the supraglottic larynx and lower pharynx.\r"

From 52,691 individual electron microscopic observations, a virus was detected in 16% of specimens, and the yearly positive detection rate among centers ranged from 8 to 34%. Rotavirus was the agent most commonly observed (26 to 83%), followed by adenoviruses (8 to 27%, respiratory and enteric combined), and small round viruses (SRVs) (0 to 40%) which were second most common at two of the centers. Rotavirus and astrovirus detections occurred more often in the winter but seasonal trends in detection were not apparent for the other viruses. Of all astroviruses detected 64% were found in infants (less than 1 year); unlike the other agents studied SRVs were detected in a large percentage of infants (48%) and older children and adults (20%). Among hospitalized patients a majority of all astroviruses, caliciviruses and SRVs were detected 7 days or more after admission in contrast to both rotaviruses and adenoviruses which were more likely to be detected earlier. The data suggest that SRVs are common agents of gastroenteritis and may be important causes of nosocomial infections. Because of the relative insensitivity of direct electron microscopy as a screening method for SRVs, astroviruses and caliciviruses, these data probably underestimate the true prevalence of disease caused by these agents.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effects of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin in 18 infants who underwent ECMO therapy for severe respiratory failure and received gentamicin for possible sepsis. Twelve of these infants continued to receive gentamicin after ECMO had been discontinued. The volume of distribution (Vd) of gentamicin in the newborns receiving ECMO was 0.58 +/- 0.04 liter/kg, compared with a Vd of 0.45 +/- 0.02 liter/kg after ECMO had been discontinued (P = 0.02). The clearance of gentamicin in the patients undergoing ECMO was 42 +/- 3 ml/kg/hour compared with 57 +/- 4 ml/kg/hour in those patients off ECMO (P = 0.003). The elimination half-life in patients receiving ECMO was 10.0 +/- 0.7 hours compared with 5.7 +/- 0.4 hours after ECMO had been discontinued (P less than 0.0001). Neonates undergoing ECMO demonstrate a higher volume of distribution of gentamicin, a lower clearance, and consequently a longer half life for this drug. We conclude that gentamicin and probably other aminoglycosides should be given at dose rates about 25% lower than usual and at longer dosing intervals in patients undergoing ECMO therapy.\r"

Forty healthy children were followed prospectively and compared with 70 children with 43 episodes of nontypable H. influenzae, 21 episodes of S. pneumoniae and 28 episodes of M. catarrhalis otitis media. Carriage of nontypable H. influenzae (95% vs. 65%, P less than 0.001), S. pneumoniae (91% vs. 52%, P less than 0.005) and M. catarrhalis (86% vs. 52%, P less than 0.001) increased significantly during episodes of otitis media compared with healthy periods. The quantity of nontypable H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis in nasopharyngeal secretions also increased during active infection compared with healthy periods: 3.0 vs. 2.0, P less than 0.005; 3.2 vs. 2.1, P less than 0.001; and 3.3 vs. 2.5, P less than 0.01, respectively. At the same time, nonpathogens of the resident flora, in particular viridans streptococci, declined in carriage: 65% vs. 22%, P less than 0.001. These data suggest that respiratory pathogens become relatively more important in the microenvironment of the nasopharynx during episodes of otitis media. Furthermore the absence of a middle ear pathogen in a nasopharyngeal culture strongly suggests that the pathogen is not present in the middle ear space (negative predictive value greater than 0.96).\r"

Moreover, data obtained from the same mothers show that birth intervals preceded by breast-feeding were longer than those preceded by formula-feeding of the previous infant.

One is a recombinant between C mu and C gamma 1 (gamma 1 circle), and the other is a recombinant between C gamma 1 and C epsilon (epsilon circle). In the epsilon circle, a short piece of switch mu (S mu) sequence was inserted between S epsilon and S gamma 1 sequences. The inserted S mu sequence could be a trace of the preceding switch from C mu to C gamma 1. These findings indicate that parasitic infection can induce class switch recombinations in a successive manner, first from C mu to C gamma 1, and then from C gamma 1 to C epsilon.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated neonatal cardiac myocytes have been utilized as a model for the study of cardiac arrhythmogenic factors. The myocytes respond to the toxic effects of a potent cardiac glycoside, ouabain at 0.1 mM, by an increase in their spontaneous beating rate and a reduction in amplitude of contractions resulting within minutes in a lethal state of contracture. Incubating the isolated myocytes for 3-5 days in culture medium enriched with 5 microM arachidonic acid [20:4 (n-6)] had no effect on the development of lethal contracture after subsequent exposure to 0.1 mM ouabain. By contrast, incubating the myocytes for 3-5 days with 5 microM eicosapentaenoic acid [20:5 (n-3)] completely prevented the toxic effects of ouabain at 0.1 mM. There were no measurable differences in the degree to which ouabain inhibited Na,K-ATPase activity by comparing the control with the arachidonic acid- or the eicosapentaenoic acid-enriched myocytes. No differences in bumetanide-inhibitable 86Rb flux were observed between the three preparations. However, measurements with fura-2 of cytosolic free calcium levels indicated that control and arachidonic acid-enriched myocytes developed toxic cytosolic calcium concentrations of 845 +/- 29 and 757 +/- 64 nM, respectively, on exposure to 0.1 mM ouabain, whereas in eicosapentaenoic acid-enriched myocytes, physiologic calcium levels (214 +/- 29 nM) were preserved. Incubating the myocytes with eicosapentaenoic acid (5 microM) for 3-5 days resulted in a small reduction of arachidonic acid and a small but significant increase of eicosapentaenoic acid in membrane phospholipids of the myocytes.\r"

Treatment of AtT-20 cells with IL-1 induced a transient and early stimulation of mRNA expression by both immediate-early protooncogenes Fos and Jun (mouse c-fos and c-jun). The effect appeared within 30 min, and returned to basal levels after 2 hr. Desensitization of protein kinase C by phorbol ester pretreatment had no effect on the ability of IL-1 to induce Fos and Jun mRNA expression. Somatostatin, an inhibitor of cAMP and beta-endorphin secretion, did not reduce the IL-1 effect on Fos and Jun mRNA expression. Addition to AtT-20 cells of antisense oligonucleotides to Fos and Jun abolished the secretion induced by IL-1. These results indicate that immediate-early signals Fos and Jun are involved in IL-1-induced beta-endorphin secretion in AtT-20 cells.\r"

  ".W": "Docosahexaenoic acid [22:6(n-3); 22:6(4,-7,10,13,16,19) (DHA)] is required in quantity by the developing nervous system of the fetus. This need could be met through synthesis of DHA from linolenic acid in the fetus or through placental transfer of DHA directly. To study the placental transfer of n-3 fatty acids, we obtained umbilical and maternal blood samples from 26 healthy women and infants at parturition and measured the fatty acid composition and content of both plasma and erythrocytes. A striking finding was a considerable venous-arterial difference for DHA in the umbilical erythrocytes as a proportion of total fatty acids and in absolute concentration. This difference of 2.2 micrograms per billion erythrocytes was 6 times larger than the difference in fetal plasma, when the plasma and erythrocyte concentrations were normalized to whole blood. Most other erythrocyte fatty acids showed a similar trend. In umbilical plasma, significant venous-arterial differences were found for 16:0, 16:1, 18:2, and total saturated fatty acids. There was a similar trend for most other plasma fatty acids. Compared with maternal blood, fetal plasma and erythrocytes had higher levels of 20:4 and DHA and lower levels of 18:2 and 18:3(n - 3) fatty acids as a proportion of total fatty acids. These results suggest that erythrocytes play a major role in the necessary transport of the essential fatty acid DHA into the fetus.\r"

As such, it is possible that polymorphisms in one or more of these genes may alter susceptibility to autoimmune disease. We have searched extensively for a probe related to a developmentally regulated V gene that has the power to differentiate among highly homologous V genes in human populations. Using such a probe (i.e., Humhv3005/P1) related to both anti-DNA and anti-IgG autoantibodies, we studied restriction fragment length polymorphisms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus and found an apparent heavy-chain V (VH) gene deletion that was nearly restricted to the autoimmune patients. These data suggest that deletions of physiologically important VH genes may increase the risk of autoimmunity through indirect effects on the development and homeostasis of the B-cell repertoire.\r"

Apple ACC synthase was purified with an immunoaffinity gel, and its active site was probed with NaB3H4 or Ado[14C]Met. HPLC separation of the trypsin digest yielded a single radioactive peptide. Peptide sequencing of both 3H- and 14C-labeled peptides revealed a common dodecapeptide of Ser-Leu-Ser-Xaa-Asp-Leu-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gly-Phe-Arg, where Xaa was the modified, radioactive residue in each case. Acid hydrolysis of the 3H-labeled enzyme released radioactive N-pyridoxyllysine, indicating that the active-site peptide contained lysine at position 4. Mass spectrometry of the 14C-labeled peptide indicated a protonated molecular ion at m/z 1390.6, from which the mass of Xaa was calculated to be 229, a number that is equivalent to the mass of a lysine residue alkylated by the 2-aminobutyrate portion of AdoMet, as we previously proposed. These results indicate that the same active-site lysine binds the PLP and convalently links to the 2-aminobutyrate portion of AdoMet during inactivation. The active site of tomato ACC synthase was probed in the same manner with Ado[14C]Met. Sequencing of the tomato active-site peptide revealed two highly conserved dodecapeptides; the minor peptide possessed a sequence identical to that of the apple enzyme, whereas the major peptide differed from the minor peptide in that methionine replaced leucine at position 6.\r"

  ".W": "The dominant insulin-stimulated ribosomal protein S6 kinase activity was purified to near homogeneity from insulin-treated 32P-labeled rat H4 hepatoma cells and found to copurify with a 70-kDa 32P-labeled polypeptide. The dominant S6 kinase purified from livers of cycloheximide-treated rats is also a 70-kDa polypeptide. Antiserum raised against rat liver S6 kinase specifically immunoprecipitates the purified 32P-labeled H4 hepatoma insulin-stimulated S6 kinase. This antiserum also specifically precipitates insulin-stimulated S6 kinase activity directly from cytosolic extracts of H4 cells. Immune complexes prepared from the cytosol of 32P-labeled H4 cells contain several 32P-labeled polypeptides; only a 70-kDA 32P-labeled peptide, however, is specifically displaced by preadsorption of the antiserum with nonradioactive rat liver S6 kinase. Insulin treatment increases the 32P content of the immunoprecipitated 70-kDa S6 kinase polypeptide 3- to 4-fold over basal levels; 32P-labeled serine, some 32P-labeled threonine, but no 32P-labeled tyrosine are detected after partial acid hydrolysis. Tryptic peptide maps indicate that the insulin-stimulated S6 kinase purified from 32P-labeled H4 cells is phosphorylated at multiple sites distinct from those which participate in autophosphorylation in vitro. Autophosphorylation of rat liver S6 kinase in vitro does not modify S6 kinase activity. The S6 kinases purified from liver of cycloheximide-treated rat and H4 hepatoma insulin-stimulated enzyme are each completely deactivated by incubation with protein phosphatase type 2A in both autophosphorylating and 40S S6 phosphorylating activities. The phosphatase 2A-deactivated 70-kDa S6 kinase is neither reactivated nor phosphorylated by partially purified insulin-stimulated microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase, in experiments where Xenopus S6 kinase II undergoes phosphorylation and partial reactivation. Thus insulin activates the 70-kDa S6 kinase by promoting phosphorylation of specific serine/threonine residues on the enzyme polypeptide, probably through activating an as-yet-unidentified serine/threonine protein kinase distinct from microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase.\r"

Functionally different G proteins have been identified by their different alpha subunits. The beta and gamma subunits have been assumed to constitute a common pool shared among various G protein heterotrimers. Two gamma subunits (gamma 3 and gamma 4) have been identified through molecular cloning; these are in addition to two subunits (gamma 1 and gamma 2) that were previously characterized. G proteins purified from a variety of mammalian tissues were examined with antisera specific to three of the gamma subunits. The antisera react with different gamma subunits associated with some of the purified G proteins but not all. This demonstrates that different G protein heterotrimers from different tissues carry structurally distinct members of the gamma-subunit family. Diversity in the structure of the gamma as well as the alpha and beta subunits and preferential associations between members of subunit families increase structural and possibly functional diversity of G proteins.\r"

  ".W": "HeT DNA is a complex family of repeated DNA found only in pericentric and telomeric heterochromatin. In contrast to other DNA families that have been specifically associated with heterochromatin, HeT DNA is not principally a family of tandemly repeated elements. Much of the HeT DNA family appears to be a mosaic of several different classes of large sequence elements arranged in a scrambled array; however, some elements of the family can be found in tandem repeats. In spite of the variable order of the different elements in HeT DNA, the sequence homology between different members of each class of element is extremely high, suggesting that the members are evolving in a concerted fashion. Sequence analysis suggests that some elements in the HeT family may make up a novel family of heterochromatin-specific transposable elements and that the mosaic organization of the elements may be produced by retroposition and other mechanisms involved in the transposition of mobile elements. We suggest that such mechanisms may be a general feature for the maintenance of chromosome structure.\r"

  ".U": "91045926\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously identified a membrane factor capable of stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange activity for ras p21 proteins. The ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (rGEF) was purified from bovine brain to near homogeneity by successive chromatographies on DE52 DEAE-cellulose, Sepharose 6B, hydroxylapatite, and FPLC phenyl-Superose resins. SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified rGEF showed a single major protein with a molecular mass of 35 kDa. rGEF increased the exchange rate of GDP in normal [Gly12]p21 or oncogenic [Val12]p21 up to 30- to 40-fold under physiological concentrations of Mg2+. Since the factor was free from GDP/GTP binding activity and nonspecific GDP hydrolytic activity, we propose that rGEF may regulate GDP/GTP exchange reaction of ras proteins in response to external growth signals. Moreover, rGEF enhanced the dissociation of bound GDP from some of ras-like G proteins, R-ras, rap1-A, rab1-B, and rho proteins, raising the possibility that rGEF may affect the activities of these proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Although HLA genes have been shown to be associated with certain diseases, the basis for this association is unknown. Recent studies, however, have documented patterns of nucleotide sequence variation among some HLA genes associated with a particular disease. For rheumatoid arthritis, HLA genes in most patients have a shared nucleotide sequence encoding a key structural element of an HLA class II polypeptide; this sequence element is critical for the interaction of the HLA molecule with antigenic peptides and with responding T cells, suggestive of a direct role for this sequence element in disease susceptibility. We describe the serological and cellular immunologic characteristics encoded by this rheumatoid arthritis-associated sequence element. Site-directed mutagenesis of the DRB1 gene was used to define amino acids critical for antibody and T-cell recognition of this structural element, focusing on residues that distinguish the rheumatoid arthritis-associated alleles Dw4 and Dw14 from a closely related allele, Dw10, not associated with disease. Both the gain and loss of rheumatoid arthritis-associated epitopes were highly dependent on three residues within a discrete domain of the HLA-DR molecule. Recognition was most strongly influenced by the following amino acids (in order): 70 greater than 71 greater than 67. Some alloreactive T-cell clones were also influenced by amino acid variation in portions of the DR molecule lying outside the shared sequence element.\r"

  ".U": "91045940\r", 
  ".W": "The recognition of promoter region -10 nucleotide sequences in prokaryotes is believed to be mediated by a segment of alpha-helix in a region of RNA polymerase sigma factors called 2.4. Earlier genetic studies implicated Thr-100 in region 2.4 of the Bacillus subtilis sigma factor sigma H in the recognition of the G.C base pair at position -13 in the -10 region (GAAT) of a cognate promoter. In confirmation of this assignment, we now show that a change-of-specificity mutant of sigma H in which Thr-100 was replaced with isoleucine suppresses a G.C----A.T nucleotide substitution at position -13 but not other \"promoter down mutations\" (causing impaired promoter activity) at positions -13, -12, and -11. We also show that a loss-of-contact mutant created by the replacement of Thr-100 with alanine (having a short side chain) enables sigma H to tolerate three different promoter down mutations at position -13 but not down mutations at other positions. Finally, we suggest the identification of an additional amino acid involved in base-pair recognition by the demonstration that the replacement of Arg-96 with alanine specifically suppresses an A.T----G.C promoter down mutation at position -12. The identification of amino acids that are four residues apart that are involved in the recognition of adjacent base pairs may fix the orientation of region 2.4 (its NH2 terminus being proximal to the promoter transcription start site) and is consistent with a model in which the recognition of promoter region -10 nucleotide sequences is mediated by an alpha-helix in which residues involved in base-pair contact are separated by one turn and clustered on one face of the helix.\r"

Clones with binding activity to tetanus toxoid were identified by filter hybridization with radiolabeled antigen and appeared at a frequency of 0.2% in the library. These human antigen binding fragments, consisting of a heavy-chain fragment covalently linked to a light chain, displayed high affinity of binding to tetanus toxoid with equilibrium constants in the nanomolar range but did not cross-react with other proteins tested. We estimate that this human immunoexpression library contains 20,000 clones with high affinity and specificity to our chosen antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Although immunoglobulin light chains are usually secreted in association with heavy chains, free light chains can be secreted by lymphocytes. To identify the structural features of light chains that are essential for their secretion, we mutated a conserved sequence in the variable domain of a lambda I light chain. The effects of the mutations on secretion were assayed by transient expression in COS-1 cells. One mutant (AV60), which replaced Ala-60 with Val, was secreted as efficiently as wild-type lambda I by transfected COS-1 cells. This result was not surprising because secreted lambda II chains contain valine in this position. However, a second lambda I mutant (AV60FS62), which replaced Phe-62 with Ser as well as Ala-60 with Val, was not secreted. This mutant was arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum, as judged by immunofluorescence and by its association with a lumenal endoplasmic reticulum protein, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP). The defect in secretion was not due to gross misfolding of the lambda I chain, since cells cotransfected with AV60FS62 and an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene produced functional antigen-binding antibodies. These assembled IgM molecules were still not secreted. Hence, the replacement of Phe-62 with Ser specifically affects a determinant on the lambda I light chain that is necessary for the intracellular transport of this molecule.\r"

In about 60% of the cells tested, the neuropeptides at concentrations between 0.01 and 2.5 microM produced a dose-dependent reversible attenuation of Na+ currents. With 2 microM TRH-OH, peak Na+ current amplitude was reduced by 20-50% (27 +/- 8%, mean +/- SD; n = 16), whereas at the same concentration TRH was approximately half as effective as TRH-OH. In the presence of the tripeptides, the voltage-dependent parameter of the Na+ current were unaltered. TRH-induced reduction of Na+ current amplitude was transient and recovered almost completely during maintained exposure to the peptides. In addition, the response to either TRH-OH or TRH decreased with repeated treatment. Our results demonstrate that neuronal Na+ channels can be modulated by naturally occurring neuropeptides.\r"

The plasmid-borne opd gene of Pseudomonas diminuta strain MG specifies an organophosphorus acid hydrolase, a phosphotriesterase, that has been well characterized and can hydrolyze a broad spectrum of insect and mammalian neurotoxins. The in situ functioning of this enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates has been analyzed directly in insects by transferring the opd gene into embryos of Drosophila melanogaster by P element-mediated transformation. The chromosomal locations of this stably inherited transgenic locus differed from strain to strain and demonstrated various expressivity on the whole-insect basis. Transcriptional induction of opd in one of these strains under control of the Drosophila heat shock promoter, hsp70, resulted in the synthesis of stable active enzyme that accumulated to high levels with repeated induction. The heat shock-induced synthesis of organophosphorus acid hydrolases in transgenic flies conferred enhanced resistance to toxic paralysis by the organophosphate insecticide paraoxon.\r"

Isomorphous derivatives obtained by the synthesis of site-specific iodinated DNA oligomers were of critical importance in solving the structure. The crystal structure contains three independent Cro-operator complexes that have very similar, although not necessarily identical, conformations. In the complex, the protein dimer undergoes a large conformational change relative to the crystal structure of the free protein. One monomer rotates by about 40 degrees relative to the other, this being accomplished primarily by a twisting of the two beta-sheet strands that connect one monomer with the other. In the complex, the DNA is bent by about 40 degrees into the shape of a boomerang but maintains essentially Watson-Crick B-form. In contrast to other known protein-DNA complexes, the DNA is not stacked end-to-end. The structure confirms the general features of the model previously proposed for the interaction of Cro with DNA.\r"

  ".U": "91045967\r", 
  ".W": "Eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) is a 25-kDa polypeptide that binds to the 7-methylguanosine-containing cap of mRNA and participates in the transfer of mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit, a step that is rate-limiting for protein synthesis under most cellular conditions. eIF-4E is the least abundant of the initiation factors, is present at approximately 10% of molar concentration of mRNA, and thus may serve as a site of regulation for the recruitment of mRNA into polysomes. Previous studies have indicated that phosphorylation of eIF-4E at Ser-53 is correlated with an increased rate of protein synthesis in a variety of systems in vivo and is required for eIF-4E to become bound to the 48S initiation complex. In this study we show that overexpression of eIF-4E in HeLa cells using an episomally replicating, BK virus-based vector leads to an unusual phenotype: cells grow rapidly, forming densely packed, multilayered foci. They progressively form syncytia, some containing as many as six nuclei, and ultimately lyse 1 month after transfection. Some of these properties are reminiscent of oncogenically transformed cells. Cells transfected with the identical vector expressing a variant of eIF-4E, which contains alanine at position 53 and thus cannot be phosphorylated at the major in vivo site, grow normally. Estimations using the Ala-53 variant or a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in the same vector indicate that the degree of eIF-4E overexpression is 3- to 9-fold more than the endogenous level. These results suggest that eIF-4E may play a key role in cell cycle progression.\r"

EST 5 is expressed in the eyes and hemolymph of transformed D. melanogaster just as it is in D. pseudoobscura, but it is not detectable in the ejaculatory duct, where the homologous enzyme, EST 6, is most abundant. EST 5 also occurs at equal levels in both sexes of the transformants and D. pseudoobscura, whereas EST 6 is more abundant in male than in female D. melanogaster. Northern analysis of transformed and untransformed flies indicates that the expression patterns of EST 5 and EST 6 are controlled at the level of transcription and suggests that regulatory differences between Est-6 and Est-5 have evolved mainly through cis-acting regulatory changes in the two loci rather than through alterations in trans-acting factors. Equal expression of EST 5 in male and female transformants also indicates that the X-chromosome-linked Est-5 gene of D. pseudoobscura, when isolated as a 4.5-kilobase restriction fragment, is not dosage compensated after integration into an autosome of D. melanogaster.\r"

Inhibitor plasma from patient Bt was observed to have an isolated banding pattern, or spectrotype, at pI 8.4 (SP8.4) distinct from his remaining anti-factor VIII antibodies. SP8.4 antibodies from this patient were partially purified and used to prepare monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies. Monoclonal antibody Mab20-2H was found to detect a spectrotype in isoelectric-focused Bt plasma identical to SP8.4 and to bind anti-factor VIII antibodies. Furthermore, Mab20-2H binding could inhibit the binding of these anti-factor VIII antibodies to antigen, indicating that Mab20-2H recognizes an idiotope associated with antigen binding. Mab20-2H was also found to recognize antibodies from another inhibitor patient. This and other anti-idiotype reagents will be useful for defining genetic factors involved in the human immune response to factor VIII and in designing approaches to prevent or ameliorate this response.\r"

Among the protein molecules specifically located in presynaptic terminals, synapsin I and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) have been shown to modulate evoked transmitter release in the squid giant synapse. In the present study, analysis of synaptic noise in this chemical junction was used to determine whether these proteins also play a role in the control of spontaneous and enhanced spontaneous transmitter release. Injections of dephosphorylated synapsin I into the presynaptic terminal reduced the rate of spontaneous and enhanced quantal release, whereas injection of phosphorylated synapsin I did not modify such release. By contrast CaM kinase II injection increased enhanced miniature release without affecting spontaneous miniature frequency. These results support the view that dephosphorylated synapsin I \"cages\" synaptic vesicles while CaM kinase II, by phosphorylating synapsin I, \"decages\" these organelles and increases their availability for release without affecting the release mechanism itself.\r"

  ".U": "91045977\r", 
  ".W": "The scrapie and cellular isoforms of the prion protein (PrPSc and PrPC) differ strikingly in a number of their biochemical and metabolic properties. The structural features underlying these differences are unknown, but they are thought to result from a posttranslational process. Both PrP isoforms contain complex type oligosaccharides, raising the possibility that differences in the asparagine-linked glycosylation account for the properties that distinguish PrPC and PrPSc. ScN2a and ScHaB cells in culture produce several PrP molecules with relative molecular masses of 26-35 kDa and proteinase K-resistant cores of 19-29 kDa. When the cells were treated with tunicamycin, this heterogeneity was eliminated and a single PrP species of 26 kDa was observed. Several hours after its synthesis, a fraction of this protein became insoluble in detergents and acquired a proteinase K-resistant core, thus displaying two of the biochemical hallmarks of PrPSc. Synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin restricted the proteinase K-resistant cores of PrP to a single species of 19 kDa. No proteinase K-resistant PrP was found in uninfected cells. Expression of a mutated PrP gene lacking both asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in ScN2a cells resulted in the synthesis of 19-kDa proteinase K-resistant PrP molecules. We conclude that asparagine-linked glycosylation is not essential for the synthesis of proteinase K-resistant PrP and that structural differences unrelated to asparagine-linked oligosaccharides must exist between PrPC and PrPSc. Whether unglycosylated PrPSc molecules are associated with scrapie prion infectivity remains to be established.\r"

By use of the polymerase chain reaction to amplify genomic fragments with the attachment of a high-melting G + C-rich region (GC clamp) and analysis of these fragments by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, heterozygous mutations in the Gs alpha-subunit gene were found in two kindreds. These included a G----C substitution at the donor splice junction of intron 10 and a coding frameshift created by a single base deletion within exon 10. The findings illustrate the heterogeneity of genetic defects in Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and the usefulness of the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis method to search rapidly for mutations in a large candidate gene.\r"

  ".U": "91045986\r", 
  ".W": "Liver cancer is a major cause of premature death in many areas of Africa and Asia and its incidence is strongly correlated with exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). Because AFB1 requires metabolic activation to achieve a biological response, there is a need for detailed knowledge of the mechanism of activation to assess individual risk. We have carried out an extensive study using a total of 19 human liver samples to determine the individual variability in the metabolism of the toxin to mutagenic or detoxification products and to identify the specific cytochrome P-450 forms involved in these processes. Metabolism to the toxic 8,9-epoxide or to products mutagenic in the Ames test was found to exhibit very large individual variation. The rates of metabolic activation were highly correlated with both the level of proteins of the P450IIIA gene family and with the total cytochrome P-450 content of the microsomes. In agreement with this, antibodies reacting with P450IIIA proteins were strong inhibitors of both the metabolism and mutagenicity in the majority of the samples. However, the inhibition varied between 50% and 100%. The expression of a protein in the P450IIC gene family also correlated with AFB1 metabolism and mutagenicity. This result therefore indicated the involvement of cytochromes other than P450IIIA in the activation of AFB1 by human liver microsomes. This hypothesis was strongly supported by the finding that antibodies to P450IA2 and P450IIA1 were also effective inhibitors of metabolism in many of the samples. These data demonstrate that, although P450IIIA probably plays an important role in AFB1 activation, several other cytochrome P-450 forms have the capacity to activate the toxin. Similar considerations apply to detoxifying metabolism to aflatoxin Q1 and aflatoxin M1. The levels of expression of many of the forms of cytochrome P-450 involved in AFB1 metabolism are known to be highly sensitive to environmental factors. This indicates that such factors will be an important determinant in individual susceptibility to the tumorigenic action of AFB1.\r"

Three TnphoA insertions tagged cell motility genes, called cgl, which control the adventurous movement of cells. The products of the tagged cgl genes could function in trans upon other cells and were localized primarily in the cell envelope and extracellular space, consistent with TnphoA tagging genes for extracellular factors controlling motility.\r"

No transcripts corresponding to the listeriolysin gene were detected in the mutant. DNA sequencing of this region from the hemolytic strain EGD revealed that the region deleted in the mutant would abrogate expression of a 27-kDa polypeptide. Introduction of a recombinant plasmid expressing this 27-kDa polypeptide restored hemolytic activity to the mutant and increased the hemolytic activity of the wild-type L. monocytogenes strain EGD. We have designated the gene encoding the 27-kDa polypeptide prfA, for positive regulatory factor of listeriolysin (lisA) expression.

When cells were shifted from maximum expression of the subtilisin transcript in stationary phase to physiological conditions, which allowed for the resumption of vegetative growth, the cellular concentration of the subtilisin mRNA decreased rapidly.

To protect their eggs from encapsulation by Drosophila melanogaster blood cells, Leptopilina heterotoma females inject a factor that selectively destroys lamellocytes, the type of Drosophila blood cell involved in recognition and encapsulation of large foreign objects. Other types of host blood cells, including the phagocytic plasmatocytes, remain functional. This report demonstrates that the destructive factor for lamellocytes is a virus-like particle (VLP) stored in the reservoir of an accessory gland associated with the female wasp reproductive system. We show that VLPs enter Drosophila blood cells in vitro. VLPs are found free in the cytoplasm of lamellocytes but are confined to phagocytic vesicles of plasmatocytes. As lamellocytes are susceptible to the VLP infection and plasmatocytes are not, we conclude that the mode of VLP entry and its disposition in the cytoplasm determine the fate of the infected host blood cell.\r"

In this model the decay of the primary Fe-O2 intermediate in the fully reduced enzyme is a consequence of direct electron transfer from cytochrome a. To test the model we measured the time dependence of the oxidation of cytochrome a by monitoring the resonance Raman scattering intensity of its vibrational modes. A rapid oxidation of cytochrome a was detected that quantitatively agrees with the model. These results indicate that the mechanism of oxygen reduction and proposed frameworks for proton translocation must be reexamined.\r"

Structural analysis of the predicted sequence identifies two putative functional domains of the protein: (i) an N-terminal cysteine-rich region that is similar to epidermal growth factor-like domains of Drosophila Notch-1 protein and (ii) a large segment of the sequence that exhibited 54.5% identity with C-terminal domains of human coagulation factors VIII and V. These similarities in structure are used to predict the possible functions of the protein and its means of interaction with the cell surface. mRNA expression was detectable in mammary tissue from nonpregnant animals but was maximal in the lactating gland. In cultured cells, mRNA levels also correlated with the degree of cellular differentiation.\r"

In addition, tau has been shown to be an integral component of paired helical filaments, the principal constituent of the neurofibrillary tangles found in brains of patients with Alzheimer disease and of most aged individuals with Down syndrome (trisomy 21). We report here the localization of the well-characterized Tau-1 monoclonal antibody to the nucleolar organizer regions of the acrocentric chromosomes and to their interphase counterpart, the fibrillar component of the nucleolus, in human neuroblastoma cells. Similar localization to the nucleolar organizer regions was also observed in other human cell lines and in one monkey kidney cell line but was not seen in non-primate species. Immunochemically, we further demonstrate the existence of the entire tau molecule in the isolated nuclei of neuroblastoma cells. Nuclear tau proteins, like the tau proteins of the paired helical filaments, cannot be extracted in standard SDS-containing electrophoresis sample buffer but require pretreatment with formic acid prior to immunoblot analysis. This work indicates that tau may function in processes not directly associated with microtubules and that highly insoluble complexes of tau may also play a role in normal cellular physiology.\r"

The observed reporter gene expression pattern closely parallels endogenous Hox-3.1 expression in 8- to 9.5-day postcoitum (p.c.) embryos. At 10.5 days p.c. and later, the pattern of beta-galactosidase activity diverges from the Hox-3.1 pattern, and an inappropriately high level of reporter gene expression is observed in posterior spinal ganglia. Inclusion of an additional 2 kb of upstream sequences is sufficient to suppress this aberrant expression in the developing spinal ganglia. Together, these results show that the control of early Hox-3.1 expression is complex, involving at least one positively acting and one negatively acting element.\r"

On the basis of inverse half-saturations of the enzymes, the order of acceptor substrate affinity for factor XIIIa was pEAQQIV much greater than Boc-AQQIV greater than Boc-QQIV, and for transglutaminase, Boc-QQIV greater than Boc-AQQIV greater than pEAQQIV (amino acid residues are shown in one-letter code; pE, pyroglutamic acid; Boc, tert-butyloxycarbonyl). Sequence analysis of dansylcadaverine-substituted pEAQQIV indicated that the first of the two adjacent glutamine residues was the target of enzymatic modification. Boc-QIV showed no substrate activity with either enzyme. Crosslinking of crystallins in Ca2(+)-treated rabbit lens homogenate was readily inhibited by Boc-QQIV, Boc-AQQIV, and pEAQQIV, as was the formation of alpha-chain polymers in human fibrin by pEAQQIV in the presence of human factor XIIIa.

We have isolated and sequenced a 2.3-kilobase cDNA clone coding for the entire sequence of human IDS. Analysis of the deduced 550-amino acid IDS precursor sequence indicates that IDS has a 25-amino acid amino-terminal signal sequence, followed by 8 amino acids that are removed from the proprotein. An internal proteolytic cleavage occurs to produce the mature IDS present in human liver shown to contain a 42-kDa polypeptide N-terminal to a 14-kDa polypeptide. The IDS sequence has strong sequence homology with other sulfatases (such as sea urchin arylsulfatase, human arylsulfatases A, B, and C, and human glucosamine 6-sulfatase), suggesting that the sulfatases comprise an evolutionarily related family of genes that arose by gene duplication and divergent evolution. The arylsulfatases have a greater homology with each other than with the non-arylsulfatases (IDS and glucosamine 6-sulfatase). The IDS cDNA detected RNA species of 5.7, 5.4, 2.1, and 1.4 kilobases in human placental RNA and revealed structural alterations and gross deletions of the IDS gene in many of the clinically severe Hunter syndrome patients studied.\r"

  ".W": "(+/-)-7 beta,8 alpha-Dihydroxy-9 alpha,10 alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10- tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPDE) is a direct-acting carcinogen that forms DNA adducts only with purines, predominantly (greater than 95%) with guanine. To investigate the effect of nucleotide excision repair on the kinds and locations (spectra) of mutations induced in diploid human fibroblasts by BPDE, we synchronized cells and exposed them to BPDE either at the beginning of S phase just when the target gene hypoxanthine (guanine) phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) is replicated or 12 hr prior to the beginning of S phase (early G1 phase). Clones resistant to 6-thioguanine were isolated, and the mRNA in lysates of 100-500 cells from each mutant clone was used to synthesize cDNA. HPRT cDNA was amplified 10(11)-fold by the polymerase chain reaction and then sequenced directly. The mutants derived from the two populations did not differ in the kinds of mutations; 19/20 of the base substitutions in cells taken from S phase and 19/19 of those from G1 phase involved G.C base pairs, predominantly G.C----T.A. However, they differed significantly in the distribution of the mutations in the coding region of the gene. In the cells from G1 phase, 29% of the mutations were clustered within a unique run of six guanine bases; in the S-phase cells, only 4% were located there. Assuming that the premutagenic BPDE-induced lesions involved purines, in the cells treated at the beginning of S phase, 24% of these lesions were located in the transcribed strand, whereas in the G1-treated cells, none were. This suggests that in the HPRT gene of diploid human cells excision repair of BPDE adducts occurs preferentially on the transcribed strand.\r"

A nonnatural immunophilin ligand, 506BD, which contains only the common structural elements of FK506 and rapamycin, was synthesized and found to be a high-affinity ligand of FKBP and a potent inhibitor of FKBP rotamase activity. Whereas 506BD does not interfere with T cell activation, it does block the immunosuppressive effects of both FK506 and rapamycin. Thus, the common immunophilin binding element of these immunosuppressants, which is responsible for rotamase inhibition, is fused to different effector elements, resulting in the inhibition of different signaling pathways. Inhibition of rotamase activity is an insufficient requirement for mediating these effects.\r"

The model was tested by the internal application of a synthetic peptide, with the sequence of the first 20 residues of the ShB alternatively spliced variant, to noninactivating mutant channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The peptide restored inactivation in a concentration-dependent manner. Like normal inactivation, peptide-induced inactivation was not noticeably voltage-dependent. Trypsin-treated peptide and peptides with sequences derived from the first 20 residues of noninactivating mutants did not restore inactivation. These results support the proposal that inactivation occurs by a cytoplasmic domain that occludes the ion-conducting pore of the channel.\r"

Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was measured in 72 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from 28 patients with intraventricular drains and in nine samples from outpatient controls undergoing diagnostic lumbar puncture. Levels were correlated with diagnosis; systemic fluid administration; concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma; intracranial pressure; sodium, glucose, and protein concentrations, osmolality, and cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid; sodium concentration in the serum; and hemodynamics. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was highest in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with intracerebral hematoma, followed by those with obstructive hydrocephalus and subarachnoid hemorrhage (19 +/- 2, 13 +/- 3, and 8 +/- 2 pg/ml, respectively); atrial natriuretic factor concentration was less than 4 pg/ml in the controls. Patients treated with fluid restriction had significantly higher atrial natriuretic factor levels than those receiving maintenance or high-volume fluids (16 +/- 3, 8 +/- 2, 10 +/- 1 pg/ml, respectively). The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma was significantly elevated in patients with intracerebral hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage (155 +/- 38 and 92 +/- 20 pg/ml, respectively) and did not correlate with fluid administration or the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid. Neither cerebrospinal fluid nor plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor correlated with intracranial pressure; cerebrospinal fluid sodium, glucose, or protein concentrations, osmolality, or cell count; serum sodium concentration; or hemodynamics. We conclude that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is a nonspecific indicator of brain injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty minutes after embolization the rabbits were blindly treated with tissue plasminogen activator (n = 21), urokinase (n = 20), or 0.9% saline (n = 20). At 6 hours the rabbits were sacrificed, and the cerebral vasculature was inspected for the location and number of emboli. The brain was then cut into 0.5-cm-thick coronal sections and stained with triphenyltetrazolium chloride to define areas of infarction. Treatment with either tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase significantly reduced the number of emboli present in the cerebral circulation (p less than 0.05). The area of ischemic injury was also significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) by acute fibrinolytic therapy with either tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase. However, only treatment with tissue plasminogen activator significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) the incidence of infarction. There was no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage in any rabbit. Early fibrinolytic therapy improved outcome in this model of acute embolic stroke.\r"

Striking increases in c-fos RNA were observed in dentate granule cells within 15 minutes of recirculation and remained evident through 1 hour, returning to undetectable control levels by 3 hours. Modest c-fos hybridization was seen in CA1 and CA3 neurons during the same time course. These results are consistent with the rapid and transient stimulation-induced c-fos expression observed in many experimental systems. Hsp70 expression showed a longer time course, being strongly induced in all major hippocampal neuron populations within 3 hours and persisting for approximately 12 hours in dentate granule cells and through 24 hours in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Notably, the most prolonged expression of hsp70 RNA was observed in vulnerable CA1 neurons that minimally accumulate the immunoreactive protein, with hybridization detected essentially until the death of this cell population at 3-4 days. These studies demonstrate an overlapping distribution of hsp70 and c-fos expression in gerbil hippocampus after ischemia, although there are differences in time course and in the relative induction observed in different neuron populations. The transient increase in c-fos hybridization in dentate granule cells is identical to that seen in various seizure paradigms and provides further support for activation of hippocampal circuitry after ischemia. The prolonged time course of hsp70 messenger RNA expression in vulnerable CA1 neurons may provide a molecular correlate of proposed excitotoxic mechanisms mediating delayed neuronal death.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the proposal that preischemic hyperglycemia causes exaggerated brain damage by decreasing intracellular or extracellular pH to below a specified threshold value. We also provide a critical appraisal of two related hypotheses. The first is that hyperglycemia enhances brain damage by causing excessive intraglial acidosis; the second, that the critical degree of acidosis is reached not during the ischemia but when recirculation is instituted. The following conclusions are drawn. First, the evidence is inconclusive in favor of marked compartmentation of H+ during ischemia, based on a discontinuous delta lactate/delta PCO2 relation and on direct intracellular pH measurements. In fact, results obtained with identical techniques in normoglycemic animals suggest that the acid compartment assumed to be glia is very small and may be of another origin. Second, although recirculation may give rise to a further increase in either extracellular or intracellular acidosis under certain conditions, this acidosis is not a prerequisite for increased tissue damage or infarction. Third, a critical appraisal of reports supports the contention that enhanced damage is triggered below a specified threshold pH value. In complete or near-complete ischemia, this value corresponds to a tissue lactate content of 17-20 mM.kg-1 wet wt. No correlation exists between subthreshold values for delta lactate and the severity of tissue damage. Furthermore, hyperglycemia cannot be expected to enhance damage if conditions prevent lactate from reaching threshold values or if they uncouple changes in lactate and pH.\r"

An individual donated a unit of whole blood on two occasions; 1 unit was held for 6 hours before processing and the other for 8 hours. Autologous RBC 24-hour survival levels after 42 days of storage were comparable. Laboratory A, using a 99mTc-51Cr technique, found mean survival levels of 79 percent (6-hour hold) and 78 percent (8-hour hold) (n = 8). Analysis by the single-label procedure found the mean levels to be 82 and 81 percent. Laboratory B, using an albumin 125I-51Cr technique, found mean survival levels of 74 and 72 percent (n = 10). Mean hemolysis and ATP levels were found to be comparable after 42 days of storage following 6- and 8-hour holding periods. 2,3 DPG levels were reduced to a greater degree during the longer hold. The factor VIII levels in plasma frozen for at least a month after 6- and 8-hour holding periods were comparable; thawed plasma contained mean levels of 0.77 and 0.76 units per mL (n = 21). These studies indicate that components prepared by using a CPD-ADSOL system after holding periods of 6 and 8 hours have comparable properties.\r"

Pearson correlation showed a positive relationship between cost per patient and physician volume for nonemergency patients (-0.129, p less than 0.0001) and emergency patients (-0.368, p less than 0.0001). This may have been explained (in part) by a greater severity of illness for patients of low-volume urologists. These findings suggest, however, that the volume of urologic procedures per urologist may be related to hospital resource consumption. The health care financing environment of the future should provide substantial interest in this finding for those involved in the consumption of urologic services.\r"

  ".W": "Previously we have reported that ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles migrate across capillary endothelium, a prerequisite for the design of particulate pharmaceuticals for MR receptor imaging. In the current study, USPIO particles are directed specifically to asialoglycoprotein (ASG) receptors by coupling galactose terminals in the form of arabinogalactan (AG) to these particles. Biodistribution data showed that ASG-directed, AG-coated USPIO (AG-USPIO) particles selectively accumulate in the liver but not in other organs. Electron microscopy of liver showed electron-dense iron oxide particles bound to hepatocyte cell-surface membranes and in large numbers within intracellular lysosomes. The specificity of AG-USPIO for asialoglycoprotein receptors was confirmed by incubation experiments with and without ASG-blocking agents such as D(+)galactose and asialofetuin. In vivo MR imaging in rats showed a significant decrease in liver signal intensity at low doses (2 mumol Fe/kg); no significant changes were observed in the spleen. This decrease in signal intensity is larger than that observed with conventional iron oxides at equal doses. These initial data suggest that, for the first time, superparamagnetic agents can be directed to specific sites for MR imaging by strategies such as receptor targeting.\r"

Pennal and Tile were the first authors to attempt to classify pelvic fractures according to the force vector causing them. This concept was refined by Young and Burgess, who provided a more detailed classification system, again relating to force vectors. This article focuses on this classification and its significance with regard to pelvic stability, type of pelvic disruption, and hence the type of corrective forces that should be applied in the surgical management. Use of a classification system of pelvic fractures based on force vectors allows the orthopedic surgeon to apply external fixation in the most appropriate manner to correct pelvic deformity and to maximize patients' survival.\r"

Gradient-recalled echo, spin-echo, or cine MR techniques were used. In 26 of the 31 patients, venous obstruction was confirmed by CT, venography, sonography, surgery, or autopsy. Causes included tumor invasion, compression of veins, coagulopathy, or indwelling catheters. MR detected an abnormality of the superior vena cava in all 16 cases in which it was seen on other tests. Abnormality of the internal or external jugular veins was detected in all six cases in which other studies were abnormal. Abnormality of veins in the shoulder region was detected by MR in 10 of 12 patients in whom such disease was seen on other tests. The two interpretive errors were caused by nonocclusive clot, short (less than 2-cm) occlusions, and metallic artifact. Overall, MR correctly identified abnormality in 32 of 34 vessels (sensitivity, 94%). In all cases, a negative MR study was found to be a true negative (no false positives in 42 normal vessels; specificity, 100%). We conclude that MR is an accurate means of assessing patency of the thoracic inlet and mediastinal veins. Its noninvasive nature and multiplanar capability contribute to its usefulness in this clinical setting.\r"

Image contrast and radiation dose were measured for two tissue-equivalent breast phantoms. We also compared sequential pairs of mammograms, one processed at 90 sec and one at 3 min, from 44 patients on the basis of nine categories of image quality. Increased processing time reduced breast radiation dose by 30%, increased contrast by 11%, and produced slight overall gains in image quality. Simple modifications can convert a 90-sec processor to a 3-min unit. We recommend that implementation of extended processing be considered, especially by those centers that obtain a large number of screening mammograms. Three-minute film processing can reduce breast radiation dose by 30% and increase contrast by 11% without compromising image quality.\r"

Two hundred fifty-seven stones from 50 patients were treated with the EDAP LT.O1 lithotriptor until all fragments measured 2 mm or less in diameter. The fragmentation process was observed, and two patterns were evident: central fragmentation and peripheral chipping. The majority of stones fragmented centrally. Fragmentation characteristics in different stones from the same patient were compared with those from different patients. Stone diameter, shock-wave frequency and power, and CT appearance were examined and correlated with fragmentation. Gallstones from the same patient showed uniform fragmentation patterns and consistent relationships between fragmentation time and gallstone size, shock-wave frequency, and power. In stones from the same patient, gallstone size had a marked effect on fragmentation time, which correlated with the cube of the stone diameter, and shock-wave frequency and power had a proportional inverse linear relationship with fragmentation time. When controlling for stone size and treatment parameters, stones from multiple patients showed marked differences in fragmentation time, and because of this, poor correlation between stone size and fragmentation time. Stones grouped according to CT pattern and attenuation showed wide variation and no correlation between CT characteristics and fragmentation pattern or fragmentation time. Our results show that a great variability exists in fragmentation time of gallstones, making it impossible to accurately predict fragmentation time at a given stone size. Only rough estimates of longer fragmentation times with increasing stone size can be made. The linear relationships between shock-wave frequency or power and fragmentation time allow one to easily predict the effect of manipulating these variables and to tailor treatment to each patient's tolerance. Finally, CT appearance does not appear to be predictive of fragmentation outcome.\r"

This method is simpler to perform than traditional aspiration biopsy and yields concentrated cell smears that are easier to interpret. The sample enters the needle because of capillary action, a physical property of fluid that causes it to flow into the lumen of a narrow channel. This nonaspiration technique was used in 40 consecutive patients undergoing fine-needle biopsy of mass lesions of the liver. A 22-gauge spinal needle was used in all procedures. The cytology smears obtained were prepared, stained, and interpreted by the same methods used for conventional fine-needle cytology specimens. Specific diagnoses were rendered in 36 patients (90%) and in 32 (94%) of those patients with malignant tumors. An average of 1.7 needle passes (range, 1-4) was needed per patient. We conclude that the results from nonaspiration fine-needle cytology of the liver are as good as those from conventional aspiration technique, and the nonaspiration technique is easier to perform and results in smears that are easier to interpret.\r"

We report here our 4-year experience, in which ethanol injection was performed 419 times on 108 lesions in 77 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Histopathologic examination performed in 14 cases after the therapy revealed that the lesion was completely necrotic in 10 cases, 90% necrotic in three cases, and 70% necrotic in the remaining case. Angiography performed after the therapy showed complete disappearance of tumor stain in 37 of 42 cases treated with ethanol injection. CT after the therapy showed no enhancement of the treated lesion in 55 of 56 cases. Elevated serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein decreased in 21 of 24 cases. Ethanol injection improved the long-term prognosis of the patients. Among the 50 patients in whom there were three or fewer lesions and all lesions were treated by ethanol injection, the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year survival rates were 89%, 74%, 68%, and 60%, respectively. Factors that significantly affected the prognosis were the goal of the treatment, liver function, and size of the largest lesion. Serious complications rarely occurred even in patients with severe liver dysfunction. Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy appears to be valuable for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Small low-intensity nodules were seen on gradient-echo images with short TEs (10-13 msec) in 13 of the 26 patients. In 12 of these 13 patients, small low-intensity nodules appeared larger and clearer as the TE was prolonged (14-25 msec). On T2-weighted spin-echo images, small low-intensity nodules were seen in 12 of the 13 patients, but not seen as well as on gradient-echo images. Pathologic correlation in these 13 patients revealed that the nodules on the MR images corresponded to iron deposits in regenerating nodules. Small low-intensity nodules were observed only on T2-weighted spin-echo images in two of the remaining 13 patients, in whom microscopic examination of the liver revealed marked inflammatory cell infiltration in the fibrous septa and no iron deposition. We conclude that small low-intensity nodules observed on MR images are caused by iron deposits in regenerating nodules, and that gradient-echo images with short and prolonged TEs are useful to confirm the presence of iron deposits in regenerating nodules.\r"

In order to study this problem, the appearance of ascites (20 patients) and pleural effusions (five patients) was assessed on MR images made during suspended respiration with flow-compensated gradient-echo sequences as well as T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Signal intensities of vessels, fluid collections, and muscle were measured and vessel/muscle and vessel/fluid contrast were calculated. Fluid motion was measured with a bolus tracking technique that tags a selected volume of fluid with an RF presaturation. Fluid collections had a bright signal in four of five patients with pleural effusion and in 15 of 20 patients with ascites. The average contrast ratio between bright components of the fluid collections and vessels was only 0.03 +/- 0.09. Bright fluid collections were seen on MR angiograms and could obscure blood vessels. Bolus tracking measurements of ascites revealed multidirectional flow, suggesting that its bright signal is related to motion that continues during suspended respiration. Fluid collections appeared dark on T1-weighted images in all patients, indicating that a short T1 relaxation time was not a cause of the high signal intensity. The results indicate that, despite breath-holding, ascites and pleural effusions can show bright signal intensity on gradient-echo images. Awareness of this phenomenon will avoid confusion between moving fluid collections and flowing blood and identify a source of image degradation on both gradient-echo and T2-weighted spin-echo MR acquisitions.\r"

Recently, however, the availability of high-frequency transducers has made consideration of internal structure possible. An important objective is to determine whether node enlargement is due to inflammatory or neoplastic processes. To determine the accuracy of sonography for this purpose, we obtained in vitro sonograms of 53 enlarged lymph nodes excised from 41 patients during surgery for neoplastic or nonneoplastic disease. The sonograms were obtained with 7.5- and 10-MHz transducers. They were interpreted by a radiologist who was unaware of the clinical diagnosis. The nodes were subsequently processed for anatomohistologic study; findings were compared side by side. In 26 of the 53 nodes, sonograms showed an identifiable central echogenic line, which on histologic specimen corresponded to the internal part of the medulla where the lymphatic sinuses converge. All these nodes were benign. Two other nodes had an echogenic internal structure not resembling the normal hilum; in one case this was caused by metastatic disease and in the other by fibrosis. Sonograms of the remaining 25 nodes showed no detectable hilar structure; 21 were involved by a tumor and four had diffuse fatty replacement. Our results suggest that the sonographic finding of a central echogenic line is a valid criterion of benignity. Absence of this finding may be due to factors other than neoplastic disease, such as fatty replacement.\r"

In order to ascertain characteristic CT features of extraadrenal retroperitoneal paragangliomas to differentiate them from other retroperitoneal tumors, 31 discrete tumors and two cases of paragangliomatosis in 28 patients were reviewed retrospectively, and the CT features were correlated with clinical and pathologic findings. There were 16 men and 12 women. Average age was 37 years (range, 11-70 years). Twenty-four patients (86%) had hypertension. Of these, catecholamine levels were elevated in all 18 patients who had biochemical studies. Four patients (14%) had malignant paragangliomas. The discrete tumors were classified by location as suprarenal (26%), renal hilar (32%), or infrarenal (42%). Suprarenal paragangliomas could not be distinguished from the ipsilateral adrenal gland on CT. The average size of functional tumors was smaller (7.0 cm) than that of nonfunctional tumors (12.0 cm), but the sizes of the two groups overlapped. Smaller tumors were more likely to be homogeneous and have well-defined margins than were larger tumors. Our findings indicate that extraadrenal retroperitoneal paragangliomas are functionally active more often than previously reported and that they are readily detected by CT as soft-tissue masses closely associated with the entire length of the abdominal aorta. However, no CT feature was found that was unique for paraganglioma.\r"

Surgical proof was available for all masses except hematomas, for which clinical follow-up confirmed the diagnosis. MR images were interpreted twice by three radiologists. The first review was accomplished without any clinical history and the second review with clinical history. Reviewers were asked to classify the lesion as benign or malignant on the basis of their clinical knowledge and analysis of MR image features (size, lesion margin, signal homogeneity, and neurovascular or bone involvement). Although interpretation varied somewhat because of the experience of the reviewers, the specificity and accuracy of diagnosis averaged 90% for both benign and malignant lesions. Negative predictive value for malignancy averaged 94% among the three reviewers. MR imaging is the technique of choice for identification and characterization of soft-tissue masses. The nature of the lesion (benign vs malignant) can be determined in the majority of cases.\r"

However, scant MR literature has been written about the postoperative MR appearance. We studied the MR appearance of lesions treated by curettage followed by packing with cancellous bone-chip allograft. We retrospectively reviewed the MR scans of 18 consecutive patients treated in this way. Pathologic diagnoses of these lesions were confirmed according to commonly accepted criteria. The allograft sites showed a distinctive pattern of speckled bright signal on T1-weighted images in eight cases. Thirteen of 18 grafts showed a whorled or speckled pattern of increased signal on the T2-weighted images. Only four allograft regions had predominantly low signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Two of 18 patients had recurrent tumor proved by open biopsy. MR images in these cases showed areas of homogeneous signal that replaced areas of speckled hyperintensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. In both these recurrences the tumor had signal intensity similar to that seen on the preoperative MR study. We conclude that knowledge of the MR appearance of cancellous bone chip allografts is important to avoid misinterpreting areas of high signal on T1- or T2-weighted images as areas of recurrence of tumor and/or hemorrhage.\r"

Twelve patients were studied within 6 months of the fracture. MR imaging changed the Salter-Harris classification in six. Interruption of the growth plate detected on T2-weighted images was associated with subsequent growth anomaly in six of eight patients. Horizontal fracture of the physis without interruption was associated with growth disturbance in only one of four patients. Sixteen growth plates were studied beyond 6 months after injury. Twelve had physeal bars and abnormal growth. Of four patients without physeal abnormality on MR imaging, two had normal growth and two had mild deformity. Our results show that MR imaging defects abnormalities in the cartilage that are associated with subsequent growth disturbances and provides accurate mapping of physeal bridging and associated growth abnormalities that have already occurred.\r"

Radiologic observations were based on skeletal plain films (13), contrast-enhanced examinations of the genitourinary system (12), abdominopelvic sonograms (nine), gastrointestinal studies (seven), CT scans of the pelvis and CNS (seven), MR images of the pelvis and CNS (six), renal nuclear medicine scans (three), myelography (three), and three-dimensional scans of the pelvis (two). Genitourinary and gastrointestinal abnormalities identified in our 13 patients included bladder malformations (13), hindgut anomalies (13), undescended testes (five), malrotation (five), duplicated mullerian structures (four), and renal ectopia (four). Skeletal abnormalities included symphysis pubis diastasis (13), posterior element dysraphism (12), vertebral segmentation anomalies (12), clubfeet (six), and hip dislocations (five). CNS anomalies included meningocele (nine) and Chiari malformation (one). Immediate surgical closure of the defect with maximal bowel preservation and diverting colostomy offers optimal chances for survival. Appropriate preoperative gastrointestinal and genitourinary evaluation is essential.\r"

All five patients (age range, 13-72 days) presented with jaundice and acholic stools. In all four patients who underwent sonographic examination, a cystic structure separate from the gallbladder representing the choledochal cyst was shown. The diagnosis of atresia of the distal common bile duct was made preoperatively in all cases by hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and was demonstrated by intraoperative cholangiography in four cases. All patients were successfully treated with surgical intervention within 1 month from the time of diagnosis. Early detection of this rare disorder, which may be distinct from choledochal cyst found in children and adults, is important to prevent fatal complications of biliary obstruction. The combined use of sonography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy can correctly identify this subset of patients with persistent neonatal jaundice and provide valuable information for prompt surgical management.\r"

Twenty localization procedures were performed in 19 patients (12 children and seven adults) with 21 foreign bodies including wood, glass, stone, metal, and lead pencil. Localization was accomplished by using anatomic landmarks, ink marks on the skin, and needle and hemostat markers. Localization was facilitated by the use of small standoff pads that were cut for use on small surfaces. The foreign bodies were visualized as hyperechoic foci with acoustic shadows that were partial or complete depending on the angle of insonation and foreign body composition. Hyperechoic comet-tail artifacts (reverberation artifacts) were seen with six metallic foreign bodies and one glass fragment. Nine foreign bodies were surrounded by hypoechoic halos caused by edema, abscess, or granulation tissue. A slow meticulous scanning technique and high-frequency transducer helped in detection of small foreign bodies. Sonographically guided removal of the foreign body was successful in all four patients in whom it was attempted. Scanning with the ultrasound beam parallel to the long axis of the hemostat and the foreign body was the fastest way to guide the hemostat to the tip of a foreign body. The procedure was accomplished most easily and quickly when one physician performed sonography and hemostat removal of the foreign body simultaneously. Our experience with these cases indicates that sonography is a useful tool in the localization and removal of soft-tissue foreign bodies.\r"

MR images of 21 patients with an abnormal clivus (19 with tumor invasion and two with marrow reconversion) were also evaluated retrospectively and compared with those of the control group to assess MR features distinguishing the two groups. Our study revealed that a normal adult clivus consisted of low- and high-intensity portions mixed in various proportions on T1-weighted images. The low-intensity portion was isointense or hyperintense relative to the pons and always contained foci of bright signal intensity. The low-intensity tumor of a pathologic clivus tended to be hypointense relative to the pons (17/19), and was completely devoid of foci of bright signal intensity. The normal adult clivus was approximately isointense relative to the pons on T2-weighted images. Clival tumors were grossly hyperintense relative to the pons on T2-weighted images in 11 of 17 patients. In the remaining six patients, either a portion of or the entire lesion was isointense relative to the pons and, therefore, was not detectable on T2-weighted images. A normal adult clivus can enhance to some degree (19/83). Clival tumors were found to enhance intensely. A clivus of very low signal intensity (signal void) on T1- or T2-weighted images was always abnormal. The clivus with marrow reconversion was uniformly hypointense relative to the pons on T1-weighted images and isointense relative to normal marrow on T2-weighted images. The intensity patterns of the normal clivus on T1- and T2-weighted MR images change predictably with advancing age. Intensity patterns of abnormal clivi differ from those of normal clivi. When contrast material is used, normal and abnormal clivi generally show different patterns of enhancement.\r"

In all 17 patients, meningeal disease was detected on the gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced T1-weighted images; the disease was detected on unenhanced images in three patients. Well-defined leptomeningeal patterns of enhancement were present in 15 patients. Other areas of involvement were the dura; brain parenchyma including hypothalamus, periventricular white matter, and ventricular ependyma; optic chiasm; and pituitary gland. Gadopentetate dimeglumine optimally evaluates meningeal disease and highlights the importance of the leptomeninges and Virchow-Robin spaces in the pathogenesis of CNS sarcoidosis. Enhanced MR is the preferred imaging technique for the evaluation of CNS sarcoidosis.\r"

Findings consisted primarily of four different patterns of signal abnormalities in the distribution of the anterior spinal artery. These abnormalities were identified as types A-D, depending on the degree of involvement of the gray matter and surrounding white matter. We found good correlation between the distribution of the signal abnormalities in the cord, the severity of the neurologic deficits, and the clinical outcome. MR is the imaging method of choice for diagnosing spinal cord ischemia or infarction. A thorough knowledge of the spinal cord arterial territories is crucial for characterizing ischemic MR signal abnormalities and for differentiating them from other causes of myelopathy.\r"

MR follow-up studies in five patients affected by Wernicke encephalopathy were performed with the aim of establishing the sensitivity of MR in depicting the typical diencephalic/mesencephalic lesions. All subjects had MR imaging in the acute phase of the disease and were reexamined 6-12 months later, at which time they were in good health. Three of them also had CT scanning. On MR, hyperintense areas seen surrounding the third ventricle and aqueduct during the acute phase of the disease had disappeared or diminished on follow-up evaluations. The third ventricle and aqueduct were dilated. We suggest that these findings reflect the natural evolution of Wernicke encephalopathy. The MR findings in Wernicke encephalopathy enable early diagnosis of the disease, which has a positive effect on both treatment and prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "The utility of post-thrombolysis, rest-redistribution thallium (TI)-201 scintigraphy was studied in 32 patients with a first myocardial infarction who were clinically stable following reperfusion. Day 1 scintigraphy obtained 5 +/- 4 hours (range 1 to 16) after thrombolysis revealed an average perfusion defect of 6.5 +/- 2.6 segments (range 1 to 11). There was a total of 208 abnormal segments, 137 of which were nonreversible at 4 hours, 50 of which were fully or partially reversible, and 21 of which had a reverse redistribution pattern. Repeat TI-201 scintigraphy on day 10 revealed significantly smaller perfusion defects of 4.9 +/- 2.4 segments (range 0 to 9) with improvement predominantly of the day 1 reversible segments, and the improvement in segmental perfusion correlated with better regional left ventricular function. Twenty-nine (58%) of the 50 reversible segments normalized by day 10, and 11 (22%) improved, whereas only 16 (12%) of 137 nonreversible segments had normalized by day 10, only 9 had (6%) improved and 112 (82%) were unchanged (p less than 0.001 reversible versus nonreversible). There was no significant change in segments with a pattern of reverse redistribution. The improvement of reversible segments was greater in the 16 patients who underwent coronary angioplasty (PTCA) during the interval between the two scintigrams than in the 16 who did not. All 24 reversible segments in the PTCA group improved or normalized by day 10 compared with 16 (62%) of 26 reversible segments in the No PTCA group (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, 8 of the 10 reversible segments in the No PTCA group that did not improve actually deteriorated and became nonreversible by day 10. The minor improvement of nonreversible segments was not related to PTCA. Consistent with the findings in individual segments, the 19 patients with a reversible component on the day 1 TI-201 scintigram had significantly greater improvement in perfusion defect by day 10 than the 13 patients without a reversible component (37 +/- 33% versus 7 +/- 22% decrease in perfusion defect severity, p less than 0.05), and this improvement was greatest in the 10 patients with a reversible component who underwent PTCA. In contrast, PTCA had no impact on the perfusion defect in the 13 patients without a reversible component. Our data suggest that following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, viable myocardium in the reperfused zone may remain ischemic, as manifested by a reversible pattern of TI-201 redistribution at rest, and thus may be in jeopardy of gradual progression to necrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Compared with the placebo, ANF induced an increase in urine volume (p less than 0.05), sodium excretion (p less than 0.05), and chloride excretion (p less than 0.05). Urinary potassium and creatinine clearance were unchanged. The maximal response of urinary sodium excretion rate after ANF infusion was positively correlated with the basal sodium excretion rate (r = 0.579; p less than 0.05) and inversely correlated with basal plasma renin activity (r = -0.623; p less than 0.05). Furthermore, the plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) after infusion of ANF was significantly decreased compared with the basal level. The maximal change in PAC was closely correlated with the basal PAC (r = -0.857; p less than 0.01). However, no significant effect on hemodynamic variables was detected with infusion of ANF. Although additional studies are needed to assess the clinical efficacy of ANF infusion in acute MI, our observations suggest that low-dose infusion of the peptide is potentially valuable, as either sole or adjunctive therapy, for the management of water-sodium retention in acute MI.\r"

  ".W": "To study the relationship between plasma alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-ANP) and cardiac function in patients with Duchenne's progressive muscular dystrophy (DMD), we measured plasma alpha-ANP levels in 51 patients with DMD and evaluated them according to the clinical severity of the disease and the echocardiographic left ventricular function. In many of the patients with DMD, plasma alpha-ANP levels were mildly elevated, but no clear correlation was observed between alpha-ANP levels and wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle. The alpha-ANP level was moderately or markedly elevated (81 to 120 pg/ml) in 3 of the 16 patients with respiratory failure and extremely high (1208 pg/ml) in the one patient with congestive heart failure. Two patients with respiratory failure and one with congestive heart failure, in whom alpha-ANP levels were elevated, died within 2 months. Elevation of left atrial pressure as a result of left ventricular dysfunction caused by impairment of the myocardium and elevation of right atrial pressure as a result of pulmonary hypertension caused by impairment of the respiratory muscles are considered to be involved in the mechanism of increased plasma alpha-ANP levels in patients with DMD. It can be concluded that a moderate or marked elevation in plasma alpha-ANP levels in patients with terminal DMD is a sign of a poor prognosis and may be a useful index for the management of the disease.\r"

A sub-sample of 71 patients and 50 control subjects was examined 3 years later. Tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor plasma levels were higher in patients versus control subjects at 3 months and at 3 years after myocardial infarction, with a high degree of correlation between the 2 determinations (r = 0.87). Of all hemostatic parameters studied, only low tissue plasminogen activator activity and increased tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor levels were significantly different between patients with and without recurrent infarction during the 3-year period. In those patients with a second infarction greater than 3 years later, however, tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor concentration was not significantly related to reinfarction.\r"

A significant (p = 0.038) 50% relative reduction in the incidence of late potentials was observed in the group of 35 patients who underwent reperfusion: from 16 of 35 (46%) before to 8 of 35 (23%) at 120 minutes after the start of thrombolytic treatment. No significant reduction was seen in the 19 patients in whom thrombolysis was unsuccessful: from 8 of 19 (42%) before to 7 of 19 (37%) afterward. Despite successful recanalization, late potentials persisted or newly developed after thrombolytic therapy in 8 of 54 patients (15%). It is concluded that successful thrombolysis reduces the incidence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram but that the sensitivity and specificity of this finding are not high enough to allow reliable monitoring of coronary reperfusion at the bedside.\r"

Compared with normal adults, baseline plasma taurine and urine taurine-creatinine ratios were decreased in both groups and platelet taurine was reduced in the taurine-treated group. During taurine treatment the mean of the mean values for taurine became normal in plasma and platelets and remained normal in erythrocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes; urine taurine-creatinine ratios rose to approximately five times normal. During follow-up, patients not given taurine had plasma, erythrocyte, and granulocyte taurine and urine taurine-creatinine ratios below normal values and the concentrations of taurine-treated patients. Their platelet taurine was also subnormal. Thus, 10 mg taurine.kg-1.d-1 intravenously normalizes plasma and blood cell taurine concentrations in long-term TPN patients.\r"

Indirect calorimetry at day 7 showed a higher fat oxidation (0.21, -0.31 to +0.60 vs 1.18, 0.70 to 1.95 g. kg-1.d-1, respectively, P less than 0.02, median and interquartile range) in group B and a higher protein oxidation (0.37, 0.30-0.43 vs 0.63, 0.53-0.88 g.kg-1.d-1, P less than 0.001). The time to regain birth weight was also higher in group B (7, 5.5-9 vs 9, 7-14 d, P less than 0.05). Carnitine supplementation and calorie intake were the best explanatory variables for metabolic rate (R2 = 0.45, P less than 0.002). We conclude that carnitine supplementation of TPN in this dosage does not seem advisable.\r"

Lipoprotein X (LPX) detected soon after IL infusions were started reached its highest concentrations in group A. LPX concentrations correlated with phospholipid intakes on days 7 and 15 but not on day 29. Significant increases in the cholesterol and phospholipid content of low-density-lipoprotein-very-low-density-lipoprotein fractions were observed only in group A. It is suggested that these changes were induced by the twofold-higher intake of phospholipids in group A. With regard to the possible involvement of LPX in lipid overloading of the reticuloendothelial system and hepatocytes, administration of 20% IL seems preferable to 10% IL.\r"

The diets were all well tolerated and there were no untoward effects. Plasma glutamine concentrations increased significantly with glutamine administration but plateaued at concentrations approximately 25% above control values. Ammonia and glutamate, potentially toxic metabolites of glutamine, did not change significantly with glutamine enrichment. Nitrogen balance and hormonal concentrations were unchanged during the three dietary periods. Results of mental-status examinations and continuous performance testing were normal and unchanged throughout the three periods.

One group was fed continuously for 24 h, the other was fed only at night, ie, from 1700 to 0900 the next morning. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher (P less than 0.01), nitrogen balance better (P less than 0.05), and urinary catecholamine excretion higher (P less than 0.05) in the 24-h-fed patients than in the night-fed patients. Postoperatively, feeding at night only is more energy efficient than is feeding continuously for 24 h, but is associated with poorer nitrogen balance.

The following results were obtained for the 11 neoplasms that were immunostained: neuron-specific enolase 11/11(+), S-100 protein 8/11(+), microtubule-associated protein-2 8/11(+), class III beta-tubulin isotype 9/11(+), neurofilament 200 kD 8/11(+), synaptophysin 7/11(+), glial fibrillary acidic protein 1/11(+), chromogranin A 1/11(+), vimentin 1/11(+), keratin (CAM 5.2) 4/11(+), keratin (AEI/AE3) 0/11(+), and epithelial membrane antigen 0/11(+). Expression of two intermediate filaments was found in 4 of the 11 tumors. The authors' data showing that 72% of olfactory neuroblastomas were S-100 protein positive and only one was immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein agree with other published immunohistochemical studies. With only a single exception, each of the 11 neoplasms was labeled with one or more antibodies that detect neuronal cytoskeletal proteins (class III beta-tubulin isotype, microtubule-associated protein-2, neurofilament 200 kD). These immunohistochemical results are complementary to the reported electron microscopic findings of intermediate filaments and microtubules in olfactory neuroblastomas.\r"

Eighty-six percent of CD8-positive cells from marrow expressed the pan-T-cell markers CD2 and CD3, compared with 91% and 81%, respectively, of CD8-positive cells from peripheral blood. Virtually all CD8-positive marrow lymphocytes, however, were negative for CD11b as opposed to peripheral blood, where 18% exhibited positivity for this marker. Further, a higher percentage of marrow CD8-positive T-lymphocytes expressed HLA-DR (15.4%) than did those from peripheral blood (4%). Marrow CD4-positive subsets did not differ substantially from those of peripheral blood. These results support the concept of a selective homing of CD8-positive T-cells to the marrow and indicate that CD8-positive T-cells in the marrow are effector T-cells.\r"

  ".U": "91051439\r", 
  ".W": "To better define the clinical and biological evolution of infants after vertical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, we analyzed 94 consecutive infected patients followed up after their first clinical symptoms. The expression of clinical symptoms and biological abnormalities followed a bimodal distribution, some patients having an early and severe disease and the others having a slowly progressive one. One third of our patients suffered from early onset of opportunistic infection (OI). These patients had a significantly higher incidence of severe encephalopathy compared with patients without OI. The rate of survival at 3 years was 48% +/- 24%. In contrast, the patients without early OI or severe encephalopathy had a probability of survival at 3 years of 97% +/- 3%. This probability was not modified by the occurrence of bacterial infection or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis occurred at a mean age of 29 months, significantly later than OI or severe encephalopathy. Laboratory results at initial examination were correlated with clinical symptoms. Thus, when the number of CD4 lymphocytes was less than 500/mm3, children suffered more frequently from life-threatening symptoms (OI and severe encephalopathy): 15 of 22 vs 14 of 69. The same was true when the lymphocytes did not proliferate after antigenic stimulation, when anti-p18 and/or anti-p25 antibodies were absent in the serum, and when p24 antigen was detected in serum. Finally, severe encephalopathy was associated with low anti-human immunodeficiency virus cerebrospinal fluid antibody titer, whereas 88% of patients with moderate or no encephalopathy had signs of intrathecal anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibody synthesis. In conclusion, a subgroup of patients expressed very early signs of severe immunodeficiency and encephalopathy, whereas the majority of patients had a longer survival and less severe clinical symptoms during their first years of life than previously thought.\r"

To assess the hydrolytic capability of lactase-containing tablets taken immediately before oral lactose challenge, we studied 18 children previously identified as being lactose intolerant and having no underlying organic gastrointestinal disease. Subjects had a mean (+/- SEM) age of 11.4 +/- 3.4 years; 72% were male. At time of the study, lactase-containing tablets or placebo tablets were ingested (double-blind) immediately before drinking a solution of lactose. Breath samples were obtained for hydrogen analysis at 30-minute intervals during a 2-hour period, and clinical symptoms were monitored. In lactose-intolerant patients, hydrogen production was significantly greater following placebo (maximum hydrogen excretion, approximately 60 ppm) compared with lactase-containing tablets (maximum hydrogen excretion, 7 ppm). Increased hydrogen production was associated with clinical symptoms including abdominal pain (89% of subjects following placebo ingestion), bloating (83%), diarrhea (61%), and flatulence (44%). These results indicate, therefore, that coingestion of lactose and lactase-containing tablets significantly reduces both breath hydrogen excretion and clinical symptoms associated with lactose intolerance.\r"

Among the operative procedures, right thoracotomy with extensive lymphoadenectomy had the highest rate of PHB (87%), perhaps due to the longest operation time and the largest intraoperative blood loss. Preoperative risk factors were glucose intolerance, reduced lymphocyte count, and poor nutritional state. The change in bile acid composition, as well as the elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, indicated the presence of postoperative cholestasis which was relevant to total parenteral nutrition. The results suggest that the development of PHB was related to the extent of surgery and the use of parenteral nutrition.\r"

The temporal profile of urinary NT G-34-IR excretion in normal subjects represented three peaks corresponding to each meal. In contrast, the profile in antrectomized patients and patients under total parenteral nutrition (TPN) represented a flat pattern. Urinary NT G-34-IR excretions during fasting 2-h periods in antrectomized patients and TPN patients were about one-sixth and one-third, respectively, of basal NT G-34-IR excretion in normal subjects (53.1 +/- 13.9 pmol/h). Total urinary NT G-34-IR excretion during 24 h both in antrectomized patients (220 +/- 35 pmol/24 h) and TPN patients (390 +/- 68 pmol/24 h) was also significantly lower than in normal subjects (1985 +/- 403 pmol/24 h). The present study showed that the main source of urinary NT G-34-IR is the gastric antrum, that the main factor fluctuating its excretion is food intake, and that long-term TPN reduces basal gastrin secretion. Urinary NT G-34-IR would be a useful indicator for total gastrin secretion.\r"

Ten healthy volunteers were given 50 ml 40% ethanol through an endoscope onto the duodenal mucosa 1-7 cm from the pyloric sphincter; 3 min later, misoprostol (200 micrograms) or inert vehicle (5 ml) was given locally in the same way. One and 5 h later, endoscopy was repeated to evaluate the damage. The conditions of the mucosa were evaluated by endoscopy and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy in biopsies taken at time 0 and 3 min, 1 and 5 h after ethanol. The study was double-blind with a cross-over balanced design. Three minutes after ethanol administration, the duodenal mucosa showed hyperemia with hemorrhagic lesions. Under the electron microscope, the lesions were caused by vascular engorgement or red blood cell extravasation into the submucosa; the epithelium underlining lesions showed loss of superficial cells and damage to the upper layer of the mucosa. One hour after ethanol, there was a striking difference between the two treatment groups, with a substantial recovery of the duodenal epithelium in the misoprostol-treated volunteers. Although spontaneous recovery was evident in the control group, there was also a significant difference at 5 h. Our results suggest that prostaglandins are able to stimulate the recovery of the duodenal epithelium after acute damage.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty men aged 65 to 86 with chronic constipation were studied in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial in which lactulose and 70% sorbitol (0 to 60 mL daily) were each given for 4 weeks preceded by a 2-week washout period. RESULTS: The average number of bowel movements per week was 6.71 with sorbitol and 7.02 with lactulose (95% confidence interval of the difference: -0.43 to 1.06), and the average number of days per week with bowel movements was 5.23 with sorbitol and 5.31 with lactulose (95% confidence interval of the difference: -0.32 to 0.48). Eleven patients stated a preference for sorbitol, 12 for lactulose, and seven had no preference. On a visual analogue scale measuring severity of constipation (0 to 100 mm), the average score for sorbitol was 35.6 mm versus 37.1 mm for lactulose (95% confidence interval of the difference: -6.4 to 9.3). The sorbitol and lactulose treatment periods were also similar in percent of bowel movements recorded as \"normal,\" frequency and severity of symptoms such as bloating, cramping, and excessive flatulence, and overall health status as assessed by a previously validated five-category questionnaire. There were no significant differences between sorbitol and lactulose in any outcome measured except nausea, which was increased with lactulose (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that sorbitol and lactulose have no clinically significant differences in laxative effect. Sorbitol can be recommended as a cost-effective alternative to lactulose for the treatment of constipation in the elderly.\r"

In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia did not develop (17 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated, beginning in the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy as found previously in normotensive pregnant women (n = 58). Plasma estradiol and progesterone levels also increased progressively. In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia developed (13 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated in the first trimester as in the other groups. However, later in pregnancy significant differences were observed. Blood pressure began to rise in the second trimester. Initially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system remained stimulated, but in the early third trimester, when preeclampsia was diagnosed, plasma renin activity and urine aldosterone excretion decreased, and atrial natriuretic factor increased. These data provide information that may be useful in the recognition of superimposed preeclampsia, and in the investigation of its pathogenesis.\r"

Histologic examination indicated atrophy and regression of the endometrial explant. These atrophic changes of endometrial explant were also induced by danazol, leuprolide, and the combination treatment. However, the volume of explants after combination therapy with danazol and leuprolide (1.8 +/- 1.0 mm3, n = 17) was significantly less than that after therapy with danazol (11.6 +/- 2.8 mm3, n = 20) or leuprolide alone (5.9 +/- 1.4 mm3, n = 24). The combination therapy (16/17) was also shown to be superior to danazol (9/20) or leuprolide alone (14/24) to induce the regression of fluid in experimental endometriosis. As expected, administration of leuprolide decreased the serum estradiol level, but use of danazol did not. These findings suggest that a combination therapy of danazol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, which show different modes of action, may be a potential modality in treatment of patients with advanced endometriosis.\r"

  ".W": "The development of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea reflects an individual's response to environmental stressors and life-style variables. In this disorder there are no detectable anatomic abnormalities with respect to the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian-endometrial axis. Current evidence suggests that the common underlying defect is a decrease in the activity of the hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator. Of the neuroendocrine factors that appear to regulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone activity, the opiate and dopamine neuronal systems have been implicated as factors that are responsible in part for the decreased secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Because of the functional nature of this disorder, reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit would be expected to take place in most women after accommodation to environmental stressors or modification in life-style. For women with persistent anovulation, treatment with estrogen-replacement therapy should be offered. In those desiring fertility, ovulation induction with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone would be the most effective modality.\r"

However, this form of therapy is apparently less effective in polycystic ovary syndrome. The administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog for 4 to 8 weeks before the initiation of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction can temporarily correct endocrine abnormalities of polycystic ovary syndrome, such as excessive luteinizing hormone and androgen secretion, and improve ovulatory and pregnancy rates in these patients. For optimal results, this pretreatment should probably be repeated before each pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction cycle. Obesity is associated with a lower success rate, and spontaneous abortion remains a prominent complication in polycystic ovary syndrome even after gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog suppression. With this regimen the risks of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy are virtually abolished. Thus, pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone appears to be highly effective and safe for ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome also, provided that this treatment is preceded by pituitary-ovarian suppression with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog.\r"

Furthermore, pulsatile (versus continuous) luteinizing hormone-releasing stimulation of the pituitary gland is an absolute requirement for normal gonadotropin secretion. Men with idiopathic oligoazoospermia and selective elevation of follicle-stimulating hormone levels have slow luteinizing hormone and presumably luteinizing hormone-releasing pulse frequency. In these men, pulsatile luteinizing hormone--releasing treatment is effective in decreasing serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels, but it is unclear whether spermatogenesis and fertility are improved.\r"

Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency is clinically and neuroendocrinologically heterogeneous, largely because of variation in the degree of gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency. Treatment with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone results in normal pubertal changes and virilization. Such treatment has been uniformly successful in normalizing release of gonadotropins and secretion of testosterone. Improvement in secondary sex characteristics and induction of spermatogenesis have been achieved in most patients. Eight of nine patients desiring induction of fertility were able to father a child. Use of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone presents a powerful model in which to examine regulation of gonadotropin secretion and the role of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone in control of the male reproductive axis.\r"

Overall complications of intravenous line placement ranged from 0% to 11% (mean = 7%). A 12% incidence of multiple pregnancy was noted, and a single case of ovarian hyperstimulation was reported in a woman who also received clomiphene citrate. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment appears to be of at least comparable efficacy to human menopausal gonadotropins, with the added benefit of reduced overall risks for the patient with hypothalamic amenorrhea.\r"

The cytoplasmic staining patterns in rats and humans were essentially the same and were not related to the extent of inflammation ie, the size of lymphoid infiltration.

Immunocytochemically brain APP was localized in neurons and their processes. During sperm formation, APPs labeled by both antisera were localized only in acrosome and the growing tail of spermatids in the seminiferous tubules. This shows that APPs appear only in particular phases of spermatogenesis, that is, in the morphologic change phase from spermatid to mature sperm. Amyloid beta-protein precursors in testis may play a role in cellular differentiation or morphologic change.\r"

Animals treated with monocrotaline had new well-differentiated arteries and veins on their pleural surfaces. Animals not treated had no large vessel on their pleural surfaces. Animals receiving monocrotaline had capillaries around major arteries that were more dense, widened, and less tubular than normal. These capillaries occasionally occurred in sheets and had blind endings. The control animals had delicate, uniform, tubular capillaries. Alveolar capillaries in both groups showed no evidence of increase in size or number or change in shape. Light microscopy confirmed the finding of new vessels found with the casts. The finding of angiogenesis on the pleural surface and in the bronchovascular bundle, but not in the alveolar capillaries, suggests a basic difference in how these capillary beds respond to angiogenic stimuli. If alveolar capillaries are unable to undergo angiogenesis, concepts of lung development and tumor growth may be significantly altered. The lung may be a unique organ to study angiogenesis because of the different angiogenic potential of its two circulations. Study of these differences may lead to better understanding of inhibition of angiogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular immunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this report the potential role of these cells in the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms by immunohistochemistry was investigated. Aortic tissues from 32 patients were examined: 4 normal aortas, 6 aortas with occlusive atherosclerotic disease, 17 abdominal aortic aneurysms, and 5 inflammatory abdominal aneurysms. Using monoclonal anti-CD3 (T cells), anti-CD19 (B cells), anti-CD11c (macrophages), anti-CD4 (T helper cells), and anti-CD8 (T suppressor cells), several distinctions among these groups were found. The amount of inflammatory cell infiltrate was as follows: inflammatory aneurysms more than abdominal aortic aneurysms more than occlusive aortas more than normal aortas. CD3-positive T lymphocytes rarely were found in the adventitia of normal or occlusive aortas. In contrast, abdominal aortic aneurysms and inflammatory aneurysms exhibited most of the CD3-positive infiltrates in the adventitia. CD19-positive B lymphocytes were present mainly in the adventitia of all pathologic tissues. The CD4-positive:CD8-positive ratio was greater in abdominal aortic aneurysms and inflammatory aneurysms than in the other groups, both in the adventitia and in the media of the aortas. CD11c-positive macrophages were present throughout the diseased tissues, often surrounded by lymphoid aggregates; the greatest numbers of macrophages were found in the inflammatory aneurysm group. Our data suggests that the aneurysmal disease may progress from occlusive disease and is accompanied by an increase in chronic inflammatory cells as well as a redistribution of these cell types. Therefore it is suggested that aneurysmal disease may represent an immune-mediated event.\r"

This strain has been shown to have a unique repeat region which differs from the previously described P. vivax CS proteins. A total of 21/343 human sera were found to react with a synthetic peptide representing the variant P. vivax repeat. All of the sera that reacted with the variant repeat peptide, (ANGAGNQPG)4, also reacted with variant P. vivax sporozoites. Both the anti-peptide and the antisporozoite reactivity were totally abolished by adsorption with the variant peptide. Some of the human sera contained variant antibodies that were species specific and could only be adsorbed with the specific variant peptide. These findings suggest that the variant strain of P. vivax might have a worldwide distribution. We also found that some of the variant positive sera reacted with P. brasilianum sporozoites and with the P. brasilianum/P. malariae CS repeat. The adsorption of these sera with the P. brasilianum/P. malariae repeat peptide, (NAAG)4, significantly reduced the reactivity of these sera with the P. vivax variant. In addition, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies of mice immunized with P. brasilianum sporozoites cross-reacted with the variant P. vivax CS. These findings suggest that exposure to P. brasilianum or P. malariae may give rise to sporozoite antibodies which cross-react with the P. vivax variant CS.\r"

Proliferative responses were correlated with the protective status of each strain. Proliferative reactivities to sporozoite antigens were compared in cultures containing either CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, or total splenic lymphocytes. CD8+ T cells had no proliferative activity to sporozoite antigens; CD4+ T cells and splenic lymphocytes responded to the priming antigen, but the responses varied according to the mouse strain tested. The proliferative activity diminished at the onset of protection, presumably due to the induction of regulatory or non-proliferative T cell subsets. Sporozoite-immune lymphocytes did not respond to P. berghei circumsporozoite synthetic peptides. The restricted utilization of T cell epitopes during anti-sporozoite responses can be interpreted as resulting in part from a limited processing of the CS protein antigen.\r"

There was also a positive correlation between anti-HBs titers and the diameters of the portal vein. There was no correlation between anti-HBs titers and any of the following 3 parameters: liver span in the mid-clavicular line (right lobe) alone, liver span in the middle line (left lobe) alone, and the degree of thickness of the periportal fibrosis.

A recently developed transesophageal Doppler device, Accucom 2, features technological advances aimed to reduce the error of this approach to the monitoring of cardiac output. To determine if Accucom 2 enables more accurate cardiac output monitoring, a prospective investigation was undertaken. Analyses of 923 simultaneous measurements of transesophageal Doppler and thermodilution cardiac output in 47 anesthetized patients were compared. Results using Accucom 2 were highly correlated with the results obtained with thermodilution (R = 0.91) and provided significantly greater accuracy in comparison with a previously developed Doppler cardiac output monitor, Accucom 1. Technological advances in transesophageal Doppler ultrasound hold promise for clinically useful noninvasive monitoring of cardiac output.\r"

  ".W": "More than 80 deaths have occurred after the use of midazolam (Versed), often in combination with opioids, to sedate patients undergoing various medical and surgical procedures. We investigated the respiratory effects of midazolam (0.05 mg.kg-1) and fentanyl (2.0 micrograms.kg-1) in volunteers. The incidence of hypoxemia (oxyhemoglobin saturation less than 90%) and apnea (no spontaneous respiratory effort for 15 s) and the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide were evaluated. Midazolam alone produced no significant respiratory effects. Fentanyl alone produced hypoxemia in half of the subjects and significant depression of the ventilatory response to CO2, but did not produce apnea. Midazolam and fentanyl in combination significantly increased the incidence of hypoxemia (11 of 12 subjects) and apnea (6 of 12 subjects), but did not depress the ventilatory response to CO2 more than did fentanyl alone. Adverse reactions linked to midazolam and reported to the Department of Health and Human Services highlight apnea- and hypoxia-related problems as among the most frequent adverse reactions. Seventy-eight per cent of the deaths associated with midazolam were respiratory in nature, and in 57% an opioid had also been administered. All but three of the deaths associated with the use of midazolam occurred in patients unattended by anesthesia personnel. We conclude that combining midazolam with fentanyl or other opioids produces a potent drug interaction that places patients at a high risk for hypoxemia and apnea. Adequate precautions, including monitoring of patient oxygenation with pulse oximetry, the administration of supplemental oxygen, and the availability of persons skilled in airway management are recommended when benzodiazepines are administered in combination with opioids.\r"

Thirty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four groups: group 1 (n = 10) received 70% N2O in O2; group 2 (n = 12) received 70% N2O in O2, plus ganglionic blockade; and group 3 (n = 10) received 70% N2O in O2, plus ganglionic blockade and catecholamine infusion. In groups 1-3, ischemia was produced by right carotid occlusion combined with hemorrhagic hypotension (35 mmHg) for 30 min. Group 4 (n = 6) received 70% N2O in O2 and hemorrhagic hypotension without carotid occlusion for 30 min. At the end of ischemic and nonischemic hypotension, the carotid artery was unclamped and the blood slowly reinfused. Neurologic outcome was evaluated for a 5-day period with a graded deficit score (0 = normal to 39 = stroke-related death). Brain histopathology was evaluated in coronal section at the level of the caudate nucleus according to a 6-point scale, from 0 = normal to 5 = total hemispheric infarction. Arterial blood gases, pH, and body temperature were kept constant in all groups. Compared to N2O alone (group 1), treatment with ganglionic blockade (group 2) decreased plasma catecholamines by 75% and significantly improved neurologic outcome from incomplete cerebral ischemia (P less than 0.05). Administration of exogenous epinephrine and norepinephrine in the presence of N2O and ganglionic blockade (group 3) worsened neurologic outcome compared to group 2 (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective review of 190 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. SETTING: City limits of a midsized southwestern city. The events studied took place outside of medical facilities. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for whom the EMS system was activated by a 911 telephone request for emergency medical assistance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cost, including training, personnel, equipment, and response time maintenance, per year of life saved was found to be $8,886.00 for paramedic care. This result was compared with published cost-effectiveness figures for heart transplantation, liver transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, and chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Paramedic care was more cost effective, as measured by cost per year of life saved, than organ transplantation and chemotherapy for acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: Out-of-hospital treatment by paramedics of cardiopulmonary arrest is more cost effective than heart, liver, bone marrow transplantation, or curative chemotherapy for acute leukemia.\r"

  ".U": "91052702\r", 
  ".W": "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is characterized by the accumulation of a lipoproteinaceous material within the alveoli of the lung. It is well established that patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis have a high incidence of complicating pulmonary infections possibly resulting from defects of antibacterial functions of alveolar macrophages. Moreover, for unclear reasons, an inflammatory response in the airways is frequently absent. In order to investigate the role of the lipoproteinaceous material in these two patterns, we tested the in vitro effects of a lavage fluid from a human pulmonary alveolar proteinosis on the secretion of reactive oxygen intermediates and arachidonic acid metabolites by normal guinea pig alveolar macrophages. After incubation with the lipoproteinaceous material, the luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence of zymosan-triggered alveolar macrophages was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion. The lipoproteinaceous material similarly reduced the chemiluminescence response in a cell-free xanthine-xanthine oxidase system generating superoxide anions. This latter observation suggests that the lipoproteinaceous material acts as a scavenger for superoxide anions produced by alveolar macrophages. Its purified protein or phospholipid fractions also resulted in a general inhibition of the secretion of arachidonic acid metabolites by alveolar macrophages challenged in vitro with zymosan. Our results suggest that the alveolar filling material of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis may inhibit the action of antibacterial and/or proinflammatory agents produced by alveolar macrophages. We speculate that such effects of the lipoproteinaceous material may play a role in vivo in the high incidence of pulmonary infections and in the absence of discernible interstitial or intraalveolar inflammation seen in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.\r"

Each subject performed hyperventilation challenges of 4, 8, and 16 min. No significant bronchoconstriction occurred until the hyperventilation was stopped, regardless of its duration. We found increased bronchoconstriction as the duration of hyperventilation increased. The declines in FEV1 (mean +/- SD) from baseline were 13 +/- 10%, 22 +/- 7%, and 29 +/- 12% for 4, 8, and 16 min of hyperventilation, respectively (1 versus 3, p less than 0.01). Mean times after hyperventilation until maximal bronchoconstriction were 12 +/- 4 min, 9 +/- 6 min, and 6 +/- 4 min. We also found slight bronchodilation during the first 4 min of hyperventilation. After 2 and 4 min of hyperventilation, the FEV1 was 103 +/- 5% and 103 +/- 3% of baseline, respectively (both p less than 0.05, compared to baseline). We conclude that increasing the duration of hyperventilation delays the onset of bronchoconstriction but causes greater bronchoconstriction once the hyperventilation is stopped. These results suggest that either hyperventilation itself inhibits bronchoconstriction or that the mechanisms that induce bronchoconstriction in response to hyperventilation operate after, rather than during, hyperventilation.\r"

We stratified surgical readmissions by the number of times the patient was readmitted to surgery (from one to five times). For surgical patients 41.1 per cent of the readmission population was readmitted more than once, only 4.4 per cent were readmitted five or more times. Patients requiring three or more admissions generally had the greatest hospital resource utilization, financial risk under DRG payment, and mortality, compared with other surgical readmissions. This analysis suggests that within the surgical readmission population resource parameters may differ by the number of readmissions per patient. Factors were identified which corresponded to a greater likelihood of surgical readmission, and possibly allow the focus of outpatient services which may reduce hospital inpatient costs in the future.\r"

To address when revascularization is indicated, we constructed a decision analytic model. Our model incorporates procedure-related mortality and morbidity, coronary artery disease-related mortality, and the benefit of revascularization. We determined the quality-adjusted life expectancy and expected costs for each strategy. Our model suggests that angioplasty is a reasonable alternative to bypass surgery in patients with favorable lesions if angioplasty would provide a comparable degree of revascularization. Our model predicts that patients treated with angioplasty will have more revascularization procedures than will patients treated with bypass surgery but predicts that both treatments will cost the same over the typical patient's lifetime. In many patients with severe angina or documented ischemia, angioplasty is indicated for stenosis of a single artery. In patients with two vessel disease that is amenable to angioplasty, angioplasty may be a reasonable alternative to bypass surgery. Even in patients whose three vessel disease can be completely revascularized by angioplasty, bypass surgery, although relatively expensive, is slightly better than angioplasty. In patients with three vessel disease and comorbidities that increase operative risk, angioplasty may be a reasonable alternative to either bypass surgery or medical therapy.\r"

DESIGN: Uncontrolled clinical trial, with assay of serum, peripheral blood cells, and bone marrow for virus using DNA hybridization and immunocytochemistry techniques; these assays were then correlated with clinical findings, results of immunoassays for antivirus antibodies, and with immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy. SETTING: Government medical referral center, and university and private hospitals. PATIENTS: Seven patients with pure red cell aplasia and serologic evidence of infection with HIV-1. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients had giant pronormoblasts in the bone marrow (present in transient aplastic crisis caused by acute B19 parvovirus infection). High concentrations of B19 parvovirus were demonstrated in sera, in several cases in samples separated by weeks or months. Viral DNA and capsid protein were present in the bone marrow of three patients studied, and active viral replication was detected by southern analysis. There was no antivirus IgG in capture immunoassay and no or very low levels of antivirus IgM. The patients did not have symptoms of fifth disease, the illness caused by this virus in immunologically normal persons. Six patients were treated with a regimen of intravenous commercial immunoglobulin. In all cases, this therapy resulted in rapid reduction in serum virus concentrations and full recovery of erythropoiesis. Relapses in two cases were predicted by DNA hybridization studies, and these cases were successfully retreated. CONCLUSIONS: The B19 parvovirus is a remediable cause of severe chronic anemia in HIV-infected patients. Recognition of and therapy for parvovirus in this population will avoid erythrocyte transfusion and should prevent transmission of the virus to other persons, including immunosuppressed persons and women of child-bearing age.\r"

Keratinocytes within psoriatic plaques and within delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have been shown to stain strongly with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody prepared against interferon-gamma-induced protein 10, suggesting a possible role for interferon gamma in the production of the lesions. A psoriasiform eruption has been seen in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Its severity appears to correlate with the degree of immunodeficiency in the early stages of AIDS. We stained 10 lesions of psoriasiform dermatitis of AIDS with the anti-interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 antibody using immunoperoxidase techniques. As controls, we studied 10 lesions of non-AIDS psoriasis, six lesions of seborrheic dermatitis with psoriasiform hyperplasia, one lesion of lichen simplex chronicus, and four biopsy specimens of normal skin from patients with AIDS. In addition, normal skin specimens taken from patients with AIDS and human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients at time of autopsy were examined. An identical, strong and diffuse staining pattern was seen in all cases of psoriasiform dermatitis of AIDS, non-AIDS psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and lichen simplex chronicus. The specimens of normal skin showed only weak basal layer staining with anti-interferon-gamma-induced protein 10. Thus, the presence of interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 in keratinocytes was associated with psoriasiform hyperplasia and could be detected in both AIDS-associated and classic psoriasis.\r"

There were considerable quantitative changes in the faecal flora preceding the clinical onset of both definite and possible episodes of necrotising enterocolitis. There was a decline in the numbers of some species from up to 72 hours before the clinical onset of the disease. Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from samples collected during the 48 hours preceding the clinical onset of all four definite episodes of necrotising enterocolitis. These were 'new' isolates in two episodes, and considerably increased numbers in another. The changes that we found are probably the result of changes in intraluminal conditions that precede the clinical onset of necrotising enterocolitis.\r"

Available total parenteral nutrition (TPN) not containing glutamine does not prevent these changes, while TPN enriched with glutamine has been shown to have beneficial effects on postoperative skeletal muscle protein metabolism. Glutamine, in the form of a dipeptide, alanyl-glutamine, was added to TPN. Patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy were given postoperative TPN. Two groups received isocaloric and isonitrogenous conventional TPN, one group with (n = 8) and the other without an addition of alanyl-glutamine (n = 8). Skeletal muscle protein metabolism was studied in muscle biopsy specimens from which the muscle free amino acid pattern and the concentration and size distribution of ribosomes, serving as a measure of protein synthesis, were determined. In the control group, muscle free glutamine decreased by 38.8% +/- 6.6% and the polyribosome concentration per mg of DNA decreased by 21% +/- 5.2% after operation. In the group given TPN supplemented with alanyl-glutamine, these two parameters of muscle protein and amino acid metabolism did not change significantly. Compared to the control group, whole-body nitrogen balance was improved after operation by the addition of alanyl-glutamine to TPN (p less than 0.01). Muscle free glutamine and muscle protein synthesis were preserved after operation and the whole-body nitrogen balance was improved by adding glutamine in the form of alanyl-glutamine to TPN. The dipeptide alanyl-glutamine seems to be a suitable means of providing glutamine in a stable form.\r"

St. Thomas' Hospital solution caused the cells to contract, resulting in disruption of monolayer integrity and opening of intercellular gaps, and resulted in a 24-hour postexposure survival of 51.0% +/- 2.4%. Bretschneider HTK solution altered cellular morphology less and produced the best postexposure survival (80.2% +/- 2.6%; p less than 0.001). Although morphology was altered the least with University of Wisconsin solution, postexposure survival with this solution, which was similar to that with modified Collins solution, was superior to that with St. Thomas' (p less than 0.01) but inferior to that with Bretschneider HTK (p less than 0.05). The superior protection provided by Bretschneider HTK was due to its additives histidine, tryptophan, and KH-2-oxygluterate (p less than 0.005), and to its low chloride content (p less than 0.005). Furthermore, modifying St. Thomas' solution by decreasing its chloride content improved cell survival to 71.2% +/- 2.3% (p less than 0.001). Normothermic (37 degrees C) exposure to Bretschneider HTK, modified Collins, and University of Wisconsin solution was cytotoxic, whereas normothermic exposure to St. Thomas' cardioplegia was not. In conclusion, the preservation solution that is the least harmful to endothelial cells at hypothermia is Bretschneider HTK cardioplegic solution.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred twenty-one consecutive adult cardiac surgical patients were examined prospectively for nutritional protein state, acute phase protein response, and delayed hypersensitivity reaction in an attempt to identify patients at high risk for the development of sternal wound infection, which occurred in 6 patients (2.7%). There was no significant correlation between preoperative nutritional protein concentrations (retinol-binding protein, prealbumin, and transferrin) and acute phase protein levels (C-reactive protein, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and complements B and C3), nor a statistically significant relationship between nutritional state or acute phase protein response and the development of sternal infection. Preoperative complement C3 levels were elevated, however, in 80.0% of those in whom sternal infections developed compared with 30.6% of those with well-healed wounds. Similarly, postoperative concentrations of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein were elevated in 80.0% of those in whom sternal infections developed compared with 28.6% of those with well-healed wounds. There was no correlation between delayed hypersensitivity and the risk of sternal infection, nor between preoperative nutritional protein and acute phase protein values. Seventy-three percent of patients were anergic on postoperative day 2. Stepwise logistic regression showed that age, body weight, preoperative intensive care unit stay, repeat median sternotomy, internal mammary artery grafting, postoperative hemorrhage, and postoperative cardiac arrest correlated with the development of sternal infection, whereas transfusion requirement, reexploration for bleeding, and the operation performed did not. We conclude that routine delayed hypersensitivity testing is of no value in predicting high-risk cardiac surgical patients when the anergy battery is placed on the preoperative day. Although statistically insignificant, possibly due to the small number of patients in whom sternal infection developed in this study (type II error), a larger study might find preoperative complement C3 and post-operative alpha 1-acid glycoprotein levels to be predictive of patients at risk for the development of sternal wound infection. The final logistic model for the predicted risk 2%) of sternal wound infection is: PREDSWC = exp(EQ)/1 + exp(EQ) where EQ = (0.38 x age) + (0.24 x weight) + (5.42 x preop ICU) + (4.39 x redo) + (7.14 x IMA) + (4.49 x hemorrhage) + (8.81 x arrest) - 62.72, and where preop ICU, redo, hemorrhage, and arrest are defined as yes (1) or no (0), IMA-is defined as 0, 1, or 2, age is in years, and weight is in kilograms.\r"

In 6 of 11 motor cortices, a proportion of pyramidal cells also stained positively for IgG. No such reactivity was noted in motoneurons of control human tissues, although positive IgG staining was present in astrocytes of ALS and control specimens. Reactive microglia and/or macrophages were detected in the territory of degenerating pyramidal tracts and ventral horns. The surface of most of these cells stained positively for IgG, and 50% stained positively for HLA-DR. The accumulation of IgG in motoneurons and the presence of immunologically active macrophages provide additional evidence for the participation of immunologic factors in the pathogenesis of ALS.\r"

One of the most active immunologic messengers is interferon gamma, which has been observed in our laboratories to also have a direct cytotoxic effect on cultures of squamous cell carcinoma derived from the head and neck. To test the feasibility of treating patients with advanced but resectable head and neck cancer with this agent, we designed a phase I-II trial of recombinant human interferon gamma using a 24-hour infusion repeated weekly for four times. In this study, both tumor and immunologic parameters were studied before and after treatment. Eight patients were entered into the study with the highest recombinant human interferon gamma dose attempted being 0.25 mg/m2 per 24 hours. Minimal side effects were observed. Three patients had clinically measurable responses, four had stabilization of disease, and one had progression while receiving treatment. Histopathologic results of treatment were similar to in vitro observations. Necrosis, as well as differentiation of tumor cells, was observed. In some tumors there was a marked decrease in cellularity without a change in tumor volume due to increased extracellular keratin deposition. Our study indicates that evaluation of adoptive immunotherapy trials in head and neck cancer needs to include parameters other than simple tumor regression as an end point, otherwise therapeutically important lymphokine-induced changes may be missed. Further evaluation of recombinant human interferon gamma and agents that induce human interferon gamma are warranted.\r"

These progenitors are considered to be mature BFU-E. The activity is found in extracts from kidney cells and appears to be physiologically regulated as it was respectively enhanced and decreased in kidneys from anemic and polycythemic mice. The disappearance of activity in kidney-cell extracts during long-term polycythemia correlated with an accumulation of mature BFU-E in the spleen and bone marrow of polycythemic mice. Using specific neutralizing antibodies and in vitro tests, we also show that this activity is different from hemopoietins known to share burst promoting activity (Interleukin-3 [IL-3], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], Interleukin-4 [IL-4], erythropoietin [EPO], human interleukin for DA cells [HILDA]) and that it can stimulate erythroid differentiation in long term bone marrow cell cultures.\r"

  ".W": "The cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), induce a dose-dependent production of both granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) in cultured human synovial cells, as measured by immunoassay. With IL-1, significant levels of both CSFs were first detected within 6 to 12 hours, with a maximum reached 24 to 48 hours after commencement of stimulation. A synergistic effect was detected between IL-1 and TNF in production of both CSFs in these cells. No evidence was obtained for the IL-1-induced effect to be mediated by induction of endogenous TNF nor for the TNF-induced stimulation to involve IL-1. IL-1-stimulated synovial cells were shown to secrete biologically active GM-CSF and G-CSF, which were specifically inhibited by their respective monoclonal antibodies. The transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, and protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, inhibited the increase in GM-CSF and G-CSF production induced by IL-1 and TNF. Finally, other cytokines, IL-3, interferon gamma (IFN gamma), IL-2, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha), failed to stimulate either GM-CSF or G-CSF production, whether alone or in the presence of IL-1. These results suggest that cytokine-stimulated synovial fibroblasts may be a major source of intraarticular CSF production in the joints of patients with inflammatory arthritis; as a result, monocyte/macrophages and granulocytes may be activated, leading to perpetuation of the inflammation and destructive events occurring in these lesions.\r"

The three doses of rt-PA produced the same extent of thrombolysis both in the two groups treated with heparin (34% +/- 6%, 52% +/- 7%, and 79% +/- 8% in the lower dose group; 39% +/- 6%, 49% +/- 4%, and 81% +/- 6% in the higher dose group) and in the group treated with saline (37% +/- 4%, 47% +/- 5%, and 84% +/- 7%). In the thrombus growth inhibition studies 0.5 mg of rt-PA was infused over 3 hours in each rabbit. In addition, the rt-PA-treated rabbits were randomized to receive heparin, 20 or 60 antifactor Xa U/kg/h over 6 hours, or saline. At the end of infusion, no statistically significant differences in thrombus growth were found in three groups of rabbits (54.8 +/- 7.4 micrograms and 52.4 +/- 12.1 micrograms in the low and high dose of heparin groups, respectively, and 59.4 +/- 10.4 micrograms in the saline group). In different experiments rabbits were randomized to receive heparin, 60 antifactor Xa U/kg/h, or saline at the end of the rt-PA infusion. In these experiments heparin inhibited thrombus growth more efficiently than saline (41.1 +/- 6.5 micrograms and 58.7 +/- 12.9 micrograms, respectively, P less than .05). In vitro experiments confirmed that heparin is unable to prevent fibrin accretion on the clots during lysis with rt-PA while both D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2-Cl (PPACK) and hirudin are able to prevent the accretion of fibrin. We conclude that the data obtained in these animal models do not support the concomitant use of heparin and rt-PA. However, heparin could be used successfully after rt-PA to inhibit thrombus growth.\r"

These studies identified a subset of CVID consisting of 14 of the 38 patients with a distinctive T-cell immunophenotype and clinical findings. The phenotypic changes were characterized by an abnormally low CD4/CD8 ratio (less than or equal to 0.9) due primarily to a significant increase in CD8 T cells. In addition, there was an expansion in CD8 T cells coexpressing CD57 and increased expression of the activation markers HLA-DR and interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) by these cells. This group of immunophenotypically abnormal CVID patients also had characteristic clinical features, including splenomegaly (P less than .02) and in vivo T-cell dysfunction based on the evaluation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (P less than .05). Approximately 71% of these patients had splenomegaly and 42% were anergic in contrast to the remaining group of CVID patients, in which 29% had splenomegaly and 7% were anergic. These findings define a subgroup of CVID patients that have specific immunophenotypic features and functional T-cell abnormalities.\r"

  ".U": "91055109\r", 
  ".W": "To develop a sensitive and specific assay for minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we exploited the enormous diversity of genomic sequences created by immune receptor gene rearrangements. To isolate clone-specific sequences, we first synthesized oligonucleotides that match conserved variable (VH) and joining (JH) sequences flanking the third hypervariable region (HVR3) in the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus. In polymerase chain reactions (PCR), these primers were then used to amplify the intervening HVR3 segments from leukemic DNA samples. Of 12 B-lineage ALLs studied, ten generated one or more fragments of the size expected for HVR3 gene segments. Thus, this single pair of amplimers was sufficient to isolate HVR3 sequences from a majority of acute lymphoblastic leukemias. To verify that the amplified fragments originated from HVR3 alleles and to assess their diversity, we sequenced 7 PCR products derived from 6 leukemias. In addition to elements of recognized D segments, each of the 7 fragments contained novel VH-D and D-JH junctional sequences, including N nucleotides, not known to be present in the germline. Each sequence was unique, and allele-specific oligonucleotide probes hybridized only to HVR3 segments from which the probes were derived. Therefore, as anticipated, these HVR3 segments appeared to possess the diversity required to serve as clonal markers for leukemic populations. To demonstrate that these amplified HVR3 alleles could serve as the basis for a sensitive and specific assay to detect rare leukemic cells, we analyzed in detail one pre-B leukemia that had rearranged 2 IgH alleles. The HVR3 sequences were shown to be linked to rearranged JH-containing restriction fragments in digests of genomic DNA, establishing their origin in the leukemic cells. We synthesized oligonucleotides corresponding to the unique junctional sequences in the HVR3 segments. Using these novel amplimers in an allele-specific amplification and hybridization procedure, we showed that this assay can detect 10 leukemic cells in a background of 10(6) normal blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, the leukemic HVR3 sequences were not detected in extracts of normal or unrelated remission leukemic leukocytes. We conclude that the assay for specific IgH HVR3 sequences is a realistic strategy for detection of minimal residual disease in B-lineage ALL.\r"

Measured fluxes of Na+ and K+ in ouabain-inhibited cells, of chloride and sulfate exchange in 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS)-inhibited and untreated cells, and of erythritol, mannitol, and arabinose in cytochalasin B-inhibited cells indicated that a deoxygenation-induced permeability change occurred in sickle cells only for cations and chloride. Monovalent cation permeabilities increased five-fold, and chloride influx into DIDS treated cells was enhanced nearly threefold on sickle cell deoxygenation. In contrast, no detectable increase in permeability to the other solutes was found. To gain perspective on these findings, similar measurements were performed in normal cells treated with diamide, an agent shown by others to induce a coupled increase in membrane permeability and phospholipid translocation, reminiscent of deoxygenation-induced changes in sickle cells. Although the increase in cation permeability was no greater than that in sickled cells, treatment with 2 mmol/L diamide also produced a twofold increase in the first order rate constants for sulfate exchange and mannitol efflux, indicating a relatively nonselective permeability increase that permitted flux of larger solutes than in the case of deoxygenated sickle cells. These results suggest that the deoxygenation of sickle cells induces a permeability increase that is relatively insensitive to charge, but is restrictive with respect to solute size.\r"

DESIGN--Single blind, placebo controlled study in patients receiving fixed sodium and potassium intakes. SETTING--Blood pressure unit of a teaching hospital in south London. PATIENTS--Eight patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension who had been taking nifedipine 20 mg twice daily for at least six weeks. INTERVENTIONS--Withdrawal of nifedipine and replacement with matching placebo for one week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Urinary sodium excretion and cumulative sodium balance, body weight, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations, and blood pressure. RESULTS--During nifedipine withdrawal there was a significant reduction in urinary sodium excretion (day 1: -62.7 mmol/24 h; 95% confidence interval -90.3 to -35.0) and each patient retained a mean of 146 (SEM 26) mmol sodium over the week of replacement with placebo. Body weight and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations increased during the placebo period and seemed to be associated with the amount of sodium retained. Systolic blood pressure rose from 157 (9) to 165 (9) mmHg (95% confidence interval of difference -7.1 to 22.1) when nifedipine was replaced with matching placebo, and the rise seemed to be related to the amount of sodium that was retained. CONCLUSIONS--Nifedipine causes a long term reduction in sodium balance in patients with essential hypertension. This long term effect may contribute to the mechanism whereby nifedipine lowers blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Episodes of transient myocardial ischemia during ambulatory activities are common in patients with stable coronary artery disease and who are often asymptomatic. Selection of therapy for episodes of asymptomatic ischemia is limited by a lack of direct comparative studies. To determine the most effective monotherapy for patients with stable angina and a high frequency of asymptomatic ischemic episodes, propranolol-LA (mean daily dose, 293 mg), diltiazem-SR (mean daily dose, 350 mg), nifedipine (mean daily dose, 79 mg) were each compared with placebo, each for 2 weeks, in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover trial. Entry criteria were a positive exercise treadmill test during placebo therapy characterized by 1.0 mm or more ST segment depression and angina pectoris, and six or more episodes of transient ST segment depression of 1.0 mm or more on a 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram. One hundred ninety-four patients were screened, 63 were eligible and received randomized therapy, of which 56 patients completed at least two of the four treatment periods and were included in an intent-to-treat analysis. Fifty patients completed all four treatment phases and were included in the protocol-completed analysis. Anti-ischemia efficacy was assessed by 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, exercise treadmill tests, and anginal diaries. Ninety-four percent of all episodes of ambulatory ischemia were asymptomatic. Compared with placebo, only propranolol was associated with a marked reduction in all manifestations of asymptomatic ischemia during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (2.3 versus 1.0 episodes/24 hr; mean duration of ischemia per 24 hours, 43.6 versus 5.7 minutes; both p less than 0.0001). Diltiazem's reduction of the frequency of episodes compared with placebo (2.3 versus 1.9 episodes/24 hr) was associated with a trend (p = 0.08) in the protocol-completed analysis and with a significant reduction in the intent-to-treat analysis (p = 0.03). Nifedipine had no significant effect on any measured variable of ambulatory ischemia. The dosages of medication used may have been excessive for some patients, and a more beneficial effect may have been evident at a lower dose. In contrast to the marked effects of the active agents on ambulatory asymptomatic ischemia, the effects on exercise performance and angina pectoris were slight. The active agents modestly improved treadmill exercise duration time until 1 mm ST segment depression (3%), and only propranolol and diltiazem had significant effects. Only diltiazem significantly prolonged the total exercise time. Anginal frequency was significantly decreased by both propranolol and diltiazem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) elicited a marked, approximately 5-23-fold, enhancement of pro alpha 2(I) collagen promoter activity, which was accompanied by an elevation of type I procollagen mRNA levels. This enhancement of gene expression was suppressed by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), as determined at mRNA steady-state level, but two distinct mechanisms were involved. TNF-alpha suppressed the pro alpha 2(I) collagen promoter activity, whereas IFN-gamma had only a minimal effect at transcriptional level. The effects of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma were synergistic, suggesting that combination of these two factors may potentially provide pharmacologic means to counteract tissue deposition of collagen in diseases involving TGF-beta.\r"

Other studies have shown that the c-jun protooncogene is expressed during phorbol ester-induced myeloid differentiation. This work examines the effects of ara-C on c-jun gene expression in human KG-1 myeloid leukemia cells. The results demonstrate that c-jun transcripts are undetectable in uninduced KG-1 cells and that ara-C induces expression of this gene in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Ara-C treatment was also associated with increases in c-jun transcripts in U-937, THP-1, and HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. Furthermore, transcriptional run-on analysis has demonstrated that exposure to ara-C increases the rate of c-jun gene transcription. The results also demonstrate that while inhibition of protein synthesis superinduces c-jun mRNA levels in phorbol ester-treated KG-1 cells, cycloheximide had no effect on the induction of c-jun transcripts during ara-C treatment. Moreover, the half-life of c-jun transcripts in ara-C-treated KG-1 cells was 42 min. These findings suggest that the increase in c-jun mRNA observed during ara-C treatment is regulated by a transcriptional mechanism, and that c-jun may be involved in the induction of differentiation and regulation of gene expression by ara-C.\r"

Phosgene caused no increase in lung generation of cyclooxygenase metabolites and no elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure, but markedly increased transvascular fluid flux (delta W = 31 +/- 5 phosgene vs. 8 +/- 1 g unexposed, P less than 0.001), permeability to albumin (125I-HSA) lung leak index 0.274 +/- 0.035 phosgene vs. 0.019 +/- 0.001 unexposed, P less than 0.01; 125I-HSA lavage leak index 0.352 +/- 0.073 phosgene vs. 0.008 +/- 0.001 unexposed, P less than 0.01), and lung malondialdehyde (50 +/- 7 phosgene vs. 24 +/- 0.7 mumol/g dry lung unexposed, P less than 0.01). Ibuprofen protected lungs from phosgene (delta W = 10 +/- 2 g; lung leak index 0.095 +/- 0.013; lavage leak index 0.052 +/- 0.013; and malondialdehyde 16 +/- 3 mumol/g dry lung, P less than 0.01). Because iron-treated ibuprofen failed to protect, we studied the effect of ibuprofen in several iron-mediated reactions in vitro. Ibuprofen attenuated generation of .OH by a Fenton reaction and peroxidation of arachidonic acid by FeCl3 and ascorbate. Ibuprofen also formed iron chelates that lack the free coordination site required for iron to be reactive. Thus, ibuprofen may prevent iron-mediated generation of oxidants or iron-mediated lipid peroxidation after phosgene exposure. This suggests a new mechanism for ibuprofen's action.\r"

The clearance of PC organisms from the alveolar space is a critical function of alveolar macrophages (AM), the resident alveolar phagocytic cells. In this study the mechanism of PC attachment to AM was determined using 51Cr-labeled organisms, with PC attachment reaching a maximum of 18.9 +/- 2.5% after 4 h. Attachment was significantly decreased by preincubation of the AM with a monoclonal anti-fibronectin antibody directed against the cell attachment site of fibronectin (from 17.8 +/- 2.2% to 8.3 +/- 1.0%, P less than 0.01), or by addition of the fibronectin cell binding site analogue Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) (from 18.1 +/- 2.3% to 2.9 +/- 0.8%, P less than 0.01). An anti-fibronectin monoclonal antibody directed against the heparin binding domain of fibronectin had no effect on PC attachment. Addition of the specific calcium ion chelating agent EGTA to the culture media similarly decreased attachment from 16.9 +/- 2.0% to 5.1 +/- 1.1% (P less than 0.01). Fibronectin-mediated attachment of PC to AM did not result in phagocytosis of the organisms by the AM as determined by chemiluminescence measurements. Therefore, the data indicate that PC attachment to AM is a calcium-dependent process mediated by the cell binding domain of fibronectin which does not trigger a phagocytic response by the AM.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular remodeling is central to the pathophysiology of hypertension and atherosclerosis. Recent evidence suggests that vasoconstrictive substances, such as angiotensin II (AII), may function as a vascular smooth muscle growth promoting substance. To explore the role of the counterregulatory hormone, atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in this process, we examined the effect of ANP (alpha-rat ANP [1-28]) on the growth characteristics of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells. ANP (10(-7) M) significantly suppressed the proliferative effect of 1% and 5% serum as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation and cell number, confirming ANP as an antimitogenic factor. In quiescent RASM cells, ANP (10(-7), 10(-6) M) significantly suppressed the basal incorporations of 3H-uridine and leucine by 50 and 30%, respectively. ANP (10(-7), 10(-6) M) also suppressed AII-induced RNA and protein syntheses (by 30-40%) with the concomitant reduction of the cell size. Furthermore, ANP also significantly attenuated the increase of 3H-uridine and leucine incorporations caused by transforming growth factor-beta (4 x 10(-11), 4 x 10(-10) M), a potent hypertrophic factor. These results indicate that ANP possesses an antihypertrophic action on vascular smooth muscle cells. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by 24-h treatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate did not inhibit ANP-induced suppression on 3H-uridine incorporation. Based on the observation that ANP was more potent than a ring-deleted analogue of ANP on inhibiting 3H-uridine incorporation, we conclude that the ANP's inhibitory effect is primarily mediated via the activation of a guanylate cyclase-linked ANP receptor(s). Indeed 8-bromo cGMP mimicked the antihypertrophic action of ANP. Accordingly, we speculate that in addition to its vasorelaxant and natriuretic effects, the antihypertrophic action of ANP observed in the present study may serve as an additional compensatory mechanism of ANP in hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of arterial O2 content on the mechanism of muscle O2 utilization, we studied the effect of 2, 11, and 20% carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) on O2 uptake (VO2), and CO2 output (VCO2) kinetics in response to 6 min of constant moderate- and heavy-intensity cycle exercise in 10 subjects. Increased COHb did not affect resting heart rate, VO2 or VCO2. Also, the COHb did not affect the asymptotic VO2 in response to exercise. However, VO2 and VCO2 kinetics were affected differently. The time constant (TC) of VO2 significantly increased with increased COHb for both moderate and heavy work intensities. VO2 TC was positively correlated with blood lactate. In contrast, VCO2 TC was negatively correlated with increased COHb for the moderate but unchanged for the heavy work intensity. The gas exchange ratio reflected a smaller increase in CO2 stores and faster VCO2 kinetics relative to VO2 with increased COHb. These changes can be explained by compensatory cardiac output (heart rate) increase in response to reduced arterial O2 content. The selective slowing of VO2 kinetics, with decreased blood O2 content and increased cardiac output, suggests that O2 is diffusion limited at the levels of exercise studied.\r"

HCV RNA was detected in 13 of 16 (81%) anti-HCV-positive patients and also in 7 of 14 (50%) anti-HCV-negative patients, but in none of 10 anti-HCV-negative healthy subjects. Specificity of this method was confirmed by direct sequencing of amplified cDNA segment. The nucleotide sequences (37 nucleotides) obtained from 15 patients showed only 68-78% homology compared with the prototype HCV nucleotide sequence. In addition, of 15 nucleotide sequences, there were 12 different types. But the translated amino acid sequences (12 amino acids) showed 83-100% homology compared with the prototype HCV amino acid sequence. These data suggest the majority of anti-HCV-positive patients are carriers of HCV. But to detect all the viremic patients, the anti-HCV antibody testing may be insufficient. Direct detection of HCV RNA may be useful in the study of virus replication and its association with various liver diseases.\r"

They are also inhibitory to the transformation of C3H/3T3 cells by Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV). In vivo, they are only marginally effective in delaying MSV-induced tumor formation, and mortality associated therewith in newborn NMRI mice. When combined with ribavirin, DDI and ddDAPR become much more effective in inhibiting MSV and HIV replication in vitro and MSV-induced tumor formation in vivo. These observations point to the potential role of ribavirin in potentiating the anti-HIV activity of DDI in AIDS patients.\r"

To determine if the increase in the production of these cytokines corresponded with disease activity, we studied the production of IL-1 and TCIM by PBMC from patients with different stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Eight patients with asymptomatic seropositive infection, three patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC), three patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), and six patients meeting the full criteria for diagnosis of AIDS were studied. Patients with AIDS produced increased amounts of TCIM (4.1 times control values, p less than 0.003) and IL-1 (2.0 times control values, p less than 0.05). In contrast, asymptomatic seropositive patients produced less TCIM (0.36 times control values, p less than 0.004) and IL-1 (0.61 times control values, p less than 0.05). Different trends in the levels of these factors produced by patients with ARC and PGL were noted, although results were not statistically significant in general. Patients with ARC tended to produce less IL-1 (0.42 times control values, p less than 0.05), whereas patients with PGL tended to produce increased amounts of IL-1 (1.7 times control values, NS). ARC patients produced a wide range of TCIM values (0.05-2.8 times control values, NS), and patients with PGL tended to produce increased TCIM values, (4.0 times control values, p less than 0.02). No correlations between the levels of IL-1 or TCIM and T-cell subpopulation numbers (CD4 or CD8) or CD4/CD8 ratios were found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Synthetic rat ANF(99-126) and the clearance receptor antagonist C-ANF (10(-12)-10(-9) M) inhibited basal and 5 microM vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induced cAMP generation in a concentration-dependent manner. These actions of ANF and C-ANF were blocked by 12-18 h pretreatment with PTX (100 ng/ml), suggesting ANF receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase via an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein. Both ANF (10(-11)-10(-9) M) and C-ANF (10(-11)-10(-8) M) also inhibited K(+)-induced catecholamine release in a concentration-dependent manner. ANF (10(-11)-10(-8) M) increased cGMP generation in a concentration-dependent manner but C-ANF did not. The accumulation of cGMP in response to ANF was not altered by treatment with PTX. Therefore, PTX dissociated the increased concentrations of cGMP from the ANF-mediated depression of evoked catecholamine release. C-ANF also dissociated elevations in cGMP concentrations from an ANF-mediated attenuation of evoked catecholamine release. The results of this study indicate that ANF inhibits adrenergic neurotransmission independent of guanylate cyclase.\r"

In the presence of a low concentration of coenzyme A (2.5 microM), the R-(-)enantiomer (which forms an acylcoenzyme A) inhibited stereoselectively the beta oxidation of [1-14C]palmitic acid but not that of [1-14C]palmitoyl-L-carnitine (which can directly enter the mitochondria). In the presence, however, of a concentration of coenzyme A (50 microM) reproducing that present in liver cell cytosol, both enantiomers (2 mM) slightly inhibited the beta oxidation of [1-14C]palmitic acid and markedly inhibited the beta oxidation of [1-14C]octanoic acid and [1-14C]butyric acid. In vivo, both enantiomers (1 mmol.kg-1) similarly inhibited the formation of [14C]CO2 from [1-14C]fatty acids. Both enantiomers similarly decreased plasma ketone bodies. Both similarly increased hepatic triglycerides, and both produced mild microvesicular steatosis of the liver. We conclude that both ibuprofen enantiomers inhibit beta oxidation of fatty acids in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the R-(-)enantiomer may stereoselectively sequester coenzyme A; at low concentrations of coenzyme A in vitro, this may stereoselectively inhibit the mitochondrial uptake and beta oxidation of long chain fatty acids.\r"

SR 33557 prevented completely the binding of (+)-[3H]PN200-110, (-)-[3H]D888 and cis-(+)-[3H]diltiazem to their specific binding sites in an apparently competitive manner (nH congruent to 1.0) and with a high affinity (Ki = 0.5-2.0 nM). Equilibrium and kinetic studies suggest that SR 33557 does not act as a simple competitive antagonist at the 1,4-dihydropyridine, the phenylalkylamine or the benzothiazepine-selective sites associated with the L-type calcium channel: 1) inhibition of (-)-[3H]D888 and cis-(+)-[3H]diltiazem binding by SR 33557 resulted in a decrease in maximum binding, 2) cis-(+)-diltiazem and (+)-PN200-110 allosterically increased the inhibition of (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding and of (-)-[3H]D888 and cis-(+)-[3H]diltiazem binding by SR 33557, respectively and 3) dissociation kinetics of the three radioligands were accelerated by SR 33557. Calcium (in millimolar concentrations) decreased the apparent affinity of SR 33557 for its high-affinity binding sites. This observation was similar to that seen with the phenylalkylamines and cis-(+)-diltiazem, but contrasted from that seen with the 1,4-dihydropyridines. These results indicate that SR 33557 interacts with a high affinity to a novel binding site associated with the L-type calcium channel and has a strong negative allosteric interaction with the well-characterized binding sites for 1,4-dihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines and benzothiazepines.\r"

Treatment with CG3703 at 45 min after trauma in rabbits significantly attenuated decreases in intracellular pH and reversed increases in phosphodiester to phosphomonoester ratio, as shown by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The improved phosphodiester/phosphomonoester ratio was correlated with improved ATP status after treatment, although there was no improvement in aerobic bioenergetic capacity as reflected by phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate ratios. In rats, treatment with CG3703 significantly reduced changes in tissue cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+) and water content following trauma, but did not significantly alter the accumulation of free fatty acids or thromboxane B2. Thus, the beneficial effects of treatment with thyrotropin-releasing hormone or thyrotropin-releasing hormone analogs on outcome following traumatic spinal cord injury may be due, in part, to actions relating to ion homeostasis.\r"

Brush border membrane vesicles were prepared from bovine choroid plexus and the uptake of [3H]cimetidine was studied using the methods of rapid vacuum filtration and scintillation counting. Cimetidine accumulated in the vesicles with time reaching equilibrium within 2 hr. The amount of cimetidine taken up by the vesicles at equilibrium decreased with increasing extravesicular media osmolarity suggesting that cimetidine accumulates in an osmotically reactive intravesicular space. Binding of cimetidine to the membrane was estimated to be less than 18%. Michaelis-Menten studies demonstrated that cimetidine transport involved both a saturable and a nonsaturable component. The Vmax and Km (mean +/- S.E.) were 16.7 +/- 5.9 pmol/sec/mg protein and 58.1 +/- 3.1 microM, respectively, suggesting that cimetidine is transported across the choroid plexus brush border membrane with a lower affinity and a higher capacity than across the renal brush border membrane. The organic cation, quinidine (0.1 mM), and the amino acid, histidine (20 mM), both significantly reduced the initial, but not the equilibrium, uptake of cimetidine. However, high concentrations (5 mM) of more polar organic cations including tetraethylammonium, as well as of several organic anions including salicylate did not inhibit cimetidine transport. Studies with unlabeled cimetidine revealed a countertransport phenomenon. Attempts to drive the concentrative uptake of cimetidine with various ion gradients were unsuccessful. Of note was the fact that an outwardly directed proton gradient could significantly accelerate the uptake of cimetidine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A genetically determined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between quinidine and single doses of encainide in healthy volunteers has previously been described. In subjects with the extensive metabolizer phenotype, quinidine blunted encainide-induced QRS prolongation (a marker of sodium channel block) because it impaired encainide biotransformation to the potent active metabolites O-desmethyl encainide (ODE) and 3-methoxy-O-desmethyl encainide. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that quinidine would inhibit sodium channel block (and by inference arrhythmia suppression) during encainide therapy in patients with the extensive metabolizer phenotype. Surprisingly, however, in eight extensive metabolizer patients, the extent of QRS prolongation during chronic encainide therapy was unaltered by quinidine (139 +/- 21 vs. 139 +/- 22 msec) whereas arrhythmia suppression was enhanced (64 +/- 22 to 77 +/- 19%; P = .05). Plasma concentration data demonstrated that although encainide metabolism to ODE was partially impaired by quinidine, subsequent 3-methoxy-O-desmethyl encainide formation from ODE was virtually completely inhibited; thus steady-state plasma ODE remained unchanged whereas plasma encainide increased 10-fold (21 +/- 30 to 240 +/- 118 ng/ml; P less than .05). In contrast, no changes in disposition or in pharmacodynamics were observed in two poor metabolizers. It is concluded that the effect of this drug interaction in patients is determined by differential sensitivities to inhibition by quinidine of encainide O-demethylation and subsequent ODE 3-methoxylation. Evaluation of potential drug interactions should include assessment of possible genetic factors as well as of steady-state effects.\r"

In the present study, pharmacologic experiments were performed on carbachol-contracted (0.34 microM) guinea-pig trachea contracted further with ChTX in order to determine if Ca(++)-activated K+ channels play a role in the responses to cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent bronchodilators. Relaxation concentration response curves to the beta-agonists, isoproterenol and salbutamol; the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, aminophylline; the cAMP mimic, N6-2'-O-adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate the guanylate cyclase activator, sodium nitroprusside; and the K+ channel agonists, BRL-34915 and pinacidil, were obtained in the absence and presence of ChTX. The concentration response curves to isoproterenol and salbutamol were shifted to the right (approximately 27-fold and greater than 40-fold, respectively) by 180 nM ChTX, whereas concentration response curves to N6-2'-O-adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate and aminophylline were affected significantly less (shifted approximately 7.5-fold). Concentration response curves to the cGMP-dependent relaxant sodium nitroprusside were also altered by ChTX (17-fold rightward shift at 180 nM). In the presence of 60 nM ChTX, the concentration response curves to the above relaxants were shifted only 3- to 5-fold. In contrast, ChTX (60 and 180 nM) failed to produce a significant rightward shift in the concentration response curves to BRL-34915 or pinacidil. Relaxation to BRL-34915 was however, blocked by glybenclamide, suggesting differences in the mechanism of relaxation. Contraction of tissues with depolarizing concentrations of KCl (20-80 mM) inhibited responses to all bronchodilators. These results suggest that hyperpolarization of tracheal smooth muscle as a result of opening various types of K+ channels can lead to relaxation of carbachol-contracted tracheal smooth muscle.\r"

Six days later the same procedure was repeated, each subject being assigned to the other posture. Diuresis, chlor- and natriuresis were about 50% greater (P less than .01) in the supine than in the upright posture up to 45 min after dose, despite no significant difference in urinary drug excretion between the postures. Creatinine clearance and fractional sodium excretion were also significantly (P less than .05) greater in the supine posture. Pharmacodynamic analysis with the Emax model revealed that the maximum drug response (Emax) to furosemide in the upright posture was significantly (P less than .01) attenuated by about 65% of that in the supine posture, with no significant difference in either ER50 (urinary drug excretion rate producing 50% of Emax) or slope between the postures. Plasma norepinephrine concentration was significantly (P less than .05) greater, whereas urinary kallikrein excretion was significantly (P less than .05) less in the upright posture. There were no significant differences in blood pressure, plasma renin activity and atrial natriuretic peptide as well as in urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2, dopamine and adenosine between the postures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Inhibition by U-73122 was not mediated by an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP. In contrast, the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and the subsequent rapid increase in cytosolic Ca++ induced by either thrombin or the thromboxane-mimetic, (5Z,9 alpha, 11 alpha, 13E, 15S) 15-hydroxy-11,9-(epoxymethano)prosta- 5,13,-dien-1-oic acid (U-46619), was inhibited by U-73122 but not by U-73343. Reduction of IP3 levels appeared to reflect an inhibition of IP3 production because the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl[3H]inositol and phosphatidyl[3H]inositol 4,5-bisphosphate catalyzed by a soluble fraction from platelets was inhibited by U-73122 (Ki = 9 and 40 microM, respectively). In addition, U-73122 inhibited thromboxane B2 production induced by collagen but not that supported by exogenously added arachidonic acid, suggesting that U-73122 also inhibited receptor-coupled mobilization of arachidonic acid. After preincubation of platelets with [3H]arachidonic acid, the loss of [3H]phosphatidylinositol and accumulation of [3H]phosphatidic acid induced by thrombin was attenuated by U-73122. U-73122 did not inhibit the activities of phospholipases A2 purified either from porcine pancreas or from the venoms of Crotalus adamanteus and Naja naja. Although U-73122 inhibited neither the conversion of exogenous arachidonic acid to thromboxane B2 nor the binding of the thromboxane receptor antagonist [1S-[1 alpha, 2 beta (5Z), 3 beta, 4 alpha]]-7-[3-[[2- [2-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]- hydrazino]methyl]-7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1]-hept-2-yl-5-heptenoic acid to platelet membranes, it was an effective inhibitor of arachidonic acid-induced aggregation of platelets. These data are consistent with the observed inhibition by U-73122 of platelet activation by the thromboxane receptor agonist, U-46619, via a mechanism that involves inhibition of a phospholipase C-dependent component(s) of signal transduction. U-73122, but not U-73343, inhibited also N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced aggregation of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and the associated production of IP3 and diacyglycerol. Diradylglycerol produced in PMN stimulated with N-formyl- methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine was 74 +/- 7% saponifiable and inhibited by U-73122 (Ki = 2 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the functions of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels in cerebral arterial smooth muscle, the effects of cromakalim, an opener of these channels, on tension and 86Rb efflux were investigated in endothelium-removed strips of dog middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). Cromakalim relaxed the strips that were precontracted with 20.9 mM K+ with a small maximum response. The relaxant responses to cromakalim were competitively antagonized by glibenclamide, a blocker of KATP channels. In strips precontracted with 65.9 mM K+, cromakalim failed to relax the strips. The addition of cromakalim to a resting strip caused a dose-dependent relaxation. In the resting strips of MCAs preloaded with 86Rb, cromakalim did not increase the 86Rb efflux. With 42K as the tracer ion, cromakalim still had no effect on the efflux from the resting strips. On the other hand, cromakalim increased the 86Rb and 42K efflux from the strips of dog coronary arteries (CAs). In 20.9 mM K(+)-contracted strips of MCAs, cromakalim significantly decreased the 86Rb efflux. However, after the inactivation of Ca(++)-activated K+ channels by the addition of 1 x 10(-7) M nifedipine to the 20.9 mM K(+)-contracted strips of MCAs, cromakalim produced a small but significant increase in the 86Rb efflux. Similarly, when the resting strips of MCAs were placed in the Ca(++)-free 12 mM-Mg(+)+ solution, cromakalim increased the 86Rb efflux. In 65.9 mM K(+)-contracted strips, cromakalim increased the 86Rb efflux from both arteries. However, the extent of the increase in 86Rb efflux was significantly smaller in the MCA than in the CA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nitroglycerin, up to 0.3 micrograms/kg, selectively increased circumflex artery diameter (CxAD) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter. In contrast, cromakalim and pinacidil at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0.3 micrograms/kg simultaneously and dose-dependently increased CxAD, coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure. Cromakalim was approximately 8- to 9.5-fold more potent than pinacidil in increasing CxAD. Vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cromakalim and pinacidil were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug-induced tachycardia was abolished. When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant, the increases in CxAD induced by cromakalim (10 micrograms/kg), pinacidil (30 micrograms/kg) and nitroglycerin (10 micrograms/kg) were reduced by 68 +/- 7, 54 +/- 9 and 1 +/- 1%, respectively. Thus, whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow-independently dilates large coronary arteries, cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors-mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand. Finally, two mechanisms at least, direct vasodilation and flow dependency, are involved in the cromakalim- and pinacidil-induced increase in CxAD.\r"

  ".U": "91056496\r", 
  ".W": "Adenosine, acting at A1 and A2 purine nucleoside receptors, regulates the physiology of many tissues. Myometrial smooth muscle from pregnant guinea pigs, which is contracted by the actions of adenosine, possesses an A1 receptor whose agonist affinity is regulated by guanine nucleotides. In addition to its expected effect on the affinity of the A1 receptor for agonist, the addition of guanine nucleotide also dramatically increases antagonist binding by as much as 62%. This action of guanine nucleotides on adenosine A1 receptors is common to many smooth muscle preparations and suggests the possibility that GTP-binding proteins might alter the conformation of the adenosine receptor in such a way that receptors not previously able to bind ligands are recruited by the guanine nucleotide. Such an action of guanine nucleotides would alter our general view of the interaction of antagonists with GTP-binding protein coupled receptors, as well as bear significantly on the interpretation of experimental data designed to characterize purinergic receptors. Thus, we have investigated the actions of guanosine-5'-O-[3-thiotriphosphate] on A1 adenosine receptor binding in membranes prepared from pregnant guinea pig myometrium containing 61% right-side-out vesicles. We show that guanosine-5'-O-[3-thiotriphosphate] lowers the affinity of adenosine A1 receptors for agonist in vesicles leading to increased competition of antagonist radioligand for receptor. We suggest that the endogenous adenosine we measure originates from breakdown of significant amounts of adenine nucleotides present in membranes vesicles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that opening membrane vesicles to remove trapped adenosine yields maximal antagonist radioligand binding without subsequent effects of guanosine-5'-O-[3-thiotriphosphate]. We conclude that the presence of endogenous adenosine, unavailable to the actions of adenosine deaminase, is responsible for the effect of guanine nucleotides to increase antagonist binding to adenosine A1 receptors.\r"

We investigated the effect of iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analog, on microvascular permeability in a rat striated muscle model. In six control and six experimental animals the cremaster muscle was dissected, placed in a closed-flow acrylic chamber, and suffused with a bicarbonate buffer solution. Dextran labeled with fluorescein was injected intravenously as a macromolecular tracer, and microvascular permeability was determined on the basis of clearance of the fluorescent tracer. Two hours of ischemia were followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. In the experimental group iloprost (0.5 microgram/kg/min) was given in a continuous intravenous infusion. Microvascular permeability increased significantly during reperfusion in both control and experimental animals (p less than 0.0001). Treatment with iloprost, however, significantly attenuated this response compared to the control group, 4.8 +/- 0.3 versus 7.3 +/- 0.5 microliters/gm/min, respectively (p less than 0.0001). Iloprost decreases the rise in vascular permeability after ischemia and reperfusion. Experimental clinical use of iloprost under controlled conditions in the treatment of patients with acute skeletal muscle ischemia appears justified.\r"

Cost estimates reflect societal resource consumption. Annual costs for therapy ranged from $327 (niacin) to $1881 (lovastatin, 80 mg/d). Niacin was the most efficient agent for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, having an average cost over 5 years of $139 per percent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Lovastatin (20 mg/d) was also efficient ($177 per percent reduction). Cholestyramine was least efficient at $347. For high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, niacin was most efficient, at $116 per percent increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, followed by gemfibrozil at $271. Analyses combining low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol effects suggest that niacin and lovastatin (20 mg/d) were most efficient for reducing cardiovascular risk.\r"
