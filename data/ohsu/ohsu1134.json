  ".W": "We studied the pathogenesis, clinical features, and management of posterior capsular breaks in 28 cataract patients during planned extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation surgery. In the age-related cataract group (17 cases), the posterior capsular breaks were fresh, caused by the irrigation-aspiration cannula. Located in the upper part of the posterior capsule, they had thin margins and tended to enlarge with continued irrigation. Nine (52.9%) of these breaks could be plugged with viscoelastic, and after dry aspiration, a posterior chamber lens was implanted successfully. Posterior capsular breaks in traumatic cataracts (11 cases) were preexisting but were detected only during surgery. Centrally located, they had thick fibrosed margins and remained the same size during irrigation- aspiration. The minimal vitreous herniation seen in four (35.3%) of these cases was managed by automated partial anterior vitrectomy through the break. A posterior chamber intraocular lens was implanted in all these cases.\r"

The mean decrease in acuity was 2.83 lines on a Jaeger near card. Postinjection visual acuity did not change in four eyes. In general, the longer the globe axial length, the greater the decrease in visual acuity following retrobulbar block. There was no significant correlation between postinjection acuity and patient age or volume of anesthetic injected.\r"

The surgeon must anticipate and prepare for the difficulties of working with marbleized, ultra-dense bone, alternating technique accordingly. In nasolacrimal duct obstruction, surgical management produces seemingly stable long-term results. However, if ossification recurs at the operative site, reoperation may become necessary for either optic nerve decompression or dacryocystorhinostomy.\r"

Higher rates of pupillary capture have been associated with sulcus fixation and nonangulated flexible (polypropylene) haptics. Contraction of the capsular bag on the flexible polypropylene haptics of this silicone lens is thought to force the optic anteriorly, increasing the probability of lens capture by the iris.\r"

All five of these eyes have a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Six vitrectomies were performed on the five patients with single perforations caused by blunt needles; three of these eyes have a visual acuity of counting fingers or worse. The two patients who had multiple posterior exit wounds required a total of four procedures. The visual acuity in these eyes is 20/400 and light perception. Anesthesia personnel should be well trained before attempting ocular anesthesia. The use of blunt needles does not prevent ocular penetration.\r"

Of the 23 cases of ocular penetration, 16 (70%) were from sharp (22-, 23-, and 25-gauge) needles, and 7 (30%) were from blunt (23- and 25-gauge) needles. Management options depended on the severity of the intraocular injury. Retinal breaks without retinal detachment were treated by laser photocoagulation (four cases) or cryopexy (one case) and were observed in three cases. More advanced complications (retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage) were usually treated by pars plana vitrectomy with or without a scleral buckle (12 of 14 cases). The final visual acuity was 20/400 or better in only 2 of the 14 retinal detachment cases. In cases without retinal detachment, the final visual acuity was 20/50 or better in 7 of 9 cases.\r"

For given spherocylindrical refractive errors and fixation distances, the cross-sectional area of Sturm's conoid at the retina was calculated for a schematic eye. These data were used to determine the optimal astigmatic error needed to obtain maximum depth of focus and least theoretical blur for any given spherical equivalent refractive error. Optimal depth of focus was obtained when the plus cylindrical component equaled negative sphere - 0.25 diopters. The near and distance visual acuities of ten pseudophakic patients with induced refractive errors were highly correlated with this model. Low myopic astigmatism after cataract surgery may represent an alternative to multifocal intraocular lenses by providing spectacle independence.\r"

Pupil size diminished with age and with increased illumination. Because of accommodative pupillary constriction, there was little difference in pupil size measured while reading in bright indoor illumination and distant viewing in indirect sunlight. Evaluating a patient's pupil size permits the individualized estimation of the eye's bifocal function following implantation of each of the annular-design bifocal IOLs.\r"

To determine the long-term efficacy of RALT, the authors reviewed case records of 44 patients (50 eyes) who received RALT for uncontrolled glaucoma at the Wills Eye Hospital before 1986. Success was defined as a 3 mmHg or greater decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) to less than 22 mmHg, and no further surgical intervention. By life table analysis, RALT was successful in 35% of eyes at 6 months, in 21% at 12 months, in 11% at 24 months, and in 5% at 48 months. Thirty-three percent of eyes in which primary ALT was successful for 1 year were successful 12 months after RALT. Complications included IOP spikes in 12%. In conclusion, RALT was generally not effective for long-term control of open-angle glaucoma, but may be useful as a temporizing measure. However, this use of RALT must be weighed against the risks of complications and the additional progression of disease before more definitive surgical intervention.\r"

All patients met reliability index criteria and recovered visual acuity of 20/25 or better. The effect of learning associated with repeated testing was controlled with visual fields of the fellow eye. Although a greater absolute threshold recovery occurred in the central region of the visual field after cataract extraction, the percent of threshold recovery did not vary across the visual field except for the most peripheral testing points, which demonstrated less recovery. Thus, cataracts depress an automated visual field fairly uniformly. Clinical grading of cataracts by a single experienced clinician was generally a poor predictor of visual field loss. Only the presence of posterior subcapsular plaque in the visual axis and the preoperative visual acuity correlated significantly with postoperative central threshold recovery. Pattern standard deviation remained unchanged after cataract removal, confirming it as a useful way of estimating visual loss from cataracts.\r"

  ".W": "The short-term additive effect and side effects of adding 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride to nonselective beta-blockers were investigated in 21 patients with ocular hypertension or early primary open-angle glaucoma. After a unilateral single dose application of topical 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride, intraocular pressure (IOP), heart rate, and interpalpebral distance were measured. The mean IOP of treated eyes showed a decline from a baseline of 20.0 +/- 3.0 mmHg to 18.1 +/- 3.2 mmHg at 1 hour (P less than 0.005), 16.5 +/- 2.6 mmHg at 2 hours (P less than 0.001), 15.2 +/- 2.5 mmHg at 3 hours (P less than 0.001), 18.5 +/- 3.0 mmHg at 12 hours (P = 0.02), and 19.2 +/- 2.9 mmHg at 24 hours (P = 0.2). No statistically significant change in the heart rate was seen. The interpalpebral distance of the treated eyes showed a significant increase (P less than 0.05) at all time intervals except 24 hours (P = 0.17). The authors conclude that 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride provides an additive pressure-lowering effect to nonselective beta-blockers for at least 12 hours after a single application, and shows promise as a useful adjunctive agent for short-term use in glaucoma therapy.\r"

After at least 2 weeks of twice daily timolol 0.5% therapy, PGF2 alpha-IE, 0.5 microgram in 30 microliters, was topically applied twice daily at 8 AM and 8 PM, 5 minutes before each timolol dose, for 7 days. Intraocular pressures were measured before timolol treatment, and at 8 AM, 8:30 AM, 12 PM, 2 PM, and 4 PM on the day before the addition of PGF2 alpha-IE, and on day 1 and on day 7 of combined therapy. Mean IOP was 39 +/- 2 mmHg (+/- standard error) before timolol therapy and 31 +/- 2 mmHg after at least 2 weeks of treatment with timolol alone. A significant (P = 0.004) further reduction of IOP was first observed 4 hours after the first dose of PGF2 alpha-IE, which was maintained throughout the duration of combined therapy. During the last day of combined treatment and at 12 hours after the final dose, IOP was reduced a mean of 6 to 9 mmHg (mean, 9.0 +/- 1.5 mmHg at 12 hours) below baseline values obtained with timolol alone. These results indicate that adding PGF2 alpha-IE in patients treated with timolol causes a further reduction of IOP that may prove to be clinically useful in glaucoma therapy.\r"

Patients were stratified as miotic treated or untreated and each group was randomized to receive either placebo (artificial tears) or apraclonidine in both eyes before instillation of tropicamide. In both the miotic treated and untreated groups that received placebo, there was a high incidence, (37% and 38%, respectively) of clinically significant (greater than or equal to 6 mmHg) intraocular pressure spikes after instillation of tropicamide. In both the miotic treated and untreated groups, there was a statistically significant difference in postcycloplegic intraocular pressure between the subgroup that received placebo and the group that received apraclonidine prophylaxis (P = 0.003 and P = 0.006, respectively). Additionally, four eyes that received placebo had a spike of over 10 mmHg (range, 12 to 27 mmHg), while only one eye had an increase of greater than 10 mmHg (12 mmHg) in the apraclonidine group. Thus, apraclonidine appears to be a useful agent for minimizing precipitous increases in intraocular pressure after cycloplegia in eyes of open-angle glaucoma patients prone to this complication of cycloplegia.\r"

Both mean arterial and venous calibers were significantly reduced (P less than 0.0001 for each), from 87.8 (+/- 14.2) and 128.3 (+/- 20.8) microns at high IOP to 82.0 (+/- 13.8) and 121.4 (+/- 18.5) microns at low IOP. Arterial and venous caliber decreases correlated positively with magnitude of IOP reduction (r = 0.503, P less than 0.01 and r = 0.555, P less than 0.001, respectively). While the IOP-dependent retinal arterial caliber change was highly significant in patients 55 years of age or younger (r = 0.636, P less than 0.01) and in the overall study group, it was not significant in patients older than 55 years (r = 0.205, P greater than 0.1). Age seems to be more influential than magnitude of IOP reduction in patients older than 55. Thus, diminished IOP-dependent retinal arterial caliber change in the elderly may be one factor contributing to the higher incidence and prevalence of glaucoma in this population.\r"

Eight eyes had nonneovascular mechanisms for the angle closure while two had neovascular angle closure. Treatment of eyes with this form of secondary angle closure included medical management alone, peripheral iridectomy, trabeculectomy, lensectomy, alloplastic tube shunt implantation, and cilioablative procedures. Three eyes required more than one of these treatments. The choice of therapy was based on the initial intraocular pressure and vision, degree of lens opacity and intumescence, presence of anterior segment neovascularization, and the gonioscopic appearance of the anterior chamber angle. The clinical features of this condition are described and a proposed mechanism and therapeutic approach are presented.\r"

Stage 5 retinal detachments were present in 94% (68 of 72) of the eyes with 65% (47 of 72) having a wide anterior and narrow posterior configuration. Anterior retinal loops were noted in 36% of the eyes. Subretinal opacities were present in 47% of the eyes. Choroidal thickening and intraocular calcium were noted in 22% and 14% of eyes, respectively. The axial eye length was measured and adjusted for the differences in chronological and gestational age and compared with data from normal eyes. This showed that eyes with ROP were much smaller. The standardized A-scan was helpful in confirming the diagnosis of retinal detachment, evaluating the peripheral retina, and examining the subretinal space. The combination of A-scan and B-scan echography is helpful in predicting anatomic findings in patients with ROP undergoing surgery.\r"

All eyes underwent vitrectomy, lensectomy, and membrane peeling and were found intraoperatively to have areas of retina that were attached (stage 4B). Preoperatively, a reproducible visual-evoked potential waveform appeared to better predict this retinal configuration and potential retinal function than did the contact B scan ultrasound of the globe. Postoperatively, seven (63.6%) eyes demonstrated an improvement in vision. Vitreous surgery may be beneficial in selected eyes of older patients with advanced ROP to clear media opacities and to uncover areas of functional, attached retina, which may allow these patients to more effectively use the vision they possess.\r"

Two of the children suffered direct head trauma in addition to being shaken; one patient was violently shaken without any physical or forensic evidence of direct head trauma. No direct ocular trauma was detected. In each case, the vitreous had partially separated from the retina but remained attached to the internal limiting membrane at the apices of the folds and the vitreous base, implicating traction in the pathogenesis of these folds. Although some intraocular findings in deliberately traumatized children may be explained by direct head injury, the possibility of both direct head trauma and shaking must be considered. Perimacular folds may develop without direct ocular or head trauma and may constitute evidence supporting violent shaking.\r"

Full crown preparations were made on six extracted maxillary teeth. The teeth were then forwarded to Dentsply International, York, Pa. Six castable glass crowns were fabricated to fit these teeth and returned to us. Subsequently the teeth were dried and the crowns were cemented. Scanning electron micrographs of the cemented crowns were made, and endodontic access openings were drilled. The teeth were also cold tested with standard methods. The teeth were then again subjected to scanning electron microscopy to determine any changes the crowns might have undergone. One crown cracked around the gingival collar as scanning electron microscopy was performed. The other crowns did not exhibit any problems such as cracking or crazing from either the access openings or the cold testing.\r"

Speed and inherent contrast were derived for each of the three films from sensitometric curves at six different temperatures and at five different processing times. The T-Mat G film (T-grain technology) was comparatively less sensitive than conventional films (X-Omat RP) to increases in processing temperature or time. Unlike dental intraoral films, which cannot be processed at low processing time or temperature, the light-sensitive films were of archival storage quality even at a low processing time of 2.5 minutes or at a low processing temperature of 21 degrees C. Therefore the processing time of an automatic processor may be decreased for light-sensitive films.\r"

During their annual physical examination, 1116 teenaged football players (567 black, 546 white) answered a 34-question survey and received an oral screening examination. Results indicated that 0.5% of nonusers, 1.5% of previous users, and 13% of current users had clinically evident oral leukoplakia. Factors statistically associated with higher leukoplakia rates included history of ST use, regular ST use, years of ST use, and the weekly quantity consumed. Factors not associated included use of alcohol, use of cigarettes, type of ST used, and hours of ST use. One brand of snuff was found to be associated with a relative risk of leukoplakia higher than that of another brand of snuff. Overall, in ST users oral leukoplakia was six times more likely to develop than in nonusers. Earlier ages of ST use may lead to greater periods of use (in years) and to possible increases in deleterious long-term health effects in current adolescents.\r"

SWSFR was significantly reduced in elderly subjects using one of these medications when compared with control subjects (0.94 vs 1.52 ml/min). Increasing use of up to four different xerostomia-inducing medications did not result in additional significant reduction of stimulated salivary flow rate. Psychotropic and diuretic agents were the most commonly used xerostomatic medications, and these were almost equally potent in reducing mean flow rate (0.79 vs 0.84 ml/min). The use of potentially xerostomatic medications did not affect decayed, missing, or filled surface scores or unstimulated whole saliva pH values. A weak, statistically significant, positive correlation (r = 0.39, p less than 0.01) was found between subject age and salivary flow rate in this population of elderly subjects, and this suggests that SWSRF is influenced more by factors such as medication than by aging.\r"

The cases were divided into 79 (85.9%) cysts and 13 (14.1%) neoplasms. The cysts occurred as four variants: (1) nonproliferative COC (35 cases), characterized by a simple unicystic structure; (2) proliferative COC (17 cases), characterized by a cystic structure with multiple daughter cysts, extensive ghost cell formations, and marked tendency for calcification; (3) ameloblastomatous COC (11 cases), characterized by ameloblastoma-like, cyst-lining epithelium with ghost cells and calcifications; and (4) COC associated with odontoma (16 cases), which combined features of COC and odontoma. The neoplasms occurred as three variants: (1) ameloblastoma ex COC (two cases), which showed unifocal and multifocal intraluminal and intramural ameloblastoma proliferating from the COC-lining epithelium; (2) peripheral epithelial odontogenic ghost cell tumor (eight cases), which occurred in the gingiva and resembled peripheral ameloblastoma except for clustered ghost cells in the central portion of epithelial islands and the presence of juxtaepithelial dentinoid; and (3) central epithelial odontogenic ghost cell tumor (three cases). The latter showed ameloblastomatous or adenomatoid odontogenic tumor-like epithelial clusters with ghost cell formation and juxtaepithelial dentinoid. The clinical features of cystic and neoplastic variants were tabulated and described. On the basis of histopathologic features and their immunohistochemical reaction to polyclonal antikeratin antibody, it is suggested that ghost cells might be the result of coagulative necrosis.\r"

Four formalin-fixed specimens were processed for electron microscopy, and for immunohistochemical staining with antiactin, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein, and OKT6 (CD1) with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. Tumor cells contained many primary lysosomes, autophagic vacuoles, and phagocytic vacuoles. The phagocytic vacuoles appeared to contain collagen fibrils. Tumor cells stained positive with antiactin and OKT6 (CD1), and negative with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein. The results indicate that tumor cells are actively phagocytic and suggest that tumor cells might arise from Langerhans' cells.\r"

The amount of odontogenic epithelium varies considerably and consists usually of small islands or strands, although larger follicles are sometimes present. In one case the epithelial cells had a clear cytoplasm, whereas in another it was granular and eosinophilic. Origin from the surface oral mucosa can sometimes be seen. The connective tissue component is usually cellular, but collagenous, myxomatous, and mixed forms occur. Calcifications were present in 22 cases and consisted of tissue interpreted as either dentinoid, cementum, bone, or dystrophic calcific material.\r"

  ".W": "During orthodontic treatment to promote eruption of maxillary and mandibular second bicuspids, a young male patient had a severe endodontic cellulitis of a mandibular bicuspid. Apexogenesis and resolution of the periapical lesion was achieved by infection control with nonspecific intracanal medication without calcium hydroxide, as stated by Das. A mild periodontal cellulitis occurred shortly thereafter and rapidly resolved. A second endodontic cellulitis, after apexogenesis without an endodontic seal, occurred shortly after completion of orthodontic treatment. This also quickly resolved, and the canal was effectively sealed. This case indicates the importance of an effective endodontic seal shortly after apexogenesis is induced by infection control. This report and others on the subject indicate that apexogenesis of nonvital permanent immature teeth by infection control is a predictable endodontic treatment procedure.\r"

Urines were collected within 1 hour, from 1 to 3 hours, at 24 hours and at 3, 6 and 9 days after vaccine administration and reactions were quantitated from 0 to 3+. In contrast to previous studies in older children which showed little or no antigenuria following HbOC vaccination, our study shows that in infants intense Hib antigenuria is evident within 2 to 3 hours and persists 3 days after vaccine administration and that less intense antigenuria may be detected in some infants for several days. With efficacious vaccines now being used in 2- to 6-month-old infants, invasive Hib disease may soon be limited to infants of this age just before their seroconversion. It should be recognized that antigenuria occurs for several days after vaccination with Hib conjugate vaccines and that it could be erroneously interpreted as evidence of invasive Hib infection.\r"

Diphtheria-tetanus toxoid vaccine was concurrently injected at another site. Two dosages, 7.5 and 15 micrograms, of Hib CPS were studied. No serious reactions occurred. Hib-TT elicited fewer local reactions than diphtheria-tetanus toxoid vaccine. Significant increases in Hib CPS serum antibodies occurred after all injections in both dosage groups with virtually no differences between the two groups. After the first and second injections geometric mean serum antibody concentrations of both dosage groups combined increased to 0.49 and 3.71 micrograms/ml and 81 and 99% of the vaccinees, respectively, had concentrations greater than 0.15 micrograms/ml. After the third dose geometric mean concentrations increased to 13.7 micrograms/ml and all had concentrations greater than 0.15 micrograms/ml. The geometric mean Hib CPS antibody concentrations decreased to 1.24 micrograms/ml 18 months after the third injection, but 97% still had concentrations greater than 0.15 micrograms/ml. The rise of Hib CPS antibodies was mostly in the IgG class. The most pronounced increase was seen in the IgG1 subclass but there were also increase in IgG2 and IgG3. Protective concentrations of TT antibodies were found in all postimmunization sera. In conclusion Hib-TT is safe and immunogenic in infants and should be protective from 6 to 30 months and probably longer thereafter.\r"

Patients in two rooms were followed during the cold seasons by sampling aspirates every other day during the child's entire hospital stay. Clinical features were recorded daily. Indirect monoclonal immunofluorescent assay and isolation in HEp-2 were used for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) diagnosis. The mean RSV detection rate was 39% at the time of admission, ranging from 8% in April, 1989, to 62% in July, 1988. During the cold months 43 of 288 (15%) nosocomial RSV cases were detected. Pneumonia and wheezing bronchitis were the principal diagnoses of both groups admitted, whether they were shedding RSV or not. It is concluded that RSV plays a major role in admissions for acute respiratory infections, as well as in nosocomial infections, in Santiago. Because clinical features do not allow one to differentiate viral from bacterial acute respiratory infections, the importance of rapid viral diagnosis is emphasized.\r"

Herpes zoster also occurred in 2 of 14 children. No case of chickenpox was severe or associated with complications. General studies of immunoglobulins, specific antibodies to immunization agents, complement and lymphocyte subpopulation number and function indicated that 1 of 14 had low serum IgA and 3 of 14 lacked antibody to 1 (n = 2) or 2 (n = 1) immunization agents. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific immune studies showed that the children developed VZV-antibody titers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of 1:640 to 1:10 240. By immunoblot assay all appeared to develop a normal spectrum of antibodies to individual VZV proteins. All but one developed VZV cellular immune responses with stimulation indices ranging from 3.6 to 174. Sequential follow-up of 8 patients revealed 1 who became seronegative and 2 who lost VZV cell-mediated immune responses. Chickenpox may recur more frequently than is generally recognized. General and VZV-specific immune investigations are unlikely to indicate a reason.\r"

Thirty-five percent of children between 6 months and 5 years of age were not fully immunized; 3 infants died. Approximately 50% of infected children between 5 and 14 years of age had not received 5 doses of pertussis vaccine. Of the 413 physician respondents to a questionnaire, fully 10% do not administer pertussis vaccine to preschool children because of parental, personal or other reasons. We hypothesize that the reservoir of pertussis-susceptible older children and young adults is augmented by this omission of the fifth diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-pertussis vaccine. Newer educational and vaccine strategies are necessary to prevent epidemics of pertussis.\r"

All the children were subjected to culture of the nasopharynx and the eyes. H. influenzae was carried in the nasopharynx of 53% of the children (range between day care centers, 20 to 91%). Of the 20 children with acute conjunctivitis 8 had eye cultures positive for H. influenzae, 2 had Moraxella and the remaining were culture-negative. Ten colonies of H. influenzae were isolated from each positive culture and identified by capsular type, biotype and multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis. All but one of the isolates were nonencapsulated. They belonged to 4 biotypes and 8 electrophoretic types. The same strain was recovered from the eyes and nasopharynx of the symptomatic children, suggesting that the H. influenzae in the eyes originated from the nasopharynx. There was no evidence for spread of the same H. influenzae strains between day-care centers. Even within each center the Haemophilus strains recovered from the eyes varied among the symptomatic children. The in vitro capacity to attach to oropharyngeal epithelial cells was not increased among the H. influenzae recovered from the eyes. The results question if the majority of conjunctivitis cases were caused by H. influenzae and suggested that eyes were colonized with the nasopharyngeal carrier strain rather than infected by an isolate with special virulence for the eye.\r"

Based on the DNA restriction endonuclease pattern of each isolate, the rate of infection for children differed significantly (P less than 0.001) among centers: at Center 1, 50% (46 of 93) of children acquired cytomegalovirus in day care; at Center 2, 62% (64 of 104); and at Center 3, 25% (21 of 84). Infection rates were associated with the number of infants enrolled, and half or more of infected children were younger than 24 months of age. Six of 7 new isolates were introduced by children 18 months of age. Based on DNA patterns the prevalent isolates at Centers 1 and 2, although different, were shed for an average of 22 and 23 months, respectively, compared with an average of 15 months for other isolates (P less than 0.001). Reinfections with the prevalent isolates were observed for 2 of 34 children tested. The most important factors affecting day-care center transmission are the number of infants enrolled and prolonged viral shedding, possibly enhanced by reinfection.\r"

Of 46 seronegative mothers without infected children, 2 seroconverted. Among 50 mothers with infected children, 19 seroconverted and of these 19, 9 shed cytomegalovirus and all 9 shed the same isolate as their child. The annual seroconversion rate for these women was 30%, significantly higher than the 3% rate for mothers without infected children (P less than 0.001; relative risk, 10.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.4, 43.8). Maternal infection was not associated with maternal age, race, duration of observation, duration of viral shedding by their children or the DNA pattern of each isolate but was associated with the age when a child's infection was identified. Only 3 of the 19 mothers who seroconverted had children older than 20 months of age (26, 28 and 28 months). Sixteen (57%) of 28 mothers with infected children 20 months of age or younger became infected compared with only 3 (13%) of 22 mothers with infected children more than 20 months (P less than 0.007), Fisher's exact test, two tailed; relative risk, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3, 11.8). For mothers with infected children younger than 20 months of age the interval between identification of her child's infection and maternal infection ranged from 1 to 26 months (8 +/- 6 (SD) months). Survival estimates revealed that mothers of infected children younger than 20 months of age acquired cytomegalovirus significantly more rapidly than mothers of older children (chi square, 9.34; P less than 0.0022).\r"

Socially, the incidence of depressive illness in the general population is three times that of schizophrenia. The cost of depression in terms of lost days at work and treatment is estimated to be $29 billion in 1991. Diagnosing and treating depressive illnesses depend on the clinical manifestations of the illness and the assessment skills of the practitioner. Different treatment modalities such as psychotherapy, psychopharmacology, and electroconvulsive treatments can be effective singularly or in combination to assist the patient in regaining his or her functionality in daily life.\r"

  ".W": "Recent years have witnessed accumulating evidence that the disorders subsumed under the heading of childhood depression are much more prevalent than used to be believed; that these conditions in prepubertal youngsters are more similar to those disorders occurring in adolescents and adults than was previously believed; that childhood depression can co-exist with many other childhood conditions; and that, although a rare occurrence, suicide is committed by older children. To quote a professional in the child mental health field: It is difficult to see how depression could not be involved in almost every form of psychopathology. The various theories of personality speculate on the existence of unhappy and depressing feelings and cognitions at the core of human development, with ineffective means of dealing with these concerns expressed by abnormalities. . . . Thus it becomes reasonable to argue that depression is everywhere in childhood and adulthood and hence we must be careful to specify under what conditions it is to be regarded as pathological.\r"

  ".W": "The phenomenon of adolescent depression combines depressive symptoms with adolescent developmental variables and contextual factors, such as family patterns, ethnic background, socioeconomic status, gender, biologic factors, and individual experience with personal loss. These developmental and contextual factors lead to specific adolescent manifestations of depression, such as academic problems, sexual activity, substance abuse, conduct disorders, pain, eating disorders, and the potential for suicide. Assessment of the depressed adolescent includes specific questions concerning these possible manifestations and problem behaviors. Thorough assessment always includes questioning about the possibility and lethality of suicidal ideation. Modes of treatment include counseling, various forms of individual and group psychotherapy, environmental manipulation, and use of psychopharmacologic agents. Follow-up care is essential for the prevention or early treatment of future depressive episodes. The ultimate goal of care of the depressed adolescent is to prevent suicide and to minimize disruption of the adolescent developmental process.\r"

  ".W": "Accumulating evidence suggests that cognitive processes or stimuli associated with a stressor may influence the neurochemical state. In addition, it has been suggested that a person's coping responses may protect him or her from the biologic dysregulations implicated in depression. From a nursing care perspective, the proposed model suggests the following practice components. First, assessment not only should include the symptom profiles of each client but should address both physical and psychosocial stressors. Second, once identified, individualized care needs to incorporate a variety of interventions that focuses on the target components (i.e., cognitive interventions for negative thought patterns, interventions to build interpersonal skills, sleep hygiene principles, pharmacologic interventions, and so forth). Finally, one needs to address how having experienced episodes of depression may influence the client's self-perception and ongoing quality of life. Nurses must begin to understand how the experience of having a depressive episode itself may serve as an ongoing stressor for the client. The factors that maintain depressive behavior and influence recurrence need to be the central focus of mental health nursing from a research and clinical perspective. It is this attention to integration and recurrence that will define nursing's unique contributions to this important area of mental health.\r"

  ".W": "Major depression and clinically significant depressive symptoms occur commonly in the community-dwelling, medically ill, and institutionalized elderly. Both major depression and depressive symptoms need thorough evaluation and treatment because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with these syndromes. Depression may be difficult to diagnose, especially in the medically ill elderly, because of the masking of depressive symptoms by somatic complaints or the presumption that symptoms are attributable to concurrent medical illness. Therefore, the clinician must be alert to the possibility of depression in the elderly patient. Although no specific diagnostic test is available, rating scales can be useful in screening for depression in the elderly patient. It is necessary to rule out medical illness or medications as contributing factors to depression. Psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, alone or in combination, are effective treatments for most elderly patients with depression. ECT is a safe and effective treatment for major depression in this population. Depression in the elderly is potentially a chronic and relapsing illness with significant associated medical and social morbidity. Because of their frequent contact with the elderly, nurses play a particularly important role in the diagnosis and treatment of depression. They need to recognize typical and atypical symptoms of depression and must be familiar with the potential side effects of antidepressant treatment. Close monitoring for these potential side effects can minimize disability. By working as a team with physicians, psychologists, and others, nurses have a necessary role in the care of the elderly depressed patient.\r"

  ".W": "Depression in young women occurs at a rate twice that of men. Physiologic, psychological, and social phenomena contribute to the development of this multifactorial disorder that interferes with the productivity of women at the height of their work and family careers. Neuroendocrine factors, both menstrually linked and independent of menstrual functioning, have been implicated in gender-biased distribution of affective disorder. Equally salient for women are environmental and cognitive factors that contribute to loss of hope and a sense of helplessness in managing day-to-day responsibilities. Social discrimination and the social roles performed by women may expose them to more stresses or those that are not easily managed. Each of these factors may leave women more vulnerable to the onset of affective disorder. Despite this, there is much nurses can do in the prevention and treatment of depression using a biopsychosocial strategic approach. Psychoeducation, physiologic assessment and intervention, and a maintained caring interaction with the client can promote a return to normal mood and effective functioning for most women with affective illness.\r"

Nortriptyline, imipramine, and desipramine have demonstrated the highest correlation between clinical response and plasma concentration. MAO inhibitors are useful but require a reliable patient who can comply with dietary restrictions. Maprotiline and amoxapine are not first- or second-line antidepressants. Clomipramine and fluoxetine offer unique properties that make them first- or second-line antidepressants for particular patients.

  ".U": "91367735\r", 
  ".W": "Nurses providing care for individuals with eating disorders should identify and test the effectiveness of various milieu factors and nursing therapeutics employed in the treatment of these often-debilitating disorders. Nurses offer presence, role modeling, surveillance, and emotional and physiologic support while guiding reluctant patients to explore and experiment with new behaviors. Nurses provide flexibility, empathy, and rational limit setting in response to the unique and shifting needs of each patient. This interpersonal dynamic is often extremely different from that experienced in the patient's family of origin and, thus, contributes to the essential \"interpersonal conditions\" that are necessary for the patient to engage meaningfully in treatment. The prevalence of eating disorders suggests that nurses are likely to encounter people with eating disorders in many settings. Nurses should be skilled at spotting disordered eating among an array of clinical presentations (e.g., amenorrhea, disturbed family relationships, athletic injuries) because people engaged in disordered eating are hesitant to volunteer such information. In addition to the shame associated with disordered eating is the stigma associated with psychiatric treatment. Seeking help from a nurse may be perceived as less stigmatizing than seeking care from a psychiatrist. Thus, nurses may serve as important points of entry for the hesitant patient. The initial contact is so essential in setting the stage for the continuation and denouement of therapy. Finally, nurses and patients with disordered eating share at least one commonality. Both groups are predominantly women. The prevailing culture has been implicated repeatedly as a major factor in contributing to the prevalence of disordered eating. Nurses experience the influences of paternalism in their professional practice and confront daily the pressures of socially constructed feminine ideals. These gender-sensitive ways of knowing, which nurses bring to the treatment relationship, should be further analyzed as substantive dimensions with treatment and preventive potential.\r"

Often health care providers have difficulty with the addiction model of treatment, even though many eating-disordered patients will attest to the assistance and support they receive from these programs. It will be useful for both health care professionals and 12-step programs to avoid taking competitive positions. It is far more useful for professionals to have a working knowledge of how these programs work and how they can be of use to the individuals with eating disorders. Knowledge of local resources will also be of great value. Given the assistance that the clients tell us they receive at these programs, it makes more sense to understand and use these programs more, not less. There is evidence that eating disorder behaviors are addictive behavior, both from a psychological and physiologic perspective. Use of a 12-step program will assist with the practical details of helping individuals to stop employing self-destructive behaviors as well as provide support and decrease feelings of isolation and depression. It is important to integrate the 12-step program components into an overall treatment program to make the best use of both programs and decrease the competition usually inherent in both programs.\r"

A positive feeding relationship is a concrete measure parents can be taught to provide for the child's healthy psychosocial development. Although the development of eating disorders is complex and caused by a multiplicity of factors, community-wide education by nurses about nutrition and feeding at successive developmental levels from infancy to old age can decrease the incidence of eating disorders in the community.

Caregivers must be taught how to cope with the patient's denial and how to modify the patient's environment so that it is safe and easy to understand. Pharmacologic therapy for depression accompanying dementia can improve a patient's quality of life and independence considerably; drugs may also be of help in dealing with patients who resist care. Psychotic symptoms usually do not require pharmacologic treatment, and hypnotics should, if possible, be avoided as a solution to sleep problems.\r"

The precision of this technique was evaluated by comparing predicted transfer RNA loop and RNA pseudoknot structures with known or consensus structures.

The sequence of the complementary DNA encoding pp40 revealed similarity to the gene encoding MAD-3, a protein with mammalian I kappa B-like activity. Protein sequencing of I kappa B purified from rabbit lung confirmed that MAD-3 encodes a protein similar to I kappa B. The sequence similarity between MAD-3 and pp40 includes a casein kinase II and consensus tyrosine phosphorylation site, as well as five repeats of a sequence found in the human erythrocyte protein ankyrin.

A complementary DNA encoding the IL-8 receptor from human neutrophils has now been isolated. The amino acid sequence shows that the receptor is a member of the superfamily of receptors that couple to guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). The sequence is 29% identical to that of receptors for the other neutrophil chemoattractants, fMet-Leu-Phe and C5a. Mammalian cells transfected with the IL-8 receptor cDNA clone bind IL-8 with high affinity and respond specifically to IL-8 by transiently mobilizing calcium. The IL-8 receptor may be part of a subfamily of related G protein-coupled receptors that transduce signals for the IL-8 family of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\r"

A cDNA clone from HL-60 neutrophils, designated p2, has now been isolated that encodes a human IL-8 receptor. When p2 is expressed in oocytes from Xenopus laevis, the oocytes bind 125I-labeled IL-8 specifically and respond to IL-8 by mobilizing calcium stores with an EC50 of 20 nM. This IL-8 receptor has 77% amino acid identity with a second human neutrophil receptor isotype that binds IL-8 with higher affinity. It also exhibits 69% amino acid identity with a protein reported to be an N-formyl peptide receptor from rabbit neutrophils, but less than 30% identity with all other known G protein-coupled receptors, including the human N-formyl peptide receptor.\r"

In contrast, intracerebral injection of less than 10(3) CTL caused disease and death when viral antigens were expressed on leptomeningeal and choroid plexus cells of the nervous system. The neuronal cell line OBL21 expresses little or no major histocompatibility (MHC) class I surface glycoproteins and when infected with LCMV, resisted lysis by virus-specific CTLs. Expression of MHC heavy chain messenger RNA was limited, but beta 2-microglobulin messenger RNA and protein was made normally. OBL21 cells were made sensitive to CTL lysis by transfection with a fusion gene encoding another MHC class I molecule. Hence, neuronal cells probably evade immune surveillance by failing to express MHC class I molecules.\r"

The decrease in the sodium current was accompanied by a 10- to 15-millivolt shift in the steady-state availability of the sodium channel toward more negative potentials and was inhibited by guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) or pertussis toxin, suggesting that the extracellular modulation of the sodium channel by cAMP is mediated by a membrane-delimited mechanism that includes a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein.\r"

Prolonged, potent reduction of acid secretion using omeprazole has resulted in significant therapeutic advantage over existing antisecretory medication, such as H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs). Research experience with lansoprazole indicates that it has treatment properties for acid-related disease that are similar to those of omeprazole. Omeprazole has been used successfully in the treatment of reflux esophagitis and the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in the United States over the past year and has received approval recently as first-line therapy for duodenal ulcer disease. Research involving more than 20,000 individuals, postmarketing surveillance studies, and thorough safety studies in man and animals have shown omeprazole to be well tolerated, with an incidence and spectrum of adverse events in clinical trials similar to those observed with H2RAs.\r"

In addition, a brief questionnaire was administered to document demographics and risk behavior. Of the 265 workers aged 16 and older in 15 migrant camps, 198 (75%) consented to the survey and testing. Of the 198 tested, 85% were male and 75% single. The median age was 39, with a range of 16 to 69 years. Twenty-five (13%) were HIV antibody positive, and 32 (16%) had reactive serologic tests for syphilis. Of the 166 workers who reported the frequency of condom use, 77 (46%) indicated they never use condoms. We conclude that there is a relatively high rate of HIV infection in these rural South Carolina migrant workers, whose behavior puts them at risk for HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases.\r"

The male-female ratio was 3.7:1, and the highest rates of disease were found in the age groups 5 to 14, 35 to 44, and 55 to 74. Ticks were most frequently implicated as the source of infection (84/154 [55%]), followed by rabbits, (58/154 [38%]). Seventy percent of the patients were hospitalized, and four (2.5%) died. The annual number of patients who reported that rabbits were their probable source of exposure to Francisella tularensis and the estimated number of rabbits harvested (ie, killed by hunters) for the year correlated closely with the total number of cases reported from year to year.\r"

Despite efforts to salvage the most distal tissue possible, 8 of 12 extremities amputated in the acute traumatic period required revision to a more proximal level.

In the morning a volume of 1.7 Gy was given to an area that encompassed the entire tumor, enlarged lymph nodes, and all areas at risk for microscopic disease. Six hours later, 1.1 Gy was given to an area that included only the tumor and any enlarged lymph nodes, with a 2-cm margin. The treatment was well tolerated; of the 13 patients who completed therapy, six did not require a break in therapy, and seven patients did. The median rest period was 2 days. There was no grade 4 toxicity. Grade 3 toxicity included skin changes (one case), mucositis (two), dysphagia (two), weight loss (three), and a decrease in the hemoglobin level (one case). The response rate in the 13 who completed therapy was 13/13 (100%); 11 of the 13 (83%) had a complete response. Only one of the 11 who achieved a complete response had failure at the primary site. At a median follow-up of 24 months, the absolute survival was 7/13 (54%) and the corrected survival was 7/10 (70%). This technique permits radiation therapy to be given on an accelerated schedule without a planned break in treatment. The overall response rate and survival at 2 years was excellent.\r"

Unfortunately, the shift from radiotherapy to chemotherapy has not produced a discernible improvement in patient survival. Retrospective and prospective data suggest that whole-abdomen irradiation offers curative potential in patients with nonbulky residual disease after surgical cytoreduction. Its use should therefore be reconsidered as a primary adjuvant therapy in properly selected patients.\r"

Sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for medial meniscus (MM) tears, lateral meniscus (LM) tears, and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears were either obtained or calculated from data contained in each article. The medians of measurements for MM tears were 97% SN, 89% SP, 88% PPV, and 96% NPV. Measurement medians for LM tears were 85% SN, 94% SP, 86% PPV, and 95% NPV. ACL tear measurement medians were 100% SN, 96% SP, 80% PPV, and 98% NPV. High NPVs were found in several studies, many of which were 100%. The high NPV of MR imaging suggests that diagnostic arthroscopic surgery is not necessary in the evaluation of patients with negative MRI studies. The superior sensitivity of MRI in detecting frank posterior horn tears, intrasubstance meniscal tears, and significant incidental findings also suggests that screening MRI scans can facilitate preoperative planning.\r"

The median survival time after diagnosis was 9 weeks following steroids and 7 weeks after biopsy and steroids. Cytoreductive surgery and radiotherapy improved median survival time by a maximum of 16 weeks, but there was significant morbidity in some patients undergoing craniotomy. Although 92% of the biopsied lesions were either glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma, the median survival of these patients was similar to the 8% of patients confirmed as having intermediate grade astrocytoma. Patients presenting with minimal functional deficit (WHO grade I or II) had longer median survival times than those presenting in poor condition (WHO grade III or IV). In this series there was no relationship between management undertaken and clinical status of the patient. The 9% of the cohort that survived 1 year were treated in a variety of ways. This audit, together with results from other studies, suggests that a prospective clinical trial of different management regimes in elderly patients with supratentorial gliomas is needed. Since median survival time in the most intensively treated patients will be around 6 months, treatment evaluation must consider the quality of life provided.\r"

All patients underwent aneurysmal clipping within 48 hours after SAH. Postoperatively, TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, Cataclot [sodium (E)-3-[p-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)phenyl]-2-propenoate] was administered to 13 patients by continuous drip infusion at a dose of 1 microgram/kg/min for 8 to 14 days (group A). The remaining 11 patients did not receive this drug (group B). Of the 13 patients in group A, seven patients (54%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm after SAH. Four patients (31%) developed a transient deterioration of consciousness and/or motor disturbance. Three of these patients fully recovered, while one of them showed a mild neurological deficit on discharge. One patient (8%) developed permanent dysphasia and hemiparesis as a result of ischemic brain damage due to vasospasm. One patient (8%) died of the side effect. On the other hand, of the 11 patients in group B, only three (27%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm. One (9%) patient presented a transient neurological deficit but fully recovered upon discharge. Four patients (36%) showed permanent neurological deficits, although they all could lead an independent life after discharge. The three remaining patients developed a severe disturbance of consciousness caused by ischemia due to vasospasm, and two of them died within 1 month after the onset of SAH. In the group treated with Cataclot, two patients developed an epidural hematoma late during the administration of the drug. Of these two, one patient died of increased intracranial pressure that was accelerated by the complication. These results indicate that TXA2 synthetase inhibitor is effective in not only decreasing the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm but also reducing the neurological deterioration due to vasospasm after SAH. However, this drug has a hazardous side effect in that it may promote a tendency to bleed, which caused death in one of our patients.\r"

Cerebral angiography demonstrated a direct CCF associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm at the C2 portion. Transarterial balloon embolization of the CCF caused severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. A CCF with an intradural pseudoaneurysm is life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. However, balloon occlusion in such cases is contraindicated because of possible rupture of a pseudoaneurysm. Trapping or a direct surgical approach is the treatment of choice.\r"

Study of the tumor tissue showed diffuse infiltration of the entire pituitary gland by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the majority of the infiltrating lymphocytes were T cells that might have modulated the immunoreaction to the anterior pituitary gland. We suggest that the disorder is related to cell-mediated immunity as well as humoral immunity.\r"

Twenty-two had unruptured aneurysms (35%), 15 were grade I (24%), 16 grade II (25%), five grade III (8%), and four grade IV (7%). The aneurysms were mainly located in the middle cerebral artery (29 patients) and the anterior communicating artery (13 patients). Eleven of our 62 patients (17%) developed a new, persistent postoperative deficit. However, in only one case (2%) was temporary clipping felt to be implicated in the development of the deficit. In three other patients (5%), the effect of temporary clipping, although unlikely, could not be excluded. Overall, 92% of our patients with temporary clipping had good to excellent outcome, with 3% mortality and 5% morbidity. We believe that temporary clipping is a safe procedure that contributes significantly to a better outcome.\r"

The 138 patients were classified into three age groups: 59 years or younger (group A: 73 cases), 60 to 69 years (group B: 37 cases), and 70 years or older (group C: 28 cases). Severity of both the subarachnoid hemorrhages on computed tomography scan and the angiographic vasospasms was graded. The angiographic vasospasms were analyzed at the internal carotid artery, M1 segments of the middle cerebral artery, and A2 segments of the anterior cerebral. In all the relationships among the subarachnoid hemorrhage grades, the Hounsfield numbers, and the operative approaches to the angiographic vasospasm grade, there was a tendency for the angiographic vasospasm grades to be lower with increasing age in both the internal carotid artery and the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery. This tendency was more apparent in the larger vessels, that is, the internal carotid arteries. Close correlations of the angiographic vasospasm grades to the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and to low-density area on computed tomography scan were found in both the M1 and A2 territories in the three groups. However, there were no significant differences among the three groups in the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and low-density area on computed tomography scan. Regarding the surgical outcome, the older the patients, the higher were the mortality rates: 8% in group A, 11% in group B, and 25% in group C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During the 10-year period from 1979 to 1989, there were 22 patients with 24 aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. All 24 aneurysms were unruptured. They represented 3% of all intracranial aneurysms and 11% of all internal carotid artery aneurysms diagnosed at the hospital during the 10-year period. Eighteen patients were women and 4 were men. Their ages ranged from 34 to 82 years (mean 63.3 years). Of the 22 patients, 12 (55%) had multiple aneurysms. A follow-up study without treatment was made in 15 of the 22 patients who had a total of 16 unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. This study excluded 7 of the 22 patients with a total of eight aneurysms because of operation or death soon after diagnosis. The average maximal dimension of the 16 aneurysms was 5 mm, with a range of 2-17 mm. Follow-up periods varied from 11 months to 10.5 years, with an average of 4.7 years. During this period, none of the 16 aneurysms ruptured, and they remained asymptomatic, except for one aneurysm that had been discovered as a result of the cavernous sinus syndrome. Some surgeons are now attempting direct operations on intracavernous carotid artery aneurysms, even if the aneurysms are unruptured and relatively small.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a prospective randomized trial, white cell (WBC)-reduced blood components were compared to standard platelet and red cell concentrates with respect to alloimmunization, refractoriness, and platelet increments after transfusion. Sixteen of 31 adult acute leukemia patients received only WBC-reduced platelet concentrates (PCs) and red cells (RBCs), with fewer than 10(6) WBCs per unit. Fifteen control patients received standard blood components with a mean of 0.1 x 10(9) (PCs) and 1 x 10(9) (RBCs) WBCs per unit. Platelet loss during cotton-wool filtration averaged 14 percent (range, 3-32%) from fresh PCs and 24 percent (range, 9-62%) from stored PCs. Filtration did not change corrected increments (CI) measured after transfusion of fresh PCs. The Cl 1 hour after filtration of stored PCs diminished by 27 percent, but the difference was smaller after 18 hours, which suggests better survival of WBC-reduced platelets. The number of platelet units transfused did not differ in the two groups. No patient in the WBC-reduced group developed permanent platelet refractoriness; transient HLA antibodies of low titer developed in two patients. In the control group, one patient became refractory because of immunization and two developed transient HLA antibodies. It can be concluded that the reduction of WBCs in blood components can effectively prevent alloimmunization.\r"

Subsequently, 24 patients became alloimmunized; all of their antibodies were of HLA specificity. Eighty-two single-donor platelet transfusions were given, and the clinical responses were considered satisfactory if the 18-hour corrected count increment was 7.5 x 10(3) per microL or higher. In the meantime, 82 pairs of patient sera and donor lymphocytes were crossmatched. Among 63 crossmatched transfusions, 53 (84%) resulted in a satisfactory increment, with a mean (+/- SEM) of 17.71 +/- 1.96 (x 10(3)/microL), and 10 did not result in a satisfactory increment. The increments after 19 unmatched transfusions and 25 random-donor (uncrossmatched) transfusions were 0.7 +/- 0.3 and 2.39 +/- 0.66, respectively. The difference was not significant (p greater than 0.05). The agreement between the LCT results and clinical response was 88 percent. Retrospectively, the corrected count increments showed no significant differences (p greater than 0.05) among three groups of HLA grading: the increments for A/BU/BX, C/D, and random HLA matches were 22.97 +/- 4.07, 15.1 +/- 1.97, and 14.85 +/- 2.04, respectively. These results suggest that platelet crossmatching by LCT is an effective method for use in alloimmunized patients, especially Chinese patients.\r"

  ".W": "In spite of growing awareness of the potential risks associated with transfusion, the number of platelet units transfused in the United States continues to increase each year. There is a growing interest in ensuring that all transfusions are administered for appropriate reasons. Prospective review of requests for transfusions has been used to accomplish this goal. Although successful in reducing the number of inappropriate transfusions, this review method requires great time commitments by blood bank personnel and physicians. A knowledge-based system (ESPRE) that aids hospital blood bank personnel in the review of requests for platelet transfusions has been developed. The system automatically obtains most of the required patient data via a direct link to the hospital's main laboratory computers. The system generates a printed report that includes a list of patient-specific data, a list of the conditions for which a transfusion would be appropriate for the particular patient (given the clinical condition), and the conclusions drawn by the system. During a preliminary clinical evaluation of ESPRE, 73 randomly selected platelet transfusion requests were evaluated for approval by laboratory personnel and ESPRE. Overall, ESPRE would have approved 71 of the requests and laboratory staff would have approved 72. Forty-four percent of the requests would have been approved for the same reasons given by the staff. There were only three disagreements on final approval between ESPRE and blood bank personnel. This computerized expert system is a promising approach to the prospective review of all platelet transfusions.\r"

Synthetic A and B trisaccharide-bovine serum albumin glycoconjugates were used for coating and monoclonal antibodies for the detection of heavy chain isotypes. Hemagglutination titers were determined in addition. Blood donors were between 20 and 67 years old, and at least 10 sera per 10-year age category and ABO blood group were included in this study. Antibody concentrations were expressed as a percentage of an internal standard, and sera with subclass-restricted anti-A and/or anti-B (anti-A/B) responses were used to normalize the ELISA values of IgG subclasses. A good correlation between the sum of the four subclasses and the total anti-A/B IgG values (rs = 0.81 for anti-A and 0.84 for anti-B) was obtained. IgG1 and IgG2 were the most predominant subclasses, but were found in various proportions in different individuals. Donor-to-donor variation exceeded age-related changes for all measured parameters. The correlation of anti-A IgM, IgG, IgA, and their sum with the agglutination titers was significant and revealed rs values of 0.70, 0.65, 0.65, and 0.80, respectively. For anti-B as well, the correlation of ELISA values with the agglutination titer was best when all three isotypes were added. We conclude that anti-A/B IgA, together with IgM and IgG, substantially contributes to the agglutination reaction. Potentially autoreactive antibodies were detected in sera of blood groups A, B, and AB.\r"

Two anti-HCV enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits and one recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) were used to test serum samples of 1476 donations from 692 autologous blood donors to assess the prevalence of anti-HCV and its relationship to transfusion history. Of all autologous blood donations, 23 (1.6%) reacted when tested with one EIA kit and 29 (2.0%) reacted when tested by the other EIA kit. Of the autologous donors, 12 (1.78%) reacted by the first EIA kit and 14 (2.02%) by the second. Discrepancies in the EIA results from different donations by the same donor were seen in seven donors. The RIBA was positive or indeterminate in 33 percent of the EIA-reactive donations and in 41 percent of EIA-reactive donors. All RIBA-positive and -indeterminate samples reacted with both EIA kits. There was no significant difference in the EIA-reactive rates of autologous and first-time homologous blood donors. Previously transfused autologous blood donors had a higher anti-HCV EIA-reactive rate than nontransfused autologous donors, but the difference was not significant. In regard to hepatitis C, the use of autologous blood for homologous transfusion appears to be as safe as the use of blood from first-time homologous donors. Universal testing of previously transfused patients for hepatitis C appears premature at this time. Discrepant anti-HCV EIA results from different donations from the same individual have implications regarding donor deferral.\r"

The present study was conducted to help document the need for these changes. Incomplete expression of the A antigen in neonatal patients can contribute to the accumulation of unabsorbed maternal anti-A that is capable of mediating the immune destruction of transfused adult RBCs. Sera from 50 group A neonatal infants of group O mothers were tested for anti-A by using RBC segments of A1 and A2 units of AS-1 RBCs less than 14 days old and also with A1 reagent RBCs. Of 22 sera in which anti-A was detected by RBCs from the A1 units with an IAT, anti-A was detected by RBCs from the A2 unit in only 1 and by the reagent RBCs in 17. In 19 (86%) of the 22 neonatal patients in whose sera anti-A was detected, the antibody was found only with the use of anti-human globulin in the IAT. It is concluded that testing to detect circulating anti-A in neonatal patients should include an IAT, and that it is preferable to use A1 RBCs for the initial evaluation.\r"

A photodynamic flow cell system was designed to inactivate cell-free HIV mixed with blood from a healthy donor. Blood containing 4 x 10(3) infectious units of HIV was treated with 10 and 20 micrograms per mL of commercially available dihematoporphyrin ether (DHE) per mL. Aliquots of this mixture were then held in the dark or irradiated in a flow cell illuminated at a light energy density of 5 J per cm2 provided by a xenon light source equipped with a 630 +/- 5 nm band-pass interference filter; the aliquots were subsequently placed in A.301 cells. All infected cultures were assessed for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity for 17 days. RT activity for either concentration of dye was significantly reduced in irradiated samples as compared to that in samples held in the dark. Blood samples from volunteers also were assessed for the effects of the inactivation process on red cells at concentrations of DHE up to 200 micrograms per mL. No effects were observed on red cell 2,3 DPG or ATP, whole blood potassium concentrations, red cell osmotic fragility, or blood cell antigens.\r"

The units had acceptable freeze-thaw-wash recovery (83.3-91.4%). When a 51Cr label was used for the previously frozen red cells and a simultaneous 52Cr label for freshly drawn autologous red cells was used as a comparison, it was seen that the previously frozen cells had normal 24-hour posttransfusion survival (75.1-88.4%) as well as normal half-life (23-33.7 days). These findings support further extension of the maximum allowable storage time for previously frozen red cells.\r"

Four donations were scheduled at weekly intervals. A predonation hemoglobin concentration of 11 g per dL (110 g/L) was required. Hemoglobin concentration decreased from 14.3 +/- 1.1 g per dL (143 +/- 11 g/L) (mean +/- SD) before the first donation to 11.7 +/- 0.7 g per dL (117 +/- 7 g/L) on Day 22 (p less than or equal to 0.0001). Reticulocyte counts increased from a median of 31,800 (range, 4900-95,000) per microL (median, 32 x 10(9)/L [range, 5-95 x 10(9)/L]) to 93,800 (16,800-194,900) per microL (median, 94 x 10(9)/L [range, 17-195 x 10(9)/L]) on Day 28 (p less than or equal to 0.01). Plasma EPO concentration was 17.8 +/- 5.1 mU per mL prior to the first donation and displayed a small and transient peak after each donation. A sustained elevation followed each peak. Although plasma EPO concentration differed significantly from the baseline value after the first donation, only the peak concentrations after the second (35.5 +/- 15.5 mU/mL), third (38.0 +/- 14.5 mU/mL), and fourth (36.1 +/- 11.0 mU/mL) donations exceeded the normal range. The moderate, biphasic increase in plasma EPO concentration and the moderate increase in erythropoiesis suggest two strategies in autologous blood donation that should be investigated with respect to efficiency and safety: 1) more aggressive donation schemes, which reduce donation intervals and/or the minimum hemoglobin concentration and 2) the administration of recombinant human EPO.\r"

  ".W": "All physicians involved in the evaluation and treatment of infertility rely heavily on the information provided by hysterosalpingography. For many years this study has provided images of the lumina of the fallopian tubes that are not available by other diagnostic means, and it also gives the most accurate outline of the uterine cavity. Hysterosalpingography will therefore continue to be a valuable study in the upcoming decade, and it is important now to take account of the many advances in technology that impinge on the execution and interpretation of this study. In this article we first update the continuing debate about elements of the study itself, involving techniques and the choice of contrast material. We also consider surgical advances, such as the widespread use of microsurgical reconstruction of the fallopian tube, that increase the demand for hysterosalpingography. Since radiologists are asked to evaluate the results of surgery, it is essential for them to be familiar with the postoperative appearances of the fallopian tube. Finally, we consider what must be by far the most important development of the 1990s, the continuing integration of hysterosalpingography with new interventional and imaging techniques. Fallopian tube catheterization expands the examination of the fallopian tube and offers new therapeutic applications. Transvaginal sonography and MR imaging have allowed noninvasive exploration of the female pelvis. Correlation of hysterosalpingography and MR imaging is particularly useful in the diagnosis of uterine myomas and congenital uterine duplication anomalies when surgery to preserve or enhance the reproductive capacity of the uterus is indicated. Sonography and MR imaging should be correlated with hysterosalpingography to provide a more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the common mechanical causes of infertility.\r"

Injection of steroids and anesthetic into the facet joints of the lumbar spine is useful to diagnose or treat patients with facet syndrome (back pain caused by abnormalities of the facet joints). Injection of steroids and anesthetic agents into the epidural space provides short-term relief, and can sometimes provide permanent relief, of lower back pain.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the accuracies of high-resolution CT (HRCT) and conventional CT in determining the specific diagnoses in 75 consecutive patients with chronic diffuse infiltrative lung disease. Without knowledge of clinical or pathologic data, two reviewers independently assessed three separate sets of CT scans in random order: three HRCT scans, three 10-mm collimation CT scans obtained at the same levels as the HRCT scans, and a complete conventional CT scan. The HRCT scans were obtained at the level of the aortic arch, tracheal carina, and 1 cm above the right hemidiaphragm by using 1.5-mm collimation and a high spatial resolution algorithm. Observers gave the most likely diagnosis along with their degree of diagnostic confidence. The correct diagnosis, irrespective of confidence level, was reached with 71% of the HRCT scans and with 72% of both the corresponding 10-mm and complete conventional CT scans. Confidence level 1 (definite) was reached with 49% of HRCT scans, 31% of corresponding 10-mm scans, and 43% of complete conventional CT examinations; the correct diagnosis was made in 92%, 96%, and 94% of those examinations, respectively. In none of the patients were findings on the limited HRCT scan normal when findings on the conventional CT scan were abnormal. We conclude that in most patients with chronic infiltrative lung disease a specific diagnosis can be made by obtaining a limited number of HRCT scans.\r"

Paraquat is a herbicide that has toxic effects on the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Progressive respiratory failure is a frequent cause of death. We analyzed retrospectively 42 patients with a history of paraquat ingestion and abnormal findings on chest radiographs. Radiographic changes during the first week after ingestion included diffuse consolidation (26/39), pneumomediastinum with or without pneumothorax (15/39), and cardiomegaly with widening of the superior mediastinum (8/39). Small cystic and linear shadows began to appear at the end of the first week and were the preponderant parenchymal abnormality after 2-4 weeks. Focal honeycombing was the major parenchymal abnormality after 4 weeks. High-resolution CT of the lung 9 months after paraquat exposure revealed localized fibrosis containing small cysts. Our study shows that the pulmonary manifestations of paraquat poisoning begin with air-space consolidation, which then leads to end-stage lung.\r"

Bipedal lymphangiography was performed in all 12 patients. The last four patients studied also had CT after lymphangiography. Seven patients had abnormal findings on lymphangiograms; five with leaks from the thoracic duct, one with a lymphocele in a nephrectomy bed, and one with obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels after thoracotomy. Five patients had no evidence of lymphatic leakage. CT in one patient with evidence of a leak on lymphangiography showed extravasation of contrast medium into the mediastinum and pleural space. CT in three patients with no abnormalities on lymphangiography also showed no abnormalities. Four of the five thoracic duct lacerations and the lymphocele were confirmed surgically. The diagnosis of obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels was supported clinically. Four of the five patients with normal findings on lymphangiograms had resolution of their pleural effusions and no evidence of recurrence during a follow-up period of 1-27 months. One patient with normal findings on lymphangiography had an alternative diagnosis established at surgery. Laceration of the thoracic duct was accurately diagnosed and localized with lymphangiography, which allowed definitive surgical repair. CT was of little additional value in diagnosing these injuries.\r"

Vasovagal reactions occurred in 27 (7%) of 370 cases, ranging in severity from syncope (four of 370, 1%) to mild light-headedness. These vasovagal reactions were independent of procedure type or use of local anesthesia, but were more common in younger patients. Other complications included prolonged (5 min or longer) bleeding (three of 370, 1%) and extreme pain (two of 370, 1%). One patient was found to have malignant hypertension. We conclude that wire localizations and imaging-guided aspirations are generally well tolerated procedures. However, vasovagal reactions are frequent enough to warrant close observation of patients. Radiologists and breast-imaging personnel should be able to recognize and treat vasovagal reactions.\r"

In nine cases of histologically benign tumors and one case of malignant phylloides tumor, the findings on physical examination, mammography, sonography, and aspiration biopsy were correlated retrospectively with the histologic diagnosis of resected specimens. Mammograms showed a round or lobulated benign-appearing opacity in nine cases; one small tumor was missed mammographically. Sonography depicted all tumors as mostly solid masses. Sonographic features included low-level internal echoes, either uniform or scattered; smooth contours; and no significant posterior shadowing. Intramural cysts were shown in six cases. Neither mammography nor sonography allowed reliable differentiation between benign and malignant phylloides tumors. Aspiration biopsy permitted accurate diagnosis of seven benign tumors. The malignant phylloides tumor was classified as a malignant tumor, but the definite differentiation from a carcinoma could not be made. Two histologically benign phylloides tumors were misdiagnosed as carcinomas. Although uncommon, phylloides tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mammographically benign-appearing breast masses, especially if sonography shows intramural cysts within a well-defined solid lesion. Aspiration cytology is unreliable because of the inhomogeneity of the tumor; both intraoperative frozen section and permanent sections are needed for correct histologic diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Focal (irregular, partial) fatty infiltration of the liver may simulate neoplastic or other hypodense masses on CT. On the basis of previous observations of the phenomenon that differences in X-ray attenuation diminish with increasing energy of X-rays used, we performed a preliminary study to determine if dual-energy CT could be used to discriminate between fatty infiltration and hypodense liver masses. Dual-energy CT at 140 and 80 kVp was performed in 14 patients undergoing liver biopsy and in seven control subjects with presumedly normal liver. Attenuation measurements were taken, and the changes in attenuation between 140 and 80 kVp were calculated. The mean changes in attenuation were 3.5 H for normal liver (n = 7), 2.5 H for hypodense liver masses (n = 6), 13 H for fatty liver (n = 5), 0.3 H for fatty liver combined with hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis (n = 3), and 2 H for the spleen (n = 18). The change in attenuation increased as the fat content in the liver increased. Analysis of variance showed a statistically significant difference (p less than .001) between fatty liver and the other groups. A difference greater than 10 H was unique to fatty infiltration. These results suggest that dual-energy CT may help to differentiate focal fatty infiltration of the liver from low-density neoplastic or other lesions, but only if the iron content of the liver is not increased.\r"

Fourteen patients with known liver tumors were imaged in a 2.0-T prototype ultrafast MR scanner with a spin-echo (infinite TR and TE of 30-340 msec) pulse sequence. Each image was obtained with a total data acquisition time of 20 msec. T2 calculations for hepatic metastases (n = 6) showed a mean of 79.3 +/- 13.5 msec, whereas hemangiomas (n = 8) showed a T2 of 139.8 +/- 18.8 msec (p less than .0001). T2 values of lesions had a smaller relative standard deviation than previously reported, and the range of T2 values of hemangiomas (119-181 msec) and metastases (68-103 msec) did not overlap. Our preliminary results suggest that T2 calculations with ultrafast MR imaging may be useful for differentiating hemangiomas from metastases. We hypothesize that T2 values obtained from ultrafast MR images are more reliable than those obtained from conventional MR images, primarily because of the elimination of T1 information and effects of motion on image signal intensity.\r"

  ".U": "91368663\r", 
  ".W": "To evaluate the sensitivity of sonography, CT, and MR imaging in the detection of hepatic masses in carcinoma patients, we conducted a prospective study of 75 consecutive patients with gastrointestinal tumors who were admitted for surgical resection of the primary tumor. Sonography was performed with convex transducers of 3.5 and 5.0 MHz. Three noninvasive CT techniques were used: unenhanced CT scans, the incremental bolus dynamic scanning technique, and delayed scanning 4-6 hr after bolus injection of 60 g of iodine. MR images (1.5 T) were acquired as presaturated T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences and as breath-holding fast low-angle shot (FLASH) 60 degrees and FLASH 15 degrees sequences. As it is difficult to distinguish benign from malignant masses solely on the basis of morphologic criteria, the techniques for each imaging method were designed to detect and not to characterize hepatic lesions. Each examination was interpreted blindly, and the results were compared with surgical findings, intraoperative sonography, and biopsy of the liver as the gold standard. All focal hepatic masses verified at surgery, malignant or benign, were included in the analysis. Sixty-five (68%) of 95 focal hepatic masses were detected by CT, 60 lesions (63%) by MR, and 50 lesions (53%) by sonography. Although lesions 1-2 cm were shown almost equally well by CT and MR (74% and 77%, respectively), the detection rate of smaller lesions (less than 1.0 cm) decreased more drastically with MR (31%) than with CT (49%). Sonography had a sensitivity of only 20% with the smaller lesions. All imaging techniques had a sensitivity of 100% for focal hepatic masses larger than 2.0 cm. Our results show that CT has a higher overall sensitivity (68%) than MR and sonography for the detection of focal hepatic masses. When the results of the three procedures are combined, the overall sensitivity is 77%. This is unsatisfactorily low, as CT and MR have a size threshold of about 1.0 cm and are relatively unreliable for the detection of smaller lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The Siemens Lithostar Plus protocol (Siemens Medical Systems, Iselin, NJ) allows investigators to perform gallstone lithotripsy on patients regardless of the number of stones they have, provided the stones occupy less than 50% of the gallbladder lumen. The purpose of this study was to determine the interrelationships between stone burden, fragmentation response, and stone-free rates when treatment is not limited to three stones or fewer. Of 200 patients initially examined, 80 (40%) underwent lithotripsy. The mean number of treatments per patient was 2.1, and the mean number of shock waves per patient was 7386. In 60 patients in whom 6-month follow-up was available, the overall stone-free rate, based on actual results, was 32% (19/60). The stone-free rates for solitary stones, two or three stones, and four or more stones were 50%, 12%, and 26%, respectively. Regardless of number of stones, patients who ultimately became stone free had significantly smaller mean fragment size (0.25 cm) 2 weeks after lithotripsy than did those who did not become stone free (0.51 cm). Retrospective volume analysis showed that seven (47%) of 15 patients with multiple stones occupying less than 2000 mm3 were stone free; none became stone free when this volume was exceeded. Lithotripsy remains a practical option for patients with solitary stones. Comparable stone-free rates to those achieved for solitary stones can be obtained in patients with multiple stones, regardless of their number, provided treatment is aggressive and the stone aggregate is less than 2000 mm3.\r"

Thirty healthy volunteers were studied with sonography on three separate occasions to determine the variation of individual gallbladder contractility. Using the ellipsoid method, we measured gallbladder volume after an overnight fast (fasting gallbladder volume) and between 45 and 60 min after a standard fatty meal (residual gallbladder volume). Percentage gallbladder contraction was calculated by dividing the difference between the fasting and residual gallbladder volumes by the fasting gallbladder volume and multiplying by 100. The 90 studies in 30 subjects exhibited a wide range of values: fasting gallbladder volume from 1.9 to 45.5 ml, residual gallbladder volume from 0.1 to 21.0 ml, and percentage gallbladder contraction from -10% to 99%. Within each subject, fasting gallbladder volume measurements varied from 1.5 to 26.2 ml (mean +/- two standard deviations, 10.3 +/- 5.1 ml) and residual gallbladder volume from 0.3 to 15.4 ml (5.1 +/- 3.8 ml). Percentage gallbladder contraction varied from 6% to 87% (28% +/- 18%). In 60% of the subjects, percentage gallbladder contraction values varied by more than 20%, and in 20% of the subjects it varied by more than 40%. These data show that a wide variation exists within a normal person in the degree of gallbladder contraction exhibited from one day to another, and a single test for gallbladder contraction can be misleading.\r"

  ".W": "Preliminary data suggest that barium sulfate suspension is a potentially useful negative gastrointestinal contrast agent for MR imaging. To evaluate this hypothesis in a controlled fashion, abdominal and pelvic MR studies of 10 normal volunteers were performed before and after both oral (600-900 ml) and rectal (400 ml) administration of barium. Standard spin-echo coronal T1-, axial T1-, proton density-, and T2-weighted images were obtained at 1.5 T. Images obtained were randomized and interpreted by three observers, who evaluated bowel visualization and delineation of normal anatomy. Bowel segments evaluated were stomach, duodenum, proximal small bowel, proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum. Anatomic structures examined were pancreatic head, pancreatic body, pancreatic tail, retroperitoneum, spleen, liver, pelvic side walls, uterus, vagina, bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles. Data concerning barium tolerance and safety were recorded. Descriptive, percent change, and kappa statistics were analyzed. Pairwise agreement techniques and repeated measures analysis of variance were performed. This statistical assessment showed a significant improvement in both bowel visualization (59-123% improvement, depending on the segment) and delineation of normal anatomy (23-68% improvement, depending on the structure) after barium administration, particularly on T1-weighted images. In addition, barium was a well-tolerated and safe contrast agent that did not produce artifacts. Our results show that barium sulfate is a useful negative gastrointestinal contrast agent for MR because it improves bowel visualization and delineation of abdominal anatomy, particularly on T1-weighted sequences.\r"

As the pancreatic tail is located anterior to the left adrenal gland, percutaneous biopsy of a left adrenal mass via the anterior approach may result in needle passage through the tail of the pancreas with subsequent potential development of pancreatitis. To evaluate this risk, we retrospectively reviewed 48 CT-directed percutaneous aspiration biopsies of left adrenal masses done between 1984 and 1989 at two institutions. Positioning of the patient, the course of the needle, the number of needle passes, and the size of the needle were analyzed. Thirty-three (69%) of 48 biopsies of a left adrenal mass were performed by using the anterior approach. The pancreas was traversed by one or more needles in 32 of 33 cases. Biopsies were performed with 20- to 22-gauge needles, and the number of needle passes varied widely. The medical records of the 33 patients in whom the anterior approach was used also were reviewed for complications. Acute pancreatitis, which required 11-13 days of hospitalization, developed in two patients (6%). None of the other 31 patients suffered a complication. We conclude that the pancreatic tail is routinely traversed by the biopsy needle when biopsy of a left adrenal mass is done via the anterior approach and that severe acute pancreatitis can occur as a result.\r"

  ".W": "Although conventional radiography is the method most frequently used for monitoring progression of osteoarthritis, it may not show osteoarthritic changes of the knee until late in the disease, and it may show involvement of only one or two compartments in patients who have tricompartmental disease. We compared radiography, CT, and MR imaging for assessing the extent and severity of osteoarthritis of the knee in 20 patients. Radiography included posteroanterior weight-bearing, true lateral, and sunrise patellar projections. Axial CT scans were reformatted in sagittal and coronal planes. MR imaging consisted of spin-echo (600-800/20; 2000/60, 120 [TR/TE]), and gradient-echo (600/30, theta = 30 degrees) sequences. The severity of osteoarthritic changes was graded from 0 to 3. MR frequently showed tricompartmental cartilage loss when radiography and CT showed only bicompartmental involvement in the medial and patellofemoral compartments. In the lateral compartment, MR showed a higher prevalence of cartilage loss (60%) than radiography (35%) and CT (25%) did. In the medial compartment, CT and MR showed osteophytes in 100% of the knees, whereas radiography showed osteophytes in only 60%. Notably, radiography often failed to show osteophytes in the posterior medial femoral condyle. On MR images, meniscal degeneration or tears were found in all 20 knees studied. Partial and complete tears of the anterior cruciate ligament were found in three and seven patients, respectively. MR is more sensitive than radiography and CT for assessing the extent and severity of osteoarthritic changes and frequently shows tricompartmental disease in patients in whom radiography and CT show only bicompartmental involvement. MR imaging is unique for evaluating meniscal and ligamentous disease related to osteoarthritis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the usefulness of 111In-leukocyte scintigraphy for identifying osteomyelitis in the presence of soft-tissue infection, we prospectively studied 45 bone sites adjacent to soft-tissue infection in patients with abnormal findings on radiographs and 99mTc bone scans that were suggestive of osteomyelitis. 111In-leukocyte scans were analyzed in terms of the intensity of abnormal uptake and its location relative to bone. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis was established from results of percutaneous bone biopsy culture (n = 35), histologic examination of surgical specimens (n = 8), and clinical follow-up (n = 2). Osteomyelitis was present at 22 sites, including 16 of 18 sites with increased leukocyte uptake in bone, resulting in a sensitivity of 73%, specificity of 91%, and positive predictive value of 89% for this finding. Osteomyelitis was present at four of 17 sites with predominantly soft-tissue localization of leukocyte activity in the region of bone, none of seven sites with normal leukocyte scans, and two of three sites with diminished leukocyte uptake in bone. Although not helpful in distinguishing infectious from noninfectious bone abnormalities, 3- and especially 24-hr bone scans viewed in conjunction with leukocyte studies provided important correlation to aid in estimating the location of focal abnormal leukocyte uptake. The finding of soft-tissue infection with increased uptake of labeled leukocytes that extends to involve adjacent bone strongly suggests concurrent osteomyelitis. When the presence of abnormal leukocyte uptake in bone is uncertain, additional imaging and possibly biopsy may be required to establish or exclude the diagnosis of osteomyelitis.\r"

  ".W": "Thromboxane (Tx) A2 is a product of cyclooxygenase catalyzed metabolism of arachidonic acid. It is formed via prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxide intermediates (PGG2 and PGH2) by a specific synthase. PGH2 appears to exert the same biologic effects as TxA2. The cDNA for a TxA2 receptor has been cloned from a human placental library. Although pharmacologic and biochemical studies suggest the presence of multiple isoforms, this remains to be confirmed at the molecular level. A hydropathy plot of the deduced amino acid sequence of the available clone suggests that it has 7 transmembrane spanning domains, typical of a G protein linked receptor. Pharmacologic studies imply that Tx receptors in platelets are linked to phospholipase C activation via pertussis toxin insensitive G proteins. Candidates include the 42 kD Gq and the 60 kD Ge. TxA2 acts as an amplifying signal for platelet agonists and the response to this eicosanoid is tightly regulated. Mechanisms include rapid hydrolysis of the agonist to the inactive TxB2, autoinactivation of Tx synthase, rapid homologous TxA2 receptor desensitization due to receptor-G protein uncoupling, coincidental sensitization to counterregulatory Gs linked receptor systems and stimulation of prostacyclin formation by TxA2. Due to its role as an amplification signal in platelet activation, inhibition of Tx synthesis and action is an effective mechanism for preventing platelet-dependent vascular occlusion. Aspirin is of proven efficacy in this regard. Tx synthase inhibitors and antagonists are under clinical investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple drug therapy, including nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antagonists, aspirin, and heparin, has been advocated as effective in the treatment of unstable angina, a syndrome with a multifactorial pathogenesis. Recently, plaque rupture and thrombosis have been demonstrated as the most important pathogenetic mechanisms. Nevertheless, clear-cut results on the effects of thrombolytic treatment in unstable angina are still lacking. Some possible explanations why the medical treatment of unstable angina has still not yet been standardized, whereas that of myocardial infarction has, are suggested. A review of randomized and nonrandomized studies published on this topic evaluating the role of different thrombolytic agents in unstable angina is presented. In addition the role of coronary angiography is discussed. In view of the disappointing results of coronary artery bypass surgery performed in the acute phase of the disease, one of the goals of clinical research is to identify subsets of patients at high and low risk and who undergo different types of therapeutic interventions. To support published data suggesting that total myocardial ischemia has a significant impact on prognosis, we present our results of a study carried out on patients with refractory unstable angina treated with thrombolytic therapy and evaluated with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in the attempt to correlate total myocardial ischemia with short-term prognosis. Data in favor of the prognostic role of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in unstable angina are also reviewed. Finally, we propose some suggestions that might be useful for future studies.\r"

  ".W": "Postinfarction angina carries a poor prognosis, with a 20-70% incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or death within the subsequent 3-6 months. The pathophysiologic mechanisms causing postinfarction angina may include thrombus, complex coronary arterial lesions that form a nidus for thrombus formation, inadequate collateral supply following acute MI, or intimal endothelial dysfunction. The role of thrombus has been established in the pathophysiology of Q-wave MI, and thrombolytic treatment of patients presenting with acute transmural MI has been shown to salvage left ventricular function and to reduce mortality. However, thrombolytic therapy for the acute MI does not reduce the incidence of recurrent ischemia or infarction, as is evident from the 18-26% incidence of recurrent ischemia reported in the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trials. In the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI) study the incidence of reinfarction was documented as 4% in the streptokinase group, which was actually significantly greater than in the placebo group (2%). In a randomized placebo-controlled study of thrombolysis for postinfarction angina, 29 patients were randomized to placebo (P group, n = 17) or to thrombolytic therapy (T group, n = 12). Patient groups were similar with respect to age, location of MI, ejection fraction, severity of coronary artery disease, and antianginal therapy. Patients underwent coronary angiography 6 +/- 1 days postinfarction. Filling defects consistent with intracoronary thrombus was seen in 11 of 12 T group patients and in 11 of 17 P group patients prior to treatment. Lysis occurred in 7 of 11 T patients and 1 of 11 P (p less than 0.02). Holter-detected silent ischemia was compared pre- and posttherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The procedure has a high initial success rate, but there is an increased risk of major complications resulting from a higher incidence of acute closure, which may be related to preexisting thrombus. Resolution of this problem may be achieved by the use of more potent antiplatelet treatment, pretreatment with thrombolytic agents, or treatment that can be applied locally (e.g., laser energy, atherectomy) at the site of the unstable plaque. Results in this study have been obtained from selected groups of patients: those with predominantly single-vessel disease and well-preserved left ventricular function. It remains to be determined whether the same benefits can be achieved in patients with multivessel disease or in those who have severely reduced left ventricular function.\r"

Coronary angioplasty, which is often required to treat the underlying arterial lesion, is adversely affected by the presence of thrombus with at least a 2-fold increase in abrupt closure. Four studies with heparin treatment prior to angioplasty indicate a reduction of abrupt vessel closure from 8-33% to 0-6% with apparent reduction of morbidity; no controlled trials are thus far available for heparin pretreatment. Another therapeutic alternative, thrombolytic therapy, has had quite equivocal results with several negative small studies. When angioplasty has been performed with thrombolytic therapy, a nonfibrin-specific plasminogen activator appears to be preferable. Newer studies that focus on thrombin inhibitors that bind to clot-bound thrombin and potent antiplatelet agents are in the early phase of clinical investigation. This review offers current recommendations for the integration of heparin, thrombolysis, and coronary angioplasty for unstable angina pectoris.\r"

  ".W": "The causes of unstable angina are still largely unknown. However, some facts deriving from angiographic, postmortem, and pathophysiologic studies are well established. Angiographic findings: coronary thrombi and complicated stenoses are more frequent in unstable than in stable angina. Conversely, the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and the development of collateral circulation is similar in both coronary syndromes. Postmortem findings: the following features are more frequent in unstable than in stable angina: (1) mural thrombi, which often represent out-growth from the inside of a fissured plaque; (2) inflammatory cells at the site of plaques and in perivascular nerves; and (3) contraction bands in smooth muscle cells of the media surrounding plaques. However, fissured plaques can be found in 10% of individuals dying of noncardiac causes, and fissured plaque may occasionally be missing under the coronary thrombus in unstable angina. Pathophysiologic findings: patients with unstable angina compared with those with stable angina exhibit: (1) higher levels of serotonin in the coronary sinus; (2) higher systemic levels of fibrino-peptide A; (3) higher urinary levels of thromboxane A2 metabolites; and (4) a greater coronary reactivity to constrictor stimuli. A critical analysis of these established facts is required to set the stage for a better comprehension of the causes which can cause a coronary segment to progress in a stuttering way toward acute persistent coronary occlusion and myocardial infarction. Plaque fissure is likely to be an important background thrombogenic stimulus in many cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Plaque rupture of the thinned, weak fibrous cap infiltrated by macrophages and overlying a pool of lipid in the arterial wall initiates the acute thrombotic event of unstable angina. Thrombosis may be advanced within minutes. Most lesions that precede plaque rupture are minor (less than 50% stenosis); thus, thrombus greatly contributes to sudden flow limitation and onset of symptoms. If thrombosis can be totally blocked (not possible with current antithrombotic agents), clinical events should be preventable, and endogenous thrombolysis may be possible within days. Local and systemic factors contribute to arterial thrombosis. With type III injury (fissure into plaque or media) platelet-rich thrombus anchors in the fissure, tracks along the site of deep injury, extends into the lumen, and requires the highest blood level of specific thrombin inhibition (a molar concentration that inhibits the total concentration of prothrombin in circulating blood). Thus, the thrombin content requiring inhibition in type III injury is highest. Local factors for thrombosis associated with type III injury include the rheology of blood flow (increased shear rate forces platelets to the periphery) and substrates in the arterial wall. Plaque substrates include the more thrombogenic collagens (types I and III and diabetic or glycosylated collagen), tissue thromboplastin, lipid gruel, thrombin bound to arterial wall matrix, and decreased prostacyclin. There is a direct relation between platelet deposition (thrombus) and local vasoconstriction, which may perpetuate each other. Thrombus as a substrate is more thrombogenic than type III arterial injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

(2) Patients with unstable angina have a much higher frequency of severe narrowing of the left main coronary artery than do patients in other coronary subsets. (3) The coronary atherosclerotic plaques in unstable angina consist primarily of fibrous tissue, and they are more similar to those found in patients with sudden coronary death than in patients with acute myocardial infarction. (4) The frequency of acute coronary lesions (thrombi, plaque rupture, and plaque hemorrhage) is similar to that observed in patients with sudden coronary death and significantly less than that observed in acute myocardial infarction. (5) The frequency of multiluminal channels throughout the major coronary arteries is significantly higher in unstable angina compared to sudden coronary death or acute myocardial infarction. (6) The major epicardial arteries and the heart are smaller in patients with unstable angina than in patients with sudden coronary death or acute myocardial infarction.

  ".W": "The majority (greater than 75%) of major coronary thrombi are precipitated by a sudden rupture of the surface of an atherosclerotic plaque (plaque fissuring) causing platelet aggregation where thrombogenic subendothelial tissue has been exposed. Whether the thrombus remains mural and limited, just sealing the rupture, or evolves into an occlusive thrombus seems to depend on: (1) the amount and character of exposed thrombogenic material; (2) the actual thrombotic-thrombolytic equilibrium; and (3) local flow disturbances due to preexisting atherosclerotic stenosis. Thrombus formation may take place within the stenosis, where blood velocity and shear forces are highest, or it may take place or extend poststenotically, where flow separation, recirculation, and turbulence prevail. Platelet aggregation within the stenosis is responsible for the primary flow obstruction, but fibrin subsequently enmeshes the platelets and thus stabilizes the thrombus. Most thrombi have a layered structure, indicating an episodic growth that may alternate with thrombus fragmentation and peripheral embolization: thrombosis and thrombolysis are dynamic processes occurring simultaneously. If the platelet-rich thrombus at the rupture site evolves into an occlusive thrombus, the blood proximal and distal to the occlusion may stagnate and coagulate, giving rise to a secondarily formed red stagnation thrombosis consisting predominantly of erythrocytes held together by fibrin membranes. A ruptured plaque with a dynamic thrombosis superimposed (with or without spasm) seems to underlie the great majority of acute ischemic syndromes: unstable angina, acute infarction, and sudden death. The clinical presentation and the outcome depend on the severity and duration of ischemia: whether the obstruction is occlusive or nonocclusive, transient or persistent--modified by the magnitude of collateral flow.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated incidence, severity, and distribution of coronary atherosclerosis, acute thrombosis, and plaque fissuring in ischemic heart disease (both unstable-acute syndromes and chronic ischemia) and in nonischemic controls. We also studied the structural, immunohistochemical, and biochemical profile of plaques, with and without thrombus, including morphometry, immunophenotyping of inflammatory infiltrates, cytokine presence, and ultrastructural features. Critical coronary stenosis was almost the rule in both acute and chronic ischemic series (greater than 90%) whereas it reached 50% in control subjects. Thrombosis was principally characteristic of unstable-acute ischemic syndromes (unstable angina, 32%; acute myocardial infarction, 52%; cardiac sudden death, 26%) but was also found in chronic ischemia (stable angina, 12%; ischemic cardiomyopathy, 14%) and in control subjects (4%). Plaque fissuring without thrombus occurred in low percentages in lipid-rich, severe eccentric plaques in most series. Major differences were found between pultaceous-rich versus fibrous plaques rather than between plaques with or without thrombus. Pultaceous-rich plaques were frequent in sites of critical stenosis, thrombosis, and ulceration. Inflammatory infiltrates, i.e., T cells, macrophages, and a few beta cells, mostly occurred in lipid-rich, plaques unrelated to thrombus. In adventitia, infiltrates were a common finding unrelated to any syndrome. Necrotizing cytokines such as alpha-TNF were immunohistochemically detected in macrophages, smooth muscle, and intimal cells and detected by immunoblotting in 67% of pultaceous-rich plaques, either with or without thrombus. Immune response mediators such as IL-2 were also expressed in analogous plaques but in a minor percentage (50%-40%). Media were extensively damaged in severely diseased vessels with and without thrombus. Ultrastructural study showed that the fibrous cap was either highly cellular or densely fibrillar. Intimal injury with collagen exposure was often associated with platelet adhesion, whereas foamy cell exposure was not. In conclusion, investigated parameters were essentially similar in plaques, both with and without thrombus, whereas major differences were found between pultaceous-rich and fibrous plaques. Since platelets adhere to exposed collagen and not to foam cells, the type of exposed substrates could play a major role in thrombosis.\r"

Thus, the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2, which is largely derived from activated platelets, is increased, often coincident with chest pain. The major role of platelets in unstable angina may influence the response to plasminogen activators. Platelets increase the resistance of thrombi to lysis, by inducing clot retraction and cross-linking and by releasing inhibitors. Thus, coronary thrombi in unstable angina may be resistant to lysis. Furthermore, both t-PA and streptokinase cause platelet activation and thrombin formation in vivo, possibly via plasmin. Plasmin can activate platelets and factor V directly. These prothrombotic effects of plasminogen activators may limit their activity in unstable angina. At the very least, their therapeutic efficacy may be highly dependent on the coadministration of potent antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants.\r"

Urine was collected over 24 hours the day before coronary arteriography, and blood samples were taken at the end of urine collection. When the values of fibrinopeptide A in plasma and in the 24-hour urine specimens were compared, no significant correlation was found in patients with either stable (rs = 0.16, difference not significant) and unstable (rs = 0.07, difference not significant) angina. The concentrations of fibrinopeptide A in the plasma did not differ significantly when patients with stable angina (range 0.1 to 82.6, median 7.4 ng/mL) were compared with patients with unstable angina (range 0.2 to 61.7, median 14 ng/mL, p = 0.055), whereas fibrinopeptide A 24-hour urinary excretion was significantly higher in patients with unstable angina (range 0.3 to 38.1, median 11.8 micrograms/24 hr) than in patients with stable angina (range 0.4 to 38.1, median 3.8 micrograms/24 hr, p less than 0.001). Twenty-four-hour urine excretion of fibrinopeptide A in patients with unstable angina and angiographically documented intracoronary thrombi were higher than the corresponding values in patients with unstable angina without such angiographic characteristic (p less than 0.001). The largest increase in plasma and urine concentration of fibrinopeptide A was observed in patients whose first episode of angina at rest occurred within the previous 48 hours. We conclude that the cumulative thrombin activity, assessed by 24-hour urinary excretion of fibrinopeptide A, is a more useful index, compared with single fibrinopeptide A measurement in plasma, for discriminating between patients with stable and with unstable angina pectoris.\r"

  ".W": "Within the last decade, it has been appreciated that the acute coronary syndromes of unstable angina, non-Q-wave, and Q-wave myocardial infarction often share a common pathogenesis based on plaque disruption and thrombosis. Such \"acute\" lesions frequently have a characteristic angiographic appearance with sharp overhanging edges, irregular borders, and intraluminal lucency. This review focuses on the benefits and limitations of qualitative assessment of coronary lesion morphology, with respect to the sensitivity, specificity, and prognostic significance of complex lesions and intracoronary thrombi. Angiographic findings following thrombolysis for unstable angina are discussed, as well as the possible role for thrombolytic therapy as an adjunct to angioplasty in unstable angina.\r"

The benefits were present during the acute, subacute and more chronic phases of the disease and were independent of the doses and of other protocol differences. This benefit of aspirin can be extended to some, but not all, other antiplatelet drugs. In 4 clinical trials, heparin used acutely added substantial benefit to the management of unstable angina, reducing the event rate and also the incidence of refractory angina more than aspirin. The long-term benefit of antithrombin therapy remains to be more thoroughly investigated. Despite these successes, the failure rate of aspirin and of heparin remains high, justifying a continuing search for more potent and safe antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs.\r"

Consequently, thrombolytic treatment, already established to be highly beneficial in patients with acute myocardial infarction, might also be indicated in patients with unstable angina. The clinical response to thrombolytic treatment has been evaluated in several small-sized studies with inconsistent and somewhat deceiving results. Thus, the role of thrombolysis in the treatment of unstable angina is still controversial. Two ongoing large-scale, randomized, controlled trials, the Third Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI III) in the United States testing recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator and UNASEM in Europe testing anisoylated plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex will, it is hoped, solve the debate. At present, early thrombolysis might be considered for the treatment of the subset of patients with severe rest angina associated with transient ST-T ischemic changes.\r"

The incremental prognostic information concerning 1-year survival obtained from such a sequence in 107 patients with AMI was studied using logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic curves. Cardiac mortality was 24% at 1 year. Clinical data obtained soon after admission (prior myocardial infarction, heart rate, blood pressure, age) were 78 +/- 5% accurate in the prediction of 1-year survival. The addition of radionuclide-estimated left ventricular ejection fraction or invasive hemodynamic data to the clinical model at this time improved prognostic accuracy to 84 +/- 5% (p = 0.05) and 87 +/- 4% (p = 0.007), respectively. The further addition of invasive data to the model containing clinical and left ventricular ejection fraction data provided a further increment in prognostic accuracy to 89 +/- 4%, whereas no significant increase in accuracy was seen on addition of left ventricular ejection fraction to the model containing clinical and invasive data. It is concluded that clinical data provide important prognostic information concerning late survival early in the course of AMI. This may be improved by the logical application of noninvasive and invasive studies at this time.\r"

Treatment began within 24 hours of admission. Serial echocardiographic measurements of endocardial segment lengths and left ventricular (LV) volumes, and ejection fractions were obtained. The 2 groups were matched at baseline except for an excess of previous AMI in the placebo group (13 of 50 vs 2 of 49 patients, p = 0.002). The increase in anterior segment length, from baseline to 2 months, was significantly less in the captopril than in the placebo group (2.8 +/- 1.6 vs 10.4 +/- 2.4mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] -13.5 to -1.7, p = 0.01). The increase in posterior segment length was also less in the captopril group, but the difference was not significant (3.2 +/- 1.2 vs 7.0 +/- 1.8mm, 95% CI -8.0 to 0.5, p = 0.08). Fewer patients in the captopril group demonstrated increases in segment length greater than 2 standard deviations of the measurement error (14 of 70 [20%] vs 29 of 72 [40%] patients, p = 0.009). In patients with anterior AMI, the infarct-containing anterior segment length increased by 4.5 +/- 2.3 mm in the captopril versus 12.4 +/- 3.1 mm in the placebo group (95% CI -15.7 to -0.2, p = 0.046), and fewer patients in the captopril group demonstrated infarct expansion (6 of 20 [30%] vs 13 of 21 [62%] patients, p = 0.04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The electrocardiograms were recorded from 49 men with a documented Q-wave myocardial infarction and from 30 age-matched normal men. Forty consecutive beats were averaged to achieve an average ECG signal from which variance could be calculated. The relative variance, defined as the ratio between the integrated variance of the examined window and the integrated variance of the ECG signal that was close to full cycle length, was calculated at QRS onset and at offset in 2 frequency bands (4 to 40 and 60 to 120 Hz). Patients with healed infarction had a relative variance of 2.1 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) at QRS offset (a window of 40 ms), which was significantly lower than that of the healthy volunteers: 2.5 +/- 0.33 (mean +/- SD; p less than 0.02) at the low-frequency band. At the high-frequency band, patients with healed infarction had a significantly higher relative variance than the control subjects at QRS onset: 1.95 +/- 0.58 vs 1.55 +/- 0.35 (mean +/- SD; p less than 0.005). A model based on the numerous minor conduction abnormalities that exist in the chronically ischemic myocardium is presented to explain the changes in variance at the onset and offset of the QRS. The variance changes described can eventually serve as quantitative indexes of myocardial injury and electrical stability in patients with ischemic heart disease.\r"

Thirty-two patients were asymptomatic during balloon dilations of 36 arteries, and 56 patients had angina during PTCA of 64 arteries. There were no differences in age, sex, prior anginal history, antianginal regimen, extent of coronary artery disease and number or duration of inflations between the 2 study groups. Previous infarction (33 vs 12%, p less than 0.02), Q waves in the target area (31 vs 7%, p less than 0.005) and diabetes mellitus (36 vs 17%, p less than 0.05) were present more often in the asymptomatic group. Sixty-four% of all asymptomatic patients had either diabetes or previous infarction in the target territory. Collateral circulation was more frequent in asymptomatic patients, probably reflecting the ability of collateral arteries to ameliorate ischemia. During 2-vessel PTCA, patients without angina during dilation of only 1 of the 2 treated arteries (discordant responders) had previous infarction in that artery's territory (5 of 5, 100%), whereas patients without previous infarction were either symptomatic or asymptomatic (concordant responders) during PTCA of both arteries. This study shows that asymptomatic ischemia occurs frequently during PTCA in patients with symptomatic coronary disease. Prior Q-wave infarction and diabetes mellitus are important, independent factors associated with painless ischemia. It is suggested that infarction produces a localized dysfunction of afferent cardiac pain fibers, whereas diabetes can cause a global cardiac sensory neuropathy.\r"

There were 21 male and 12 female patients with a mean age of 11 years (range 1 to 18). Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence (14 patients) or absence (19 patients) of syncope. Patients with syncope had ostensibly normal hearts (9 patients) or miscellaneous heart disease (5 patients). Patients without syncope had ostensibly normal hearts (8 patients) or miscellaneous heart disease (11 patients). Ventricular stimulation protocol consisted of burst pacing and 1 to 4 programmed extrastimuli decreasing to refractoriness at 3 drive-train cycle lengths, and at 2 pacing sites (right ventricular apex and outflow tract) during the drug-free baseline state and isoproterenol infusion. No patient had VT induced with 1 or 2 extrastimuli. VT was induced in 13 of 14 patients (93%) with syncope, and in 9 of 19 patients (47%) without syncope (p less than 0.05). Using a 3-extrastimuli protocol, 8 of 14 patients (57%) with and 3 of 19 patients (16%) without syncope had VT induced (p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that VT may be the cause of syncope in young patients with complex ventricular ectopic activity.\r"

This study attempts to quantitate differences in the fine morphology of P waves in a group of 9 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) versus 15 control subjects. Atrial triggered signal-averaging was combined with a detailed investigation of P-wave duration, high-frequency spatial voltage and spatial velocity. Signal-averaged P-wave duration was significantly increased in patients with paroxysmal AF (135 +/- 8 vs 126 +/- 4 ms, p less than 0.05). The root-mean-square voltage at frequencies greater than 35 Hz in these patients was also significantly greater (16 +/- 3 vs 12 +/- 1 microV, p less than 0.05). Similar observations were made at frequencies greater than 40 Hz (10 +/- 3 vs 7 +/- 1 microV, p less than 0.05). These differences appeared to be confined to the third quarter of the P wave (third quarter root-mean-square voltage at greater than 40 Hz expressed as a ratio of total P-wave root-mean-square voltage, 1.4 +/- 0.1 vs 1.2 +/- 0.1, p = 0.005). Spatial velocity was also increased in the paroxysmal AF group (peak spatial velocity 6.4 +/- 1.8 vs 4.6 +/- 0.5 mV/s, p less than 0.05). These observations support previous intracardiac data that implicate delay and fragmentation of intraatrial conduction in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal AF.\r"

To evaluate these suggestions, 83 patients with LBBB who underwent thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and coronary angiography within an interval of 3 months were retrospectively reviewed. There were 59 men and 24 women aged 33 to 84 years (mean 65). Myocardial perfusion to the apex, anterior wall and anterior septum were scored qualitatively by consensus of 2 experienced observers and by quantitative analysis in comparison with a normal data base. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of perfusion defects in these segments were then expressed according to angiographic findings. Significant stenosis of vessels within the left anterior descending artery territory was present in 38 patients. By receiver-operator characteristic analysis, a fixed or reversible defect within the apex by the qualitative method was the best criterion for coronary artery disease. However, although highly sensitive (79 and 85% by the qualitative and quantitative methods, respectively), an apical defect was neither specific (38 and 16%, respectively), nor accurate (57 and 46%, respectively). Perfusion abnormalities in the anterior wall and septum were also of limited diagnostic accuracy. Thus, modified interpretative criteria in patients with LBBB are not clinically useful in the assessment of left anterior descending artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Midventricular obstruction is an uncommon finding previously defined by catheterization and angiographic techniques in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This study describes the clinical and echocardiographic findings of 10 consecutive patients (mean age 73 years) with severe concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and the unusual finding of a dynamic systolic obstruction located in the midportion of the left ventricle. All patients were known to have chronic hypertension, and none had a history or family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In each case, a well-defined, high velocity, turbulent jet was identified by Doppler color flow imaging and subsequently confirmed with conventional Doppler techniques. Septal and posterior wall thickness averaged 1.67 and 1.57 cm, respectively. Mean LV mass index was 199 g/m2 and ejection fraction averaged 78%. Peak systolic velocity obtained by continuous-wave Doppler averaged 2.7 m/s and appeared as either a \"late-peaking\" or a \"spike and dome\" configuration. Seven of 10 patients gave a history of syncope or severe presyncope at the time of echocardiographic examination. At a mean follow-up of 1 year, syncope or presyncope had resolved in 5 patients in whom medication was adjusted based on the ultrasound study, but persisted in 2 patients in whom diuretic therapy was continued. It is concluded that obstruction to systolic flow can occur at the mid-LV level in some patients with severe concentric LV hypertrophy and avoidance of medication known to lower LV volume may relieve symptoms of transient inadequate cardiac output.\r"

The aim of this study was to establish the occurrence and clinical significance of adrenergic hypersensitivity after abrupt withdrawal of long-term beta blockade in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Beta-adrenergic sensitivity was measured using the isoprenaline chronotropic dose25. Symptom assessment chronotropic dose25 calculation, bicycle exercise, echocardiography and Holter monitoring were performed while the patient received beta-blocker therapy and repeated on days 2, 4, 6, 8 (acute withdrawal period) and on day 21 after abrupt withdrawal. The study was terminated after 7 patients had been studied because all patients experienced a marked deterioration in symptoms and several clinical events had occurred. The chronotropic dose25 (mean +/- standard deviation) demonstrated beta 1-adrenergic hypersensitivity with a minimal value of 1.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms during the acute withdrawal period compared with 3.8 +/- 1.7 micrograms on day 21 (p = 0.003). Heart rates during rest and exercise showed an overshoot increase during the acute withdrawal period. The maximal 24-hour ventricular ectopic count was higher during the acute withdrawal period than during day 21 (p = 0.04). Of 3 patients with inducible outflow tract gradients, 2 developed resting gradients greater than 30 mm Hg during the acute withdrawal period. There was an increase in peak late filling velocity of mitral inflow after beta-blocker withdrawal. In conclusion, transient beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity occurs after beta-blocker withdrawal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is associated with significant physiologic changes and adverse clinical consequences.\r"

  ".W": "Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography were performed in 70 subjects (aged 1 day to 16 years, body surface area from 0.08 to 2.1 m2) to determine aortic and pulmonary valve areas in normal children and adolescents. Valve areas were determined by the continuity equation using echo-determined ventricular outflow tract diameters and Doppler-determined flow velocities from the outflow tracts and corresponding great arteries. Left ventricular outflow tract diameter ranged from 0.3 to 2.2 cm and right ventricular outflow tract diameter from 0.4 to 2.8 cm. Outflow tract diameters were linearly related to the square root of body surface area. Flow velocity increased from a mean of 0.75 m/s in the left ventricular outflow tract to 1.12 m/s in the aorta and from 0.56 m/s in the right ventricular outflow tract to 0.89 m/s in the pulmonary artery. Flow velocities were unrelated to body size. Valve areas were linearly related to body surface area (r = 0.88 and 0.80 for the aortic and pulmonary valves, respectively). Mean aortic and pulmonary valve area indexes were 1.33 cm2/m2 and 1.70 cm2/m2, respectively. The data provide normal values for echocardiographically determined valve areas and validate the practice of indexing valve area for body surface area.\r"

  ".W": "Quantification of variations in instantaneous heart rate (HR) can be used to evaluate cardiac autonomic function. A 24-hour standard deviation of all normal RR intervals less than 50 ms in survivors of myocardial infarction has been shown to be an independent marker of adverse prognosis. Twenty-four-hour HR variability in 140 healthy subjects aged 40 to 77 years was determined as (1) standard deviation, and (2) percentage of successive RR interval differences greater than 6%--an index of parasympathetic activity. The 24-hour standard deviation varied between 68 and 261 ms (median 139). Range for index of parasympathetic activity was 0.1 to 29.6% (median 4.4). Twenty percent of the interindividual variation in HR variability was explained by impact of risk factors. Standard deviation was uninfluenced by age, whereas parasympathetic activity decreased by increasing age. High physical training level was independently associated with significantly higher standard deviation (and parasympathetic activity) values during both day and night. Hourly figures of standard deviation decreased during the night, whereas parasympathetic activity increased and peaked early morning. Standard deviation values as low as those reported in high-risk patients were not observed, but comparable low values for, and lack of diurnal variation in, parasympathetic activity were seen in healthy subjects also. In conclusion, risk factors and, in particular, the physical training level have impact on 24-hour HR variability in healthy subjects. This may prove valuable for modification of cardiac autonomic activity in patients.\r"

  ".W": "A nonisotopic, in situ hybridization procedure is described for detecting Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA in cytopreparations of pepsin-digested, unfixed cells in less than 3 hours. The procedure, which uses an EBV Bam HI W DNA probe conjugated directly to horseradish peroxidase, first was optimized using an EBV-infected cell line (ARH-77) and then validated on four positive control specimens and six negative control specimens. Optimization studies demonstrated distinct nuclear hybridization signal in less than 10% of formaldehyde-fixed, pepsin-digested ARH-77 cells. When formaldehyde fixation was omitted, more than 50% of the pepsin-digested ARH-77 cells had strong nuclear staining. Unfixed cells from the four positive controls had detectable hybridization signal; the presence of EBV-DNA in these specimens also was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction. There was no hybridization signal in the six negative control specimens. The results indicate that this nonisotopic, in situ hybridization procedure rapidly detects the presence of EBV-DNA in cytopreparations of unfixed, pepsin-digested cells from clinical specimens. There is a tradeoff, however, between assay sensitivity and preservation of cytologic details.\r"
