  ".W": "The presence of abundant neurofibrillary tangles in certain areas of the brain constitutes one of the defining pathological characteristics of Alzheimer disease. The predominant component of the tangle is an abnormal fibrous assembly known as the paired helical filament (PHF). The PHF is formed by a twisted double-helical ribbon of subunits that gives rise to an image alternating in width between 8 nm and 20 nm with a cross-over spacing of 80 nm. Also found in tangles is the straight filament (SF), a different kind of abnormal filament, about 15 nm wide, that does not exhibit the marked modulation in width shown by the PHF. It is reported herein that PHFs and SFs form hybrid filaments displaying both morphologies, that PHFs and SFs share surface epitopes, and that computed maps reveal a similar C-shaped morphological unit in PHFs and SFs, though differing in relative arrangement in the two types of filament. The observations imply that the SF is a structural variant of the PHF and establish a common unit of assembly for these two pathological filaments.\r"

In insects, the task of establishing the earliest pathways is accomplished by a small number of neurons, termed pioneers. These neurons have axons that lay down an early scaffold, which provides a substrate for many later-developing axons. Here we show that a similar type of cell exists in the embryonic vertebrate brain. Using light- and electron-microscopic techniques we have examined the formation of one of the earliest tracts in the zebrafish brain. We find that it is pioneered at a precise time by the growth cone of a single neuron present in a predictable location. These observations show a fundamental similarity in the establishment of axonal pathways in the central nervous systems of both invertebrates and vertebrates.\r"

  ".U": "91172800\r", 
  ".W": "The principal sequence feature responsible for intrinsic DNA curvature is generally assumed to be runs of adenines. However, according to the wedge model of DNA curvature, each dinucleotide step is associated with a characteristic deflection of the local helix axis. Thus, an important test of a more general view of sequence-dependent DNA curvature is whether sequence elements other than A-A cause the DNA axis to deflect. To address this question, we have applied the wedge model to a large body of experimental data. The axial path of DNA can be described at each step by three Eulerian angles: the helical twist, the deflection angle (wedge angle), and the direction of the deflection. Circularization and gel electrophoretic mobility data on 54 synthetic DNA fragments, both from other laboratories and from our own, were used to compare the theoretical predictions of the wedge model with experiment. By minimizing misfit between calculated and observed DNA curvature, we have found that the stacks AG/CT, CG/CG, GA/TC, and GC/GC, in addition to AA/TT, have large wedge values. We have also synthesized seven sequences without AA/TT elements but with these other wedges correctly phased to cause appreciable predicted curvature. All appear curved as demonstrated by anomalous gel mobilities. The full set of 16 roll and tilt wedge angles is estimated and, together with the known 10 helical twists, these allow prediction of the general sequence-dependent trajectory of the DNA axis.\r"

Many other testis-specific genes have a similar structure and are probably also constitutively unmethylated. Pgk-2, a non-CpG-island gene, is similar to somatic tissue-specific genes in that it is highly methylated in nonexpressing cell types but undermethylated in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, where it is actively transcribed. At later stages of spermatogenesis, however, the gene becomes remethylated and thus acquires the full modification pattern in sperm DNA. In all these cases, the sperm DNA that emerges from the testis does not contain any germ-line-specific unmethylated sites and thus carries the methylation pattern typical of that in somatic tissues.\r"

The salmon Sma I family is present in the genomes of two species of the genus Oncorhynchus but not in other species, including five other species of the same genus. The charr Fok I family is present only in four species and subspecies of the genus Salvelinus. The third family, the salmonid Hpa I family, appears to be present in all salmonid species but is not present in species that are not members of the Salmonidae. Thus, the genome of proto-Salmonidae was originally shaped by amplification and dispersion of the salmonid Hpa I family and then reshaped by amplification of the Sma I and Fok I families in the more recently evolved species of salmon and charr, respectively. We speculate that amplification and dispersion of retroposons may have played a role in salmonid speciation.\r"

  ".W": "An approach to isolating DNA sequences that are linked to important plant genes is described. The strategy is based upon a recent modification of the polymerase chain reaction in which synthetic primers are used to amplify random sequences from genomic DNA. This technique, used in conjunction with near-isogenic lines (which differ only by the presence or absence of the target gene and a small region of surrounding DNA), leads to the rapid identification of sequences linked to the gene of interest. The feasibility of this method has been demonstrated by analyzing a pair of tomato near-isogenic lines that differ for a region on chromosome 5 that contains a gene (Pto) conferring resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. One hundred forty-four random primers were screened on these lines, and seven amplified products were identified that were present in one but not the other line. Of four products that were further investigated, three were confirmed by segregation analysis to be tightly linked to the Pto gene. Linked sequences identified by this method are useful for detecting the presence of the target gene in plant populations (e.g., in plant breeding) and, if very tightly linked, as starting points for a chromosome walk to isolate the gene. Since near-isogenic lines are a typical product of plant breeding and classical genetic studies, this method is applicable to a wide variety of species.\r"

As well, W and Sl mutants can be anemic and sterile, whereas mi mice are osteopetrotic due to a monocyte/macrophage defect. Recent data have shown that the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase is the gene product of the W locus, whereas Sl encodes the ligand for this growth factor receptor. We show here that ectopic expression of c-fms, a gene that encodes a macrophage growth factor receptor that is closely related to the c-kit receptor, complements mutations at the W locus in an in vitro mast cell/fibroblast coculture system but is unable to reverse the inability of mi/mi mast cells to survive under these conditions. Furthermore, mast cells expressing the c-fms receptor survive on a monolayer of fibroblasts homozygous for the Sl mutation. These results suggest that ligand binding to the c-kit or c-fms receptor activates identical or overlapping signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, they suggest that mi encodes a protein necessary for transducing signals mediated by way of either the c-kit or c-fms receptor.\r"

To analyze the relative Myb dependence of normal and leukemic human hematopoietic progenitor cells, normal bone marrow cells, several types of leukemic blast cells, and 1:1 mixtures of normal and leukemic cells were cultured in the presence of c-myb sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; cell viability and cloning efficiency were then assessed. c-myb sense oligomers had negligible effects on normal and leukemic cells. In contrast, c-myb antisense oligomers strongly inhibited or completely abolished clonogenic growth of a T-cell leukemia line, 78% (18 of 23) of primary acute myelogenous leukemia cases examined, and 4 of 5 primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases in blast crisis. In three of the latter patients, polymerase chain reaction analysis of a 1:1 mixture of c-myb antisense-treated normal and CML cells revealed a complete absence of bcr-abl expression, suggesting that the CML clonogenic units had been completely eliminated from the cultures. At antisense doses that inhibited leukemic cell growth, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells survived. Thus, normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells show differential sensitivity to the toxic effects of c-myb antisense DNA. Perturbation of c-myb function with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides might eventually form the basis for a molecular approach to leukemia therapy, perhaps most immediately as ex vivo bone marrow purging agents.\r"

To investigate the role of apoE in adrenal cholesterol homeostasis, we have expressed a human apoE genomic clone in the Y1 mouse adrenocortical cell line. Y1 cells do not express endogenous apoE mRNA or protein. Expression of apoE in Y1 cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in basal steroidogenesis; secretion of fluorogenic steroid was reduced 7- to greater than 100-fold relative to Y1 parent cells. Addition of 5-cholesten-3 beta,25-diol failed to overcome the suppression of steroidogenesis in these cells. Cholesterol esterification under basal conditions, as measured by the production of cholesteryl [14C]oleate, was similar in the Y1 parent and the apoE-transfected cell lines. Upon incubation with adrenocorticotropin or dibutyryl cAMP, production of cholesteryl [14C]oleate decreased 5-fold in the Y1 parent cells but was unchanged in the apoE-transfected cell lines. These results suggest that apoE may be an important modulator of cholesterol utilization and steroidogenesis in adrenal cells.\r"

This analysis led to the unexpected discovery that the DNA length is synchronized between successive 3' splicing sites as well as between successive 5' splicing sites, with a frame of approximately 205 base pairs.

By using this technique, we have obtained broadband IR absorbance difference spectra after photolysis of bacteriorhodospin with a time resolution of approximately 50 microseconds, spectral resolution of 4 cm-1, and a detection limit of delta A less than or equal to 10(-4). These capabilities permit observation of detailed structural changes in individual residues as bacteriorhodopsin passes through its L, M, and N intermediate states near physiological temperatures. When combined with band assignments based on isotope labeling and site-directed mutagenesis, the stroboscopic Fourier transform IR difference spectra show that on the time scale of the L intermediate, Asp-96 has an altered environment that may be accompanied by change in its protonation state. On the time scale of the L----M transition, this Asp-96 perturbation/deprotonation is largely reversed, and Asp-85 becomes protonated. During the M----N transition, Asp-85 appears to remain protonated but undergoes a change in its environment as evidenced by a shift of vC = O from 1761 to 1755 cm-1. The retention of a proton on Asp-85 in the N state indicates that the proton transferred from the Schiff base to this residue in the L----M step is not released to the extracellular medium during the same photocycle, but rather during a subsequent one. Also during the M----N transition, Asp-96 undergoes a deprotonation (possibly for the second time in a single photocycle). Bands in the amide I and amide II spectral regions in the M----N difference spectrum indicate the occurrence of a conformational change involving one or more peptide groups in the protein backbone.\r"

Neutrophils adhere in a dose-dependent fashion to granule membrane protein 140 (GMP140), a member of the LEC-CAM (lectin/epidermal growth factor/complement-binding domain cell adhesion molecule) family of adhesion proteins when it is immobilized onto plastic surfaces. Adherence to GMP140 was associated with less superoxide anion generation than adherence to other surfaces, an effect that is especially remarkable after activation of neutrophils with tumor necrosis factor alpha, an agent that on other surfaces promotes adhesion and spreading. However, on GMP140 the cells fail to spread and instead remain rounded and refractile. Neutrophils adhering to GMP140 were also deficient in superoxide anion generation to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine. Furthermore, fluid-phase GMP140 also inhibited the superoxide generation by neutrophils stimulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha. The effect of GMP140 was reversible by washing and was inhibited by anti-GMP140 Fab antibody. GMP140 appears to be a natural antiinflammatory molecule that may prevent the inappropriate activation of neutrophils in the circulation.\r"

Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the monoecious population mates at random. The character is determined by arbitrarily many multiallelic loci without epistasis; the linkage map is also arbitrary. The genotypic values of the character are constant. Rounds on the absolute error in the above approximation are deduced for an arbitrary character, and these are converted to bounds on the relative error when the character is fitness itself. In that case, C is the genic variance in fitness, and the relative error cannot exceed one half the greatest genotypic selection coefficient.\r"

The technique of in situ hybridization was used to study postmeiotic distribution of transcripts from the mouse protamine 1 (Prm-1) gene among spermatids of mice with chromosomally unbalanced gametes. The Prm-1 gene is located on chromosome 16 and is expressed exclusively in haploid spermatids. Mice doubly heterozygous for two Robertsonian translocations involving chromosome 16 were used for the study of postmeiotic accumulation of transcripts of the Prm-1 gene in spermatogenic cells. The meiotic segregation pattern of chromosomal homologues in these mice produces some spermatids that are chromosomally unbalanced; some spermatids lack chromosome 16 while others have two. In situ hybridization with a cDNA probe for the Prm-1 gene transcript performed on both whole testis sections and spermatogenic cell suspensions showed that there was no statistical difference in distribution of grains over step-5 to step-10 spermatids from Robertsonian-translocation heterozygous mice and from control mice of normal karyotype. These results are consistent with sharing of transcripts of the Prm-1 gene among spermatids within a syncytium.\r"

The primary structure of this allatostatin has been elucidated by tandem mass spectrometry: Ala-Tyr-Ser-Tyr-Val-Ser-Glu-Tyr-Lys-Arg-Leu-Pro-Val-Tyr-Asn-Phe-Gly-Leu- NH2 (ASB2). The amidated three-residue C terminus of this type B allatostatin is identical to that of four known type A allatostatins, and the preceding three residues show close structural homology. ASB2 has over twice the activity of the type A tridecapeptide Ala-Pro-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gln-Arg-Leu-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Gly-Leu-NH2 (ASA1) in inhibiting juvenile hormone biosynthesis in corpora allata from females in early vitellogenesis (day 2), and its efficacy persists during pregnancy, but it is equally effective as ASA1 on glands from day-10 females (IC50 = 0.31 nM). The octadecapeptide is characterized by a potential dibasic cleavage site, Lys9-Arg10, the integrity of which is needed for high potency. The ASB2-(11-18)-octapeptide amide gives a full response at high concentrations at day 10 (IC50 = 48 nM), but the C-truncated (1-9)-, (1-11)-, and (1-17)-amide fragments of ASB2 are inactive. Thus, the endocrine message is located at the C terminus. N alpha-acetylation of the N-truncated (9-18), (10-18), and (11-18) fragments of ASB2 increases activity relative to the nonacetylated peptides. The site of action of type A and type B allatostatins is located before mevalonate kinase in the biosynthetic pathway for juvenile hormone.\r"

A mutant DNA polymerase with very little (less than or equal to 1%) 3'----5' exonuclease activity was generated. In vivo, the 3'----5' exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase produced the highest level of spontaneous mutation observed in T4, 500- to 1800-fold above that of wild type. The large reduction in 3'----5' exonuclease activity appears to be due to two amino acid substitutions: Glu-191 to Ala and Asp-324 to Gly. Protein sequence similarities have been observed between sequences in the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I 3'----5' exonuclease domain and conserved sequences in eukaryotic, viral, and phage DNA polymerases. It has been proposed that the conserved sequences contain metal ion binding ligands that are required for 3'----5' exonuclease activity; however, we find that some proposed T4 DNA polymerase metal binding residues are not essential for 3'----5' exonuclease activity. Thus, our T4 DNA polymerase studies do not support the hypothesis by Bernad et al. [Bernad, A., Blanco, L., Lazaro, J.M., Martin, G. & Salas, M. (1989) Cell 59, 219-228] that many DNA polymerases, including T4 DNA polymerase, share an extensively conserved 3'----5' exonuclease motif. Therefore, extrapolation from E. coli DNA polymerase I sequence and structure to other DNA polymerases for which there is no structural information may not be valid.\r"

In eukaryotes, mitochondrial DNA is degraded by excess and futile DNA repair. Using x-ray crystallography, we have determined, to 1.7 A resolution, the three-dimensional structure of a complex of ditercalinium bound to the double-stranded DNA fragment [d(CGCG)]2. The DNA in the complex with ditercalinium is kinked (by 15 degrees) and severely unwound (by 36 degrees) with exceptionally wide major and minor grooves. Recognition of the DNA-ditercalinium complex by uvrABC in prokaryotes, and by mitochondrial DNA repair systems in eukaryotes, might be related to drug-induced distortion of the DNA helix.\r"

The opening reading frame in cDNA clone g11 corresponds to a predicted protein of 242 amino acids. Quox-1 protein displays high sequence similarity to the Antennapedia family, especially to the mouse homeodomain-containing protein Hox-1.1 (100% identity in the homeobox region, 77% at the 5' end beyond the homeobox). However, the carboxyl-terminal domain of the postulated protein has no significant homology with other known homeoproteins, including Hox-1.1. In situ hybridization experiments showed that Quox-1 is widely expressed in the developing central nervous system including the entire brain and the spinal cord. Outside the central nervous system, transcription of Quox-1 was mainly detected in the endoderm-derived epithelium of esophagus, trachea, and other digestive organs, as well as in the sensory epithelium of the olfactory region and perichondrium of the vertebrae. Thus, Quox-1 transcripts have a remarkably wide distribution that, unlike the other vertebrate homeobox genes examined to date, encompasses the rostral part of the developing nervous system, including the forebrain.\r"

  ".U": "91172824\r", 
  ".W": "Although commonly used to control a variety of inflammatory diseases, the mechanism of action of a low dose of methotrexate remains a mystery. Methotrexate accumulates intracellularly where it may interfere with purine metabolism. Therefore, we determined whether a 48-hr pretreatment with methotrexate affected adenosine release from [14C]adenine-labeled human fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells. Methotrexate significantly increased adenosine release by fibroblasts from 4 +/- 1% to 31 +/- 6% of total purine released (EC50, 1 nM) and by endothelial cells from 24 +/- 4% to 42 +/- 7%. Methotrexate-enhanced adenosine release from fibroblasts was further increased to 51 +/- 4% (EC50, 6 nM) and from endothelial cells was increased to 58 +/- 5% of total purine released by exposure to stimulated (fMet-Leu-Phe at 0.1 microM) neutrophils. The effect of methotrexate on adenosine release was not due to cytotoxicity since cells treated with maximal concentrations of methotrexate took up [14C]adenine and released 14C-labeled purine (a measure of cell injury) in a manner identical to control cells. Methotrexate treatment of fibroblasts dramatically inhibited adherence to fibroblasts by both unstimulated neutrophils (IC50, 9 nM) and stimulated neutrophils (IC50, 13 nM). Methotrexate treatment inhibited neutrophil adherence by enhancing adenosine release from fibroblasts since digestion of extracellular adenosine by added adenosine deaminase completely abrogated the effect of methotrexate on neutrophil adherence without, itself, affecting adherence. One hypothesis that explains the effect of methotrexate on adenosine release is that, by inhibition of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase, methotrexate induces the accumulation of AICAR, the nucleoside precursor of which (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside referred to hereafter as acadesine) has previously been shown to cause adenosine release from ischemic cardiac tissue. We found that acadesine also promotes adenosine release from and inhibits neutrophil adherence to connective tissue cells. The observation that the antiinflammatory actions of methotrexate are due to the capacity of methotrexate to induce adenosine release may form the basis for the development of an additional class of antiinflammatory drugs.\r"

  ".U": "91172825\r", 
  ".W": "The major function of the regulatory (R) subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is to bind tightly to the catalytic (C) subunit to form an inactive holoenzyme in the absence of cAMP. The hinge region of the R subunit resembles the substrate recognition site for the C subunit and is known to be involved in the R.C subunit interaction. Two arginine residues in this region, Arg-92 and Arg-93, are suggested to be essential for holoenzyme formation. In this study, a mutant in which Arg-92 and Arg-93 of type II regulatory subunit (RII) were replaced with alanine was constructed. Formation of the holoenzyme from mutant RII and C subunits was analyzed by gel-filtration and cation-exchange chromatography. Mutant RII in its cAMP-free form formed a stable holoenzyme with the C subunit, which dissociated in the presence of cAMP. Interestingly, the holoenzyme formed from mutant RII and C subunits retained full enzymatic activity even in the absence of cAMP. Although mutant RII could no longer be phosphorylated by the C subunit, the rate of [3H]cAMP release from mutant RII.cAMP was increased by addition of the C subunit, indicating that C-induced cAMP release is not the result of the interaction of the C subunit with the hinge region. These results demonstrate that Arg-92 and Arg-93 are not essential for holoenzyme formation but are critical for inhibiting kinase activity in the holoenzyme probably by occupying the substrate binding site. The results suggest that, in addition to the hinge region, a second site on the RII subunit may interact with the C subunit in a cAMP-dependent manner.\r"

The sequence (9379 nucleotides) has a single large open reading frame that could encode a viral polyprotein precursor of 3011 amino acids. While there as little overall amino acid and nucleotide sequence homology with other viruses, the 5' HCV nucleotide sequence upstream of this large open reading frame has substantial similarity to the 5' termini of pestiviral genomes. The polyprotein also has significant sequence similarity to helicases encoded by animal pestiviruses, plant potyviruses, and human flaviviruses, and it contains sequence motifs widely conserved among viral replicases and trypsin-like proteases. A basic, presumed nucleocapsid domain is located at the N terminus upstream of a region containing numerous potential N-linked glycosylation sites. These HCV domains are located in the same relative position as observed in the pestiviruses and flaviviruses and the hydrophobic profiles of all three viral polyproteins are similar. These combined data indicate that HCV is an unusual virus that is most related to the pestiviruses. Significant genome diversity is apparent within the putative 5' structural gene region of different HCV isolates, suggesting the presence of closely related but distinct viral genotypes.\r"

It is a homologue of beta-lactoglobulin, a retinol binding protein, but unlike beta-lactoglobulin it is not found in the mammary gland. The cloning and sequencing of 34 alpha 2-PEG clones has revealed several minor variant forms indicative of alternatively spliced alpha 2-PEG pre-mRNA. These minor forms have also been detected amongst uncloned cDNA after PCR amplification. Some of these mRNAs would give rise to forms of alpha 2-PEG protein lacking internal sequences, whereas others affect the mRNA sequences on the 3' boundary of the presumed termination codon. Sequences within the cDNA clones are consistent with the existence of splice sites, and together with similarities found between alpha 2-PEG cDNA and beta-lactoglobulin gene sequences there is good evidence in support of an unusual scheme for the alternative splicing of alpha 2-PEG pre-mRNA involving both alternative 5' splice sites and alternative 3' splice sites. This scheme suggests that the alpha 2-PEG and beta-lactoglobulin genes share a similar structure in at least two regions, and it is likely that beta-lactoglobulin pre-mRNA would show a similar pattern of alternative splicing for one of these regions.\r"

The calcium-release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum from the interventricular septum has a smaller conductance (31 pS vs. 100 pS) and has longer open and closed times when compared with the channel from left-ventricular free wall. An additional calcium-permeable channel with an even smaller conductance (17 pS) was found in the septum, and this channel is similar to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-gated channel from smooth muscle and different from the calcium-release channel (ryanodine receptor) from skeletal and cardiac muscle. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-activated channel may be derived from specialized conducting tissue that is relatively abundant in the septum, whereas the other calcium-release channels may be derived from regionally specialized myocardial cells in the septum and free wall.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have described a dicationic anticarcinoma agent that can chemically assemble in situ from monocationic phosphonium salts. The chemical combination of these monocationic precursors in the micromolar concentration range, occurring after their uptake by cells, was probably responsible for their synergistic inhibition of cell growth and for their selective cytotoxicity to Ehrlich ascites murine carcinoma cells relative to untransformed epithelial cells. Here, we report that the dicationic product that forms in this assembly reaction is an in vitro inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha and beta 1 isoforms, exhibiting IC50 values of 20.4 microM and 35 microM, respectively. The monocationic precursors proved to be much weaker inhibitors of PKC (IC50 values greater than 200 microM). When PKC is exposed to combinations of the two precursors, the enzymatic activity decreases steadily as a function of time. Using dose-response data and HPLC kinetic studies, we show that when the two precursor compounds are added as a combination to PKC under these conditions, the rate of formation of the inhibitory product follows the observed time course of decline in PKC activity under identical conditions. We discuss the possibility that antiproliferative effects against carcinoma cells of the preformed dication and of the combined monocationic precursors involve inhibition of PKC.\r"

The domain of the A protein is a highly stable monomer in solution consisting of four antiparallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices. The highly conserved RNP1 and RNP2 consensus sequences, containing residues previously suggested to be involved in nucleic acid binding, are juxtaposed in adjacent beta-strands. Conserved aromatic side chains that are critical for RNA binding are clustered on the surface of the molecule adjacent to a variable loop that influences recognition of specific RNA sequences. The secondary structure and topology of the RRM are similar to those of ribosomal proteins L12 and L30, suggesting a distant evolutionary relationship between these two types of RNA-associated proteins.\r"

Herein, the phoA promoter without its associated signal peptide is used to regulate expression of the HPRT of Schistosoma mansoni and the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.17) of Trypanosoma brucei, two enzymes that have been identified as potential targets for antiparasitic chemotherapy. The levels of recombinant expression range from 20% to 60% of the total bacterial protein, and the majority of both recombinant enzymes was soluble. The specific activity for the recombinant trypanosomal ODC was one-third to two-thirds that of the authentic native enzyme and yields were predicted to be 15-30 mg of active enzyme per liter of bacterial culture. The specific activity for the recombinant schistosomal HPRT was equivalent to that for the native enzyme purified from schistosomes and up to 10 mg of enzymatically active HPRT has been purified from a 0.5-liter culture of treated bacteria. These results represent a break-through in recombinant expression of HPRT and ODC.\r"

The murine MARCKS cDNA clone encodes an acidic protein of 309 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 29,661. Transfection of the murine MARCKS gene into TK-L fibroblasts produced a myristoylated protein kinase C substrate that migrated on SDS/PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa. Peptide mapping studies indicated that MARCKS produced by the transfected gene was indistinguishable from the endogenous murine macrophage protein. Comparison of the murine macrophage sequence with the previously published chicken and bovine brain sequences revealed two conserved domains: an N-terminal membrane-binding domain and a phosphorylation domain that also contains calmodulin and actin binding sites. In murine peritoneal macrophages, bacterial lipopolysaccharide increased MARCKS mRNA levels by greater than 30-fold. Multiple MARCKS transcripts were observed and could be accounted for by differential polyadenylylation and incomplete processing. Genomic Southern blot analysis suggested a single MARCKS gene per haploid genome.\r"

The nucleotide sequence of the castor clone pRCD1 revealed an open reading frame of 1.2 kilobases encoding a 396-amino acid protein of 45 kDa. The cucumber clone pCSD1 encoded a homologous 396-amino acid protein with 88% amino acid identity to the castor clone. Expression of pRCD1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in the accumulation of a functional stearoyl-ACP desaturase, demonstrating that the introduction of this single gene product was sufficient to confer soluble desaturase activity to yeast. There was no detectable identity between the deduced amino acid sequences of the castor delta 9-stearoyl-ACP desaturase and either the delta 9-stearoyl-CoA desaturase from rat or yeast or the delta 12 desaturase from Synechocystis, suggesting that these enzymes may have evolved independently. However, there was a 48-residue region of 29% amino acid sequence identity between residues 53 and 101 of the castor desaturase and the proximal border of the dehydratase region of the fatty acid synthase from yeast. Stearoyl-ACP mRNA was present at substantially higher levels in developing seeds than in leaf and root tissue, suggesting that expression of the delta 9 desaturase is developmentally regulated.\r"

This element contains three binding sites for a bean nuclear factor (SBF-1) with DNA sequence recognition properties that are very similar to those of nuclear factor GT-1. By using a synthetic tetramer of one of the binding sites as probe, we have purified sequence-specific SBF-1 activity approximately 1750-fold from suspension-cell nuclei, by using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, heparin-agarose chromatography, and sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography. The factor exhibited an apparent molecular weight of 160,000-200,000 on the basis of gel filtration. A subunit molecular weight of approximately 95,000 was determined from SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of purified fractions, followed by Southwestern blot analysis (a protein blot probed with oligonucleotide probes), and from UV-cross-linking experiments.

  ".U": "91172840\r", 
  ".W": "In mammals, glucose transport is mediated by five structurally related glucose transporters that show a characteristic cell-specific expression. However, the rat brain/HepG2/erythrocyte-type glucose transporter GLUT-1 is expressed at low levels in most cells. The reason for this coexpression is not clear. GLUT-1 is negatively regulated by glucose. Another family of proteins, glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs), is also ubiquitously expressed and stimulated by glucose deprivation and other cellular stresses. We therefore hypothesized that GLUT-1 may be a glucose-regulated stress protein. This was tested by subjecting L8 myocytes and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts to glucose starvation or exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187, 2-mercaptoethanol, or tunicamycin, all known to increase GRP levels. The mRNA for GLUT-1 was augmented by 50-300% in a time-dependent manner, similarly to the changes in GRP-78 mRNA. Ex vivo incubation of rat soleus muscles induced a marked and concomitant rise in the mRNA levels of GLUT-1 and GRP-78. Finally, calcium ionophore A23187 and 2-mercaptoethanol induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in the levels of the GLUT-1 protein and hexose uptake. In all instances in which GRP-78 and GLUT-1 responded to stress, the transcription of the cell-specific muscle/adipocyte-type insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT-4) did not change. Thus, despite the lack of structural similarity, GLUT-1 and GRP-78 expression is regulated similarly, whereas the regulation of GLUT-4, which is structurally related to GLUT-1, is different. We propose that GLUT-1 belongs to the GRP family of stress proteins and that its ubiquitous expression may serve a specific purpose during cellular stress.\r"

GM979, unlike previously used murine erythroleukemia cell lines, expresses murine embryonic globin in addition to adult globin. While all the hybrids expressed gamma- and beta-globin, they displayed a wide range of gamma-globin expression in relation to that of beta-globin. No correlation, however, was found in quantitative expression between murine embryonic globin and human gamma-globin in these hybrids, suggesting that the two globins are regulated independently, at least in this cell line. These data indicate that gamma-globin genes from normal, nonerythroid chromosomes are not irreversibly silenced, and they can be activated by a positive trans factor(s) present in GM979 cells.\r"

We report here that pretreatment of erythropoietin-responsive murine erythroleukemia cells with chemical inducers resulted in a striking increase in erythropoietin-specific hemoglobinization. This amplification of the erythropoietin biologic response was accompanied by the induction of a new population of high-density receptors (approximately 20,000 per cell) exhibiting marked positive cooperativity. Erythropoietin binding to new receptors displayed a convex upward Scatchard plot and a Hill coefficient (nH) of 6.75. Measurement of erythropoietin receptor mRNA demonstrated an initial decrease in receptor transcript followed by an approximately 2- to 3-fold increase after 24-48 hr. This increase in receptor message does not appear to account for the magnitude of the receptor up-regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide. We propose that this positive cooperativity reflects the interaction (clustering) of receptors, presumably through the formation of homooligomers or heterooligomers, and that this receptor interaction may amplify the erythropoietin signal transduction pathway.\r"

The phenotypic expression of these loci can be easily recognized early in embryonic development by observation through the transparent egg membrane. We irradiated wild-type males with 137Cs gamma-rays to determine the dose-response relationships for dominant lethal and specific-locus mutations induced in sperm, spermatids, and spermatogonia. Through observation of 322,666 loci in control offspring and 374,026 loci in offspring obtained from 0.64-, 4.75-, or 9.50-Gy-irradiated gametes, specific-locus mutations were phenotypically detected during early development. These putative mutations, designated \"total mutation,\" can be recognized only in embryos of oviparous animals. The developmental fate of these mutant embryos was precisely followed. During subsequent embryonic development, a large fraction died and thus was unavailable for test-crossing, which was used to identify \"viable mutations.\" Our medaka SLT system demonstrates that the vast majority of total mutations is associated with dominant lethal mutations. Thus far only one spontaneous viable mutation has been observed, so that all doubling calculations involving this endpoint carry a large error. With these reservations, however, we conclude that the quantitative data so far obtained from the medaka SLT are quite comparable to those from the mouse SLT and, hence, indicate the validity of the medaka SLT as a possible nonmammalian test system.\r"

In Northern blot experiments, the earliest expression of the T11.15 transcript was detected in the thymus at embryonic day 10 (i.e., 1 day after cytoplasmic expression of a CD3 epitope recognized by a specific monoclonal antibody [CT3; Chen, C.L.H., Ager, L.L., Gartland, G.L. & Cooper, M.D. (1986) J. Exp. Med. 164, 375-380], but 2 days before the appearance of clonotypic components of the T-cell antigen receptor). Sequence similarity of this chicken protein sequence compared with that of the known mammalian CD3 gamma and delta polypeptides was 36-39% and 39-40%, respectively. Amino acid sequence alignments between avian and mammalian CD3 revealed maximum conservation in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains as well as in the regions flanking the cysteine residues in the extracellular domain, underlining their functional importance. The difficulty of unambiguously assigning this chain to a single mammalian CD3 subunit on the basis of sequence comparison raises the possibility that this polypeptide represents a derivative from an ancestral form of the gamma and delta chains. It is thus possible that a single chain may play the role of both CD3 gamma and delta subunits in the chicken CD3 complex or, alternatively, that gene duplications occurred independently in the avian and mammalian lineages.\r"

Here, we have cloned the cDNA coding for the precursor protein of the sea anemone neuropeptide (Antho-RFamide) less than Glu-Gly-Arg-Phe-NH2. This precursor is 334 amino acids in length and contains 19 copies of unprocessed Antho-RFamide (Gln-Gly-Arg-Phe-Gly), which are tandemly arranged in the C-terminal part of the protein. Paired basic residues (Lys-Arg) or single basic residues (Arg) occur at the C-terminal side of each Antho-RFamide sequence. These are likely signals for posttranslational cleavage. The processing signals at the N-terminal side of each Antho-RFamide sequence, however, include acidic residues. Processing at these amino acids must involve either an amino- or an endopeptidase that cleaves C-terminally of aspartic acid or glutamic acid residues. Such processing is, to our knowledge, hitherto unknown for peptidergic neurons. The Antho-RFamide precursor also contains two copies of the putative Antho-RFamide-related peptide Phe-Gln-Gly-Arg-Phe-NH2 and one copy of Tyr-Val-Pro-Gly-Arg-Tyr-NH2. In addition, the precursor protein harbors four other putative neuropeptides that are much less related to Antho-RFamide. This report shows that the biosynthetic machinery for neuropeptides in coelenterates, the lowest animal group having a nervous system, is already very efficient and similar to that of higher invertebrates, such as mollusks and insects, and vertebrates.\r"

After intracellular loading with EGTA to block Ca2(+)-dependent chloride currents, these oocytes responded to 5-HT with an inward current associated with a decrease in membrane conductance. Membrane current responses were small or absent in oocytes injected with either mRNA alone. We conclude that 5-HT1C receptors are able to cause the closing of a class of K+ channels expressed by cortex mRNA in a Ca2(+)-independent manner. The coupling between the receptors and channels appears to be mediated by the inositol phospholipid second messenger pathway, since activation of this pathway by application of serum evoked a similar closing current.\r"

Applying this method to a purified protein, we could detect as little as 63 fg (0.9 amol) of biotinylated bovine serum albumin. The sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by the detection of proteins from individual photoreceptor outer segments, including proteins constituting approximately 1% of the total. Chemiluminescence detection also proved extremely sensitive for immunoblotting: a comparison of five methods for detection of antibody-antigen interactions showed that the AMPPD technique was more sensitive than detection with a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase substrate, 125I-labeled protein A, 125I-labeled anti-mouse IgG, or colloidal gold-conjugated anti-mouse IgG.\r"

  ".W": "Rhodopsin kinase (RK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of rhodopsin (Rho) as one of the steps in quenching photoactivated Rho. In this work, we investigated the autophosphorylation of RK and how it affects the interaction between RK and Rho. RK undergoes intramolecular phosphorylation, resulting in the incorporation of three or four phosphates per RK molecule. Phosphorylated RK subsequently is a substrate for protein phosphatases 2A and 2B. We isolated three forms of RK based on their differential interactions with heparin-Sepharose. Fully phosphorylated RK (alpha-RK) binds tightly to Rho but has significantly lower affinity to phosphorylated Rho, whereas unphosphorylated RK (gamma-RK) binds avidly to both forms of Rho. The heterogenous intermediately phosphorylated RK (beta-RK) was not studied. Our data support the hypothesis that RK dissociates from Rho when both Rho and RK become phosphorylated, thereby allowing the binding of arrestin to phosphorylated Rho. These results suggest that autophosphorylation plays an important role in regulating the binding of RK to Rho and that the binding sites of RK and arrestin overlap at least partially.\r"

  ".U": "91172849\r", 
  ".W": "Regulation of the cell cycle-controlled histone gene promoter factor HiNF-D was examined in vivo. Proliferative activity was measured by DNA replication-dependent histone mRNA levels, and HiNF-D binding activity was found to correlate with cell proliferation in most tissues. Furthermore, HiNF-D is down-regulated during hepatic development, reflecting the onset of differentiation and quiescence. The contribution of transcription to histone gene expression was directly addressed in transgenic mice by using a set of fusion constructs containing a human H4 histone gene promoter linked to three different genes. Transgene expression in both fetal and adult mice paralleled endogenous mouse histone mRNA levels in most tissues, consistent with this promoter conferring developmental, cell growth-related transcriptional regulation. Our results suggest that HiNF-D is stringently regulated in vivo in relation to cell growth and support a primary role for HiNF-D in the proliferation-specific expression of H4 histone genes in the intact animal. Further, the data presented here provide an example in which apparent tissue specificity of gene expression reflects the proliferative state of various tissues and demonstrate that multiple levels of histone gene regulation are operative in vivo.\r"

Stearoyl-ACP desaturase was purified from developing embryos of safflower seed, and extensive amino acid sequence was determined. The amino acid sequence was used in conjunction with polymerase chain reactions to clone a full-length cDNA. The primary structure of the protein, as deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA, includes a 33-amino-acid transit peptide not found in the purified enzyme. Expression in Escherichia coli of a gene encoding the mature form of stearoyl-ACP desaturase did not result in an altered fatty acid composition. However, active enzyme was detected when assayed in vitro with added spinach ferredoxin. The lack of significant activity in vitro without added ferredoxin and the lack of observed change in fatty acid composition indicate that ferredoxin is a required cofactor for the enzyme and that E. coli ferredoxin functions poorly, if at all, as an electron donor for the plant enzyme.\r"

We have used this reaction as a probe for changes in Schiff base reactivity during the photocycle of wild-type bR and mutants defective in proton transport. We report here that under illumination at pH 6, the D85N mutant has a 20-fold lower rate and the D212N mutant has a greater than 4-fold higher rate for the light-dependent reaction with hydroxylamine compared with wild-type bR. In contrast, the reactivities of wild-type bR and the D96N and T46V mutants are similar. It has been previously shown that the D96N and T46V replacements have no significant effect on the kinetics of \"M\" formation but have dramatic effects on rate of the decay of M. We therefore conclude that the hydroxylamine reaction occurs before formation of the M intermediate. Most likely it occurs at the \"L\" stage of the cycle and reflects increased water accessibility to the Schiff base due to a light-driven change in protein conformation.\r"

  ".W": "Differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes is accompanied by increased expression of the nuclear protein C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) and by transcriptional activation of a group of adipose-specific genes. We report here the isolation of the murine C/EBP gene and the characterization of its promoter. Consistent with its proposed role in coordinating transcription during preadipocyte differentiation, an increase in the rate of transcription of the C/EBP gene precedes that of several adipose-specific genes whose promoters are transactivated by C/EBP. DNase I cleavage-inhibition patterns (footprinting) of the C/EBP gene promoter by nuclear factors from differentiated and undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells identified two sites of differential factor binding. One site in the C/EBP gene promoter between nucleotides -252 and -239 binds a nuclear factor(s) present in preadipocytes that is lost or modified upon differentiation. Another site, between nucleotides -203 and -176, exhibits different but overlapping footprints by nuclear factors present in differentiated and undifferentiated cells. Gel retardation analysis with oligonucleotides corresponding to these sites revealed protein-oligonucleotide complexes containing these differentially expressed nuclear factors. The factor present in differentiated cells that binds at this site was identified as C/EBP (possibly in heterodimeric form with a homologous leucine-zipper protein), suggesting that C/EBP may regulate expression of its own gene.\r"

  ".W": "Thymopoietin, a polypeptide hormone of the thymus that has pleiotropic actions on the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems, potently interacts with the neuromuscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Thymopoietin binds to the nicotinic alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT) receptor in muscle and, like alpha-BGT, inhibits cholinergic transmission at this site. Evidence is given that radiolabeled thymopoietin similarly binds to a nicotinic alpha-BGT-binding site within the brain and does so with the characteristics of a specific receptor ligand. Thus specific binding to neuronal membranes was saturable, of high affinity (Kd = 8 nM), linear with increased tissue concentration, and readily reversible; half-time was approximately 5 min for association and 10 min for dissociation. Binding of 125I-labeled thymopoietin was displaced not only by unlabeled thymopoietin but also by alpha-BGT and the nicotinic receptor ligands d-tubocurarine and nicotine; various other receptor ligands (muscarinic, adrenergic, and dopaminergic) did not affect binding of 125I-labeled thymopoietin. Thymopoietin was shown by ELISA to be present in brain extracts, displacement curves of thymus and brain extracts being parallel to the standard thymopoietin curve, and Western (immuno) blot identified in brain and thymus extracts a thymopoietin-immunoreactive polypeptide of the same molecular mass as purified thymopoietin polypeptide. We conclude that thymopoietin and thymopoietin-binding sites are present within the brain and that the receptor for thymopoietin is the previously identified nicotinic alpha-BGT-binding site of neuronal tissue.\r"

In patients with nodular elevations of the mucosa, discrete plaques should suggest Candida esophagitis, whereas poorly defined nodules should suggest reflux esophagitis and a distinctive reticular pattern of the mucosa should suggest Barrett esophagus, particularly if adjacent to the distal aspect of a high stricture. In patients with ulceration, one or more shallow ulcers at or near the gastroesophageal junction should suggest reflux esophagitis, whereas discrete, superficial ulcers in the midesophagus should suggest herpes or drug-induced esophagitis, depending on the clinical setting. In contrast, one or more giant, relatively flat ulcers should suggest cytomegalovirus esophagitis, particularly in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Finally, thickened longitudinal folds may be caused by esophagitis, varices, or, rarely, \"varicoid\" carcinoma, but these conditions usually can be differentiated on radiologic grounds. By carefully analyzing the appearance and location of nodules, plaques, ulcers, or abnormal folds in the esophagus, one can usually suggest a cause of the disease.\r"

Of the 170 lesions that demonstrated findings consistent with calcification on preoperative mammograms and radiographs of specimens, 12 (7.1%) were not described by the pathologist as being calcified. These discrepancies were due to inadequate sampling in three cases (25%), lack of explicit description by the pathologist in four (33%), presence of oxalate crystals that required examination with polarizing lenses in two (17%), and unexplained loss of tissue probably related to processing in three (25%). Of the 121 lesions that did not demonstrate findings consistent with calcification at radiography, eight (6.6%) were described as calcified by the pathologist. The authors recommend a protocol for avoiding these discrepancies that involves performance of a more comprehensive examination of histologic sections by the pathologist, including the use of polarizing lenses, if necessary, and radiographic reexamination of paraffin-embedded tissue blocks with subsequent step sectioning by the pathologist when results are positive.\r"

The observers listed the three most likely diagnoses and recorded the degree of confidence they had in their choice on a 0%-100% probability scale. Findings at radiography and high-resolution CT were recorded by each observer and were used for a stepwise discriminant analysis between diagnoses. First-choice diagnoses of all three observers that were made with a high level of confidence (probability, greater than or equal to 75%) were more accurate with CT than with radiography (P less than .001). The superiority of high-resolution CT over radiography was most obvious for histiocytosis X and sarcoidosis; in cases of pulmonary fibrosis, CT was not significantly different from radiography. The interobserver agreement for the proposed diagnosis was significantly better with high-resolution CT (P less than .001). Twenty-one of 26 radiographic findings and 21 of 25 CT findings were discriminant. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed the superiority of CT over radiography, since the ranking of all findings showed that the four most discriminant findings, and eight of the first 12 findings, were revealed with CT.\r"

The contrast so obtained is theoretically different from T1 or T2 contrast and has been termed magnetization transfer contrast. Cat head images were acquired in vivo with this method at 4.7 and 1.5 T. Compared with conventional gradient-recalled-echo images, the magnetization transfer images demonstrate increased contrast between many tissue pairs, such as between white matter and blood and between gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The dependence of the magnetization transfer effect on repetition time and preirradiation power were also studied.\r"

Once such displacements were estimated from the image data, motion correction proceeded with use of the same algorithm used for the navigator echoes.

Using a carefully designed and experimentally validated Monte Carlo simulation, the authors found that average glandular dose also depends on x-ray tube voltage and, to a lesser extent, on x-ray tube voltage waveform. For currently employed molybdenum target-molybdenum filter source assemblies, a difference in dose of 10% or more is possible in estimating the average glandular dose obtained with different x-ray tube voltages but with the same HVL. Presented are normalized average glandular tissue doses in units of radiation absorbed dose per unit entrance skin exposure for different tube voltages and tube voltage waveforms as well as for different breast thicknesses and compositions and beam filtrations.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed to characterize phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectra obtained from 10 superficial human tumors outside the brain and to determine whether P-31 MR spectroscopy could allow detection of a response to therapy before a change in tumor size was measured. The ratio of phosphomonoester to adenosine triphosphate peak intensities (PME/ATP) was unusually large in all tumors studied. The average PME/ATP in lymphomas (1.8 +/- 0.5) was greater than in nonlymphoma cancers (1.1 +/- 0.15). The average PME/ATP for all tumors studied (1.4 +/- 0.5) was much greater than that of underlying skeletal muscle (0.23 +/- .09). Eight of the tumors were studied before and after therapy. Responders were distinguished from nonresponders on the basis of changes in tumor size. PME/ATP decreased during therapy in three lymphomas that responded to therapy. In an adenocarcinoma and Ewing sarcoma that did not respond to therapy, PME/ATP increased. PME/ATP remained constant in two squamous cell carcinomas that responded to therapy and decreased in one squamous cell carcinoma that decreased in size by 40% but was classified as a nonresponder. Changes in PME/ATP did not always parallel changes in tumor size during therapy. In two patients, a decrease in PME/ATP preceded a decrease in tumor size. In four patients, PME/ATP increased transiently during periods when tumor size remained constant.\r"

The predictive value of a supraclavicular node indicating metastases was .74 at US and .85 at CT. Metastases were diagnosed in 10 of 46 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (22%) and five of 50 patients (10%) with adenocarcinoma. Nodes with metastases had a round configuration, with a statistically significant greater short-axis to long-axis ratio than that of benign nodes (0.89 vs 0.54; P = .05). In four of 16 patients (25%) with supraclavicular metastases proved with cytologic examination, neither CT nor US of the mediastinum and abdomen showed enlarged nodes.\r"

The intra- and inter-observer and intra- and interpatient variations in the measurements of the anorectal angle, position of the anorectal junction, and position of the plica of Kohlrausch in the rectum were established at rest, during perineal contraction, and during straining. The values for the anorectal angle and position of the anorectal junction obtained with MR imaging were compared with standard radiography defecography findings. It was shown that MR imaging has the potential for measuring these parameters in a more precise and more patient-friendly way than defecography. Unlike dynamic defecography, MR imaging is able to depict the mobility of the posterior rectal wall. A descent of over 20 mm from rest to straining should be considered pathologic. This finding might play a role in patient selection for operation.\r"

Overall, the accuracy of staging rectal and colonic carcinomas with TES was 81% and 93%, respectively; overstaging occurred in 13% and understaging in 2%. For regional lymph nodes, the accuracy of staging with TES was 70%, the sensitivity was 94%, and the specificity was 55%. Correlations between findings at TES and the Dukes classification were as follows: for rectal carcinoma, 48% for class A, 50% for class B, and 96% for class C; for colonic carcinoma, 67% for class A, 46% for class B, and 91% for class C. Overall accuracy was 67%. With the addition of abdominal computed tomographic or ultrasonographic examinations to evaluate distant metastases, TES should become an important imaging technique for clinical TNM staging of colorectal carcinomas.\r"

Among 71 cases, only 20 were diagnosed preoperatively by means of US. US patterns of the lesions were also classified into four types: fungating mass, lumen filling, smooth raised, and thickening of mucosa. US features corresponded well to the macroscopic forms. No flat lesion was identified preoperatively. For early detection of carcinoma of the gallbladder, it seemed essential to pay careful attention to mild mucosal change, as more than 50% of early cancers did not show apparently protruding lesions.\r"

Five of six patients with gallbladder varices had portal vein thrombosis. Anechoic areas within the gallbladder wall detected with ultrasonography could be distinguished from intramural edema by using duplex or color Doppler flow imaging in all five patients in whom it was used. Contrast material enhancement of these varices was detected with CT in three patients, two of whom also had adjacent mesenteric collaterals. Gradient-echo MR imaging (fast imaging in steady precession/fast low-angle shot) showed flow-related enhancement within the gallbladder wall in two patients. The presence of gallbladder wall varices may imply the presence of portal vein thrombosis. Since these varices can be a source of major blood loss, surgeons must be made aware of them when operating on patients with portal hypertension.\r"

T2 relaxation times of extraocular muscles and orbital fat, areas of extraocular muscles, and degree of exophthalmos were measured by means of MR imaging at the beginning, at the end, and 3 months after completion of radiation therapy. As a result, patients with primarily elevated T2 times of extraocular muscles showed a better therapy response regarding muscle thickening than patients with primarily normal T2 times. Elevated T2 times, which probably represent acute inflammatory changes, were markedly decreased at the end of therapy. Therefore, quantitative MR imaging favors the choice of anti-inflammatory therapy regimens in patients with elevated T2 times of extraocular muscles. However, the clinical response (activity scores) to the low-dose treatment protocol that was used did not correlate well with primarily elevated T2 times. Furthermore, T2 times increased again after cessation of therapy. Whether a higher radiation dose or a different fractionation scheme leads to better results must be clarified by means of further study.\r"

One conclusion in the source articles was that no differences were seen between the two groups of contrast media in frequency of nausea, vomiting, and urticaria. However, the LOM group included both nonionic LOM (NIM) and the ionic contrast medium ioxaglate. The authors found that various complications associated with the use of contrast media were much less common with NIM than with HOM; statistically this lower frequency is highly significant. This difference was obscured in the previous studies by the pooling of RCTs in which the less toxic NIM were used and RCTs in which the more toxic ionic contrast medium ioxaglate was used.\r"

Enhancing lesions may be obscured either by proximity to fat or by chemical misregistration artifact. The authors evaluated the role of a gadolinium-enhanced fat suppression imaging technique in the detection of extracranial head and neck abnormalities in 29 patients. These studies were directly compared with conventional pre- and postcontrast T1- and T2-weighted SE sequences. In detecting and defining the extent of abnormalities, fat-suppressed images were superior to non-fat-suppressed gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images in the majority of cases (22 of 27 [81%]). Fat-suppressed images were particularly beneficial in the detection of perineural spread of tumor as well as in defining lesions situated within or adjacent to fat-containing areas such as the base of the skull. These findings demonstrate that fat suppression techniques in combination with gadolinium enhancement are of value in extracranial head and neck imaging and should replace conventional postcontrast T1-weighted SE imaging.\r"

The most commonly used method to identify the gyri depends on recognition of the central sulcus by surface arrangement of the sulci. The two methods were compared by analysis of CT images of 104 subjects who had normal findings (age range, newborn to 60 years; 57 males and 47 females). The usefulness of the new method was also determined in angiographic studies of nine patients with space-occupying lesions. The method is especially helpful for identification of gyri on the lower level of the centrum semiovale and if space-occupying lesions are present that may result in a blurred depiction of sulci. Since MR imaging depicts the medullary branches more clearly than does CT, this new method should facilitate identification of the gyri with either modality.\r"

As a group, scans of SDAT subjects showed greater atrophy than those of control subjects in all volumetric indexes at each time of testing and demonstrated greater progression of atrophy during the study period.

Cerebral injury was assessed in vivo with a combination of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy for 5-12 hours after occlusion and was compared with the area of histochemically ischemic brain tissue. Compared with infarcts in placebo-treated animals, infarcts in cats given RS-87476 were reduced by an average of 70% at the lowest dose, 75% at the intermediate dose, and 88% at the highest dose. Tissue edema, observed as areas of signal hyperintensity on diffusion- and T2-weighted spin-echo images, was confined to small regions of the parietal cortex and basal ganglia in drug-treated animals. Mean plasma levels of RS-87476 at the lowest dose were 13 ng/mL initially, falling to maintenance levels of 3-5 ng/mL; at the intermediate and highest doses, plasma levels of drug were approximately five- and 20-fold greater. The drug was only slightly hypotensive. At least part of the potent cerebroprotective effects of RS-87476 result from its ability to stabilize metabolic energy reserves, reduce lactate formation in ischemic tissues, and attenuate intracerebral edema.\r"

Twenty-five patients under 40 years of age with proliferative retinopathy and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 10 age-matched control subjects were studied with MR imaging. Axial images were reviewed by two neuroradiologists for the presence of white matter foci of high signal intensity. No patients demonstrated evidence of these foci. There was no evidence of ischemic foci in any of the patients (all patients were neurologically asymptomatic). The vasculopathy associated with proliferative retinopathy does not appear to affect the intracranial circulation to the extent detectable with MR imaging. The presence of white matter foci of high signal intensity or ischemic changes in the brains of insulin-dependent diabetic patients under 40 years of age should not be attributed to diabetic vasculopathy. Other causes should be considered.\r"

The addition of MCJ and DRUJ injections to the standard RCJ injection significantly improved diagnostic yield. In 78 (26%) of the 300 cases, the abnormality was found after MCJ or DRUJ injections alone. Of the 103 triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) abnormalities identified, 27 (26%) could be demonstrated after DRUJ injection alone. Of the 145 abnormal RCJ and MCJ communications, 42 (29%) could be seen after MCJ injection alone. Similarly, 22 (15%) of the 145 abnormal RCJ and MCJ communications were seen after RCJ injection alone and would have been missed if only MCJ injection had been performed. Thus, three separate injections into the RCJ, MCJ, and DRUJ are necessary for complete arthrographic evaluation.\r"

MR imaging enabled accurate prediction of anterior labral tears, with a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 86%, and an accuracy of 92%. MR imaging was less effective in the prediction of tears of the superior labrum, with a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 99%, and an accuracy of 95%. These two categories accounted for the majority of the surgically correctable disease. MR imaging was found to be unreliable in the prediction of posterior (sensitivity, 7.7%) or inferior (sensitivity, 40%) labral tears, isolated cases of which occurred in only two (2%) of those undergoing surgery. MR imaging proved to be a highly accurate, noninvasive technique for the clinical evaluation of shoulder instability.\r"

STIR sequences enabled detection of all 45 lesions; 44 were detected with the SE sequence. Tumor appeared most conspicuous on STIR images in 35 patients (78%) and was most conspicuous on SE images in 10 patients (22%). Peritumoral brightening, which indicated either peritumoral edema or microscopic tumor infiltration, was detected in 20 patients but was detected only with STIR sequences in nine patients. It is concluded that, although STIR and SE sequences are comparable for lesion detection in the extremities, most lesions appear more conspicuous with STIR. STIR may enable detection of a greater volume of abnormality than SE sequences and may therefore have important implications for local staging and surgical and radiation therapy planning.\r"

Twenty-six women with signs and symptoms suggesting pelvic prolapse and 16 control subjects were studied with a series of fast (6-12-second) MR images. Sagittal and coronal images were obtained with graded increase in voluntary pelvic strain, allowing for dynamic display and quantification of the pelvic prolapse process. The distance from the pubococcygeal line was used as an internal reference for measurement of descent in the maximal strain position. With use of control results for normal limit values, prolapse involving the anterior pelvic compartment (cystocele), the middle compartment (vaginal prolapse, uterine prolapse, and enterocele), and the posterior compartment (rectocele) was easily demonstrated. Significant differences between control subjects and patients with prolapse were seen at maximal strain but not in the relaxed state. Quantification of the pelvic descent process with use of fast MR imaging may be of value in surgical planning and postsurgical follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "The current study tested the concept that cine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy might be used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the functional and metabolic status of the myocardium in humans. Thirteen patients with congestive cardiomyopathy and eight healthy volunteers were imaged at 1.5 T with the one-dimensional chemical shift imaging technique for localization of P-31 MR spectroscopy and an electrocardiographically referenced gradient refocused sequence for imaging of the heart. Prominent peaks in the PDE and PME regions were observed in cardiomyopathic patients, but only the former peak was measured. The PCr/beta-ATP peak ratio was not significantly lower in cardiomyopathic patients compared with healthy subjects (1.51 +/- 0.08 vs 1.54 +/- 0.04). The ratios of PDE/PCr (0.80 +/- 0.07 vs 0.54 +/- 0.10) (P less than or equal to .01) and PDE/beta-ATP (1.19 +/- 0.10 vs 0.84 +/- 0.08) (P less than or equal to .05) were significantly higher in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy compared with healthy volunteers. Left ventricular systolic wall thickening was significantly lower and left ventricular peak and end-systolic wall stress and mass were significantly higher in cardiomyopathic patients compared with healthy volunteers. Thus, localized, gated P-31 MR spectroscopy combined with cine MR imaging allowed identification of both abnormal myocardial phosphate metabolism and abnormal ventricular function. While this study suggests that increased myocardial PDEs may be a marker for abnormal myocardium, the sensitivity and specificity of this marker need to be further evaluated.\r"

The authors describe an asymmetric short-echo velocity-compensated 3D TOF technique that minimized the effects of physiologic motion on image quality and provided rapid high-resolution 3D MR arteriograms of the abdomen and thorax. Contiguous 3D volumes were often combined to provide sufficient anatomic coverage. Benefits include high spatial resolution and minimization of signal loss; limitations include sensitivity to motion artifact and progressive spin saturation.\r"

Graphic information on blood flow in the portal vein was acquired by using presaturation bolus tracking. Correlative duplex ultrasound (US) was performed in 28 patients, and surgical or autopsy correlation was available in all cases. MR angiography demonstrated patency of the portal vein in 26 (96%) of 27 patients, made possible the diagnosis of portal venous occlusion in three of three patients, depicted reversed portal flow in one patient, and provided clear delineation of the extent of varices and specific portosystemic collateral vessels. When duplex US was successful, there was full agreement with MR angiographic results in assessing portal vein patency and flow direction. All of the MR findings were corroborated at surgical exploration or autopsy. The authors conclude that MR angiography is very accurate in the portal system and is valuable in preoperative assessment for liver transplantation.\r"

By means of this technique, gallbladder malignancy was confirmed in 69 of the 78 cases of malignancy (88.5%). Ten of 10 benign lesions were properly categorized. One patient developed bile peritonitis following a single needle pass with the transperitoneal approach. Pain, a minor complication of the procedure, was noted in four cases. No instances of hemorrhage or vasovagal reactions occurred. From their experience in this large series, the authors conclude that US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of gallbladder masses is a safe, reliable, and accurate technique for the diagnosis of malignancy.\r"

In 10 animals, including eight with in vitro thrombi and two with in situ thrombi, thrombi were efficiently trapped with the clot-trapper device. In two animals, pulmonary embolism occurred because of a discrepancy between the diameter of the inferior vena cava and the diameter of the bag opening. After increasing the size of the loop to match the diameter of the inferior vena cava, trapping of all thrombi was possible in both experiments (acute and chronic thrombosis). The clot-trapper device, in conjunction with an embolectomy balloon catheter and/or a mechanical thrombectomy device, facilitates the removal of thrombi from the inferior vena cava and iliac veins.\r"

Of nine tumors that were not detected prospectively at TRUS, eight were predominantly in the anterior zone and one was in the posterior peripheral zone but was isoechoic. Overall, the sensitivity of TRUS in the evaluation of clinical stage A lesions was 55% and the specificity was 37%. Clinical stage A carcinomas may be difficult to detect at US, and findings are often nonspecific. Any suspicious peripheral zone lesion should undergo biopsy with TRUS guidance before being diagnosed as malignant.\r"

All US-guided biopsies were performed within 3 months after the most recent conventional biopsy. In 44 patients (39.3%) with negative results of conventional biopsies, the results of US-guided biopsy revealed cancer. The transrectal and transperineal digitally guided biopsies were equally inaccurate, and the transrectal and transperineal US-guided biopsies showed no statistically significant differences in accuracy. The patients accepted and tolerated both US techniques equally well; neither technique was associated with significant complications. It is concluded that all patients with a palpable nodule should undergo US-guided biopsy if the result of conventional digitally guided biopsy is negative for cancer and the diagnostic US scan suggests an abnormality.\r"

With the three-point Dixon technique, three measurements of phase shift at 0, pi, and -pi between the fat and water resonances are employed. Compensation for B0 inhomogeneity leads to an error-free decomposition into water- and fat-proton images; an accurate B0 map is also created. The lack of chemical shift artifact in the water- and fat-selective MR images permits the application of narrow receive bandwidth for the creation of T2-weighted images with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The technique was applied in vivo with four healthy subjects, seven patients with prostatic carcinoma, and one patient with benign prostatic hypertrophy and compared with conventional T2-weighted imaging. The three-point technique yielded images with improved definition of normal intraprostatic structures and zonal anatomy and, in some cases of prostatic carcinoma, provided better visualization of extraprostatic spread of tumor.\r"

At the 95% confidence level, inverse prediction produced full-range values for a 40-cm3 model of 5.7, 16.0, 28.8, and 32.8 cm3 for planimetry, HWL, and the two ellipsoid techniques, respectively. Despite its superior accuracy, planimetry is not available on most ultrasound units, increases estimated clinical scanning time, requires additional equipment, and is difficult for a sole operator to perform. Although less accurate than planimetry, HWL is a rapid volume measurement technique that appears to be more accurate than ellipsoid software packages; its universal availability makes it practical for routine clinical use.\r"

  ".W": "A study of 45 patients with 51 cases of hemiscrotal inflammatory disease was done to determine the color Doppler ultrasonographic appearance of scrotal inflammatory disorders. The diagnosis was ultimately established by means of appropriate response to antibiotic treatment (47 cases) or surgery (four cases). In all cases, there was evidence of hyperemia: an increased number and concentration of detectable vessels in the affected portion of the scrotum. In 17 cases, the gray scale images were normal, and the only evidence of inflammation was the presence of hypervascularity. Abnormally decreased epididymal vascular resistance was detected in 14 cases of epididymitis; abnormally decreased testicular vascular resistance was detected in six cases of orchitis. Spontaneous venous flow was present in 18 patients. The authors conclude that color Doppler can demonstrate the hyperemic response to scrotal inflammatory disease and that, in the proper clinical setting, it can supplement the gray scale findings and increase diagnostic confidence.\r"

Each patient underwent initial MR imaging after allograft renal transplantation. Twenty-nine of these 40 patients (72%) also underwent subsequent follow-up MR imaging. Seventeen studies were obtained during episodes of ATN; 12 of these studies (71%) showed poor CMD. Eleven studies were obtained during episodes of acute rejection; eight of these studies (73%) showed poor CMD. In addition, six of seven studies (86%) showing various combinations of renal disease (ATN, acute rejection, chronic rejection, and cyclosporine toxicity) also showed poor CMD. Loss of CMD is reversible after improvement of ATN and acute rejection. Because loss of CMD is a nonspecific though sensitive sign reflecting renal transplant dysfunction, MR imaging is of limited value in the differentiation of ATN from acute rejection.\r"

The prevalence of pelvic infection or inflammation was significantly lower with ethiodized poppy-seed oil than with water-soluble media. All contrast media provided acceptable diagnostic image quality with regard to fallopian tubes, peritoneal spill, and intraperitoneal distribution. Visualization of the uterine cavity and ampullary rugae was significantly better with water-soluble media than with ethiodized poppy-seed oil, which was associated with a high conception rate and which the authors consider preferable for HSG.\r"

No differences in demographic parameters, infertility status, or diagnosis made with HSG were detected among the four contrast media groups. Significantly more patients became pregnant after HSG in the ethiodized poppy-seed oil group than in the three water-soluble contrast media groups (P less than .01). When only intrauterine pregnancies resulting in full-term births were considered, significant differences in pregnancy rates between the oil-soluble and the water-soluble contrast media groups became more obvious.

On pre- and/or postnatal sonograms, the obstructed genital tract was visualized in seven neonates as a large cystic pelvic-abdominal mass, which was the markedly distended urine-filled vagina. One neonate had multiple cystic masses, which resulted from an obstructed duplex genital tract. In one of the neonates with an obstructed cloaca, the anomaly was not diagnosed. The bladder was compressed by the distended vagina and was not visualized in five patients. A vaginal fluid-debris level in six patients was a key finding that distinguished the vagina from the bladder. Obstruction of the urinary tract was an associated feature. An obstructed uterovaginal anomaly with renal dysplasia and oligohydramnios on prenatal sonograms indicates a poor prognosis. Sonography contributes to the diagnosis of an obstructed genital tract and helps define the internal genital anatomy.\r"

When the sonogram demonstrated hematometrocolpos or hematocolpos, the lesion was due to an imperforate hymen (n = 1) or high, middle, or low transverse vaginal septum (n = 7). When the sonogram demonstrated a hematometra, the lesion was due to Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome with functioning uterine anlage(n) (n = 2), cervical dysgenesis (n = 1), and an obstructed uterine horn (n = 2). The presence and patency or absence of the cervix was established. Since the differentiation between a transverse vaginal septum, Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome with active anlagen, and cervical dysgenesis with absent vagina cannot be made clinically, sonography provides important presurgical information.\r"

The shape of the cartilaginous femoral head was well identified with MR imaging, but, with arthrography, less information could be obtained about the medial and lateral aspects of the cartilaginous capital epiphyses in nine and three cases, respectively. Thirteen children underwent surgery; remodeling and regained femoroacetabular congruity of the articular surfaces following derotation varus osteotomy was identified in seven of 10 who underwent repeat MR imaging. In addition, MR images and conventional radiographs of the hips were compared. The radiographically identifiable distribution of the bone necrosis of the capital epiphysis correlated well with that demonstrated on MR images. MR imaging is a valuable non-invasive procedure with which to obtain information about the status and treatment of the cartilaginous femoral head in children with LCPD.\r"

In all patients except patient 3 (an infant 8 months old), inorganic phosphate with phosphodiester was observed, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr), which are detectable in healthy brains, were not detected. In 22 of these 23 patients, cardiac death occurred within 7 days after clinical brain death, and in one infant 14 months old, cardiac death occurred 38 days after clinical brain death. In patient 3, ATP and PCr were detected with P-31 MR spectroscopy, and now, more than 20 months after brain death, cardiac death has not yet occurred. In children younger than age 5 years, P-31 MR spectroscopic findings were predictive of the patient's clinical outcome. These findings may help establish criteria for the diagnosis of brain death in children younger than age 5 years.\r"

In both autoimmune and nonautoimmune diabetes, this glucose transport is reduced as a consequence of down-regulation of the normal beta-cell transporter. In autoimmune diabetes, circulating immunoglobulins can further impair this glucose transport by inhibiting functionally intact transporters. Insights into mechanisms of the unresponsiveness of beta cells to hyperglycemia may improve the management and prevention of diabetes.\r"

The carboxyl terminus of Myc family proteins contains a basic region helix-loop-helix leucine zipper motif (bHLH-Zip), which has DNA-binding activity and has been predicted to mediate protein-protein interactions. The bHLH-Zip region of c-Myc was used to screen a complementary DNA (cDNA) expression library, and a bHLH-Zip protein, termed Max, was identified. Max specifically associated with c-Myc, N-Myc, and L-Myc proteins, but not with a number of other bHLH, bZip, or bHLH-Zip proteins. The interaction between Max and c-Myc was dependent on the integrity of the c-Myc HLH-Zip domain, but not on the basic region or other sequences outside the domain. Furthermore, the Myc-Max complex bound to DNA in a sequence-specific manner under conditions where neither Max nor Myc exhibited appreciable binding. The DNA-binding activity of the complex was dependent on both the dimerization domain and the basic region of c-Myc. These results suggest that Myc family proteins undergo a restricted set of interactions in the cell and may belong to the more general class of eukaryotic DNA-binding transcription factors.\r"

A reconstitution is described that requires not only the growth factor, its receptor with tyrosine kinase activity, and the soluble phospholipase C-gamma 1, but also the small soluble actin-binding protein profilin. Profilin binds to the substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and inhibits its hydrolysis by unphosphorylated phospholipase C-gamma 1. Phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 by the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase overcomes the inhibitory effect of profilin and results in an effective activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1.\r"

These YACs spanned the fragile site in Xq27.3 as shown by fluorescent in situ hybridization. An internal 200-kilobase segment contained four chromosomal breakpoints generated by induction of fragile X expression. A single CpG island was identified in the cloned region between markers DXS463 and DXS465 that appears methylated in mentally retarded fragile X males, but not in nonexpressing male carriers of the mutation nor in normal males. This CpG island may indicate the presence of a gene involved in the clinical phenotype of the syndrome.\r"

This may be due to functional redundancy of En-2 and the related En-1 gene product during embryogenesis.

The choice between normal development and development into a specialized larval form called a dauer larva is regulated by competing environmental stimuli: food and a dauer pheromone. When the neuron classes ADF, ASG, ASI, and ASJ are killed, animals develop as dauer larvae regardless of environmental conditions. These neurons might sense food or dauer pheromone, or both, to initiate the specialized differentiation of many cell types that occurs during dauer formation. Entry into and exit from the dauer stage are primarily controlled by different chemosensory neurons. The analysis of mutants defective in dauer formation indicates that the chemosensory neurons are active in the absence of sensory inputs and that dauer pheromone inhibits the ability of these neurons to generate a signal necessary for normal development.\r"

Inferences about the functions of this area have now been made by examination of a broad range of visual capacities after ablation of V4 in rhesus monkeys. The results obtained suggest that this area is involved in more complex aspects of visual information processing than had previously been suggested. Monkeys had particularly severe deficits in situations where the task was to select target stimuli that had a lower contrast, smaller size, or slower rate of motion than the array of comparison stimuli from which they had to be discriminated. Extensive training on each specific task resulted in improved performance. However, after V4 ablation, the monkeys could not generalize the specific task to new stimulus configurations and to new spatial locations.\r"

The regulated expression of cadherins also controls cell polarity and tissue morphology. Cadherins are thus considered to be important regulators of morphogenesis. Moreover, pathological examinations suggest that the down-regulation of cadherin expression is associated with the invasiveness of tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "The three-dimensional atomic structure of a single-stranded DNA virus has been determined. Infectious virions of canine parvovirus contain 60 protein subunits that are predominantly VP-2. The central structural motif of VP-2 has the same topology (an eight-stranded antiparallel beta barrel) as has been found in many other icosahedral viruses but represents only about one-third of the capsid protein. There is a 22 angstrom (A) long protrusion on the threefold axes, a 15 A deep canyon circulating about each of the five cylindrical structures at the fivefold axes, and a 15 A deep depression at the twofold axes. By analogy with rhinoviruses, the canyon may be the site of receptor attachment. Residues related to the antigenic properties of the virus are found on the threefold protrusions. Some of the amino termini of VP-2 run to the exterior in full but not empty virions, which is consistent with the observation that some VP-2 polypeptides in full particles can be cleaved by trypsin. Eleven nucleotides are seen in each of 60 symmetry-related pockets on the interior surface of the capsid and together account for 13 percent of the genome.\r"

Although sequences in the downstream site (site I) were found to enhance transcription, purified LBP-1 specifically repressed transcription in vitro by binding to the upstream site (site II), which overlaps the TATA element. The binding of human TATA binding factor (TFIID) to the promoter before LBP-1 blocked repression, suggesting that repression resulted from an inhibition of TFIID binding to the TATA element. Furthermore, mutations that eliminated binding to site II both prevented repression in vitro and increased HIV-1 transcription in stably transformed cells. These findings suggest that a cellular factor regulates HIV-1 transcription in a manner that is characteristic of bacterial repressors and that this factor could be important in HIV-1 latency.\r"

Mitochondrial DNA types within heteroplasmic individuals differed greatly; in one comparison, the inferred sequence difference was 20 +/- 5 percent. Homoplasmic individuals with mitochondrial DNA similar to the heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA types were found. These observations are best explained by the hypothesis that biparental inheritance of mitochondrial DNA can occur in Mytilus.\r"

This probe was used to identify a rel-related complementary DNA that hybridized to a 2.6-kilobase messenger RNA present in human T and B lymphocytes. In vitro transcription and translation of the complementary DNA resulted in the synthesis of a protein with an apparent molecular size of 65 kilodaltons (kD). The translated protein showed weak DNA binding with a specificity for the kappa B binding motif. This protein-DNA complex comigrated with the complex obtained with the purified human p65 NF-kappa B subunit and binding was inhibited by I kappa B-alpha and -beta proteins. In addition, the 65-kD protein associated with the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B and the kappa B probe to form a complex with the same electrophoretic mobility as the NF-kappa B-DNA complex. Therefore the rel-related 65-kD protein may represent the p65 subunit of the active NF-kappa B transcription factor complex.\r"

The similarities between manual and vocal babbling suggest that babbling is a product of an amodal, brain-based language capacity under maturational control, in which phonetic and syllabic units are produced by the infant as a first step toward building a mature linguistic system. Contrary to prevailing accounts of the neurological basis of babbling in language ontogeny, the speech modality is not critical in babbling. Rather, babbling is tied to the abstract linguistic structure of language and to an expressive capacity capable of processing different types of signals (signed or spoken).\r"

  ".W": "During a five year period at Akron City Hospital, 165 Greenfield filters were placed in 165 patients. Of this group, 78 patients were available for long term analysis, and of these, 42 did not receive anticoagulation treatment for venous thromboembolic diseases, either acutely or on an outpatient basis. An analysis of the outcome for these 42 patients who had the Greenfield filter only as the primary mode of therapy for the disease included chart review and asking each person a standard set of questions. Leg swelling was the most common complaint, occurring in 33 per cent of patients. Venous stasis ulceration occurred in two patients and recurrent deep venous thrombosis occurred in one patient. When compared with a historical control group with venous thromboembolic disease that was treated with anticoagulation alone, the incidence of these sequelae in Greenfield-treated patients was not significantly different. Finally, in this review, the Greenfield filter is better than 95 per cent effective in the prevention of pulmonary embolism. This is no less effective than anticoagulation alone, the efficacy of which is 95 to 98 per cent. The placement of a Greenfield filter is a safe procedure that can usually be done after a local anesthetic was administered to the patient with a complication rate of less than 10 per cent. Unfortunately, major complications of anticoagulation (usually hemorrhage) are relatively common at a rate of 2 to 15 per cent, and occur more frequently in the older population. It is for reasons of safety of therapy and of an equal or better efficacy that the Greenfield filter is recommended in a broader range of clinical circumstances. In particular, it is concluded that the Greenfield filter should be used as a primary means of therapy in venous thromboembolic disease, particularly in those patients who are more than 65 years of age, when the risks of anticoagulation are most threatening.\r"

A retrospective review of the medical and autopsy records of all patients admitted between 1982 and 1988 was performed to describe the incidence of intestinal pathologic findings. Of all deaths, a total of 53 per cent of adults (greater than 18 years old) and 61 per cent of children (zero to 17 years old) were noted to have ischemic intestinal pathologic findings on autopsy, ranging from superficial necrosis to full thickness mucosal necrosis extending into the omentum. More than 80 per cent of these patients were septic at the time of death, with endogenous intestinal flora species most frequently identified as the causative agent. Less than 1 per cent (n = 16) of the patients admitted were clinically identified with intestinal pathologic examination, surgically explored and underwent resection of the intestine. Despite intervention, this group suffered a 69 per cent mortality rate. Although the documentation of bacterial translocation in a human model may be obscured by other potential sources of contamination, for example, burn wound, in combination with the immunosuppression inherent to the thermally injured, may lead to bacterial contamination of the systemic circulation and, therefore, may be a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality after thermal injury.\r"

The five year survival rate for regional metastases was 43.4 per cent compared with a five year survival rate for distant metastases of 4.9 per cent (p less than 0.0001). Favorable prognostic variables for survival from first regional metastases included primary melanoma sites on the extremities compared with the head, neck and trunk (p = 0.043) and a disease-free interval of more than one year from primary surgical treatment to regional metastases (p = 0.0058). Favorable prognostic variables for survival from the first distant metastasis included a disease-free interval of more than one year from primary surgical treatment to distant metastases (p = 0.0092), the type of resection of metastatic disease (p = 0.00027) and the addition of systemic immunotherapy (p = 0.0011). Forty-nine patients with totally resectable distant metastases had a five year survival rate from the treatment of the initial metastasis of 13.1 per cent, whereas 33 patients having palliative resections had a five year survival rate of 7.5 per cent. All 165 patients who did not have resection for distant metastases died within five years. The results of our experience support therapeutic efforts to ablate both regional and distant metastases of malignant melanoma when feasible.\r"

Preoperatively, the arm bleeding time in patients with renal disease was markedly prolonged (greater than 20 minutes) in 15 patients and slightly prolonged in one patient. There was no abnormal perioperative bleeding in 13 patients whose preoperative thigh bleeding time was seven minutes or less. Prolonged and excessive perioperative bleeding was observed in three patients whose thigh bleeding time was 8.0, 9.5 and 26.5 minutes.

  ".W": "Complications associated with indwelling central venous catheters in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation are presented. The study group was comprised of 123 patients who underwent transplantation from 1982 to 1988 in whom 139 catheters were placed. One hundred and fifteen of 139 catheters placed had a triple lumen, while 24 had a dual lumen. Percutaneous placement through the subclavian vein was used in 127 of 139 catheters with a low complication rate. Catheters remained in place for 65.0 +/- 55.5 days (mean +/- standard deviation). One hundred and eight catheters remained functional during the course of treatment for these patients and lasted until elective removal or until the patient died. Thirty-one catheters were removed because of a complication. Infection was the most common complication, occurring in 22 catheters. Seven infected catheters were salvaged with antibiotic therapy. Coagulase negative staphylococcus was the most frequent organism identified. Mechanical problems causing catheter malfunction, migration, thrombosis and cuff erosion occurred in 19 catheters; 15 were removed. We concluded that double and triple lumen Silastic (silicone rubber) catheters provide relatively safe and effective access for bone marrow transplant recipients. The triple lumen catheter provides an additional venous access port that facilitates intensive care. The duration of catheter function is sufficient in most patients for therapy during and after bone marrow transplantation. Infection is the most common complication; our results indicate that catheters can be maintained and salvaged in some patients with septicemia. Noninfectious complications are less frequent, although catheters with persistent mechanical problems are less likely to be salvaged.\r"

However, the incidence of choledocholithiasis in patients undergoing cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis was much higher in the Chinese immigrant population, 37.2 versus 11.8 per cent, a highly significant difference (p = 0.001). In addition, we often found the disease to be of greater severity in Chinese patients. They were more likely to have large numbers of stones in the duct and more likely to have significant ductal enlargement. This increased risk was essentially constant regardless of age. Because of this threefold risk of choledocholithiasis when operating on a Chinese immigrant from southeast Asia for cholelithiasis, intraoperative cholangiography is mandatory, even in those without other indications for common bile duct exploration.\r"

In 16 women, a palpable pelvic mass was seen on tomography, however, masses not appreciated clinically were visualized in another 29 women, and in five, a clinically palpable mass was not visualized by tomography. In 12 women who had a normal pelvic examination, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis was diagnosed by tomography. Over-all, there was poor correlation with roentgenographic findings and uterine incisional necrosis and dehiscence. We conclude that pelvic tomography is useful to evaluate some women with persistent puerperal infection, but that these studies must be correlated with clinical findings.\r"

During the period 1982 to 1989, all patients with a solid mammary mass, presenting to a specialized breast unit were initially investigated by fine needle aspiration cytologic examination (FNAC). To date, we present data on 2,000 consecutive aspirations with matching histologic diagnosis on the excised pathologic specimens. In particular, the relationship between tumor histologic factors and the accuracy of cytologic diagnosis was examined. The sensitivity of FNAC in the diagnosis of a malignant growth was 84 per cent; this represents first aspiration results only. The specificity was more than 99 per cent. The rate of acellular or unsatisfactory aspirations was 12 per cent. We had a positive predictive rate for diagnosis in carcinoma of the breast of almost 95 per cent. The diagnosis of lobular and in situ patterns of disease was questioned, with three of three in situ lesions and ten of 23 lobular lesions missed by FNAC. We do not recommend that FNAC replace excision biopsy and frozen section in the diagnosis of carcinoma of the breast.\r"

Twenty-eight patients died within 24 hours and 27 patients had serosal injuries. These patients were excluded from the study. The morbidity of gastric injury was defined in 243 patients. The probability of morbidity from the gastric wound was assessed by a multivariate analysis of 11 factors, including number of associated injuries, amount of contamination, age, mechanism of injury, shock, thoracostomy tube, injury to operation time, operative time, blood replacement and injury to the diaphragm or colon. Extensive complications developed in 65 patients. Eleven patients died. The gastric injury was directly associated with 15 extensive complications: ten instances of empyema after gastric and diaphragmatic injuries, two instances of gastric repair breakdown, gastric repair bleeding requiring exploration, a missed gastric injury and one instance of gastric outlet obstruction. One patient died of sepsis after breakdown of the gastric repair. Complications were statistically associated with age, gunshot wounds and the use of 2 or more units of blood. Other factors did not statistically increase complications. The 12.5 per cent empyema rate (ten of 81 patients) with gastric and diaphragmatic wounds was unexpected, but not statistically significant. Morbidity from penetrating gastric injuries is secondary to technical and infectious complications. Age, mechanism of injury and blood transfusion correlated with morbidity. The increased incidence of empyema suggests consideration of pleural lavage in combined gastric and diaphragmatic injuries.\r"

  ".W": "A review of 144 consecutive needle localization biopsies of the breast (NLBB) was performed to assess complications associated with this procedure. Thirty-four complications occurred in 27 patients. There were 11 wound infections associated with NLBB. During this time period, there were 1,583 clean general surgical operations performed, other than biopsy of the breast, yielding an over-all wound infection rate of 1.2 per cent (p less than 0.001). A trend was noted, suggesting that use of drains may have contributed to wound infection versus no drainage (25 versus 5 per cent, respectively). Electrocautery burns requiring local wound care occurred during seven biopsies and four of these patients subsequently had a wound infection develop. Four lesions required more than one excision to remove the abnormal mammary tissue, and in four, there was a failure to remove the lesion at the first operation. Fifty-three localization procedures were performed using methylene blue. In this group, only one patient required more than one biopsy to remove the abnormal mammary tissue, and there were no failures with this technique. Also, a smaller mean volume of tissue was removed in this group versus the standard NLBB (30.2 +/- 3.0 versus 53.3 +/- 4.6 cubic millimeters, respectively) (p less than 0.01). Four cardiovascular complications occurred, requiring overnight admission. All of these patients were more than 65 years old and had the procedure performed while under general anesthesia. Patient age, type of anesthesia, resident versus attending surgeon and length of procedure had no independent effect on local complication rate.\r"

This technique of in utero intravascular transfusion has several advantages. It uses a closed system that reduces the risk of infection and air embolus. The proximal extension tubing minimizes manipulation of the hub of the needle, which may lead to dislodgement of the needle, and permits a sampling port with minimal dead space between it and the fetal circulation. The HemoCue hemoglobinometer allows for rapid assessment of the concentration of fetal hemoglobin and, therefore, a shorter interval of time in which the needle is in the umbilical cord. This reduces the risks of trauma to the umbilical cord.\r"

The leading cause of death to all US travelers to Mexico was injuries (51%), with 18% of deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes. Of all travelers' deaths, 37% were due to circulatory diseases and less than 1% were due to infectious diseases. While the proportion of all deaths from motor vehicle crashes was similar for US citizens traveling in Mexico and US residents, travelers had significantly higher proportions of injury deaths due to aircraft crashes and drowning. Injury, rather than infectious diseases, appears to pose the greatest risk of death to travelers to Mexico. Physicians and travel clinics need to place greater emphasis on injury prevention when giving advice to clients traveling to Mexico.\r"

There was no change in the relative frequency rates of gastric adenocarcinoma among African Americans and Asians. Although these changes do not seem important enough to make the detection of gastric cancer a high-priority public health problem, they should alert physicians working in areas with high Hispanic populations of the relative possibility of the occurrence of gastric malignancy even in young patients. Also, we have found that gastric cancer is still prevalent in whites of low socioeconomic class.\r"

Whereas positron emission tomography has improved the dynamic understanding of tumors, the labeled selective tumor receptors with positron emitters will enhance the ability to specifically diagnose and greatly aid in the pretreatment planning for tumors. Modulation of these receptors will also affect tumor growth and metabolism. Novel methods to deliver antitumor agents to the brain and new approaches using biologic response modifiers also hold promise to further improve the management of brain tumors.\r"

Each volunteer then walked downhill on a -14-degree incline on a treadmill at 3 km per hour for an hour. After a 2-week rest, the subjects were crossed over. Serial serum creatine kinase activity was measured immediately before and 8, 24, 48, 72, 120, and 144 hours after each treadmill session. With each subject serving as his own control, peak mean serum creatine kinase activity (/+- SEM) following treadmill after lovastatin therapy was similar to that following placebo (168.4 +/- 25.8 U per liter versus 146.7 +/- 14.7 U per liter, respectively [P = .9]). With an alpha value of .05, we had greater than a 99% chance of detecting a difference in the rise of serum creatine kinase activity of 200 U per liter between groups.

Eighteen men with symptomatic coronary artery disease, exercise-induced ischemia and minimal symptoms, underwent 4 blinded treatment periods of 2 weeks' duration (2 placebo, 1 atenolol, 1 nifedipine). Those that did not have ischemia eliminated by monotherapy received combination therapy with both drugs. Forty-eight-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was used to quantitate ischemic parameters at the end of each period. Both nifedipine and atenolol as monotherapy reduced the number of ischemic episodes and the average duration of each episode compared with placebo (p less than 0.05). Compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced the total duration of ischemia (p less than 0.05) but the effect of atenolol on ischemia duration was of borderline significance (p = 0.066). There were no differences in reduction of ischemic parameters when atenolol was compared with nifedipine (difference not significant). In the 9 patients who continued to have ischemia with monotherapy, combination therapy eliminated it in 2 and reduced the duration by greater than 50% in the remaining patients compared with placebo. In conclusion, monotherapy with nifedipine or atenolol is similarly effective in eliminating or reducing ambulant ischemia. Combination therapy can provide additional benefit in those with continued ischemia.\r"

Ischemia was seen as ST elevation in 2 patients or ST depression in 11; it was anterior in 5 patients, inferior in 4 and undefined in 4. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms with noise levels less than or equal to 1 microV were obtained from Holter tapes during 54 of 61 ischemic attacks recorded in the study group (88%), and compared with 54 tracings recorded within 60 minutes of the index attacks. Baseline tracings were normal in 8 patients (62%), showed a long QRS duration in 2 (15%), and both a long QRS duration and a late potential in the remaining 3 (23%). Comparison of recordings at baseline and during ischemic attacks revealed no significant changes in signal-averaged electrocardiographic parameters. Absence of significant differences was also noted when analysis was performed according to the type of ischemic attacks (associated with ST elevation [n = 14] or ST depression [n = 40]), their location (anterior [n = 21] or inferior [n = 23]), their duration (greater than 10 minutes [n = 29] or less than or equal to 10 minutes [n = 25]), and their magnitude (greater than 2 mm [n = 18] or less than or equal to 2 mm [n = 36]). It is concluded that spontaneous transient myocardial ischemia, independent of its type, location, duration and magnitude, does not generate a substrate for late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram.\r"

Thirteen patients had exercise angiograms of sufficient quality to undergo analysis and were classified into 2 groups. Group 1 had no or only mild coronary artery disease; group 2 had significant coronary artery disease as manifested by new, exercise-induced, left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities. RV systolic pressure increased in both groups during exercise: 33 to 57 mm Hg in group 1 (p = 0.0002) and 33 to 55 mm Hg in group 2 (p = 0.0004). Pulmonary resistance did not change in group 1 during exercise but increased in group 2 (3.2 to 4.8 Wood units, p = 0.04). RV ejection fraction increased slightly, but not significantly, during exercise in group 1, but decreased in group 2 (73 vs 58% with exercise [p = 0.01]). The change in RV ejection fraction from rest to exercise correlated closely with the change in pulmonary resistance from rest to exercise (r = -0.89, p less than 0.0001). RV regional wall motion analysis demonstrated a generalized decline in regional ejection fraction in group 2 during exercise, even in patients without right coronary artery disease. In conclusion, there is a decline in RV ejection fraction during exercise in patients with significant coronary artery disease. The generalized reduction in regional RV ejection fraction coupled with the close correlation with the change in pulmonary resistance suggests that increased afterload, rather than RV ischemia, is the cause.\r"

In the present study, 313 patients with coronary artery disease were studied to evaluate coronary collateral circulation in relation to the presence of systemic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients had greater than or equal to 95% diameter luminal obstruction of either the left anterior descending or the right coronary artery. Patients were classified into 2 groups: The hypertensive group consisted of 61 patients, mean age 55 +/- 9 years, with systemic hypertension, and the normotensive group consisted of 252 patients, mean age 53 +/- 8 years, without hypertension. The hypertensive group had more severe angina pectoris and less history of healed myocardial infarction than the normotensive group (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular wall thickness was 1.26 +/- 0.1 cm in the hypertensive and 1.03 +/- 0.06 cm in the normotensive group (p less than 0.001). The hypertensive group had more extensive coronary collateral circulation than the normotensive group (p less than 0.01). There was a positive relation between coronary collateral circulation and left ventricular wall thickness (p less than 0.001). These results indicate that patients with systemic hypertension and coronary artery disease have an increase in coronary collateral circulation corresponding to the degree of left ventricular wall thickness.\r"

Intracoronary stenting was developed to avoid these complications by pressing the intimal and medial flaps against the vessel wall, thus reducing the risk of acute thrombosis. A total of 22 stents were implanted into the coronary arteries of 15 patients with dissections after balloon angioplasty causing angina pectoris or ischemic electrocardiographic changes. Stent delivery was successful in all cases. In 1 patient acute stent thrombosis was documented and treated successfully by thrombolytic therapy. Another patient underwent coronary artery bypass surgery 24 hours later because of persisting angina. Angiograms after 24 hours documented vessel patency in the remaining 14 patients. Late control angiograms after 4 to 6 months were obtained in 12 of 14 patients. Vessel patency without significant restenosis was observed in 8 patients, restenosis in 3 and reocclusion in 1 patient. All 3 patients with multiple stent implantation had restenosis (n = 2) or reocclusion (n = 1), compared with 1 patient with single stent implantation. Thus, intracoronary stenting appears to be a secure and effective method of handling bailout situations caused by dissection after balloon angioplasty, with good long-term results when only a single stent is implanted.\r"

Thirteen (30%) of these patients had hypokinesia on left ventriculography, and 20 patients (47%) had a persistently abnormal electrocardiogram. Seven patients (16%) had recurrent out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during an average follow-up of 86 +/- 54 months. The presence of either wall motion or electrocardiographic abnormalities defined patients with a several-fold higher risk of recurrent cardiac arrest than those without such abnormalities. The risk for recurrent cardiac arrest within 5 years was 30% in those with abnormal electrocardiograms versus 5% in the others (p less than 0.03). Age was an independent predictor of recurrent cardiac arrest in this group (p less than 0.01); surprisingly, recurrent cardiac arrest was occurring more often among younger patients. Although cardiac arrest is unusual in patients without major structural heart disease, its recurrence in such survivors is common. Patients at relatively high risk for recurrent ventricular fibrillation can be identified by their youth and by abnormalities detected on the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram or by contrast left ventriculography.\r"

  ".W": "Although patients may develop arrhythmias due to preexcitation syndromes at any time from the prenatal period to late adulthood, presentation in late adulthood is considered uncommon and has not been well studied. From June 1981 to June 1989, 73 patients were documented to have preexcitation syndromes on the basis of electrophysiologic studies. Those whose initial arrhythmias appeared at an age greater than 50 years (group 1, n = 13) were compared with the remaining 60 patients (group 2). All group 1 patients presented in the setting of acute medical or surgical diseases (n = 7), or chronic cardiac disease (n = 6) commonly associated with middle age and often with atrial arrhythmias; only 13 group 2 patients had underlying illnesses (p = 0.0001). Almost two-thirds of group 2 patients were evaluated because of narrow complex orthodromic tachycardia or palpitations and electrocardiographic evidence of preexcitation. Wide complex tachycardia was more often a reason for referral of older patients (7 of 13 vs 11 of 60, p less than 0.05), among whom atrial fibrillation/flutter also tended to be more frequent (4 of 13 vs 11 of 60, difference not significant). The PR and QRS intervals of group 1 patients were within the normal range and differed significantly from those of group 2 patients (PR, 0.15 +/- 0.04 vs 0.11 +/- 0.03 second, p less than 0.001; QRS, 0.09 +/- 0.01 vs 0.12 +/- 0.03 second, p less than 0.001), making electrocardiographic identification of preexcitation more difficult in group 1. Several factors likely contributed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It is widely believed but has never been proved that idiopathic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias beginning during or after weekends or winter holidays are frequently alcohol-related (\"holiday heart\" syndrome). The time of arrhythmia onset was therefore studied in relation to self-reported ethanol consumption and results of a screening test for alcoholism (CAGE questionnaire) in 289 patients aged less than 65 years admitted for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. There were 102 patients having an etiologically idiopathic arrhythmia with a known time of onset. Among them, but not among those with disease-related arrhythmias, patients with arrhythmic episodes beginning on Saturdays or on Sundays were more often chronic alcohol abusers (9 of 19, 47%) than either patients with episodes beginning from Mondays through Fridays (18 of 83, 22%; p = 0.040) or control subjects from the out-of-hospital population (8 of 66, 12%; p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, the time of arrhythmia onset was related to the CAGE response (G2 = 6.0, p = 0.014) but not to the most recent ethanol use. However, the increased frequency of problem drinkers among patients with weekend-onset idiopathic arrhythmias was only relative, and resulted from a decreased number of abstainers and non-problem drinkers. No conspicuous clustering of alcohol-related arrhythmias was seen after New Year's or May Day. Thus, although the present study confirms an association between heavy drinking and idiopathic arrhythmias beginning during weekends, it shows that the question may be of a relative rather than an absolute overrepresentation. The term holiday heart may also be somewhat misleading since no postholiday accumulation of alcohol-related arrhythmias was found.\r"

  ".W": "To perform a meta-analysis of published reports in an attempt to determine the mean and range of normal ambulatory blood pressure (BP), 23 studies including a total of 3,476 normal subjects were reviewed. Most studies were compatible with a mean 24-hour BP in the range of 115 to 120/70 to 75 mm Hg, a mean daytime BP of 120 to 125/75 to 80 mm Hg, and a mean nighttime BP of 105 to 110/60 to 65 mm Hg. With weighting for the number of subjects included in the individual studies, the 24-hour BP averaged 118/72 mm Hg, the daytime BP 123/76 mm Hg, and the nighttime BP 106/64 mm Hg. The night/day pressure ratio averaged 0.87 for systolic and 0.83 for diastolic BP, with ranges across the individual studies from 0.79 to 0.92 and from 0.75 to 0.90, respectively. If the mean +/- 2 standard deviation interval in the various studies was considered normal, the range of normality was on average 97 to 139/57 to 87 mm Hg for the 24-hour BP, 101 to 146/61 to 91 mm Hg for the daytime BP, and 86 to 127/48 to 79 mm Hg for the nighttime BP. Until the results of prospective studies on the relation between the ambulatory BP and the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality become available, the aforementioned intervals, which summarize the experience of 23 investigators, could serve as a temporary reference for clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "Quinidine causes vasodilation directly and by inhibition of adrenergic vasoconstriction, but it also exerts negative inotropic activity. Although this drug is often administered to patients with severe congestive heart failure, the net consequences of these opposing actions have not been evaluated in such patients. The hemodynamic and neurohormonal response to oral quinidine (600 mg) in 19 patients with severe chronic heart failure was therefore determined. Vasodilation was the predominant effect of quinidine, with reductions in mean arterial, left ventricular filling and right atrial pressures of -9% (confidence interval [CI] -5 to -13), -8% (CI -19 to 3), -15% (CI -26 to -4), respectively. The quinidine-induced vasodilation increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations by 44% (CI +17 to +72) and 47% (CI +2 to +91), respectively. No change in cardiac performance was noted, with the cardiac index slightly increased (+10%, CI +2 to +17) and stroke work index unchanged (0%, CI -11 to +11) after quinidine. Although the mean serum quinidine concentration was within the therapeutic range or lower in all patients, the serum quinidine concentration and the change in mean arterial pressure did correlate (r2 = 0.64). In conclusion, vasodilation is the predominant hemodynamic effect of oral quinidine in patients with congestive heart failure. However, potential adverse effects may be caused by consequent neurohormonal activation.\r"

  ".U": "91174006\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that short-term infusion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has beneficial effects in congestive heart failure. The effects of prolonged infusion of CGRP on hemodynamic functions, plasma hormones and renal blood flow were studied in 9 patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV, ejection fraction less than 35%). Hemodynamic variables were measured at 30-minute intervals for 8 hours during CGRP infusion (8 ng/kg/min) and for 2 hours after discontinuation. CGRP caused a decrease in right atrial (28%, p less than 0.05), pulmonary artery (22%, p less than 0.02), pulmonary artery wedge (37%, p less than 0.001) and systemic arterial (18%, p less than 0.05) pressures. Systemic vascular resistance decreased more than pulmonary vascular resistance. Cardiac output (72%, p less than 0.001) and stroke volume (60%, p less than 0.02) increased. Heart rate did not change. There was no evidence of tolerance throughout the infusion. The hemodynamic effects were lost within 30 minutes of stopping CGRP. Renal blood flow (34%, p less than 0.01) and glomerular filtration rate (43%, p less than 0.01) increased. Atrial natriuretic peptide decreased (p less than 0.05), while plasma cortisol (p less than 0.02) increased. Plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, renin activity, aldosterone and growth hormone were unchanged. It is concluded that in patients with severe congestive heart failure, CGRP has sustained beneficial effects on hemodynamic functions and has no adverse effects on hormones. Unlike many other vasodilators, CGRP also increases renal blood flow and glomerular filtration.\r"

Specific attention was paid to the nature of the pulmonary blood supply and to its influence on patient outcome. Confluent pulmonary arteries supplied by a single ductus arteriosus were present in 72 patients (69%, group I), whereas 32 patients (31%, group II) had a pulmonary blood supply that was partially or exclusively dependent on systemic collateral arteries. An estimate of the probability of survival for 10 years was 69% in the entire cohort, with no different between patients in group I and group II. Definitive surgical repair was performed in 33 of 72 group I patients (46%), compared with 5 of 32 group II patients (16%). Arborization and distribution abnormalities of the pulmonary arteries as well as intrapulmonary stenoses that were exclusively present in patients with systemic collateral arteries (p less than 0.00001) accounted for the significantly lower probability of undergoing corrective surgery in group II patients.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac catheterization and angiography were performed in 22 patients with pulmonic valve atresia and ventricular septal defect to evaluate pulmonary morphology and hemodynamics before and after repair. In 12 of the 22, pulmonic valve atresia and ventricular septal defect were associated with major aortopulmonary collateral arteries, which were ligated in most. Mean postoperative pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) ranged from 9 to 92 mm Hg (mean 28 +/- 19) and pulmonary vascular resistance ranged from 1.1 to 35.2 U.m2 (mean 6.4 +/- 8.0). These data correlated (r = 0.89, p less than 0.001). The number of pulmonary artery subsegments connected to the central pulmonary arteries was 22 to 42 (mean 38 +/- 6). Univariate analysis revealed that the mean postoperative PAP correlated with the number of pulmonary artery subsegments connected to the central pulmonary arteries (r = -0.81, p less than 0.001), with mean postoperative PAP (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001), with the postoperative pulmonary artery area index of the right and left pulmonary arteries at prebranching (r = -0.76, p less than 0.001), and with the sum of the pulmonary artery areas after branching (r = -0.69, p less than 0.005). Pulmonary vascular resistance correlated with the number of pulmonary artery subsegments connected to the central pulmonary arteries (r = -0.85, p less than 0.001), with the mean preoperative PAP (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001), with the sum of the pulmonary artery areas after branching (r = -0.73, p less than 0.001), and with the postoperative pulmonary artery area index (r = -0.70, p less than 0.001). The incidence of pulmonary vascular resistance being less than 3 U.m2 was significantly higher in patients with greater than 36 pulmonary artery subsegments connected to the central pulmonary arteries and with a preoperative pulmonary artery area index greater than 0.5 (88%) (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is now the treatment of choice for pulmonary hypertension due to chronic pulmonary thromboemboli. A precise assessment of location and extension of these thrombi is important because only proximal chronic pulmonary thromboemboli are accessible to surgery. Because intravascular ultrasound imaging can assess not only arterial luminal size, but also wall thickness, its value as a complement to angiography was assessed in 11 patients aged 35 to 64 years with severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure, mean +/- standard deviation 70 +/- 19 mm Hg; pulmonary artery resistance, 609 +/- 297 dynes.s.cm-5). Intravascular ultrasound was obtained in 10 of 11 patients and no complication occurred. Intravascular ultrasound identified 10 segments with suspected chronic pulmonary thromboemboli in 7 patients, all confirmed at operation. Nine segments were considered normal, all of which (except 1) were free of chronic pulmonary thromboemboli at operation. Image quality was highly dependent on pulmonary artery size and position of the catheter. Therefore, intravascular ultrasound of pulmonary arteries is feasible and safe in patients with pulmonary hypertension. It may help to assess the location and extension of the pathologic process involving pulmonary arteries.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of right ventricular (RV) oxidative metabolism is limited by the inability to easily determine oxygen extraction by the RV myocardium and the complex morphology of this ventricle. Because left ventricular C-11 clearance rate constants closely correlate with myocardial oxygen consumption, it was postulated that C-11 clearance rate constants for the RV free wall should also reflect its oxygen consumption. Therefore, RV C-11 clearance rate constants were compared with RV loading in 21 patients with aortic valve disease to assess the possible use of this technique for noninvasive evaluation of RV oxidative metabolism. RV free wall C-11 clearance rate constants correlated with the product of systolic pulmonary artery pressure and heart rate for all patients (r = 0.65, p = 0.002), but the relation was stronger if 2 patients with overt RV dysfunction were excluded (r = 0.83, p = 0.001). On the basis of mean pulmonary artery pressures, patients were stratified into subgroups with normal (group I, n = 8) and elevated (group II, n = 13) pulmonary pressures and were compared with 10 normal control subjects. RV C-11 clearance rate constants were significantly higher in group II than in group I and in normal control subjects (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that RV C-11 acetate clearance rate constants can provide noninvasive evaluation of RV oxidative metabolism. This technique may allow serial assessment of RV performance in various cardiac and pulmonary diseases, and particularly of changes associated with therapeutic interventions.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of coronary flow velocity in clinical cases contributes to understanding the pathophysiology of coronary circulation. To determine absolute coronary flow velocity, coronary blood flow was assessed with an end-mounted Doppler catheter (3Fr, 20 MHz), which was combined with a custom-designed fast-Fourier transformation analysis system. In vitro study using model circuit, actual flow velocity (8 to 96 cm/s) was well correlated with that determined by this catheter system (y = 1.01 X +1.5, r = 0.988). In a clinical study of 12 patients with normal coronary arteriograms, the Doppler catheter was positioned at the proximal left anterior descending artery. Clear flow velocity patterns, which consisted of predominant diastolic components and preceding small systolic components, were obtained in all cases. The peak flow velocity was 17 +/- 8 cm/s (mean +/- standard deviation) during systole and 44 +/- 12 cm/s during diastole in this portion. In 5 patients, the great cardiac vein flow, which reflects the left anterior descending artery flow, was simultaneously measured during rapid atrial pacing. During pacing, percent increases in flow velocity were well correlated with those in great cardiac vein flow (y = 0.90 x +6.4, r = 0.935). These results indicate that catheter-tip Doppler technique with fast-Fourier transformation analysis may be useful in quantitatively determining coronary flow velocity in clinical cases.\r"

The doses were doubled if diastolic pressure was above 95 mm Hg after one month of treatment. Blood pressure, heart rate, and physical fitness (endurance during a standard cycle ergometer exercise) were measured and side effects assessed after each two-month treatment period. Mean blood pressures were significantly lower after treatment with metoprolol (154/92 mm Hg), captopril (157/92 mm Hg), and hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride (152/91 mm Hg) than after placebo (170/101 mm Hg). Heart rate was significantly lower after treatment with metoprolol (64 beats/minute) than after placebo (77 beats/minute). Exercise endurance was lower after treatment with metoprolol (498 seconds) and hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride (519 seconds) than after placebo (529 seconds) and higher after captopril (541 seconds). More patients reached the target exercise work load after captopril than after the other treatments. No patients withdrew from treatment because of side effects or abnormal laboratory test results. All three active treatments benefited the elderly hypertensive patients and did not lower their physical fitness. Captopril appeared to be more effective than the other two treatments.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia in the elderly after the dementia of Alzheimer's disease. Six forms of vascular dementia have been described: multi-infarct dementia, lacunar dementia, Binswanger's subcortical encephalopathy, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, white-matter lesions associated with dementias, and single-infarct dementia. Each is described. Severe dementia is found in 5% of persons over age 65 and in 15% to 20% of persons over age 80 years. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 50% to 60% of cases of severe dementia and vascular dementia for 10% to 20%; 20% of the patients have both disorders. The incidence of vascular dementia, which seems to be declining, is about 7/1,000 persons/year. Hypertension is the most powerful risk factor for all vascular dementias. Vascular dementias can be accurately diagnosed by using clinical and mental state examinations, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, ischemic scores, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The most successful treatment of vascular dementia is the prevention of cerebral infarcts. Study of the incidence of vascular dementias and their treatment will be included in the European Trial on Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SYST-EUR) of 3,000 elderly hypertensive patients.\r"

Patients in each treatment group were divided into those aged 55 to 69 years and those aged under 55. Whereas no age-related differences were apparent with propranolol, nadolol alone, or captopril alone, in all three studies the blood pressure-reducing effect was found to be greater in the older group of thiazide-treated patients than in the younger thiazide-treated group. The antihypertensive drugs studied are at least as effective in older as in younger hypertensive patients and the antihypertensive response with diuretics is greater in older patients than in younger patients.\r"

Thiazide diuretics are inexpensive and effective, but they are associated with metabolic side effects that are becoming less acceptable as newer agents become available. Beta blockers are effective, but can be associated with central nervous system side effects and are often contraindicated by coexisting disease. Recently, attention has been focused on the newer agents, including calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The advantage of calcium antagonists is that they do not produce metabolic side effects. However, they are expensive and may cause vasodilatory side effects. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are effective and relatively free of side effects and may be particularly useful for elderly hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure.\r"

During the trial, total mortality and cardiovascular and noncardiovascular terminating events were highest in the patients at the leanest BMI quintile. The association between BMI and cardiovascular end points was U-shaped, whereas noncardiovascular mortality decreased with increasing BMI. The results in the women were similar to those in the total group. The U-shaped relation was confirmed with Cox's proportional hazards model, controlling for age, gender, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, serum cholesterol, blood glucose, and cardiovascular complications at entry. The BMI level with the lowest risk was 28 to 29 kg/m2 for total mortality and cardiovascular terminating events, 26 to 27 kg/m2 for cardiovascular mortality, and 31 to 32 kg/m2 for noncardiovascular mortality. BMI did not modify the favorable effects of drug treatment. There was no evidence that obesity would protect elderly hypertensive men or women from cardiovascular complications.\r"

ISH is more prevalent in elderly women than in elderly men. Estimates of the prevalence of ISH vary according to its definition and the number of blood pressure measurements. There is evidence that the prevalence of ISH is decreasing. Results of a survey of the prevalence of ISH in 11 countries are presented; the estimates among men aged 60 to 69 years ranged from 1% in Israel to 24% in Norway. Only a prospective standardized survey conducted in several countries will reveal the true prevalence of ISH.\r"

Until World War I, psychiatrists were not interested in systematic classification, although they were concerned with diagnosis. The first official nosology, adopted in 1918, reflected the need to collect mental hospital data. The federal Bureau of the Census had a role in the development of this nosology in that it required such data. The publication of DSM-I marked an internal transformation that mirrored the growing dominance of psychodynamic and psychoanalytic psychiatry and the relative weakness of the biological tradition. This transformation occurred largely as a result of the lessons learned by psychiatrists during World War II. The author's basic argument is that nosology reflected not only psychiatric ideology but also other, external determinants at any given point in time.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The authors review the usefulness, reliability, and validity of recently proposed subtypes of primary insomnia. DSM-III uses \"primary insomnia\" to indicate chronic insomnia not associated with other diagnosable mental or medical disorders, whereas the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) recognizes three subtypes: psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, and sleep state misperception. METHOD: After reviewing all of the primary source references for each insomnia disorder in the ICSD and all of the additional primary sources cited in each of these, the authors conducted an automated literature search using Medline. Of the 48 primary sources located, the authors selected 27 studies that were reported in peer-reviewed journals, had the largest available subject groups, used diagnostic reliability procedures, and included control groups. RESULTS: The studies reviewed contained limited empirical support for the proposed distinction between idiopathic and psychophysiological insomnia. Sleep state misperception appears, however, to be a highly prevalent feature of chronic insomnia generally, rather than only a specific disorder per se. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that there is not yet sufficient empirical evidence to warrant the abandonment of DSM-III-R \"primary insomnia\" and the adoption of the ICSD subtypes in DSM-IV. However, they affirm the heuristic value of the ICSD subtypes and the need for field trials to compare the performance characteristics of the DSM-III-R and ICSD systems with respect to 1) interrater reliability, 2) effects of rater expertise (generalist versus specialist) on rates of agreement, and 3) effects of polysomnographic data on rates of agreement.\r"

Because operations in the brain require the participation of various brain areas, a model that does not require a one-to-one relationship between the physical and mental, but rather allows an association between clusters of physical processes and one or more mental phenomena, may reflect better the relation between physical brain phenomena and mental activities.\r"

The review also highlights the development of community programs based on treatment models for the chronically mentally ill. In addition, monitored community treatment programs appear cost-effective when compared with hospital-based programs. These factors point to the development in the 1990s of program standards for the release of insanity defense acquittees.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Reporting of child sexual abuse is mandatory in all 50 states. Conceptual distinctions between privileged communications and mandatory reporting are reviewed, and the impact of recent changes in Maryland's reporting laws is examined. METHOD: Beginning in 1964 Maryland law required reporting if abuse was suspected when a physician examined a child. In 1988 reporting of disclosures by adult patients about child sexual abuse that occurred while they were in treatment was mandated. In 1989 all patient disclosures, even about such abuse that occurred before treatment, became reportable. During the period of statutory changes, the Johns Hopkins Sexual Disorders Clinic had kept track of adult patients who referred themselves for treatment and adult patients' disclosures of child sexual abuse. This allowed analysis of the impact produced by changes in the reporting requirements. RESULTS: 1) Mandatory reporting of disclosures about prior child sexual abuse deterred undetected adult abusers from entering treatment. The rate of self-referrals when such reporting became mandatory in 1989 dropped from approximately seven per year (73 over a 10-year period) to zero. This may have caused some unidentified children to remain at risk. 2) Mandatory reporting deterred patients' disclosures about child sexual abuse that occurred during treatment. In 1988 the disclosure rate during treatment dropped from approximately 21 per year to zero. This deprived clinicians of information important for early intervention. 3) Mandatory reporting failed to increase the number of abused children identified. The number identified secondary to such disclosures was zero. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal protection of children, as well as treatment for adult patients, may be better accomplished by legislation that supports options other than reporting.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine empirically how many patients are identified as delirious or nondelirious according to DMS-III, DMS-III-R, and ICD-10 criteria. METHOD: Daily, a trained research assistant using a structured instrument to detect the presence of symptoms of delirium evaluated 325 elderly patients who were admitted to a general hospital for acute medical problems. Each patient's symptoms were then compared with these diagnostic criteria sets to determine if the patient met criteria for delirium. RESULTS: DSM-III criteria were the most inclusive: they identified 125 patients as delirious. DSM-III-R identified a somewhat different group of 106 patients as delirious. ICD-10 criteria identified only 30 patients as delirious. CONCLUSIONS: The development of new criteria for delirium (e.g., DSM-IV) will have to balance the need to define a pure group of patients for research purposes with the need to include cases of clinical interest. Changes in criteria should be based on data such as those presented in this paper.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To improve the ability to diagnose dissociative disorders in The Netherlands, the authors conducted a study using a Dutch version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D) with additional questions on childhood trauma and symptoms of borderline and histrionic personality disorders. METHOD: All interviews were audiotaped or videotaped and rated by two investigators separately. Forty-four patients (42 women and two men) participated in the study. Most of the patients had been referred for evaluation of dissociative symptoms; five had participated in a nationwide survey on incest. None of the patients had ever received a diagnosis of a dissociative disorder, and none had evidence of organic brain syndrome or mental retardation. All patients were in active treatment; 23 were being treated in an outpatient psychiatric service, 13 in an inpatient psychiatric service, and eight in private practice. Thirty-two patients had been psychiatric inpatients at least once. RESULTS: Four diagnostic groups of patients were identified: two with dissociative disorders (12 patients with multiple personality disorder and 11 with dissociative disorder not otherwise specified), one with DSM-III-R personality disorders (11 patients), and one without dissociative or personality disorders (10 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Dissociative disorders are clearly not only an American phenomenon. The diagnosis can be made outside of the United States if the symptoms are sought. The SCID-D proved to be a promising instrument.\r"

METHOD: The authors conducted a mail survey of the attitudes of practicing psychiatrists (N = 454), residency program directors (N = 128), residents (N = 1,331), and researchers (N = 196) toward the scheduled publication of DSM-IV in the early 1990s. RESULTS: They found that the majority of all four groups believed that DSM-IV is being published prematurely. In contrast to respondents who believed that the timing of DSM-IV is appropriate, those who indicated that it is being published too soon had more recently completed their residency training and also believed that DSM-III-R was published prematurely. There was no association between the psychiatrists' responses and their theoretical orientation, Board certification status, ownership of the DSM manuals, the length of time they had used DSM-III, and the diagnostic manual (DSM-III or DSM-III-R) they were currently using. CONCLUSIONS: The belief that DSM-IV is being published too soon could contribute to underuse of DSM-IV by substantial numbers of psychiatrists. Thus, to foster compliance with it, APA must preserve in its efforts to demonstrate that the advantages of publishing it in 1993 outweigh the disadvantages of adopting yet another manual.\r"

The authors conducted this study to provide such information. METHOD: They examined the neuropsychological performance of 96 patients 6-18 years old who met DSM-III-R criteria for Tourette's disorder; 51 of these patients were taking neuroleptic medications and 45 were not. The groups were well matched with regard to age, sex, education, and duration of symptoms. Each group was given a complete neuropsychological test battery as well as instruments rating symptoms of Tourette's disorder, obsessive-compulsive characteristics, and other behavioral disturbances. RESULTS: The patients taking medications did not differ from those not taking medications on any of the neuropsychological, intellectual, or educational measures. In addition, the groups did not differ with regard to level of Tourette's disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation suggest that patients with Tourette's disorder who do not experience intolerable side effects from neuroleptic medications are able to perform on educational, intellectual, and neuropsychological tests at a level comparable to that of unmedicated patients. These results have positive implications for patients with Tourette's disorder who respond to neuroleptic medications.\r"

The goal of this study was to examine relations among the following: the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and the deficit-nondeficit classification. METHOD: Forty-seven patients with schizophrenia were recruited according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The standardized assessment procedures were administered by a trained psychiatric research team. RESULTS: Examination of the BPRS showed that the patients had highest scores on the thought disorder factor and the symptoms specific to schizophrenia. Classification of patients as having the positive, negative, or mixed type of schizophrenia resulted in a finding of seven with the positive, seven with the negative, and 33 with the mixed type. The division of patients into those with the deficit syndrome (N = 29) and those without (N = 18) was related to symptom specificity and to positive and negative symptoms. Deficit syndrome patients had more symptoms specific to schizophrenia, fewer nonspecific symptoms, and, as expected, greater severity of negative symptoms. Cluster analysis revealed three clusters of patients: those with low negative symptom scores and high scores on specific symptoms (the majority were without the deficit syndrome); those with high scores on negative, positive, and specific symptoms (the majority had the deficit syndrome); and those with lower scores on specific symptoms and high scores on negative and positive symptoms (the majority had the deficit syndrome). CONCLUSIONS: The scales showed some overlap but also seemed to measure complementary aspects of the phenomenology of schizophrenia. Subtypes of patients identified by the combined use of these scales may differ in underlying pathology.\r"

METHOD: Forty-one outpatients satisfying the DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia were examined for minor physical anomalies by using the Waldrop scale. These subjects were drawn from a group of 45 such patients whose cognitive function had been previously evaluated with Trail Making Tests A and B and whose biological mothers had been interviewed for any history of obstetric complications or family history of schizophrenia. RESULTS: Linear multiple regression analysis showed that higher scores for minor physical anomalies were associated with impaired cognitive flexibility on Trail Making Test B, family history of schizophrenia in a first-degree relative, maternal history of obstetric complications, smaller number of siblings, later position in the birth order, and male sex. A family history of schizophrenia was particularly associated with abnormalities of the mouth. The association between minor physical anomalies in the patients and obstetric complications in their mothers appeared to be confined to instances in which the mother had a history of bleeding in early pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Minor physical anomalies indicate early dysmorphogenesis in schizophrenia, particularly in males, which appears to be associated more reliably with genetic rather than obstetric factors and with cognitive impairment.\r"

METHOD: Twenty recently admitted patients with mood-incongruent psychoses underwent 1) interviews with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for diagnostic evaluation and symptom profiles, 2) drug-free baseline measurements of CSF neurotensin and homovanillic acid, and 3) close monitoring of a therapeutic trial of haloperidol to determine latency of antipsychotic response. RESULTS: A relative deficiency in CSF neurotensin was found in a subgroup of psychotic women whose clinical response to haloperidol was delayed for 11 to 35 days after initiation of the neuroleptic. These patients had greater thought disorder, delusions-hallucinations, behavioral disorganization, and impaired functioning than did psychotic patients with higher CSF concentrations of neurotensin. Neurotensin concentrations increased during treatment with haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides further evidence that there is diminished availability of neurotensin in some psychotic patients, with increases in neurotensin early in neuroleptic treatment. Exploration of neurotensin receptor agonists as a potentially novel class of antipsychotic compounds is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine the course of involuntarily administered medication in a state hospital population. METHOD: The authors retrospectively examined the records of all 51 involuntarily medicated patients in six state hospitals in New York City in a single calendar year. Clinical course was recorded for the period of involuntary medication and for 12 months thereafter. These patients were compared to 51 patients on the same wards who accepted medication. RESULTS: Clinicians assessed involuntarily medicated patients as more dangerous to themselves or others and less delusional after treatment than the comparison patients. Long-acting intramuscular antipsychotics were prescribed more frequently for involuntarily medicated patients. No differences were observed in rates of discharge, outpatient cooperation, or rehospitalization. Half of the patients in both groups remained continuously institutionalized, and of those who left the hospital, only 30% of the involuntarily medicated group and 40% of the comparison group took medication as outpatients. CONCLUSIONS: For these chronically severely ill patients, involuntary medication did not appear to enhance insight or cooperation or result in rapid return to the community. Involuntary medication is often a necessary short-term, in-hospital management strategy, but it does not replace the need to develop comprehensive, long-term inpatient and community-based approaches to the management of treatment refusal.\r"

METHOD: They interviewed 50 cocaine-dependent men consecutively admitted to a 28-day rehabilitation program. RESULTS: Thirty-four (68%) of the 50 men reported highly distressing transient paranoid states in the context of cocaine use. The men who experienced paranoia did not differ from those who did not in age, race, or measures of cocaine use. The mean duration and amount of cocaine use before development of paranoia of the men who reported paranoia were not significantly different from the mean lifetime duration and amount of cocaine used by the men who did not report paranoia. Paranoia became more severe and developed more rapidly with continued cocaine use. CONCLUSIONS: The transient paranoid state appears to be a common feature of cocaine dependence and does not seem to be simply a result of exceeding a threshold of use. Rather, affected individuals might possess a predisposition to this drug-induced state. The fact that paranoia became more severe and developed more rapidly with continued drug use is consistent with a sensitization model of cocaine-induced paranoia. In vulnerable individuals, limbic sensitization may underlie its expression, but localization to a specific brain region is speculative. Quantity of use and route of administration do not appear directly to predispose to this phenomenon. Future investigations must be aimed at uncovering the markers and meaning of vulnerability to transient paranoia in heavy cocaine users.\r"

METHOD: They measured the number of lymphocyte cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors and plasma cortisol concentrations in 15 consecutively admitted male combat Vietnam veterans with PTSD and in a normal comparison group of 11 subjects. RESULTS: Both the patients and the normal comparison subjects showed a morning-to-afternoon decline in glucocorticoid receptor concentrations, paralleling the normal diurnal decline in cortisol levels. The number of glucocorticoid receptors was 63% greater in the morning and 26% greater in the afternoon in the patients with PTSD than in the normal subjects. No group differences in cortisol levels were observed, nor were glucocorticoid receptor number and cortisol levels correlated. The number of morning glucocorticoid receptors was positively correlated with symptoms of PTSD and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide further evidence for a dysregulation of the HPA axis in PTSD. The finding that patients with PTSD had a substantially greater number of lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptors than normal comparison subjects is consistent with the authors' previous observations of low 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion in subjects with PTSD. Furthermore, the receptor changes observed are opposite of those reported in major depressive disorder. The present data, along with other findings of HPA abnormalities in PTSD, support the possibility of a greater negative feedback sensitivity at one or more levels of the HPA axis.\r"

METHOD: Twenty outpatients from the psychiatric department of a Barcelona hospital who were diagnosed as having nonendogenous (N = 9) or endogenous (N = 11) depression according to DSM-III criteria and the Newcastle scale participated in the study. The comparison group consisted of 12 healthy volunteers. Blood and saliva samples were taken before and after administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone Salivary cortisol and plasma ACTH concentrations were determined by direct iodine-125 radioimmunoassay with commercial kit reagents. RESULTS: Predexamethasone salivary cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in the group with endogenous depression than in the comparison group. A significant correlation was obtained between plasma ACTH and predexamethasone salivary cortisol levels in the group with nonendogenous depression and in the comparison subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate that salivary cortisol could substitute for plasma cortisol in clinical studies in which the DST and hypercortisolemia are evaluated. The lack of correlation between ACTH and cortisol levels in saliva in the group of endogenously depressed patients could indicate a disturbance in the regulation of cortisol secretion in major depression.\r"

METHOD: After recruitment through the media, 20 outpatients with seasonal affective disorder participated in a balanced-order crossover trial of 1 week of green light therapy compared with 1 week of red light therapy. Each treatment consisted of 2 hours of daily light treatment at home in the early morning. Ultraviolet light was excluded from both treatment conditions. The photon densities of the two treatments (2.3 x 10(15) photons/sec per cm2) were similar to those used in previous studies of therapy with 2500-lux white light. Fourteen patients completed the study. At least 1 week separated each treatment period to allow time for relapse. Effectiveness of treatment was assessed by analysis of variance of changes in ratings on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. RESULTS: Although patients' expectations of the two treatments were similar, green light induced greater antidepressant effects than red light. A Sequence by Color interaction was also demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Green light provides a treatment effect superior to that of red light and similar to that seen in previous studies with white light. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that retinal photoreceptors mediate the antidepressant response in seasonal affective disorder. Identifying optimal wavelengths for light treatment is important in optimizing phototherapy efficacy.\r"

RESULTS: After a relatively rapid dose reduction, the majority of patients relapsed. Rebound anxiety and withdrawal symptoms were identified in a substantial minority of patients. Those who were taking alprazolam showed earlier and more intense rebound anxiety and withdrawal symptoms than did the patients who received diazepam. Both the level of pretreatment anxiety and the drug the patient was taking predicted the level of anxiety when drug treatment was discontinued.

METHOD: The authors examined the first 204 consecutive cases from the San Diego Suicide Study, a federally funded investigation of 283 suicides, for possible relationships between suicide and age and the frequency of specific stressors. Information was gathered from family members, spouses, acquaintances, employers, other witnesses, physicians, and other professionals by trained interviewers using a structured format. Hospital, physician, therapist, school, and police records were also included when available. DSM-III diagnoses were made by consensus of two investigators. Life events information was also reviewed independently by the investigators to determine stressors (if any) for each case. RESULTS: Of the 202 subjects for whom data were available, 195 (97%) had one or more stressors; 137 male subjects had a total of 272 stressors, and 58 female subjects had a total of 115 stressors. The authors found predictable patterns of the three most common stressor groups--conflict-separation-rejection, economic problems, and medical illness. The majority of the stressors among subjects 80 years old or older were illnesses. The only significant difference between the sexes was that more men than women had economic problems as a stressor. CONCLUSIONS: The variations in the patterns of stressors found in this study of suicides coincide with adult development theory. The lack of population comparison subjects and stressor scoring validation, however, limits the predictive value of these data in assessing suicidal persons.\r"

  ".W": "Benefits from the use of glucose-containing intravenous and priming solutions during coronary artery bypass operation have not been documented, but an increased risk of postoperative neurologic deficit by hyperglycemia has been suggested. To determine benefits, 107 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operation were managed identically except that one group (n = 54) received 5% dextrose in lactated Ringer's solution (D5LR) as the sole intravenous and priming solution during operation and a second group (n = 53) received the same solution without glucose (LR). During cardiopulmonary bypass, the D5LR group required significantly less additional crystalloid to maintain safe oxygenator levels and flow (1.8 +/- 3.3 vs 15.8 +/- 20.9 mL.kg-1.h-1) and produced more urine (3.5 +/- 3.2 vs 1.2 +/- 1.4 mL.kg-1.h-1). By 24 h after operation, fluid balance in the LR group was approximately 2 L more positive than in the D5LR group. Five days after operation, the D5LR group weighed less than preoperatively (-0.8 +/- 2.6 kg), whereas the LR group gained weight (+1.0 +/- 2.8 kg). We conclude that use of glucose-containing solutions during coronary artery bypass operation benefits patients by decreasing perioperative fluid requirements and postoperative fluid retention. Because embolism is the cause of most postoperative neurologic deficits, any increased risk by hyperglycemia is small.\r"

The arrhythmogenic dose (AD) of isoproterenol was determined in the presence of various doses of phenylephrine during halothane anesthesia in dogs, and the influences of 1-metoprolol (beta 1-antagonist) and ICI-118,551 (beta 2-antagonist) on the AD were examined. In the presence of 1-metoprolol, the AD of isoproterenol was significantly greater than the control, but in the presence of ICI-118,551, the AD of isoproterenol was lower. Blood pressure during the arrhythmias was higher in the presence of ICI-118,551 than that in controls. In addition, the AD of ritodrine (beta 2-agonist) was also determined at various doses of phenylephrine. The interaction between phenylephrine and ritodrine in inducing arrhythmias showed hyperbolic isoboles. However, 1-metoprolol completely inhibited the occurrence of arrhythmias induced by ritodrine and phenylephrine. The results suggest that myocardial beta 1-adrenoceptors play an essential role in the genesis of arrhythmias during halothane anesthesia in dogs, whereas beta 2-adrenoceptors do not.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the interactions of atelectasis and halothane on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction using an isolated canine lobe. We divided pulmonary vascular resistance into arterial, venous, and middle segmental resistances by a vascular occlusion technique. We found that middle segmental resistance significantly increased (P less than 0.05) from 0.016 +/- 0.007 cm H2O.mL-1.min-1 during normoxic ventilation to 0.06 +/- 0.007 cm H2O.mL-1.min-1 during hypoxic ventilation. We then produced sublobar atelectasis by introducing 4.5-mm steel ball bearings into the lobar bronchus, which resulted in a significant increase (P less than 0.05) of middle segmental resistance to 0.046 +/- 0.014 cm H2O.mL-1.min-1 during normoxic ventilation and a further significant increase (P less than 0.05) to 0.084 +/- 0.02 cm H2O.mL-1.min-1 during hypoxic ventilation. Ventilation with 2.0% halothane but not 0.5% halothane prevented the increases in middle segmental resistance observed with either atelectasis or hypoxic ventilation. Values of arterial and venous segmental resistances were not similarly affected. We conclude that sublobar atelectasis increases pulmonary vascular resistance by stimulating hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Both halothane and hypoxia primarily act upon the middle vascular segment, but their effects are in opposite directions and, in the former instance, are concentration-dependent.\r"

Two hundred eighty-seven patients undergoing minor elective procedures under general anesthesia were studied. Four to six hours after anesthesia each patient completed a questionnaire assessing his or her own alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine consumption, and the occurrence of postoperative side effects. A highly significant difference was found between the caffeine consumption of patients with and without preoperative (P = 0.0035) and postoperative (P less than 0.0001) headache. Logistic regression analysis of trend between headache and caffeine consumption suggested that with each 100-mg increase in caffeine consumption, there was a 12% increase in the odds of headache developing in the immediate preoperative period (P less than 0.0066) and a 16% increase in the odds of postoperative headache developing (P less than 0.0001). No relationship was found between headache and the patients' age, sex, usual frequency of headache, consumption of alcohol or nicotine, or the anesthetic agents or adjuvants used. It is concluded that postoperative headache is related to caffeine intake and that this relationship is explained, at least in part, by a perioperative caffeine withdrawal syndrome.\r"

Relief of vasoconstriction can improve blood flow to the heart. The purpose of this study was to determine if 1.5 MAC halothane and 1.5 MAC isoflurane would each attenuate contractions evoked by three putative mediators of coronary constriction in coronary arteries removed from the hearts of human beings. Hearts were obtained in the operating room from five patients undergoing cardiac transplantation and from six brain-dead patients undergoing organ donation procedures. Coronary arteries were dissected free, cut into rings, and studied in organ chambers. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to 10(-6) M bradykinin were examined; they indicated a variable degree of endothelial dysfunction in vessels used in the experiments. Contractile responses to 40 mM KCl were tested and were used as control contractions. Contractions evoked by serotonin, histamine, and prostaglandin F2 alpha were measured and were expressed as a percent of contractile responses evoked by 40 mM KCl. Halothane depressed the agonist-induced contractions. Maximal contractile responses to serotonin were 130% +/- 28% in untreated rings and 63% +/- 10% in rings exposed to halothane (P less than 0.03). Responses to histamine were 183% +/- 46% untreated and 121% +/- 26% during halothane administration (P less than 0.05), and responses to prostaglandin F2 alpha were 227% +/- 42% untreated and 148% +/- 18% with halothane (P less than 0.05). Isoflurane had no effect on contractions. The results demonstrate that 1.5 MAC halothane, but not 1.5 MAC isoflurane, attenuates contractile responses evoked by putative mediators of coronary vasoconstriction in coronary arteries removed from the hearts of human beings.\r"

To examine this, two groups of rabbits were injected intraperitoneally twice a day with either 1 mg/kg verapamil or saline for 28 days. Fourteen hours after the last dose, right atrial tissue and right ventricular papillary muscle were isolated. Plasma and myocardial tissue concentrations of verapamil were determined. Plasma samples contained no detectable amounts of verapamil, but the myocardium contained 2.1 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SE) ng of verapamil per gram of wet tissue. Spontaneous action potentials recorded from the sinoatrial node in the verapamil-treated group showed decreases in the phase 0 and phase 4 depolarization rates, a slower pacemaker rate, and an attenuated response to epinephrine compared with the saline-treated group. Papillary muscle in the verapamil-treated group exhibited a significantly lower force of contraction and a depressed contractile response to epinephrine compared with the control group. There were no differences in rate or contractile responses the day after single injection with 2 mg/kg verapamil or saline twice a day. Myocardial verapamil concentration increased with the duration of treatment and with the doses given; myocardial verapamil concentration was 3.0 +/- 0.6 ng/g wet tissue in the group treated for 28 days with 2 mg/kg verapamil. Our study shows that chronic treatment of rabbits with verapamil decreases cardiac chronotropic and inotropic responses to adrenergic stimuli despite no detectable verapamil in plasma, and that accumulation of verapamil in the myocardium is probably associated with these effects.\r"

Ten ASA physical status I and II adults anesthetized with thiopental, nitrous oxide, and alfentanil were given 0.4 mg/kg atracurium besylate. The force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle in response to train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve was recorded. When the first twitch (T1) of the train-of-four recovered to 10% of control, an atracurium infusion was started and adjusted to keep the level of blockade constant. After 15 min of stable blockade, 1.6%-1.7% end-tidal enflurane was started and maintained for up to 2 h. Venous blood samples were drawn and plasma atracurium concentrations were measured 15 min before and 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after the introduction of enflurane. Atracurium plasma concentrations were 730 +/- 127 (SEM) ng/mL at time 0. During the first 30 min, no significant decrease in plasma levels occurred; but at 45 min, concentrations were only 67% +/- 8% of their initial value (P less than 0.01) and 48% +/- 2% at 120 min (P less than 0.01). This suggests that the interaction between enflurane and atracurium is time-dependent. Clinically, the interaction between atracurium and enflurane is negligible during procedures of less than 45 min.\r"

We examined the single and combined direct cardiac effects of amiodarone and halothane in the isolated guinea pig heart. Guinea pig hearts were isolated and perfused retrogradely through the aorta with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer solution at 37 degrees C at constant pressure (55 mm Hg). Variables measured in 61 hearts included spontaneous heart rate (HR), atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT), isovolumetric left ventricular pressure (LVP), and coronary flow (CF). Amiodarone was administered as a single bolus into the retrogradely perfused aortic root and halothane was vaporized into the perfusing solution. Mean control values of pooled data before treatment were as follows: HR, 228 +/- 4 (SEM) beats/min; AVCT (during atrial pacing at 240 beats/min), 82 +/- 2 ms; LVP, 97 +/- 4 mm Hg; and CF, 6.1 +/- 0.2 mL.min-1.g-1. Amiodarone, 100 micrograms and 200 micrograms, decreased HR by 8% +/- 2% and 8% +/- 2%, increased AVCT by 5 +/- 2 and 15 +/- 3 ms, decreased LVP by 22% +/- 3% and 27% +/- 3%, and increased CF by 20% +/- 1% and 40% +/- 2%, respectively; all these changes were sustained for 60 min and, except for HR, were dose dependent. Halothane, 0.5% and 1%, transiently and dose-dependently decreased HR by 6% +/- 2% and 12% +/- 2% increased AVCT by 4 +/- 2 and 8 +/- 2 ms, decreased LVP by 15% +/- 3% and 31% +/- 3%, and increased CF by 2% +/- 1% and 6% +/- 2%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seventeen pediatric patients were anesthetized with CACI using age-appropriate pharmacokinetic models for administering sufentanil and midazolam. Predicted CACI plasma concentrations were correlated with assayed plasma drug concentrations at eight predefined intervals. The accuracy was assessed using median absolute prediction error. We found that plasma levels predicted by CACI provided a reasonable approximation of measured plasma concentrations for both drugs. The median absolute prediction error for sufentanil during cardiopulmonary bypass was compared with measurements made off of cardiopulmonary bypass (both pre and post cardiopulmonary bypass) and were 49% and 32%, respectively, and for midazolam 44% and 32%, respectively. We conclude that (a) current kinetic models provide a reasonable estimate of plasma drug concentrations, and (b) the ease of administration and targeted plasma level provided by the CACI system is an alternative to inhalation anesthesia using calibrated vaporizers.\r"

The authors reasoned that some degree of diaphragm paralysis should result from interscalene blocks that produce surgical C3-C5 sensory anesthesia. In this investigation, ultrasonography was used to study the incidence of ipsilateral hemidiaphragmatic paresis during routine interscalene block, as it is a practical, sensitive, and low-risk method for diagnosing hemidiaphragmatic function without radiation exposure. Thirteen healthy patients received interscalene blocks using a paresthesia technique with 34-52 mL 1.5% mepivacaine with added epinephrine and bicarbonate. All developed cervical sensory anesthesia. Data were collected before and 2, 5, and 10 min after injection, and, when possible (11 of 13 patients), at hourly intervals after surgery. Changes from normal to paradoxical motion of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm were seen in all 13 patients during sniff and Mueller maneuvers within 5 min (in 11 of 13 patients at 2 min). Diaphragmatic motion returned to normal in 10 of 11 patients between 3 and 4 h after injection and in the remaining patient by the fifth hour after injection. Diaphragmatic paresis appears to be an inevitable consequence of interscalene brachial plexus block when providing anesthesia sufficient for shoulder surgery.\r"

This study was designed to investigate neuromuscular transmission in 91 ASA physical status I or II day-care children (aged 0-10 yr) after halothane anesthesia in which pancuronium (n = 34), atracurium (n = 32), or vecuronium (n = 25) was administered. Peripheral nerve stimulation was used clinically to assess neuromuscular blockade during surgery. In the recovery room, the evoked response of the adductor pollicis muscle was measured by train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. This measurement was made (mean +/- SEM) at 18.0 +/- 1.5, 15.0 +/- 1.3, and 15.0 +/- 1.7 min after pharmacologic antagonism with 0.02 mg/kg atropine and 0.06 mg/kg neostigmine in the pancuronium, atracurium, and vecuronium groups, respectively. There were no differences in the ages of the patients in the three groups at 4.3 +/- 0.4, 4.0 +/- 0.4, and 5.0 +/- 0.5 yr, with 17 children less than 2 yr. Recovery from neuromuscular blockade in all three groups was almost complete. The train-of-four ratio (height of fourth twitch compared with the first) was similar in patients who had received pancuronium (96.7% +/- 0.9%), atracurium (95.5% +/- 0.9%), or vecuronium (96.3% +/- 1.3%). Therefore, postoperative muscle weakness or respiratory impairment is unlikely in pediatric day-care surgical patients more than 2 yr old when these anesthetic techniques are used.\r"

  ".W": "Levels of sensory (pinprick) and somatic motor blockade were measured in a double-blind study of 30 volunteers given single epidural injections of 1%, 0.75%, and 0.5% ropivacaine. Onset of analgesia was rapid with all concentrations (7-10 min). Maximal levels of analgesia were established 60 min after injection, with no significant differences in the maximal median cephalad spread. Duration of analgesia at the T-12 level and total duration were significantly longer with 1% and 0.75% than with 0.5% ropivacaine. Motor blockade was assessed by a quantitative method (measurements of isometric muscle force) and a qualitative method (modified Bromage scale). Onset of motor blockade measured by the quantitative method was significantly slower with 0.5% ropivacaine than with the higher concentrations. Maximal muscle weakness occurred 1-1.5 h after injection with all three concentrations. With increase in ropivacaine dose from 100 to 200 mg, the intensity and duration of motor blockade increased. Muscles involved in knee extension were blocked most, those of plantar flexion least. Recovery of motor function, assessed by the above-mentioned quantitative method, occurred simultaneously with the recovery of pinprick perception. Motor blockade registered by Bromage scale showed a slower onset for 0.5% ropivacaine than for the higher concentrations. Mean durations of grade 1 and 2 block were longest for the 1% solution. Motor blockade described by the Bromage scale showed only the first part of the regression phase. Full recovery of muscle strength (Bromage scale = 0) was attained 1.5-2.5 h earlier than assessed by the quantitative method. No adverse effects were registered.\r"

Adequacy of pain relief was measured by the amount of patient-controlled analgesia morphine required postoperatively and by patient scores on a visual analog scale obtained every sixth hour. Two venous blood samples for measurements of serum bupivacaine levels were obtained from patients in the continuous group at hours 6 and 24; four blood samples were obtained from patients in the bolus group, both immediately before and 30 min after injections at hours 6 and 24. Among the patients receiving the bolus injections, morphine was required 62 +/- 15 (SEM) times over the 24-h study period with total morphine dosage averaging 30 +/- 15 mg. Corresponding values for patients in the continuous groups were 35 +/- 10 times and 23 +/- 5 mg of morphine. The difference was not, however, statistically significant, but when activity during the 2-h time periods immediately before reinjection were examined, patients in the bolus group required and received significantly more morphine than did those in the continuous group (P less than 0.05). Patients in the continuous group had visual analog scale scores that averaged 2.9 +/- 0.6 over the 24-h study period. Patients within the bolus group had visual analog scale scores before and again 30 min after injection that averaged 5.8 +/- 0.8 and 1.8 +/- 0.5, respectively (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the first complaint of pain in the Postanesthesia Care Unit, patients received a single epidural bolus of 30 micrograms sufentanil (group A), 5 mg morphine (group B), or 30 micrograms sufentanil plus 3 mg morphine (group C) in a randomized blinded fashion. Analgesic efficacy was assessed throughout the 24-h study period with 10-cm visual analog scales. The need for additional postoperative analgesia (patient-controlled analgesia, 1 mg of morphine every 6 min as necessary) and the incidence of adverse effects were also assessed. Patients receiving sufentanil (groups A and C) had significantly faster onset of analgesia than did patients given morphine alone (group B, P less than 0.05). Group B subjects experienced the longest duration of analgesia (B vs A and C, P less than 0.05) and required significantly less patient-controlled analgesia (morphine) than patients in group A (P less than 0.05). No patient developed clinically significant respiratory depression or excessive sedation, and there were no intergroup differences in incidence of pruritus or nausea (P value not significant). The data indicate that a mixture of sufentanil and morphine provides either a more rapid onset of epidural analgesia or reduced patient-controlled analgesia narcotic requirement than respective doses of each agent administered alone.\r"

The volunteers were randomly divided into three groups: group 1 (n = 10) received 240 mL water, group 2 (n = 10) received 240 mL coffee, and group 3 (n = 10) received 240 mL pulp-free orange juice. All liquids were administered orally. Gastric contents were then again aspirated, measured for volume and pH, and reinserted through the nasogastric tube every half hour until gastric volume was less than 25 mL. All volunteers had gastric volumes less than 25 mL with a slight decrease in pH within 2 h of orally taking one of the three 240-mL liquids. These data suggest that if patients have ingested a moderate amount of clear liquids it is safe to conduct general anesthesia after a 2-h fast in healthy surgical patients.\r"

It is important, therefore, to know whether other H2-blockers also affect the cerebral circulation adaptation to hypoxia. Cerebral blood flow was measured in 24 awake dogs after an intravenous injection of either saline (control) or one of three H2-blockers: 1 mg/kg ranitidine, 0.4 mg/kg famotidine, or 1 mg/kg roxatidine. These doses are equipotent blockers of H2-gastric receptors. Each dog was studied during normoxia and after 2 and 4 h of normocapnic hypoxia (FIO2, 0.10; FICO2, 0.035). During each set of experimental conditions, a bolus of either saline or one of the anti-H2 drugs was administered, and, 15 min later, radiolabeled microspheres (ruthenium 103, scandium 46, and cerium 141) were injected into the left atrium for measurement of regional CBF. After death by an overdose of thiopental, each dog's brain was excised and fixed in 10% formaldehyde; it was then weighed and dissected by region, with the radioactivity measured in each region using a gamma counter. During hypoxia, PaO2 ranged from 45 to 50 mm Hg, and pH, PaCO2, and hematocrit were within the normal limits. In the control group CBF increased 34% above normoxic baseline levels after 2 h and 31% after 4 h of hypoxia. Ranitidine (1 mg/kg) did not prevent the increase in CBF during hypoxia, but famotidine and roxatidine prevented it. When the dose of ranitidine was doubled (2 mg/kg), it too abolished the increase of CBF induced by hypoxia. In conclusion, H2-receptor blockers could interfere with the adaptation of CBF during hypoxia.\r"

Besides a decrease in plasma fibrinogen and fibrinopeptide A (p less than 0.001 both), bezafibrate induced a reduction of factor VIIc and VIIIc activity (p less than 0.001 both), while antithrombin 3 activity was increased (p less than 0.001) and the hemorheologic pattern was greatly improved (p less than 0.001). Simvastatin caused a slight decrease in factor VIIIc activity and a moderate reduction of beta-thromboglobulin. The efficacy of bezafibrate in reducing the activation of the coagulative cascade and improving the hemorheologic pattern has been confirmed; the peculiar triglycerides- and fibrinogen-lowering effect of the drug, not observed with simvastatin, could be responsible for these modifications.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine whether a microcirculatory deficit was induced in the skin by raising the venous pressure proximally for thirty minutes. Seventeen subjects with no evidence of venous or arterial disease had laser Doppler velocimetry performed in the goiter region of the leg; 8 different subjects had the measurement done on the dorsum of the hand. Peak hyperemic response following three minutes of ischemia was measured before and after a thirty-minute period of sustained venous hypertension applied by a proximal tourniquet inflated to 80 mm Hg. A decrease in the peak flow: baseline flow ratio (median ratio 2.25 before, 1.70 after, p less than 0.02) and an increase in the time taken to reach maximal hyperemia (median time ten seconds before, twenty seconds after, p less than 0.01) were observed after the period of venous hypertension in the lower limb. The second parameter, but not the first, was significantly affected in the upper limb. The authors conclude that a microvascular deficit in the skin is demonstrable after a short period of venous hypertension. This is consistent with the white-cell-trapping theory, but other possible explanations are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Perivascular innervation in cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats and of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats was studied. Adrenergic nerve fibers and neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers, indicative of vasoconstrictor nerves, were denser in all cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats than those of Wistar-Kyoto rats. In contrast, cholinergic nerve fibers and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, substance P-containing nerve fibers, indicative of vasodilator nerves, remained unchanged in all cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats, as compared with findings in the Wistar-Kyoto rats. Thus, not only adrenergic nerve fibers but also neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers may play an important role in preventing the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the development of hypertensive encephalopathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"
