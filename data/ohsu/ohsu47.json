Four patients with more extensive ureteral loss underwent a Boari flap procedure, and of the 8 patients with major ureteral loss 6 had small bowel interposition and 2 have had renal autotransplantation to compensate for lost ureteral length. All patients are well with stable renal function at 1 to 7-year followup.\r"

Traditionally, a 2-stage approach to correct these defects has been used. However, more recently a 1-stage repair with correction of chordee and creation of a neourethra has increased in popularity. From 1978 to 1985 we treated 86 patients with moderately severe hypospadias and chordee with a 1-stage technique using either a transverse island pedicle flap, a Hodgson III hypospadias repair or a free preputial skin graft. Despite an over-all complication rate of 50 per cent, our final results based on cosmesis and function were deemed excellent in 90 per cent of the cases. Of the 44 complications 23 were strictures, most frequently at the proximal anastomosis. Two-thirds of these strictures responded to a single dilation with the patient under anesthesia. Our fistula rate was 10 per cent and flap necrosis, meatal stenosis or prolapse and residual chordee accounted for the remaining 12 complications. Our experience indicates that a 1-stage repair for moderately severe hypospadias and chordee can be performed in patients with a satisfactory success rate of more than 90 per cent, minimal morbidity and an acceptable complication rate.\r"

In remaining mice (no. = 62) the bladder was simply touched without suture insertion. Thirty-two animals treated with FANFT and 33 treated with FANFT + sutures also received supplements to their drinking water throughout the experiment of the sulfhydryl-reducing agent N-acetylcysteine (500 mg./kg. body weight/day). Seven weeks following FANFT treatment, bladder cancers developed in 12% of mice with sutures and FANFT and in 19% of those with sutures, FANFT, and N-acetylcysteine. No cancers developed in mice receiving FANFT alone or FANFT with N-acetylcysteine and none in mice treated with sutures only.

  ".W": "Within the past few years, veno-occlusion of the corpora cavernosa has become generally recognized as an essential prerequisite for adequate penile erection. Veno-occlusive incompetence is suspected to be a frequent cause of impotence. Our recent experience with cavernosography in two normal volunteers and 36 impotent patients indicates that angiography is reliable in evaluating the competence of the veno-occlusive mechanism only if both pharmacocavernosography (PCG) and pharmacocavernosometry (PCM) are applied. Twenty minutes after intracavernosal (IC) injection of a mixture of 60 mg. papaverine and one mg. phentolamine (regitine), 100 ml. of diluted radiographic contrast medium are infused at the rate of one or two ml./sec. while pressure is recorded, and radiographic films are exposed at the rate of one every eight to 15 seconds. PCM and PCG of the corpora cavernosa indicated the overall degree of competence of the cavernosal veno-occlusive mechanisms, and the sites of veno-occlusive incompetence; non-pharmacologic studies were unreliable in these regards. During non-pharmacologic infusion in normals, pressures rose to 40 to 45 mm. Hg, and free efflux could be visualized from multiple venous systems. After pharmacologic injection in normals, all venous channels closed, and pressures rapidly rose toward or above 200 mm. Hg, at which time the infusion was stopped. Veno-occlusive incompetence was defined angiographically when more than minimal efflux occurred during pharmacocavernosography from any venous system. The incompetence could involve the deep penile system, the deep dorsal system, or the spongiosal system, alone or in combination. Severe veno-occlusive incompetence was considered diagnostic of venogenic impotence, and was defined manometrically when IC pressures failed to exceed 100 mm. Hg during infusion of 100 ml. of fluid at 2 mm./second after IC papaverine and phentolamine injection. We believe these angiographic methods will improve the criteria against which other diagnostic and therapeutic methods can be assessed.\r"

This can be achieved by intravesical chemotherapy immediately after the resection of the bladder tumors. We have demonstrated, in an in-vitro system, the process of human bladder tumor cell implantation on a naturally produced extracellular matrix (ECM) which simulates the exposed bladder basement membrane and submucosa. Using this model we examined the efficacy of various cytotoxic agents in preventing tumor cell adhesion to the ECM. Human bladder tumor cell implantation was prevented following exposure of the cells to distilled water, epodyl or mitomycin C, and significantly reduced following one hour incubation in cisplatinum and doxorubicin. The maximal effect for each of these cytotoxic agents was reached within 30 to 60 minutes of treatment. Mitomycin C reached maximal effect within 10 minutes. In contrast, thiotepa did not cause a significant reduction in cell adherence to ECM as compared to untreated control cells.\r"

The growth of these tumors, as measured by increases in volume, was compared to that of a castrate control group, a chronic implant group and an intact control group. By the end of an initial 49 day experimental period there was no significant growth reduction with the intermittent stimulation group as compared to the implanted control or intact groups. The castrate group had a significant lower rate of growth than any other group. The incidence of massive tumor growth or tumor necrosis was significantly lower in the castrate group than the other groups by the end of the 16 week experimental period. Intermittent hormonal therapy is clearly inferior to early castration in preventing tumor growth; furthermore it does not appear to offer any growth-retarding advantages when compared to delayed hormone therapy. The most effective growth-retarding technique for the Dunning R3327H hormone dependent prostatic adenocarcinoma is early castration.\r"

  ".W": "In isolated bladder smooth muscle from both rabbit and man, carbachol-induced contractions were reduced by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, whereas the calcium channel promotor Bay K 8644 had no effect. In nominally calcium-free medium containing 10(-4) M EGTA, carbachol-induced contractions were reduced by 69% (rabbit) and 87% (man). These contractions were abolished by nifedipine, whereas Bay K 8644 significantly increased their amplitude, in rabbit preparations almost to control level. Electrical field stimulation produced contractions which could be suppressed by scopolamine by about 50% (rabbit) and more than 90% (man). These contractions were abolished by calcium-free medium (10(-4) M EGTA), suppressed by nifedipine, but significantly enhanced by Bay K 8644. The depressant effects of nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem were reversed by Bay K 8644. The calcium channel blockers relaxed K+-induced contractions to base line, and this action was counteracted by Bay K 8644, less effectively when relaxations were induced by diltiazem. It is concluded that contractions produced by muscarinic receptor stimulation are primarily dependent on calcium bound to the outside of the membrane of the smooth muscle, and/or coming from the extracellular medium. Electrically evoked, scopolamine sensitive contractions seem to be mediated by a mechanism different from that of contractions produced by exogenously added muscarinic receptor agonist. The present data support the view that combined blockade of muscarinic receptors and calcium channels is an effective way of inhibiting bladder contractions in both rabbit and man.\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports have demonstrated that endothelial cell seeding of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts enhances short-term patency. This experiment was undertaken to study its impact on the long-term patency of a highly porous, experimental PTFE graft and to determine whether increasing the internodal distance of the graft material resulted in increased proliferation of the subendothelium. Ten centimeter long, 4 mm internal diameter segments of an unreinforced, experimental PTFE graft were implanted into 36 mongrel dogs as carotid interpositions. In each animal, one graft was seeded with autologous endothelial cells, enzymatically derived from the external jugular veins, whereas the contralateral graft was treated in identical fashion except that endothelial cells were not added to the preclot mixture. Nineteen animals were killed at 12 weeks; six at 22 weeks; eight at 26 weeks; and three at 52 weeks. The mean follow-up period was 20.1 weeks. The overall patency rate was 58.3% (21 of 36 grafts) for seeded grafts vs. 27.8% (10 of 36 grafts) for control grafts (p less than 0.01). The thrombus-free area was planimetrically measured at 83.4% +/- 4.5% in seeded grafts vs. 55.1% +/- 9.7% in control grafts (p less than 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of a confluent cellular monolayer in seeded grafts, whereas control grafts exhibited a variable coagulum of fibrin, platelets, and endothelial cells. The thickness of the subendothelial layer varied from 56 to 95 micron with no progressive increase in thickness between 12 and 52 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A continuous-wave (CW) Doppler probe was mounted at a 45-degree angle to the flow and passed transversely over the tube by a motorized drive mechanism at a rate of 0.42 mm/sec. Flow rates through the tubes were monitored with electromagnetic flow probes. The maximum depth from which quantitatively reliable signals could be obtained was 1.2 cm for 10 MHz probes and 3.3 cm for 5 MHz probes. Qualitative detection of flow was possible to a depth of 3.1 cm for 10 MHz probes and 7.0 cm for 5 MHz probes. The distances from the tube center for obtaining quantitatively reliable signals were limited to +/- 0.9 mm with a 10 MHz probe and +/- 1.8 mm with a 5 MHz probe. Qualitatively useful signals could be detected +/- 2.9 mm from the beam center by the 10 MHz probes and +/- 4.4 mm by the 5 MHz probes indicating a need for cautious interpretation as an interfering signal might be generated by any vessel within that range. Twenty percent of the randomly tested CW probes were considered unsuitable for use in quantitating blood flow, which underscores the importance of probe characterization before use.\r"

  ".W": "A recent experience with infrainguinal graft infections was reviewed in an effort to identify factors related to limb loss and mortality. The records of 32 patients who had operative treatment of 33 episodes of infrainguinal graft infection between 1978 and 1985 were reviewed to evaluate the effects of 20 factors possibly affecting outcome. The amputation rate was 79%. Of the 20 factors studied, only the presence of overt limb sepsis was associated with the need for amputation, with 100% of patients having limb sepsis requiring amputation vs. 72% of patients without limb sepsis (p = 0.03). The in-hospital mortality rate was 22%. Eighty-six percent of the deaths were due to ongoing sepsis. Again, a single factor was associated with death. Five of the 12 patients (42%) in whom preservation of axial flow was attempted died in contrast to only 2 of 20 patients (10%) who did not have attempted arterial reconstruction (p = 0.04). Limb salvage did not occur in any of the patients in whom preservation of axial flow was attempted and nine required above-knee amputation. Thirteen of the remaining 20 patients had occluded femoral vessels either because of operative ligation (nine) or previous thrombosis (four). Above-knee amputations healed in all but one of these 13 patients. Determined attempts at increasing limb preservation were associated with no improvement in amputation rate or level and were accompanied by an unacceptably high mortality rate. Aggressive control of sepsis through the early amputation of septic limbs after graft removal may improve survival without further detriment to limb preservation.\r"

Seventy patients were male and 46 were female; ages ranged from 31 to 92 years (mean 68 years). The operative mortality rate after the second amputation was 9.5% (11 of 116 patients). The time from the first to second amputation ranged from zero to 144 months (mean 23 months). Follow-up from 1 to 14 years was available on all patients. Sixty percent of the patients surviving the postoperative period were alive at 2 years and 40% at 5 years. Of the 105 patients available for follow-up, only 27 (26%) were able to use bilateral prostheses. Twenty-three (85%) of these patients were ambulatory after their first amputation. Four patients not walking after their first amputation became ambulatory after their second. All four had bilateral below-knee amputations. Of the 78 patients unable to use a bilateral prosthesis, 68 (87%) were able to function independently and 10 became bedridden. Successful prosthetic rehabilitation in the bilateral amputee appears primarily dependent on the use of a prosthesis after the first amputation. The acceptable long-term survival and the number of patients who became independent in their activities justify an aggressive approach to the rehabilitation of the bilateral amputee.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine what percentage of patients could avoid the transfusion of any homologous bank blood products during elective abdominal aortic surgery with a recently developed semicontinuous, rapid autotransfusion device. Fifty patients (26 with abdominal aortic aneurysms and 24 with aortic occlusive disease) prospectively received intraoperative autologous transfusion (group 1) and were matched for comparison with 50 patients receiving homologous blood without use of any autotransfusion equipment (group 2). For the entire perioperative period, 34 group 1 patients (68%) received only their own autotransfused blood and no other homologous blood components compared with group 2 in which 48 patients (96%) required some bank blood (p less than 0.0001). Rapid autotransfusion reduced usage of homologous red cell transfusion by 75%. The mean postoperative hemoglobin was similar in both groups (group 1, 11.91 gm/dl vs. group 2, 11.90 gm/dl, p = 0.73). Rapid autotransfusion was not associated with significant hemolysis, air embolism, or coagulopathy and did not increase morbidity or death. By eliminating the need for any bank blood components in most patients, rapid autotransfusion minimizes the risk of blood-borne diseases and transfusion reactions. New rapid autotransfusion devices offer a distinct advantage over past equipment and allow significant changes in current transfusion practices during elective abdominal aortic reconstructions.\r"

A modified gastroscope tipped with an echocardiographic transducer was inserted into the esophagus and positioned behind the heart to obtain a reproducible cross-sectional view of the left ventricle at the level of the papillary muscles. Twelve patients (24%) had SWMA at baseline, probably representing areas of old infarction. Fourteen patients (28%) had new intraoperative SWMAs. Ten of 14 patients were successfully treated and wall motion was normalized. One of the four patients with persistent SWMA suffered a nonfatal subendocardial infarct; another patient suffered intraoperative cardiac arrest and died. No infarcts were documented in the 10 patients successfully treated. The mortality rate in the entire high-risk group was 6%. Alterations in ventricular wall motion were noted in almost 50% of high-risk patients undergoing major vascular surgery. Seventy-one percent of acute SWMAs were reversed without any evidence of myocardial infarction. TEE allowed early recognition of evolving myocardial ischemia and facilitated immediate and specific fluid and pharamcologic interventions. Continued application of this technique may reduce the incidence and morbidity of perioperative cardiac complications.\r"

This study compared the early changes in intimal morphology and fibrinolytic activity of in situ and reversed vein bypass grafts from mongrel dogs. Four to six centimeter in situ and reversed vein segments were used to bypass left and right femoral and internal carotid arteries, respectively. Heparin (100 U/kg) was administered before arterial clamping. Anastomoses were fashioned end to side and the intervening artery was ligated. Fifty-two grafts were harvested at day 1 (12 grafts), day 7 (16 grafts), day 14 (12 grafts), and 12 weeks (12 grafts). The veins were analyzed for histologic changes by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The fibrinolytic activity of the grafts was assayed by the fibrin slide and fibrin plate techniques. There were no significant differences in morphology or fibrinolytic activity between the reversed and in situ grafts at any time period. These findings indicate that the improved patency rates associated with in situ grafts are not dependent on improved preservation of intimal structure or fibrinolytic activity.\r"

  ".W": "To define the benefits and risks of renal revascularization or nephrectomy in patients with both severe hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency, we analyzed 98 patients who underwent renovascular operations after serum creatinine levels exceeded 2 mg/dl. This subset of patients was selected from a retrospective review of 652 renal operations performed at the Mayo Clinic for renovascular disease between 1970 and 1981. Special attention was given to the type of operations, their effect on hypertension and renal function, specific factors that affected operative deaths, and late survival. Unilateral renal operations were performed in 48 patients with bilateral procedures in 50. Simultaneous aortic reconstruction was necessary in 55 patients (56%). Postoperative diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg in 55% of patients and 90 to 100 mm Hg in an additional 33%. Seventy-six percent of patients required less antihypertension medication. Serum creatinine improved or stabilized in 69%. Ninety percent of patients avoided any early or late renal dialysis. The operative mortality rate was 7.1% and tended to be higher in patients with a serum creatinine greater than 3 mg/dl and in those with past myocardial infarction (p = 0.05). The late survival rate was 64% at 5 years. The main cause of operative and late death was myocardial infarction. In conclusion, most patients with renovascular hypertension and early chronic renal insufficiency can be benefited by surgical revascularization or nephrectomy. Future improvement in early and late survival may require a more aggressive approach to the identification and correction of significant coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".U": "87170007\r", 
  ".W": "Neurologic deficits evident when patients initially awaken from surgery are generally due to intraoperative embolization or inadequate cerebral protection in patients with marginal cerebral perfusion; neurologic deficits occurring in the immediate postoperative period are usually related to acute carotid occlusion or embolization. However, in a small subset of patients, transient postoperative neurologic dysfunction seems to be related to a syndrome of cerebral hyperperfusion rather than a lack of adequate cerebral blood flow. This study describes the courses of 10 patients with classic findings of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome. Typically, this syndrome occurred in patients with longstanding severe chronic cerebral ischemia and occurred after correction of a very high-grade carotid stenosis. Intraoperatively, there was often a dramatic increase in xenon-labeled cerebral blood flows, with postocclusion flows sometimes attaining three to four times baseline levels. Postoperatively, the patients initially did well. However, over the next several days, many of them began to complain of unilateral headache on the operated side and subsequently had seizures. Electroencephalography obtained during this period uniformly revealed periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges on the side of the brain ipsilateral to the endarterectomy. Although neurologic dysfunction fully resolved in all of the patients in this group, it is possible that intracerebral hemorrhage may occur in some patients with hyperperfusion syndrome. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is believed to be related to preoperative loss of cerebral autoregulatory mechanisms caused by chronic cerebral ischemia.\r"

Vascular tissue fusion by laser occurs at energy levels lower than those required to coagulate or vaporize. CO2, argon, and Nd:YAG (1.06 micron) lasers have all been reported to fuse anastomoses in microvessels, but adequate welding of larger veins and arteries (3 to 8 mm in diameter) has only been accomplished with the argon laser. Laser welds heal comparably to sutured wounds but do not have the chronic foreign body reaction and disorientation of elastin and collagen associated with sutures. Preliminary evidence suggests that argon laser-welded anastomoses have less intimal hyperplasia than sutured anastomoses. Laser welding may also be a useful adjunct for sealing intimal flaps during endarterectomy. Additional work is needed to determine the mechanism, optimal parameters, and wavelengths required for vascular tissue fusion by laser. Direct application of laser light intraluminally has thus far been associated with a high incidence of vessel perforation. Angioscopy-assisted delivery of a metal hot-tip probe shows promise for angioplasty of occluded medium-sized arteries and for valvulotomy in in situ vein bypasses.\r"

The proportion of women with AIDS in this risk group increased significantly between 1982 and 1986, from 12% to 26%. This trend may prove to be a good marker for following trends in heterosexual transmission. Since the majority of childhood AIDS cases are a result of perinatal transmission from the mother, trends in AIDS cases in women may also predict future trends for AIDS in children.\r"

Fifty-five homosexual men and 19 heterosexual men had four- to six-week postimmunization antibody responses measured to trivalent influenza vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. The homosexual men were divided into three groups: 20 asymptomatic HIV-seronegative men, 10 asymptomatic HIV-seropositive men, and 25 HIV-seropositive men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. Antibody responses to influenza antigens in the subgroups of homosexual men did not significantly differ from those of heterosexual controls. The IgG antibody responses to pneumococcal capsular types 9N and 18C in men with lymphadenopathy, and type 18C in HIV-seronegative homosexual men, were lower than those of heterosexual controls. Otherwise, responses to other ten capsular types showed no significant differences. There was no evidence of an immunosuppressive effect of vaccination on T-cell numbers, or deterioration of clinical status associated with vaccination. This study demonstrates that HIV-infected homosexual men, asymptomatic or with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, are able to mount appropriate antibody responses to two commonly used vaccines.\r"

To determine the effect of the intervention on medicine-clinic operation, we monitored the hospital outpatient activity of 28 residents and 2299 patients during an 11-month study period. The group-practice clinics generated 20% more patient encounters per month than did the traditional, control clinics (328 vs 273 encounters), primarily because twice as many voluntary, overflow clinic sessions were scheduled (20.2 vs 9.7 sessions). Yet, because group-practice registration was decentralized, patients spent 15% less time in completing scheduled visits (93.2 vs 109.9 minutes). Regular utilizers of the group practices made 7% more scheduled clinic visits on average (3.27 vs 3.05 visits), but 39% fewer walk-in visits (0.14 vs 0.23 visits). Hospital-wide, continuity of care was not affected. We conclude that adoption of a group-practice model at our institution improved clinic productivity, enhanced patient flow, and decreased unscheduled clinic visits.\r"

Five of these six patients experienced marked psychological stress. Each of these five patients underwent arrhythmia evaluation, demonstrating recurrent rapid monomorphic ventricular tachycardia related to changes in tone of the sympathetic nervous system. Subsequently, solitary beta-adrenergic blocker therapy was given to each patient. During therapy, four of the five patients had a marked reduction of both arrhythmia and symptoms during a follow-up ranging from 29 to 49 (mean, 38) months.\r"

The highest proportions of hospitalization or death were found for reports describing cardiovascular, hematologic, or respiratory effects. Nearly half of the reported deaths were in patients more than 59 years of age. The majority of reports described an adverse drug reaction occurring within two weeks of initial exposure to the suspected drug. Adverse drug reaction reporting by physicians is crucial to ensuring that pharmaceutical products are used appropriately.\r"

To determine the economic consequences of chlamydial infections in the United States, we analyzed data from local, state, and national sources. We estimate that C trachomatis infections cost Americans over $1.4 billion per year in direct and indirect costs. Chlamydial infections in women account for 79% of this cost, although men and infants are also affected. Three fourths of the total cost is due to sequelae of untreated, uncomplicated infections. If the current rate of chlamydial infection persists, the projected annual costs will exceed $2.18 billion by 1990. Reducing the incidence of personal suffering and heavy economic burden imposed by C trachomatis infections requires establishment and maintenance of effective prevention/control programs.\r"

After age 50 years there is no increased overall mortality with either high or low serum cholesterol levels. There is a direct association between falling cholesterol levels over the first 14 years and mortality over the following 18 years (11% overall and 14% CVD death rate increase per 1 mg/dL per year drop in cholesterol levels). Under age 50 years these data suggest that having a very low cholesterol level improves longevity. After age 50 years the association of mortality with cholesterol values is confounded by people whose cholesterol levels are falling--perhaps due to diseases predisposing to death.\r"

To define more clearly its proper role in preoperative assessment, we prospectively evaluated 111 patients undergoing vascular surgery. In the first set of 61 patients, our data confirmed the value of preoperative dipyridamole-thallium scanning in identifying the patients who suffered postoperative ischemic events. Events occurred in eight of 18 patients with reversible defects on preoperative imaging, compared with no events in 43 patients with no thallium redistribution (confidence interval for the risk difference: 0.624, 0.256). The results also suggested that clinical factors might allow identification of a low-risk subset of patients. To test the hypothesis that patients with no evidence of congestive heart failure, angina, prior myocardial infarction, or diabetes do not require further preoperative testing, we evaluated an additional 50 patients having vascular procedures. None of the 23 without the clinical markers had untoward outcomes, while ten of 27 patients with one or more of these clinical markers suffered postoperative ischemic events (confidence interval for the risk difference: 0.592, 0.148). In the clinical high-risk subset, further risk stratification is achieved with dipyridamole-thallium scanning.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the relationship between renal plasma flow (ERPF) or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the levels of norepinephrine (NE) or epinephrine (E) in plasma or urine in the presence of progressive degrees of non-oliguric renal functional impairment, these variables were assessed simultaneously in 18 normal subjects, 72 with parenchymal kidney disease and 14 with essential hypertension. ERPF and GFR were lower (P less than 0.01 to 0.001) in the groups with renal disease (mean +/- SD, 340 +/- 230 and 68 +/- 43 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively) or essential hypertension (434 +/- 101 and 97 +/- 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) than normal subjects (597 +/- 133 and 118 +/- 14 ml/min/1.73 m2). Plasma and urinary NE and E did not differ significantly among groups and were unrelated with ERPF or GFR (range 4 to 160 ml/min/1.73 m2), except for reduced (P less than 0.001) urinary NE and E excretion in the presence of a GFR less than 20 ml/min. Subgroups with renal disease and a normal (N = 39) or high blood pressure (N = 33) also were comparable in their plasma and urinary NE and E, while ERPF and GFR tended to be lower in hypertensive patients. It is concluded that a chronic reduction in excretory kidney function may have no relevant impact on circulating levels of NE and E per se, although their urinary excretion falls distinctly at the stage of advanced renal failure. These aspects deserve consideration when pathogenetic or diagnostic studies of catecholamines are performed in normotensive or hypertensive patients with impaired kidney function.\r"

Analysis of ligand binding by these PMN and monocytes showed no difference in the binding of casein, fMLPL, or aggregated IgG throughout the 45 minute procedure. In contrast, a progressive decrease in the binding of C5a by PMN and monocytes occurred. By 45 minutes, the average percentage of PMN binding C5a had dropped from 95 to 61% and monocytes from 73 to 40%. In additional studies, blood samples were obtained from chronic renal failure patients undergoing hemodialysis at four different time intervals during dialysis. Total white blood cell (WBC) counts showed that the mean WBC count at 30 minutes dropped to 60.9% of the predialysis WBC count, and rebounded to 133.8% by two hours and 128.2% by four hours. Analysis of the binding of C5a, casein, fMLPL, or aggregated IgG by PMN or monocytes from HD patients indicated there were no significant differences at the four time intervals studied. When blood samples from normal subjects or chronic hemodialysis patients were incubated in vitro with dialysis membrane fibers, a loss of identifiable C5a receptors was observed on PMN from normal blood, while PMN from HD patients showed no significant change in the percentage of C5a-receptor-positive cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Once thought of as a simple paraneoplastic syndrome mediated by the effects of tumor production of PTH, it is now clear that multiple mechanisms are involved and that these mechanisms involve abnormalities in calcium transport in bone, kidney, and gut. Calcium homeostasis in normal individuals is complex and tightly regulated. Although much has been learned over the last 20 years about the effects of individual hormones on target organs, much remains to be understood about how these hormonal systems interact to control extracellular fluid calcium. Future studies on disturbances in calcium homeostasis, such as that occurring in association with malignant disease, should do much to clarify how these complex hormonal mechanisms function in the normal individual.\r"

Medium aluminum concentrations were 20 to 500 ng/ml covering the range corresponding to concentrations reported in the plasma of aluminum-intoxicated hemodialyzed patients. Aluminum inhibited iPTH-release and caused severe cell alterations. This inhibition was incomplete and there was an aluminum-insensitive iPTH-release capacity. This phenomenon seemed to be due to heterogeneous parathyroid cell population as regards aluminum sensitivity, perhaps linked to the spontaneous asynchronous cyclic parathyroid cell changes. Sensitivity to aluminum was modulated by the extra-cellular calcium concentration. Sensitivity to extra-cellular calcium concentration variations persisted in aluminum intoxicated tissues. The severity of the observed cell lesions induced by high concentrations of aluminum suggested that the recovery of an iPTH-release capacity when parathyroid tissue was withdrawn from a toxic environment and switched to aluminum-free media is more likely to be due to activation of a \"less-sensitive to aluminum\" cell pool than to a true reversibility of the toxic effect.\r"

Sheep were injected monthly with isolated human GBM and antibody reactivities with isolated human and sheep GBM proteins were quantified with ELISA. Expectedly, the sheep had high titers of antibodies against several human GBM antigens. These antibodies remained for the most part in the circulation. In contrast, circulating antibody levels against sheep GBM antigens remained low for a long period of time, but a significant and progressive increase coincided with the development of acute nephritis. These antibodies accumulated in the kidneys of the nephritic sheep and could be eluted from diseased kidneys. They represent auto-antibodies immunologically cross-reacting with antigens of both sheep and human GBM. The specificity of auto-antibodies eluted from the kidneys was analyzed by immunoblotting and ELISA. The major populations reacted with one subunit, termed M2, of the globular domain of collagen IV. The same subunit contains the major antigen in Goodpasture's syndrome. It is concluded that the M2 subunit of the globular domain of collagen IV is recognized by IgG antibodies that primarily bind to the glomerular basement membrane in both Steblay's nephritis and Goodpasture's syndrome, indicating that it is a main nephritogen in both diseases.\r"

In the present study, the effect of chronic Ver administration on renal function, renal histology and mortality after subtotal nephrectomy was examined. Fourteen days after staged subtotal nephrectomy rats were paired according to renal functional impairment, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and body weight. Rats were pair fed and received either Ver (0.1 micrograms/g sc bid, N = 10) or saline (0.1 ml sc bid, N = 10) for up to 23 weeks. Both members of each pair were sacrificed shortly before the uremic death of controls. At sacrifice, rats treated with Ver had a lower serum creatinine (2.29 vs. 2.99 mg/dl, P less than 0.05) and a higher creatinine clearance (318 vs. 164 microliters/min, P less than 0.05) than controls. In a second experiment, survival was superior in rats treated with Ver than in controls from week seven (P less than 0.0025 by week 14). Serum creatinine was higher at week 10 in control rats (1.68 vs. 1.10 mg/dl, P less than 0.05). MAP was no different between the two groups, irrespective of the time between Ver administration and the measurement of MAP. Histological damage and nephrocalcinosis were worse, and renal and myocardial calcium content was higher in controls. In conclusion, independent of any effect on systematic MAP, chronic administration of Ver protects against renal dysfunction, histological damage, nephrocalcinosis and myocardial calcification, and improves survival in the remnant model of chronic renal disease.\r"

Fenestrated capillaries in other organs have anionic sites in the endothelial cell glycocalyx and at the luminal surface of the fenestral diaphragms. The purpose of this study was to map anionic sites at the luminal surface of peritubular capillaries and to assess whether a concentration gradient for albumin exists across the endothelium. Partial chemical characterization of these anionic sites was done by in vivo enzymatic degradation. The difference in distribution of albumin following enzyme digestion was also studied. The binding of cationized ferritin to the luminal surface indicated that the rat peritubular capillaries have anionic sites along the entire luminal surface of the endothelial cell, including the fenestral diaphragms. Partial biochemical characterization of these sites shows that the sites in the glycocalyx are mainly from neuraminic acid, while the fenestral diaphragms have mainly heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Intravascular albumin extended to the endothelial luminal plasmalemma and to the luminal surface of fenestral diaphragms. Digestion with heparitinase was associated with the leakage of albumin outside the capillary wall. These findings suggest that the anionic surface of fenestrae constitutes a charge barrier of the peritubular capillaries.\r"

  ".W": "There exists a strong interaction between aminoglycosides and phosphoinositides, and these membrane lipids are even considered as the drug receptors. To shed some light on the role of such an interaction in the drug nephrotoxicity, we have investigated the influence of aminoglycosides on phosphoinositide metabolism in kidney proximal tubules where these compounds accumulate. Experiments were carried out by measuring 32P labelling of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-P) and of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-P2) after incubation of homogenates of isolated proximal tubules with [gamma-32P] ATP. The treatment of rabbits with neomycin, gentamicin and amikacin (50, 50 and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively for seven days) promoted a decrease in 32P-PI-P2 and an increase in 32P-PI-P, when compared to the respective values observed in tubules from untreated rabbits. Under these conditions, the extent of modifications in lipid labelling was similar with the three drugs tested. In in vitro experiments, the exogenous addition of the above aminoglycosides to the incubation medium containing tubule homogenates from untreated rabbits also produced, in a dose dependent manner, a decrease in 32P-PI-P2 and an increase in 32P-PI-P. In the in vitro experiments, however, amikacin and gentamicin appeared to be less potent than neomycin. The results indicated moreover that phosphoinositide metabolism was more sensitive to the in vivo (vs. in vitro) action of the drugs. Phosphoinositides are involved in Ca2+ transport and/or mobilization processes, and aminoglycosides are known to interfere with the Ca2+ binding to membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed on rats subjected to renal ischemia and various treatment procedures to determine the origin and functional consequences of vascular obstruction. To this end, its occurrence and severity was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively in the outer medulla, where it is particularly prominent. The incidence of medullary hyperemia was not influenced by inhibiting thrombocyte aggregation with 5 or 70 mg/kg of acetyl salicylic acid or preventing fibrin deposition with 100 IE/kg of heparin before ischemia, and these substances produced no improvement renal function. The incidence and degree of hyperemia, however, could be substantially reduced or completely eliminated by acutely raising blood pressure after ischemia or by decreasing the number of circulating erythrocytes before ischemia. These procedures were effective in raising filtration rate and tubular reabsorption from 20% to 60% of normal, in restoring renal blood flow and vascular resistance to completely normal, and in diminishing epithelial damage both three and 18 hours after ischemia. The following conclusions are drawn: first, vascular obstruction, which is not lessened by inhibiting thrombus formation but is easily reversed or prevented by raising perfusion pressure or decreasing hematocrit, is probably caused by erythrocyte aggregation during ischemia. Second, vascular obstruction, which appears to raise renal vascular resistance and lower blood flow and filtration rate, cannot be limited to the medulla but must also be present in the cortex. Finally, reversing or preventing vascular obstruction can fully restore renal perfusion, partially restore glomerular and tubular function, greatly reduce tubular necrosis and thus prevent renal failure.\r"

We have employed a panel of hematopoietic colony-forming assays to evaluate the specificity of the inhibitory activity. Spermine and its precursor spermidine when added to culture inhibited mouse and human erythroid (CFU-E and BFU-E), granulocyte-macrophage, and megakaryocyte colony growth in a non-specific, dose-dependent fashion. Erythroid and non-erythroid colony growth were equally sensitive to spermine- and spermidine-induced inhibition. Increasing concentrations in culture of erythropoietin and mitogen-stimulated leukocyte-conditioned medium, a source of colony-stimulating activity, failed to overcome the in vitro inhibition. Although anemia is characteristic of chronic renal failure (CRF), leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are not. Therefore, we conclude that the non-specific inhibitory activity of spermine and spermidine, as defined by in vitro colony assays, is either of no pathophysiologic significance in the anemia of CRF, or else there are unrecognized repair mechanisms in vivo which maintain granulopoiesis and thrombopoiesis at normal levels.\r"

Renal calcium content correlated significantly with serum creatinine (r = +0.23, P less than 0.001, N = 246); serum phosphate P less than 0.001, N = 169) but not with serum calcium (r = -0.10, P greater than 0.1, N = 193). Fivefold greater calcium content was measured in biopsied patients with normal renal function than in normal postmortem renal tissue (35.7 +/- 5.2 vs. 7.6 +/- 0.7 mgCa/100 g wet renal tissue, P less than 0.001). Those biopsied patients with significant functional impairment (SCr greater than 1.5 mg/dl) had a higher mean level of serum phosphorus and serum [Ca] X [P] product than patients with normal renal function (5.19 +/- 0.22 vs. 3.92 +/- 0.11 mg P/dl and 44.8 +/- 1.8 vs. 35.7 +/- 1.2 mg2/dl2, respectively), and slightly higher renal calcium content (85.3 +/- 32.2 vs. 35.7 +/- 5.2 Ca/100 g wet renal tissue, P = 0.06), which correlated with histologic calcium deposition (r = +0.52, P less than 0.02, N = 20). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that renal calcium deposition begins early in the course of a variety of renal diseases and hence may play a secondary pathogenetic role that accelerates progression to chronic renal failure. Severity of renal calcium deposition is equally closely related to hyperphosphatemia and to the level of renal impairment.\r"

Factor analysis revealed the differential characteristics of subjects defined as difficult to locate, difficult to interview or missing. Subjects who are difficult to locate, or who in the extreme case will go missing, tended to have poorer social functioning prior to intake and to be residentially unstable during the follow-up period, characteristics that tend to correlate with worse drinking outcome. Subjects who are unwilling to be interviewed tended to be residentially stable and show better interpersonal adjustment at follow-up. Less intensive location procedures would have resulted in data loss from those classified as difficult to locate. Less persuasive interview techniques would have resulted in data loss from those classified as difficult to interview. Early termination of the follow-up would also have resulted in data loss from the latter group. The distinct types of data biases that would be introduced by loss of information from each of the above subgroups are examined.\r"

  ".W": "A series of alcohol abuse prevention strategies was evaluated using computer simulation for three counties in the United States: Wake County, North Carolina, Washington County, Vermont and Alameda County, California. A system dynamics model composed of a network of interacting variables was developed for the pattern of alcoholic beverage consumption in a community. The relationship of community drinking patterns to various stimulus factors was specified in the model based on available empirical research. Stimulus factors included disposable income, alcoholic beverage prices, advertising exposure, minimum drinking age and changes in cultural norms. After a generic model was developed and validated on the national level, a computer-based system dynamics model was developed for each county, and a series of experiments was conducted to project the potential impact of specific prevention strategies. The project concluded that prevention efforts can both lower current levels of alcohol abuse and reduce projected increases in alcohol-related problems. Without such efforts, already high levels of alcohol-related family disruptions in the three counties could be expected to rise an additional 6% and drinking-related work problems 1-5%, over the next 10 years after controlling for population growth. Of the strategies tested, indexing the price of alcoholic beverages to the consumer price index in conjunction with the implementation of a community educational program with well-defined target audiences has the best potential for significant problem reduction in all three counties.\r"

Alcoholics with a positive family history were found to have: an earlier onset of alcoholism, greater alcoholic severity, more medical and legal problems, a broader range of treatments, an increased lifetime prevalence of additional psychiatric disorders and a greater diversity of psychiatric disturbance among biological relatives. The degree of psychiatric heterogeneity in the patients roughly corresponded to the degree of psychiatric heterogeneity in their families. Assortative mating was proposed as a possible mechanism to account for clinical differences between the familial and nonfamilial alcoholic.\r"

Drinking-driving is reported by 6.1% of U.S. adults, is almost three times more prevalent among men than women and is most prevalent in 18-24-year-old men (15.4%). Sociodemographic characteristics of self-reported drinking drivers correspond with those characteristics based on alcohol-associated motor vehicle accident and arrest data. Heavy smokers and those who fail to use seatbelts are more likely to drink and drive than those without these health-risk behaviors. Men reporting stress in interpersonal relationships are more likely to drink and drive. Individuals who drink or smoke in response to stress are more likely to drink and drive than those who exercise in response to stress. The concurrent practice of drinking-driving with lack of seatbelt use, use of alcohol in response to stress and smoking probably contributes substantially to the risk of accident and serious injury among drinking drivers and has implications for both prevention and treatment programs.\r"

More women than men support the idea that to recover alcoholics will have to quit drinking forever. The contrary is true of the idea of controlled drinking. Education and income are negatively associated with items on loss of control and controlled drinking. Respondents who have had their lives deeply affected by an alcoholic and those who report a drinking problem of their own do not differ in their opinions about alcoholism from those who do not have these characteristics. Alcoholics Anonymous is the most common form of treatment recommended by the respondents. In general, results show considerable support for treatment as well as ambivalence regarding the disease concept.\r"

Suspiciousness about the experiment was evaluated through an open-ended questionnaire, responses to which were independently content-analyzed by two scorers. Major findings were as follows: Women exposed to nine wine commercials consumed more wine than those exposed to three. Twelve women were judged suspicious about the experiment, but none showed continued specific awareness of the study's true purpose. The differential consumption patterns of women in the three-wine-commercial and nine-wine-commercial conditions were exaggerated among suspicious women. These findings, in light of previous observations, suggest opposite reactions to soft-sell versus hard-sell persuasive appeals by men and women, notably ones predisposed to be suspicious about the purpose of experiments.\r"

The relationship between adolescent self-drinking and peer alcohol use was found to be reciprocal, complex and limited to close friends. Baseline AAIS predicted follow-up close friend drinking level, but baseline QF Index did not. Baseline close friend drinking level predicted follow-up QF Index but not follow-up AAIS. Normative structure toward alcohol was found to be stable over time and unrelated to baseline self or peer alcohol use. Baseline perceived harm due to alcohol use predicted follow-up QF Index, indicating that adolescents adjust behavior to prior attitudes.\r"

Two decades after their first admission, 70 male alcoholics with a good social adjustment were chosen for personal examination and of these 60 (86%) were interviewed. Social drinking was twice as common as abstinence among the former alcohol-dependent subjects. Abstainers had a higher frequency of initial ratings indicating lack of internal control of behavior and were less often socially stable when first admitted as compared with the social drinkers. Early improvement was related to initial abstinence; the subjects who improved later in life more often reported a gradual change from alcohol abuse to social drinking.\r"

In this paper, four patients with typical mycosis fungoides and granulomas demonstrated histologically in their cutaneous infiltrates are presented. All four died of disseminated disease with evidence of central nervous system involvement in three of them. These clinical histories lend no support to the notion that granulomatous mycosis fungoides is a benign variant of this lymphoma. Relevant literature is reviewed and discussed.\r"

When the metastases to the lungs are multiple, it is indicative of extensive tumor burden, and the organ plays an insignificant role in the distribution of the metastases in the different lobes of the lungs. However, when the pulmonary metastases appear after a prolonged disease-free interval it becomes an enigma; when the metastases are solitary, the majority (over 80% in this series) are located in the upper zone of the lungs. This study of 28 patients with solitary lung metastases explores the possible etiology of this clinical observation and proposes that the pattern of perfusion and anatomopathological features of the upper lobes are the main reasons why these lobes are prevalently the sites for solitary lung metastases.\r"

A total of 27 atrial myxomas, seven benign nonmyxomatous tumors, and eight malignant tumors were resected. The mean age was 47 years (range 8 to 79) in 27 female and 15 male patients. The clinical presentations included congestive heart failure in 24 patients, palpitations in nine, neurologic symptoms in six, recurrent cardiac tamponade in three, vasculitis in two, and chest pain in two. Thirty-one of 34 benign lesions were completely resected, although one patient required cardiac transplantation to resect completely an \"inoperable\" benign tumor. All gross tumor was resected in four of eight patients with malignant lesions. All patients survived operation, but three with malignant disease died within 30 days. Late outcome was known for 41 of 42 (98%) patients. Total follow-up for the series was 200.1 patient-years, for an average of 4.7 years (range 1 month to 18 years). Excellent early and late results were obtained in patients with benign lesions, as there was no known tumor recurrence even if resection was incomplete. Effective palliation and local control of disease is possible with extensive resection of malignant primary tumors, but more effective adjuvant therapy will be necessary to improve long-term prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Anomalous systemic or pulmonary venous connections can coexist with certain forms of complex cyanotic heart diseases that are reparable only by atriopulmonary anastomotic procedures, thus complicating the intraatrial separation of systemic and pulmonary venous pathways. Anomalous systemic or pulmonary venous connections were encountered isolated or in combination in 17 patients (10%) among a series of 170 modified Fontan-Kreutzer procedures. Fourteen of these 17 patients (82.3%) survived their operations, which utilized different techniques to deal with the various forms of anomalous systemic and pulmonary venous connections. There was one late death (5.8%). Extracardiac exclusion of a left superior vena cava with an end-to-side left cavopulmonary shunt proved to be a more successful alternative than the use of complicated intratrial baffles. Because of the complexity of the anatomic variables, repair of anomalous systemic or pulmonary venous connections in conjunction with a modified Fontan-Kreutzer procedure requires a detailed preoperative anatomical and physiologic diagnosis, and an individualized plan for each patient must be formulated to provide unobstructed venous pathways.\r"

  ".U": "87171373\r", 
  ".W": "Since February 1982, we have used a modified technique to repair tetralogy of Fallot with transatrial closure of the ventricular septal defect, a short infundibular incision with avoidance of muscle resection, and anterior expansion of the right ventricular outflow tract using a patch in every case. The pulmonary anulus is approached in the usual manner. Twenty-six patients have had repair with this technique without mortality, and 20 patients (Group 1) have been evaluated 1 to 3 years postoperatively. Their results are compared with those of all patients followed up in our division who had had repair by the traditional technique in the 5 years before February 1982, with the same evaluation within 4 years of operation (Group 2, n = 22). Ten of 20 patients in Group 1 and 14 of 22 in Group 2 required a transannular patch. At cardiac catheterization, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction was effectively relieved in both groups (right ventricular systolic pressure [mean +/- standard error], Group 1 versus Group 2, 45 +/- 5 versus 49 +/- 4 mm Hg). No patient with the modified technique had a residual ventricular septal defect. By M-mode echocardiography, right ventricular-left ventricular end-diastolic dimension ratio was significantly lower for Group 1 patients (0.58 +/- 0.03 versus 0.78 +/- 0.04; normal less than 0.45; p less than 0.001). With radionuclide ventriculography, right ventricular ejection fractions were significantly higher for Group 1 patients with the modified repair (38% +/- 2.2% versus 33% +/- 1.8%; normal greater than or equal to 45%; p less than 0.05). Because the incidence of obligatory pulmonary insufficiency caused by transannular patch is similar in both groups, these results cannot be directly attributed to the presence of pulmonary insufficiency alone. With ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, no patient in Group 1 had any ventricular premature contractions whatsoever, whereas six of 22 patients in Group 2 had demonstrable ventricular premature contractions. These results suggest that in children with tetralogy of Fallot, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction can be effectively relieved with this modified approach with improved early preservation of right ventricular function.\r"

The great arteries were normally related in Case 1 and were transposed in Case 2. Repair involved the following procedure: ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus, restoration of aortic continuity with an 8 mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft, placement of an internal patch to tunnel all left ventricular blood from the left ventricle through the ventricular septal defect into the pulmonary artery in Case 1 and patch closure of the ventricular septal defect in Case 2, transection of the main pulmonary artery, anastomosis between the proximal pulmonary artery and the ascending aorta, and interposition of a valved conduit between the right ventricle and the distal pulmonary artery. The operative field could be approached easily through a median sternotomy. Postoperative cardiac catheterization revealed satisfactory anatomical and hemodynamic results in both cases.\r"

  ".W": "Ten infants with critical aortic stenosis underwent transventricular valvotomy between November 1983 and September 1984. The ages of the patients ranged from 1 to 38 days (mean 21.2 days). Three patients were less than 1 week of age. One had undergone a previous valvotomy performed with inflow occlusion. Most infants were critically ill when admitted to the hospital, six required inotropic and ventilatory support, and two had peritoneal dialysis before the operation. Transventricular valvotomy was performed through a left thoracotomy with Hegar dilators. Postvalvotomy peak-to-peak gradients ranged from 0 to 35 mm Hg. Three patients died at 2, 3, and 6 weeks after operation. A severe degree of endocardial fibroelastosis was present in one patient, and a second patient died of septicemia caused by wound infection, empyema, and a bronchopleural fistula. Severe left ventricular hypertrophy, with moderate fibroelastosis, was found at autopsy in the third patient. Aortic incompetence was not detected postoperatively. One patient required reoperation 7 months after the transventricular valvotomy. Transventricular valvotomy has proved to be a simple and effective technique to relieve aortic stenosis in sick infants. It permits the correction of associated coarctation of the aorta and avoids a median sternotomy. Results are comparable with the results obtained with either cardiopulmonary bypass or inflow occlusion as seen in both our experience and in the experience of others.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty children less than 18 years of age underwent cardiac valve replacement with a prosthetic valve between 1967 and 1984 and have been followed up for a mean of 6 years (range 1 to 17 years). Their mean age at the time of operation was 13 years (range 6 to 17 years). All patients were begun on a regimen of warfarin before hospital discharge. One major and four minor bleeding episodes occurred in 211 patient-years of warfarin therapy, an incidence of 2.3 per 100 patient-years. Three of those five episodes occurred in patients who were receiving excessively anticoagulation or who were participating in physical activities inappropriate for a patient on warfarin therapy. Thus, the majority of the bleeding episodes were preventable. There were five thromboembolic events in 211 patient-years, an incidence of 2.3 per 100 patient-years. Three of those five patients had intentionally stopped their warfarin therapy. The majority of thromboembolic episodes, like the bleeding episodes, were preventable. Eight teenage patients were noncompliant with the warfarin therapy. More than one third of that group experienced a thromboembolic event, an incidence of 5.5 per 100 patient-years (55 patient-years). Twenty-two patients adhered to the warfarin regimen and only two (9%) of them had a thromboembolic event, an incidence of 1.3 per 100 patient-years (156 patient-years). Warfarin therapy presented no greater risk of serious bleeding to this pediatric age group than it does to an adult age group. The incidence of thromboembolism among these patients was less than that which is generally reported for adult patients. Discontinuation of or noncompliance with warfarin therapy substantially increased the risk of thromboembolism. Continuous warfarin therapy is recommended for every child after prosthetic valve replacement.\r"

One child with pulmonary hypertension required a Bjork-Shiley pulmonary valve; in the others no valve was inserted. This technique simplifies conduit replacement, allows for a generous-sized outflow tract that may grow with patient growth, and uses material unlikely to become obstructed.\r"

In this study, we endorse the suggestion that the lesion be considered a spectrum of anomalies, unified by a juxtapulmonary ventricular septal defect with malalignment of the infundibular septum. The ends of the spectrum are hearts with, on the one hand, double-outlet right ventricle and, on the other hand, a discordant ventriculoarterial connection. We studied 10 hearts within this spectrum, eight with a double outlet and two with discordant ventriculoarterial connection. We found that the same basic morphology could exist with a bilaterally complete infundibulum or in the presence of fibrous continuity between the mitral and the pulmonary valves. Features of most significance for surgical correction were the arrangement of the outlet septum (particularly the presence or absence of chordal attachments from the atrioventricular valves), the morphology of the coronary arteries, and the state of the subaortic infundibulum. The options for surgical correction are determined by the internal morphology of the lesions rather than by the precise ventriculoarterial connection.\r"

We have tried to analyze whether the available data gave information about the nature and the mechanisms adapting the remaining lung to the larger than normal pleural space and about the persistence of this adaptation in the longer term. There were 32 patients with a persistent, disturbed forced expiration (mean 50% of vital capacity). This group of patients was excluded from the study to answer the above questions, because the subdivisions of the total lung capacity in this group differed significantly from those in the group of 98 patients with a normal forced expiratory volume of 72% (mean) of vital capacity. The data of the 98 patients, who were subdivided into seven age groups at the time of pneumonectomy, permitted the following conclusions: In the youngest age group (0 to 5 years), the ventilatory capacity is hardly smaller than the predicted capacity for two lungs; this suggests that compensatory growth by way of hyperplasia might have been the most important adaptive mechanism in this group. In the age group 6 to 20 years, a significant difference is still found as compared to the group of patients operated on at an older age; this difference indicates that in this period compensatory growth, possibly mainly simple hypertrophy, still played an important but gradually decreasing role. The fact that the effect of the adaptational mechanisms could be observed more than 30 years after ablation of one lung, without loss in quality of function (i.e., forced expiratory volume constituting a normal percentage of the vital capacity), indicates that the adaptive mechanisms also compensate for the loss in lung tissue in the longer term. A striking finding was the stability of the tidal volume/functional residual capacity ratio, which, especially in the younger age groups, was very close to the predicted value for two lungs. This finding is in agreement with the fact that most persons with a healthy remaining lung lead a normal family and social life after pneumonectomy.\r"

None of the patients rated the result as unsatisfactory. A computed tomogram of the chest wall was performed to study the depression (b/c), asymmetry (b'/b), and flatness (a/b) of the chest wall, where a was the maximum transverse distance of the chest wall, b and b' were the maximum distance from the anterior to the posterior chest wall at the left and right sides (b greater than b'), and c was the perpendicular distance from the point of the anterior chest wall at its greatest deformity to the level of the anterior tip of the spine. In patients with a good result, b/c and b'/b were well corrected, while in patients with a fair postoperative result, they were still significantly different from those in subjects with normal chest walls. Moreover, 85.7% of the patients (6/7) with b/c over 3.0 before operation had a fair postoperative result. The degree of a/b was not corrected in patients with either good or fair postoperative results. We conclude that an operative approach to lengthen ribs would be necessary to improve the degree of a/b, that in patients with severely depressed funnel chest, expressed as a b/c value over 3.0 by computed tomography, a transient support with struts should be applied, and finally, that a more careful approach for correction of asymmetry should be undertaken to improve the operative results.\r"

The pathologic conditions disclosed during the operation were correctly visualized with two-dimensional epicardial echocardiography, done before cardiopulmonary bypass. Cineangiography provided this information in one patient, and precordial two-dimensional echocardiographic analysis was correct in two patients. Thus, intraoperative two-dimensional echocardiography provides detailed information in complicated native and prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis that is of importance in the surgical management.\r"

In Group I, left ventriculography gave 23.2 +/- 1.8 mm (mean +/- standard deviation), whereas the aortography method showed 22.4 +/- 2.7 mm (p less than 0.05). Those values of 20 mm or less were regarded as imperfect measurements; inaccurate results were more frequent in the aortography method (16 cases; 28%) than in the left ventriculography method (only two cases; 3.5%), with significant difference (p less than 0.025%). In Group II, there was no significant difference in respective values determined by the two different methods; 18.7 +/- 3.0 mm, with a range from 13 to 23 mm in the left ventriculography method, and 19.9 +/- 3.1 mm, with a range from 14 to 24 mm, in the aortography method (p greater than 0.2). Imperfect measurement by the aortography method tended to occur when the cusp base was severely deformed. The results indicated that left ventriculography was more reliable than root aortography for estimating the size of the aortic anulus.\r"

Where available, early institution of a left ventricular assist device is an alternative with possible advantages. In a canine model of left ventricular failure caused by 45 minutes of normothermic ischemic arrest, these two methods of support were instituted after an initial 30-minute reperfusion period. Both methods provided adequate support of the circulation (cardiac output greater than 2 L/min and mean arterial pressure greater than 50 mm Hg). After only 3 hours, however, significant differences were seen between the two groups. When the hearts were examined histologically, dogs in the group with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and inotrope infusion had significantly more necrosis than those in the group with a left ventricular assist device, 7.7% +/- 5.0% (mean +/- standard deviation) versus 2.0% +/- 1.3%. Decreases in compliance and systolic function were significantly greater in the group with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and inotrope infusion when compared with those supported with a left ventricular assist device. These findings suggest that even when support with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and inotrope infusion resulted in satisfactory hemodynamics, early institution of a left ventricular assist device was significantly more effective in preserving myocardial structure and function.\r"

Of these patients, 43 had baseline somatosensory evoked potentials from stimulation of the upper and lower extremities, intraoperative monitoring for at least 3 hours, and absence of an intrinsic lesion of the spinal cord. Major reductions in amplitude of the ulnar and tibial cortical evoked potentials occurred shortly after induction of anesthesia in 12% of patients. Latencies gradually increased during the operation as the concentration of volatile anesthetic agents increased. In patients with preoperative evidence of cervical cord damage, the cortical responses showed more fluctuations and could be lost without major changes in the concentration of the anesthetic agent or surgical manipulation. In one patient, intraoperative monitoring of the cervical cord function prevented a postoperative neurologic deficit. Ulnar and tibial cortical evoked potentials were successfully monitored throughout operation in all patients in whom baseline scalp responses could be obtained, but careful monitoring of anesthetic effect is necessary for proper interpretation.\r"

Iatrogenic antral gastritis, induced by 7 days of treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, was not associated with the presence of C. pyloridis. Organisms were found in 6 of 24 patients who had undergone gastric operations, but the prevalence of C. pyloridis was not higher in those with symptoms of alkaline reflux gastritis than in asymptomatic postgastrectomy control patients.

Effects on bone mineralization are of particular concern in pediatric patients with growth potential. We measured plasma aluminum levels in 36 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and 22 on hemodialysis under surveillance at a single pediatric center. The levels were above normal in 35 and 21 patients, respectively, and the values correlated with the oral dose of aluminum-containing phosphate-binding medications (r = 0.57; P less than 0.001). Younger and smaller children had higher plasma aluminum levels and also received larger doses of oral aluminum-containing compounds. Mean plasma aluminum levels (57.2 +/- 52.8 and 48.7 +/- 32.1 micrograms/liter, respectively) and the daily oral doses of elemental aluminum (47.3 +/- 37.6 and 39.2 +/- 26.7 mg/kg, respectively) were not statistically different in patients on CAPD and those on hemodialysis. Plasma aluminum levels did not correlate with estimated cumulative oral intake of aluminum, total duration of dialysis, serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations, N-terminal parathyroid hormone levels, or transfusion requirements. Retention of aluminum is common in children undergoing dialysis, correlates with the amount of aluminum administered orally, and results in similar elevations of plasma aluminum with CAPD and hemodialysis. Younger and smaller children are at increased risk for accumulation of aluminum. Alternative methods for control of serum phosphorus are needed in children with end-stage renal disease.\r"

The technique of Hedley was used for preparation of paraffin-embedded tissue into single dissociated nuclei, and the method of Vindelov was used for staining with propidium iodide. Among the 53 leiomyomas, the DNA ploidy pattern was diploid in most tumors (87%), except for 2 DNA tetraploid/polyploid and 5 DNA aneuploid samples. In comparison, the 20 benign leiomyoblastomas had more frequent abnormal DNA histograms: DNA tetraploidy/polyploidy in 5 (25%) and DNA aneuploidy in 2 (10%). The DNA histograms of the 44 leiomyosarcomas (including 4 epithelioid leiomyosarcomas) were classified as follows: 20 cases (45%) exhibited a DNA diploid pattern, 14 cases (32%) had a DNA tetraploid/polyploid pattern, and 10 cases (23%) had DNA aneuploid peaks. For the patients with leiomyosarcomas, the DNA ploidy pattern was significantly correlated with survival (P less than 0.001), as were tumor grade (P less than 0.001) and tumor size (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, both benign and malignant gastric smooth muscle tumors with DNA tetraploid/polyploid patterns were significantly larger than those with a DNA diploid histogram (P less than 0.05). DNA ploidy pattern cannot be used for diagnosis--that is, to distinguish malignant from benign gastric smooth muscle tumors. For gastric leiomyosarcomas, however, nuclear DNA ploidy pattern is an easily measured objective determination with important prognostic significance.\r"

For patients older than 60 years of age, a score of 29 or less resulted in a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 88%.

Four months after the procedure, her exercise tolerance had increased and she no longer had exertional dyspnea. Among the few reported cases of balloon valvotomy in adult patients with pulmonary stenosis, the systolic pressure gradient and the peak systolic ventricular pressure have been considerably reduced. Possible mechanisms by which transluminal balloon valvotomy relieves obstruction are tearing or deformation of the valve cusps, separation of fused commissures, fracture of valvular calcification, dilation of the annulus, or some combination of these factors. Balloon valvotomy seems to be an appropriate therapeutic choice for pulmonic stenosis in adult patients.\r"

Because of the current emphasis on reducing health care costs, many insurers are requiring the procedure of tonsilloadenoidectomy be performed on an outpatient basis, even though there is a lack of data supporting the safety of such a requirement. The charts of 2,944 pediatric patients who underwent tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy from January 1, 1983 to December 31, 1984 were reviewed. Analyses revealed predictive variables that could be used to identify patients with a low risk of complications. Nineteen percent of the patients could be released 4 hours postoperatively with an 8.1% chance of subsequent complications. No patients who underwent the combined procedure of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy were in this group. Of the remaining patients, 0.4% could be released 6 hours after surgery, or 85.9% could be released 8 hours after surgery, or 98.2% could be released 10 hours after surgery, all with a less than 10% chance of subsequent complications. This study supports keeping tonsilloadenoidectomy patients at least 8 hours and possible 10 hours after surgery to minimize the risk of complications after discharge.\r"

Electrophysiologic testing of the spinal accessory nerve and of the ventral rami of the cervical spinal nerves was performed in cats and humans. These studies indicated that motor potentials recorded in the trapezius muscle after stimulation of the ventral rami of cervical spinal nerves in general represented the spread of current to the contiguous portions of the spinal accessory nerve or directly to the trapezius muscle. Rarely did there seem to be evidence of motor innervation to the upper and lower trapezius by fibers conveyed by the ventral rami of cervical spinal nerves. The predominant motor input to the trapezius muscle is through the spinal accessory nerve. Subjective evaluation, objective strength testing, and electromyographic evaluation were performed on patients who had undergone neck dissections. Three types of neck dissection were employed. These were modified neck dissection with preservation of the spinal accessory nerve, radical neck dissection with sacrifice of the spinal accessory nerve, and reconstruction using a cable graft and classical radical neck dissection. Regarding all of the methods of evaluation and comparison, the patients who retained function of the spinal accessory nerve in the postoperative period fared better than those who had a classical radical neck dissection with sacrifice of the spinal accessory nerve. This again supports the concept that the most important and predominant motor supply to the trapezius muscle is through the spinal accessory nerve. All of this information was used to construct a model of the spinal portion of the accessory nerve and of the innervation of the trapezius muscle. The clinical implications of this model are stated.\r"

Also, the number of poor injection-esophageal speakers was much higher than in the group of nonmyotomized laryngectomees. A \"normal\" pseudoglottis could only rarely be identified by fluoroscopy in the myotomized group. A significantly lower intratracheal pressure appeared to be required for tracheo-esophageal phonation after myotomy.

Manofluorography is a technique which allows simultaneous analysis of both manometry and videofluoroscopy of deglutition on a single video screen. Using manofluorography, the physician can see the cause of the manometric pressure waves. Understanding of the PE segment pathophysiology has been limited. Dysfunction is usually labeled as cricopharyngeal achalasia or incoordination, which may lead to cricopharyngeal myotomy. However, this approach has yielded poor results. This study demonstrates that laryngeal elevation and timing of the swallowing reflex also play an important role in controlling pressures and function in the PE segment during deglutition. These factors must also be examined in assessment of cricopharyngeal dysfunction to guide appropriate management.\r"

Mean age of onset of ALS is 57 years, and there is a sex predilection for men in a ratio of 1.5:1. Area of first symptom is in the lower extremity is 36 per cent of cases, in the upper extremity in 32 per cent, and 25 per cent of patients have a bulbar onset. Motor cranial nerves in the lower brain stem from cranial nerve nuclei or corticobulbar tract degeneration are affected. This results in symptoms of speech and swallowing difficulty and emotional lability in up to 60 per cent of cases. One hundred per cent of cases have motor weakness, over 90 per cent have muscle atrophy and fasciculations, and 47 per cent have spasticity. There seems to be a pattern of progression of ALS signs and symptoms based on area of onset with LLE involvement tending to follow RLE weakness, LUE weakness following RUE onset, and RUE involvement following next in patients whose onset is bulbar. Significant numbers of ALS patients had sparing of involvement of parts of the body for follow-up times approaching 3 years. Although the majority of patients experience a deterioration that is significantly linear, seven of 28 patients or 25 per cent achieved a plateau lasting a minimum of 9 months. Survival in our series was 4.08 years for all forms of MND.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An education-support group for family members of patients with ALS has been functioning at New England Medical Center in Boston and has been found to be successful in helping families and, therefore, patients to cope with this stressful illness. This article discusses the benefits of this group to families and patients, family members' roles in caring for and coping with this illness, the group's structure and development, and gives suggestions to others who are considering running a group of this kind. Our experience has shown that group participants feel less isolated, less fearful, and less threatened than prior to their involvement in the group and gain a sense of empowerment that enables them to meet the extensive caretaking demands of the patient with ALS. The contribution that an ALS Family Support Group provides is a component in the care of the patient with ALS that can be critical to families dealing with this illness.\r"

Bath application of potassium channel blockers, such as tetraethylammonium and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which are almost without effect on the monophasic compound action potential of normal nerves, considerably enhanced the action potential duration in nerves from mutant mice. Furthermore, external current recordings from motor endings revealed an absence of the K-dependent waveform component in MED mice, which indicates a similar K current intensity in the terminal part of the endings and in the heminode. These observations suggest that in the mutant, unlike in normal mice, K channels play a role in action potential electrogenesis. Possible relationships with paranodal dysmyelination are discussed.\r"

The coefficient of variation of the plasma creatine kinase activities was found to be large (approximately 35%) in both patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and normal control subjects. A comparison of the plasma activities of creatine kinase with other muscle-derived enzymes suggests that the cause of this variability is changes in the release of enzymes from muscle. Data obtained concerning the effect of physical activity on plasma creatine kinase activity are contradictory, but several young patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and a very high creatine kinase activity (greater than 5000 IU/liter) showed a decreased activity following admission to hospital. An estimate of the rate of efflux of certain kinase from muscle has been made, indicating that young ambulant patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have a grossly elevated muscle creatine kinase efflux (495.0 +/- 61.3 IU/kg muscle/hr) compared to control subjects (1.4 +/- 0.5 IU/kg muscle/hr).\r"

Rats were killed 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 42 days after tenotomy of the soleus, and the muscles were removed and assayed for calcium-activated protease activity. Maximal protease activity occurred 1 week after tenotomy, at the time when myofibril organization is completely disrupted. Activity was still high 2 and 3 weeks after the operation, but returned to normal levels by 6 weeks, when muscle histology had returned to normal. The time course of the calcium-activated protease activity corresponded closely to the time course of the morphological changes. Thus, calcium-activated neutral protease may play a major role in myofibrillar proteolysis following tenotomy and in making the myofibril susceptible to proteolytic attack by other, less specific proteases.\r"

Eight college-age subjects performed 40 maximal isometric contractions of the knee extensor muscles (10-second contraction/20-second rest). Serum samples and soreness ratings were taken prior to and 2, 6, 18, and 24 hours after the exercise. The CK MM1 and CK MM3 isoforms were determined by flatbed isoelectric focusing (IEF). In serum, the MM1 isoform (the pure gene product) is considered to be evidence of newly released CK from muscle, as upon entering the plasma, the CK MM1 is converted to MM2 and then MM3. A significant increase in serum CK activity was found at 6 hours and remained elevated at 24 hours. CK MM1 increased significantly at 2 hours, peaked at 6 hours, then approached baseline. Soreness did not increase significantly until 18 hours. Analysis of CK isoforms in serum can provide an earlier indicator of skeletal muscle damage than total CK or perception of soreness and may be useful in tracking the time course of skeletal muscle damage and repair.\r"

The predicted normal density (D) at any age may be derived from the formula D = (1 X 10(3]/(0.0699 + 0.00725 square root t). The distribution of myelinated fiber diameters is unimodal in the first 4 months of life, and there is a definite bimodal distribution by 2 years of age. Total transverse fascicular area of sural nerve increases progressively from values of about 0.25 mm2 in the first week to about 0.82 mm2 at 9 years. Control values for sural nerve morphometry in childhood are essential for accurate interpretation of biopsies in patients with peripheral neuropathy.\r"

As no therapeutic effects were observed, longitudinal data obtained are taken to indicate changes in disease progress. Variance in voluntary contractions was found to be similar to that with electrically stimulated contractions; thus, variation could not be attributed to motivational changes, but rather to physiologic changes. Dystrophic muscle was slower to relax and less fatiguable than normal. However, such changes are of less significance to the overall disability compared to the loss of muscle bulk (cross-sectional area). Important variations in the function of individual muscles essential to complex performance, such as walking or getting up from the floor, could be masked by combining results from several muscle groups.\r"

There were four occurrences of isolated denervation of the pronator teres muscle; four occurrences of anterior interosseous nerve lesions; three occurrences of lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve lesions; two occurrences of long thoracic nerve lesions; and one occurrence each of a median nerve trunk lesion, a median palmar cutaneous branch lesion, a suprascapular nerve lesion, and an axillary nerve lesion. \"Neuralgic\" pain was a prominent feature in all cases, and the location of the pain correlated with the location of the nerve lesions. We hypothesize that the specific course of certain nerves (especially their location across joints) selectively exposes them to mild focal trauma that increases their susceptibility to this disease. Whatever the etiology, this entity is considerably more diverse than generally appreciated.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of the peripheral neuropathy induced by vincristine is poorly understood, but interference of vinca alkaloids with microtubule assembly suggests that microtubule changes could be important. This possibility was studied by directly exposing the rat sciatic nerve to graded concentrations of vincristine sulfate. Microtubule length histograms prepared from randomly selected axons showed a unimodal distribution in vincristine and control axons. In vincristine-exposed axons, however, there was a shift to shorter length microtubules, and the mean measured length of microtubules (0.42 +/- 0.37 micron) was significantly (P less than 0.001) shorter than controls (0.67 +/- 0.55 micron). On cross-sections, the vincristine-exposed axons showed a decrease in the number of microtubules per square micrometer of axonal area compared to controls. These findings fit best with a loss of portion(s) of each microtubule and support the possibility that microtubules changes were associated with malorientation of microtubules and neurofilaments, accompanied by free vesicle accumulation and fragmentation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. These structural alterations would account for the previously observed abnormalities in axoplasmic transport and would also provide insight into the commonly observed peripheral neuropathy induced by vincristine treatment.\r"

With aging, the balance between axonal sprouting and withdrawal appears to shift in favor of denervation. Here we have examined the extent and direction of the remodeling process during the adult life of the rat (5-111 weeks) by quantification and morphometry of NMJ structure as seen in electron microscopic composites and in cholinesterase (ChE) stained whole mounts. We have found that the net effect of axonal sprouting and withdrawal on the entire NMJ region varies with age: at 5-12 weeks there is rapid growth and maturation; at 12-48 weeks slower growth occurs, and at 48-82 weeks there is a gradual shift in direction to result in progressive loss of synaptic contact in individual NMJs; finally, at 82-111 weeks, there is loss of entire NMJs with some continued reinnervation at others. The diaphragm NMJ also exhibits continuous structural remodeling; however, between 82-111 weeks many changes in the ChE staining pattern appear abruptly.\r"

Maximum elevation occurred at 12 and 24 hours for both CNEMG (mean, 178% of baseline) and MNEMG (mean, 134% of baseline). CK returned to baseline by 48 to 72 hours. In 25-30% of subjects CK elevation significantly exceeded the normal range. The magnitude of CK elevation is greater and the time course more prolonged than previously reported. CK measurements should be avoided 4 to 48 hours following CNEMG because of the potential for false positive results. Measurements immediately after and at 72 hours are not affected by the CNEMG or MNEMG. The time course for CK change following MNEMG is similar to CNEMG, but the magnitude is less.\r"

A previously developed volume conductor model for the CAP is applied to analyze the recorded CAPs in close relation with the morphological findings in the biopsy. First, the fiber diameter histograms obtained from the biopsy are used to simulate CAPs, by assuming a linear relation between fiber diameter and propagation velocity. It is concluded that the simulated CAPs deviate systematically from the recorded CAPs. Next, the assumption of a linear diameter-velocity relation is left, and the assumed fiber velocity distribution is adapted to obtain optimal model reconstructions of the recorded CAPs. It is concluded that the model is capable of reconstructing the recorded CAPs, including slow components and small polyphasic potentials in the case of severe fiber loss. It is demonstrated how the diameter histogram and the optimal velocity distribution can be combined to an empirical estimate of the diameter-velocity relation.\r"

To clarify the processes leading to demyelination we injected rat sciatic nerves with serum from GBS and control subjects in the presence of complement and examined the sequential morphologic changes over 7 days. One day after injection, five of six GBS sera but none of seven control sera caused vesicular demyelination; 3-5 days after injection both GBS and control sera produced macrophage-mediated demyelination. These observations suggest that GBS serum can initiate acute myelin injury through a humoral mechanism that is disease associated. This response appears to be distinct from delayed cell-mediated serum-induced demyelination that is not disease specific.\r"

As genetic markers for the disorder, we used DNA-sequence polymorphisms detected with 12 different DNA probes derived from the vicinity of the Duchenne's muscular dystrophy locus or from within the gene, on the X chromosome. One male fetus of a proved carrier mother was predicted to be unaffected, and this was confirmed after birth. Another male fetus was predicted to be unaffected (probability, 95 percent or greater), although a crossover event had been identified in a region of the X chromosome thought to be distal to the Duchenne gene. Unfortunately, an elevated serum creatine kinase level after birth indicated that the infant had inherited the Duchenne mutation. Three male fetuses predicted to be affected with 66 percent or 95 percent probabilities were aborted, and the presence of the DNA-marker alleles was confirmed in fetal tissues. In one family, in which the maternal grandparents were unavailable, the initial genetic interpretation had to be revised after a second male fetus was analyzed with intragenic probes. Our experience suggests that despite the large number of intragenic and flanking DNA polymorphisms available, uncertainties often remain in the prenatal diagnosis of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. Pitfalls are presented by the large size of the region in which Duchenne's mutations can occur. Crossover events in this region, which result in an exchange of DNA between two X chromosomes, can render DNA-marker studies inaccurate. Also, an autosomal recessive mutation can produce the same clinical picture.\r"

  ".W": "We report an outbreak of thyrotoxicosis without true hyperthyroidism that occurred between April 1984 and August 1985 among residents of southwestern Minnesota and adjacent areas of South Dakota and Iowa. One hundred twenty-one cases were identified through surveillance of medical clinics, laboratories, hospitals, and physicians' offices. Investigation of the outbreak demonstrated an association between the occurrence of thyrotoxicosis and the consumption of ground beef prepared from neck trimmings processed by a single slaughtering plant (odds ratio, 19.0; P = 0.0001). The cause was confirmed by the findings of bovine thyroid tissue in samples of these trimmings and high concentrations of thyroid hormone in implicated samples of ground beef and the demonstration of prompt increases in serum thyroid hormone concentrations in volunteers who ate the implicated ground beef. Bovine thyroid tissue had been introduced into the neck trimmings inadvertently during the process of \"gullet trimming,\" a procedure that harvests muscles from the bovine larynx. The outbreak resolved after this procedure was discontinued at the plant. The clinical features of the illness suggested the diagnosis of silent thyroiditis, and it is possible that sporadic cases--or even outbreaks--of thyrotoxicosis factitia caused by this mechanism may have occurred in the past but were not recognized.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective cohort study of 249 children from birth to two years of age, we assessed the relation between prenatal and postnatal lead exposure and early cognitive development. On the basis of lead levels in umbilical-cord blood, children were assigned to one of three prenatal-exposure groups: low (less than 3 micrograms per deciliter), medium (6 to 7 micrograms per deciliter), or high (greater than or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter). Development was assessed semiannually, beginning at the age of six months, with use of the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (mean +/- SD, 100 +/- 16). Capillary-blood samples obtained at the same times provided measures of postnatal lead exposure. Regression methods for longitudinal data were used to evaluate the association between infants' lead levels and their development scores after adjustment for potential confounders. At all ages, infants in the high-prenatal-exposure group scored lower than infants in the other two groups. The estimated difference between the overall performance of the low-exposure and high-exposure groups was 4.8 points (95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 7.3). Between the medium- and high-exposure groups, the estimated difference was 3.8 points (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 6.3). Scores were not related to infants' postnatal blood lead levels. It appears that the fetus may be adversely affected at blood lead concentrations well below 25 micrograms per deciliter, the level currently defined by the Centers for Disease Control as the highest acceptable level for young children.\r"

  ".W": "To assess quantitatively the association between benzene exposure and leukemia, we examined the mortality rate of a cohort with occupational exposure to benzene. Cumulative exposure for each cohort member was estimated from historical air-sampling data and, when no sampling data existed, from interpolation on the basis of existing data. The overall standardized mortality ratio (a measure of relative risk multiplied by 100) for leukemia was 337 (95 percent confidence interval, 154 to 641), and that for multiple myeloma was 409 (95 percent confidence interval, 110 to 1047). With stratification according to levels of cumulative exposure, the standardized mortality ratios for leukemia increased from 109 to 322, 1186, and 6637 with increases in cumulative benzene exposure from less than 40 parts per million-years (ppm-years), to 40 to 199, 200 to 399, and 400 or more, respectively. A cumulative benzene exposure of 400 ppm-years is equivalent to a mean annual exposure of 10 ppm over a 40-year working lifetime; 10 ppm is the currently enforceable standard in the United States for occupational exposure to benzene. To examine the shape of the exposure-response relation, we performed a conditional logistic-regression analysis, in which 10 controls were matched to each cohort member with leukemia. From this model, it can be calculated that protection from benzene-induced leukemia would increase exponentially with any reduction in the permissible exposure limit.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1982 and December 1986, among the 750 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who were treated at two adjacent hospitals in New York City, 78 (10.4 percent) needed evaluation for renal disorders. Reversible acute renal failure due to nephrotoxic injury, ischemic injury, or both was present in 23 patients (30 percent) (Group I). The remaining 55 (70 percent) had massive proteinuria, azotemia, or both (AIDS-associated nephropathy; Group II), and irreversible uremia developed in 43. In an additional 18 patients, all of whom had a history of intravenous narcotic drug use, AIDS was diagnosed after the initiation of maintenance hemodialysis for chronic renal failure (Group III). Survival for more than six months after the onset of chronic uremia occurred in only two subjects in Group II; all patients in Group III died within three months of the diagnosis of AIDS. Death in the patients in Groups II and III followed a syndrome of \"failure to thrive\" characterized by inanition unresponsive to intensive nutritional support and hemodialysis. In contrast, 8 of 17 patients with acute renal failure (Group I) and a serum creatinine concentration above 6 mg per deciliter regained renal function (serum creatinine level, less than 2.0 mg per deciliter). Four of the seven lived for 10 to 24 months, whereas the other four died of sepsis within a month. Our observations suggest that maintenance hemodialysis is not effective in prolonging life either in patients with AIDS-associated nephropathy and uremia or in patients with end-stage renal failure in whom AIDS develops during the course of maintenance dialysis. Hemodialysis may be useful in the management of potentially reversible acute renal failure in patients with AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "It has been known since the last century that the bill of the platypus contains densely packed arrays of specialized receptor organs and their afferent nerves. Until recently these were thought to be largely mechanoreceptive in function. However Scheich et al. provide both behavioural and electrophysiological evidence that there are electroreceptors in the bill of the platypus. These authors were able to record evoked potentials from the somatosensory cortex of the brain in response to weak voltage pulses applied across the bill. Behavioural observations showed that a platypus could detect weak electric dipoles and it was suggested the animal was able to locate moving prey by the electrical activity associated with muscle contractions. From these observations, and in view of the fact that it was known that the bill contained gland receptors which in several respects resembled the ampullary electroreceptors in fresh-water fish, Scheich et al. concluded that the receptor array of the platypus bill included electroreceptors. In this report we present direct electrophysiological evidence for the existence of such receptors.\r"

  ".U": "87172986\r", 
  ".W": "The presence of both parental genomes is essential for development to term in the mouse embryo probably because of germline-specific modifications of homologous chromosomes. Neither androgenetic nor parthenogenetic embryos can by themselves develop to term; any post-implantation embryos they produce have opposite phenotypes, which reflects the presence of complementary information in parental chromosomes. The development of androgenetic----parthenogenetic chimaeras is of considerable interest because in this case both parental chromosomes are available even though they are in separate cells. We demonstrate here that in post-implantation chimaeric fetuses, the expression of parental information results in spatial specificity so that parthenogenetic cells are confined to the embryo but the trophoblast consists almost entirely of androgenetic cells. The yolk sac contains both cell types. However, there is incomplete functional complementation because the chimaeras do not reach term. Although failure to reach term may occur partly because of inadequate intermingling and interactions between embryonic cells, it is more likely that further control of mouse development depends on the presence of both sets of chromosomes within the same cells.\r"

How do these sex-determining systems evolve? Direct evidence is virtually non-existent because the sex-determining systems of most species appear to have little genetic variation. Here we provide the first evidence of adaptive variation in environmental and genetic sex determination within a species. We show that in a fish with temperature-dependent sex determination, populations at different latitudes compensate for differences in thermal environment and seasonality by adjusting the response of sex ratio to temperature, and by altering the level of environmental as opposed to genetic control. The adjustments observed are precisely those predicted by adaptive sex ratio theory.\r"

One of the two subunits of membrane-associated brain spectrin, alpha-fodrin is an actin-binding protein which is found at the periphery of chromaffin cells and may be involved in secretion. Because cultured chromaffin cells can be permeabilized with detergents, giving pores large enough to permit the entry of immunoglobulin molecules, we used permeabilized cells to test the effect of specific antibodies on secretory mechanisms. Incubation of permeabilized cells with polyclonal immunoaffinity-purified monospecific anti-alpha-fodrin antibody or its Fab fragments did not modify basal release but did specifically inhibit Ca2+-induced catecholamine release by exocytosis. Our observations indicate that fodrin and the cytoskeleton participate in the release mechanism.\r"

Expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos is induced in response to a variety of growth factors and differentiation-specific agents. The viral cognate of the c-fos gene is the resident transforming gene of FBJ-murine osteosarcoma virus which causes bone tumours in vivo and cellular transformation in vitro.

In this study, a detailed mutational analysis of the adenovirus E1B promoter was undertaken to define the DNA sequences required for proper basal transcription and E1A transactivation. Two key findings emerged: first the E1B promoter is an unusually simple RNA polymerase II promoter requiring only two sequence elements for proper regulation, the TATA box and a binding site for transcription factor Sp1; and second only mutations in the TATA box interfere with E1A-transactivation, suggesting that E1A mediates its effect on this promoter through the TATA-box transcription factor.\r"

A nuclear protein called cyclin of relative molecular mass 36,000 (Mr 36K), whose synthesis correlates with the proliferative state of the cell, has been identified in several cell types of human, mouse, hamster and avian origin. The rate of cyclin synthesis is very low in quiescent cells and increases several fold after serum stimulation shortly before DNA synthesis. Immunofluorescence and autoradiography studies have shown that the nuclear staining patterns of cyclin during S phase have a sequential order of appearance and a clear correlation can be found between DNA synthesis and cyclin positive nuclei. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin have many common properties and it has been shown that these two are identical. Recently a protein which is required by DNA polymerase-delta for its catalytic activity with templates having low primer/template ratios has been isolated from calf thymus. We report here that cyclin and the auxiliary protein of DNA polymerase-delta are identical.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of replication of the simian virus 40 (SV40) genome closely resembles that of cellular chromosomes, thereby providing an excellent model system for examining the enzymatic requirements for DNA replication. Only one viral gene product, the large tumour antigen (large-T antigen), is required for viral replication, so the majority of replication enzymes must be cellular. Indeed, a number of enzymatic activities associated with replication and the S phase of the cell cycle are induced upon SV40 infection. Cell-free extracts derived from human cells, when supplemented with immunopurified SV40 large-T antigen support efficient replication of plasmids that contain the SV40 origin of DNA replication. Using this system, a cellular protein of relative molecular mass 36,000 (Mr = 36K) that is required for the elongation stage of SV40 DNA replication in vitro has been purified and identified as a known cell-cycle regulated protein, alternatively called the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) or cyclin. It was noticed that, in its physical characteristics, PCNA closely resembles a protein that regulates the activity of calf thymus DNA polymerase-delta. Here we show that PCNA and the polymerase-delta auxiliary protein have similar electrophoretic behaviour and are both recognized by anti-PCNA human autoantibodies. More importantly, both proteins are functionally equivalent; they stimulate SV40 DNA replication in vitro and increase the processivity of calf thymus DNA polymerase-delta. These results implicate a novel animal cell DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase-delta, in the elongation stage of replicative DNA synthesis in vitro.\r"

  ".U": "87173020\r", 
  ".W": "Lignin is a complex polymer of phenylpropanoid subunits. It is an essential component of woody tissue, to which it imparts structural rigidity. Lignin is remarkably resistant to degradation by most microbes; nevertheless, a few species of white-rot fungi are able to catalyse its oxidation to CO2. Its biodegradation is of great ecological significance because, next to cellulose, lignin is the most abundant renewable polymer on Earth. The first step in lignin degradation is depolymerization, catalysed by the lignin peroxidase isozymes (ligninases). These isozymes are secreted, along with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burds, under conditions of nutrient (nitrogen) limitation. Ligninases are not only important in lignin biodegradation, but are also potentially valuable in chemical waste disposal because of their ability to degrade environmental pollutants. We have undertaken the cloning of the ligninase genes to understand further their regulation and enzymology. We report here the isolation and characterization of a ligninase complementary DNA clone with a full-length insert. The cDNA sequence shows that the sequence of the mature ligninase is preceded by a 28-residue leader, and the mature protein is predicted to have a relative molecular mass of 37,000 (Mr 37K). Consistent with the classification of ligninase as a peroxidase certain residues thought to be essential for peroxidase activity can be identified and near these residues the ligninase shows homology with other known peroxidases. Our cDNA clone has also allowed us to show that expression of ligninase is regulated at the messenger RNA level.\r"

  ".W": "The first movements of the fetus are apparently random and spontaneous. Their onset coincides with the growth of dorsal root afferents into the spinal cord and it is possible that they are not simply a result of spontaneous motoneuron activity but are reflex responses to sensory stimulation. It is not clear what stimuli could normally evoke such reflexes because nothing is known of the properties of primary afferent neurons in the fetus. I have investigated this by making recordings from single dorsal root ganglion cells in fetal rats in vivo. The afferents have small, defined receptive fields and respond to mechanical stimulation of skin or muscle at intensities that might occur in utero. Many of them are also chemosensitive. Unlike postnatal afferents they display background activity which peaks at the same age as fetal movements. Repeated stimulation causes long-lasting increases of both background and evoked activity. Such sensory input is likely to have a considerable influence on fetal movements and on the development of spinal cord connections.\r"

At the autonomic neuroeffector junction it has not been possible to carry out similar studies. Here we report a method of extracellular recording which allows simultaneous measurement of both the nerve action potential and transmitter release from postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals. We have confirmed that release is intermittent, but the importance of this new approach is that the relationship between the nerve terminal action potential and transmitter release can be studied unambiguously for the first time. Thus we are able to show unequivocally that intermittence is caused by a low probability of release in the invaded varicosity and not by failure of the action potential to invade the varicosity.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple cell surface proteins of relative molecular mass 115,000-155,000 (Mr 115K-155K) have been implicated as receptors mediating adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. But the organization and relatedness of these peptides has remained unclear. In separate studies, the 'very late antigens' VLA-1 (Mr 210K/130K) and VLA-2 (Mr 160K/130K) were initially characterized as surface heterodimers appearing 2-4 weeks after in vitro stimulation of human T cells. Three more VLA heterodimers have since been discovered, which, like VLA-1 and VLA-2, are each composed of unique alpha-subunits in association with a common 130K beta subunit. This paper shows that the common VLA beta-subunit is equivalent to subunits found in structures with known fibronectin and laminin receptor activity, and that VLA-3 and VLA-5 are similar or identical to these previously defined receptors for adhesion molecules. Antibody blocking studies confirmed that at least some of the widely distributed VLA proteins of previously unknown function are involved in cell adhesion to fibronectin and laminin. We suggest that the VLA family of receptors may provide cells with multiple independent substrate adhesion capabilities.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolic basis of the autosomal recessive disease cystic fibrosis (CF) remains unidentified. Elevated levels of a serum protein in CF homozygotes and obligate heterozygotes have been described. As heterozygotes are clinically unaffected, any consistently observed abnormality in these individuals is a likely pointer to the aetiology of the disease. The gene for this serum protein, called cystic fibrosis (CF) antigen, has been mapped to chromosome 1. It is not the gene that is mutant in CF because this has since been assigned to chromosome 7 by cosegregation of the disease with closely linked DNA markers in CF families. CF antigen is a product of normal and leukaemic granulocytes and is inducible in the promyelocytic cell line HL60 (M.N., J.D., C. Hayward, F. Northrop, D.J.H.B., J. Walker, V. van H. and D.S.S., manuscript in preparation). We have isolated cDNA clones for this protein from a library constructed with messenger RNA from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cells. The complete nucleotide sequence was obtained from the cDNA clone and by primer extension of mRNA. We have confirmed that the gene encoding CF antigen is on chromosome 1 and have localized it to a particular region. RNA blot analysis shows a 550-bp major transcript in CML cells and in induced HL60. The amino-acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence shows significant homology with intestinal and brain calcium-binding proteins. Abnormal accumulation of such a protein in CF is a clue which must be pursued now that evidence is gathering that the basic defect in CF is in pathways controlling chloride channel activity.\r"

Although the major capsid protein VP1 is involved in endocytosis, and largely defines virion structure, the functions of the minor proteins VP2 and VP3 have remained obscure. Here we show that VP2 from both polyoma virus and simian virus 40 (SV40) is covalently linked to myristic acid; this is the first report of a myristylated protein in the nucleus and of a fatty acid being important in the structure of a nonenveloped virus. We consider the implications of this unusual modification on encapsidation and suggest that VP2 may be a scaffolding protein for virion assembly.\r"

The lenses of other vertebrate classes often contain other major proteins, notably delta-crystallin in birds and reptiles. A fourth distinct type, described as epsilon-crystallin, is prominent in many bird and crocodile lenses. Here we show that epsilon-crystallin is an active glycolytic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (EC 1.1.1.27) and that duck epsilon-crystallin appears to be identical to duck LDH-B4. LDH is a normal metabolic component in other lenses, but in duck is present in amounts far exceeding the requirements of any likely catalytic role. It appears that an active enzyme has been recruited, unchanged, to an extra role as a structural protein in the lens without gene duplication and sequence divergence. This surprising discovery raises the possibility that other crystallins may similarly be enzymes expressed at high levels in lens as structural proteins.\r"

Given the positions of N cities, which in the simplest case lie in the plane, what is the shortest closed tour in which each city can be visited once? We describe how a parallel analogue algorithm, derived from a formal model for the establishment of topographically ordered projections in the brain, can be applied to the travelling salesman problem. Using an iterative procedure, a circular closed path is gradually elongated non-uniformly until it eventually passes sufficiently near to all the cities to define a tour. This produces shorter tour lengths than another recent parallel analogue algorithm, scales well with the size of the problem, and is naturally extendable to a large class of optimization problems involving topographic mappings between geometrical structures.\r"

Including anatomical evidence of the dentition and facial skull, it provides an unambiguous link between a Neogene fossil and the owl monkey, Aotus, the only modern crepuscular-nocturnal anthropoid primate. This new form brings to three the number of La Venta fossil monkeys which preserve excellent dentitions sharing extensive similarities with modern genera. All of these species are potentially ancestral to their extant relatives. The La Ventan Aotus is additional support for the idea that the modern platyrrhine radiation includes long-lived genera or generic lineages, some of which may be traceable to the early Miocene, 20 Myr BP.\r"

For example, the pattern of right-eye, left-eye dominance columns is permanently altered by simply closing an eye of a young primate. A critical issue is whether environmental factors also influence the development of other cortical sensory areas. In the present experiments we manipulated the tactile experience of young rats by depriving them of the sensory information that is normally provided by their large facial whiskers. Electrophysiological analyses showed that simply trimming the whiskers from the day of birth results in pronounced abnormalities in the response properties of single neurons in the adult somatic sensory cortex. Thus functional plasticity in response to early experience appears to be a fundamental aspect of cortical development.\r"

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the first enzyme in the pathway of catecholamine synthesis. Its importance is reflected in the diversity of the mechanisms that have been described which control its activity; TH levels vary both during development and as a function of the activity of the nervous system. Recently, we deduced the complete amino-acid sequence of rat TH from a complementary DNA clone encoding a functional enzyme. Here we demonstrate that, in man, TH molecules are encoded by at least three distinct messenger RNAs. The expression of these mRNAs varies in different parts of the nervous system. The sequence differences observed are confined to the 5' termini of the messengers and involve alternative splicing events. This variation has clear functional consequences for each putative form of the enzyme and could represent a novel means of regulating catecholamine levels in normal and pathological neurons.\r"

  ".W": "A new subfamily of the alpha-globin-like family has recently been identified in higher primates, rabbit, galago and possibly the horse. One member of this subfamily, theta 1, is downstream from the adult alpha 1-globin gene. In orang-utan, but not in rabbit or galago, the theta 1-gene appears to be structurally intact, suggesting that it may be functional in this species. The orang-utan theta 1-gene possesses initiation and termination codons, and the predicted polypeptide differs from the orang-utan alpha 1-globin by 55 amino acids. The upstream promoter boxes CCAAT and ATA are present, although approximately 150 base pairs (bp) farther upstream than in the alpha 1-gene. This structural difference in the promoter between the orang-utan theta 1- and alpha 1-genes has led Proudfoot to speculate that the theta 1-gene may be inactive. We have now cloned the theta 1- and alpha 1-globin genes from the olive baboon, and have compared their sequences with those of orang-utan. The unique promoter structure of the orang-utan theta 1-gene is highly conserved in baboon, although the orang-utan and baboon diverged nearly 30 million years ago. The coding sequences of the two theta 1-genes differ by only 6.3% with 22 out of 27 nucleotide substitutions being codon third position silent changes. These data support the view that the theta 1-gene has been functional in the baboon, orang-utan, and by implication, in man. We also estimate that the duplication event generating the theta 1- and alpha-globin-like subfamilies may have occurred as much as 260 million years ago.\r"

The 10.5-base-pair (bp) periodicity of some dinucleotides first found in eukaryotic DNA sequences was interpreted as the expression of curvature of periodic segments of double-stranded DNA, the curvature resulting from co-orientation of periodically spaced 'wedges' between stacked base pairs. The wedge can be decomposed into roll and tilt components, opening towards a groove and a backbone respectively, both contributing to DNA curvature. The largest wedge was estimated to belong to the AA-TT dinucleotides. Recent work provided new experimental data on synthetic curved DNA. The authors tried to apply the wedge model to their results and met problems in doing so. We have found that taking into account both roll and tilt components of the AA-TT wedge, in the correct ratio, leads to remarkable consistency between the wedge model and the data.\r"

This study presents a systematic nomenclature based on the result of anatomical dissection in the cavernous sinus (CS) of 32 human subjects. The ophthalmic artery was found arising inside the CS in 5 subjects (15.6%). The posterior trunk (meningohypophyseal trunk of Parkinson) was present in all subjects (100%), but its distribution varied considerably. In 9 subjects, one or two of its primary divisions originated directly from the ICA. The lateral trunk was found in 21 subjects (65.8%), and the capsular arteries of McConnell of the median group were found in 9 (28.1%). Other branches to the surrounding structures (trigeminal ganglion and divisions, superior wall of the CS, the 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerves, and osseous branches) were inconstant. Anastomotic branches to the ophthalmic, middle meningeal, and ascending pharyngeal arteries were also noted. A systematic nomenclature is proposed, in which the branches of the ICA are named according to their topographical origins from the artery and their primary or secondary divisions are named according to their destinations.\r"

AERs were studied: (a) in the normal and then in the hydrocephalic animal; and (b) in the hydrocephalic animal during further ICP elevation by cerebrospinal fluid infusion. The AER was obtained from ongoing electroencephalographic activity after rarefaction auditory clicks presented at 90 dB sound pressure equivalent. In comparing base line normal AERs to those found in hydrocephalic conditions, a statistically significant increase in latency for AER components N2, P2, and P5 was noted in hydrocephalic rabbits. Increased ICP in the hydrocephalic model showed an increase in the latencies of AER components for P0 and P1 at 250 mm H2O, and a prolongation of P3-P5 central conduction time at 700 mm H2O above base line cerebrospinal fluid pressure. In addition, a decrease in the P4/N5 amplitude and an increase in P1-P3 central conduction times at 700 mm H2O was observed. The differences between normal and hydrocephalic rabbit AER base lines may be the result of the chronically increased ICP and presumed chronic anatomical changes within the auditory pathway due to kaolin itself. The differences in the AER from base line hydrocephalus to acute increased ICP may indicate that the hydrocephalic system is more sensitive to acute neuropraxic pressure effects on the brain stem auditory structures than is the normal brain.\r"

Incidental lesions were defined as parenchymal areas of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging, which could not be directly explained by the patient's current clinical diagnosis, neurological status, or computed tomographic (CT) scan. The ILs were noted and graded according to size, multiplicity, and location and were correlated with age, clinical presentation, CT scan findings, and risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. One or more IL were identified in 22% of patients under 40 years of age, in 57% of patients 41 to 60 years of age, and in 90% of patients over 60 years of age. Large patches of confluent ILs were not encountered in any patient less than 40 years of age; they were present in 10% of patients 41 to 60 years of age, and in 30% of patients over 60 years of age. The incidence of severity of ILs correlated significantly with age (P less than 0.0005) and with risk factors for cerebrovascular disease (P less than 0.02). Patients with most severe ILs also had areas of vague periventricular leukomalacia on the CT scan. The clinical significance of incidental MRI lesions in various age groups is discussed in detail.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was a single PCoA in every hemisphere. Eleven (22%) were of fetal origin, and 17 (34%) were hypoplastic. Infundibular dilatations were found in 5 (10%) of the arteries. The outer diameter (OD) of the PCoA at its origin was 1.5 +/- 0.8 mm on the right and 1.6 +/- 0.6 mm on the left. At the junction of the PCoA with the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery, the PCoA had an OD of 1.4 +/- 0.7 mm on the right side and 1.6 +/- 0.6 mm on the left. The total length of the PCoA was 12.7 +/- 3.2 mm on the right and 12.5 +/- 1.7 mm on the left side. PCoA branches originated from the superior (36%) or lateral (64%) surface of the PCoA and coursed superiorly, posteriorly, or laterally. These vessels supplied the paramedian perforated substance (21%), the tuber cinereum (16.8%), the sulcus between the optic tract and the tuber cinereum (14.4%), the circuminfundibular anastomosis (11.5%), the mamillary bodies (8.4%), the sulcus between the optic tract and the cerebral peduncles (7.6%), and the cerebral peduncles (5.7%). The largest and most constant branch of the PCoA was the premamillary artery. The number and size of the branches from the PCoA were independent of the size of the parent artery.\r"

  ".U": "87173492\r", 
  ".W": "In some cases, basilar artery aneurysms cannot be repaired surgically and the basilar artery is occluded near the neck of the aneurysm to stop flow into the aneurysm. After the operation, the aneurysm can fill only by flow through the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs). Hemodynamically if the flow were the same in both PCoAs and there were no phase lag in the pressures, there would be no pressure gradient for flow to go across the neck of the aneurysm and therefore the aneurysm would thrombose. We have assumed that the diameter of the artery is roughly proportional to the flow that goes through it chronically. We measured the diameters of the PCoAs in 25 patients who had hunterian ligation of the basilar artery. We also measured the maximal width, height, and depth of the aneurysms on angiograms obtained before and after operation. Eleven aneurysms thrombosed completely and had a diameter ratio of greater than 0.6; 10 aneurysms thrombosed partially and had a diameter ratio of 0.46 approximately 1.0; 4 aneurysms did not change and had a diameter ratio of less than 0.45. The ratio of the sizes of the PCoAs pre- and postoperatively was comparable in most cases, so we believe that it is possible to predict reasonably accurately from this simple measurement whether the aneurysm is likely to thrombose if the basilar artery is ligated.\r"

The effect of metabolic changes on neurological outcome and the importance of nutritional support on nutritional status and neurological outcome were also evaluated. Using a powerful statistical tool, convergence analysis, it was possible to take into consideration the effects of a number of confounding factors that obviously affected general metabolism. Most of the patients were hypermetabolic for prolonged periods. In addition, many did not receive even basal requirements of calories or protein for many days. Despite this, their outcomes were determined by their initial neurological status and the amounts that they were fed, admittedly relatively modest, did not influence their courses. Despite such feedings, their visceral protein levels, which often dropped initially, rose toward normal levels, indicating effective adaptation. Indeed, it could not be shown that these patients developed complications of malnutrition such as infections. However, it will require a sophisticated randomized clinical trial of vigorous intravenous hyperalimentation to determine whether this complex, dangerous, and expensive therapy is helpful for severely head-injured patients.\r"

The new frame unit is made of lightweight fiberglass and aluminum, weighing only 14 lb (6.5 kg), and utilizes the hydraulic elevator pump of the operating table as a means to raise or lower the frame. Thus, adjusting the horizontal plane of the lumbar spine requires no separate crank system. The anterior tibial cushions, lying in hemicylindrical troughs, and the ergonomically designed cushions for chest and buttocks improve the distribution of body weight. A new, fully adjustable, cushioned face rest is used to maintain the neck in a neutral position, with the patient placed fully face-down.\r"

Thirty-two patients had CNS complications, and 4 had an acute peripheral neuropathy. Disease was acute and monophasic in 33, but 3 patients had progressive disease, including 1 patient with a relapsing-remitting course. No clinical features, including CSF content of myelin basic protein, were prognostic indicators. In three of six patients with encephalomyelitis, lymphocytes showed a proliferative response to myelin.\r"

EMG showed severe diffuse denervation, but only mildly slowed nerve conduction velocities, in both legs. Meningitis persisted for 6 weeks and was exacerbated prior to the patient's death. Necropsy revealed subpial and subependymal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Histology of ventral roots demonstrated proximal CMV infection and massive fiber loss. In this immunosuppressed patient, CMV caused a severe motor polyradiculopathy by selective destruction of the motor neurons of ventral spinal roots and motor cranial nerves.\r"

  ".W": "Subacute encephalitis, characterized by demyelination, gliosis of the gray and white matter, focal necrosis, microglial nodules, atypical oligodendrocyte nuclei, and multinucleation of cells, was present in 27 of 30 (90%) autopsied patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex. Subacute encephalitis was mainly distributed in the frontal (58%) and temporal (69%) lobes, basal ganglia (77%), amygdala (80%), and hippocampus (64%). Ten (37%) with moderate or severe subacute encephalitis were demented; 82% with mild subacute encephalitis had no recognized neurologic disorder. Human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) was isolated from neural tissue or CSF in 11 of 13 patients, 10 with subacute encephalitis, and 1 without CNS lesions. We conclude that subacute encephalitis is common in AIDS patients and is most likely caused by CNS infection with HTLV-III.\r"

The clinical findings in the infarct syndrome were similar to idiopathic PSP. Five MI-PSP patients had had a stroke, four had focal dystonia, two had hemiparesis, and one had an intention tremor of recent onset. In contrast, only 5.9% (12.9% of those with CT or MRI) of 426 Parkinson's disease patients had evidence of strokes. One case of PSP studied pathologically was attributed to cerebral amyloid angiopathy.\r"

Amitriptyline was superior to placebo in relieving pain in weeks 3 through 6. Both steady, burning pain and lancinating pains were relieved. Patients able to tolerate higher amitriptyline doses reported greater relief, through the maximum dose of 150 mg nightly. Amitriptyline analgesia was similar in depressed and nondepressed subgroups and was not associated with mood improvement. We conclude that amitriptyline relieves pain in diabetic neuropathy; this effect is independent of mood elevation.\r"

The pharmacologic study showed a direct and mutual antagonism of physostigmine and anticholinergic agent on myoclonus, implying cholinergic hyperactivity in the pathophysiology of myoclonus.\r"
