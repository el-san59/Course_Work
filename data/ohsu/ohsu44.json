  ".W": "Over the past decade, the Department of Family Medicine at Jefferson Medical College has used a network of seven residency-based family practice centers each year to teach 223 third-year medical students in their required family medicine clerkship. A comparison of these affiliated residency programs with a control group of the other family medicine residency programs in Pennsylvania and Delaware (with minimal third-year teaching responsibilities) from 1976 to 1984 has shown that the affiliated programs had a significantly higher National Residency Matching Program (NRMP) fill rate (92% v. 77%), had a higher percentage of programs with fill rates above the national average (71% v. 41%), and filled their full complement of residents more often (82% v. 52%) than the control programs. This success in residency recruitment was due in part to the fact that the affiliated programs filled one-third of their positions with Jefferson graduates, three times the percentage found in the control programs. For family medicine residency programs, teaching third-year medical students in a required clerkship offers a major opportunity to improve their residency selection results in the NRMP.\r"

During the baseline study period, use of these procedures was documented for only about 40% of patients. A physician education program (conferences reviewing appropriate health maintenance screening procedures, and information on the use of a specific health screening flow sheet) did not significantly change the rate of documented physician performance of these procedures. After a health screening flow sheet was introduced into the medical record, the rate of documented performance of these screening tests increased. However, despite the presence of the screening flow sheet in the patient record, most screening evaluations were documented only in the progress notes. These results suggest that the screening flow sheet serves primarily as a memory prompting device. The usefulness of the flow sheet as a patient data storage device appears questionable.\r"

  ".W": "Many patients have questions or concerns about sex, but few talk directly about the subject with their physician. Including a sexual history during the physician-patient encounter is one way to indicate to the patient that discussing sexual concerns is appropriate. We observed that physicians at the University of Iowa Family Practice Center were divided into two groups: those who routinely include a sexual history with a new patient and those who do not. Those physicians who claimed to routinely take a sexual history reported 33.3% of their patients had some type of sexual question, concern, or problem; those who claimed they do not include such a history reported only 9.5% had a sexual concern (P less than 0.05). Female physicians were less apt to take a sexual history than male physicians (11.8% v. 60%; P less than 0.001). We conclude that education in sexual history taking is an important part of the family practice curriculum for resident training.\r"

It was further hypothesized that patient compliance would be higher in the experimental group. Experimental group health beliefs changed in a significant, positive direction with respect to illness susceptibility and severity, the benefits of treatment, and patient modifying factors. Control group attitudes did not significantly change. Compliance rates for both groups were very high; 91.8% compliance was noted for experimental subjects and 85.6% for controls. This may reflect the additional time and attention given all those participating in the study.\r"

Control subjects were other family practice patients, matching the experimental group in age, sex, and race. The number of medical visits to the family practice clinic, specialty clinics, and the emergency room were the dependent measures. The study period was two years. Results indicated that the experimental subjects were more likely than control subjects to decrease medical utilization of the family practice clinic. The findings are consistent with earlier work showing an association between brief psychosocial intervention and decreases in the frequency of clinic visits. However, this study suggests that preinternship-level clinical psychology trainees can be equally as effective in providing this intervention as mental health professionals who have completed their training.\r"

Forty-one of the students interviewed trained, simulated patients and 22 interviewed real patients at their clerkship site. Students received feedback and faculty teaching of interviewing skills after the first interview. All students made another videotaped interview with a simulated patient at the conclusion of the clerkship. All interviews, pre- and post-clerkship, were scored for interviewing skills, focal areas, and nonverbal language. Multivariate and univariate analyses of pre- and post-interviews found simulated patients to be of most value in teaching medical students verbal interviewing skills and real patients to be of most value in teaching the focal content areas of the interview. Recommendations were made to include use of both simulated and real patients in the teaching of medical interviewing.\r"

  ".U": "87163213\r", 
  ".W": "Delayed gastric emptying is common in primary anorexia nervosa. We investigated in 12 patients whether gastric emptying could be accelerated by the prokinetic drug cisapride. Patients were studied on two occasions 1 wk apart and received, under random double-blind conditions, 8 mg of cisapride and placebo intravenously. Gastric emptying of an isotopically labeled semisolid meal and antral motor activity were measured using a dual-headed gamma-camera for 50 min. Emptying was significantly slower (half-emptying time, 50-191 min; median, 121 min) than in 24 healthy volunteers (half-emptying times, 21-119 min; median, 47 min). Cisapride accelerated emptying significantly (p less than 0.001; half-emptying time after cisapride, 22-80 min; median, 42 min). Antral contraction amplitude increased and contraction frequency decreased significantly (p less than 0.001), whereas the propagation velocity of contractions remained unchanged. We concluded that intravenous cisapride accelerates gastric emptying and increases antral contraction amplitude in patients with anorexia nervosa. Whether or not these effects can prove beneficial in diminishing the patients' symptoms and in helping them to gain weight can only be answered from studies involving long-term treatment with cisapride.\r"

Because topical beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) enemas have been used successfully in the treatment of distal idiopathic colitis, oral formulations of this drug were studied. Enteric-coated or uncoated capsules containing BDP were administered in a single-dose protocol on separate days to 6 healthy volunteers with postcolectomy ileostomies. Ileostomy effluent was collected for a minimum of 8 h and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography for BDP, its pharmacologically active derivative beclomethasone monopropionate (BMP), and inactive beclomethasone alcohol. Cellulose acetate phthalate coating of oral BDP capsules significantly increased the mean percentage recovery of BDP + BMP in ileal effluent (43.0% +/- 24.1%) compared to uncoated BDP capsules (13.5% +/- 8.5%, p less than 0.05, Student's paired t-test). We conclude that oral cellulose acetate phthalate-coated BDP capsules may merit clinical trial in Crohn's ileitis and ileocolitis or in conjunction with BDP enemas for topical treatment of ulcerative colitis involving the whole colon.\r"

In 6 animals, measurements of H2 clearance did not differ significantly in different regions of the sigmoid colon and they were highly reproducible (p less than 0.001) on different days. In a total of 12 dogs, measurements of H2 clearance correlated closely with those obtained using radioactive microspheres under resting conditions and, in 4 dogs, during infusion of vasopressin (slope = 0.94, p less than 0.001). In 8 dogs, ligation of the major arteries supplying the sigmoid colon resulted in an acute 60% decrease in sigmoid mucosal blood flow (p less than 0.001); however, in 5 animals that survived the procedure, mucosal blood flow returned nearly to control levels as early as 3 days after operation. Endoscopic H2 clearance thus appears to be feasible for measuring mucosal blood flow in the colon. Serial measurements of H2 clearance may prove useful in characterizing the role of mucosal blood flow in the pathogenesis of various forms of human colonic disease.\r"

In the forestomach, thickening of mucosa and hyperkeratosis appeared and papillomas frequently developed, but they did not occur in the control rats fed a semipurified diet. Mucous neck cells increased and parietal cells and chief cells decreased in the fundus. Goblet cells occurred in the antral glands, and intestinal metaplastic glands developed in the late stage of the experiment. The number of deoxyribonucleic acid-synthesizing cells in the glandular stomach was significantly higher than that of the control. Moreover, in the antrum, somatostatin-producing cells increased in the early stage and gastrin-producing cells decreased in the late stage. These results suggest that dietary protein might play a crucial role in the differentiation of gastric epithelium and the development of intestinal metaplasia in the stomach.\r"

After endoscopic assessment, 111 patients with essential dyspepsia were followed up by telephone interview every second month. Data were gathered, for a mean of 17 mo per patient, on the number of days of upper abdominal pain (the response variable) each month. In the 6-mo period before entry to the study the following predetermined predictor variables were collected: demographic factors (age, sex, social grade), number of pain days in the 6 mo before diagnosis, environmental factors (analgesics, nonsalicylate nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, alcohol, smoking, coffee, tea), length of dyspepsia history, and past history of peptic ulcer. Prospectively for each month of follow-up, the following additional variables were recorded: environmental factors, treatment, and development of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. It was found that patients with more pain before diagnosis were significantly more likely to have pain over the follow-up, and the taking of medications for dyspepsia and development of gastroesophageal reflux were associated with more days of pain over the follow-up (all p less than 0.001). Demographic and environmental factors, length of dyspepsia history, and a past history of ulcer were of no significant predictive value. There was a decrease in pain over the follow-up period (p = 0.002), but this effect was limited to the first two periods after endoscopic diagnosis.\r"

The lowest enzyme activities were found in patients with acute intermittent porphyria, and the highest ones in those with increased hemopoietic activity. Patients with liver cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis had porphobilinogen deaminase activities that were significantly higher than in normal subjects and did not depend on disease activity. In patients with acute hepatitis, porphobilinogen deaminase activities varied depending on the phase of disease, being normal at onset and after 3-4 mo, and elevated to the values observed in chronic liver disease between 2 and 4 wk of hospitalization. The differences in porphobilinogen deaminase activities between patients with liver disease and controls did not relate to red cell age as determined by density gradient centrifugation. Therefore, although the mechanism responsible for the increase in porphobilinogen deaminase activities in liver disease is not clear, the results of this study suggest that it is independent of the presence of immature red cells in the circulation.\r"

All patients were initially hepatitis B e antigen-positive and remained so during the study period.

Gallbladder and hepatic bile protein concentrations were measured using a fluorometric assay. The method was validated by an independent technique, i.e., hydrolysis and amino acid analysis. Persons with cholesterol gallstones had significantly higher gallbladder bile protein concentrations than patients without gallbladder disease or patients with pigment stones. The protein concentration correlated with the in vitro nucleation time in the cholesterol stone group. Gallbladder bile proteins were also purified by chromatography and gradient ultracentrifugation. Proteins from patients with cholesterol gallstones accelerated the nucleation time of control bile, whereas protein from controls had little effect. Hepatic bile protein concentrations were similar in persons with and without cholesterol gallstones. The gallbladder-to-hepatic bile ratios of a variety of solutes were examined. The ratio for protein in the cholesterol gallstone group can be explained straightforwardly by water reabsorption in the gallbladder, whereas the very low ratio in patients without cholesterol gallstones suggests that their gallbladders reduce protein mass by a process such as protein absorption or degradation during water absorption in the gallbladder.\r"

After intraduodenal administration of 14C-labeled compounds into bile fistula hamsters, radioactivity was exclusively recovered in bile; the more hydrophobic bile acid was absorbed more rapidly. Hepatic extraction of intravenously infused compounds was efficient and administered analogues became major biliary bile acids. Amidation of cholate was essentially complete, whereas 39% of 7 beta-methyl-cholate and 65% of 7 alpha-methyl-ursocholate were secreted in unconjugated form. After intragastric administration of the compounds, radioactivity was quantitatively recovered in feces. Cholate was 7-dehydroxylated to deoxycholate, whereas 31% of 7 beta-methyl-cholate and 78% of 7 alpha-methyl-ursocholate were recovered unchanged. Fifty percent of 7 beta-methyl-cholate and 15% of 7 alpha-methyl-ursocholate were transformed into ketonic derivatives, without loss of the 7-hydroxyl group. It is concluded that the introduction of the 7-methyl group did not interfere with intestinal absorption, hepatic extraction, and biliary secretion but did affect enzymatic amidation and bacterial 7-dehydroxylation of the analogues.\r"

Gallbladder emptying was quantitated using 99mTc-HIDA and a gamma-camera on line to a digital computer. Somatostatin, administered at a dosage of 7 micrograms/kg X h, prevented the gallbladder emptying responses to both test meals, sham feeding, and bethanechol. The maximal gallbladder emptying response to octapeptide of cholecystokinin at 5.0 ng/kg X min was reduced from 93.2% +/- 4.8% to 57.1% +/- 9.9% (p less than 0.01) and to octapeptide of cholecystokinin at 0.5 ng/kg X min from 91.3% +/- 5.3% to 14.8% +/- 4.2% (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that somatostatin is a potent inhibitor of gallbladder emptying in humans. This may be an important factor in the development of gallstones in patients with somatostatinomas.\r"

The results of CT scanning were subsequently evaluated in all patients by either surgery, autopsy, or percutaneous biopsy. Thirteen of 14 patients with CT scans positive for hepatic metastases and 5 of 13 patients with CT scans negative for hepatic metastases were found to have gastrinoma in the liver. For gastrinoma metastatic to the liver, CT scanning had a specificity of 98%, a sensitivity of 72%, a positive predictive value of 93%, and a negative predictive value of 90%. Twenty-two of 23 patients with positive extrahepatic CT scans and 15 of 33 patients with negative extrahepatic CT scans were found to have extrahepatic gastrinomas. For extrahepatic gastrinoma, CT scanning had a specificity of 95%, a sensitivity of 59%, a positive predictive value of 96%, and a negative predictive value of 54%. The ability of CT scan to detect gastrinomas both in the liver and extrahepatically was directly related to tumor size, detecting 0% of tumors less than 1 cm and 83%-95% of tumors greater than 3 cm. The location of the extrahepatic gastrinoma was also an important determinant in that approximately 80% of pancreatic gastrinomas but only 35% of extrapancreatic gastrinomas were detected. The present results indicate that because of its convenience and accuracy, CT scanning with oral and intravenous contrast material should be the initial procedure to evaluate the extent of gastrinoma. A positive CT scan is almost always correct; therefore, a CT scan detecting metastatic gastrinoma to the liver would avoid unnecessary surgery and, if positive for extrahepatic gastrinoma, would assist the surgeon in finding the gastrinoma. A negative CT is less reliable; therefore, patients should undergo other localizing studies before exploratory laparotomy.\r"

In addition, to define the role of angiography in the management of patients with gastrinoma, we compared the results of angiography with those of computed tomography (CT) scanning in 58 patients who underwent both tests. For gastrinoma in the liver, angiography had a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 86% with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 94%. For extrahepatic gastrinoma, angiography had a specificity of 94% and a sensitivity of 68%, a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 53%. Comparison of CT scanning and angiography demonstrated that for hepatic tumor CT demonstrated 72% and angiography 89% of tumors, and the combination detected all tumors with no false-positive results. Outside the liver, CT scanning detected 57%, angiography 70%, and the combination 73% of tumors with a false-positive rate of 7%. These results indicate that if a CT scan is performed first, then the addition of selective angiography will detect a further 28% of hepatic tumors and a further 16% of extrahepatic tumors, but that 24% of extrahepatic tumors will still be missed. Angiography is a useful adjunct to CT particularly in patients in whom surgery is contemplated.\r"

  ".W": "The colonic motor correlates of defecation were studied in 5 conscious dogs. A set of six strain-gauge transducers were implanted on the colon of each dog. An implanted cannula gave access to the terminal ileum. During a total control recording period of 230 h we observed 12 large-amplitude contractions that occurred spontaneously in the proximal colon and migrated caudad. We called them giant migrating contractions. The mean amplitude of these contractions was 2.8 times larger than the mean peak amplitude of phasic contractions during colonic motor complexes. The following stimuli were applied to induce defecation: 2 mg/kg guanethidine (i.v.), 30 micrograms/kg neostigmine (i.v.), 1-4 ml/kg castor oil (p.o.), 200 ml of 25% glucose (into ileum), and rectal distention by a balloon (120 ml). In 85% of experiments with guanethidine, neostigmine, glucose, and castor oil, giant migrating contractions occurred before defecation. The giant migrating contractions migrated over the entire colon or a part of its length. The migration velocity varied from 0.2 to 3.2 cm/s (mean +/- SE, 0.82 +/- 0.1 cm/s). In 11% of the experiments, giant contractions occurred almost simultaneously at different recording sites at the time of defecation. In 4% of the experiments giant contractions occurred only at a single site. Balloon expulsion was only rarely accompanied by giant contractions in the colon, and then occurred only at a distal site and did not migrate. We conclude that the colon has spontaneous but infrequent large-amplitude caudad-migrating contractions. These contractions may be the motor equivalent of mass movements. Defecation is usually preceded by colonic giant migrating contractions. The giant migrating contractions may provide a major force for defecation and be partially responsible for the evacuation of the colon during defecation. However, evacuation of contents such as a balloon seems to be possible without giant migrating contractions.\r"

The barostat measures tone by monitoring the volume of air within a flaccid intragastric bag, maintained at a constant, preselected pressure level by an electronic feedback mechanism. In healthy individuals, inter-digestive variations in gastric tone were phase-locked in advance of duodenal interdigestive motor activity and consisted of three sequential periods; a quiescence period, an intermediate period, and a period of activity. In contrast to controls, gastroparetic patients presented significantly larger intragastric volume at low intragastric pressure (6 mmHg). Gastric distention (14 mmHg) resulted in significantly reduced extension ratio and phasic motor response in the gastric remnant. Furthermore, distention elicited a symptomatic response that resembled their postcibal syndrome (epigastric fullness, pain, nausea). These data suggest that postsurgical gastroparesis is associated with impaired tone of the residual gastric pouch.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these experiments was to determine the contribution of gastrin to the acid secretory response to eating in healthy human subjects. To simulate the gastric and intestinal phases of eating, a meal was homogenized and then infused into the stomach through a nasogastric tube. At the same time, the cephalic phase of acid secretion was activated by sham feeding. With this simulated meal, mean serum gastrin concentration increased from a basal value of 43 +/- 9 pg/ml to an average postprandial gastrin concentration over 2 h of 121 +/- 25 pg/ml. Gastrin release after this simulated meal was similar to gastrin release after a normally eaten meal in the same 12 subjects. Gastric acid secretion in response to the simulated meal, which was measured by in vivo intragastric titration, averaged 24.2 +/- 2.4 mmol/h. To determine how much of this postprandial acid secretion could be attributed to gastrin, gastrin 17 I was infused intravenously in the same subjects on a separate day and acid secretion and serum gastrin concentrations were measured. By relating serum gastrin concentration during gastrin 17 infusion to concomitant acid secretion, we determined that an average postprandial serum gastrin concentration of 121 pg/ml could result in an acid secretion rate of 21.5 mmol/h, 89% of the actual acid secreted after the simulated meal in these subjects. However, in individual subjects, the amount of gastrin released after a meal could produce as little as 51% or as much as 162% of actual postprandial acid secretion. Thus, in individual human subjects the contribution of gastrin to acid secretion after a meal is variable.\r"

The aims of the present study were to test the hypothesis that the enzyme xanthine oxidase is the source of the oxygen radicals in the ischemic stomach and determine the importance of the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction in generating the cytotoxic oxygen radicals. Gastric mucosal clearance of 51Cr-labeled red blood cells was measured during a 30-min control period, a 30-min ischemic period (hemorrhage to 25 mmHg arterial pressure), and a 60-80-min reperfusion period (reinfusion of shed blood). In untreated (control) rats, a dramatic rise (100-fold) in the leakage of 51Cr-labeled red blood cells into the gastric lumen was observed only during the reperfusion period. After the reperfusion period, gastric mucosal damage was further assessed using gross lesion area and histology. Rats were placed on a sodium tungstate diet (to inactivate xanthine oxidase), or treated with either deferoxamine (an iron chelating agent) or superoxide dismutase (a superoxide scavenger). All three interventions substantially reduced 51Cr-labeled red blood cell clearance and gross lesion area relative to untreated rats. However, tissue injury assessed histologically was similar in both treated and untreated animals. The results of this study support the hypothesis that oxygen free radicals mediate the hemorrhagic shock-induced extravasation of red blood cells. The data also indicate that xanthine oxidase is the source of the oxy-radicals and that the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction is largely responsible for hydroxyl radical generation in this model.\r"

Glands were treated with HCO3-free Ringer's (100% O2 gassing) of different ionic composition and extracellular pH (pHo). In NaCl Ringer's steady state pHi = 7.15 was independent of pHo over the range pHo 7.1-7.8. This regulatory range of pHi (= 0.7 pH units) was abolished by sodium-free Ringer's or addition of 10(-3) M amiloride and also by 10(-4) M ouabain. Chloride-free Ringer's or 2 X 10(-4) M SITS caused an elevation of pHi to 7.5, and the regulatory range was reduced in magnitude to 0.50 pH units (pHo 7.3-7.8). At pHo values outside the regulatory ranges, pHi was linearly related to pHo, although the specific slope that related pHi to pHo depended on the composition of the external solution. In potassium gluconate Ringer's, pHi was completely independent of pHo. The data suggest that Na/H exchange is primarily responsible for the regulation of pHi over a wide range of pHo, although the specific pHi and the range of regulation are affected by the activity of the Cl/OH (HCO3) exchanger; the movement of protons or hydroxyl ions, or both, across gland cell membranes appears to be mediated under most circumstances by these two exchangers.\r"

These 38 patients with spinal cord injury were age-, sex-, and race-matched with 38 patients without spinal cord injury who underwent an autopsy during the same period. Gallstone disease was significantly more prevalent in patients with spinal cord injury (11 of 38 or 29%) compared to the control population (4 of 38 or 11%) (p less than 0.05; odds ratio of 3.46 with 95% confidence interval of 1.08-11.24). A significant difference in age or level or duration of spinal cord injury was not found between patients with spinal cord injury who had gallstone disease and those who did not. Possible explanations for this threefold increase in risk of gallstone disease among patients with spinal cord injury include abnormal gallbladder motility resulting in stasis, decreased intestinal transit leading to an abnormal enterohepatic circulation, and metabolic changes leading to abnormal biliary lipid secretion.\r"

Cycling of plasma motilin was not affected by long-term sympathectomy but coordination of peak levels of plasma motilin and initiation of gastric migrating myoelectric complexes was disrupted in decentralized dogs.

The purpose of this study was to examine both the passive and active membrane properties of circular smooth muscle at proximal and distal esophageal sites so as to delineate the role of myogenic properties in the intramural mechanism of peristalsis. Intracellular recordings were made in circular muscle strips taken from proximal (8 cm above the gastroesophageal junction) and distal (2 cm above the gastroesophageal junction) sites in 10 opossums using the partition method of Abe and Tomita. At both esophageal sites, determinations were made of resting membrane potentials, time constants, space constants, thresholds for action potentials, action potential amplitudes, rates of rise of action potentials, and action potential durations at half-amplitude. The values for these parameters at the proximal and distal sites, respectively, were as follows: mean resting membrane potential, 49.7 +/- 0.24 and 49.5 +/- 0.3 mV; length constant, 4.0 +/- 0.4 and 3.8 +/- 0.4 mm; time constant, 513 +/- 49 and 456 +/- 53 ms; threshold for action potentials, 9.3 +/- 0.4 and 8.8 +/- 0.3 mV; amplitude of action potentials, 36.0 +/- 5.2 and 35.3 +/- 1.7 mV; rate of rise of action potentials, 2.3 +/- 0.3 and 2.6 +/- 0.4 mV/ms; duration of action potentials at half-amplitude, 5.0 +/- 1.2 and 4.1 +/- 0.4 ms; and the conduction velocity for evoked potentials, 3.9 +/- 0.3 and 3.8 +/- 0.4 cm/s. Our studies show that there are no differences between proximal and distal esophageal sites in any of these determinations. These studies also show that regional differences in the electrical membrane properties of circular smooth muscle do not account for esophageal peristalsis.\r"

The study was divided into three parts. In part 1, a dose-response study was performed in 7 dogs to estimate the 95% effective dose for four pharmacologic agents known to cause gastric dysrhythmia. In part 2, we determined the relative efficacy of three putative blockers in preventing pharmacologic induction of gastric dysrhythmia. In part 3, several ancillary experiments were performed. The results show that an intraarterial bolus of epinephrine, met-enkephalin, prostaglandin E2, and glucagon each induced episodes of gastric dysrhythmia, whereas saline injections did not. The 95% effective dose of these dysrhythmic drugs were 10.5, 77.0, 35.0, and 407.0 micrograms/kg, respectively. The dysrhythmic action of epinephrine was blocked by phentolamine and indomethacin but not by naloxone. The dysrhythmic action of met-enkephalin was blocked by naloxone and indomethacin but not by phentolamine. The dysrhythmic action of glucagon was not blocked by phentolamine, naloxone, or indomethacin. The inhibitory effect of indomethacin on epinephrine-induced gastric dysrhythmia was shared by meclofenamate. Thus, we conclude that local prostaglandins mediate the production of gastric dysrhythmias by epinephrine and met-enkephalin; however, glucagon causes gastric dysrhythmias by a non-prostaglandin-mediated mechanism.\r"

In vitro studies demonstrated an excellent correlation (r greater than or equal to 0.94; p less than 0.001) between the pressure obtained with the capsule and intraluminal pressure over a range of vessel diameters and wall thicknesses. In vivo correlation of pressures obtained with the capsule with direct venous pressure measurements was excellent (r = 0.85). However, this correlation decreased with a decrease in vessel diameter (group 1 diameter greater than or equal to 10 mm, r = 0.95; group 2 diameter greater than or equal to 5 mm but less than 10 mm, r = 0.75; group 3 diameter greater than or equal to 3 mm but less than 5 mm, r = 0.81). This decrease in accuracy was significant (p less than 0.001) between group 1 and groups 2 and 3. In vitro and in vivo, capsule pressure variability was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) in vessels of smaller diameter. Wall tension significantly influenced capsule pressure (p less than 0.05), although this effect was only seen in large \"vessels\" with a diameter beyond a clinically relevant range. Therefore, despite obtaining technically acceptable capsule pressure measurements in ideal experimental conditions, the accuracy and variability of these measurements are limited by vessel size.\r"

Tissue from the proximal and distal colon of each animal was incubated with Triticum vulgaris, Arachis hypogaea, Glycine max, or Ulex europeus agglutinin I. Formalin-fixed paraffin sections and unfixed frozen sections were coded, read blindly, and graded from negative (-) or weak (+) to intensely positive (4+). The results showed a unique developmental pattern for each lectin, although in all cases the adult binding pattern was established by weaning. Alterations in the binding pattern between paraffin and frozen sections were noted only for Arachis hypogaea and Glycine max. Minimal Glycine max binding was seen at any age in paraffin sections, although in frozen sections a weak but consistent supranuclear binding was seen in goblet cells of postnatal animals. In contrast, both the brush-border and goblet cells were intensely fluorescent after exposure to Triticum vulgaris. This fluorescence was present in both regions at all ages studied. Ulex europeus agglutinin I also labeled goblet cells in the fetal and neonatal colon, but late in the suckling period regional differences appeared. This resulted in a significant loss of labeled goblet cells distally and a restriction of Ulex europeus agglutinin I-positive cells to the base of the crypts proximally. Finally, Arachis hypogaea showed a transient brush-border binding in paraffin sections of the proximal colon before weaning, whereas frozen sections revealed a supranuclear localization in goblet cells in both regions after birth. These studies indicate significant changes in membrane-associated and goblet cell secretory glycoconjugates in the developing rat colon.\r"

This report demonstrates that infection of the terminal ileum with M. avium-intracellulare in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome can present with a clinical and radiologic picture resembling Crohn's disease.

Cells of the T84 line appear to be a useful model for studies of Cl- secretion. We now define the fine structure of this cell line, the structural events that occur during monolayer formation, and the influence of plastic versus collagen substrates and permeable versus impermeable substrates on the structural development of these monolayers. When plated on collagen-coated filters at confluency, T84 cells cover the filter surface and lay down basement membrane-like material within 18 h. Such \"monolayers\" multifocally display areas with many cell layers alternating with areas composed of a single layer of cells. During this stage of development cell polarization is minimal, ultrastructural discontinuities exist that impart low transepithelial resistance, and morphologic features reminiscent of stratified intestinal epithelium during fetal development are present. Within 5 days of plating on collagen-coated filters, true monolayers form. These monolayers have high transepithelial resistance and consist of highly polarized columnar cells with structural similarity to intestinal crypt cells. Cells plated on a plastic substrate are also capable of rapidly producing basement membrane-like material but, unlike those plated on collagen-coated filters, under these conditions the rapid initial spreading of cells over the substrate surface does not occur. As a result, at 5 days monolayers plated on plastic are less uniform than those plated on collagen-coated filters, exhibit areas in which unpolarized flattened cells abound, and multifocally leak macromolecules. Studies using collagen-coated filters made impermeant with glass backing suggest that the enhancing effect of this substrate on monolayer structural development is not simply due to the greater access that basolateral membranes have to nutrient media when grown on permeable supports. This study defines the structure and structural development of this useful model epithelium, and demonstrates the importance of substrate selection.\r"

  ".W": "The management alternatives of segmental colonic resection versus follow-up alone for colonic adenomas containing early invasive carcinoma (i.e., polypectomy resection margin free of tumor) were evaluated by decision tree analysis. Using data from the literature, the major variables influencing the decision were as follows: probability of residual disease after polypectomy, operative efficacy (defined as the chance of curing a tumor that would otherwise recur without surgery), and operative mortality. For a hypothetical patient with low operative risk (operative mortality of 0.2%), resection would yield the best outcome in terms of life expectancy as long as the probability of residual disease was greater than 0.5%. Extensive analysis of the impact of changes in assumptions about the parameters characterizing the problem showed this conclusion to be unchanging over wide ranges of operative efficacy and probability of residual disease. However, the decision to do a secondary resection in this situation was still close because surgery was only marginally justifiable on economic grounds. Observation would be preferred in patients with higher operative risk (operative mortality greater than 2%).\r"

To that effect, on consecutive days, either peroral or intravenous ethanol was administered in both fed and fasted states to 7 nonalcoholic and 18 alcoholic subjects. In nonalcoholics consuming 0.15 g/kg body wt ethanol, the magnitude of first-pass metabolism of ethanol was 3.94 +/- 0.15 mmol/L X h, calculated as the difference of the areas under the curve obtained after oral and intravenous alcohol administration. The first-pass metabolism accounted for 73% of the latter. When the administered dose was increased to 0.3 g/kg body wt ethanol, the corresponding values were 6.46 +/- 0.50 mmol/L X h and 44%. Fasting decreased this effect. When alcoholics consumed 0.15 g/kg body wt ethanol, the corresponding values were 0.92 +/- 0.65 mmol/L X h and 23%. When these alcoholics were fasted, the first-pass metabolism again decreased and it was significantly lower than in the nonalcoholics tested under the same conditions. We conclude that in humans a significant fraction of ingested alcohol undergoes first-pass metabolism but that this effect is reduced in alcoholics and by fasting. The magnitude of this process determines the bioavailability of alcohol and thus modulates its potential toxicity.\r"

Abnormalities of oncogenes were found in 22% of cancers at the time of resection. Amplification of c-myc or c-erbB-2 and allelic deletion of c-ras-Ha or c-myb were the most frequent abnormalities. The presence of altered oncogenes did not correlate with Dukes' stage, tumor progression, or patient survival after resection. One adenoma had an allelic deletion of the c-myb oncogene which was not seen in either the normal colon or an adjacent carcinoma. These data indicate that the spectrum of altered protooncogenes in colon carcinoma is similar to that of other adenocarcinomas, and that unstable oncogenes can be found before overt malignancy develops.\r"

  ".W": "Cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies to somatostatin, designated S10 and S20, have recently been generated. The purpose of the present immunoneutralization study was to examine the ability of these antibodies to block the inhibitory effect of exogenous somatostatin on meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion in the innervated rat stomach and to use these antibodies as probes to determine if somatostatin is involved in intestinal fat-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion. The plateau acid secretory response to a liver extract meal in this model was 28 +/- 2 mu Eq/30 min. Intravenous infusion of somatostatin at 2.0 micrograms/kg X h or intraduodenal oleic acid at 1.2 ml/h reduced this response to 12 +/- 1 and 14 +/- 1 mu Eq/30 min, respectively. The antibodies were given intravenously 1 h before the meal and either somatostatin or intraduodenal oleic acid infusion. S10 preinfusion returned the plateau meal responses to the levels seen with the meal alone: 25 +/- 4 and 26 +/- 1 mu Eq/30 min, respectively. S20 preinfusion had no effect, the responses being 14 +/- 1 and 16 +/- 1 mu Eq/30 min, respectively. These results demonstrate successful binding of exogenous somatostatin by S10 in vivo and reversal of intestinal fat-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion by S10 preinfusion. It is concluded that the mechanism whereby fat in the small intestine inhibits gastric acid secretion may involve the release of somatostatin.\r"

  ".W": "A unicenter, single-blind, randomized study was conducted on 283 patients with active duodenal ulcer to compare possible factors that may affect healing and relapse in patients treated with a potent antisecretory agent, cimetidine, or a site-protective and cytoprotective agent, sucralfate. The endoscopic healing rates at 4 wk were 76% and 79%, respectively, and cross-over treatment of the failures for a further 4 wk resulted in 68% healing with cimetidine and 69% healing with sucralfate, both differences being not statistically different. Unlike cimetidine, healing by sucralfate was unaffected by cigarette smoking, reluctance to give up smoking, habitual use of alcohol, high maximal acid output, and large ulcer diameter. In particular, the healing rate of smokers treated with sucralfate (82%) was significantly greater than that of smokers treated with cimetidine (63%). Duodenal bulb deformity significantly affected healing in both groups, and was the only offsetting factor identifiable for sucralfate out of 46 factors examined. Of the patients with healed ulcers, 238 participated in a 24-mo follow-up study consisting of interviews at 2-mo intervals and endoscopy at 4-mo intervals or whenever symptoms recurred. The cumulative relapse rate was significantly (p less than 0.007) greater in patients healed with cimetidine than with sucralfate, 50% relapse occurring at 6 and 12 mo, respectively. In both, the cumulative relapse rate was significantly greater in cigarette smokers than in nonsmokers, but smokers and nonsmokers treated with cimetidine relapsed (50% at 4 and 8 mo, respectively) faster than the corresponding smokers and nonsmokers treated with sucralfate (50% at 8 and 18 mo, respectively). Furthermore, in cimetidine- but not sucralfate-healed patients, early ulcer relapse (within 6 mo) was associated with short duration of illness, short remission period, long symptomatic spell, and reluctance to give up smoking. We conclude that smoking adversely affects duodenal ulcer healing by cimetidine and hastens subsequent relapse, and that sucralfate overcomes the adverse effect of smoking on healing as encountered with cimetidine, and results in a subsequent remission period double that of cimetidine.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a novel gut peptide, peptide YY (PYY), on the cephalic, gastric, and intestinal phases of gastric acid secretion and to explore the mechanisms involved. The cephalic phase of gastric acid secretion, stimulated by the intravenous injection of 2-deoxyglucose (75 mg/kg), was found to be inhibited by intravenous PYY (100, 200, 400 pmol/kg X h) in a dose-related fashion. Peptide YY (200 and 400 pmol/kg X h) also resulted in a significant dose-dependent inhibition of the gastric phase of acid secretion. On the other hand, PYY (400 pmol/kg X h) failed to affect the intestinal phase of gastric acid output. Serum gastrin levels were increased on infusion of 10% liver extract into stomach, but were unaffected on instillation of liver extract into duodenum. Peptide YY did not inhibit the release of gastrin in either the gastric or intestinal phase studies. Furthermore, PYY had no significant effect on either the basal release of secretin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, pancreatic polypeptide, or neurotensin, or on the stimulated release of pancreatic polypeptide by 2-deoxyglucose. The specific binding of gastrin to its receptors on the fundic mucosa was also unaffected by PYY. These results indicate that PYY inhibits the cephalic and gastric phases of acid secretion independently, and that its actions are not mediated by either a negative effect on gastrin release or a positive effect on the release of some of the known acid inhibitors, or by an inhibition of gastrin binding to its receptors on the fundic cells. Our present findings (in combination with our previous findings of inhibition of pentagastrin- and bethanechol-stimulated gastric acid secretion by PYY, independent of the vagal cholinergic mechanism) indicate that the action of PYY is either direct on the parietal cells or is mediated by yet another, unidentified, inhibitor.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to assess the extent of collateral blood flow provided by the celiac and inferior mesenteric arteries to the intestines during total occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). In anesthetized cats, blood flow to the pancreas, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon was measured with radioactive micropheres (15 microns in diameter) before and during occlusion of the SMA. Superior mesenteric artery occlusion significantly decreased (by 63%) blood flow to the head of the pancreas. Flow to the neck and tail of the pancreas was not altered. Blood flow to the proximal and distal duodenum was significantly reduced by 35% and 61%, respectively. Along the entire jejunum and ileum, SMA occlusion markedly decreased blood flow by an average of 71%. In the proximal colon, blood flow decreased by 63%, whereas flow to the middle and distal colon was not affected by SMA occlusion. Reduction in total wall blood flow to the small and large intestines was largely due to a marked reduction in mucosa/submucosa blood flow; muscularis/serosa flow was not affected. The results of this study suggest that total occlusion of the SMA does not compromise blood flow to the neck and tail of the pancreas and middle and distal colon (tissues that are normally perfused with blood from either the celiac or inferior mesenteric arteries). Perfusion through collaterals maintains flow to the head of the pancreas and gut (from duodenum to proximal colon) to within 30%-65% of control (preocclusion) flow. An important new observation of this study is that collateral blood vessels are much more effective in preventing ischemia in the muscularis/serosa than in the mucosa/submucosa after SMA occlusion.\r"

Plasma concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay using antibodies specific for intact G-17, and for the C- and N- terminus of G-17, during and after infusion of both sulfated and unsulfated G-17. With all three antibodies, plasma concentrations at a steady state were higher during infusion of sulfated compared with unsulfated G-17. In addition, the half-life in plasma measured by the three antibodies was two to five times higher for sulfated G-17 compared with unsulfated G-17. The half-life measured by N-terminal-specific antibodies was greater than that with antibodies specific for C-terminal or intact G-17. The difference was accounted for by the production during infusion of N-terminal fragments of relatively long half-life. The pattern of fragments generated during infusion of sulfated G-17 resembled that during unsulfated G-17 infusion, but there was no evidence of desulfation in the systemic circulation. The results indicate that in humans, sulfation protects G-17 from metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "87163268\r", 
  ".W": "We and others recently have demonstrated adenosine triphosphate-dependent acidification in a variety of prelysosomal organelles isolated from liver including clathrin-coated vesicles, multivesicular bodies, and Golgi. Little is known, however, regarding the number or distribution of acidic compartments in intact hepatocytes. We therefore have utilized acridine orange, a fluorescent weak base, to study the number and distribution of acidic vesicles of rat hepatocytes in primary culture and compared these with the number and distribution of lysosomes and other storage vesicles. Hepatocytes were found to contain about 170 acidic compartments per cell by fluorescence microscopy. These vesicles were diffusely distributed throughout the cell cytoplasm, with about 50% in the perinuclear area by modified morphometry. The acridine orange staining of these vesicles was reversibly dissipated by monensin, NH4Cl, chloroquine, and primaquine, indicating these vesicles exhibit an acidic interior established by active proton transport. In addition, the cholestatic agent chlorpromazine reversibly inhibited, in a dose-dependent fashion, the redevelopment of a pH gradient in the acidic vesicles after dissipation by monensin. The number and distribution of these acidic vesicles were not significantly different from the number and distribution of vesicles involved in the storage (up to 6 h after internalization) of the fluid phase marker fluorescein-dextran. By contrast, histochemically identifiable lysosomes were fewer in number and significantly more restricted in their distribution to the perinuclear area (89%) than either dextran-storing or acidic vesicles. Electron microscopic studies confirmed that endocytosed dextran as well as another fluid phase marker, colloidal gold, were found predominantly in acid phosphatase- and arylsulfatase-negative vesicles for up to 6 h after internalization. These studies indicate that hepatocytes contain numerous intracellular vesicles acidified by an active H+ transport mechanism. Based on their comparative number and distribution, acidic vesicles probably include vesicles involved in fluid-phase endocytosis but only a minority are lysosomes. The findings also indicate that fluid-phase markers are stored predominantly in vesicles other than histochemically identifiable lysosomes for up to 6 h after internalization. Finally, this technique also affords the opportunity for studying the movement of such vesicles in a vital preparation.\r"

The procedure was instituted at St. Mary's Medical Center's hospital in February 1985. During the first 12 months, a total of 321 patients were examined: 212 inpatients and 109 outpatients. In those patients with complete information, primary panendoscopy changed the diagnosis in 67% and the treatment in 52%. As expected, the number of esophagogastroduodenoscopies decreased during this time, but the combined numbers of primary panendoscopies and esophagogastroduodenoscopies exceeded the projected increase of esophagogastroduodenoscopies. Similarly, the number of UGI x-ray examinations fell sharply. With a physician fee of $150.00 and a facility fee of $50.00, theoretical savings of some $117,000.00 to the patients were estimated. The authors conclude that primary panendoscopy provides a cost-effective and beneficial patient service that warrants broad consideration by gastroenterologists as they face the cost constraints being imposed within the health care system of the 1980s.\r"

In one of two neonates with choledochal cyst, the common bile duct was demonstrated. In six of seven neonates (86%) with biliary atresia, only the pancreatic duct was demonstrated and the diagnosis was suspected. Although absence of a common bile duct opacification does not rule out biliary atresia, ERCP with the new duodenoscope proved to be most useful in the diagnosis of normal biliary tree and served to avoid unnecessary surgery in most infants with neonatal cholestasis.\r"

In addition, Gruentzig-type balloons were placed endoscopically to dilate severe biliary duct strictures in eight of these patients, and endoprostheses were inserted to bridge high grade strictures in three patients. In order to assess the effectiveness of endoscopic treatment, we compared the number of hospitalizations for clinical episodes of cholangitis in this patient group for similar periods of time before and after therapy. Episodes of cholangitis requiring hospitalization decreased from 2.5 +/- 0.4 per patient in the 12 months prior to endoscopic therapy to 0.2 +/- 0.2 episodes per patient in the year following treatment and to 0.33 +/- 0.2 episodes per patient in the additional follow-up period during the second year. Liver function tests have improved significantly over the follow-up period of 19.1 +/- 2.6 months from the time of endoscopic treatment. The serum bilirubin decreased from 6.9 +/- 2.0 mg/dl to 2.7 +/- 1.4 mg/dl; serum alkaline phosphatase decreased from 959 +/- 214 IU to 385 +/- 89 IU; and serum transaminase decreased from 117 +/- 17 IU to 77 +/- 12 IU. Endoscopic treatment appears to be effective in patients with severe sclerosing cholangitis.\r"

A focused approach based on clues from a detailed history and physical exam and knowledge of how age-related physiologic changes can affect presentation of illness in the elderly is emphasized. Treatment should focus on preventing recurrence, and the physician should take into consideration associated age and disease-related changes that may lead to iatrogenic complications. However, therapy should not be denied purely because of the patient's age.\r"

  ".W": "Older patients with both hypertension and pulmonary disease pose a challenge to the physician. Satisfactory blood-pressure control must be achieved without exacerbating the concomitant pulmonary disease. Diuretics may interfere with mucus production and cause acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities. The beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be avoided because of their risk of inducing bronchospasm. If a beta blocker must be used, it should be combined with an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker, or an agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or beta 1 selectivity. The direct and indirect vasodilators may be used safely in these patients, but the risk of worsening any underlying coronary artery disease must be kept in mind when prescribing either hydralazine or minoxidil. The calcium channel blockers and ACE-inhibitors have the best safety record in treating the elderly who have hypertension and COPD. For these patients, the calcium channel blockers offer the advantage of simultaneous therapy of coronary artery disease, whereas hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure would be more likely to benefit from an ACE-inhibitor. The ability to treat hypertension without precipitating unwanted adverse reactions or dangerous side effects is one of the arts of medicine. Fortunately, the range of drugs available to today's physician allows safe and efficacious treatment of the elderly patient who has both hypertension and pulmonary disease.\r"

Other illnesses that might be present instead of or in addition to depression should be sought, both before depression therapy is started and also in the face of persistent symptoms after treatment is started. Basic treatment is with antidepressant medications, with careful attention to selection of drug and dosage, and careful monitoring for adverse effects. Antidepressant therapy and any other applicable forms of therapy are not mutually exclusive, and any other means of improving the patient's overall situation should be vigorously sought.\r"

Although increasing age is a major risk factor for surgery, the increased incidence of major diseases may be more important than age alone. Emergency surgery also involves considerably greater risk. It is important that the patient be involved in the decision-making process to the extent possible, and also that adequate postoperative and discharge planning be part of the preoperative management of the elderly person.\r"

This was associated with a compensatory increase in the activity of the initial and rate controlling enzyme of the pathway delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) synthase at 866 +/- 636 nmol ALA/g/protein/h compared with 156 +/- 63 in controls (p less than 0.001). Unlike variegate porphyria in which there is a genetic deficiency of PROTO oxidase there was no increased excretion of porphyrins or their precursors in Gilbert's syndrome. Accentuation and subsequent correction of the unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with rifampicin produced reciprocal changes in PROTO oxidase activity indicating that bilirubin may be inhibiting the activity of this enzyme.\r"

There were 13 patients with gall bladder disease, 12 with normal gall bladders and 13 postcholecystectomy. Gastric juice was obtained by intubation. Bile acid concentrations were compared with 21 controls and 15 asymptomatic subjects with gall bladder disease. For 21 patients with gall bladder disease who underwent cholecystectomy, levels were again assessed postoperatively to allow correlation with outcome. The occurrence of reflux and the resultant gastric juice bile acids did not correlate with symptoms. Concentrations postcholecystectomy, including asymptomatic subjects were significantly higher than controls (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that limited duodenogastric reflux is common and need not be associated with symptoms even when the resultant intra-gastric concentrations are higher than normal.\r"

Reviewing an average follow up period of 22 months (range 6-60) after therapeutic endoscopy and 57 months (range 1-126) after different surgical procedures, we conclude that endoscopic sphincterotomy with removal of the debris is as efficient a therapy of the 'sump syndrome' as surgical sphincteroplasty and entails a smaller risk for the patient. We therefore advocate that endoscopic papillotomy should first be tried in all cases of 'sump syndrome' in the absence of suprapapillary stricture of the bile ducts.\r"

All the symptoms were more prevalent than in 17 normal volunteers or in 301 apparently healthy people studied previously.

When 24 constipated subjects received effective laxative treatment the prevalence and severity of these symptoms fell markedly.

A low dose of PYY was chosen to give plasma concentrations within the range seen postprandially in healthy subjects, while the high dose mimicked the raised levels seen in several malabsorptive conditions. During infusion of PYY at 0.18 pmol/kg/min plasma concentrations rose from a basal of 8 +/- 2 pmol/l to 38 +/- 5 pmol/l and at 0.51 pmol/kg/min to 87 +/- 10 pmol/l. Mouth to caecum transit time was delayed from 67 +/- 4 mins on the saline infusion day to 94 +/- 7 mins (p less than 0.01) on the low dose and 192 +/- 9 mins (p less than 0.001) on the high dose infusion day. Time to 50% gastric emptying was prolonged from 37 +/- 8 mins during saline infusion to 63 +/- 10 mins (p less than 0.05) during low and 130 +/- 12 mins (p less than 0.001) during high dose infusion. Thus the infusion of PYY shows a dose related inhibition of mouth to caecum intestinal transit time and of the rate of gastric emptying and suggests this novel hormonal peptide to be of importance in gastrointestinal physiology.\r"

  ".W": "Refeeding starved rats with an elemental diet resulted in a marked increase in crypt cell production rate (CCPR) in the proximal small intestine but not in the distal regions of the gut. Little effect on CCPR was noted when inert bulk (kaolin) was added to the elemental diet. Addition of a poorly fermentable dietary fibre (purified wood cellulose) had little effect on intestinal epithelial cell proliferation except in the distal colon where it significantly increased CCPR. A more readily fermentable fibre (purified wheat bran) caused a large proliferative response in the proximal, mid, and distal colon and in the distal small intestine. A gel forming fibre only significantly stimulated proliferation in the distal colon; the rats in this group, however, did not eat all the food given. There was no significant correlation between CCPR and plasma gastrin concentrations, but plasma enteroglucagon concentrations were significantly correlated with CCPR in almost all the sites studied. Plasma PYY concentrations also showed some correlation with CCPR, especially in the colon. Thus while inert bulk cannot stimulate colonic epithelial cell proliferation fermentable fibre is capable of stimulating proliferation in the colon, and especially in the distal colon: it can also stimulate proliferation in the distal small intestine and it is likely that plasma enteroglucagon may have a role to play in this process.\r"

  ".W": "The relative in vitro anti-oxidant efficacy of sulphasalazine (salicylazosulphapyridine, SASP) and its metabolites (5-aminosalicylic acid, 5-ASA; sulphapyridine, SP) was examined by studying their effects on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using zymosan-stimulated polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) and a cell free, xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. Salicylazosulphapyridine, 5-ASA, and SP showed anti-oxidant effects to the various degrees. In particular, production of OH, which is one of the most potent reactive oxygen species, was remarkably suppressed by 5-ASA dose relatedly. These findings suggest that SASP and its metabolites play an important role in the inhibition of respiratory bursts. As the potent products of the respiratory burst by polymorphonuclear leucocytes are thought to be important inflammatory mediators, suppression of toxic reactive oxygen species generation by these agents may partly explain the therapeutic efficacy of SASP in ulcerative colitis, which is characterised by an acute mucosal inflammation dominated by polymorphonuclear leucocytes accumulation.\r"

After 45 minutes acetyl 5ASA became the dominant compound and after seven hours serum concentrations of both components were almost unrecordable. Orally ingested 5ASA in three preparations to ensure its release in the stomach, small intestine and ileocaecal region respectively gave lower serum concentrations and urinary excretion than those obtained after an intravenous infusion. Bioavailabilities which ranged from 19% for ileocaecal release to 75% for release in the upper gastrointestinal tract, were calculated from areas under the serum concentration curves. Urinary excretion of 5ASA and its acetyl metabolite over 48 hours was 78%, 52%, 55%, and 21% respectively of the dose given intravenously and orally for gastric, small intestinal and ileocaecal release.\r"

No differences in the basal secretion of gastrin and somatostatin were observed among the two groups. Alkaline as well as acidic intragastric pH had no effect on the antral release of somatostatin in duodenal ulcer patients and controls. In contrast, alkaline intragastric pH was associated with a significantly higher antral gastrin release in duodenal ulcer patients than in controls. Acidic intragastric pH was associated with a significantly smaller inhibition of antral gastrin release in duodenal ulcer patients than in controls. These results suggest that atropinised anaesthetised duodenal patients release gastrin abnormally in the presence of acidic or alkaline intragastric pH and that any inverse relationship between antral gastrin and somatostatin release is uncoupled under these conditions.\r"

Ninety nine subjects entered the short term and 79 the long term study (12 months). The following parameters were taken into account: therapy, sex, age, smoking habit, alcohol consumption, analgesic intake, peptic ulcer family history and onset of the disease. Results of the studies were analysed by means of chi 2 test and logistic regression, both in stepwise and in specifying models. Cigarette smoking was found to be the most important risk factor of non-healing (p = 0.04). In women with late onset of the disease, cigarette smoking identified the gastric ulcer subjects at higher risk of non-healing with a predictive probability of 0.4679. Age under 50 years was found to be the most important risk factor of relapsing throughout the entire 12 month follow up period (p = 0.025). In those under 50 years, cigarette smoking and negative peptic ulcer family history in combination, identified the gastric ulcer subjects at higher risk of relapsing, the predicted probability being 0.6027. It is concluded that cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor for non-healing and those who relapse under the age of 50. The possibility of singling out categories of patients more prone not to heal and to relapse suggests new strategies in the management of gastric ulcer disease.\r"

In order to resolve this controversy, we have assessed endogenous nitrosation by the independent N-nitrosoproline excretion test in subjects who had previously undergone gastric juice analysis by one of these methods. Ten Polya gastrectomy, 10 pernicious anaemia and nine matched control subjects were fed 380 mg of nitrate in beetroot juice and 500 mg proline. N-nitrosoproline (N-Pro) synthesised intragastrically from these precursors, and quantitatively excreted by the kidneys, was measured in 24 hour urine samples (collection checked by creatinine clearance). N-Pro excretion (mean +/- SEM) was reduced (p less than 0.01) in pernicious anaemia (1.1 +/- 0.8 ng/day) compared with matched control (18.0 +/- 7.2 ng/day), and also tended to be lower (NS) in polya gastrectomy (3.2 +/- 2.3 ng/day). Twenty four hour intragastric pH was monitored on a separate occasion in 23 of the 29 subjects; 13 were hypoacidic (pH greater than 4 greater than 50% of 24 hours) and 10 were acidic. N-Pro yields were reduced (p less than 0.01) in the hypoacidic group (0.9 +/- 0.6 ng/day) compared with the acidic group (17.9 +/- 6.6 ng/day), and N-Pro was negatively associated with mean intragastric pH (tau = -0.53, p = 0.001). We conclude that endogenous synthesis of this specific N-nitroso compound is favoured by low rather than high pH. These results are concordant with those previously reported in gastric juice from the same subjects and suggest that nitrosation is chemically rather than bacterially mediated, contrary to the nitrosamine hypothesis of gastric carcinogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of canalicular bile secretion have been limited due to lack of direct access to the canalicular lumen. Isolated rat hepatocyte couplets, consisting of two hepatocytes enclosing a canalicular space, have been proposed as a primary secretory unit that may be useful for direct studies of unmodified canalicular bile secretion. The present study examines their structural characteristics and plasma membrane reorganization. The canalicular space of freshly isolated hepatocyte couplets is freely permeable to ruthenium red, but within 4 hr the junctional borders reseal in most couplets which then exclude ruthenium red from the luminal area. These resealed spaces expand in 61.8 +/- 10% of couplets as secretion is elaborated and after 4 hr in monolayer culture, 12.7 +/- 4.7% of the canalicular spaces are dilated to diameters greater than 3 microns. Normal-appearing microvilli line these canalicular membranes in the majority of dilated spaces as assessed by electron microscopy. Immediately after isolation, Mg++-ATPase, a histochemical marker for canalicular membranes, is located as a discrete band corresponding to the normal in vivo circumferential distribution of the canalicular membrane domain. However, this pattern of Mg++-ATPase staining rapidly diminishes and reorganizes at the remaining canalicular pole within several hours. This membrane reorganization is a microfilament-dependent process, since it is inhibited by cytochalasin D but not by colchicine, an inhibitor of microtubular function or cycloheximide, an inhibitor of new protein synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After intravenous injection of [3H]leukotriene C4, the initial half-life of radioactivity circulating in blood was 79 +/- 15 sec (S.D.) in transport mutant rats as compared to 31 +/- 6 sec (S.D.) in normal Wistar rats. The intrahepatic leukotriene radioactivity was increased 5-fold after 1 hr in mutant rats, while the biliary elimination of [3H]leukotrienes was reduced to 1.8% of control. In normal rats, 77 +/- 7% (S.D.) of the administered leukotriene radioactivity were recovered in bile within 1 hr. The total recovery of radioactivity from bile, urine, liver, intestine, stomach, kidneys, muscular system and blood 1 hr after intravenous [3H]leukotriene C4 was 89 +/- 6% (S.D.) in normal rats and 46 +/- 4% (S.D.) in transport mutants. Enterohepatic circulation was studied after intraduodenal administration of N-acetyl-[3H]leukotriene E4, a major cysteinyl leukotriene metabolite in rat bile. In transport mutants, hepatobiliary elimination of the intestinally absorbed [3H]leukotriene was reduced to 5%, whereas urinary excretion was not significantly affected. [3H]Leukotriene metabolites in bile, liver and urine were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The proportion of N-acetyl-[3H]leukotriene E4 relative to polar leukotriene metabolites was higher in the bile of transport mutants as compared to control Wistar rats when analyzed within 30 to 60 min after intravenous injection of [3H]leukotriene C4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Deoxycholic acid and 7-methyl-deoxycholic acid were efficiently absorbed from the intestine, extracted by the liver and excreted into bile as taurine and glycine conjugates. Twenty per cent of deoxycholic acid was 7 alpha-hydroxylated to cholic acid while 7-methyl-deoxycholic acid did not undergo hydroxylation. During deoxycholic acid infusion, the biliary secretion of phospholipid did not increase, and the bile became more lithogenic. In contrast, 7-methyl-deoxycholic acid stimulated phospholipid secretion, and bile became less lithogenic. Although pathologic changes in the liver were inconstant and mostly mild, both bile acids were toxic in the hamster; hemolysis and death due to respiratory distress were observed.\r"

  ".W": "We have utilized ultracentrifugation of native bile-Metrizamide density gradients to isolate a vesicular transport system of biliary lipids in both man and rat. We identified vesicular structures by electron microscopy. Fresh bile specimens were obtained from bile fistula rats (unsaturated bile) and from patients 1 week after bile duct surgery (supersaturated bile). Metrizamide was dissolved in bile (33% w/v), and continuous density gradients were performed with undiluted bile (density limits = 1.020 to 1.300 gm per ml). The relative distribution of biliary cholesterol, phospholipid and bile salt was studied as a function of the density of the fractions. Approximately 50% of total rat biliary cholesterol and between 61 and 90% of human biliary cholesterol was concentrated in the lightest fractions of the gradients (density less than 1.060 gm per ml). In contrast, less than 20% of bile salts was present in fractions with densities lower than 1.060 gm per ml. The highest amounts of bile salts and phospholipids of the bile-Metrizamide density gradients were found in the density range of 1.075 to 1.100 gm per ml in both human and rat bile. More than 80% of biliary proteins was found in fractions with densities greater than 1.075 gm per ml, and only 2% was found in the cholesterol-rich fraction with density less than 1.060 gm per ml in both species. When bile salt concentration was raised in rat bile from 38 to 97 mM by adding taurocholate, the low density cholesterol-rich fraction almost disappeared. Electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations of the fractions with density less than 1.060 gm per ml showed 40 to 120 nm vesicles, which were not apparent in the other fractions. Similar vesicles were demonstrated also in fresh rat bile and within the canaliculi after acute depletion of the bile salt pool (biliary bile salt concentration of 3.45 mM; total biliary lipid concentration of 0.25 gm%). The structure of these vesicles was shown in thin sections of liver specimens. They appeared as internal cavities surrounded by a single, continuous 6-nm-thick bilayer. These studies demonstrate that a high proportion of biliary cholesterol is transported in vesicles in human supersaturated native bile and that vesicular carriers are also responsible for the transport of a significant amount of biliary cholesterol in unsaturated rat bile. The presence of vesicles in unsaturated hepatic bile strongly supports the thesis that biliary lipids may be secreted as vesicles from the hepatocyte into the canaliculi.\r"

However, bile salts are also associated with hemolysis at lower concentrations by mechanisms which have not been characterized. To investigate the possibility that bile salts promote calcium uptake by red blood cells and that bile salt-associated hemolysis is, in part, calcium-mediated, calcium uptake by red blood cells was measured in the presence of individual bile salts, and hemolysis dependence upon calcium availability was examined. Washed human red blood cells with or without ATP depletion were incubated with 1 mM CaCl2 and tracer amounts of 45CaCl2 in the presence of selected bile salts at concentrations (0.01 to 0.3 mM) reported to be below critical micellar concentrations. Calcium uptake (defined for the purposes of this study as 45Ca retained in red blood cells) was monitored over 5 hr, after which hemolysis and membrane phospholipid content were determined. The presence of bile salts stimulated calcium uptake 4- to 25-fold--the magnitude of which was partly related to the lipid solubility of the bile salts. ATP depletion or exposure to trifluoperazine, procedures which inhibit calcium pump activity in red blood cells, enhanced bile salt-induced calcium uptake relative to controls. The percentage of associated hemolysis (2 to 14%) at the end of 5 hr correlated directly with the observed calcium uptake. Removal of calcium from the extracellular space reduced hemolysis in the presence of bile salts to control levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Levels of vitamin A, as retinol and retinol esters, and of cellular retinol-binding protein have been determined in liver samples from 6 normal adults and 11 children with biliary atresia, with and without vitamin A treatment. The level of cellular retinol-binding protein in the liver was not related to the liver vitamin A concentration examined over a 300-fold range of vitamin A levels. Also, biliary atresia did not appear to interfere with storage of vitamin A, and the level of cellular retinol-binding protein was comparable to that observed in the liver of normal adults. The demonstration of proper vitamin A storage in treated children as well as normal levels of cellular retinol-binding protein suggest the vitamin A deficiency frequently observed in children with biliary atresia may be due primarily to faulty absorption rather than a combination of poor absorption and impaired hepatic vitamin A metabolism.\r"

The male and female mice of both strains were fertile at 8 weeks of age, and the male black mice were first susceptible to induction of gallstones at 24 weeks of age. Male agouti mice of the same age did not form gallstones until they had consumed the lithogenic food for 8 weeks. The gallbladder biles of both strains were supersaturated with cholesterol during the lithogenic regimen. The male agouti mice had much higher fractional turnover rates of [24-14C]cholic acid than did the male black mice. In spite of their small total cholate pools, the agouti mice had higher rates of new cholate synthesis than did the black mice. The rate of disappearance of [1,2-3H]cholesterol from the blood was higher in the male agouti than in the black mice. The gallbladders of the agouti mice contained less bile and weighed less empty than gallbladders of the black mice. They also did not increase in volume in response to the lithogenic diet as much as gallbladders of the black mice. The difference in gallstone induction times between male and female black mice was as great as the difference between the two strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87163922\r", 
  ".W": "Evidence was recently presented that an essential part of the accumulation of cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is due to acceleration of a novel pathway, involving 7 alpha-hydroxylated intermediates in bile acid biosynthesis as precursors (J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75:448-456). Such intermediates accumulate in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis due to lack of the mitochondrial 26-hydroxylase involved in the major pathway for bile acid biosynthesis. The new pathway may involve the following steps: 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol----7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one----cholesta-4,6- dien-3-one----4-cholesten-3-one----cholestanol. Accurate methods have been developed for assay of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one in serum, based on isotope dilution-mass spectrometry. The serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one as well as those of cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one were found to be markedly elevated in the three patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Treatment of two of the patients with chenodeoxycholic acid reduced the serum levels of the two steroids by more than 80%. The concentration of cholestanol was reduced by 72% in one patient and by 48% in the other. The possibility is discussed that accumulation of cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is secondary to accumulation of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one.\r"

  ".W": "Rabbit sera injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice were noted to produce a considerable and selective enlargement of extrahepatic bile ducts. The gallbladder, intrahepatic ducts, liver and other organs showed no stimulation of growth. Duct enlargement leading to widening of its outer diameter which, on average, was 3.6 times that of normal, was due entirely to an increased number of epithelial cells with prominent proliferation of intramural glandular components. There was no evidence of inflammatory bile duct injury, fibrosis or obstruction. All of the above changes were reversible and regressed slowly after discontinuation of injections. The bile duct growth-promoting factor was detected in sera of many animal species including humans and birds. Host response to this factor was determined by the number of injections and appeared to be strain-related since it was not observed in C57BL or C3H mice. The sex and age of the donor or recipient were not of any relevance to the growth response. In order to isolate and characterize the bile duct growth factor, rabbit serum was separated into various fractions, and the effect of each fraction was tested in the animal model. Proteins in the 33 to 65% ammonium sulfate precipitate of whole rabbit sera had activity equal to that of native sera. Activity was abolished by treating this serum fraction with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate plus proteinase K, suggesting that the bile duct growth factor is a protein. Lipids extracted from whole sera using chloroform: methanol or ultracentrifugation were devoid of activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hepatitis B virus binds avidly to albumin polymers which in turn may mediate the initial binding of viral particles to the liver cell. However, the interaction of albumin polymers with the liver remains poorly characterized, and the possibility that hepatic binding reflects an artifact of polymerization with glutaraldehyde has not been excluded. We therefore characterized the binding of 125I-labeled natural and synthetic albumin polymers to suspensions of rat hepatocytes. Saturable binding was demonstrated for all preparations of monomeric and polymeric albumin studied. Glutaraldehyde-polymerized albumin (mean polymerization number = 15) bound much more avidly than naturally occurring albumin polymers (mostly dimers and trimers) or monomeric albumin. Competition between monomer and synthetic polymer was not observed. Reduction of free aldehyde groups on the synthetic polymer decreased nonsaturable binding without affecting saturable binding. Autoradiography confirmed binding of polyalbumin to hepatic parenchymal cells. Glutaraldehyde-polymerized ovalbumin, a protein unrelated to serum albumin, also bound hepatocytes saturably. We conclude that hepatic binding of synthetic albumin polymers is not due to residual aldehyde groups on the polymer and is much more avid than for natural polymer. This difference may reflect the higher degree of polymerization or chemical modification of the synthetic polymer. The hepatic binding sites for synthetic polymer appear distinct from those previously described for monomeric albumin and may not be specific for albumin.\r"

Liver histology was normal in 31.4%, revealed nonaggressive liver disease in 63.6% and chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis in 5%, only. All except one case of chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis were associated with abnormal blood biochemical tests. Sequential liver biopsies obtained in 56 HBsAg carriers after a minimal interval of 4 years showed mitigation of inflammatory changes in 5.4% and developing chronic active hepatitis in three cases (5.4%). One carrier died of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Upon follow-up, HBsAg persisted in 98%. Anti-HBe was found in 90% of all carriers already at the initial testing. HBeAg positivity (7.5%) was associated with chronic active hepatitis as well as nonaggressive liver disease; clearance of HBeAg occurred in 40% after 2 to 8 years. Because of the subclinical progression of liver disease and the increased risk for developing primary hepatocellular carcinoma in asymptomatic HBsAg carriers, routine blood testing, including alpha-fetoprotein screening, as well as abdominal ultrasound surveillance are indicated. Liver biopsy, however, should be restricted to carriers with abnormal biochemical findings.\r"

Since the fetal cell itself represents a second barrier to nutrients, one which may be altered by ethanol exposure, the effects of ethanol on amino acid net uptake by rat fetal hepatocytes was addressed. The present study determined that ethanol stimulated amino acid net uptake by fetal hepatocytes grown in monolayer culture. Fetal liver cells were grown in custom Williams' E medium (without L-arginine and with L-ornithine) and exposed to epidermal growth factor (0, 1, 2 or 5 ng per ml) and ethanol (1.7 +/- 0.1 or 3.9 +/- 0.2 mg per ml). Addition of ethanol (3.9 mg per ml) to the culture medium completely blocked measurable cell replication during a 48-hr exposure period. Fetal hepatocytes exposed to ethanol accrued both protein and water in a parallel fashion, both in excess of that by control cells. Ethanol (1.7 and 3.9 mg per ml) for 48 hr stimulated alpha-aminoisobutyric acid net uptake by fetal hepatocytes (p less than 0.05). Efflux was not affected (p greater than 0.05). The onset of this significant stimulation of net uptake was progressive and required in excess of 6 hr of contact with ethanol. This ethanol stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid net uptake persisted for at least 24 hr following ethanol withdrawal. The component(s) of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid net uptake stimulated by ethanol was independent of extracellular Na+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ethanol metabolism on the energetic parameters and intracellular pH of the isolated perfused rat liver from fed rats was studied by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This technique allowed us to analyze nondestructively and in real time the role of low oxygen tension on the possible injurious effect of ethanol on the liver cells. A quantitative analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance data recorded on a perfused rat liver within a 30 mm diameter probe has been performed at 80.9 MHz. Under normoxic and normothermic conditions, the levels of phosphorylated metabolites detected by nuclear magnetic resonance were 2.8, 0.3 and 2 mumoles per gm liver wet weight for ATP, ADP and inorganic orthophosphate, respectively. The cytosolic pH was 7.25 +/- 0.05. During a period of 4 min of hypoxia induced by reducing the perfusion flow rate to 25% of its initial value (i.e., from 12 ml to 3 ml per min per 100 gm body weight), the level of ATP dropped to 2.2 mumoles per gm liver wet weight. Concomitantly, ADP and inorganic orthophosphate increased to 0.6 and 3.3 mumoles per gm liver wet weight. Cytosolic pH fell to 7.02 +/- 0.05. Perfusion of the liver with a Krebs medium containing 70 mM (0.4%) ethanol induced a sharp decrease in intracellular inorganic orthophosphate to reach 1.3 mumole per gm liver wet weight and after a lag time of 4 to 6 min, a decrease in ATP level (2.15 mumoles per gm liver wet weight). A large increase in phosphomonoesters (mainly sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) up to 6 mumoles per gm liver wet weight was also observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The branched-chain amino acids (2.0 mM or 1.0 mM), in the presence or absence of insulin (2 X 10(-4) IU per dish) and in both types of experiments, reduced the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable 35S-protein secreted into the medium. The branched-chain keto acids (2.0 mM or 1.0 mM) had a stimulatory effect on secreted trichloroacetic acid-precipitable 35S-protein which was observed only by the pulse-chase technique in the presence of insulin. Immunoaffinity chromatography of medium demonstrated a slight inhibition by branched-chain amino acids and a slight stimulation by branched-chain keto acids on secretion of 35S-albumin and no effect of either treatment on secretion of 35S-fibrinogen. ELISA analysis of total (i.e., 35S-labeled and unlabeled) secreted albumin revealed an inhibitory effect of the branched-chain amino acids in both pulse-chase and steady-state experiments, and a small stimulatory effect, in steady-state experiments, of the branched-chain keto acids; both effects were insulin-dependent. Total secreted fibrinogen, under steady-state conditions, was increased by the branched-chain keto acids in the presence of insulin, while transferrin production was unaffected by any treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The DNA modal values, which could be defined in 51 cases, ranged from 2.2 to 9.8 ploidy, with 46.3% (25/54) in hypertetraploidy. The hepatocellular carcinomas in patients with higher serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein contained more hyperploid cells. The DNA modal values did not correlate with the age, HBsAg status, tumor size and histological grading of hepatocellular carcinoma. The S-phase fraction values, which could be estimated on the DNA histograms in 43 cases (79.6%), ranged from 1 to 35 (mean +/- S.D. = 10.6 +/- 8.1). The S-phase fraction values were higher in high grade hepatocellular carcinomas (13.4 +/- 8.5) than low grade hepatocellular carcinomas (6.1 +/- 4.4), p less than 0.01. The mean S-phase fraction values were also significantly higher in hepatocellular carcinomas with alpha-fetoprotein levels of more than 100 ng per ml than those of less than 100 ng per ml (12.9 +/- 8.0 and 7.8 +/- 5.6, respectively). The S-phase fraction values also did not correlate with the age, HBsAg status and tumor size.\r"

  ".W": "Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity was detectable in cultured macrophage monolayers of peripheral blood monocyte origin. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from patients with biopsy-confirmed liver disease and healthy volunteers. Macrophage monolayers were prepared and incubated at 37 degrees C. After 24 hr, the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity and cellular protein concentration were assayed on cell homogenates. The monocyte aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in cultured macrophages from normal volunteers was 1.23 +/- 0.16 (n = 19). The aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in macrophage cultures from patients with biopsy-confirmed liver disease was 0.48 +/- 0.05 (n = 20). This represents a significant (61%) decrease in monocyte aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase compared to controls. The 20 patients have established cirrhosis or early stage liver disease. The established cirrhosis group includes alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency-associated cirrhosis; primary biliary cirrhosis; alcoholic (Laennec's) cirrhosis; cryptogenic cirrhosis, and hemochromatosis. Early stage liver disease is attributed to methotrexate (Stage III), early stage primary biliary cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Our results indicate that the depression in monocyte aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity is greater in patients with established cirrhosis than early stage liver disease. Our results further suggest that cultured monocytes from patients with liver disease spontaneously release soluble factors into the culture medium. Incubation of this medium, containing macrophage factors, with isolated hepatocytes significantly depress hepatocyte aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity compared to medium obtained from cultures of monocytes from normal volunteers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The feasibility of measuring caffeine clearance from saliva (SCl) was assessed in ambulatory patients with liver disease and in a control group, and the results were compared with quantitative liver function tests. For this purpose, the subjects were given 280 mg caffeine p.o. in decaffeinated coffee powder between noon and 4 p.m., and caffeine concentrations were measured in saliva (using an enzyme immunoassay) before bedtime and upon arising. In the cirrhotics (n = 29), SCl was 0.58 +/- S.D. 0.45 ml per min X kg, thus being reduced to approximately one-third of drug-free, nonsmoking controls (1.53 +/- 0.46, n = 18); although patients with noncirrhotic liver disease showed intermediate values (0.95 +/- 0.47), their reduction in SCl was significant (p less than 0.001). SCl was correlated with indocyanine green fractional clearance, galactose elimination capacity and aminopyrine breath test; however, the closest relationship (Rs = 0.80) was observed with the aminopyrine breath test. It is suggested that the measurement of SCl represents a noninvasive and innocuous procedure for quantifying hepatic microsomal function, and is suitable for routine use. Since a.m. saliva concentrations of caffeine are highly correlated (Rs = -0.94) with SCl, further simplification of the test to a single-point measurement appears possible.\r"

  ".U": "87163934\r", 
  ".W": "The antiviral drug, acyclovir, has been used in the treatment of chronic type B hepatitis. High serum concentrations of acyclovir are required to achieve inhibition of hepatitis B viral replication. Because only 15 to 20% of an oral dose is absorbed, it is necessary to administer acyclovir by intravenous infusion. 6-Deoxyacyclovir, an analog of acyclovir, is well absorbed when given orally, and is converted to acyclovir by xanthine oxidase which is present in the gut and liver. This study has examined the hepatic disposition of 6-deoxyacyclovir in a 100 ml recirculating (12 ml per min) perfused rat liver system. Following administration of a bolus dose of 5 mumoles 6-deoxyacyclovir to the reservoir, perfusate concentrations of 6-deoxyacyclovir declined monoexponentially, as the metabolite acyclovir appeared in the perfusate. Addition of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol (5 mg) to the perfusate reservoir prior to the administration of 6-deoxyacyclovir resulted in impaired hepatic metabolism of 6-deoxyacyclovir, as demonstrated by a 47% reduction in systemic clearance rate (4.5 +/- 0.4 to 2.4 +/- 0.9 ml per min; p less than 0.05) (mean +/- S.E., n = 6) and a 1.8-fold increase in terminal elimination half-life of 6-deoxyacyclovir (23.5 +/- 2.7 to 42.7 +/- 4.1 min; p less than 0.05), accompanied by a 30% reduction in appearance of acyclovir. The efficient hepatic conversion of 6-deoxyacyclovir to the active antiviral drug, acyclovir, provides a rationale for trials of oral 6-deoxyacyclovir in the treatment of chronic type B hepatitis.\r"

A primary culture of rat hepatocytes was used to evaluate the possible hepatotoxicity of the chlorpromazine photoproducts, keeping in mind the following criteria: leakage of cytosolic enzymes; attachment index to culture plates, and albumin synthesis. Cells exposed to concentrations greater than 10(-4) M of the photomixtures showed extensive leakage of GOT and GPT into the culture medium and, at the same time, the cell attachment was seriously impaired. A concentration of 10(-7) M of the photoproducts proved capable of inhibiting the synthesis of albumin (20%). Photoproducts obtained after aerobic irradiations were as toxic for hepatocytes as those found in anaerobic conditions. The implications of our results in connection with the relevance of oxygen-dependent photoreactions of chlorpromazine to its phototoxicity, and the possible appearance of hepatic alterations in patients treated with the drug after exposure to the sunlight, are discussed.\r"

This study attempted to determine whether the cerebral vasculature of 4- to 5-week-old SHR used existing normal mechanisms to tolerate hypertension or had microvascular characteristics uniquely suited for hypertensive life. At mean arterial pressures above about 60 mm Hg, the arterioles of SHR were constricted compared with similar branch order vessels of normal Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). At arterial pressures below 60 mm Hg, however, the inner diameters of arterioles in normal and hypertensive rats can be similar. At arterial pressures of 40 to 120 mm Hg, normal WKY maintained blood flow within +/- 10 of that at the resting arterial pressure of 90 mm Hg; SHR with a mean arterial pressure of 120 mm Hg regulated blood flow over a pressure range of 60 to 160 mm Hg. Normal WKY had petechial hemorrhages from venules and sustained loss of arteriolar tone at arterial pressures above 120 mm Hg, which is the resting arterial pressure of 4- to 5-week-old SHR. Microvascular pressure measurements indicated that the resistance of cerebral arteries was increased, because they dissipated about 50% of the arterial pressure in SHR compared with about 40% in WKY.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that the vasoconstrictor action of vasopressin may contribute to the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was tested by chronic infusion of a specific antagonist of the vascular effects of vasopressin. From 4 to 13 weeks of age, SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) received subcutaneously either isotonic saline or the vasopressin pressor antagonist, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)arginine vasopressin by osmopump. Systolic blood pressure was measured by tail cuff from 5 to 11 weeks of age. In SHR, the vasopressin analogue did not alter the rate or magnitude of increase in systolic blood pressure. In WKY, systolic blood pressure in the vasopressin analogue group was slightly reduced compared with the saline infusion values until 10 weeks of age (F1, 10 = 10.18, p = 0.008). At 12 to 14 weeks of age, all animals were prepared with indwelling arterial and venous catheters. Resting mean arterial pressure was not altered significantly by the vasopressin analogue infusion in either strain, but the response to an acute vasopressin infusion of 5, 15, or 50 ng/kg body weight was markedly attenuated by the analogue treatment, indicating that plasma levels of the vasopressin analogue were sufficient to block pressor effects of endogenous vasopressin. A bolus injection of the angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide (SQ 20881) resulted in a decrease in mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.05) that was comparable in all groups, and serum renin concentration was not elevated in the vasopressin analogue-treated rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ratio of Ao-1 to Ao-2 was determined by separation of Ao-1 and Ao-2 from 1 ml of plasma from individual rats on an SP-Sephadex C-50 column. Plasma from rats of three different strains, Wistar, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY), and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), was investigated. In Wistar rats native plasma contained Ao-1 and Ao-2 in a ratio of 2.6:1. Twenty-four hours after nephrectomy, which increased the total Ao content 4.1-fold, this ratio was changed to 1.1:1. In native WKY and SHR the ratio of the two forms was similar to that in Wistar rats: 2.4:1 and 2.8:1, respectively. After nephrectomy the ratio of Ao-1 to Ao-2 was changed to 1.1:1 and 0.78:1 in WKY and SHR, respectively, while the total Ao content increased 4.9-fold and 8.2-fold in the two strains. Endogenous plasma renin inactivated the two forms of Ao, with a Km of 4.0 +/- 0.46 and 3.7 +/- 0.43 microM and a Vmax of 176 +/- 15.5 and 155 +/- 12.7 nM/hr, respectively. These results suggest that 1) Ao-1 and Ao-2 are synthesized in equimolar amounts, 2) the clearance of Ao-2 is faster than that of Ao-1 in control rats, and 3) under conditions of stimulated synthesis (i.e., after nephrectomy), the plasma content of Ao-2 increases faster than that of the more highly glycosylated form, Ao-1.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examined the role of the renal nerves in the development of hypertension produced by chronic infusion of angiotensin II in the conscious rat. The animals were divided into four groups, and a unilateral nephrectomy was performed. The remaining kidney was denervated in two groups, whereas in the other two groups of animals the nerves were left intact. Four days later either angiotensin II (83 ng/min) or saline infusions were begun through subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. The rats were subsequently studied for 14 days. The results indicate that renal denervation significantly attenuated the pressor response to angiotensin II for approximately 6 days. Following this period, there was no difference in blood pressure between the innervated and denervated rats infused with angiotensin II, as both groups attained a hypertensive level of 170 to 180 mm Hg, which was 60 to 70 mm Hg above the blood pressure of the control rats infused with saline. Kidney norepinephrine content was reduced 95% by the denervation procedure and by 40% following infusion of angiotensin II into rats with intact renal nerves. These data demonstrate that, while the renal nerves appear to play a modulatory role in the development of the hypertension, they are not essential for the pathogenesis to occur nor do they determine the final level of hypertension achieved following chronic infusion of angiotensin II in the rat.\r"

In agreement with previous studies, pressor responses of area postrema-ablated rats (n = 11) to acute angiotensin II infusion were identical to those of control sham-lesioned rats (n = 13). In these same rats, however, a 5-day infusion of angiotensin II produced a sustained hypertension in the sham-lesioned group whereas mean arterial pressure was increased only transiently (1-3 days) in the area postrema-ablated rats. No differences before infusion of arterial pressure, heart rate, water intake, urinary sodium excretion, and urinary potassium excretion were observed between sham-lesioned and area postrema-ablated rats; only arterial pressure was changed significantly during angiotensin II infusion in either group. Twenty-four hours after terminating angiotensin II infusion, mean arterial pressure was within the normotensive range in both sham-lesioned and area postrema-ablated rats. In a separate group of sham-lesioned (n = 13) and area postrema-ablated (n = 12) rats, angiotensin II was infused intravenously for a 10-day period; mean arterial pressure was increased significantly over the entire 10-day infusion in sham-lesioned rats, but for only 1 day in area postrema-ablated rats. An intact area postrema appears necessary for the development of chronic, but not acute, hypertension during intravenous infusion of angiotensin II in the rat.\r"

Hemodynamics (microspheres) were measured at 8, 24, 48, and 96 weeks of age, and plasma catecholamines were measured at 8 and 96 weeks. At rest, elevated mean arterial pressure was associated with unaltered cardiac index and heart rate in SHR compared with WKY at all ages. Regional blood flow was largely similar in both strains, except for a reduced renal flow in 96-week-old SHR. Cardiac index and most regional blood flow tended to or did decline in both strains between 8 and 96 weeks. Plasma catecholamines were similar in both strains at 8 and 96 weeks. Shaker stress evoked responses similar to defense reactions in both strains. The incremental responses in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac index, and cerebral, skeletal muscle, and myocardial flow and the decremental responses in splanchnic, renal, and skin flow were greater in SHR than in WKY, particularly at 8 weeks. Most of these responses tended to or did decline between 8 and 96 weeks in both strains. The plasma catecholamine responses were also greater in SHR at 8 and 96 weeks, and they did not differ in either strain between these ages. Thus, circulatory and sympathoadrenal reactivity to acute stress were enhanced in SHR compared with WKY, independently of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These increases in vasopressin concentration resulted in no change in arterial pressure and significant changes in the following: a 13 and 29% decrease in resting cardiac output during dehydration and acute infusion, respectively; a 26% reduction in heart rate during acute infusion; a 12 and 54% increase in total peripheral resistance during dehydration and acute infusion; a 16 and 22% reduction in mean circulatory filling pressure during dehydration and chronic vasopressin infusion. In addition, maximum pumping ability of the heart was reduced 16 and 31% during dehydration and acute infusion, respectively. These data suggest that elevations of vasopressin such as those occurring during dehydration or volume depletion potentially may affect cardiovascular performance by three mechanisms: greatly increasing resistance to flow, reducing heart rate, suppressing the pumping ability of the heart.\r"

  ".W": "Because an inherited renal factor may contribute to essential hypertension in humans, the study of family members is attractive. To assess the determinants of renal vascular tone, graded doses of either diltiazem (10-1000 micrograms/min) or acetylcholine (1-100 micrograms/min) were infused into the renal artery in 52 normotensive subjects, 16 with and 36 without a family history of hypertension when they were in balance on either a 10-mEq or 200-mEq sodium intake. Renal blood flow was measured with 133Xe. Restricted sodium intake potentiated renal vascular responses to diltiazem (p less than 0.01), suggesting a role for angiotensin as a determinant. In four subjects with no family history of hypertension on a 200-mEq sodium intake, angiotensin II in subpressor doses (1 ng/kg/min i.v.) induced renal vasoconstriction and enhanced the renal vasodilator action of diltiazem (p less than 0.001). In subjects with a family history of hypertension, the renal vascular response to diltiazem was enhanced (p less than 0.01) despite similar values of plasma renin activity, angiotensin II concentration, and sodium excretion. Because responses to acetylcholine were modified neither by sodium intake nor by family history, specificity for diltiazem was suggested. The intriguing possibility is raised that the enhanced renal vascular response to diltiazem reflects an abnormality in the control of renal vascular tone in the offspring of essential hypertensive subjects.\r"

Customary BP measurements in the seated position were corrected for the height of the arterial column extending from the BP cuff to the top (vertex) of each girl's head. This vertex correction procedure has previously been shown to eliminate the childhood association between mean arterial pressure and age. Vertex-corrected systolic BP was correlated individually (p less than 0.03) with serum fasting glucose, ionized calcium, sodium, and calculated osmolality. The BP association with serum glucose did not persist after an oral sucrose challenge. Vertex-corrected diastolic BP was correlated individually (p less than 0.02) with serum ionized calcium and four indices of obesity, the best correlated of which was the subscapular skinfold (r = 0.66, p = 0.0001). Vertex-corrected BPs generally provided stronger correlations than customary (uncorrected) BPs with the variables of interest. Correlations with seated BPs were generally stronger than those with supine BPs. By multiple regression analysis, seated vertex-corrected systolic BP was related directly to serum fasting glucose and ionized calcium and inversely to pulse rate (R2 = 0.53). Seated vertex-corrected diastolic BP was related directly to subscapular skinfold and calculated osmolality (R2 = 0.54). Vertex correction may facilitate clinical or epidemiological studies of early hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-eight normal subjects and 51 subjects with borderline hypertension underwent microvascular and hemodynamic studies while on an ad libitum diet and during periods of sodium depletion (10 mEq/day) and repletion (200 mEq/day). Hemodynamic measurements included arterial blood pressure, cardiac index, total peripheral resistance, forearm blood flow, vascular resistance, venous compliance, and capillary filtration fraction. Studies of the microcirculation consisted of macrophotography of the bulbar conjunctiva with measurement of anteriolar, venular, and capillary density and diameter. During sodium repletion, cardiac index increased significantly in the normal subjects (2.35 +/- 0.7 vs 2.44 +/- 0.7 L/min/m2; p less than 0.01) and in the borderline hypertensive subjects (2.50 +/- 0.7 vs 2.70 +/- 0.8 L/min/m2; p less than 0.01). However, mean blood pressure rose by more than 5% in only 33 subjects, 13 with normal and 20 with borderline hypertension. When these sodium-sensitive subjects were compared with those whose blood pressure did not rise, the former were found to have significantly higher forearm vascular resistance (32.2 +/- 21 vs 17.9 +/- 12 mm Hg/ml/min/100 g; p less than 0.01), lower forearm blood flow (4.42 +/- 2.7 vs 7.47 +/- 5.0 ml/min/100 g) and lower conjunctival capillary density (3.72 +/- 1.7 vs 5.18 +/- 2.1 [SD] mm/mm2; p less than 0.05). These results indicate that sodium sensitivity in humans is accompanied by elevation of forearm vascular resistance and attenuation of the microcirculation.\r"

Plasma norepinephrine was related to age (r = 0.39, p less than 0.01), correlated closely with mean arterial pressure (MAP; r = 0.54, p less than 0.0002) and systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.49, p less than 0.0005), and was related inversely to cardiac output (r = -0.26, p less than 0.06) and stroke volume (r = -0.31, p less than 0.05). Age correlated weakly with MAP (r = 0.31, p less than 0.05) and more strongly with systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.46, p less than 0.005) but was negatively related to cardiac output (r = -0.41, p less than 0.005) and heart rate (r = -0.33, p less than 0.05). Weight did not correlate with any of the hemodynamic variables. Partial regression techniques yielded significant residual correlations between age-adjusted plasma norepinephrine and MAP (r = 0.42, p less than 0.005) or systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.38, p less than 0.005). Residual correlations with cardiac output (r = -0.34, p less than 0.05), heart rate (r = -0.36, p less than 0.02), and systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.33, p less than 0.05) remained after adjusting age for the corresponding plasma norepinephrine values.

Total intradepurative clearances (diffusive and convective) and solutes extraction of urea, creatinine, uric acid and phosphate were determined. Clearance of small molecular weight solutes was better in BF than in HD especially for uric acid and phosphate. This confirms the high depurative efficiency of the AN 69 S.

At the start of each session, whole blood volume (WBV), PV and red cell volume (RCV) were determined using 5 mu Ci of radioiodinated serum albumin (RISA). PV and Vfm were calculated at hourly intervals using a serial hematocrit method. On Bic. HD, PV increased at 60 min. then decreased at 120 and 180 min., with efficient Vfm only during the first hour. On BF, PV increased throughout treatment, with greater Vfm. It would appear that PV is better preserved in BF, on account of more efficient Vfm.\r"

These two factors may stimulate PTH secretion, with negative long-term effects in dialysis bone disease.\r"

Sixteen uremic patients who showed circulatory instabilities during traditional hemodialysis (HD) were treated with HF (27 liters infused in postdilution), or BF (210 min/session) for 12 months. Low and middle molecular weight metabolites weekly clearances, calcium, phosphorus and bicarbonate serum levels in BF and HF showed no significant differences: in BF the incidence of symptomatic hypotension events and orthostatic changes of mean blood pressure were lower than in HD, but a little higher than in HF. Our results show that BF achieves satisfactory depuration of low and middle molecular weight metabolites in a shorter time than HF and an improvement of autonomic nervous system abnormalities is observed.\r"

The two protocols were compared on the basis of the clinical state, BUN and serum creatinine, acid-base balance, PTH, anemia, and nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Favourable effects were achieved in 55 patients. Four patients left the program because of progressive hyperhydration. BUN and serum creatinine levels showed a moderate, but insignificant increase. PTH, anemia and NCV did not worsen. BF gave better correction of metabolic acidosis in the patients undergoing acetate dialysis.\r"

  ".W": "The Biofilter 3000 S Hospal may combine higher convective clearance rates (Cc) with usual diffusive clearance rates (Cd) (i.e. similar to Cuprophan dialyzers), giving a higher total clearance rate (Ct) of small and middle molecules. Use of the Biofilter has been suggested to shorten dialysis time schedules. This study was carried out in 8 patients on RDT 3 times weekly, by cuprophan filter and acetate dialysis. The patients were shifted to dialysis with 3000 S guided by two principles: to shorten dialysis time by 1 hour per session, and to reinfuse 6 liters of bicarbonate-saline solution (40 mEq/l) per single dialysis. Besides the usual clinical and laboratory controls, in three patients clearance studies were carried out during four different dialysis sessions: Ct, Cc and Cd of urea K+, creatinine, uric acid and phosphate were measured. No change was observed in the main clinical and laboratory parameters after 3-5 months (average 3.9) of treatment with Biofilter 3000 S; in addition, serum alkaline phosphatase concentration decreased progressively. Clearance results, however, indicate that the expected high values of Ct do not occur, because Cd decreases as Cc is increased. A primary goal of research in hemodialysis is to reduce the average time of treatment while ensuring simultaneously \"physiological\" dialysis. A possible approach to this problem is to use dialyzers with highly permeable and biocompatible membranes such as the \"biofilter\" 3000 S Hospal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acetate hemodialysis alone, combined with hemoperfusion, or associated once a week with plasma-perfusion sessions using an activated bauxite cartridge, bicarbonate dialysis either in single pass or in recirculating system (40 L) and biofiltration, were the depurative treatments employed. The treatments with acetate buffer showed a temporary intracellular shift of Pi at the end of the sessions with post-dialytic plasma Pi rebound. This was not evident with bicarbonate buffer and biofiltration where acidosis was corrected better, and similarly during plasma perfusion treatment because blood pH remained unchanged. These findings may explain the better plasma Pi level at the end of our study with these later therapeutic models compared to acetate dialysis alone or combined with hemoperfusion. In these conditions Pi removal is limited by the correction of acidosis which implies acetate metabolism with ATP activation leading to a transient Pi intracellular influx and a subsequent efflux into the extracellular compartment.\r"

We recorded intra- and inter-dialytic symptoms daily, hematological values and acid-base status monthly. Multimodality evoked potentials were recorded after 3 and 9 months. Biochemical values reached a steady state 9 months from the beginning of the study, metabolic acidosis was corrected more efficiently in both groups at the end of dialysis, but only in the adult patients, were pre-dialysis plasma bicarbonates within normal limits. A clear drop in the number of episodes of intradialytic hypotension was noticed in both groups, but the adolescent patients' tolerance for dialysis did not improve. In conclusion our data show that in adult patients with poor tolerance BF offers a dependable alternative to standard hemodialysis, and the length of treatment can be reduced.\r"

An improvement in biochemical and hematological parameters accompanied by better clinical signs was seen in BF as compared to HD and BHD.

Five CRF patients previously in HD and after six months of BF were studied. End-dialysis and pre-dialysis Ox values and dialyzer clearance were obtained. Predialysis Ox values were: 0.44 +/- 0.15 mg/dl in HD and 0.42 +/- 0.09 mg/dl in BF (NS). End-dialysis Ox values were: 0.30 +/- 0.09 mg/dl in HD and 0.22 +/- 0.04 mg/dl in BF (p less than 0.001). Pre and post dialysis values differed by 31% in HD and 47% in BF (p less than 0.001). Ox clearance was 98.8 +/- 10.3 ml/min in HD and 143 +/- 20.5 ml/min in BF. There was a rebound in Ox values at 48 hours (0.41 +/- 0.08 mg/dl in HD and 0.32 +/- 0.12 mg/dl in BF, (NS). These results indicate that Ox is depurated better during BF than during HD.\r"

The presence of acetate could in fact be contraindicated by a number of potential side effects, metabolic, cardiovascular and biological. Hence, starting from the consideration that in standard biofiltration a buffer is already infused directly as bicarbonate, we tried to overcome the potential hazards of the acetate-containing bath simply by using a dialysate without acetate and by increasing the concentration of bicarbonate in the reinfusate. A cumulative clinical experience of 20 months in 4 patients proved the feasibility and safety of the technique and suggests further advantages over standard biofiltration (better control of acid-base equilibrium, better cardiovascular stability.\r"

The purpose of this work was to assess whether bicarbonate dialysis, with infusion of acetate in predilution, using an AN69-S filter, offered some advantage over bicarbonate and acetate dialysis. In a period of 16 months we analysed 11 patients with this method, comparing them with one group of 7 patients in bicarbonate dialysis and another of 11 in acetate dialysis. The following parameters were investigated: acid-basic balance, HCT, weight and the intradialytic symptoms. There was some improvement in both objective and subjective parameters in patients treated by this method compared to patients in the control groups and the results were lasting.\r"

Pulmonary arterial (Ppa) and airway (Paw) pressures were monitored, and left atrial pressure was kept constant during 10 min of constant-flow perfusion. Kf's were then calculated by two methods [Drake and colleagues (KfD), Am. J. Physiol. 234 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 3): H266-H274, 1978; and Goldberg (KfG), Am. J. Physiol. 239 (Heart Circ.

With no LT's (Tyrode's buffer alone), the mean +/- SE Paw was 9.0 +/- 0.7 cmH2O and the Ppa was 14.2 +/- 1.1 cmH2O throughout the 10-min perfusion. The KfD and KfG were 1.239 +/- 0.169 and 1.586 +/- 0.223 ml X min-1 X mmHg-1 X 100 g lung-1, respectively. The mean +/- SE lung wet-to-dry ratio (W/D) after the 20-min hydrostatic stress was 16.7 +/- 1.6. Within 30-45 s of adding 4 micrograms of LTC4 or LTD4, Paw and Ppa both increased and remained elevated throughout the perfusion period. The KfD and KfG were 1.586 +/- 0.223 and 2.071 +/- 0.234 ml X min-1 X mmHg-1 X 100 g lung-1, respectively, and the W/D was 18.1 +/- 1.7 after LTC4 (all P greater than 0.4 compared with Tyrode's buffer alone) and 1.417 +/- 0.200 and 1.851 +/- 0.244 ml X min-1 X mmHg-1 X 100 g lung-1, respectively, with a W/D of 20.5 +/- 1.3 after LTD4 (all P greater than 0.4 compared with Tyrode's buffer alone).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In confluent cells, exposure to 95% O2 for 5 days reduced thymidine kinase activity to 15% of control values; thymidylate synthase activity was unaffected. In preconfluent cells exposed to 95% O2 for 2 days, similar results were obtained, together with evidence for arrest in cell proliferation. Thymidylate synthase activity could therefore not be related to decreased cell proliferation under hyperoxia. [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, thymidine kinase activity, and cell proliferation were all similarly affected under exposure to graded O2 concentration for 2 days. Thymidine kinase appears to be a key enzyme in the modulation of DNA synthesis from thymidine and in its replication in endothelial cells.\r"

Recent experiments using lesioning and metabolic labeling methods have indicated that the caudal ventrolateral medulla may be a key integrative site for the reflex evoked by muscular contraction induced by ventral root stimulation. Therefore, we sought to determine whether cells in this region could be associated with the cardiovascular reflex accompanying muscular contraction through analysis of their discharge characteristics. Eighty cells were characterized as to their response to ventral root stimulus-induced static muscular contraction, intra-arterial capsaicin (selective groups III and IV stimulus), and mechanical probing. The cells' receptive fields were also determined by mechanical probing. The receptive fields were usually large, often including all four limbs and the trunk. Four response patterns were observed to static contractions: a brisk initial discharge followed by a gradual return toward control levels (slowly adapting), a brief onset and cessation response, a brief inhibition followed by a slowly adapting discharge, and inhibition alone. Virtually all cells tested were responsive to capsaicin. Histological analysis verified the position of the recorded cells. It is suggested that the cells most likely to participate in the pressor response to muscular contraction were those cells in the general region of the lateral reticular nucleus which responded with an initial and sustained discharge and the cells that were inhibited in the region of the nucleus ambiguus (possible inhibition of vagal outflow).\r"

We measured ventilatory variables before and after O3 exposure during rest and exercise before and after vagal block. We compared the effects of vagal blockade, exercise, and O3 on the primary determinants of breathing pattern (VT/TI, VT/TE, TI, and TE) in each of three conditions: base line (steady state), during hypercapnia, and after inhalation of 1% histamine. Under base-line conditions, O3 increased respiratory rate and decreased tidal volume (VT) by shortening time of expiration (TE) and time of inspiration (TI) without affecting VT/TI, an indicator of the neural drive to breathing. During progressive hypercapnia, O3 shortened TE and TI by effects both on tonic (nonvolume-related) and on phasic (volume-related) vagal inputs, and only the latter were prevented completely by cooling of the vagus nerves. Histamine-induced tachypnea was increased by O3 and was totally blocked by cooling the vagus nerves. We conclude that O3 shortens the timing of respiration without increasing ventilatory drive, shortens TI and TE through vagal and nonvagal pathways, increases tonic nonvagal and phasic vagal inputs, and stimulates more than one vagal fiber type.\r"

  ".W": "Chest wall distortion is common in infants and is especially visible in preterm infants. It has been suggested that this distortion increases the volume displacement of the diaphragm during inspiration, which may be associated with muscular fatigue and apnea. We studied 10 preterm infants who had no evidence of lung disease, investigating the effect of chest wall distortion on the volume displacement and work of the diaphragm. The volume changes of the respiratory system were partitioned using an inductance plethysmograph. The minute volume displacement and the work of the diaphragm were calculated using the partitioned abdominal volume change and the gastric and esophageal pressures. The paradoxical movement of the chest wall lasted an average of 36% of inspiration. The minute volume displacement of the diaphragm ranged from 72 to 176% of the minute pulmonary ventilation, and diaphragmatic work ranged from 94 to 793% of that performed on the lungs. The amount of chest wall distortion, as reflected by the duration of the paradoxical chest wall movement, the minute volume excursion, or work of the diaphragm, was not related to the mechanical properties of the lungs. This estimated work load may represent a significant expenditure of calories in these infants and may contribute to the development of diaphragmatic fatigue, apnea, and a prolonged need for mechanical ventilation.\r"

We studied the dynamics of the chest wall in 10 preterm infants to describe the interaction of the chest wall volume, as partitioned by the inductance plethysmograph, and the transthoracic and abdominal pressures. There was considerable hysteresis between the chest wall volume and the transthoracic pressure, and it had linear pressure-volume behavior during airway occlusion, late inspiration, and early expiration. The slope of this pressure-volume relationship, or the instantaneous chest wall compliance, averaged 0.89 +/- 0.16 and 0.94 +/- 0.18 ml/cmH2O for the respiratory effort during airway occlusion and early expiration, respectively. The dynamic compliance was considerably greater, averaging 7.8 +/- 2.3 ml/cmH2O. This resistive pressure-volume behavior was not related to the absolute value of or the rate of development of the esophageal or abdominal pressures. This additional degree of freedom of motion of the chest wall suggests that its linkage to the diaphragm is flexible, which provides a braking force for expiration and allows free movement of the diaphragm for breathing movements before birth.\r"

We found that 20 mM TEA depolarized airway smooth muscle cells from a resting membrane potential (Em) of -59 +/- 4 mV (mean +/- SD) to -45 +/- 2 mV and caused spontaneous action potentials (AP's) to develop, which were 33 +/- 2 mV in amplitude. These were totally abolished in 0 Ca2+ solution. DBcAMP (1 mM) suppressed the development of this TEA-induced electrical activity and the phasic contractions electrically coupled to it. DBcAMP had no significant effect on Em in the absence of TEA however. Forskolin (1 microM) produced similar effects. Our findings suggest that Ca2+ is the principal ion responsible for the inward current associated with the TEA-induced AP's in airway smooth muscle, and that adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate may suppress the electrogenesis of this current.\r"

All sections for one state were scanned at the same chest wall configuration as monitored by rib cage and abdominal dimensions, using magnetometers. Sections were scanned at relaxed functional residual capacity and after inspiring approximately 1 liter in such a way that rib cage dimensions increased only slightly. Models of the diaphragm dome in the two states were constructed from the sets of serial sections. Diaphragm length and volume displaced were measured, the zone of apposition of diaphragm to rib cage was mapped, and the line of the diaphragm silhouette in anteroposterior and lateral X-rays identified. Coronal and sagittal sections were constructed. In the inspiration studied, the diaphragm movement displaced 680 ml. Meridian lines in sagittal, coronal, and transverse directions over the right hemidiaphragm dome shortened by 6.7-7.2 cm, but over the left dome by only 4.0-4.3 cm. Lines of X-ray silhouettes were close to meridian lines, and estimates of shortening were similar to those made previously from X-rays. The peculiar saddle shape of the muscle may help the hemidiaphragms to operate independently, the fibers of the saddle acting as an anchor for midline directed fibers of the hemidiaphragm domes. The shape of the diaphragm also has implications for the distribution of transdiaphragmatic pressure and for the kind of distortion of the lower rib cage margin that is seen during inspirations at high lung volume.\r"

  ".W": "The order of recruitment of single-motor units in parasternal intercostal muscles during inspiration was studied in normal human subjects during quiet breathing and voluntary hyperventilation. Electromyograms were recorded from the second and third intercostal spaces by means of bipolar fine wire electrodes. Flow at the mouth, volume, end-expired CO2, and rib cage and abdominal anterior-posterior diameters were monitored. Single-motor units were identified using criteria of amplitude and shape, and the time of first appearance of each unit in each inspiration was noted. Hyperventilation was performed with visual feedback of the display of rib cage and abdomen excursions, keeping the ratio of rib cage to abdominal expansion. Subjects were normocapnic in quiet breathing and developed hypocapnia during hyperventilation. Recruitment order was stable in quiet breathing, but in some cases was altered during voluntary hyperventilation. Some low threshold units that fired early in the breath in quiet breathing fired earlier at the beginning of a period of voluntary hyperventilation but progressively later in the breath as hyperventilation went on, whereas later firing units moved progressively toward the early part of inspiration. This suggests that different groups of motoneurons in the pool supplying parasternal intercostal muscles receive different patterns of synaptic input.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether sweat lactate secretion during exercise [approximately 70% maximum O2 consumption (VO2max), 60 min] differed in active vs. sedentary female subjects. Sweat rate, total sweat lactate secretion, and sweat lactate concentration were monitored in a group of sedentary (VO2max = 41.0 +/- 1.62 ml X kg-1 X min-1) and active (VO2max = 51.2 +/- 3.20 ml X kg-1 X min-1) women. Sweat rate was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater in the active subjects. There was a significant difference between groups in total amount of sweat lactate secreted (P less than 0.05), with the active group secreting less lactate (29.8 +/- 5.03 mmol, mean +/- SE) than the sedentary group (50.2 +/- 6.61 mmol). Concomitant with the lower total sweat lactate secretion in the active subjects was a significantly (P less than 0.05) more dilute sweat lactate concentration (42.6 +/- 14.08 vs. 100.4 +/- 32.37 mM). In these female subjects, sweat lactate concentration was inversely correlated (r = -0.79, P less than 0.01, n = 10) to sweat rate. It is concluded that total sweat lactate loss is significantly less in active than in sedentary women and that the active subjects secrete a greater quantity of lactate dilute sweat.\r"

  ".W": "When moderate exercise begins, O2 uptake (VO2) reaches a steady state within 3 min. However, with heavy exercise, VO2 continues to rise beyond 3 min (VO2 drift). We sought to identify factors contributing to VO2 drift. Ten young subjects performed cycle ergometer tests of 15 min duration for each of four constant work rates, corresponding to 90% of the anaerobic threshold (AT) and 25, 50, and 75% of the difference between maximum VO2 (VO2 max) and AT for that subject. Time courses of VO2, minute ventilation (VE), and rectal temperature were recorded. Blood lactate, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were measured at the end of exercise. Eight weeks of cycle ergometer endurance training improved average VO2 max by 15%. Subjects then performed four tests identical to pretraining studies. For the above AT tests, training reduced VO2 drift substantially; reduction in each of the possible mediators we measured was also demonstrated. The training-induced decrease in VO2 drift was well correlated with decreases in end exercise lactate and less well correlated with the drift in VE seen at above AT work rates. The training-induced reduction in VO2 drift was not significantly correlated with attenuation of rectal temperature rise or decrease in end-exercise level of the catecholamines. Thus the slow rise in VO2 during heavy exercise seems linked to lactate, though a component dictated by the work of breathing cannot be ruled out.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the acute physiological and structural changes after lung irradiation, the effects of whole-lung irradiation were investigated in fourteen sheep. Ten sheep were prepared with vascular and chronic lung lymph catheters, then a week later were given 1,500 rad whole-lung radiation and monitored for 2 days. Four sheep were given the same dose of radiation and were killed 4 h later for structural studies. Lung lymph flow increased at 3 h after radiation (14.6 +/- 2.1 ml/h) to twice the base-line flow rate (7.5 +/- 1.3), with a high lymph-to-plasma protein concentration. Pulmonary arterial pressure increased twofold from base line (18 +/- 1.6 cmH2O) at 2 h after radiation (33 +/- 3.8). Cardiac output and systemic pressure in the aorta did not change after lung radiation. Arterial O2 tension decreased from 85 +/- 3 to 59 +/- 4 Torr at 1 day after radiation. Lymphocyte counts in both blood and lung lymph decreased to a nadir by 4 h and remained low. Thromboxane B2 concentration in lung lymph increased from base line (0.07 +/- 0.03 ng/ml) to peak at 3 h after radiation (8.2 +/- 3.7 ng/ml). The structural studies showed numerous damaged lymphocytes in the peripheral lung and bronchial associated lymphoid tissue. Quantitative analysis of the number of granulocytes in peripheral lung showed no significant change (base line 6.2 +/- 0.8 granulocytes/100 alveoli, 4 h = 10.3 +/- 2.3). The most striking change involved lung airways. The epithelial lining of the majority of airways from intrapulmonary bronchus to respiratory bronchiolus revealed damage with the appearance of intracellular and intercellular cell fragments and granules. This new large animal model of acute radiation lung injury can be used to monitor physiological, biochemical, and morphological changes after lung radiation. It is relevant to the investigation of diffuse oxidant lung injury as well as to radiobiology per se.\r"

To assess the magnitude of this effect and its regional heterogeneity, we studied six excised dog lungs during HFO [frequency (f) 2-32 Hz; tidal volume (VT) 5-80 ml] at transpulmonary pressures (PL) of 6, 10, and 25 cmH2O. We measured mean pressure at the airway opening (Pao), trachea (Ptr), and four alveolar locations (PA) using alveolar capsules. Pao was measured at the oscillator pump, wherein the peak dynamic head was less than 0.2 cmH2O. Since the dynamic head was negligible here, and since these were excised lungs, Pao thus represented true applied transpulmonary pressure. Ptr increasingly underestimated Pao as f and VT increased, with Pao - Ptr approaching 8 cmH2O. PA (averaged over all locations) and Pao were nearly equal at all PL's, f's, and VT's, except at PL of 6, f 32 Hz, and VT 80 ml, where (PA - Pao) was 3 cmH2O. Remarkably, mean pressure in the base exceeded that in the apex increasingly as f and VT increased, the difference approaching 3 cmH2O at high f and VT. We conclude that, although global alveolar overdistension assessed by PA - Pao is small during HFO under these conditions, larger regional heterogeneity in PA's exists that may be a consequence of airway branching angle asymmetry and/or regional flow distribution.\r"

The phrenic arteries and internal mammary arteries were found to anastomose head to head, forming an internal arterial circle around the medial leaflet of the diaphragm tendon. This arterial circle emitted vascular branches that traveled between muscle fibers toward the periphery of the diaphragm. These branches anastomosed with vessels of the intercostal arteries to form costophrenic arcades all along the fibers of the crural and costal diaphragms. The intercostal arteries were anastomosed to one another by small vessels within the muscular diaphragm, thus forming an arterial ring around the insertions of the diaphragm on the ribs. The venous drainage has an anatomic distribution similar to that observed on the arterial side, but with the additional presence of valves that could play a role in directing blood flow.\r"

Neutrophils and eosinophils have been recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained under identical conditions. We investigated the time course of changes in histamine levels in plasma and BALF taken from ragweed-sensitized dogs after aerosol challenge. Changes in the numbers of circulating neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets were also studied. After 3 min, total pulmonary resistance (RL) was maximally increased and systolic blood pressure was maximally decreased. Histamine levels in plasma and BALF were increased and circulating eosinophils and neutrophils were decreased. After 15 min, platelet numbers were reduced. By 90 min, changes in RL, blood pressure, plasma and BALF histamine concentrations, and circulating neutrophils and eosinophils had returned to base-line values, but platelet numbers remained significantly decreased. Sham challenge caused no significant changes in any of these variables. Intravenous administration of histamine in doses large enough to attain plasma levels comparable with those achieved after aerosol antigen challenge resulted in no concomitant rise in BALF histamine levels. We conclude that antigen challenge in sensitized dogs causes increases in BALF and plasma histamine levels and is associated with a reduction in circulating neutrophils, eosinophils, and platelets. It is likely that antigen causes airway mast cells to release mediators that move down a concentration gradient from the airways to the pulmonary circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Esophageal and gastric pressures during singing are measured in four male professional singers performing singing tasks requiring rapid changes of subglottal pressure. Evidence for a consistent use of the diaphragm is found in all subjects. Some subjects punctually activate the diaphragm when there is a need for a rapid decrease of subglottal pressure, such as when singing a falling octave interval, when shifting from a loud to a soft note, to save air during a /p/ explosion, and in performing a trillo involving a repeated switching between glottal adduction and abduction. The first three cases were observed in the beginning of the phrase, presumably over the period that the pressure generated by the passive expiratory recoil forces of the breathing system was higher than the intended subglottal pressure. In addition to this, one subject exhibited a diaphragmatic tonus throughout the entire phrase. The phonatory relevance of a diaphragmatic activity was evaluated in a subsequent experiment. The transdiaphragmatic pressure was displayed on an oscilloscope screen as a visual feedback signal for singers and nonsingers, who performed various phonatory tasks with and without voluntary coactivation of the diaphragm. In most subjects this activity tended to increase the glottal closed/open ratio as well as the amplitude of the glottogram (i.e., the transglottal volume velocity wave-form as determined by inverse filtering). These changes suggest that diaphragmatic coactivation tends to affect phonation. Also, it tended to reduce the formant frequency variability under conditions of changing fundamental frequency suggesting a better stabilization of the vocal tract.\r"

In contrast, conventional mechanical ventilation had poor gas exchange and extensive hyaline membrane formation and we attributed these differences to mechanical barotrauma. However, we completely overlooked the large number of granulocytes in the damaged lung. To investigate this using the same model we have used mechanical ventilation on two groups of rabbits, one with normal granulocytes, the other depleted of granulocytes by pretreatment with nitrogen mustard. The nondepleted rabbits had poor gas exchange, a substantial protein leak into the lung and extensive hyaline membranes. The depleted animals had good gas exchange, a very small protein leak and no hyaline membranes. Repletion of granulocytes from donor rabbits lead to poor gas exchange and hyaline membrane formation. It is concluded that lung lavage causes prompt margination of granulocytes which become activated by the ongoing epithelial barotrauma of conventional ventilation.\r"

End-diastolic volume index (EDVI) fell 17 ml/m2 (-23%, P less than 0.005) and stroke volume index (SVI) fell 15 ml/m2 (-28%, P less than 0.05). Repeat measurements taken 1-2 wk later (n = 17) demonstrated that HR had returned to normal (4 beats/min, P less than 0.05); however, EDVI remained significantly below preflight levels (-11%, P less than 0.005). End-systolic volume index (ESVI) was also still significantly lower (-23%, P less than 0.01). This delayed recovery occurred despite ability of the subjects to fully ambulate and exercise during the postflight period. These results indicate that spaceflight induces significant changes in heart volume affecting left ventricular function. The exact reasons for these specific changes remain unknown and will require additional measurements before, during, and after flight. The prolonged recovery period for the present subject group probably relates to their high level of aerobic conditioning.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of increases in diaphragmatic muscle contractile activity on diaphragm blood flow remains unclear. The present study examined the effect of electrically induced isometric diaphragmatic muscle contractions on diaphragmatic blood flow. Studies were performed on diaphragmatic muscle strips prepared in anesthetized mechanically ventilated dogs. Diaphragmatic contractile activity was quantitated as the tension-time index (TTI) (i.e., the product of tension magnitude and duration). Blood flow to the strip (Qdi) was measured from the volume of the phrenic venous effluent using a drop counter. The separate effects on Qdi of 30-s periods of continuous and rhythmic contractions were examined. Qdi increased with increases in TTI and peaked at a TTI of 20-30% of maximum after which Qdi fell progressively with further increases in TTI. At levels of TTI greater than 30%, the pattern of muscle contraction significantly affected blood flow. Qdi was significantly lower during activity and the postcontraction hyperemia significantly greater at a given TTI when contractions were continuous than when contractions were intermittent. Above a TTI of 30%, Qdi during contraction decreased linearly with increases in duty cycle and curvilinearly with increases in tension. We conclude that during isometric diaphragmatic contractions, diaphragmatic blood flow may become mechanically impeded, and the magnitude of the impediment in blood flow depends on the pattern of diaphragmatic contractions. With increases in contractile activity above a critical level, changes in duty cycle exert progressively greater effects on diaphragmatic blood flow than changes in muscle tension.\r"

Studies were performed on normal subjects in whom the magnitude of airway pressure developed (Pm) and the duty cycle of breathing (TI/TT) were constrained to achieve a pressure-time integral (i.e., Pm/Pmax X TI/TT) 24% of maximum. In separate trials, the same pressure-time index (24%) was achieved using two widely different patterns of pressure magnitude and duty cycle to allow the effects of changes in the pattern of inspiratory muscle contraction on sensation and fatigue to be assessed. The intensity of the sense of effort was assessed using a category (Borg) scale. The severity of inspiratory muscle fatigue was assessed both from changes in the centroid frequency of the diaphragm electromyogram and from changes in the maximum static inspiratory pressure. Loaded breathing produced inspiratory muscle fatigue and a progressive increase in the sense of effort over time in all subjects. The rate at which the inspiratory muscles fatigued was the same with the two patterns of loading. In contrast, the rate of growth in the intensity of the sense of effort varied significantly as a function of the pattern of loaded breathing. The sense of effort increased at a faster rate with the high pressure-short duty cycle pattern of contraction as compared with the low pressure-long duty cycle pattern. As a result, the intensity of the sense of effort was not uniquely related to the severity of inspiratory muscle fatigue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Questions remain regarding its validity at lung volumes higher and lower than normally observed in upright and horizontal postures, respectively. We therefore evaluated it further in 10 normal subjects, seated and supine, by measuring the ratio of esophageal to mouth pressure changes (delta Pes/delta Pm) during Mueller, Valsalva, and occlusion test maneuvers at FRC, 20, 40, 60, and 80% VC with the balloon placed 5, 10, and 15 cm above the cardia. In general, delta Pes/delta Pm was highest at the 5-cm level, during Mueller maneuvers and occlusion tests, regardless of posture or lung volume (mean range 1.00-1.08). At 10 and 15 cm, there was a progressive increase in delta Pes/delta Pm with volume (from 0.85 to 1.14). During Valsalva maneuvers, delta Pes/delta Pm also tended to increase with volume while supine (range 0.91-1.04), but was not volume-dependent while seated. Qualitatively, observed delta Pes/delta Pm fit predicted corresponding values (based on lung and upper airway compliances). Quantitatively there were discrepancies probably due to lack of measurement of esophageal elastance and to inhomogeneities in delta Ppl. At every lung volume in both postures, there was at least one esophageal site where delta Pes/delta Pm was within 10% of unity.\r"

Maximal inspiratory pressure-flow curves of the respiratory system are analogous to the force-velocity curves for isolated muscle (Agostoni and Fenn, J. Appl. Physiol. 15:349-353, 1960). We measured esophageal pressure (Pes) and plethysmographic flow (V) at relaxation volume of the respiratory system in six trained subjects inspiring maximally through graded resistors (miometric), against a closed airway (isometric), and while constant expiratory flows were forced by a reduced pressure source at the airway opening (pliometric). Pes varied inversely with V and this trend continued into the pliometric range. In addition we found that the pressure-flow characteristics of the rib cage and of the abdomen are similar to those for the chest wall as a whole. The mechanical and energetic advantages of muscle activity under pliometric conditions may be available to some inspiratory muscles in both normal and pathological situations.\r"

Heart perfusions were performed 10 wk later. The five groups studied were: control (C), normotensive swimmers (Sw), sedentary hypertensives (H), swimming rats made hypertensive and then allowed to be sedentary (Sw-H-Sd); and swimming animals made hypertensive and continued in a swimming program (Sw-H-Sw). Total heart and left ventricular weights were increased in increasing degrees in the sequence Sw, H, Sw-H-Sd, and Sw-H-Sw. Right ventricular weight was only increased in Sw and Sw-H-Sw. Swimming before the onset of hypertension enhanced total cardiac output and stroke work. Ejection fractions and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (Vcf) were increased in Sw-H-Sd or Sw-H-Sw vs. controls. Myocardial O2 extraction was increased and coronary flow and myocardial O2 consumption were diminished in all hypertensive groups. However, lactate production was similar in all groups. Myosin adenosinetriphosphatase activity was increased in Sw but decreased in the three H groups. The percent of V1 myosin isozyme was greater and the percent of V3 less in Sw than in C; V1 was diminished and V3 increased in H and Sw-H-Sd; isozymes were normal in Sw-H-Sw.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The volume of liquid in the fetal lungs depends on the rate of liquid secretion (Vs) across the pulmonary epithelium and the rate of flow out of the trachea (Vtr). We measured Vs, by an isotope-dilution technique, and Vtr, with a bubble flowmeter, during low-voltage (LV) and high-voltage (HV) electrocortical activity. In nine chronically instrumented fetal lambs, Vtr was greater during the transition to and at LV (16.98 +/- 1.98 ml/h, mean +/- SE, n = 23) than values during the transition to and at HV (8.69 +/- 0.8 ml/h). A pronounced peak in Vtr of 22.3 +/- 1.8 ml/h (n = 197) occurred at the transition to LV and early in the LV state. Ten minutes or more into LV, Vtr had declined to 10.3 +/- 1.8 ml/h (n = 235). Vtr remained low throughout the HV state. Vs values were not significantly different throughout the LV (11.83 +/- 1.34 ml/h, n = 216) and the HV (13.61 +/- 2.34 ml/h, n = 174) states. Diaphragmatic burst rate during LV (146.9 +/- 6.7 bursts/5 min, n = 432) was greater than during HV (26.5 +/- 4.6 bursts/5 min, n = 348), but burst rate was not correlated with Vtr. In summary, Vtr reaches a peak during the early part of LV when breathing commences and Vs remains constant throughout the behavioral cycle. As a result, lung liquid volume increases slightly during HV and decreases by a similar amount in the early part of LV.\r"

  ".W": "Dog left upper lobes (LUL) were perfused in situ via the left lower lobe artery. Lobe weight was continuously monitored. Increasing lobar flow from normal to 10 times normal had little effect on left atrial pressure, which ranged from 1 to 5 mmHg. There was a flow threshold (Qth) below which lobar weight was stable. Qth ranged from 1.1 to 1.55 l/min (mean 1.27) corresponding to four times normal LUL blood flow. Above Qth, step increases in lobar flow resulted in progressive weight gain at a constant rate that was proportional to flow. The effective pressure at the filtration site (EFP) at different flow rates was estimated from the static vascular pressure that resulted in the same rate of weight gain. From this value and from mean pulmonary arterial (PA) and left atrial (LA) pressures, we calculated resistance upstream (Rus) and downstream (Rds) from filtration site. At Qth, Rds accounted for 60% of total resistance. This fraction increased progressively with flow, reaching 83% at Q of 10 times normal. We conclude that during high pulmonary blood flow EFP is closer to PA pressure than it is to LA pressure, and that this becomes progressively more so as a function of flow. As a result, the lung accumulates water at flow rates in excess of four times normal despite a normal left atrial pressure.\r"
