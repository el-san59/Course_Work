Changes in speeds and densities of retrograde fast organelle transport in rat sciatic nerve preparations were measured in vitro upon exposure to 15 and 50 Hz pulsed magnetic fields with peak intensities of 4.4 and 8.8 mT. Maximum current density of the induced eddy current was calculated to be about 40 microA/cm2. Video enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy was used to record axons supporting active organelle transport. Strong effects were observed in myelinated axons (cessation of transport in up to 10 min). Such effects may eventually be used as part of a neuroprosthesis to noninvasively modify or couple to various parts of the nervous system.\r"

Five were permanent and 111 were temporary implants (3 patients received second implants). Eight different types of TAHs have been used. The ages ranged from 15 to 62 (mean age: permanent 57, temporary 42). Sixty-seven percent (72/108) of patients receiving the TAH for temporary support were transplanted; 6 patients were waiting for a transplant. Forty-seven percent (34/72) were alive after transplantation. Of the 92 patients receiving the Jarvik TAH (the most frequently used device) as a temporary device, 67% (62/92) were transplanted (6 currently supported) and 55% were alive after transplantation; 85% were back to work, with a normal life-style. The thromboembolic rate for patients who received the device as a temporary support was 10%, with 3 patients having residual sequellae. No deaths resulted from mechanical failure. Experience to date suggests that the use of the TAH as a temporary device can be beneficial if patients are carefully selected.\r"

Membrane blood plasma separators of conventional design work poorly at low rates of blood flow, and performance decreases rapidly as the membrane becomes fouled. To overcome these problems, membrane separators have been developed that employ vortex mixing to prevent blood cells obstructing the membrane pores. These separators consist of a single blood channel 160 mm long by 62.5 mm wide. The two membranes that act as boundaries for the blood channel are thermoformed to provide a closely packed array of outward facing dimples. The membranes are seated on rigid support plates, and flexible diaphragms are attached to each end of the blood channel. The diaphragms were oscillated in antiphase at 3 to 6 Hz, with a stroke volume of 2.8 ml. In 24 clinical trials, mean plasma filtration rate was 18 ml/min at a blood inlet flow of 48 ml/min. In 10 experiments using bovine blood, mean plasma filtration rate was 35 ml/min at a blood inlet flow of 90 ml/min. Little reduction in performance was observed over 80 min. The membrane area was 200 sq cm, which gave a filtration velocity of 1.75 L/min/m2, higher by a factor of five than is reported for hollow fiber or flat plate designs.\r"

Eight patients had the diagnosis of benign intractable ascites and two malignant ascites. In two hypercoagulable patients re-exploration of the intravascular limbs was necessary for fibrin plugging, but in no case have we seen catheter tip blood clot thrombosis. One shunt failed to work properly because of adhesions. At present, six of these patients are alive with a functioning shunt and four have died of nonshunt-related complications. The longest period of continuous function with a Minnesota shunt was 100 weeks. Data from this trial are compared retrospectively with data from patients who received LeVeen (n = 8) or Denver shunts (n = 7) at the University of Minnesota Hospitals during the same time period. Performance of the Minnesota shunt was comparable to the commercially available LeVeen and Denver shunts in most respects and appeared to offer advantages in longer functional life and reduction of intensive care unit admissions.\r"

Clinical dialyzers were constructed using two experimental membrane materials: modified cellulose-low (MC-low) and MC-high; standard unsubstituted cellulose was used as a control. Six patients were treated for a period of 3 weeks with each type of dialyzer and a heparin dose of less than 6000 IU/treatment. MC-low exhibited less extracorporeal beta-thromboglobulin and thromboxane B2 release than MC-high or Cuprophan. In addition, residual blood volume after clinical use was lower in the MC-low type. MC-low and MC-high induced less complement activation than Cuprophan, as characterized by extracorporeal C5a and C3a plasma concentrations (75% less C5a generation and 50 to 70% less C3a generation than unsubstituted cellulose).\r"

The frequency distribution of 300 healthy adults with various numbers of F cells consisted statistically of two different groups, low and high F-cell groups. Individuals with greater than or equal to 4.4% of F cells (HbF about 0.7%) were defined as the high F-cell trait, which accounted for 11.3% of males and 20.7% of females. Family studies of 21 probands with this trait and sex-different frequency analyses in the population and probands revealed X-linked dominant inheritance. Two other families of the trait associated with color blindness were described, although no definitive evidence for linkage was obtained between the two. A review of population and family studies reported in the literature indicated that persons with Swiss-type hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) are of the same kind as this trait in their incidence and inheritance form, but represent a portion of the trait with higher levels of HbF or F cells. The existence of X chromosome-localized regulatory gene(s) for the developmental switch of human Hb production is discussed.\r"

Patients were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of treatment by three criteria: transfusion independence, clinical improvement, and blood counts. Group I consisted of 77 patients with acute severe aplastic anemia, randomized to receive either ten or 28 days of ATG. There was no significant difference between the two arms of this protocol: 47% of all patients were clinically improved and 31% were transfusion independent at 3 months. Of the severely affected patients, 27% died before 3 months; most deaths occurred early in treatment. Factors associated with survival in severely affected patients included male sex, age less than 40 years, absolute neutrophil count greater than 200/microL, and idiopathic etiology. Neutrophil counts generally increased by 8 weeks after treatment, but patients continued to show improvement to 1 year posttreatment. In Group II, 44 patients with moderate or chronic severe aplastic anemia were randomized to receive either ten days of ATG or 3 months of high-dose nandrolone decanoate. No patient initially treated with androgens recovered, but 28% of ATG-treated cases achieved transfusion independence at 3 months. Group III consisted of patients with a variety of bone marrow failure syndromes. Patients with pancytopenia and cellular bone marrow showed response rates similar to those of patients with chronic or moderate aplastic anemia.\r"

The 67 boys and 34 girls with T-ALL were 1 month to 18 years old (median, 8 years) with leukocyte counts ranging from 2 to 810 x 10(9)/L (median, 55 x 10(9)/L). Eighteen of these patients were black, and 70 had a mediastinal mass. Twenty-six boys and five girls with a median age of 9 years (range, 1 to 20 years) had T-NHL. Seven of these patients were black, and 24 had a mediastinal mass. The distributions of thymocyte developmental stages (early [CD7+], intermediate [CD1+ and/or CD4+ and/or CD8+], and mature [CD3+]) in cases of T-ALL and T-NHL were significantly different: 34%, 43%, and 23% v 6%, 62%, and 32% (P = .02). A comparison of the patients' clinical features according to the maturational stage of thymocytes failed to disclose significant differences in the majority of characteristics studied. However, patients with mature-stage T-NHL, with or without the addition of subjects with mature-stage T-ALL, were less likely to have a mediastinal mass (P = .02 for both comparisons). Those with intermediate-stage T-cell malignancy (T-ALL and T-NHL combined) were the subgroup most likely to have a mediastinal mass (P = .01). Response to remission induction therapy was significantly worse in the T-ALL subgroup with an early-stage phenotype: a failure rate of 21% v 0% and 6% for the two more differentiated phenotypic subgroups (P = .007). Event-free survival was not affected by thymocyte maturational stage in cases of either T-ALL or T-NHL. Despite evidence of clinical heterogeneity among the maturational stages of T-cell malignancies in children, these developmental subdivisions do not appear to be critical determinants of outcome once remission is achieved. We conclude that such phenotypes need not be included in the stratification plans for clinical trials using common induction treatment.\r"

Extreme elevations of hexokinase, aldolase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, and adenosine deaminase concentrations were noted. In most cases, electrophoretically distinct bands of enzyme activity were also seen. These findings partly explain the previously noted 50- to 100-fold increase in glucose consumption of infected red cells and suggest that further knowledge of these parasite enzymes and their genetic basis may aid both in designing new chemotherapy and in understanding the evolution of these parasites.\r"

When using a fragment of the cDNA that encompassed the coding region of the gene, two restriction fragment length polymorphisms segregating with protein 4.1 deficiency were found in one kindred when using the enzymes BgIII and PvuII but were not seen in the other HE(4.1+) subjects or in 20 random control individuals. DNA digested with three other enzymes (HindIII, EcoRI, TaqI) produced restriction patterns similar to controls. The unique BgIII and PvuII polymorphisms probably reflect a rearrangement of the coding region of the protein 4.1 gene as the underlying cause of the partial protein 4.1 deficiency in this family. A less likely possibility is that these polymorphisms represent coincidental single base changes unrelated to the primary gene defect.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular requirements for iron during DNA synthesis are related to the increased activity of the iron-containing M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme responsible for the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. We have previously shown that transferrin-gallium (Tf-Ga) inhibits cellular iron incorporation. In the present study, Tf-Ga-induced inhibition of HL60 cell growth and upregulation of Tf receptor density was reversed with hemin. Cells exposed to 2 mumol/L Tf-Ga for six hours or longer displayed a diminution in the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy signal of the tyrosyl radical of the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. The effect of Tf-Ga on the ESR signal was reversed by hemin. Tf-Ga decreased the incorporation of 14C-adenosine into DNA and decreased intracellular deoxyribonucleotide pools, with the maximum diminution seen in deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) pools. Exposure of cells to combinations of Tf-Ga and hydroxyurea (a known inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase) resulted in a marked inhibition of cell growth that was consistent with drug synergy. Our studies suggest that Tf-Ga inhibits DNA synthesis through action on the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and that combinations of Ga and hydroxyurea should be further evaluated in in vivo tumor models.\r"

  ".W": "Results of HLA-identical allogeneic marrow transplantation were analyzed for 66 patients with accelerated-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Multivariate proportional hazards regression models were used to determine disease-related and transplant-related factors associated with posttransplant mortality and relapse. The projected 5-year survival rate was estimated at 18% by the product-limit method. The major causes of death were interstitial pneumonia, infection, and relapse. Splenomegaly at initial diagnosis and longer time interval from diagnosis to transplant were associated with decreased overall survival and event-free survival. Sixteen patients have relapsed between 17 and 1,569 days (median, 486) posttransplant. The use of T-cell-depleted marrow and older age of the donor or recipient were associated with an increased probability of leukemic relapse. Ten of the 16 relapses occurred among the 15 patients who received T-cell-depleted marrow. The actuarial relapse risk 2.5 years posttransplant was 100% in patients administered T-cell-depleted marrow as compared with 25% in patients administered unmodified marrow. The data in this report emphasize the increased risks and relatively poor results that occur when marrow transplantation is deferred until after signs of acceleration appear. When compared with results for patients who received transplants during chronic phase, the poor results seen here in patients administered unmodified marrow stem primarily from increased transplant-related mortality rather than increased relapse risk. The strikingly increased relapse rate associated with the use of T-cell depletion would discourage its use for graft-v-host disease prevention in patients who receive transplants for CML.\r"

Similar studies were performed on 16 of the donors. To analyze the results further, recipients were paired with their respective donors. There was no evidence of shifts in cell populations contributing to the X chromosome inactivation patterns in recipient marrow grafts when compared with their respective donors. A mathematical model based on binomial statistics was adapted to estimate the numbers of reconstituting pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. There was no evidence of clonal dominance suggestive of oligoclonal reconstitution in marrow grafts after allogeneic marrow transplantation. This does not preclude the possibility of oligoclonal reconstitution in other marrow transplant settings such as autologous transplantation.\r"

The use of activated charcoal for adsorbing intestinal gas has been effective in healthy subjects but has not been properly investigated in patients with gas complaints.

However, the distribution of the calcium concentrations in these electron-dense structures was bimodal, suggesting that they are composed of at least two subpopulations. One subpopulation had relatively high calcium (up to 53 mmol/kg dry wt) content with a mean value of 12.5 +/- 1.1 mmol/kg dry wt, while the other one had a relatively low calcium content with a mean value of 2.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg dry wt. The mean calcium concentration in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (j-SR) in rat papillary muscle with calcium concentrations larger than 6 mmol/kg dry wt was 14.6 +/- 2.0 mmol/kg dry wt. We propose that the electron-dense structures described above correspond to nonjunctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and that the population containing relatively high calcium concentrations is calsequestrin-containing corbular sarcoplasmic reticulum (c-SR) confined to the I band region, while the population containing relatively low calcium concentrations corresponds to anastomosing regions of the network sarcoplasmic reticulum that lack calsequestrin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Whether these treatments would be effective during extended periods of reperfusion has not been ascertained. Open-chest anesthetized dogs were subjected to left circumflex artery (LCX) occlusion for 90 minutes followed by 72 hours of reperfusion. Dogs were randomized into one of four groups: 1) control; 2) Ilo-2 (iloprost 100 ng/kg/min administered via the left atrium beginning 10 minutes after LCX occlusion and continuing 2 hours into reperfusion); 3) Ilo-48 (iloprost 100 ng/kg/min administered as above until 1 hour after reperfusion then 25 ng/kg/min for 48 hours of reperfusion; or 4) antibody (neutrophil antibody administered before occlusion and 1/2 hourly for 2 hours of reperfusion and then every 24 hours). Myocardial infarct size, as a percentage of the area at risk assessed after 72 hours of reperfusion, was significantly smaller in the antibody-treated group (32.1 +/- 5.0% mean +/- SEM) or Ilo-48 (22.6 +/- 4.0%) treatment group compared with control (48.7 +/- 5.6%) or Ilo-2 (57.6 +/- 5.2%) groups. Regional myocardial blood flow studies demonstrated that all groups developed similar degrees of ischemia. The iloprost-treated groups had lower mean arterial blood pressures during occlusion and reperfusion than groups 1 and 4 (p less than 0.05).

The total body clearance of cyclophosphamide was observed to increase from 93 +/- 27 ml/min on the first day to 178 +/- 83 ml/min on the second day. This was associated with an increase in the clearance of dexamethasone from 369 +/- 104 ml/min to 526 +/- 123 ml/min. An increased rate of formation of phosphoramide mustard with higher peak concentrations was also seen. Simulation studies show that these changes are most likely the result of an increase in the hepatic metabolism of cyclophosphamide. These results show that high-dose cyclophosphamide causes an increase in its own clearance and that of dexamethasone through an apparent induction of hepatic-metabolizing enzymes detectable 24 hours after initial exposure to cyclophosphamide.\r"

Cyclosporine was analyzed from whole blood samples by HPLC. Despite peak drug concentrations of 1463 +/- 754 ng/ml during the infusion period, no adverse pulmonary effects were noted; renal function, urine output, and mean arterial pressure also appeared to have been unaffected. The mean trough cyclosporine concentration was 141 +/- 50 ng/ml; however, two patients had trough values below sensitivity. Kinetic analysis after the third dose of intravenous cyclosporine revealed a mean total body clearance of 0.31 +/- 0.1 L/min and a volume of distribution of 2.88 +/- 1.1 L/kg, whereas the elimination half-life was 12.8 +/- 3.8 hours and the mean residence time was 9.5 +/- 5.1 hours. After conversion to oral therapy the bioavailability ranged from 0.11 to 0.47, with a mean value of 0.27. Subsequently there was an unpredictable pattern of bioavailability within patients, with mean values of 0.27 +/- 0.13 and 0.30 +/- 0.25 during the second and third oral study periods, respectively. These data suggest that despite adjusting the intravenous cyclosporine dosage to account for acute changes in patient body weight, variable kinetics may result in subtherapeutic trough values, even when cyclosporine is administered by prolonged infusion. The clinical implications of fluctuating cyclosporine bioavailability and a potential alternative approach to dosing are discussed.\r"

Nine patients were admitted to the hospital, placed on a diet containing 150 mEq sodium, and studied for periods of 4 hours, on different days, in the following conditions: (1) supine position, (2) upright posture (UP), (3) UP after 10 mg domperidone, intravenously in bolus, and (4) UP after 3 days of domperidone, 30 mg orally. Before domperidone the mean blood pressure observed in supine position of 132 +/- 37/75 +/- 6 mm Hg fell to 75 +/- 22/57 +/- 13 mm Hg after 2 hours in UP. Acute domperidone did not change the blood pressure response to UP. After 3 days of oral domperidone and in UP for 2 hours, the mean blood pressure value of 89 +/- 21/61 +/- 8 mm Hg was higher than that before domperidone (p less than 0.05), with relief of symptoms in all patients. This blood pressure response to UP has been maintained in six patients who completed 6 months of therapy. No differences were observed in plasma renin activity, aldosterone, sodium, and potassium and in 4-hour urinary excretion of aldosterone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, determined during the UP tests. Administration of domperidone for 3 days reduced the falls in creatinine clearance and the urinary excretion of sodium and potassium induced by UP but did not alter the blood pressure and aldosterone dose-response curves to angiotensin II. Although the mechanism of action is not defined, it is concluded that domperidone is effective for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension in patients with diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "1. Somatostatin analogues, such as SMS 201-995 (sandostatin), have been suggested as treatment for a variety of disease states including acromegaly, secretory gastrointestinal tumours and diabetes mellitus. 2. Somatostatin-14 has actions to prolong gastro-intestinal transit time and inhibit intestinal absorption, and we have therefore studied the effects of SMS 201-995 on these processes. Five male subjects received a test meal having been given either saline or 50 micrograms of SMS 201-995 subcutaneously 30 min before ingestion. 3. SMS 201-995 caused a delay in mouth-to-caecum transit time for lactulose assessed by breath hydrogen analysis (316 +/- 17 vs 192 +/- 14 min, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01), a delay (234 vs 120 min, P less than 0.05) in the plasma peak of the non-metabolizable glucose analogue 3-O-methylglucose and conversion of the expected postprandial rise in serum triglycerides (with saline 1.02 +/- 0.20 to 1.51 +/- 0.28 mmol/l, P less than 0.05) to a decrease below basal values (with SMS 201-995 0.97 +/- 0.80 to 0.79 +/- 0.11 mmol/l, P less than 0.05). 4. After SMS 201-995, an enhancement of the increase in blood glucose (8.2 +/- 0.7 vs 4.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, P less than 0.01) and inhibition and postponement of the postprandial rise in insulin (27.6 +/- 6.7 vs 9.9 +/- 2.1 m-units/l, P less than 0.05) occurred.

Five subjects received 50 g of glucose orally while taking either acetate (15 mmol every 15 min) by mouth or chloride as control. Oral acetate made no detectable difference to glucose tolerance or to levels of free fatty acids, 3-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, insulin, glucagon and gastric inhibitory polypeptide. 3. The 50 g dose of glucose temporarily depressed acetate levels in blood. This was probably due to an interaction between glucose and acetate in the gastrointestinal lumen as the same effect was seen with 50 g of xylose in three subjects. 4. Plasma acetate concentrations were unaffected by 50 g of oral glucose in one subject when acetate was instilled into the sigmoid colon. 5. It is unlikely that the improvement of glucose tolerance by dietary fibre is mediated by acetate.\r"

Because disturbances of calcium metabolism have been described in hypertension, measurements of plasma and serum concentrations of ionized calcium, total calcium, magnesium and renin were made in 38 patients with essential hypertension and age- and sex-matched control subjects.

The mean serum concentration of ionized calcium was 1.23 +/- 0.04 (SD) mmol/l in the hypertensive group and 1.21 +/- 0.03 mmol/l in controls, and results were similar after correction for pH. There was a weak positive correlation between serum ionized calcium (pH 7.4) and systolic pressure (r = 0.26, P less than 0.02), but no correlation with plasma renin concentration. 3. Although the difference between serum total calcium concentration in the hypertensive (2.29 +/- 0.09 mmol/l) and control (2.26 +/- 0.07 mmol/l) subjects was not significant, there was a significant correlation between total calcium and systolic pressure (r = 0.23, P less than 0.05) which was maintained after correction for other variables. 4.

The effects of intravenous metoclopramide on baseline values and dopamine dose-response curves for renal haemodynamics and natriuresis were investigated in healthy volunteers and patients with renal disease. 2. Dopamine infusion alone, in doses ranging from 0.25 to 8 micrograms min-1 kg-1, resulted in a dose-dependent increase in effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with a fall in filtration fraction (FF) in eight hydrated healthy volunteers and, to a lesser degree, in 12 patients with renal disease. An increase in natriuresis (urinary excretion of sodium, UNa+V), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa+) and diuresis (urine flow rate, UV) was found in both groups for doses of 2 micrograms min-1 kg-1 and higher. 3. Metoclopramide infusion did not alter baseline values of GFR, ERPF or FF, but shifted the dopamine dose-response curve for ERPF and FF in the healthy volunteers. Metoclopramide induced a fall in UNa+V and FENa+ in both groups (fall in baseline FENa+ from 1.52 to 0.71 during metoclopramide in healthy volunteers and from 1.23 to 0.56 in patients; P less than 0.01) and blunted the natriuretic response to subsequent dopamine infusion. The fall in UNa+V during metoclopramide infusion showed a strong correlation with baseline GFR (r = -0.944). In the patients, the response for the fractional excretions of beta 2-microglobulin and gamma-glutamyltransferase was comparable with that of FENa+. 4. Dopamine infusion induced a fall, and metoclopramide led to rise, in plasma aldosterone concentration. 5.

Patients received either domperidone or placebo orally (20 mg before meals and at bedtime) for six weeks. Symptoms were assessed by daily diaries kept by the patients for two weeks while receiving no medication for their gastrointestinal complaints (baseline), and throughout the six-week treatment phase. Studies of gastric emptying of a radiolabeled solid-phase meal were performed at baseline and six weeks after treatment. All patients had delayed gastric emptying at baseline, defined as a half-emptying time of more than mean + 1 SD (from studies of normal controls). An 18- to 24-hr recording of gastroduodenal motor function during fasting was also performed at baseline and after six weeks of either domperidone or placebo treatment. After six weeks of treatment, the symptom scores significantly improved in the domperidone group (P less than 0.05), but not in the placebo group. Gastroduodenal motor activity was unchanged from baseline recordings after six weeks. Solid-phase gastric emptying also showed no improvement in either the domperidone or placebo group of patients. Although domperidone therapy had no significant effect on motility, it appears to be an effective drug for the treatment of the symptoms of nonulcer dyspepsia.\r"

The mean interval between antral contractions (cycle times), and the frequency of occurrence of related proximal duodenal contractions were similar with all four meals (F = 0.3, for both). Forward (gastroduodenal) flow through the pylorus was observed in 95% of cycles and occurred as up to four brief episodes per cycle, each lasting 2-3 sec. The duration of these episodes with pH 2.8 and pH 7.0 meals was longer than with protein and glucose meals (P less than 0.05). There were, however, fewer episodes of forward flow in each cycle with the pH 2.8 and pH 7.0 meals with the protein and glucose meals (P less than 0.05). Retrograde (duodenogastric) flow was observed in 56% of cycles and occurred, on average, as less than one brief episode lasting about 2 sec each cycle. The pattern of retrograde flow was similar with all meals. Gastric emptying and duodenogastric fluid movement both occur in intermittent brief episodes lasting a few seconds only. Changes in the nature of the test meal cause subtle alterations in the basic pattern of transpyloric fluid movement, presumably reflecting the influence of the meal on control mechanisms governing gastric emptying.\r"

  ".W": "The highly specific ligand [125I]bovine (b) PTH-(1-34) and a chemical cross-linking technique were used to explore structural features of the canine renal cortical PTH receptor. Membranes isolated under conditions designed to inhibit endogenous proteolysis displayed a major 85K labeled PTH receptor moiety on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cross-linked receptors were solubilized with Lubrol-PX and partially purified by affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, and their hydrodynamic properties were assessed [Stokes radius = 7.3 +/- 0.1 nm; sedimentation coefficient = 6.4 +/- 0.2S; partial specific volume = 0.758 +/- 0.01 ml/g; frictional coefficient = 1.68 +/- 0.04; mol wt (Mr) = 216,000 +/- 14,000]. Corrections for detergent binding and for the presence of carbohydrate yielded an estimated Mr of 166,000 +/- 11,000 for the solubilized PTH receptor. Thus, the renal PTH receptor is oligomeric, with a Mr approximating that expected of a homodimer of 85K subunits. Peptide-mapping experiments revealed the presence within the 85K PTH receptor subunit of at least two major regions sensitive to proteolytic attack. Both elastase and an endogenous renal protease(s) cleaved the PTH receptor to a 70K form that is fully functional with respect to high affinity, guanyl nucleotide-sensitive PTH binding. Cleavage in a second domain by elastase, S. aureus V8 protease, or chymotrypsin generated a 50K labeled PTH receptor fragment. Cleavage at this second site was prevented by prior occupancy of the receptor with [125I]bPTH-(1-34), suggesting that this domain may be functionally important. Reduction of receptor disulfide bonds with dithiothreitol and beta-mercaptoethanol released a low Mr (less than or equal to 14K) labeled PTH receptor component, similar treatment of renal membranes abolished specific PTH binding, indicating that an intact disulfide bond(s) is essential for receptor function. These results provide new insights into the structural basis of PTH receptor function.\r"

The two major biologically active products of preproglucagon-I processing (glucagon-I and GLP-I) have now been purified to homogeneity. Their structures were determined using automated gas phase Edman degradation, tryptic mapping, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The preproglucagon-I-processing sites were identified.

Antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal peptide (C-91) and the amino-terminal peptide (N-98) specifically immunoprecipitated the hc-erbA-beta proteins synthesized in vitro. Furthermore, 68% and 48% of the T3-binding activity of the hc-erbA-beta protein were immunoabsorbed by antibodies C-91 and N-98, respectively. These results indicate that C-91 and N-98 recognized hc-erbA-beta proteins. These antibodies were used to study the subcellular distribution of hc-erbA-beta protein in human cultured cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared from human A431 carcinoma cells; C-91 immunoabsorbed 50% of the specific T3-binding activity in these extracts. These results provide structural evidence to confirming that hc-erbA-beta is the T3 nuclear receptor. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and the cytosolic extracts were immunoprecipitated by C-91 or N-98. A protein with a mol wt of 58,000 (Cp58) was specifically immunoprecipitated by N-98 or C-91. Peptide mapping by V8 digestion and cyanogen bromide cleavage showed that the Cp58 molecules immunoprecipitated by N-98 or C-91 was identical. Indirect immunofluorescence using N-98 or C-91 indicated that Cp58 is present exclusively in the cytoplasm. Other human cultured cells, HepG2, MCF-7, IM-9, and KB, were also evaluated, and similar results were found. These results raised the possibility that a precursor of hc-erbA-beta may be present in the cytosol. The functional significance of the hc-erbA-beta-related cytosolic Cp58 remains to be established.\r"

  ".W": "Somatostatin-28 (S-28) is a naturally occurring N-terminally extended form of the tetradecapeptide somatostatin (S-14). The concept has arisen that S-28 is a gut hormone that regulates insulin secretion. This concept is based on 1) reports that S-28 is a more potent inhibitor of insulin secretion than S-14; 2) the finding that S-28 is present in D-cells of the intestine and is released after a meal; and 3) the demonstration of selective binding of S-28 to B-cells of the rat islet. To critically test this hypothesis we have 1) measured the circulating levels of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) during infusions of S-28 and S-14 to accurately compare their potencies to inhibit insulin and glucagon secretion from the in vivo dog pancreas, and 2) measured the circulating levels of endogenous SLI released after a meal and compared these to the circulating levels of infused S-28 needed to inhibit insulin secretion. Infusion of S-28 at rates of 170 and 500 pmol/min raised arterial SLI levels by 282 +/- 26 and 885 +/- 98 fmol/ml, respectively. Immunoreactive insulin (IRI) output was inhibited by 20 +/- 11% (P less than 0.05) and 52 +/- 7% (P less than 0.0005), respectively. Immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) output was not significantly altered by either dose. Pancreatic SLI output was inhibited by 32 +/- 5% (P less than 0.0005) by the 500 pmol/min infusion. Infusion of S-28 at 50 pmol/min increased arterial SLI by 108 +/- 17 fmol/ml, but did not alter IRI output (+4 +/- 20%). In comparison, infusion of S-14 (100 pmol/min) raised arterial SLI levels by a similar amount (110 +/- 21 fmol/ml), but, unlike S-28, inhibited both IRI (-50 +/- 6%, P less than 0.0005) and IRG output (-17 +/- 8%; P less than 0.05). Thus, comparable increments in arterial S-28 failed to reproduce the inhibition of IRI secretion seen during the S-14 infusion, while similar inhibition was seen with an 8-fold increment. This suggests that S-28 is significantly less potent than S-14 in the dog. After a mixed meal, endogenous SLI levels increased by 35 +/- 3 fmol/ml in arterial plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Insulin-like growth factor I, nerve growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta had no significant effect on hCG beta secretion. FGF at concentrations as low as 0.125 ng/ml significantly elevated medium hCG beta levels without increasing cell number or total cellular protein. FGF stimulation of secretion was not detectable until 2 h of treatment. Intracellular hCG beta remained constant (23%) relative to total hCG beta (cell plus medium) as total hCG beta increased 3-fold, suggesting that FGF stimulated de novo hCG beta synthesis. Insulin significantly augmented the FGF-induced hCG beta stimulation without stimulating hCG beta production itself.\r"

We have examined this process by analyzing insulin degradation products by HPLC. Monoiodoinsulin specifically labeled on either the A14 or B26 tyrosine residue was incubated with a cultured kidney epithelial cell line, and both intracellular and extracellular products were examined on HPLC. The products were then compared with products of known structure generated by hepatocytes and the enzyme insulin protease. Intracellular and extracellular products were different, suggesting two different degradative pathways, as previously shown in liver. The extracellular degradation products eluted from HPLC both before and after sulfitolysis similarly with hepatocyte products and products generated by insulin protease. The intracellular products also eluted identically with hepatocyte products. Based on comparisons with identified products, the kidney cell generates two fragments from the A chain of intact insulin, one with a cleavage at A13-A14 and the other at A14-A15. The B chain of intact insulin is cleaved in a number of different sites, resulting in peptides that elute identically with B chain peptides cleaved at B9-B10, B13-B14, B16-B17, B24-B25, and B25-B26. These similarities with hepatocytes and insulin protease suggest that liver and kidney have similar mechanisms for insulin degradation and that insulin protease or a very similar enzyme is involved in both tissues.\r"

  ".U": "89064598\r", 
  ".W": "The aim of this study was to define the maturational process of the LHRH neuron in the male rat and the role of the adrenal and testis. Maturing (7-week-old) and adult (12-week-old) male rats were adrenalectomized (ADX), castrated (TX), or ADX and TX; controls were sham operated. Two weeks later, LHRH release from explants of the median eminence area (MEA), MEA LHRH content, and serum testosterone (T) were determined. MEA were incubated for 5 min with 150 microM copper and then for 15 min with 10 microM prostaglandin E2 (Cu/PGE2). LHRH release in response to Cu/PGE2 increased 3-fold between 7 and 9 weeks of age [from 10.4 +/- 1.8 to 29.2 +/- 2.1 pg/15 min.MEA (mean +/- SE)], and there was no further increase thereafter. ADX, TX, or ADX plus TX of 7-week-old rats prevented the increase in Cu/PGE2-stimulated release. In contrast, ADX of 12-week-old rats did not alter LHRH release, whereas TX or ADX plus TX drastically reduced it (75%). The MEA content increased gradually between 7 and 14 weeks of age (from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 3.0 +/- 0.3 ng). ADX of either 7- or 12-week-old rats did not alter LHRH content, whereas TX or ADX plus TX reduced it to 1.3 ng in both age groups. Serum T increased 6.7-fold between 7 and 9 weeks of age (from 1.06 +/- 0.42 to 6.70 +/- 0.57 ng/ml), and there was no further increase thereafter. ADX of 7-week-old rats did not alter serum T, whereas ADX of 12-week-old rats reduced serum T to 0.62 +/- 0.15 ng/ml. Serum T was undetectable in TX or ADX plus TX rats of both age groups. In summary, maturation of the male reproductive system is associated with a moderate increase in LHRH content of the median eminence and marked increases in the secretory function of the LHRH neuron and in serum T; the testis is essential for these maturational increases. In addition to the testis, the adrenal is necessary for the maturational increase in the secretory function of the LHRH neuron, but not for the increase in LHRH content or that in serum T. It is proposed that dissociable mechanisms regulate LHRH secretion and content in the maturing male, and that T and a substance of adrenal origin (steroid?) are required for the maturational increase in secretory function of the LHRH neuron.\r"

In this study we investigated the effects of glucagon on insulin actions in adipocytes in vitro. Glucagon modified neither glucose oxidation nor lipogenesis stimulated by insulin. The antilipolytic action of insulin was decreased by preincubation of the cells with glucagon. Glucose transport enhanced by insulin was diminished by preincubation of the cells with glucagon. The decrease in antilipolysis was a lowering of the maximal response to insulin, whereas the decrease in glucose transport was a lowering of the sensitivity to insulin. These results suggested that glucagon does not necessarily inhibit all of the insulin actions, and that the mechanism of insulin stimulation of glucose transport, which is supposed to be mediated by glucagon-sensitive insulin receptor, is different from those of insulin-induced antilipolysis, glucose oxidation, and lipogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Cathepsin-D has been previously reported to cleave intact PTH into PTH-(1-34) and -(35-84) in membranous fractions of rat and bovine kidney. Whether PTH degradation occurs by intact kidney cells, however, has not been examined in detail. We have, therefore, examined this possibility using an opossum kidney (OK) cell line which possesses the characteristics of proximal renal tubules and responds to PTH. PTH radioimmunoreactivity recovered in trichloroacetic acid-soluble products and in fractions eluted from reverse phase HPLC was measured using an antibody directed to the midregion and C-terminus of PTH. In this study, intact OK cells, but not extracellular enzymes, cleaved human (h) PTH-(1-84) into three discrete fragments which were released into the medium in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion. Half-maximal velocity of PTH-degrading activity (PTHDA) was observed at 9 nM hPTH-(1-84). A 1000-fold molar excess of PTH antagonists [hPTH-(3-34) and [Tyr34]hPTH-(7-34)amide] markedly inhibited PTHDA, whereas ACTH, glucagon, or big gastrin did not suppress it, suggesting an involvement of the PTH receptor in PTHDA. This PTHDA was strongly inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and chymostatin, but not by trypsin inhibitor, elastatinal, or inhibitors of aspartic, cysteine, or metalloproteinases, suggesting that it is due to a seryl chymotrypsin-like endopeptidase. Analysis of chymotrypsin-digested products of hPTH-(1-84) eluted from HPLC exhibited five fragments detected by UV absorbance (210 nm), three of which were measurable by PTH RIA, and each corresponded to the three PTH fragments produced by OK cells. All three fragments were predominantly suppressed in the presence of chymostatin, suggesting that chymotrypsin-like activity is solely responsible for PTHDA in intact OK cells. To further explore the cleavage sites of PTH by chymotrypsin, amino acid analysis of chymotrypsin-cleaved products was performed. The results strongly support the conclusion that a chymotrypsin-like enzyme in OK cells cleaved the hormone between residues 23-24, and 34-35 to produce, at least, hPTH-(24-84) and -(35-84). Lysosomal blockers (chloroquine, ammonium chloride, or monensin) did not affect this PTHDA. Our present study indicates that chymotrypsin-like endopeptidase, but not other endopeptidase or lysosomal enzymes, is responsible for the limited hydrolysis of PTH by intact OK cells.\r"

  ".W": "We recently proposed a hypothesis for the molecular mechanism of the osteogenic action of fluoride in which it stimulates osteoblast proliferation via the inhibition of an osteoblastic acid phosphatase-like phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatase activity. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether orthovanadate, a known phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatase inhibitor, would mimic fluoride in the stimulation of bone cell proliferation and bone collagen synthesis in vitro. Orthovanadate inhibited the osteoblastic acid phosphatase activity and stimulated bone cell proliferation at the same low concentrations (i.e. 5-15 microM). At the mitogenic doses, orthovanadate also showed a dose-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase (a marker of mature osteoblasts) in cultured calvarial cells and stimulated bone collagen synthesis, as measured by the incorporation of [3H]proline and the conversion into [3H] hydroxyproline in organ calvaria cultures. Therefore, orthovanadate stimulated bone formation by increasing the number of mature osteoblasts mediated via stimulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Orthovanadate was dependent on the presence of a mitogen in cell medium for its mitogenic action in vitro and synergistically potentiated the mitogenic actions on osteoblasts of those growth factors, i.e. insulin, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor I, and skeletal growth factor, whose mitogenic action involved tyrosyl protein phosphorylation. However, the interaction between orthovanadate and basic fibroblast growth factor, a growth factor that does not appear to involve tyrosyl protein phosphorylation, on bone cell proliferation was additive. In summary, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of the osteoblastic phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatases can prolong and/or potentiate the mitogenic actions of growth factors, and thereby stimulates cell proliferation.\r"

  ".U": "89064616\r", 
  ".W": "The gubernaculum testis is the connective tissue organ that causes the testis to descend. How the process of testicular descent is regulated is not fully understood. Current hypotheses postulate that a nonandrogenic fetal testicular factor controls the first phase of descent, that is characterized by growth of the gubernaculum and transabdominal migration of the testis. When gonadal extracts from fetuses with ages corresponding to the first phase of testicular descent (50, 60, and 75 days) were tested on gubernacular cells, the growth stimulatory effect of testicular extracts exceeded the effect of both ovarian extract and fetal calf serum. Gonadal extracts from 80-, 90-, and 100-day-old fetuses showed only a minor sex difference. No sex difference or age-dependent changes were detected when fetal gonadal extracts were tested on murine 3T3 cells. Polypeptide growth factors (epidermal growth factor, insulin, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta) were tested for growth stimulatory activity and had only minor effects on gubernaculum cells. Fetal testicular hormones (anti-Mullerian hormone, inhibin, and androgenic steroids) did not induce initiation of DNA synthesis at concentrations that are highly bioactive in typical target systems. When testicular samples were dialyzed, the high mol wt fraction (greater than 3500) had lower growth stimulatory activity in gubernaculum cells, but not 3T3 cells. Bioactivity of ovarian extracts and fetal calf serum was not diminished after dialysis. The low mol wt fraction (less than 3500) of testicular extract was distinctly stimulatory to gubernaculum cells but not 3T3 cells, and the low mol wt fraction of ovarian extracts did not stimulate growth in either cell type. It was concluded that the fetal porcine testis during the first phase of testicular descent contains low mol wt factor(s) to which gubernaculum cells and not 3T3 cells are responsive. The bioactive fraction probably contains the factor(s) that initiate testicular descent. We suggest the name descendin for this new activity.\r"

  ".W": "Anterior pituitary corticotropes represent only 9-10% of the mixed pituitary cell population. However, their small size precludes their enrichment because they cannot be separated from the more abundant PRL and GH cells. They can be induced to enlarge by adrenalectomy, and this report describes the separation of larger CRH-responsive corticotropes from a subpopulation of small pituitary cells. The separation was done by counterflow centrifugation in an elutriator containing the Sanderson chamber which was designed to separate small cells under 15 micron in diameter. The corticotropes were initially eluted at flow rates under 30 ml/min along with other cells less than 12.5 micron in diameter. They were then stimulated for 2-4 h with 0.5 nM CRH and reeluted with the use of higher flow rates to separate the enlarged corticotropes from the unstimulated cells. Reelutriation of the entire pool of small cells produced an enrichment to 60% corticotropes in five separate experiments. However, when the pool was divided into smaller cells (eluted at 20 ml/min) and medium-sized cells (eluted at 30 ml/min), and the two pools were reeluted separately, the enrichment increased to over 90% corticotropes in eight separate experiments. These corticotrope populations remained enriched for up to 14 days in culture. They also secreted in a reverse hemolytic plaque assay that recognizes ACTH-(25-39). The dual labels for ACTH and beta-endorphin showed that 60% of the corticotropes stored both peptides, whereas 30% stored only ACTH, and 10% stored only beta-endorphin. No differences in storage patterns were seen when small and medium-sized corticotropes were compared. Thus, these studies present the first report of the production of an enriched fraction of CRH-responsive corticotropes by counterflow centrifugation and the first report of heterogeneous storage of ACTH and beta-endorphin. The use of enriched fractions facilitated the analysis of these heterogeneous storage patterns in over 8000 corticotropes.\r"

  ".W": "The intrahypothalamic site(s) of endogenous opioid regulation of GnRH secretion remains to be resolved. Accordingly, we used an in vitro acute incubation system to evaluate GnRH, dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE) release from adult male rat median eminences (MEs) in response to the opiate receptor agonist morphine (MOR) and the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone (NAL). MOR (2 mM) stimulated basal and K+-induced GnRH release from isolated MEs, but 0.25, 5, or 100 microM MOR was without significant effect. NAL (1 mg/ml; 2.8 mM) increased basal GnRH release, but 0.01 mg NAL/ml suppressed basal GnRH release, and neither 0.001 nor 0.1 mg NAL/ml had an appreciable effect. NAL did not significantly alter K+-induced GnRH release. In a separate experiment, 1 mg NAL/ml stimulated but 0.01 mg NAL/ml inhibited basal release of DA and NE from the ME. NAL (1 ng/ml) also decreased K+-induced DA and NE release. The rates of basal and K+-induced DA and NE release were highly correlated with GnRH release during corresponding 0, 0.01, and 1.0 mg/ml NAL treatments in the preceding experiment (r = 0.98 and 0.93, respectively). Thus, 2 mM MOR stimulated but different NAL dosages either stimulated or inhibited GnRH release from isolated MEs, suggesting complex opioid regulation at the level of the GnRH neurosecretory terminals. The precise correlation between GnRH and DA/NE release suggests that the catecholamine terminals close to both GnRH- and endorphin-containing terminals in the ME may mediate this opioid regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Preovulatory follicles from cyclic proestrous rats were incubated in vitro in M199 for up to 24 hours with various doses of human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF). Stepwise increases in progesterone (P) production (20-80 ng/ml/2 follicle/24 hours) were observed with 30-300 pM TNF; 3000 pM TNF reduced (p less than 0.001) P production compared to 300 pM TNF but it was still higher (p less than 0.001) than controls. Follicular androstenedione production was inhibited by low doses of TNF (30-60 pM TNF) and stimulated by 3000 pM TNF. TNF did not alter follicular estradiol (E2) production. The time course studies using 300 pM TNF revealed that follicular P production did not increase significantly until 24 hours in culture unlike LH (160 pM) which increased P by 6 hours. Preincubation of 30 pM TNF with a monoclonal antibody to human recombinant TNF alpha prevented the increase in follicular P production observed at 24 hours in TNF-treated controls. These results indicate that in vitro TNF stimulates follicular P production but only after a lag period and thus provide a basis for future studies elucidating the role of TNF in follicular development.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, oenological prejudices were challenged by the use of a points scoring system (from 50 to 100) to evaluate wine in a book now widely regarded as one of the most authoritative. On this scale, a 1981 Chateau Citran described as 'emaciated' scored 65, a 1983 Chateau Kirwan scored 85, and a 1982 Petrus 100. If the same approach were used for drugs used in ulcerative colitis to quantify an advance over conditions existing at the time of its introduction how would they score? Because they were the first available drugs in their class and clearly constituted major advances, corticosteroids and sulphasalazine both score 95, the score being limited by a high level of side effects. The new salicylates score 75, because they extend the benefits of sulphasalazine to a minority of patients but they have the potential to score 90 if increased dosing and greater effectiveness over sulphasalazine can be achieved. Salicylate enemas score 80, because they advance treatment over topical corticosteroids for patients with resistant distal disease, but the mode of delivery needs improvement. Steroid foams also score 80, particularly if the patient's vote is taken into account. Azathioprine's score cannot be calculated because there is doubt over its efficacy, but it is potentially 88 if it saves patients with difficult disease from colectomy. We can only guess what an oral non-absorbed steroid would score, but if response rates for relapse were substantially improved, or if corticosteroids could be used as effective maintenance treatment, it could be as high as 95. There are indications that we should 'watch this space'.\r"

  ".W": "To establish whether concentrations of eicosanoids determined by equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces and equilibrium in vivo dialysis of rectum might predict a relapse in ulcerative colitis, 23 patients with completely inactive disease, maintained on sulphasalazine, stopped treatment and entered a prospective study. Concentrations of prostaglandin E2 were determined by radioimmunoassay on purified faecal and rectal dialysates at entry, at two weeks, and at two, six, and 12 months. If the above concentrations exceeded control concentrations (0.5 ng/ml and 1.0 ng/ml in faecal and rectal fluid, respectively) at any study day, the patient was allocated at random to double blind treatment with sulphasalazine 2 g/day, or placebo for six months. A relapse, defined as recurrence of symptoms accompanied by endoscopic inflammation occurred in none of six and in four of five patients allocated to sulphasalazine and placebo, respectively (p less than 0.05). In no case a normal rectal prostaglandin E2 concentration was associated with a relapse in the short term, but only two of 12 patients observed passively remained in remission. In retrospect, leukotriene B4 was a less sensitive predictor of relapse than prostaglandin E2. We conclude that raised concentrations of prostaglandin E2 in rectal dialysis fluid identify patients with a substantial risk of relapse.\r"

Antral biopsies were taken for bacteriological and histological examination, and endoscopies and clinical questionnaires were administered before and after treatment. Fifty two patients (25 on De-Nol and 27 on placebo) completed the trial. De-Nol cleared C pylori from 10 of the 12 C pylori positive patients (83.3%), whereas placebo did not clear C pylori from any of the eight C pylori positive patients (p less than 0.01). In patients receiving De-Nol gastritis improved (p less than 0.01) and symptomatic response was better (p less than 0.001) compared with placebo.

  ".W": "Clearly, many aspects of the action of neuromuscular blockers remain poorly understood at the molecular level. In the case of competitive blockers, blockade of EPPs by competitive binding to the ACh receptor site accounts for the most clinically important aspect of blockade. Although train-of-four fade produced by curare and some other competitive agents probably represents a presynaptic action, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect have not been addressed. Depolarizing blockade is inherently more complicated than competitive blockade. Simple depolarization and inactivation of the mechanism for generation of the action potential probably account for the major clinical effect seen in phase I block. Furthermore, the relative balance between activation of channels and desensitization may also provide a qualitative explanation for phase II block and tachyphylaxis. However, effects that are more likely to be explained by presynaptic actions of depolarizing blockers have also been described, and it is not yet possible to assess quantitatively whether the rates of onset of the different postsynaptic actions can account for most aspects of depolarizing block. This discussion has raised several issues which need to be addressed in future studies. 1. What are the presynaptic effects of cholinergic drugs? Do these drugs act through a specific receptor or, on other ion channels in the terminal membrane, or do they operate by mechanisms distinct from effects on membrane conductance? Can any of the observations be explained by indirect effects mediated through postsynaptic ACh receptors, e.g., K+ release? 2. What are the factors that influence variability in sensitivity to neuromuscular blockers among species, muscles within species, and during development? Many of the potential factors, e.g., differences in safety factor, resting conductances, ACh receptor type, and differences in the presence and absence of presynaptic receptors, have been outlined, but definitive tests of the contribution of any particular mechanisms are lacking. 3. Does modulation of desensitization play a role in any components of neuromuscular blockade? 4. Can trapping of blocking agents in ion channels in some cases account for slowly reversible components of blockade? 5. Can closed-channel block provide an effective mechanism of neuromuscular block?\r"

We evaluated three such methods: (1) measurement of the change in the transcutaneous PO2 after inhalation of oxygen; (2) determination, by the Doppler method, of segmental blood pressure; and (3) measurement of the temperature of the skin. The records of eighty patients (ninety amputations) were retrospectively reviewed for correlations between the results of the vascular studies and the outcome of the amputation. Measurement of transcutaneous PO2 was found to be the most accurate predictor of successful healing of an amputation; the other two measurements were less reliable. The values for transcutaneous PO2 both at rest and after inhalation of oxygen were significantly different (p less than 0.001) for the patients who had a healed amputation compared with those who had a failed amputation. Regardless of the initial value, if, after inhalation of oxygen, the transcutaneous PO2 reached ten millimeters of mercury or more, it predicted healing of the amputation stump with a sensitivity of 98 per cent. When the level of amputation was selected on the basis of clinical judgment at the time of operation, the sensitivity was only 90 per cent.\r"

One darkly stained clone, called here the BP clone, was further characterized. 9 of 9 BP sera, but none of 6 normal and 11 pemphigus sera, bound the plaques of this BP clone. Furthermore, BP IgG affinity purified on plaques of this clone, but not unrelated clones, bound the epidermal basement membrane by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitated the 230-kD BP antigen from extracts of cultured keratinocytes. Eco RI digestion of the BP clone's cDNA insert demonstrated a 680- and 1,500-bp fragment. Northern blots of total keratinocyte RNA showed that complementary riboprobes transcribed from both fragments hybridized to a 9-kb RNA. Dideoxy DNA sequencing from the 5' end of the BP cDNA demonstrated a 1,992-bp open reading frame, encoding a peptide of 76 kD.

  ".W": "The chronic and acute effects of different types of dietary fat on postprandial lipoprotein metabolism were studied in eight normolipidemic subjects. Each person was placed for 25 d on each of three isocaloric diets: a saturated fat (SFA), a w-6 polyunsaturated fat (w-6 PUFA) and a w-3 polyunsaturated fat (w-3 PUFA) diet. Two vitamin A-fat loading tests were done on each diet. The concentrations in total plasma and chylomicron (Sf greater than 1,000) and nonchylomicron (Sf less than 1,000) fractions of retinyl palmitate (RP) were measured for 12 h postprandially. Compared with the SFA diet, the w-6 PUFA diet reduced chylomicron and nonchylomicron RP levels 56 and 38%, respectively, and the w-3 PUFA diet reduced these levels 67 and 53%, respectively. On further analysis, the main determinant of postprandial lipoprotein levels was the type of fat that was chronically fed, which appeared to mediate its effect by changing the concentration of the endogenous competitor for the system that catabolizes triglyeride-rich lipoproteins. However, there was a significant effect of the acute dietary fat load, which appeared to be due to a differential susceptibility to lipolysis of chylomicrons produced by SFA as opposed to PUFA fat loads. The levels of postprandial lipoproteins are determined by the interaction of these chronic and acute effects.\r"

  ".U": "89067478\r", 
  ".W": "The specific pattern of lymphocyte localization and recirculation is important for the induction and expression of normal immune responses. In order to home to lymph nodes (LN), lymphocytes must first recognize and bind to specific high endothelial venules (HEV) in the LN. Binding to LN HEV is mediated by specific lymphocyte receptors, termed homing receptors, which are recognized by the mAb MEL-14. We examined the changes that occur in homing receptor expression after activation of murine T lymphocytes in vitro. Cells activated in MLC or by Con A undergo a 75% loss in their ability to recognize HEV, as demonstrated by a decrease in binding to HEV in vitro. Large, activated cells isolated from a primary MLC by elutriator centrifugation were completely unable to recognize HEV, whereas the small cells in the same culture continued to bind well. Flow cytometric analysis with MEL-14 showed that the activated fraction had lost expression of gp90MEL-14, the homing receptor Ag, whereas the inactivated cells remained MEL-14+. Concomitant with the loss of homing receptor expression, most of the activated cells became strongly peanut agglutinin (PNA)-positive, demonstrating a marked change in surface glycosylation. Thus, these MLC consist of two major populations of T cells--small, inactivated lymphocytes that are MEL-14+PNAlo and large, activated blast cells that are MEL-14-PNAhi. Purified MEL-14+ T cells activated by Con A gave rise to MEL-14- progeny, showing that gp90MEL-14 is lost from gp90MEL-14-positive precursors, rather than from the selective growth of MEL-14- cells. Furthermore, the loss of Ag expression on at least some activated cells is reversible in resting culture, with almost half of the cells reverting to MEL-14+ after the cessation of stimulation. These experiments show that activation of T cells results in down-regulation of surface homing receptors, resulting in their inability to recognize and bind to the endothelial surface of HEV. This suggests that the activation of T cells in vivo would result in a dramatic and physiologically significant change in their migration and localization properties which would be important during a normal immune response.\r"

  ".W": "The common occurrence of fibrin deposits in chronic inflammatory lesions suggests a possible role for thrombin in the mobilization of mononuclear cell infiltrates. For this reason, the effect of thrombin on the binding of mononuclear cells to endothelial cells (EC) was investigated. Incubation of confluent monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with thrombin markedly enhanced EC adhesiveness for both T lymphocytes and U937 cells (a monocyte-like cell line) in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. This effect was EC specific: 1) treatment of the T cells or the U937 cells with thrombin did not stimulate their adherence to EC, and 2) treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts with thrombin did not stimulate their inherently low adhesiveness for T cells. Fixation of EC monolayers with paraformaldehyde after pre-incubation with thrombin did not affect the increased adhesiveness for T cells. mAb against the LFA-1 antigen (mAb 60.3 (anti-CD18) or mAb TS1/22 (anti-CD11a), which inhibit the binding of T cells to unstimulated EC, failed to block the increased adhesion induced by thrombin, indicating that the increased binding induced by thrombin is similar to that induced by IL-1 and TNF, which showed similar resistance. These results suggest that thrombin may have a role in the extravascular emigration of mononuclear cells from post-capillary venules by virtue of its ability to stimulate the adhesiveness of EC for both lymphocytes and monocytes.\r"

Lymphocyte transfusion experiments and in vivo depletion studies have demonstrated that RT6+ T cells have an important regulatory role in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in BB/Wor rats. In the present study, the results of genetic complementation studies indicate that the DP rat contains an intact RT6 gene, but fails to express the RT6.1 alloantigen in the functional absence of an accessory factor (provided by RT6+ cells). At the cellular level, irradiation chimeras demonstrate that the absence of RT6+ T cells in DP rats is due to an intrinsic defect that results in abnormal development and/or differentiation of prothymocytes into RT6+ T cells. The inability of DP prothymocytes to generate RT6+ T cells is not due to serum autoantibodies, lack of accessory cells, or to the presence of inhibitory cells. Inasmuch as DP bone marrow can transfer the susceptibility for diabetes to irradiated recipients, our present results suggest that an important predisposing factor for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in DP rats is the inability of DP prothymocytes to generate RT6+ T cells.\r"

  ".W": "The frequency of cell precursors producing Ig of different classes and Ag-binding activities were determined, using EBV-infection and limiting dilution assays, in healthy subjects and patients with autoimmune disease. A large proportion of circulating B cells from healthy subjects were committed to the production of IgM antibodies that were polyreactive and bound a variety of self- and exogenous Ag, i.e., IgG Fc fragment, ssDNA, thyroglobulin, thyroid microsomal Ag, insulin, and tetanus toxoid. Similar frequencies of these polyreactive antibody-producing cells were found in patients with Hashimoto's disease and SLE. In contrast, significantly higher frequencies of cell precursors producing monoreactive IgG autoantibodies to thyroid Ag (thyroglobulin and thyroid microsomal Ag) and ssDNA were found in Hashimoto's disease and SLE patients, respectively. Calculation of the Kd revealed that monoclonal polyreactive antibodies were in general low affinity (Kd, 10(-3) to 10(-7) mol/liter), whereas monoclonal monoreactive autoantibodies were high affinity (Kd, 10(-9) to 10(-11) mol/liter). The detected frequency and high affinity of the monoreactive autoantibodies in Hashimoto's disease and SLE patients were comparable to those of anti-tetanus toxoid and anti-insulin IgG mAb produced by B cell clones from vaccinated healthy subjects and insulin-treated patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that the autoimmune B cell repertoire in patients with organ-specific and systemic autoimmunity is shaped by Ag-driven responses rather than merely reflecting a polyclonal B cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the recognition repertoire of 16 human alloreactive T cell clones (ATLC) derived from cells invading an irreversibly rejected kidney allograft. These clones, which specifically proliferated against the kidney donor B lymphoblastoid cell line, fell into two classes: CD4+ killers and CD8+ killers. Cytotoxic and proliferative activities of the ATLC were studied by using a panel of allogeneic cells sharing HLA specificities with kidney donor cells. Moreover, mAb recognizing monomorphic parts of HLA class I and class II molecules were used in blocking experiments of ATLC cytotoxicity. The results obtained from proliferative and cytotoxic assays were concordant. All ATLC investigated were directed against HLA molecules, and some clones were found to recognize HLA-B, -C, -DP, -DQ, or -DR products. All anti-HLA class I ATLC were CD8+, whereas both CD4+ and CD8+ ATLC were committed against HLA class II specificities. Nine of 16 ATLC were shown to react against serologically defined donor HLA determinants. These data indicate the recognition of HLA determinants in the course of an in vivo alloimmune response and particularly emphasize the role of HLA-C and DP loci products so far ignored in clinical transplantation.\r"

We have previously shown that this inhibition is mediated by binding of the IgG anti-Ig to receptors for Fc gamma R on B cells. This report describes conditions under which IgG anti-mu or anti-delta will induce proliferation despite Fc gamma R engagement. Culture supernatants of Con A-stimulated, Il-4-secreting Th cell lines, but not of Il-2-secreting Th cell lines, will co-stimulate with IgG anti-Ig to induce small B cells to incorporate [3H]TdR. This co-mitogenic activity is inhibitable by anti-IL-4 antibodies and can also be induced by Il-4 affinity purified from the T cell supernatants or by supernatants containing rIl-4. B cells precultured with Il-4 for 18 h, while still expressing normal levels of Fc gamma R, also proliferate to IgG anti-Ig. We have previously shown that Fc gamma R-mIg cross-linking will inhibit mIg-dependent increases in c-myc mRNA levels. We investigated whether Il-4 allows B cells to respond to IgG anti-Ig by elevating c-myc. The data show that Il-4 has little effect on c-myc mRNA levels in either IgG or Fab'2 anti-Ig-containing cultures.\r"

It was found that C1-depleted and C1q-depleted sera were as effective as the undepleted serum in the lysis of ELPS sensitized with RaRF. Addition of the C1 component or C1q subcomponent to the depleted sera did not increase the effect. On the other hand, C4 and C2 components were found to be essential for the lysis of RaRF-sensitized ELPS. Activities of C4 and C2 remained on the sensitized cells even after washing the cells, suggesting that the classical C3 convertase, C4b2a, is generated on the RaRF-sensitized ELPS.\r"

This form of positive cooperative binding of antibody to Ag was hypothesized to result from noncovalent association of Fc regions of antibodies bound close to one another on the Ag surface. Because IgG3 Fc regions are self-aggregating and IgG3 molecules are frequently cryoprecipitable, we have now investigated the effect of temperature on the binding, and cooperative binding, of IgG3 anti-GAC mAb to solid-phase (sp) Ag. The Ag used was a covalent conjugate of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc; the epitopes on GAC) and BSA. The main findings were: 1) IgG3 anti-GAC mAb bind to sp GlcNAc-BSA to greater extents at lower temperatures, 2) IgM anti-GAC mAb and Fab and F(ab')2 fragments, derived from an IgG3 anti-GAC mAb, bind to sp GlcNAc-BSA to comparable extents at different temperatures, 3) idiotope-expressing IgG3 anti-GAC mAb bind to sp anti-idiotope to comparable extents at different temperatures, and 4) unlabeled IgG3 anti-GAC mAb enhance the binding of radiolabeled IgG3 anti-GAC mAb to sp GlcNAc-BSA, and the degree of this enhancement is greater at lower temperature. These, and additional results, support the conclusion that for some sp Ag the functional affinities of IgG3 antibodies, are influenced by the Fc region in a temperature-dependent manner.\r"

In contrast, relatively low levels of this transcript were observed in EBV-transformed B cells, in the immature Jurkat T cell line, and in chronic myelogenous leukemia myeloblasts and lymphoblasts. The beta-transcript was undetectable in the K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis cell line with erythroblastic characteristics and in cultured skin fibroblasts. Two acute myeloid leukemia samples displayed unusually high levels of this transcript, comparable to levels observed in mature PBL. beta-subunit mRNA expression appeared to be primarily confined to leukocytes.

Seven defined treponemal Ag (47 kDa, 37 kDa, 35, 33-kDa, 30-kDa, 14 kDa, and 12 kDa) stimulated lymphocytes from infected rabbits. Cellular responses to the 37-kDa and 30-kDa fractions were evident by day 6 of infection and responses to the 35, 33-kDa and 14-kDa Ag were first detected on day 10; responsiveness to these Ag continued throughout the observation period. Cellular responses to the 47-kDa molecule were detectable but lower when compared with other individual Ag. Responsiveness to the 12-kDa Ag was not evident until 7 mo postinfection. Specific immunoblot reactivity of serum from rabbits used in this study generally correlated with the development of cellular reactivity to individual Ag of T. pallidum.\r"

These sera were subsequently tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody specificity by type-specific peptide EIAs (PEIA) and western blot (WB) analysis for both viruses. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) from representative individuals were cultured in the presence of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal donor PBMCs. These cultures were periodically monitored for HIV-1 and HIV-2 proviral sequences by using the selective DNA amplification technique polymerase chain reaction (PCR). As an outgrowth of this study, we report the case of a person dually reactive by various serological techniques in whom proviral sequences from HIV-1 and HIV-2 were detected by PCR. This is the first confirmed case of a mixed HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection in a single individual.\r"

Neutrophils from patients with ARC showed significantly less chemotaxis (P less than or equal to .025) than did those from patients with AIDS and KS or from controls. Serum from patients with AIDS and KS or with ARC significantly (P less than or equal to .05) inhibited chemotaxis of neutrophils from controls; heat treatment of the serum abolished this inhibitory effect. Bacterial killing by neutrophils from patients with AIDS and KS or with ARC was also significantly (P less than or equal to .05) less than for neutrophils from controls, as was neutrophil phagocytosis binding of Candida albicans (P less than or equal to .05). Expression of OKM1 antigen was increased in the patients studied. Enzyme degranulation, adherence, and aggregation were also examined. The defects found in neutrophil function are selective and may be important in the increased susceptibility of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection to bacterial and fungal infections.\r"

Patterns of DNA fragments from HindIII digests of samples of total DNA were conserved among strains of the same M serotype yet were easily distinguished from those of different M serotypes. Different M types were associated with specific restriction enzyme profiles. DNA fingerprints of strains of the same M type were stable enough to establish a clonal relationship between strains obtained from an isolated outbreak of disease or strains endogenous to people geographically isolated by continent. Strains of the same serotype from different continents had very similar, but distinguishable, restriction profiles. Those strains unable to be typed with standard typing sera were also amenable to comparison because they yielded unique fingerprints.\r"

  ".W": "We studied five different tests for diagnosing conjunctival Chlamydia trachomatis infection in specimens obtained from 100 children with moderate-to-severe trachoma. The tests were Giemsa stain, isolation in cell culture, direct fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody, enzyme immunoassay, and a DNA probe. The Giemsa stain was least sensitive at 29%. The other tests gave essentially equivalent performances: sensitivity ranged from 73% to 84% and specificity from 93% to 100%. Seven of the 45 positive specimens were only positive in cell culture, whereas 11 of the 45 were negative in culture but positive in at least two nonculture tests. We speculate that these discordant results actually reflect the biologic status of the chlamydial infection. There appears to be a stage in the infection where chlamydial antigens and nucleic acids can be detected in the absence of infectivity. This stage of infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of trachoma by providing a source of sensitizing antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Although much is known about the natural history of HIV infection, many issues remain unresolved and require additional study. At least four major questions require further investigation. (1) Current data suggest that most HIV-infected persons will eventually develop AIDS. The proportion of all infected persons who will eventually develop AIDS, as well as the average and maximum incubation periods, have not yet been conclusively defined. (2) Certain clinical signs (such as oral candidiasis) or laboratory test results (such as a depressed T4 count) may indicate a poorer prognosis. However, the predictive value of such indicators for a specific patient and in an individual situation varies. Combinations of clinical and laboratory data may help refine estimates of the likelihood of developing AIDS or other HIV-related diseases. (3) Why some HIV-infected persons develop disease and others do not is not completely understood. The role of cofactors for disease progression needs additional investigation. There may be no one universal cofactor for progression but, rather, various agents that cause immune stimulation and reactivation of latent HIV. Therefore, exposure to a variety of infectious or environmental agents (such as through sexually transmitted diseases or injection of iv drugs) may accelerate progression to disease in HIV-infected persons. (4) It is not established whether antiviral agents will prevent or reduce the likelihood of disease progression in asymptomatic HIV-infected persons. If beneficial, should they be given to all HIV-infected persons or only to those whose clinical and laboratory evaluation suggests an increased likelihood of progression? Given these uncertainties, how should the physician or other health care worker evaluate, treat, and counsel the HIV-infected patient? Such patients should receive a comprehensive medical evaluation for both diagnostic and staging purposes; the details of such an evaluation are beyond the scope of this review and have been well described. A few brief points, however, should be emphasized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

He was the first person to conduct extensive temporal bone studies, starting by sectioning and examining a series of 41 bones (Toynbee, 1841) and progressing to a final report in the 1860's when his collection comprised well over 2,000 temporal bones. He described alterations in the inner ear; he demonstrated the otosclerotic fixation of the stapes and, in a large series of bones, he depicted the multitude of histopathological changes seen in the middle ear in chronic otitis media.\r"

Since septic cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is mainly a complication of facial abscesses and septic lateral sinus thrombosis (LST) is almost invariably due to chronic otitis media, both conditions are of clinical relevance to the otolaryngologist. The predominant bacterium in septic CST is Staphylococcus aureus whereas in septic LST the bacteriology is very similar to that found in chronic otitis media. The diagnosis of septic CST can be established in most cases after thorough clinical examination, and contrast computerized tomography (CT) using the coronal projection usually confirms the clinical diagnosis. The signs and clinical course of septic LST are non-specific and the final diagnosis rests upon radiological investigations including CT-scan. The treatment of both conditions consists of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including beta-lactamase resistant penicillin in cases of septic CST. Most cases of septic LST also require surgical intervention. Two cases of septic intracranial sinus thrombosis are presented. The need for early diagnosis and treatment of this potentially lethal condition is emphasized.\r"

The selection of items for this Breast Cancer Chemotherapy Questionnaire (BCQ) was based on the problems and experiences felt to be most important by women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. The BCQ consists of 30 questions that focus on loss of attractiveness, fatigue, physical symptoms, inconvenience, emotional distress, and feelings of hope and support from others. The BCQ, other instruments that evaluate quality-of-life (Spitzer, Karnofsky, and Rand), and patient and physician global assessments were administered serially to 418 patients taking part in a randomized trial comparing a 12-week regimen and a 36-week regimen of adjuvant chemotherapy. The validity of the BCQ is supported by its correlation with the Rand Emotional (r = .58), Rand Physical (r = .60), and Spitzer (r = .62) questionnaires. The BCQ correlated more strongly with global ratings of both physical and emotional function by the patients and their physicians than the other instruments. A comparison of the quality-of-life outcomes of patients in the two treatment groups in the period beyond 3 months after initiation of treatment, when one group had completed the treatment course and the other was still on treatment, revealed that the BCQ and Karnofsky were the only instruments able to demonstrate differences between the groups (P less than .0001). Hence, the BCQ is a valid and responsive method of assessing treatment-related morbidity in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II breast cancer.\r"

Clinically, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is widely used and is elevated in a majority of patients with metastatic breast cancer. However, it is falsely elevated in a wide range of nonmalignant conditions and correlates poorly with disease progression. We evaluated a newly described monoclonal antibody, CA 549, in an immunoradiometric assay which uses two monoclonal antibodies directed against tumor and milk fat globule membranes. CA 549 and CEA were studied in 682 patients, 331 of whom had breast diseases and 99 of whom were followed with multiple serum samples. Of 69 patients with benign breast diseases, 1.5% had elevated CA 549, 0% of 30 pregnant women had elevated CA 549, and 26% of patients with nonmalignant liver disease had CA 549 elevation. In metastatic cancer of prostate, ovary, endometrium, colon, and lung CA 549 was elevated in 12% to 50% of cases with levels less than 120 U/mL. In breast cancer, CA 549 was elevated in 11% of 88 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and had no evidence of metastasis; in 23% of 16 patients in complete remission after chemotherapy; in 63% of 52 patients in partial remission after therapy; and in 83% of 106 patients with progression of breast cancer compared with 63% with elevated CEA (P = .001). In diseases of the breast, CA 549 has a sensitivity In diseases of the breast, CA 549 has a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 92% v 61% and 92% for CEA. Of 99 patients serially monitored with clinically documented breast cancer progression, regression, or stability of disease, CA 549 was statistically significantly superior to CEA in monitoring a greater than 25% change in those patients with metastatic progression (P = .03). CA 549 is a new serum marker that should be control tested in prospective clinical trials alone or in conjunction with other markers.\r"

There were four events in the 38 children with stage I and II disease. One patient with massive mediastinal disease failed to remit and subsequently failed mantle irradiation and changes of chemotherapy. Another relapsed at the site of local disease and was salvaged with involved field irradiation and further courses of MOPP. Two other children died as a result of acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) following transfusion. At autopsy there was no evidence of Hodgkin's disease. Fifteen children had stage III and IV disease and 14 achieved complete remission (CR) and none have relapsed. The child who failed to achieve remission died of virus infections. A mediastinal mass greater than 1/3 the thoracic width was present in 19 children of whom 18 achieved remission and none relapsed.

Patients' ages ranged from 7 to 31 years (median, 10 years). Bone marrow karyotype abnormalities were present in five patients included four with monosomy 7 and one with trisomy 8. One patient was in complete remission before transplant; the remaining five had excess of blasts or were undergoing leukemic transformation. Donor, and recipient were mismatched at the DR locus (2), A locus (2), B locus (1), or A and B loci (1). Conditioning included busulfan, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, methylprednisolone, and total body irradiation. Cyclosporine was started on day -1. Marrows were T-cell depleted using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) (CD3) and normal rabbit serum. Four patients engrafted routinely. One patient died of aspergillosis before engraftment (day 12) and one patient failed to engraft on first attempt, but engrafted following additional preparation. Median time to neutrophils greater than 500/microL and platelets greater than 25,000/microL were 16 and 19 days, respectively. Acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) was less than or equal to grade II in all patients. One patient died with recurrent disease (day 257). One patient died at day 515 of pancreatitis and respiratory failure. Three patients are alive and disease-free at 240, 395, and 560 days post-BMT including two patients with unrelated donors. Partially matched T-depleted bone marrow from related or unrelated donors may be effective, and possibly curative therapy for patients with MDS who lack a histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor.\r"

We review the 79 patients with malignancy-associated Sweet's syndrome documented in the world literature. The most common underlying neoplasm was acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Lymphomas, chronic leukemias, myelomas, myelodysplastic syndromes, and a variety of solid tumors have also been observed. The onset of Sweet's syndrome either preceded or coincided with the discovery of a previously undiagnosed cancer in greater than 60% of malignancy-associated Sweet's syndrome patients. In contrast to patients with the idiopathic form of the disease, those with a malignancy often presented with more severe cutaneous lesions, cytopenias, and/or immature cells in the peripheral blood. Extracutaneous sites of involvement included the eyes, muscles and joints, kidneys, lungs, and liver. All the manifestations of Sweet's syndrome improved dramatically with corticosteroid therapy, regardless of the response of the associated neoplasm to tumor-directed therapy.\r"

Local leukocyte influx, proteinase, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels were measured after injection of hydroxyapatite type I ceramic (HAP), tricalcium phosphate ceramic (TCP) and apatite-wollastonite glass ceramic (GC) into the pouch. Synthetic monosodium urate crystals (MSU) were used as positive controls and normal saline (NS) was a negative control. The response was monitored over 168 h by irrigating the pouch with 5 ml of NS and withdrawing 4 ml. MSU produced the greatest response in leukocyte counts, proteinase and PGE2, whereas HAP, TCP and GC elicited less response. The peak response with HAP, TCP and GC often appeared later than with MSU. TNF activity was significantly detected only after ceramics and not after MSU. The chronic and relatively prolonged reaction to some ceramics suggests that an inflammatory reaction may be seen after human implantation of these ceramics. The increased levels of TNF and production of PGE2, which is one substance proposed to contribute to bone lysis associated with loosening, are of special interest.\r"

In our study scleroderma-like skin disease was evoked by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in rats. Intravital microscopy of the skin of these animals showed strongly dilated capillaries, resembling the dilated loops in patients. This finding demonstrates that chronic graft-versus-host (scleroderma-like) disease may be pertinent to study the pathogenesis of microvascular injury in scleroderma.\r"

Of the population with RA analyzed, 8.6% were consistently RF negative but APF positive. In view of its strong sensitivity and specificity for RA, APF determination is a valuable serological tool for the diagnosis of the disease.

In order to define such methods and pathology, we studied nine patients with chronic (greater than 6 months) unreduced anterior, posterior, superior, or central dislocations as well as one patient with a chronic rotator cuff injury; and seven scapular specimens, six with matching humeral specimens, with osseous abnormalities similar to those in the patients. We examined 15 additional scapular specimens with evidence of subluxation secondary to chronic rotator cuff injury. Standard, reformatted, and three-dimensional (3D) CT techniques were used to evaluate both the patients and the specimens. Our results indicate that characteristic alterations occur in the scapula and humeral head that are far more extensive than the classic Hill-Sachs, Bankart, and trough lesions. Such alterations occur at sites of osseous contact between the malpositioned humerus and scapula and are modified owing to prolonged adjustments made by the patients in an attempt to increase GHJ motion. Although routine radiography and specialized views are of some value, standard and 3D CT provide a more accurate analysis of the location and extent of the bone abnormalities and, as such, should be employed, particularly in the evaluation of patients in whom surgery is being considered.\r"

Granular deposits of goat IgG, rabbit ACE and C3 were found in the basolateral compartment and were maximal during the first week of immunization when the highest titers of anti-ACE antibodies were present. As the antibody titer fell to an undetectable level, the immune deposits were rapidly cleared and were virtually absent 21 days after the injections. Artificial increase of glomerular permeability allowed focal binding of ACE antibodies to the brush border of some tubules, but did not significantly alter the pattern of immune injury at the base of tubular cells. The data are consistent with the interpretation that the immune deposits result from in situ formation of immune complexes. This mechanism would involve passage of circulating antibodies across the tubular basement membrane and their combination with ACE associated with tubular cell surface membranes.\r"

Alternate means for measuring GFR involve the use of constant infusion and, frequently, of radioisotopes. We report herein the measurement of GFR with the use of a radiocontrast agent (diatrizoate meglumine) injected subcutaneously with a small amount of epinephrine (0.05 ml of 1:1000). The concentrations of this marker of glomerular filtration in blood and in urine were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography. The results demonstrate that with this method of administration stable blood levels are observed for at least three hours. Furthermore, creatinine clearance overestimated GFR by 50% and by 68% in patients with renal disease and in renal transplant recipients, respectively. This method offers several advantages: 1) the use of commonly available and inexpensive materials; 2) obviates the need for the use of constant infusions; and 3) avoids the use of radioisotopes.\r"

Histologic examination revealed 112 glial neoplasms, 70 nonglial tumors, and 44 nonneoplastic lesions. The overall morbidity was 9.3% (21 of 226 patients were worse after the procedure), and the 30-day operative mortality was 1% (2 patients). The procedure provides maximal cytoreduction in high-grade glial neoplasms but is most beneficial to patients who have histologically circumscribed tumors, such as pilocytic astrocytomas, metastatic neoplasms, and miscellaneous nonglial and nonneoplastic lesions.\r"

The specific techniques used for this purpose are described, and the applications to cancer cell bioenergetics and phospholipid metabolism in drug-resistant and drug-sensitive breast cancer cells are illustrated. Spectra of the same cell line grown in a \"model tumor\" in natural basement membrane gel and in nude mice in vivo are compared. The results indicate a potential for the use of 31P MRS in a clinical setting for monitoring therapy and for diagnosis.\r"

Patients with various types of chronic respiratory failure may benefit from this approach. Evaluation for long-term mechanical ventilation necessitates assessment of the underlying disease process, the goals of the medical team, and the needs of the patient and family. Externally applied negative-pressure devices can provide adequate ventilation for many patients, particularly those with neuromuscular diseases. Positive-pressure ventilation by means of a tracheostomy provides greater control of the airway, allows adjustment of tidal volume and minute ventilation, and may be delivered by portable equipment. Ongoing care and support services in the home must be provided. A variety of mechanical devices and new techniques of ventilator support have made home mechanical ventilation a realistic option for long-term care.\r"

Recent reports suggest that these patients may have adverse effects from subclinical hyperthyroidism, including abnormally short systolic time intervals, elevations in liver enzymes, and reductions in bone density. Controversy exists about which thyroid function tests should be used to monitor patients taking levothyroxine. A review of currently available data suggests that replacement doses of levothyroxine given to hypothyroid patients should be adjusted so that serum TSH measured by the new sensitive assays is within the normal range. Patients requiring suppressive doses of levothyroxine to shrink goitrous thyroid tissue or to prevent growth of abnormal tissue should be given the minimal dose needed to accomplish the desired clinical or biochemical response.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant mesothelioma of the pleura most commonly occurs in persons with a heavy occupational exposure to asbestos. Some patients, however, have no such history of exposure. Clinical features include initial complaints of nonpleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. The most frequent roentgenographic finding is a unilateral pleural effusion. Thrombocytosis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates are common. Pleural effusions are typically exudates, are often hemorrhagic, and are usually insufficient for diagnosing mesothelioma based on cytology alone. Even pleural biopsy may not produce enough tissue to enable the pathologist to make a firm diagnosis. Thoracotomy and open biopsy will confirm the diagnosis in most cases. Pathologic distinction from metastatic adenocarcinoma may be difficult even after the use of special stains and electron microscopy. Clinical deterioration is primarily attributable to local spread of tumor. Several factors seem to predict prolonged survival: (1) epithelial histologic subtype, (2) performance score, (3) age of the patient at the time of diagnosis, and (4) absence of chest pain. Surgical treatment, chemotherapy, and irradiation, alone or in combination, have been used for malignant mesothelioma. Except for the palliative effect of irradiation, most treatment protocols have not altered the dismal median survival of approximately 11 months seen in untreated patients with malignant mesothelioma.\r"

By means of intra-arterial ambulatory monitoring the haemodynamic effects were followed for 18 h after the infusions were stopped. Adrenaline, but not noradrenaline, caused a delayed and protracted pressor effect. Over the total postinfusion period systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were 6 (SEM 2)% and 7 (2)%, respectively, higher than after dextrose infusion (ANOVA, p less than 0.001). Thus, \"stress\" levels of adrenaline (230 pg/ml) for 6 h cause a delayed and protracted pressor effect. These findings are strong support for the adrenaline-hypertension hypothesis in man.\r"

The University of Washington experience with the sublabial transseptal transsphenoidal approach to the sella in a series of 253 patients is reported with respect to the otolaryngological aspects of the surgical technique, results, and complications of the procedure. In addition, a literature review of major studies that used this procedure is included, and the reported results and complications are compared to those of the present study.\r"

  ".U": "89070611\r", 
  ".W": "During the investigational use of oral N-acetylcysteine as an antidote for poisoning with acetaminophen, 11,195 cases of suspected acetaminophen overdose were reported. We describe the outcomes of 2540 patients with acetaminophen ingestions treated with a loading dose of 140 mg of oral N-acetylcysteine per kilogram of body weight, followed four hours later by 70 mg per kilogram given every four hours for an additional 17 doses. Patients were categorized for analysis on the basis of initial plasma acetaminophen concentrations and the interval between ingestion and treatment. Hepatotoxicity developed in 6.1 percent of patients at probable risk when N-acetylcysteine was started within 10 hours of acetaminophen ingestion and in 26.4 percent of such patients when therapy was begun 10 to 24 hours after ingestion. Among patients at high risk who were treated 16 to 24 hours after an acetaminophen overdose, hepatotoxicity developed in 41 percent--a rate lower than that among historical controls. When given within eight hours of acetaminophen ingestion, N-acetylcysteine was protective regardless of the initial plasma acetaminophen concentration. There was no difference in outcome whether N-acetylcysteine was started zero to four or four to eight hours after ingestion, but efficacy decreased with further delay. There were 11 deaths among the 2540 patients (0.43 percent); in the nine fatal cases in which aminotransferase was measured before treatment, values were elevated before N-acetylcysteine was started. No deaths were clearly caused by acetaminophen among patients in whom N-acetylcysteine therapy was begun within 16 hours. We conclude that N-acetylcysteine treatment should be started within eight hours of an acetaminophen overdose, but that treatment is still indicated at least as late as 24 hours after ingestion. On the basis of available data, the 72-hour regimen of oral N-acetylcysteine is as effective as the 20-hour intravenous regimen described previously, and it may be superior when treatment is delayed.\r"

Significant clinical benefits and adverse experiences have been reported from this trial. Because neuropsychiatric dysfunction is often associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a brief affective and neuropsychological examination was administered over 16 weeks of the trial to evaluate any changes in neuropsychological function that occurred with drug administration. Patients receiving zidovudine, particularly those with AIDS, showed improved cognition as compared with patients receiving placebo. There were no changes in affective symptoms. The zidovudine recipients also had a statistically significant reduction in the intensity of symptomatic distress during the trial that may account in part for the observed cognitive changes. Some improvement in various cognitive measures was also seen in patients with AIDS-related complex. The results of this study suggest HIV-associated cognitive abnormalities may be partially ameliorated after the administration of zidovudine.\r"

We evaluated these donor-recipient pairs before transplantation and at several points afterward for immediate skin-test reactivity to 17 allergens. For allergens for which pretransplantation skin tests had been positive in the donors and negative in the recipients, 20 of 46 post-transplantation skin tests were positive in 8 of the 11 recipients who survived for more than one year after transplantation. For allergens for which both donors and recipients had had negative skin tests before transplantation, only 6 of 256 tests (2.3 percent) were positive in the recipients after transplantation. Long-term transfer of donor-derived mite-specific IgE was demonstrated by radioallergosorbent testing in two recipients. Seven recipients either acquired or had an exacerbation of allergic rhinitis, and two recipients without a history of asthma had asthma one year after transplantation. We conclude that allergen-specific IgE-mediated hypersensitivity is adoptively transferred by bone marrow transplantation from donor to recipient by B cells with allergen-specific memory.\r"

  ".W": "Aplastic anemia is a syndrome in which pancytopenia occurs in the presence of hypocellularity of the bone marrow. To assess the biologic activities of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in aplastic anemia, we gave GM-CSF (60 to 500 micrograms per square meter of body-surface area) to 10 patients with moderate or severe disease, by continuous intravenous infusion daily for two weeks, and repeated the treatment after a two-week rest period. The treatment increased the white-cell count (1.6- to 10-fold) in all patients, primarily because of an increase in the numbers of neutrophils (1.5 to 20-fold), eosinophils (12- to greater than 70-fold), and monocytes (2- to 32-fold). Rates of hydrogen peroxide production in purified granulocyte fractions increased during GM-CSF treatment. Increases in bone marrow cellularity, myeloid precursor cells, and myeloid:erythroid cell ratios accompanied the white-cell response. Despite the in vivo response of the white-cells, the concentration of colony-forming cells remained the same. Measurable concentrations of interleukin-2 (2 to 15 units per milliliter) were found in the serum of 8 patients, and high levels of erythropoietin (81 to 1200 IU per liter) were found in 10 patients. The predominant side effects were constitutional symptoms. These results indicate that recombinant human GM-CSF is effective in stimulating myelopoiesis in patients with severe aplastic anemia and may benefit some patients in whom the disorder is refractory to standard forms of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Outgrowth of distinct axonal and dendritic processes is essential for the development of the functional polarity of nerve cells. In cultures of neurons from the hippocampus, where the differential outgrowth of axons and dendrites is readily discernible, we have sought molecules that might underlie the distinct modes of elongation of these two types of processes. One particularly interesting protein is GAP-43 (also termed B-50, F1 or P-57), a neuron-specific, membrane-associated phosphoprotein whose expression is dramatically elevated during neuronal development and regeneration. GAP-43 is among the most abundant proteins in neuronal growth cones, the motile structures that form the tips of advancing neurites, but its function in neuronal growth remains unknown. Using immunofluorescence staining, we show that GAP-43 is present in axons and concentrated in axonal growth cones of hippocampal neurons in culture. Surprisingly, we could not detect GAP-43 in growing dendrites and dendritic growth cones. These results show that GAP-43 is compartmentalized in developing nerve cells and provide the first direct evidence of important molecular differences between axonal and dendritic growth cones. The sorting and selective transport of GAP-43 may give axons and axonal growth cones certain of their distinctive properties, such as the ability to grow rapidly over long distances or the manner in which they recognize and respond to cues in their environment.\r"

Nonfatal stroke occurred in 2%, and TIA occurred in 1%. There was no perioperative mortality. Our study suggests that, under local anesthesia, even high risk patients can be operated safely and the majority of carotid endarterectomies can be performed without the use of an indwelling shunt.

We present 3 new cases of intraoperative contralateral acute epidural hematoma and review the 14 previously reported cases. The typical clinical presentation is a severe head injury with an acute extraaxial hematoma and severe ipsilateral brain displacement during craniotomy. If brain displacement is not noted at craniotomy, then the contralateral hematoma is manifested by immediate postoperative neurological deterioration or intractable elevated intracranial pressure. The presence of any of these signs makes an immediate postoperative CT scan or burr holes contralateral to the original craniotomy mandatory for early diagnosis. In addition to defining \"intraoperative contralateral epidural hematoma,\" stricter definitions of the terms \"delayed epidural hematoma\" (no hematoma present on the initial CT scan but one present on a later scan) and \"bilateral epidural hematomas\" (present on the initial scan) are proposed.\r"

Multiple pulmonary arteries contained plugs of cerebral tissue, including fragments of cerebral and cerebellar cortex, and white matter. The literature concerning brain tissue emboli is reviewed. In neonates, three patients who survived longer than 1 hour were found to have evidence of persistent hemorrhage. Among both children and adults, our two cases are the only ones reported with associated clotting abnormalities. Brain tissue embolism in neonates occurs after difficult vaginal deliveries, often in conjunction with the use of forceps. Tears of the tentorium cerebelli or falx cerebri have been documented at postmortem examination in the majority of these cases. By contrast, brain tissue embolism in children and adults occurs in association with severe closed or penetrating head injury. In several cases, as in the two reported here, postmortem examination has demonstrated a large cerebral venous defect as the probable site of entry of brain tissue into the systemic circulation.\r"

The pace of such research is accelerating, and most of the published reports have appeared outside the neurosurgical literature. Furthermore, many neurosurgeons may not be sufficiently familiar with the terminology and techniques involved to remain abreast of the field. In this review, we discuss through specific examples of recent work on brain tumors the basic techniques of molecular biology, including the Southern and Northern blots, restriction enzyme digestion of DNA, molecular cloning of genes, and mapping of chromosomal deletions. Gene amplification and rearrangements are discussed through review of recent work on the N-myc gene in neuroblastoma and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in glioblastoma. The molecular cloning of the gli gene from a glioblastoma illustrates the powerful analytic nature of these laboratory techniques and the investigative potential of a cloned gene. The concept of the \"recessive oncogene\" is discussed through a summary of recent work analyzing restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in families of patients with meningioma, acoustic neurinoma, and bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis (BANF; NF-2). Throughout this article, emphasis is placed on ways in which molecular biology may soon affect clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "A helical coil 2450-MHz microwave antenna was used to induce interstitial hyperthermia in normal dog brain. The HCS-10(1)/11 antenna consisted of a miniature semirigid coaxial cable around which a fine wire coil with 10 turns per 1-cm length was wound. A single antenna and two or three temperature probes were implanted stereotactically, and the temperature distributions surrounding the antenna were measured and compared to those induced using a dipole antenna. The helical coil antenna produced well-localized temperature distributions at depths that were symmetrical around the coil and that extended to the antenna tip. There was minimal variation of the heating patterns with insertion depth using the HCS-10(1)/11 antenna and no excessive heating of extracerebral tissues. In contrast, 2450-MHz dipole antennas induced temperatures of 43 to 46 degrees C at the brain surface and extracerebral tissues (skull, muscle, and scalp), with a relatively uniform but lower temperature in the targeted brain volume. One week after hyperthermia treatment, the thermal lesions induced by the helical coil antenna were visualized using computed tomography. The heating patterns correlated well with the location of the heat lesions and were reproducible among animals. The results indicated that the helical coil antenna could be used to induce localized hyperthermia at specific depths in normal brain without inducing unacceptable heating of the brain surface or extracerebral tissues. Consequently, this antenna seems to be suitable for studying the response of normal brain after a heat insult and may be effective in the application of interstitial microwave brain hyperthermia for malignant brain tumors.\r"

Operation was early in 55 good risk patients and late in 57 patients because of poor initial grade, late admission, or logistic reasons. Seventeen patients had no operation because of old age, persistent poor clinical condition, medical complication, or lethal rebleeding before operation. In the total series, 90 patients (59%) made a full recovery, the overall morbidity rate was 14% (21 of 153 cases), and the mortality rate was 27% (42 of 153). Postoperative mortality including emergency evacuation of hematomas was 7.8% and mortality after elective operation was 6.2%. The causes of disability and death were the initial effect of the hemorrhage in 25 patients (16.3%), rebleeding in 15 (9.8%), delayed cerebral infarction in 8 (5.2%), surgical complications in 7 (4.5%), hydrocephalus in 4 (2.6%), and medical complications in 4 (2.6%).\r"

However, the absolute number is increasing. The pathogenesis of KS is still obscure, and its interaction with the human immunodeficiency virus infection remains unclear. Cause of death is usually opportunistic infections in both endemic and epidemic KS. The most common intraoral site is the palate, which is involved in 95% of our cases. The oral cavity may be the only or first site of KS, and therefore, becomes important in the diagnosis. More than 20% of our current patient population had the oral cavity as the initial site of manifestation. Because of functional impairment, bleeding, pain, or cosmetic reasons, treatment is frequently required. There are many modalities used, including chemotherapy, radiation, and laser resection. Radiation appears to be a most effective and practical control measure for oral KS.\r"

The problem is not that teens are sexually active but rather that they have little preparation and guidance in developing responsible sexual behavior. Developmentally, adolescents reach physical maturity before they are cognitively able to appreciate the consequences of their behavior. A teenager's primary source of information regarding sexuality is his or her peer group, all of whom are experiencing and reinforcing the same behaviors. The family, the major socializer of other behaviors, is not as powerful a force in shaping responsible sexual behavior because of parental discomfort with sex education and sexual discussions. This is the result of a social milieu in which sex is frequently portrayed but rarely linked with responsible behavior or accurate, nonjudgmental information. The pediatric practitioner is in an ideal position to intervene in these dynamics. In the office, the practitioner can provide accurate sexual information to both parents and adolescents, support parental-child communication on sexual issues, and provide appropriate services or referral. In the community, the practitioner can advocate for school-based sex education as well as act as an information resource. Finally, the practitioner can advocate for the health care needs for adolescents on a national level, supporting legislation that provides adolescents with information and access to services necessary to make responsible sexual decisions.\r"

Millions of American children have already experienced their parents' divorce and millions more are likely to share the experience in the future. This makes divorce a problem that frequently appears in a pediatrician's patient population. Most children of divorce will experience it at the least as a potent transient stress that disrupts virtually all aspects of their lives. Many will accommodate to their new life circumstances successfully, but a substantial percentage will suffer long-term negative effects. Many of the problems of these children and their families can be anticipated, prevented, or alleviated by thoughtful and timely intervention. The pediatrician can be helpful by serving as the child's advocate, offering anticipatory guidance, helping the family weather the turmoil of the acute stage, screening for maladjustment or maladaptive behavior of children and parents, providing counseling, and referring the children and family for more specialized mental health input when indicated.\r"

Their families face increased risks of marital and economic dysfunction, and siblings too face special tasks living with a chronically ill child. A variety of interventions can help children and families to cope effectively with the tasks of chronic illness. Pediatricians should be alert to effects on the family. Children respond to family stress in very predictable ways. Inasmuch as the stress of chronic illness may affect the marital relationship, there is a likelihood of concurrent behavioral and school problems. Relatively sudden changes in behavior may signal family issues that require professional attention. Drotar et al. maintain that professionals should serve as guides or advocates for children with chronic illness and their families. The relationship that develops between families and professionals is based on trust. They believe that \"trust appears to evolve from the following principles: (1) continuity of relationship, (2) active participation by professional caregivers, (3) mutual participation of child and family, (4) advocacy, (5) a focus on coping and competence, (6) a developmental perspective, and (7) a family-centered focus.\" Cadman et al. identified a similar set of elements that characterizes an efficacious preventive intervention approach. In addition, they propose specific programmatic efforts that are associated with less morbidity. These include ongoing education and counseling for the child, family, and community regarding chronic illness and its management, use of stress management techniques to promote mastery and reduce the impact of stressful life events, and facilitation of social support mechanisms for families with chronically ill children. We have added consideration of the child's performance in school.\r"

  ".W": "With the increasing incidence of substance abuse in the United States, there has been a concomitant increase in the number of women becoming pregnant while using substances of abuse. The infant delivered to a drug-addicted woman is at risk for problems of growth and development as well as neonatal abstinence, and is also at increased risk of infections and exposure to HIV. The long-term outcome of these infants is influenced not only by the mother's use of illicit substances but by the frequent additional use of licit substances, such as cigarettes and alcohol. The drug-seeking environment in which many of these children are raised also may impair maximal development for these infants. In addition, many women from substance-abusing backgrounds lack a proper model for parenting and require intervention by the health care community to guide them in their roles as parents. Thus, multiple factors in the lives of these children, compounded by the early neurobehavioral deficits of drug-exposed newborns, earmark these infants to be at high risk for continuing developmental and later school problems.\r"

  ".W": "Inversion of many predetermined segments of the Escherichia coli chromosome was attempted by using a system for in vivo selection of genomic rearrangements. Two types of constraints on these inversions were observed: (i) a sensitivity to rich medium when the distance between oriC and the 86- to 91-min region (which carries loci essential for transcription and translation) is increased; (ii) a poor viability or inviability of inversions having at least one endpoint in the one-third of the chromosome around replication terminators (with an exception for some inversions ending between these terminators). Although the first constraint is simply explained by a decreased dosage of the region involved, the second one may result from disruption of two long-range chromosomal organizations. The nondivisible zones thus disclosed coincide remarkably well with the two zones that we have previously described, which are polarized with respect to their replication. It is proposed that the two phenomena result from a sequence-dependent and polarized organization of the terminal region of the chromosome, which defines chromosome replication arms and may participate in nucleoid organization.\r"

Four guanine residues present in the nifH upstream activator sequence (UAS), the proposed NifA binding site, were protected from methylation and two guanine residues were hypermethylated when the transcriptional activator protein NifA was present in the cells. The interaction detected at the nifH UAS was independent of the alternative sigma factor NtrA required for transcription of the nifH and other nif promoters. Mutations within the nifH UAS that diminish NifA-dependent transcriptional activation reduced the interaction at the UAS. It seems likely that the pattern of methylation protection observed in the nifH UAS is the result of NifA binding.\r"

To alter the substrate specificity of human lysozyme to be effective on the modified substrate, we replaced the valine-110 residue with various amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis. One of the mutant proteins (valine residue replaced with proline:P110) was secreted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as at least four components (P110-A, P110-B, P110-C, and P110-D) with different specific activities. Two components, P110-B and P110-D, were isolated in a pure form and structurally characterized. The results suggest that this mutation lowered the lytic activity against Micrococcus lysodeikticus by changing a local conformation of the catalytic site while keeping almost the same substrate binding sites. Our results also indicate that cis/trans isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds probably occurs in vivo and that the conformational change of protein as well as point mutations in genes might influence the molecular evolution of the protein.\r"

The added superhelical turns, whose number is proportional to the strength of the promoter and to the length of the transcript, are promptly removed when transcription is turned off. The transcription-induced increase of template supercoiling can still be detected in the presence of an inhibitor of ATP-dependent DNA gyrase [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolyzing), EC 5.99.1.3]. Altogether, our results indicate that, in addition to being under a general control, DNA superhelicity can be modulated locally in response to the topological perturbations associated with DNA tracking processes. We discuss a model in which supercoiling changes are produced by differential swiveling activities on the opposite sides of a transcriptional flow during transcriptional modulation.\r"

The synthetic gene encodes a cysteine-free, bioengineered rIL-6 protein that is expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli as a tripartite fusion protein. Cleavage of the fusion protein with collagenase releases a 23-kDa rIL-6 protein that can be easily purified to homogeneity. We show that the rIL-6 protein displays a range of biological activities similar to those of natural human IL-6, as demonstrated by its ability to (i) protect cells from viral infection, (ii) stimulate the synthesis of fibrinogen in rat FAZA 967 cells, and (iii) induce the terminal differentiation of B cells, resulting in elevated secretion of immunoglobulin.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin receptor with high insulin binding and tyrosine kinase activities has been prepared from human placenta. Based on a molecular mass of 306 kDa for the receptor (the value obtained from the sum of the amino acid residues), this preparation is capable of binding 1.48 mol of insulin per mol of receptor. The receptor is free from phosphatase and ATPase activity and is not stimulated by sodium vanadate. Autophosphorylation is linear with respect to receptor concentration, and the 32P incorporated is stable even in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ATP. The Km for ATP is 208 microM. N-Ethylmaleimide inhibits autophosphorylation. Alkylation with 3H-labeled N-ethylmaleimide results in the incorporation of 1.13 +/- 0.37 mol of N-ethylmaleimide per mol of insulin binding activity exclusively into the beta subunit of the receptor. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate stimulates autophosphorylation of the receptor, an effect that is evident at ATP concentrations below 1 mM. The stimulatory effect of adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate is the result of increasing the binding of insulin to the alpha subunit, and this reflects itself in a shift to the left of the insulin dose-response curve for autophosphorylation. The same is true for ATP. As a consequence, it is now possible to reconcile the concentration of insulin necessary for stimulating the autophosphorylation reaction with physiological levels and with the levels of insulin required for its classical biological effects.\r"

Contraction was induced by incubation of cell models in a solution containing ATP and was assessed quantitatively by measuring alterations of the area of cell model projection on the substrate. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to assess alterations of cytoskeleton morphology in the course of permeabilization and contraction. It was found that contractility of cell models from PMA-treated fibroblasts was considerably diminished as compared with the models from control fibroblasts. ATP induced only local contraction of certain zones of actin cortex in models from PMA-treated fibroblasts; it did not induce general contraction, characteristic of control models. Normal high contractility was characteristic of the models from the cells preincubated with PMA in combination with Colcemid. PMA is a specific activator of protein kinase C, one of the key enzymes of the membrane signal-transduction pathway. It is suggested that protein kinase C regulates contractility of actin cortex and that the pathway of this regulation has a microtubule-dependent stage blocked by Colcemid.\r"

Conversion of either gal operator to a lac operator results in derepression, although both Gal and Lac repressors are present, suggesting that mere occupation of operator sites is not sufficient to cause repression. Conversion of both operators to lac operators restores normal repression in the presence of Lac repressor protein. We propose that normal repression requires interaction between operator-bound like repressor molecules; this generates a DNA loop, which is part of a higher order structure. RNA polymerase and cyclic AMP receptor protein are present in this complex but unable to initiate transcription because of the higher order structure. Such higher order DNA-multiprotein complexes could occur in a variety of genetic regulatory systems that are controlled from distal sites by regulatory proteins.\r"

Cellular genes induced by Tax include those encoding the alpha subunit of the high-affinity interleukin 2 receptor (Tac), interleukin 2, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Tax induction of the interleukin 2 gene is synergistically amplified by mitogens that augment cytoplasmic levels of calcium. These changes in the pattern of cellular gene expression reflect a specific action of Tax, as they are undetectable in isogenically matched control cell lines expressing antisense tax cDNA. The spectrum of cellular genes regulated by Tax appears to be restricted: several other T-cell genes, either inducibly or constitutively expressed, are unaffected by this viral protein. These cell lines constitutively expressing Tax provide valuable reagents to explore the molecular basis for Tax action and to delineate the full spectrum of cellular genes regulated by this retroviral gene product.\r"

Particularly high levels were found in sensory ganglia, sensory nuclei, and motor-related nuclei. The same regions contained high levels of mRNA for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase, a regulated enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. The distribution of low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA was similar in mature and immature rabbits. The data suggest that certain cells in the nervous system have high requirements for cholesterol, which they satisfy through cholesterol synthesis and through receptor-mediated uptake of cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins. The latter originate in astrocytes which synthesize and secrete apoprotein E. These data suggest that the nervous system of mammals contains an active system for continuous redistribution and recycling of cholesterol that is physically distinct from the lipoprotein transport system in plasma.\r"

  ".W": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor, mediates synaptic responses in many regions of the central nervous system. This receptor plays a critical role in the mechanisms of both synaptic plasticity and excitotoxicity. Although these receptors were generally thought to be a single homogeneous receptor population, we report observations indicating that two anatomically distinct forms of the NMDA-receptor complex exist. (i) The distribution of NMDA receptors, as labeled by the NMDA agonist L-[3H]glutamate, differs from that obtained with the radiolabeled antagonist 3H-labeled 3-[(+/-)2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl]propyl-1-phosphonic acid [( 3H]CPP). Relative to L-[3H]glutamate, [3H]CPP binding is low in the striatum and septum and high in the thalamus and inner cerebral cortex. (ii) NMDA antagonists are relatively more potent than agonists at displacing L-[3H]glutamate binding in the thalamus and cerebral cortex; agonists are relatively more potent in the striatum and cerebellum. (iii) Glycine, which potentiates NMDA-receptor responses to glutamate, causes a greater percentage increase in L-[3H]glutamate binding to NMDA receptors in the thalamus and cerebral cortex than in the striatum, septum, and cerebellum. Radiolabeled NMDA-antagonist binding, in contrast, is inhibited by glycine. Thus, as observed for gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors, NMDA receptors have an agonist-preferring binding-site population and an antagonist-preferring binding site population. These may represent two distinct receptors and/or two interconverting forms. It could be of significant clinical importance if these two sites differ in their response to NMDA.\r"

Compound 48/80 and internally applied guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma-S]) induced transient rises in [Ca2+]i and caused membrane capacitance increases as secretion occurred. The 48/80-induced Ca2+ transients and secretory responses were blocked by guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate and neomycin, indicating that inositolphospholipid breakdown mediated by guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein) plays an important role in stimulus-secretion coupling. However, pertussis toxin did not block Ca2+ transients induced by 48/80 or GTP[gamma-S], whereas secretory responses were either abolished (48/80) or developed only after a considerable delay (GTP[gamma-S]). Similar effects were obtained by perfusing cells with cAMP: (i) Ca2+ transients following stimulation with 48/80 remained unaffected by cAMP, but secretory responses were abolished; (ii) GTP[gamma-S] induced normal Ca2+ transients and degranulation in the presence of cAMP. Pretreatment of mast cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) abolished 48/80- and GTP[gamma-S]-induced Ca2+ transients (but not inositol trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ transients), whereas secretion still occurred. At the same time, the Ca2+ requirement for secretion was reduced by PMA. These results indicate that secretion in mast cells is under control of an as yet unidentified signaling pathway that involves a G protein. This pathway is distinct from inositolphospholipid turnover and may provide the triggering mechanism for secretion, whereas the inositolphospholipid pathway serves to increase [Ca2+]i and renders the secretory process more sensitive to [Ca2+]i by activating protein kinase C. Persistent activation of protein kinase C through phorbol ester imposes negative feedback control on the inositolphospholipid pathway, whereas cAMP may inhibit the unidentified signaling pathway.\r"

  ".W": "This paper presents a timely coordinated approach to complete excision of congenital giant pigmented nevi in infancy and early childhood based on a review of 78 patients with giant pigmented nevi of the head and neck, trunk, and/or extremity. Giant pigmented nevi in those selected for review measured from a minimum of 2 percent up to 45 percent total body surface (TBS). Giant nevi of the scalp were treated most effectively using tissue expansion, beginning as early as 3 months of age. Expanded forehead and neck flaps in combination with expanded full-thickness skin grafts were used in early excision of giant pigmented nevi of the face. Giant nevi of the trunk were treated using a combination of abdominoplasty technique, tissue expansion, and split-thickness skin graft, with early \"large segment\" excision and grafting being the most effective treatment of giant nevi covering the posterior trunk. Giant nevi of the extremities were treated most effectively with excision and graft. Expanded full-thickness skin grafts gave excellent coverage on the hands and feet.\r"

Complication rates were lower in patients with one free flap than in patients with two. Flaps had more vascular complications than nonvascular. Accompanying skin islands were found to be necessary to monitor vascularized bone transfers in order to avoid flap failure. Flow in the pedicle was reestablished in all flaps, but a higher percentage of flaps with longer ischemic times were lost. Although vascular compromise occurred frequently (15 percent), prompt surgical exploration and reexploration were thought to have greatly increased free-flap survival.\r"

  ".W": "Photodynamic therapy is a new treatment modality under trial in a number of centers for use in both early and late tumors of the aerodigestive tract, bladder, brain, and skin. The theory behind its application relies on the selective uptake by a tumor bed of a photosensitizing agent such as hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) and subsequent exposure of the tumor-bearing area to coherent laser light of suitable frequency. Following exposure, necrosis of tumor occurs to a variable degree depending on the amount of sensitizing agent absorbed by the tumor, the wavelength of laser light applied, the depth of penetration of light into the tumor, and the quantum of light energy delivered. Lack of controlled clinical data on the use of photodynamic therapy in multiple cancers of the skin led us to perform a pilot clinical study in patients. The results of this study were poor enough for us to abandon, on ethical grounds, a planned full clinical trial of the modality. The results are presented and possible reasons for failure of the method are discussed.\r"

Twenty-two patients were identified of whom 68 per cent had no previous history of diabetes mellitus. The immediate mortality rate (within 72 h of presentation) was 36 per cent (eight of 22), the overall mortality rate was 41 per cent (nine of 22) and vascular thromboembolism was common. A comparison was made of the early deaths (n = 8) and survivors (n = 14) in an attempt to identify favourable prognostic factors. The two groups could not be distinguished either by clinical or laboratory variables at presentation nor by treatment regimen; however there was a significant delay in establishing the diagnosis in some of the patients who died. Our results indicate there has been no improvement in the outcome of the hyperosmolar non-ketotic decompensation syndrome in the last two decades and that a high index of suspicion is required to identify patients presenting with this condition.\r"

The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme contained the sequences of 13 peptides derived from the isolated protein. The cDNA could be transcribed in vitro to yield a synthetic RNA that in cell-free translations produced a protein that coelectrophoresed with the native proteinase and could be immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to this enzyme. The deduced sequence of this proteinase did not contain the consensus sequences for any of the known classes of proteinases (that is, metallo, cysteine, aspartic, or serine), but it did show homology to an Escherichia coli proteinase (called protease III), which also cleaves insulin and is present in the periplasmic space. Thus, these two proteins may be members of a family of proteases that are involved in intercellular peptide signaling.\r"

  ".W": "The rapid induction of the proto-oncogene c-fos by growth factors and other bioactive agents, and the recent evidence that the c-fos protein (Fos) is associated with transcriptional complexes, suggests that Fos may represent an integral part of an intracellular messenger pathway that triggers changes in gene expression and ultimately phenotypic alterations. This report examines the role of c-fos in growth factor stimulation of transin, a matrix-degrading secreted metalloproteinase. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation of transin RNA was blocked by a selective reduction in Fos synthesis with antisense c-fos mRNA, whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation of transin occurred despite an equivalent inhibition of Fos levels. The stimulatory effect of both PDGF and EGF on transin transcription involved factors recognizing the sequence TGAGTCA, which is found in the transin promoter and is reported to be a binding site for the transcriptional factor Jun/AP-1 and for associated Fos and Fos-related complexes. Thus both Fos-dependent and Fos-independent pathways exist for growth factor regulation of gene expression, and both effects may be mediated through the same cis-acting transcription element.\r"

The sequence-specificity of DNA binding was conferred by Zn(II) fingers, whereas a different region of Sp1 appeared to regulate the affinity of DNA binding. The E. coli-synthesized Sp1 was able to stimulate initiation of RNA synthesis in vitro, and at least two distinct segments of the protein contributed to its transcriptional activity.\r"

  ".W": "This article reviews the electroresponsive properties of single neurons in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In some of these cells the ionic conductances responsible for their excitability also endow them with autorhythmic electrical oscillatory properties. Chemical or electrical synaptic contacts between these neurons often result in network oscillations. In such networks, autorhythmic neurons may act as true oscillators (as pacemakers) or as resonators (responding preferentially to certain firing frequencies). Oscillations and resonance in the CNS are proposed to have diverse functional roles, such as (i) determining global functional states (for example, sleep-wakefulness or attention), (ii) timing in motor coordination, and (iii) specifying connectivity during development. Also, oscillation, especially in the thalamo-cortical circuits, may be related to certain neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review proposes that the autorhythmic electrical properties of central neurons and their connectivity form the basis for an intrinsic functional coordinate system that provides internal context to sensory input.\r"

Motors with one torque generator spent more time spinning counterclockwise than did motors with two or more generators. In deletion mutants, stepwise decreases in torque, rare in point mutants, were common. Several cells stopped accelerating after eight steps, suggesting that the maximum complement of torque generators is eight. Each generator appears to contain both MotA and MotB.\r"

  ".W": "The aminoacylation specificity (\"acceptor identity\") of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) has previously been associated with the position of particular nucleotides, as opposed to distinctive elements of three-dimensional structure. The contribution of a G.U wobble pair in the acceptor helix of tRNA(Ala) to acceptor identity was examined with synthetic amber suppressor tRNAs in Escherichia coli. The acceptor identity was not affected by replacing the G.U wobble pair in tRNA(Ala) with a G.A, C.A, or U.U wobble pair. Furthermore, a tRNA(Ala) acceptor identity was conferred on tRNA(Lys) when the same site in the acceptor helix was replaced with any of several wobble pairs. Additional data with tRNA(Ala) show that a substantial acceptor identity was retained when the G.U wobble pair was translocated to another site in the acceptor helix. These results suggest that the G.U wobble pair induces an irregularity in the acceptor helix of tRNA(Ala) to match a complementary structure in the aminoacylating enzyme.\r"

The quisqualate/kainate receptor antagonist DNQX (6,7-dinitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione) blocked 85% of the evoked field potential, leaving a small response that was sensitive to D-AP5 (D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker. This residual D-AP5-sensitive response was of comparable size in control and previously potentiated inputs. High-frequency stimulation in the presence of DNQX did not result in the development of robust LTP. Washout of the drug, however, revealed the potentiation effect. Thus NMDA-mediated responses can induce, but are not greatly affected by, LTP; non-NMDA receptors, conversely, mediate responses that are not needed to elicit LTP but that are required for its expression.\r"

We found a normal response to a standard, short adrenocorticotropic hormone test in 11 consecutive patients with AIDS (P less than .0005). Thus, although adrenal involvement by various destructive lesions may be common in patients with AIDS, clinically significant adrenal insufficiency does not appear to be common.\r"

We found numerous discrepancies between the published protocol and actual practice. Antihypertensive medication was then discontinued in a small subset of the study group, and the diagnosis of hypertension was reevaluated by both JNC criteria and by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. As compared with 24-hour ambulatory measurements, the JNC criteria were ineffective in properly classifying hypertensive status of the patients in this small subset.\r"

  ".U": "89072860\r", 
  ".W": "When alcohol abuse occurs with depression, both the substance abuse and the mood disorder necessitate treatment. These conditions may have some similar manifestations, making differential diagnosis difficult. Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen. Involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram maintenance therapy are other deterrents to drinking relapse.\r"

  ".U": "89072863\r", 
  ".W": "The low incidence of blunt trauma to the cervical portion of the trachea limits management experience in most centers. Hence, we combined our patients with those in published reports containing essential information on injury, treatment, and results. Among 51 patients (93% male), ages ranged from 3 to 65 years. There were 32 complete transections, 15 partial transections, and four tears. There were associated injuries of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (49%), esophagus (21%), larynx (14%), and cervical spine (9%). Presenting signs and symptoms included subcutaneous emphysema in 84%, respiratory distress in 76%, hoarseness/dysphonia in 46%, and hemoptysis in 21%. Tracheostomy was the best means of airway control; 13 of 17 (76%) attempted oral/nasotracheal intubations failed, necessitating emergency tracheostomy. Five patients with no respiratory distress and minimal tissue injury were successfully managed without tracheal repair. Ten patients had tracheal repair without tracheostomy. The only poor result occurred in a patient with a treatment delay of several days. Tracheal repair with tracheostomy was used in 27 patients, with good results in 19. Two patients died of other injuries, and six patients (four with delayed repair) required subsequent tracheal reconstruction. Repair over a stent was used in seven patients, four of whom had satisfactory results. From this review we conclude that (1) the diagnosis of blunt trauma to the cervical trachea requires a high index of suspicion, since this injury can easily be overlooked; (2) tracheostomy (vs intubation or cricothyroidotomy) is the preferred means of airway control; (3) preoperative laryngoscopy/bronchoscopy should be done to assess vocal cord function, possible laryngeal damage, and level of tracheal injury; (4) good long-term results, measured by voice and airway quality, are best obtained by immediate repair of significant injuries.\r"

Specific stains for enolase and S-100 protein clearly demarcated tumor margins after surgical excision. Despite intensive investigation, the histogenesis of this tumor is still in dispute.

Direct acquisition and evaluation of the innominate artery at its origin near the aortic arch enabled separation of it from adjacent arteries and reliable differentiation of stenosis from occlusion. Transcranial recordings from the basal cerebral arteries showed abnormal Doppler signals in 12 patients (86%). Among these abnormalities, observation of a latent steal phenomenon was closely related to the prevalence of cerebrovascular events. This latent steal phenomenon was characterized by a transient reduction of orthograde blood flow in the ipsilateral anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries or in the basilar artery during postischemic hyperemia of the upper extremities. The predictive value of the latent steal phenomenon for the management and follow-up of asymptomatic patients with severe innominate artery obstructions is discussed.\r"

All donor-recipient combinations were at least one-haplotype disparate and 21 were two-haplotype disparate. Presensitization was present in ten patients and attempts at desensitization were uniformly unsuccessful. Of the 151 nonpresensitized patients, transient sensitization occurred in 3% and permanent sensitization in 7%. One hundred thirty-five of 140 nonsensitized patients underwent renal transplantation from the specific blood donor and 56% have never experienced a rejection episode. The allograft survival rate at 2 years (93%) and 7 years (87%) is significantly better (P less than .01) than our historical experience with one-haplotype living-related transplants at 2 years (68%) and 7 years (59%). The low rate of sensitization (7%) has permitted almost all patients to undergo eventual renal transplantation from the specific blood donor. This and the low rate of early rejection (2%) argue for a modification of the immunologic response, perhaps by clonal deletion, rather than a selecting-out process as the mechanism for improved allograft survival.\r"

None of the negative studies has the number of patients necessary to achieve statistical validity.

The direct evidence for induction of Ab-2 to particular donor HLA-specificities by DST is strong; in addition, there is recent evidence for Ab-2 to Ab-1 specific for constant regions of HLA-ABC antigens in the sera of multiply-transfused patients. On the other hand, evidence for induction of anti-TCR antibodies by DST is based primarily on functional specificity rather than biochemical evidence; the evidence available suggests that MLC BF induced by DST may be directed against V beta family or public idiotypes on recipient T cells, since the amount of inhibition obtained is weak and no evidence of \"clonotypic\" antibodies has been found in studies of T cell lines or lymphoblasts. Better molecular probes, including human monoclonal antibodies, T cell clones, and purified TCR are needed to screen for specific anti-idiotypes in transfused patients.\r"

The major types of opportunistic infection to which the renal transplant patient is susceptible are the following: the viruses of the herpes group and papovaviruses; bacteria such as L monocytogenes, N asteroides, and Legionella; such fungi as Candida, Aspergillus, C neoformans, and the Mucoraceae; and protozoans such as P carinii, S stercoralis, and T gondii.\r"
