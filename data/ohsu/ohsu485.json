Just after the turn of the 20th century, a few internships were begun by hospitals in Seattle and Spokane to help with the care of their sicker patients in the tradition of Eastern teaching hospitals. In the 1920s and 1930s, the number of hospitals with internship programs grew steadily as part of a nationwide effort at hospital standardization. Experiences in developing these programs and problems with intern recruitment contributed to the beginning of the University of Washington School of Medicine after World War II. Since the 1960s, intern and resident training has progressively become a cooperative effort of the school with many hospitals and clinics in Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho contributing to the development of graduate medical education in this region.\r"

Cranial sonography was performed during treatment with ECMO, and CT was done 3-14 days after cessation of ECMO bypass. In 66 (45%), intracranial abnormalities were detected with either sonography or CT. Thirty neonates had hemorrhages only, 24 had nonhemorrhagic abnormalities, and 12 had combined lesions. CT provided additional information in 44 (67%) of the 66 neonates. Sonography was normal in 37 neonates, showed fewer lesions in 10 neonates, and was concordant with CT findings in 14 neonates. It cannot be established whether these lesions went undetected with sonography during ECMO, or occurred after cessation of ECMO bypass. Neurodevelopmental evaluation was performed in 71 of 90 survivors 1 year of age or older. Forty-three infants (61%) were normal; developmental delay was suspected in 12 (17%) and present in 16 (23%). The severity of intracranial abnormality as determined by a neuroimaging score correlated well with short-term developmental outcome. Mean neuroimaging scores were significantly higher, with increasing degree of neurodevelopmental delay (p less than .001 by Kruskal-Wallis rank order test). Although cranial sonography remains the primary technique for the detection of life-threatening hemorrhage during ECMO, cranial CT after ECMO is important in defining the total degree of intracranial injury present in these high-risk neonates.\r"

The patients were referred over the last 5 years from the ear, nose, and throat department of our university hospital. Eight-eight percent of the patients had symptoms related to the salivary glands. One hundred fifty-six of the patients (18%) were subsequently proved to be normal. The remaining 693 patients had diseases confirmed by histologic examination (332 patients), sialography (274 patients), or clinical follow-up (87 patients). Of these, 289 had salivary gland tumors (231 benign, 58 malignant), 185 had calculi, 154 had inflammation, 48 had autoimmune disease, 14 had cysts, and three had trauma. Two hundred eighty-seven (95%) of the 302 space-occupying lesions could be completely delineated by sonography, and the benign or malignant nature of the lesions was correctly assessed in 272 (90%). Of the 185 patients with calculi, the calculi were visualized and localized (intraductal vs intraglandular) on the sonograms in 174 (94%) patients. Abscesses were shown on the sonograms in 13 patients, and acute inflammation was shown on the sonograms in 84 patients. These results indicate that sonography is a useful procedure for diagnosis of diseases of the salivary glands.\r"

We therefore retrospectively reviewed clinical, pathologic, and imaging findings in 22 patients with surgically confirmed solitary renal neoplasms that were 3 cm or less in diameter. Eighteen lesions were first found by CT, three by sonography, and one by IV urography. Three lesions were discovered because the patients had hematuria. Nineteen were incidental radiologic diagnoses in patients without renal symptoms. Of 22 neoplasms, 15 (68%) were renal cell carcinomas, six (27%) were oncocytomas, and one (5%) was a lymphoma. Fourteen (93%) of the 15 carcinomas were confined to the kidney, and one showed microscopic capsular invasion. Metastases did not develop in any patient with carcinoma, indicating that small carcinomas usually have good prognoses. Patients with carcinomas had a mean follow-up of 42 months. All neoplasms were visible on CT. However, characterization of these lesions sometimes required a combination of CT and sonography and occasionally angiography. The carcinomas, oncocytomas, and solitary renal lymphoma could not be distinguished radiologically. Small renal neoplasms are most often found incidentally by CT performed in patients without renal complaints. Most are low-stage carcinomas, and some are oncocytomas.\r"

However, viability based on TVS can be assessed more accurately when the exact gestational age from the last menstrual period is known or when the findings are correlated with beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels. No large series has been reported with correlative data between early pregnancy findings, HCG, and gestational age. We performed 75 transvaginal examinations in 53 patients with proved normal pregnancy in the fifth through seventh weeks of gestation. The presence and size of the gestational sac, presence of a yolk sac, and identification of embryonic heart activity were correlated with the level of HCG. Sac size was correlated with yolk sac and heart activity and the three parameters correlated with gestational age in days. When the level of HCG reached 1000 mIU/ml by using the first International Reference Preparation, a gestational sac was seen sonographically in each patient. When the HCG level reached 7200 mIU/ml, a yolk sac was seen in every patient. Ten of 22 patients with HCG between 1000 and 7200 mIU/ml had a visible yolk sac. Every patient with an HCG level greater than 10,800 mIU/ml had a visible embryo with a heartbeat. A discriminatory level of 32 days was found for the presence of a gestational sac. A yolk sac was first seen in every patient between 36 and 40 days. Every patient with accurate dates greater than 40 days had an embryo with a heartbeat identified. When correlating sac size with structures within the sac, a yolk sac was first seen in a gestational sac between 6 and 9 mm and a heartbeat seen in every patient with a 9-mm or greater gestational sac diameter. These data allow identification of normal intrauterine pregnancy and distinction of normal from ectopic gestation at least 1 week earlier than is possible with transabdominal techniques.\r"

The MR findings were compared prospectively in a blinded fashion with the results from double-contrast arthrography in all 38 patients, high-resolution sonography in 23 patients, and surgery in 16 patients. In the total group of 38 patients, MR imaging detected 22 of 22 tears and 14 of 16 intact cuffs as determined by arthrography. In the 16 surgically proved cases, MR and arthrography showed identical results, with 92% sensitivity in the diagnosis of 12 tears and 100% specificity in the diagnosis of four intact cuffs. In a subgroup of 23 patients, sonography detected nine of 15 tears and seven of eight intact cuffs as determined by comparison with arthrography. In 10 surgically proved cases, sonography was 63% sensitive in the diagnosis of eight rotator cuff tears and 50% specific in the diagnosis of two intact cuffs. For the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears, MR imaging is comparable to arthrography in both sensitivity and specificity. In this study, sonography was not as accurate in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears as were the other two techniques. These results suggest that MR imaging should be considered the noninvasive test of choice for patients with suspected rotator cuff disease.\r"

  ".U": "89285192\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of the new antianginal drug, nicorandil, was studied in several models of myocardial ischemia in anesthetized dogs. In animals subjected to an acute or chronic coronary artery occlusion, nicorandil produced increases in collateral perfusion when changes in aortic pressure were minimized. In a model of irreversible ischemia, nicorandil produced a marked (50%) decrease in myocardial infarct size. In several models of reversible ischemia-reperfusion injury, the \"stunned myocardium,\" nicorandil was shown to enhance the recovery of systolic segment shortening after a brief period (15 to 30 minutes) of coronary occlusion. Other vasodilators such as nitroglycerin or nifedipine were not as efficacious as nicorandil. In a model of multiple (n = 3) coronary occlusion (5 minutes) with intermittent (30 minutes) reperfusion, nicorandil improved the recovery of systolic segment shortening during reperfusion and prevented the loss of adenosine triphosphate and tissue edema that occurred in untreated hearts. The beneficial effects of nicorandil on functional and metabolic recovery after recurrent ischemia was shown to be partially the result of an energy-sparing effect of nicorandil to reduce free fatty acid use during the ischemic period. Cyclooxygenase blockade with indomethacin did not block the beneficial effects of nicorandil in the stunned myocardium. These results suggest that nicorandil does not promote an increase of prostacyclin. Finally, nicorandil was found to inhibit superoxide anion production by human neutrophils stimulated by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine plus cytochalasin B. These results suggest that part of the beneficial actions of nicorandil may occur during reperfusion and may be the result of a reduction in oxygen free radical production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nicorandil, a nicotinamide derivative, is a recently developed, orally active antianginal drug with a cardioprotective activity, and its pharmacologic properties differ from those of conventional antianginal drugs. Nicorandil has the capacity to increase myocardial oxygen supply without increasing oxygen demand by reduction in preload and afterload. In isolated blood-perfused canine heart preparations, when injected into the sinus node, the atrioventricular node or the anterior septal arteries, nicorandil at dose levels doubling blood flow through the respective arteries has virtually no effect on sinus rate, atrioventricular conduction time or contractile force of ventricular muscle. This may indicate that nicorandil possesses a selective effect on the coronary vasculature rather than on the myocardium. Furthermore, the vasospasmolytic activity of nicorandil has been evidenced in in vivo and in vitro experiments. The precise mechanism by which nicorandil develops coronary vasodilating and vasospasmolytic effects remains to be elucidated, but it may be partly inferred by an increase in the potassium conductance in the membrane, a relation with cyclic guanosine monophosphate formation, or inhibition of intracellular calcium ion mobilization in the cell of coronary vascular smooth muscle. Nicorandil possesses a nitrate moiety in its chemical structure. However, it is noted that nicorandil unlike nitrates does not develop tolerance or cross tolerance to other conventional nitrates in terms of blood-pressure lowering effects and coronary vasodilating effects. Thus, nicorandil is likely to have highly beneficial properties in the treatment of angina pectoris.\r"

The impact of the drug on left ventricular (LV) hemodynamics and volume during exercise-induced angina was determined by repeating exercise 60 minutes after drug administration, at the same work load that reliably induced angina during control predrug exercise. At rest, nicorandil reduced all components of systemic arterial pressure without change in cardiac or stroke volume indexes or heart rate. Pulmonary artery occluded pressure was reduced without change in LV ejection fraction or systemic vascular resistance index. Effects were evident at 7 minutes and peaked at 30 minutes with attenuation at 60 minutes. Compared with control supine bicycle exercise, the drug (at 60 minutes) reduced mean systemic arterial pressure and LV filling pressure without change in cardiac stroke volume indexes and heart rate. There was a smaller increase in LV ejection fraction. These data suggested greatest impact on LV function during exercise when substantial decreases in filling pressure occurred at maintained cardiac pumping indexes.\r"

  ".W": "Nicorandil is a vasodilator that acts on the venous and arterial beds of the systemic circulation. It reduces both cardiac preload and afterload, as well as improving coronary blood flow. The present study assessed the efficacy, tolerability, duration of action and optimal single dose of nicorandil in patients with stable angina pectoris. Treadmill exercise tests were undertaken by 8 patients at 2 and 6 hours after single oral doses of 20, 40, and 60 mg of nicorandil, and placebo. Doses were administered at weekly intervals in this double-blind, cross-over study. The duration of exercise to onset of angina was increased by 58, 96 and 125 seconds over baseline values (p less than 0.01) with the 20-, 40- and 60-mg doses of nicorandil, respectively. Significant improvement in exercise capacity compared with the effects of placebo was maintained at 6 hours after administration. The antianginal activity was accompanied by a marked reduction in blood pressure both at rest and during exercise, which resulted in severe dizziness and fainting in 2 of 6 patients after the 60-mg dose. However, significant reflex tachycardia occurred only at 2 hours after the 60-mg dose. Plasma concentrations of nicorandil correlated with percent reductions in blood pressure at 2 hours after administration (p less than 0.001) and with increasing total exercise work load (p less than 0.01). The incidence of adverse events appeared to be dose related. Headache and dizziness accounted for most of the reported events. The 20-mg single dose of nicorandil was considered to provide the best combination of antianginal activity and tolerability in this study.\r"

Groups 1 and 2 received nicorandil (5 mg, n = 5; 10 mg, n = 10) twice daily, respectively, increasing to 10 and 20 mg (n = 20) twice daily after 1 week of treatment; group 3 continued to receive placebo. A symptom-limited Bruce protocol exercise test was performed before and 2 hours after the initial dose and, after 2 weeks of treatment, 2 and 12 hours after administration. The following parameters were measured: resting, peak exercise and recovery blood pressure and heart rate, exercise duration, time to onset of angina and time to 1 mm of ST-segment depression. After initial dosing, there were significant increases in exercise duration (16%--n = 5, n = 10 vs -2% [placebo]) and time to onset of angina (20%, n = 5; 26%, n = 10 vs 5% [placebo]) (p less than 0.05). Time to onset of 1 mm of ST-segment depression increased in the nicorandil-treated groups compared with that in the placebo group (27%, n = 5; 25%, n = 10 vs 8% [placebo]). Calculated total exercise work increased in both nicorandil groups compared with exercise work in the placebo group (30%, n = 5; 19%, n = 10 vs 3% [placebo]). A decrease in resting systolic blood pressure (12%) in the 10-mg group was the only significant alteration in the hemodynamic parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nicorandil was compared with placebo, propranolol and low and high doses of diltiazem therapy in 12 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris to elucidate its antianginal mechanism. A computer-assisted treadmill exercise test was performed after administration of either placebo, 30 mg of nicorandil, 40 mg of propranolol, or low-dose 60 and high-dose 120 mg of diltiazem. Exercise duration and time to the onset of ischemia were significantly increased after each drug administration and there was no significant difference in the percent increase in exercise duration between nicorandil (44 +/- 7%), propranolol (47 +/- 11%) and high-dose diltiazem (39 +/- 5%) compared with placebo. Nicorandil increased exercise duration in patients with 1-vessel disease more effectively (7.5 +/- 0.7 minutes, p less than 0.05) than either propranolol or low-dose diltiazem (6.7 +/- 0.7, 6.1 +/- 0.9 minutes, respectively). The decrease in blood pressure obtained with nicorandil was approximately the same as that with diltiazem. Nicorandil increased exercise duration associated with higher peak double product compared with low-dose diltiazem. In contrast, high-dose diltiazem increased exercise duration at the same double product as low-dose diltiazem. Propranolol increased exercise duration at a lower level of peak double product. Because our previous study demonstrated that low-dose diltiazem yielded a plasma concentration high enough to reduce coronary tone, it appears unlikely that nicorandil will reduce coronary tone further and subsequently increased coronary reserve. Therefore, left ventricular preload reduction may be the mechanism responsible for higher values of double product obtained with nicorandil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An eight-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicenter study was conducted. A total of 292 patients were evaluated. Ulcer healing was evaluated by endoscopy and symptom assessment occurred at baseline and at two, four, and eight weeks, or upon symptom worsening as determined by the investigator. Healing was defined as complete re-epithelialization of the crater, without residual erosion. Patients completed eight weeks of treatment regardless of whether or not they were healed at two or four weeks. Treatment groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, ulcer history, cigarette smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption, ulcer size, and ulcer symptoms. Analysis of procedurally correct cases demonstrated that sucralfate suspension was significantly more effective in healing duodenal ulcers than placebo at two, four, and eight weeks. Ulcer-healing rates efficacy analysis are as follows. At two weeks, the healing rate of sucralfate suspension was 22 of 125 patients (18 percent) and the healing rate of placebo suspension was eight of 130 patients (6 percent; p = 0.006). At four weeks, 58 of 114 patients (51 percent) for sucralfate and 38 of 112 patients (34 percent) for placebo (p = 0.011) were healed. At eight weeks, 80 of 105 (76 percent) for sucralfate and 53 of 100 (53 percent) for placebo (p = 0.001) were healed. Sucralfate-treated patients experienced significantly greater reductions in both daytime and nighttime pain scores at two weeks. A significant difference between treatment groups was also found for daytime symptoms at four weeks. At four and eight weeks, patients who smoked cigarettes had significantly lower healing rates than those who did not, regardless of treatment group. Sucralfate suspension was found to be effective for the treatment of active duodenal ulcer.\r"

Both trials demonstrated significantly better ulcer healing at study completion for the 2-g twice daily (B.I.D.) regimen compared with placebo. Both trials were double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled, with parallel groups. Patients received two doses daily consisting of sucralfate 2 g B.I.D., placebo/sucralfate 2 g at bedtime (H.S.), or placebo/placebo. Ulcer healing was assessed by scheduled endoscopy and symptom assessment. Healing was defined as complete absence of erosion or ulceration. Trial 1 evaluations were conducted at four and eight weeks, trial 2 evaluations at two and four weeks. Interim examinations were performed at investigator discretion. Treatment groups were comparable with regard to number of patients, age, sex, smoking status, ulcer size, and presence/absence of baseline symptoms. Sucralfate 2 g B.I.D. was significantly better than H.S. or placebo dosing at the completion of each trial. H.S. dosing was better than placebo only at the four-week analysis of trial 1. At Week 4 of trial 1, 14 of 54 patients (26 percent) were healed with the B.I.D. sucralfate regimen, whereas at Week 8, 41 of 54 (76 percent) were healed (p less than 0.001). For the placebo/sucralfate H.S. group, 17 of 57 patients (30 percent) were healed at Week 4 (p less than 0.05), and 32 of 56 patients (57 percent) were healed at Week 8. For the placebo group, six of 52 (12 percent) and 20 of 51 patients (39 percent) were healed at Weeks 4 and 8, respectively. In trial 2, the B.I.D. group had a 21 percent healing rate at Week 2 (13 of 61 patients) and 62 percent were healed at Week 4 (38 of 61 patients; p less than 0.05). The H.S. group had an 8 percent healing rate (five of 66 patients) at Week 2 and 50 percent (33 of 66 patients) at Week 4. For the placebo group, 10 of 62 patients (16 percent) and 26 of 62 patients (42 percent) were healed at Weeks 2 and 4, respectively. Trial 1 demonstrated significant symptom improvement for active treatment groups at both four and eight weeks, whereas no differences were found in trial 2.

Patients with ulcers less than 3 cm from the pyloric ring and patients with ulcers less than 3 mm in diameter were excluded from the study. Sixty-four patients completed the study. Healing was endoscopically assessed at four-week intervals for 12 weeks. After four, eight, and 12 weeks, the healing rates for cimetidine were 55, 81, and 94 percent, respectively; the healing rates for sucralfate were 52, 79, and 91 percent, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the two regimens. At 12 weeks, the risk of overlooking a difference in favor of one of the two dosage regimens was less than 20 percent.

One hundred eighty-seven patients with gastric ulcer and 480 patients with duodenal ulcer completed the study. Ulcer healing was evaluated endoscopically at six weeks for duodenal ulcer and at eight weeks for gastric ulcer. Patients with unhealed ulcer at this time were assigned to the other therapy for a second period of six or eight weeks of treatment (crossover). In patients with duodenal gastric ulcer, pain relief and healing were not significantly different in the two groups. Eighty-eight percent of duodenal ulcers and 73 percent of gastric ulcers healed with six weeks of sucralfate treatment. Reported side effects and symptoms, pooled together for duodenal and gastric ulcer, were more significant in the sucralfate group (7.5 percent) than in the cimetidine group (3.7 percent). Constipation was the most frequent symptom recorded. In conclusion, sucralfate and cimetidine are both excellent healing agents for short-term treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcer. Both give rapid relief of symptoms without severe side effects.\r"

Meta-analyses show that, whereas cigarette smoking significantly affects duodenal ulcer healing by acid-reducing agents, the healing rates of smokers and non-smokers treated with sucralfate are indistinguishable, suggesting an inherent advantage through the underlying mechanisms of the drug. Pooling reports in the literature indicates that the 12-month relapse curves of duodenal ulcers initially healed with sucralfate and colloidal bismuth subcitrate closely overlap each other and are significantly lower than the curves of the histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists under comparison. A review of the ulcer relapse rates following initial healing in the literature shows that patients receiving acid-reducing agents such as antacids, H2-receptor antagonists, and omeprazole have relapses at similar rates. Use of anticholinergics or non-antisecretory agents including carbenoxolone sodium is associated with a longer remission. Preliminary evidence is available to support the concept that the use of acid-reducing agents results in up-regulation, whereas the use of anticholinergics and non-antisecretory agents is associated with down-regulation of the parietal cells. These changes at the molecular level may help to explain the differences in relapse rates following initial healing with various anti-ulcer agents.\r"

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel groups study. A total of 254 patients with a history of two or more duodenal ulcers, the most recent event diagnosed within three months of study entry, were entered into the trial after healing was documented. Patients received sucralfate 1 g twice daily or placebo for four months, or until recurrence. Endoscopies and symptom assessments were scheduled monthly and at investigator discretion upon symptom development. Treatment groups were comparable with regard to number of patients, age, sex, smoking status, and ulcer history. Traditional ulcer prevalence and point prevalence analyses were performed. Traditional ulcer prevalence included all ulcers found at scheduled visits and interim recurrences. Point prevalence included only ulcers found at scheduled visits. In the traditional analysis, sucralfate was significantly better than placebo in reducing ulcer recurrence for all months of the study. The life table estimate of the cumulative percent with ulcer at four months was 42 percent for the sucralfate group and 63 percent for the placebo group (p = 0.002). At four months, there were 49 recurrences among 122 patients in the sucralfate group and 71 among 117 patients for the placebo group. In the point prevalence analysis, sucralfate was significantly better than placebo in reducing ulcer recurrence at Months 2 through 4. The life table estimate of the cumulative percent with ulcer at four months was 36 percent for the sucralfate group and 55 percent for the placebo group (p = 0.005). At four months, there were 38 recurrences among 114 patients in the sucralfate group and 54 among 104 patients for the placebo group. Both analyses demonstrated that sucralfate 1 g twice daily was significantly better than placebo for the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Symptom development was associated with recurrence in both treatment groups. Smoking was associated with a greater tendency to recur in placebo-treated patients only.\r"

The efficacy of sucralfate has been compared with both placebo and histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists and sucralfate in a dose of 1 g twice a day or 2 g taken at night. It is a safe and effective medication in preventing duodenal ulcer recurrence. However, duodenal ulcer relapse rates always exceed 20 percent and frequently approach 50 percent, whether the therapy be H2-receptor antagonists or sucralfate, and the use of dosages that are half the healing dose seems irrational. It would therefore seem reasonable to continue maintenance therapy at the healing dose, whatever medication is used. Any increased costs for drugs should be outweighed by savings in indirect costs.\r"

Five hundred outpatients with dyspeptic symptoms and endoscopic evidence of chronic nonerosive gastritis were randomly assigned to either treatment for a period of eight weeks. Endoscopic scores were determined at the beginning and at the end of the study. The severity of dyspeptic symptoms was assessed at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Four hundred seventy-three patients completed the study. In 331 cases, biopsies were taken during endoscopy, and a histologic evaluation was also performed, according to Whitehead's criteria. Sucralfate was significantly more effective than ranitidine in inducing healing or improvement of both endoscopic (p less than 0.02) and histologic (p less than 0.001) features. At the end of the study, 77.6 percent of the patients in the sucralfate group and 79.4 percent in the ranitidine group were symptom free. Ranitidine was significantly more efficacious at releiving pain during the first four weeks of therapy. Mild side effects were reported by 4.9 percent of patients treated with sucralfate and by 3.6 percent of patients treated with ranitidine. Treatment was withdrawn in one patient treated with sucralfate because of nausea. In conclusion, sucralfate appears significantly superior to ranitidine in improving endoscopic and histologic aspects of chronic nonerosive gastritis. The symptomatic activity of the two drugs is similar, although more rapid relief is obtained with ranitidine.\r"

Improvement of the activity of gastritis occurred significantly (p less than 0.05) more frequently in the sucralfate (33.3 percent) than in the cimetidine group (18.3 percent), and remained so (p less than 0.05) when only patients with healed ulcer were compared. The density of C. pylori decreased significantly in the sucralfate group after treatment (p less than 0.01) but not in the cimetidine group. The 12-month ulcer relapse rates were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower by life-table analysis in patients healed with sucralfate than in those healed with cimetidine and were unaffected by either the density of Campylobacter in either group or the improvement of the gastritis. It is concluded that sucralfate improves duodenal ulcer-associated antral gastritis and decreases the density of C. pylori, and that factors other than bacterial density and antral gastritis may be responsible for the advantage of sucralfate over cimetidine in ulcer relapse.\r"

A placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design was used to study the capacity of 4 g sucralfate daily to lessen the noxious effect on gastric mucosa of 3.6 g aspirin daily for 14 days. Gastric mucosal injury was assessed by endoscopic scoring of erosions. There was no significant difference in mean erosion scores or the degree of partial mucosal protection between the two groups. It was concluded that sucralfate lacks a mucosal protection capacity at the dosage studied in human subjects ingesting large doses of aspirin over a two-week period.\r"

Patients were randomly given 1 g sucralfate four times a day or the combination of sucralfate 1 g three times a day and 400 mg cimetidine at night. After healing of the esophagitis, patients were randomly given either sucralfate maintenance 2 g daily or placebo for a period of six months. Endoscopy was performed at the beginning of the study, after eight weeks, and, in cases with no healing, after 16 weeks of therapy. Sixty-three of the 70 patients who initially entered the study could be evaluated after eight weeks. Both groups showed good symptomatic improvement, and no side effects necessitated withdrawal of subjects. Endoscopy showed complete healing in 19.4 percent of the sucralfate group and in 21.9 percent of the combination sucralfate and cimetidine group. Endoscopic improvement was found in 50 percent of the sucralfate group and in 50 percent of the combination group. After 16 weeks, 56 patients could be evaluated. In the sucralfate group, improvement was seen in 78.6 percent, and healing in 31 percent. For the combination group these values were 59.3 percent and 37 percent (not significant). Twenty-six patients entered the maintenance phase of the study; 15 received sucralfate and 11 received placebo. Evaluation of 20 patients after six months showed endoscopic and/or symptomatic relapse of esophagitis in three of 12 patients receiving sucralfate and in two of the eight patients receiving placebo. It is concluded that sucralfate monotherapy in patients with reflux-esophagitis is effective and comparable with a combination of sucralfate during the day and cimetidine at night. No difference was found between sucralfate and placebo in terms of the relapse rate of esophagitis during long-term treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional stress bleeding prophylaxis with antacids or histamine (H2)-antagonists, as well as the newer mucosa-protective drugs pirenzepine and sucralfate, are satisfying most of the clinicians with regard to efficacy of stress bleeding prevention. Therefore, potential side effects are attaining crucial importance with regard to the drugs to be used. Pharmacologic blockade of cardiac H2-receptors increases the risk of bradycardia and negative inotropic effects as well as coronary vasoconstriction at least in the presence of elevated plasma histamine levels. Intracardiac injection of pirenzepine can lead to temporary tachycardia. Elderly patients have been shown to be at an increased risk of side effects to the central nervous system when treated with H2-antagonists. These drugs can also induce toxic effects in the liver. Cimetidine leads to interactions with a number of drugs used in the intensive care unit. In patients with pre-existing pulmonary diseases, H2-antagonists have been demonstrated to increase pulmonary bronchoconstriction. Alkalinization of the gastric juice is associated with a significant increase in colonization of gram-negative bacteria in the stomach. In intubated patients, aspiration of stomach contents occurs in 30 to 40 percent of the patients. A number of studies have shown a direct correlation between alkalinization of the gastric juice and pulmonary infections. Sucralfate and to a lesser degree pirenzepine can reduce the risk of pulmonary infections. Sucralfate also exerts a bactericidal effect. Recent investigations support the hypothesis that alkalinization of the stomach also increases the risk of systemic infections. This may be the main reason for the observation that at least in ventilated patients sucralfate, unlike H2-antagonists or antacids, leads to a significant reduction of the mortality rate compared with conventional stress bleeding prophylaxis.\r"

Sixty patients were assigned at random to treatment with either sucralfate (1 g four times per day) or ranitidine (150 mg twice per day). The patients underwent endoscopy before inclusion in the study, after four weeks, and after eight weeks if the ulcers had not completely healed after the fourth week (phase I). Patients whose ulcers had healed were invited to participate in phase II, consisting of maintenance treatment for one year. The dosage was 1 g sucralfate twice per day or 150 mg ranitidine before going to bed. The patients underwent a clinical examination every three months and endoscopy every six months, and whenever symptoms suggested a relapse. After four weeks, the ulcers in 53 percent of the sucralfate-treated patients (16 of 30) had healed, compared with 56 percent of the ranitidine-treated patients (17 of 30). After eight weeks, the cumulative healing rates were 83 percent (25 of 30) and 86 percent (26 of 30), respectively. At the six-month follow-up visit, the relapse rates were seven of 21 (33.3 percent) in the sucralfate group and nine of 18 (50 percent) in the ranitidine group. After 12 months, the accumulative relapse rates were eight of 18 (44.4 percent) and nine of 18 (50.0 percent). The only side effects worth noting were mild constipation in four patients treated with sucralfate. One patient in the ranitidine group had myalgia and one reported headache in phase I. In conclusion, sucralfate appears to be as effective as ranitidine in the short-term treatment of gastric ulcers and in relapse prophylaxis.\r"

Patients with acute uncomplicated duodenal ulcer were randomly assigned to treatment with sucralfate (1 g four times per day) or ranitidine (150 mg twice per day) for four to eight weeks. After healing, all anti-ulcer treatment was discontinued except for low-dose antacids needed for occasional upper abdominal pain, and the patients were observed for up to one year. Endoscopy was repeated after one year or at any time earlier if symptoms suggested ulcer relapse. Of the 83 patients who entered the study, 75 (sucralfate 40, ranitidine 35) underwent endoscopy after four weeks and could be fully evaluated. Healing rates after four and eight weeks were similar in the two groups (four- and eight-week healing rates after sucralfate and ranitidine: 78 and 74 percent, and 95 and 94 percent, respectively). Fifty-three patients with healed ulcers (sucralfate 29, ranitidine 24) were observed for up to one year. Duodenal ulcers occurred somewhat later after sucralfate than after ranitidine treatment, but life table analysis showed no significant difference. Thus, this study confirms a similar efficacy of sucralfate and ranitidine in healing of duodenal ulcer. A tendency to delayed relapse early after discontinuation of sucralfate failed to reach statistical significance.\r"

The authors compared the effects of HP diet to those of normal protein diet (NP) to determine the possible mechanisms by which changes in systemic hemodynamics and hypercalciuria occurred. The studies were conducted in awake rats; the effects of dietary sodium content on the changes induced by HP also were evaluated. The relationship of prostaglandins (PG), renin (PRA), and aldosterone (PA) to changes in blood pressure (BP) was assessed. Two weeks after HP and normal sodium feeding (40%), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urine flow (V) were not different from the same values in a group on an NP diet (23%). When HP was fed with low sodium, there was a rise in V as a consequence of greater fluid intake. Although plasma calcium remained constant, the hypercalciuria correlated with high protein and sodium content. Alterations in 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 or PTH (cyclic AMP excretion) function did not explain the hypercalciuria induced by HP. This suggests that HP leads to inhibition of tubular calcium reabsorption by mechanism(s) yet to be elucidated. Although HP did not alter GFR, it led to an increase in BP, a fall in renal vascular resistance, and an increase in RPF, regardless of sodium intake. PRA and urine PGE2 excretion were significantly higher in the rats on HP diet, whereas PA remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A spontaneous diabetic BB Wistar Rat (SDR) has now been evaluated as a model for insulin-dependent diabetes that more closely reflects this disease in humans. The authors assessed the ability of insulin to stimulate the Vmax of a low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) in adipose tissue of control, streptozotocin diabetic (STZ-DM) rats, and spontaneous diabetic BB rats (SDR). In addition, the authors examined the effect of streptozotocin on the nondiabetic littermates of the SDR animal, the NDR rat. Insulin stimulated Vmax of low Km cAMP PDE in control rat adipose tissue by 20% at 5 minutes. Insulin also stimulated Vmax of both SDR and NDR by 50% at 5 minutes. In contrast to control and both subgroups of the BB rat (SDR and NDR), insulin stimulated adipose tissue from STZ-DM less than 10% at 5 minutes. NDR animals rendered diabetic with streptozotocin were more responsive to insulin. The data demonstrate some similarities and differences between streptozotocin-induced diabetes and spontaneous diabetes in the BB rat. Reduced responsiveness to insulin appears to be more a part characteristic of streptozotocin diabetes than diabetes in the BB rat. The absence of significant insulin resistance in the spontaneous diabetic BB rat also is more consistent with the pathophysiological mechanisms usually seen both in other insulin-dependent diabetic rat models and insulin-dependent diabetes in man. However, both animal models of diabetes, ie, STZ-DM and BB, like man, respond to insulin therapy.\r"

This study was designed to determine the reliability of gram stains, cultures and antibody-coating of bacteria in TA by comparing them with the results of quantitative cultures of specimens obtained by protected brush catheters (PBC) inserted into involved areas of lung parenchyma. Twenty-two patients on mechanical ventilation for at least 72 hours, with new radiographic infiltrates and fever, were studied. Tracheal aspiration was performed in the usual manner using sterile disposable kits. Immediately thereafter, patients underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and PBC-specimens were obtained from the areas of new radiographic infiltrates. Tracheal aspirates were gram stained and cultured aerobically, and antibody coating of bacteria was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Quantitative culture of PBC specimens contained greater than or equal to 10(3) colony forming units per brush in 16 of the 22 patients; a smaller number of organisms was present in two additional patients. In TA from all 22 patients, gram stains revealed polymorphonuclear neutrophils and bacteria. Cultures of TA revealed potential pathogens in 20 patients, and in 15, multiple pathogens were present. The bacteria isolated from PBC also were present in 14 of the 16 patients with greater than or equal to 10(3) CFU in PBC cultures (88%). Antibody coating was present in TA from 12 patients, and antibody coating correlated poorly with cultures of PBC specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When compared with a large series of patients with more \"typical\" Wegener's granulomatosis, patients with alveolar hemorrhage had more evidence of systemic vasculitis and glomerulitis and less evidence of upper airway disease. Alveolar hemorrhage was associated with greater than 50% mortality, reflecting in part, the fulminant nature of this complication of Wegener's granulomatosis. All survivors had been treated with cytotoxic agents; those who died had either no specific therapy or were treated either with corticosteroids alone or died before cytotoxic therapy could be expected to be effective. Wegener's granulomatosis should be in the differential diagnosis for patients who present with alveolar hemorrhage with or without renal failure. An aggressive diagnostic approach and the earliest possible administration of cytotoxic drugs in combination with corticosteroids offer the best chance of survival in this fulminant condition.\r"

Analysis of our clinical and laboratory results and complication rates suggests that first-trimester genetic diagnosis by either chorionic villus sampling or early amniocentesis may be offered to virtually all patients who would be candidates in the midtrimester. We believe that this trend will accelerate, making first-trimester diagnosis the norm, rather than the exception, for the 1990s.\r"

Ovulation was confirmed in all patients with luteal phase progesterone levels and endometrial biopsy specimens. The results demonstrated that transvaginal ultrasonography and urinary luteinizing hormone testing detected ovulation in all cycles. However, the onset of urinary luteinizing hormone occurred after follicle rupture was documented by ultrasonography in 9% of the women studied. Thus the question of accuracy of urinary luteinizing hormone testing in prediction contrasted to detection of ovulation is raised. This observation is of importance in patients in whom prediction of ovulation is critical to treatment management. Therefore, an ultrasonographic examination to confirm the presence of an unruptured follicle on the day of onset of urinary luteinizing hormone surge is recommended, particularly in patients failing to conceive after three to six cycles of artificial insemination when the inseminations are timed with the onset of urinary luteinizing hormone surge.\r"

A continuous-wave Doppler instrument with a 4 MHz transducer was used. The Doppler indices measured were systolic/diastolic ratio, diastolic/average ratio, pulsatility index, and resistance index. The contributions of gestational age, fetal heart rate, location of measurement, interobserver variability, and intraobserver variability on the variance were studied. The investigation demonstrated that the gestational age and fetal heart rate contributed to 33% to 46% and 15% to 18% of the variance, respectively. The location of the Doppler measurement contributed to 29% to 46% of the error variance. Additionally, the interobserver and intraobserver error variance amounted to 10% to 14% and 5% to 9%, respectively. Of these various factors, the interobserver and intraobserver variance were related to the nonhemodynamic phenomena and therefore represented error components. It is obvious that these factors that affect the variance of the Doppler indices should be considered before the diagnostic reliability of this technique can be critically evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "Retrospective data on patients with documented ectopic pregnancies have demonstrated the potential usefulness of serum progesterone in decreasing the time to diagnosis. We report a prospective trial utilizing serum progesterone in the emergency department of a large city-county hospital. Sixty-seven ectopic pregnancies were document in the 582 patients screened; 54 (80.6%) had a progesterone level less than 15 ng/ml. Only one (1.5%) ruptured ectopic pregnancy was associated with a progesterone level greater than 25 ng/ml. There were 387 documented or presumed normal intrauterine pregnancies, 41 (10.6%) had progesterone concentrations of less than 15 ng/ml and 236 (61%) had a progesterone level greater than 25 ng/ml. We decreased minimum time of diagnosis from 48 to 72 hours to less than 24 hours by use of a progesterone screening protocol. During this time the percentage of ruptured ectopic pregnancies decreased from 79.2% to 38.8% (p less than 0.05). Because of its simple interpretation and 24-hour maximum delay, we conclude that the determination of serum progesterone should be used for ectopic pregnancy screening in all patients at risk for ectopic pregnancy, or at any time when the diagnosis is in question.\r"

All patients had their preoperative assessment, operative procedure, and postoperative follow-up managed by the authors. Twelve percent of the patients had one or more previous surgical procedures for urinary incontinence. Sixteen percent of the patients had the preoperative diagnosis of urinary incontinence with mixed components of true stress incontinence and detrusor instability. Postoperatively, 6% of all patients developed evidence of cuff prolapse; 5% had an enterocele. In none of those patients did the defect prolapse to the hymen. Five percent of the patients had postoperative evidence of a persistent cystocele, all of which were smaller than they had been preoperatively. An assessment of the anatomic results of the repair demonstrates that meticulous attention must be paid to the proper repair of the paravesical defect, to support of the vaginal cuff, and to management of the cul-de-sac of Douglas to minimize postoperative anatomic defects. Ninety-seven percent of patients had excellent functional results with no postoperative complaints of stress urinary incontinence.\r"

Plasma levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol fractions were obtained before, during, and 1 month after treatment. High-density lipoprotein2 and high-density lipoprotein3 cholesterol concentrations were measured in selected patients. Body weight was also followed. The drugs were equally effective in achieving symptomatic relief and laparoscopically demonstrated resolution of endometriosis but differed significantly in their effects on lipid concentrations. Nafarelin acetate had no adverse effects on serum lipoprotein concentrations, whereas danazol significantly decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p less than 0.01), as well as the high-density lipoprotein2 subfraction (p less than 0.05), and increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p less than 0.01). Danazol significantly increased body weight (p less than 0.01), whereas nafarelin did not.\r"

A study was undertaken to determine whether the vaginal apex pulse recording equals the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the uterine artery Doppler velocimetry, and whether abnormal uterine artery wave forms are fixed. The vaginal apex recordings had greater sensitivity to abnormal outcome than did the uterine artery Doppler technique. The vaginal apex pulse height decreased significantly in a majority of the women undergoing elective cesarean section and during uterine contractions. In patients with abnormal wave forms (diastolic notches) and treated with either terbutaline sulfate or magnesium sulfate, the diastolic notch disappeared in eight out of 14 cases.\r"

Four of this group had microscopic evidence of pericarditis on postmortem examination. Fetal pericardial effusions are always a manifestation of another disease process often presenting as fetal hydrops. Some pericardial effusions are transient.

A telephone survey of 1,866 ingestion incidents reported to nine poison control centers was conducted in the spring of 1986. Accidental ingestion occurred most often with a two-year-old child (42 per cent) in their own home (82 per cent). Thirty-five per cent of the toxic drugs ingested at home belonged to someone other than the immediate family, most often a grandparent. Toxic drugs were more often out of their usual storage location and in non-child-resistant prescription packaging, a nonprescription container, or in no container. Twenty-two per cent of all child-resistant packages were non-functional. Overall, at least 61 per cent of all medications had no child-resistant barrier at the time of ingestion. Accessible storage locations such as the kitchen counter, table top, or top of a dresser or bedside table greatly increased the risk of accidental ingestion. These results suggest the need for effective child-resistant packaging that is easier for all adults to use.\r"

Given the complexity of human behavior and the reality of a still uncontrolled epidemic, at least among poor urban drug using minorities, there is a legitimate role for most approaches and any promising behavior modification strategy deserves evaluation. However, because voluntarism will not work for some individuals, society still must choose between effective public health law--including restrictive measures--now, and a much larger reservoir of HIV infection and more deaths from AIDS for many generations to come.\r"

An additional three of the 16 patients showed right atrial enlargement and right-to-left deviation of the interatrial septum. Two patients showed evidence of paradoxical embolization (one of whom had right ventricular and right atrial enlargement), and a third patient (who had right atrial enlargement) embolized a large right atrial thrombus into the pulmonary circulation. Two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated that isolated right ventricular failure might account for some of the hemodynamic instability seen during liver transplantation. Venous, pulmonary, and paradoxical embolization of air and thrombi documented by transesophageal echocardiography likely contribute to right heart failure.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandom prospective trial with endpoints of tumor response, results of repeat surgical exploration, progression-free interval, and survival. SETTING: Cooperative university-based cancer study comprising 27 participating institutions. PATIENTS: Ninety-seven patients were treated and all were evaluable. Of these, 8 had dysgerminoma and 89 had other cell types. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received 3 to 4 courses of cisplatin. vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB). After chemotherapy, suitable patients had re-staging laparotomy. Maintenance vinblastine therapy was originally given but was discontinued for all patients in 1981. Patients with persistent or recurrent disease were treated with vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) or etoposide plus cisplatin (EP). RESULTS: Of 35 patients with tumors other than dysgerminoma who had clinically measurable disease, 15 (43%; CI, 26% to 61%) had complete responses. Forty of fifty-six second-look laparotomies (71%; CI, 58% to 83%) revealed no tumor or mature teratoma. Forty-seven patients are still disease-free and 59 are alive. The survival rate is 71% (CI, 62% to 89%) and the disease-free rate is 51% (CI, 41% to 62%) at 2 years. Eight patients had durable remissions with second- or third-line therapy. Seven of eight patients with dysgerminoma are also disease-free. CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is effective for patients with ovarian germ-cell tumors, is superior to previous regimens, and will cure a substantial number of patients.\r"

DESIGN: Blind analysis of serum samples, retrospective analysis of clinical data on patients, and prospective follow-up of a subgroup of patients with Wegener granulomatosis. PATIENTS: The study included 277 patients with Wegener granulomatosis (222 with biopsy-proven disease) and 1657 control patients. SETTING: University hospital and academic medical center. LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS: Analysis of 2653 serum samples from 1934 patients for ACPA. Antibody detection was by indirect immunofluorescence and a new type of enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). Prospective follow-up was on 172 patients with Wegener granulomatosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Specificity of ACPA for Wegener granulomatosis measured by indirect immunofluorescence was 99% (CI, 98.9% to 99.7%) and 98% (CI, 97.4% to 99.2%) by ELISA. Sensitivity of ACPA depended on disease activity and extent: It was 67% (CI, 38% to 89%) by immunofluorescence and 60% (CI, 32% to 84%) by ELISA for patients with active locoregional symptomatology (n = 15); and 32% (CI, 14% to 54%) by immunofluorescence and 40% (CI, 21% to 61%) by ELISA for patients in full remission after initial locoregional symptoms (n = 25). The sensitivity was 96% (CI, 89% to 99%) by immunofluorescence and 93% (CI, 86% to 98%) by ELISA for patients with active generalized disease (n = 92). Serial testing was done; every patient with active generalized disease eventually had at least one positive serum sample. Sensitivity decreased to 41% (CI, 22% to 62%) by both immunofluorescence and ELISA for patients in full remission after active generalized disease (n = 27). Levels of ACPA expressed both as immunofluorescence titers and ELISA values (U/mL) correlated well with disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for ACPA in serum of patients with Wegener granulomatosis is valuable for differential diagnosis; furthermore, APCA can be used as a marker to follow disease activity. A new type of ELISA yielded the same results as indirect immunofluorescence for the specificity, sensitivity, and correlation with disease activity of ACPA.\r"

  ".W": "Barriers frequently develop in physician-patient encounters. If they go unrecognized, they can severely limit the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Because barriers are not always explicit, a strategy is presented for recognizing implicit signs such as verbal-nonverbal mismatch, cognitive dissonance, unexpected resistance, and physician discomfort. Once a potential barrier is identified, its source can be defined and explored using standard clinical reasoning techniques such as hypothesis generation and testing. Patients can often share in the process of generating hypotheses about the nature and sources of barriers. Once defined and understood, most barriers can be lessened and sometimes resolved using the basic communication skills of acknowledgment, exploration, empathy, and legitimation. When conflict exists, common interests and differences must be clarified. Conflict might involve disagreement about the presence of a barrier, its nature or source, its relevance to the physician-patient relationship, or about strategies for approaching it. Negotiation need not be limited to the initial positions, but can include creative solutions whereby both parties gain. The decision to confront a barrier depends on both doctor and patient readiness, as well as how critical the barrier is to the therapeutic process, and how amenable it is to change. By effectively uncovering and addressing barriers, the physician can often turn roadblocks to effective communication into means for enhancing the therapeutic relationship.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that influence the rate of healing of duodenal ulcers. DESIGN: A stepwise multivariable statistical analysis of patients with duodenal ulcer in a multicenter, prospective, open-label study. Healing was assessed by endoscopy at 4 or 8 weeks. Antacid use and symptoms were recorded in a daily diary. SUBJECTS: Of 135 patients, ages 19 to 86, 50% had a previous duodenal ulcer, 46.7% smoked, and 34.8% had melena or hematemesis. INTERVENTIONS: Famotidine, 40 mg orally, at bedtime for 4 or 8 weeks depending on endoscopic evaluation of ulcer healing. Limited antacid use was permitted. SETTING: Office practices, hospital practices, and university-based medical centers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multivariable analysis identified five independent predictors present at the time of diagnosis that influenced ulcer healing. The odds of not healing for each risk factor after simultaneous adjustment of the other risk factors were as follows: alcohol use, 6.5 (CI, 2.0 to 20.7, P less than 0.002); ulcer size greater than 10 mm, 4.2 (CI, 1.5 to 11.6, P less than 0.005), bleeding symptoms. 3.5 (CI, 1.2 to 10.2, P less than 0.03); and a previous duodenal ulcer, 3.1 (CI, 1.05 to 9.0, P less than 0.04). The use of salicylates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs before treatment was associated with an improved odds of healing (adjusted odds ratio, 0.2; CI, 0.1 to 0.9, P less than 0.04). The percentage of patients achieving complete ulcer healing after 4 weeks of famotidine decreased inversely with the number of risk factors present, ulcer size, and the quantity of daily alcohol use (P less than 0.001). Fewer than half of those patients who still had severe pain at day 7 achieved healing at 4 weeks (P less than 0.001). In contrast, smoking and 23 other factors had no statistically discernible effect on ulcer healing with famotidine. CONCLUSIONS: Five variables present at the time of diagnosis independently influenced the rate of ulcer healing at 4 weeks: alcohol use, ulcer size, bleeding symptoms, a previous duodenal ulcer, and previous use of salicylates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\r"

We employed data from seven published studies to demonstrate how ROC analysis may be used to characterize the discriminative properties of the dexamethasone suppression test (DST). We also used an intrinsic property of test results--their ability to reduce diagnostic uncertainty--to select cortisol cutoff levels with the highest information content for each of the DST studies. These cutoffs often differ from original authors' definitions of nonsuppression. The information-maximizing cortisol levels vary depending on pretest estimates of the prevalence of depression or melancholia and vary among studies. Receiver operating characteristic analytic techniques provide important tools for a full description of the DST. Future studies should use receiver operating characteristic methods to select cortisol cutoffs and to assess the test's overall performance.\r"

The pathophysiology is uncertain but is probably due, at least in part, to hydrostatic and capillary permeability abnormalities of the pulmonary vascular bed in response to hypobaric hypoxia. A subclinical form above 14,000 ft is common (15% to 23% incidence), but the incidence of HAPE itself is unclear. Possible risk factors include rapid ascent, strenuous activity on arrival, reascent to altitude by highlanders after a short stay lower, previous HAPE, cold, respiratory tract infections, sedation, youth, and the peripheral edema of AMS. Clinical presentation is similar to that of pneumonia: tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, cough, fever, and chest discomfort. Symptoms often worsen with sleep. WBC count is usually elevated, and arterial blood gases reveal a respiratory alkalosis and an alarmingly low hemoglobin saturation. Chest radiographs reveal bilateral patchy infiltrates. Radiographic findings are dissimilar to those from cardiogenic PE. Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, PE and HAB. Treatment modalities include early descent, bed rest, oxygen therapy, and EPAP. Mortalities range from 4% to 27% depending on the rapidity of descent and evacuation.\r"

This study reports the results of 78 patients who were successfully treated over 6 years by submalar augmentation. This procedure consists of inserting newly designed Silastic (silicone rubber) implants over the midface to create the appearance of restoring the vibrant and youthful fullness of the middle third of the face while avoiding distortion of normal facial anatomy. When used alone, it provides an alternative to rhytidectomy in the 38- to 50-year age group. The benefits of submalar augmentation are such that it should be considered a standard part of the surgical approach to facial rejuvenation.\r"

  ".U": "89287052\r", 
  ".W": "Eleven patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction with A-O plates were followed up for as long as 40 months. The patients underwent either immediate or delayed mandibular reconstruction. Nine patients had free cortical bone grafts included in the reconstruction. Complications in patients who underwent immediate reconstruction included loss of the bone graft due to infection, external and intraoral exposure of the reconstruction plate, pain, and infection. In the patients with immediate reconstruction, more than 50% of the bone grafts resorbed. There were less complications and minimal bone graft resorption in patients who underwent delayed reconstruction. The cosmetic results were initially good in both immediate and delayed reconstruction but deteriorated as more surgery was required for management of complications. At 40 months, 7 of 11 patients (5 of 9 with immediate reconstruction) had died of local recurrence, distant metastasis, or another primary tumor. No patients were rehabilitated prosthetically. We conclude that while A-O plating is technically easy and has a low perioperative morbidity rate, the long-term morbidity rate is high. This must be weighed against the benefits of the procedure and the probability that the patients will have a poor functional outcome.\r"

This study has used a group of 175 patients on a phase 3 Southwest Oncology Group trial for resectable advanced stage disease to test this hypothesis. In the group that failed, 52% of the standard group failed at distant sites as opposed to only 30% of the experimental group. This difference approaches statistical significance. These findings suggest that chemotherapy, although demonstrating some activity against microscopic distant disease, has not substantially altered the usual patterns of treatment failure for head and neck cancer. However, the assumption that the clinical responses noted with chemotherapy are having a positive influence on the frequency of occult distant disease was supported by our results.\r"

About 20% of patients with acute non-Q wave myocardial infarction did not have definable ST-T wave abnormalities.

We therefore carried out studies using a phantom assembly to simulate thyroid and parathyroid in the neck, containing activities of 99Tcm and 201Tl similar to those likely to be present in patient imaging. An initial study of imaging protocol confirmed that correction for scatter from 99Tcm in the 201Tl window usefully improved the image. After making a preliminary selection of gamma cameras and collimators it was found that the GE Maxicamera 400T just visualized the 0.3 g \"parathyroid\" in a 5 min image with the pinhole collimator and 6 mm insert (A). It performed slightly less well with the HR converging collimator (B) and only marginally better with the 4 mm insert (C), but this is unduly slow unless it is placed close enough to limit the field of view unacceptably. The Siemens Orbiter 75 ZLC with special thyroid collimator (D) gave results similar to (A), is convenient for positioning the patient and is very suitable for parathyroid imaging.\r"

There is now a growing body of evidence from prospective randomized clinical trials to support the role of adjuvant therapy for patients whose primary tumour has spread through the rectal wall or has associated lymph node involvement. Carefully planned radiation therapy with adequate doses and fields can reduce the risk of locoregional failure. Chemotherapeutic agents delivered either systemically or regionally may also contribute to better disease control and survival. A number of diagnostic and therapeutic issues still need to be addressed in order to use the available adjuvant treatment methods most appropriately. Efforts to refine patient selection, to enhance therapeutic effect and to minimize toxicity are likely to improve the outlook for patients with resectable rectal cancer.\r"

An attendance rate of 76 per cent was achieved (906 patients). Seventy-one patients (7.8 per cent) were found to have aortic diameters greater than 2.5 cm and 14 (1.5 per cent) had aortic diameters greater than 4.0 cm. Aneurysms were more common in smokers and in hypertensive patients. However, restriction of screening to patients with these risk factors would have led to a number of aneurysms remaining undiscovered. We recommend therefore that ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms should be offered to all men between the ages of 65 and 74 years.\r"

We have routinely used a single-layer continuous suture technique with an absorbable suture material (polyglycolic acid) to construct all recent intraperitoneal bowel anastomoses, and we present a 3-year audit of this technique. A total of 131 patients were studied of whom 66 had undergone upper gastrointestinal resections and 65 had had colonic resections. Twenty-two patients had emergency operations. Anastomotic failure was noted in 4.5 and 6.2 per cent of patients in each group respectively. The incidence of minor wound infection was 1.5 and 7.7 per cent respectively. The overall mortality rate was 8.4 per cent. This study suggests that a single-layer continuous suture technique gives acceptably reliable results when used in gastrointestinal anastomosis.\r"

In a pilot study, the first 20 patients were given hepatic artery infusions of FUDR by implanted pumps. The remaining 44 patients were then randomized prospectively to compare the effectiveness of continuous hepatic artery and intravenous infusion of FUDR (IA/IV group; 21 patients) with hepatic artery infusion alone (IA group; 23 patients). A continuous 14-day infusion regimen of FUDR was applied each month. The dosage was 0.2 mg/kg/d of FUDR for the IA group and 0.3 mg/kg/d for the IA/IV group. The complete and partial response rates were each 50% in the pilot study and 52% and 48% in the IA and IA/IV randomized groups, respectively. Drug toxicities in the 64 patients included gastroenteritis (21%), chemical hepatitis (57%), and biliary sclerosis (25%). There was no difference in the toxicity of FUDR in the two randomized groups (P greater than 0.1). Extrahepatic spread of cancer during therapy was found in 61% (n = 14) of the IA group and 33% (n = 7) of the IA/IV group. There was no difference in survival between the randomized groups. The 64 patients were categorized into the following two groups according to their response to therapy: (1) responders (patients with complete or partial remission [n = 32]) or nonresponders (patients with stable disease or progression of metastases [n = 32]). The median survival time was 31 months for responders and 16 months for nonresponders (P less than 0.0001). Intraarterial FUDR infusion provided control of liver metastases. The combination of intraarterial and intravenous therapy seemed to prevent extrahepatic spread during therapy in most of the patients. Survival appeared to be significantly prolonged in patients with a regression of metastases.\r"

The authors recommend several modifications of existing terminology and definitional criteria for these lesions. Because MLC probably represents a neoplastic lesion, the designation \"cystic nephroma\" (CN) is preferred. This term should be used only for predominantly cystic tumors composed entirely of differentiated tissues, without blastema or other embryonal elements. The designation CPDN should be applied to predominantly cystic lesions, lacking nodular solid regions, in which blastemal or other embryonal cells are present in the septa of the cysts. Solid Wilms' tumor with multifocal cystic change should be distinguished from CPDN. Five cases of CN and 18 cases of CPDN were reviewed. No CN, for which follow-up data was available, showed aggressive behavior. Only one case of CPDN underwent local recurrence, and there were no metastases. In general, nephrectomy alone appears to be adequate therapy for CPDN, but regular monitoring by noninvasive techniques would seem advisable.\r"

  ".W": "When exposed to an increasing transmural pressure, middle cerebral arteries of the cat exhibit reduction of internal diameter which is mediated by vascular muscle cell depolarization. This laboratory has recently demonstrated that this \"pressure-induced\" activation is dependent upon the presence of an intact endothelium. The present studies were undertaken to determine if this phenomenon is due to inhibition of tonically released endothelium-derived relaxing factors (EDRF) or release of a contractile substance. When cerebral arterial segments were pressurized to between 40 and 160 mm Hg there was 13.2% reduction in internal diameter accompanied by significant muscle cell depolarization from -53 +/- 2.7 to -22 +/- 1.4 mV. There was a significant positive correlation between the delta Em and step increases in transmural pressure. These excitatory responses were lost and vessels dilated to pressure when the endothelium was removed. Upon exposing the denuded vessel to a pressurized intact donor, the denuded vessel recovered its ability to contract and depolarize suggesting that a contractile substance might be released from the vascular endothelium upon pressurization. The EDRF antagonist oxyhemoglobin did not alter the excitatory response to pressure in these isolated cerebral arteries further suggesting that the reduction in diameter and muscle cell depolarization results from the release of a contractile substance from the vascular endothelium and not inhibition of EDRF.\r"

Endothelial injury or dysfunction may play an important role in the spasmogenicity of the coronary artery, although other possible alterations related to atherosclerosis should also be considered. Among the possible stimuli, aggregating platelets are important as a source of vasoconstrictor substances. The endothelium may also produce the vasoactive substances EDHF and EDCF(s). Their pathophysiologic significance remains to be determined.\r"

Smoking history was obtained in 1975, 1981, and 1986. The mean life-long smoking dose of the smoking cotwins was 20 package-years. The smoking and nonsmoking cotwins had similar systolic and diastolic blood pressures, total plasma cholesterol level, body mass index, and some psychosocial factors; the only difference was found in use of alcohol, which was greater among smoking cotwins. Duplex sonography of carotid arteries was performed. Carotid artery stenoses (narrowing of area of the lumen with 15-60%) were found in nine pairs: in nine smoking twins and in two of their nonsmoking cotwins (p = 0.036). The total area of carotid plaques was 3.2 times larger in smoking cotwins (p less than 0.001). The thickness of the inner layer of carotid arteries was more marked in smoking cotwins (p less than 0.001). The size of plaques and the degree of inner layer thickening correlated with the dose of smoking (NS). The association of smoking with carotid arteriosclerosis was highly significant even after the adjustment for age, total plasma cholesterol level, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index in multiple logistic regression analyses.\r"

  ".U": "89288605\r", 
  ".W": "We have speculated previously that the abrupt conversion from chronic stable to unstable angina and the continuum to acute myocardial infarction may result from myocardial ischemia caused by progressive platelet aggregation and dynamic vasoconstriction themselves caused by local increases in thromboxane and serotonin at sites of coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury. Platelet aggregation and dynamic coronary artery vasoconstriction probably result from the local accumulation of thromboxane and serotonin and also relative decreases in the local concentrations of endothelially derived vasodilators and inhibitors of platelet aggregation, such as endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and prostacyclin. With severe reductions in coronary blood flow caused by these mechanisms, platelet aggregates may increase, and an occlusive thrombus composed of platelets and white and red blood cells in a fibrin mesh may develop. When coronary arteries are occluded or narrowed for a sufficient period of time by these mechanisms, myocardial necrosis, electrical instability, or sudden death may occur. We believe that unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction are a continuum in relation to the process of coronary artery thrombosis and vasoconstriction. When the period of platelet aggregation or dynamic vasoconstriction at sites of endothelial injury and coronary artery stenosis is brief, unstable angina or non-Q wave infarction may occur. However, when the coronary artery obstruction by these mechanisms is prolonged for several hours, Q wave myocardial infarction results. Chronic endothelial injury and coronary artery stenosis are probably associated with the accumulation of platelets, white and red blood cells, and a fibrin mesh at the site of stenosis and endothelial injury.\r"

  ".W": "The prevention of cardiovascular disease antedates our current preoccupation with risk factors for coronary heart disease and hypertension. Indeed, earlier preventive efforts have in part been so successful that many people have forgotten that they existed. The almost forgotten entity, beriberi heart disease, was first prevented in 1883 by Takaki of Japan. With diphtheria, it was the identification of the causative bacillus by Klebs in 1883, leading finally to the development of diphtheria toxoid by Ramon in 1923, which resulted in the disappearance of diphtheritic heart disease. Success in the attack on syphilitic heart and vascular disease began with Bordet and Gengou in 1901 with the discovery of the phenomenon of complement fixation, and with the formulation of Salvarsan by Ehrlich in 1907. The story of the prevention of rheumatic fever has a large cast of characters, but special recognition must be given to Coburn for his observations confirming the role of the hemolytic streptococcus published in 1931 and showing the prophylactic value of sulfanilamide published in 1939. The important association of maternal rubella with congenital heart malformations was revealed by Gregg in 1941. Alcoholic heart disease was identified particularly by Brigden and Evans in 1957 and 1959, respectively. In relation to coronary and hypertensive heart disease, the names of Anitschkow (1933), Leary (1935), and Keys (1948) in relation to diet, of Freis (1967) in the field of hypertension treatment, of White (1927) in relation to physical exercise, and of English, Willius, and Berkson (1940) and Hammond and Horn (1954) in the role of cigarette smoking, deserve special recognition.\r"

These reports involved 24,074 patients who underwent both tests. Population characteristics and technical and methodologic factors, including publication year, number of electrocardiographic leads, exercise protocol, use of hyperventilation, definition of an abnormal ST response, exclusion of certain subgroups, and blinding of test interpretation were analyzed. Wide variability in sensitivity and specificity was found (mean sensitivity, 68%; range, 23-100%; SD, 16%; and mean specificity, 77%; range, 17-100%; SD, 17%). The four study characteristics found to be significantly and independently related to sensitivity were the treatment of equivocal test results, comparison with a \"better\" test such as thallium scintigraphy, exclusion of patients on digitalis, and publication year. The four variables found to be significantly and independently related to specificity were the treatment of upsloping ST depressions, the exclusion of subjects with prior infarction or left bundle branch block, and the use of preexercise hyperventilation. Stepwise linear regression explained less than 35% of the variance in sensitivities and specificities reported in the 147 publications. There is wide variability in the reported accuracy of the exercise electrocardiogram. This variability is not explained by information reported in the medical literature.\r"

The placebo treatment had to be withdrawn before 48 weeks in 9 out of 19 patients because of a deterioration of their arthritis symptoms. All 20 patients in the CyA group completed 26 weeks of treatment. Fourteen of them were followed up for 48 weeks of treatment on CyA and then 12 weeks after CyA treatment was withdrawn. The side effects in the CyA group were compared with the results from another study with high CyA doses (mean whole blood CyA level 419 +/- 71 micrograms/l) for 26 weeks in 11 other patients with RA. Serum creatinine increased 19.7% (p less than 0.01) in the low CyA dose group after 26 weeks as compared with 59.5% in the high CyA dose group. Creatinine clearance was reduced by 17.9% (low dose) (p less than 0.01) and 26.2% (high dose), respectively. Twelve weeks after withdrawal of the low dose CyA treatment, serum creatinine values were still higher than before treatment (p less than 0.05), but creatinine clearance had normalized. Eight of the 20 patients treated with low CyA doses also started with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after 20-36 weeks of CyA treatment. Serum creatinine was 16.6% above baseline 4 weeks before NSAIDs compared with an increase of 40.4% (p less than 0.05) 4 weeks after start of NSAID treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In most cases, the therapeutic agent chosen should be much the same as that in the nonpregnant patient, and an understanding of the pharmacology of the antiarrhythmic agents is necessary for rational use in the pregnant patient with an arrhythmia. Substantial experience has been accumulated using some of the older agents for treatment of arrhythmias in pregnancy. As newer agents become available, there may be indications for their use in pregnancy; however, we recommend initially using well-known drugs until more experience is gained with the newer ones. The choice of an agent should be made only after thorough evaluation of the patient's symptoms, accurate diagnosis and an analysis of potential benefit versus potential risk to the mother or fetus.\r"

Hemolytic disease is the most common associated condition in our series (46%) as well as in the literature (30%), but the frequency of the various associated conditions varies with age. Isolated gallstone disease does occur, particularly in the young infant. Jaundice is the most common symptom in children less than 1 year of age, being present in greater than 90 percent of symptomatic patients previously reported. Overall, the most common symptom in our series is vomiting (60%). Right upper quadrant pain in the absence of vomiting does not appear to be significant, as this occurred in only one patient (3%) in our series.\r"

The appropriate interpretation of thyroid function tests is also important because associated nonthyroidal disorders and the drugs used for their management in the elderly often alter test results, even in a euthyroid subject. Finally, therapy must be prompt but cautious, with closer and more frequent monitoring than is necessary for younger patients.\r"

Alcohol causes unique kinds of brain damage, a fact that may aggravate the clinical symptoms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease, but there is no convincing proof of premature aging because of alcohol abuse. Alcohol potentiates the sedating effects of many drugs acting on the CNS. This is especially serious in elderly patients, and they should be cautioned concerning the use of alcohol and drugs.\r"

From these curves, Paw and Palv were determined. In all groups, Paw proved to be a precise estimator of Palv during volume-regulated, time-cycled, continuous positive-pressure breathing.\r"

At 30 days postinfusion, 30 PGE1 and 24 placebo patients had died. Total deaths judged to be related to the syndrome were 32 and 28 in the PGE1 and placebo groups respectively at six months. We conclude that PGE1 did not enhance survival in patients with established ARDS. PGE1 augmented the hyperdynamic circulation of these patients by reducing systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, which resulted in a reduction of blood pressures and increased stroke volume, cardiac output, and heart rate. An improvement in oxygen availability and oxygen consumption was observed with PGE1 therapy. PGE1 was associated with an increased incidence of diarrhea (six patients in the PGE1 group vs one in the placebo group, p less than 0.05). Other adverse effects included hypotension (ten patients in the PGE1 group vs seven in the placebo group), fever (six patients in the PGE1 group vs three in the placebo group), and non-fatal dysrhythmias (ten in the PGE1 group vs five in the placebo group).\r"

  ".W": "Growth and division of type II pulmonary epithelial cells are important components of the pathway by which the alveolar surface is repaired following several forms of lung injury. These processes, which result in reepithelialization of the denuded alveolar basement membrane, involve loss of type II cell differentiation and transition to a type I epithelium. As in other cells, the extracellular matrix appears to be an important determinant of type II cell differentiation. This effect on the type II cell is exerted by both simple and complex matrices and may be modulated by active synthesis and remodeling of the matrix components by the pneumocytes themselves. In general, laminin or laminin-rich complex surfaces favor cellular differentiation; fibronectin or fibronectin-rich complex matrices accelerate loss of differentiated form and function. In both cases, matrix-initiated changes in the type II cell involve regulation of cell shape and morphology, hormone responsiveness, secretory activity, phospholipid synthesis, protein turnover, and gene expression. These influences of the extracellular matrix, along with the effects of locally acting soluble factors, likely direct the cellular transitions required for restoration of a physiologically competent alveolar surface during the repair of lung injury.\r"

Two commercially available nebulizer systems were used, namely, a Turret nebulizer operated at a compressed gas flow rate of 12 L/min (droplet MMD, 3.3 mu) and an Inspiron nebulizer driven at 6 L/min (MMD, 7.7 mu). Albuterol was given as doses of 250 micrograms, 250 micrograms, 500 micrograms, and 1,000 micrograms (cumulative dose, 2 mg) and ipratropium bromide as doses of 50 micrograms, 50 micrograms, 100 micrograms, and 200 micrograms (cumulative dose, 400 micrograms) at intervals of 35 minutes. For albuterol, bronchodilatation was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater at all dosage levels with the Turret. For ipratropium, bronchodilatation was similar for both nebulizers. Measurements of aerosol deposition using 99mTc-labelled pentetic acid (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid; DTPA) showed that 9.1 +/- 1.1 percent and 2.7 +/- 0.2 percent of the dose reached the lungs during nebulization to dryness for Turret and Inspiron, respectively (p less than 0.01); distribution within the lungs was similar for the two aerosols. Selection of nebulizer apparatus can influence delivery of aerosol and subsequent bronchodilator response to albuterol in patients with chronic stable asthma but is less important for aerosol delivery of ipratropium bromide in these patients.\r"

There was no significant correlation between serum values of KL-6 antigen and LDH activity. There was a positive correlation between KL-6 antigen levels and the degree of clinical disease activity as measured by 67Ga-citrate scintigram and the clinical course. Though this is a preliminary study, these observations suggest that the serum level of KL-6 antigen may be a useful indicator of disease activity in patients with interstitial pneumonitis. It does not appear to be useful, however, in the differential diagnosis of interstitial pneumonitis from malignant and nonmalignant diseases.\r"

Rats were bilaterally OVX and 6 weeks (Exp 1) or 2 weeks (Exp 2) later a stainless steel cannula was implanted in the third cerebral ventricle (3V). Seven to 10 days later, an intraatrial cannula was inserted. The next day, a blood sample was withdrawn, and each conscious unrestrained animal received a 3V injection of synthetic porcine NPY (5 or 0.5 micrograms/2 microliters saline) or vehicle in Exp 1. Blood samples were taken every 10 min for 2 h and centrifuged, and the plasma was analyzed for LH by RIA. In Exp 2, OVX rats received a 3V injection of NPY (5 micrograms/2 microliters) or vehicle. Blood samples were taken before and 60 min after injection. At 60 min, LHRH (10 ng/100 g BW) was injected iv, and blood was withdrawn 10, 20, 60, and 120 min later. NPY caused a dramatic dose-related reduction in the pulsatile release of LH compared to that in vehicle-treated rats. The 5.0-micrograms dose of NPY significantly reduced LH pulse frequency (P less than 0.05), pulse amplitude (P less than 0.01), and trough levels (P less than 0.01) compared to those in saline-injected controls. The lower dose of NPY (0.5 micrograms) significantly decreased the mean LH levels throughout the 2-h sampling period and slightly, though not significantly, the pulse frequency. Administration of LHRH increased plasma LH levels by 124% in control animals and by 1239% in NPY-injected rats. The results of these studies indicate that the suppressive effects of NPY on pulsatile LH release appear to be exerted through inhibition of pulsatile LHRH secretion from the hypothalamus.\r"

  ".W": "Corticosteroid 11 beta-dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the biologically active steroid cortisol to its inactive metabolite cortisone, is present in testis. Since excess cortisol in men and other mammals and excess corticosterone in rodents cause physiological abnormalities including abnormal testicular function, it was pertinent to study the cellular distribution of 11 beta-dehydrogenase in the testis. Purified antiserum directed against homogeneous rat 11 beta-dehydrogenase was used to localize the enzyme in the developing rat testis. With immunofluorescence, the enzyme was not detectable in fetal testis or in the testis of young male rats until the 26th day of development. A few interstitial cells were stained in the testis of 26-day-old animals. In the testis of 31-day-old rats many cells in the interstitium were positive. In adult animals the entire interstitial region displayed bright fluorescence. Depleting animals of germ cells did not abolish the fluorescence. The appearance of this enzyme correlates temporally with the postnatal increase in Leydig cell number and the developmental rise in serum testosterone. We suggest that 11 beta-dehydrogenase of Leydig cells protects the testis from the deleterious effects of cortisol.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that administration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) to intact rats results in an acute (within 60-120 min) stimulation of hepatic fatty acid synthesis, which persists for an extended period. Hepatic cholesterol synthesis is also stimulated by 16-17 h after TNF alpha treatment. We now demonstrate, using intact mice, that stimulation of hepatic lipid synthesis is not solely the property of the cytokine TNF alpha. Incorporation of 3H2O into fatty acids in the liver was increased 60-120 min and 16-17 h after the administration of TNF beta, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interferon-alpha (IFN alpha). TNF alpha, IL-1, and IFN alpha all rapidly stimulate hepatic fatty acid synthesis (within 0-30 min), with the peak occurring at 60-120 min. The half-maximal doses of TNF alpha (200 ng) and IL-1 (20 ng) that stimulate hepatic fatty acid synthesis are similar to those that induce fever, a well recognized biological effect of these cytokines. Additionally, hepatic cholesterol synthesis was increased 16-17 h after TNF beta, IL-1, and IFN gamma treatment. The present study demonstrates that multiple cytokines from different cell types which act through different receptors can stimulate hepatic fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Previous studies have shown that multiple cytokines can inhibit the synthesis and storage of fat in cultured adipose cells. Taken together, these data indicate that multiple signals to perturb lipid metabolism may be produced as a consequence of an immunological or inflammatory response.\r"

The ACTH response, but not the glucose response, was blocked by treatment with chlorpromazine-morphine-pentobarbital, indicating that the main factors triggering the ACTH response are of central, rather than peripheral, origin. To study whether insulin affected the turnover of CRF and vasopressin (AVP) in the zona externa of the median eminence (ZEME), we determined the rate of decline of both hypophysiotropic factors in rats with or without blockade of axonal transport by colchicine. In the ZEME, the concentrations of CRF and AVP were assessed by quantitative immunocytochemistry (QICC) in tissue sections or by RIA in median eminence extracts. QICC allows selective quantification of AVP and other peptides within the ZEME. The changes in the CRF content, as measured by QICC and RIA, were linearly correlated (r = 0.99), demonstrating that changes in peptide-staining intensity reflect changes in peptide content. Colchicine, when given intracisternally in a nontoxic dose of 5 micrograms, had no marked effect on resting plasma levels of ACTH and only slightly reduced the ACTH response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In the ZEME, CRF and AVP concentrations at rest were not affected by colchicine. In colchicine-treated rats insulin-induced hypoglycemia resulted in a prominent decline in CRF and AVP concentrations in the ZEME. The CRF concentration declined at a rate of 23%/h over a period of 3 h. The AVP concentration declined to a similar extent as CRF over the first hour, but tended to fall at the later time points. We conclude that hypoglycemia increases turnover of both CRF and AVP in the ZEME. However, the turnover rates of both hypophysiotropic peptides do not appear to be quantitatively coupled.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated rat islets of Langerhans were incubated for 2 h in a [3H]inositol-containing medium supplemented with 7 mM glucose and the sulfonylurea tolbutamide (50-200 microM). After labeling, the ability of these islets to respond during a subsequent perifusion to 20 mM glucose or 15 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC) was assessed. The following major observations were made. Prior exposure to tolbutamide inhibited [3H]inositol efflux, inositol phosphate accumulation, and the insulin secretory responses of subsequently perifused islets to 20 mM glucose stimulation. When present during the 2-h labeling period, the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine (500 nM), a compound that abolishes tolbutamide-induced increases in PI hydrolysis, blocked these inhibitory effects of tolbutamide. In addition, the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor monooleoylglycerol (50 microM) restored the impaired second phase insulin secretory response noted after a 2-h tolbutamide exposure. Prior exposure to tolbutamide (200 microM) also desensitized the islet, in terms of [3H] inositol phosphate accumulation, [3H]inositol efflux, and insulin secretory responses, to 15 mM KIC. The inclusion of monooleoylglycerol during the stimulatory period with KIC restored second phase insulin secretion. The results support the conclusion that chronic tolbutamide-induced increases in PI hydrolysis render the beta-cell insensitive to a subsequent 20-mM glucose or 15-mM KIC stimulus. Blocking tolbutamide-induced increases in PI hydrolysis during the labeling period eliminates the adverse effects of the sulfonylurea. The ineffectiveness of glucose and KIC to maintain insulin secretory responses from prior tolbutamide-exposed islets appears to be the result of the inability of these agonists to appropriately activate PI hydrolysis.\r"

Incubation of both neuronal and glial cells with insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in the steady state levels of glucose transporter mRNA. The maximal response was achieved between 2-4 h and subsequently decreased. Both insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I at a dose of 1 ng/ml elicited an approximately 57% increase in glucose transporter mRNA levels in neuronal cultures after 90 min, suggesting that each peptide was acting through its own receptor. On the other hand, insulin stimulated [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake in glial, but not neuronal, cells. These results suggest that insulin-like peptides regulate the expression of the rat brain/Hep G2 glucose transporter gene at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, and that these regulatory mechanisms may be dissociated from each other. Insulin-like peptides may, therefore, participate in the control of brain energy metabolism.\r"

Physiological concentrations of androgens strongly inhibit both basal and estrogen-induced cell proliferation in the human breast cancer cell line ZR-75-1 through their interaction with the androgen receptor. The present study shows that androgens strongly suppress estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor contents in this model, as measured by radioligand binding and anti-ER monoclonal antibodies. Similar inhibitory effects are observed on the levels of ER messenger RNA (mRNA) measured by ribonuclease protection assay. The androgenic effect is observed at subnanomolar concentrations of the nonaromatizable androgen 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, regardless of the presence of estrogens, and is competitively reversed by the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide. Such data on ER expression provide an explanation for at least part of the antiestrogenic effects of androgens on breast cancer cell growth and moreover suggest that the specific inhibitory effects of androgen therapy could be additive to the standard treatment limited to blockade of estrogens by antiestrogens.\r"

  ".W": "During the purification of skeletal growth factor/insulin-like growth factor-II and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) from EDTA extracts of bovine bone matrix significant mitogenic activity for cultured osteoblast (Ob)-like cells eluted in fractions that contained a nearly homogeneous peptide with a mol wt of about 14,000. This peptide has been purified to apparent homogeneity and identified as bovine beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) by amino-terminal amino acid sequencing. During the final purification of beta 2M by CN reverse phase HPLC the mitogenic activity for bone cells separated from the beta 2M protein peak. In spite of this the apparently homogeneous beta 2M preparation retained some mitogenic activity. The ED50 of the bone-derived beta 2M (4,890 +/- 462 ng/ml) was several orders of magnitude (2 x 10(3) to 1.4 x 10(5) times) greater than the ED50 of simultaneously assayed purified growth factors and was no different from the ED50 of the crude EDTA matrix extract (3,350 +/- 890 ng/ml). The beta 2M accounted for less than 0.002% of the total mitogenic activity for Ob-like cells present in the extracted matrix proteins. The following lines of evidence suggest that the mitogenic activity of bone matrix-derived beta 2M (BMD-beta 2M) is due to contamination of the BMD-beta 2M with TGF beta rather than an intrinsic property of beta 2M: 1) the coelution of TGF beta through four successive purification procedures and purification of TGF beta from adjoining fractions from C4 reverse phase HPLC; 2) the abolition of biological activity of BMD-beta 2M and TGF beta with reducing agents; 3) the lack of additive stimulation of [3H] methylthymidine incorporation into bone cells when beta 2M was added to maximally active concentrations of purified TGF beta; 4) the reduction of mitogenic activity when the BMD-beta 2M was incubated with anti-TGF beta; and 5) the inhibition of mink lung epithelial proliferation by the beta 2M preparation. Based on these findings we conclude that although beta 2M is present in bovine bone matrix extracts, it is not a mitogen for Ob-like cells.\r"

  ".U": "89289594\r", 
  ".W": "Mechanisms for high sensitivity in the assay of thyroid stimulating antibody under low salt (NaCl-deprived) hypotonic condition were analyzed using FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells. First, intracellular and extracellular cAMP contents after stimulations with TSH and Graves' immunoglobulin (Ig) were measured under both low salt (hypotonic) and high salt (isotonic) conditions. Higher total and much higher extracellular cAMP production were observed under the low salt condition. Under the high salt condition, the intracellular cAMP content reached a plateau after 10 min, whereas it increased progressively up to 120 min under the low salt condition. Thus, other cellular mechanisms, as well as increase in membrane permeability, seem to be involved in the enhanced response under the low salt condition. On the other hand, pretreatment of the cells with low salt solution without stimulator resulted in a decrease in subsequent cAMP response to TSH or Graves' Ig. Furthermore, [125I]bovine TSH binding to the cells under low salt condition also decreased after the cells were pretreated with the low salt solution. Scatchard analysis revealed that this decrease was due to a decrease in the Cmax of the low affinity binding site of the TSH receptor. Presence of stimulatory ligands to the TSH receptor from the beginning of exposure of the cells to low salt conditions was considered necessary. When the cells had been pretreated at 4 C with stimulator preparations in low salt condition, subsequent incubation at 37 C without stimulator resulted in more cAMP production than the case of high salt pretreatment. Moreover, low salt ligand-free incubation after the high salt binding resulted in higher cAMP production than high salt ligand-free incubation after the low salt binding. Thus, both initial binding and incubation under the low salt condition appear capable of augmenting cAMP production. The fact that the sensitivity of the low salt assay to Graves' Ig was higher than that to bovine TSH was found to relate closely to the increase in initial binding. In conclusion, augmentation of cAMP production under low salt conditions is considered to be related not only to increased ligand binding and increased membrane permeability, but also to some alterations of postreceptor mechanisms during incubation. The proposed postreceptor mechanisms seem to be induced by stimulator binding, which prevents the TSH receptor from damage and promotes intracellular cAMP production progressively. Details of this remain to be elucidated.\r"

To study the role of insulin during embryogenesis, we have recently cloned preproinsulin cDNAs from this species. Unexpectedly, we identified two preproinsulin cDNAs corresponding to two different nonallelic genes that code for similar but distinctly different insulins. We now report the isolation, amino acid sequence, and characterization of both of these insulins from pancreatic extracts of adult toads, confirming that both Xenopus preproinsulin genes are expressed. Xenopus insulins represent the first amphibian insulins to be characterized. Xenopus insulin I and Xenopus insulin II are more similar to each other than they are to insulins of other species. In addition, Xenopus insulins are more similar to mammalian and bird insulins, than they are to fish insulins, implying a closer evolutionary link to terrestrial vertebrates than to most aquatic vertebrates. A homogeneous preparation of Xenopus insulin I showed high reactivity in a pork insulin RIA. Xenopus insulin I was approximately 2-fold more potent than pork insulin in binding to insulin receptors on human IM-9 lymphocytes and 1.5-fold more potent than pork insulin in stimulating glucose oxidation in rat adipocytes. We were unable to purify Xenopus insulin II sufficiently for immunological and biological characterization.\r"

To study the physiological role of adrenal renin, we developed a serum-free culture system for adrenal capsular/zona glomrulosa explants. Explants showed good viability in culture (greater than 80%), and demonstrated net production of aldosterone, angiotensin II, and prorenin. Aldosterone production was consistently stimulated by an increase in potassium (6 mM) in the culture medium. Both aldosterone and angiotensin II production could be attenuated by adding the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril to the culture medium (0.1 mM). These data suggest that rat adrenal explants are capable of producing all of the components of a functional renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and that these components can interact in response to physiological stimuli. These findings support the hypothesis that a local adrenal renin system may play a physiological role in the control of adrenal aldosterone production.\r"

The purpose of the present experiment was to determine whether manipulation of gonadal steroid levels in vivo influenced selectively the in vitro secretion of LHRH and GAP under basal or K+ and phorbol ester (PDBu) stimulation. Secretion of both peptides under each of these three conditions was reduced at least 2-fold in 2-week orchidectomized (ORDX) rats relative to the level in intact controls. Tissue stores of LHRH and GAP were also depressed in the ME of ORDX relative to control rats. When the data were expressed in terms of the percentage of peptide secreted per ME, both groups secreted similar percentages of the peptides into the medium under basal and K+-stimulated conditions. Interestingly, PDBu-activated secretion of LHRH and GAP remained depressed in ORDX animals. The nerve terminals from ORDX animals were not susceptible to a more rapid depletion of releasable peptides, since both groups secreted similar percentages of the peptides during repeated K+ depolarization. By comparison, protein kinase C (PKC)-coupled secretion from ORDX rats was selectively affected, since secretion of pro-LHRH-derived peptides became even more depressed with successive activation with PDBu. Immediate replacement with testosterone after ORDX fully restored the peptide levels in tissue and the LHRH and GAP secretory response to PKC activation. Since testosterone influenced both tissue stores and PDBu-stimulated secretion of LHRH and GAP, this steroid may selectively regulate biosynthesis and secretion of pro-LHRH-derived peptides through activation of the metabolic cascade involving the PKC system.\r"

These studies were conducted 1) to evaluate the effect of GABAergic drugs on in vitro LHRH secretion and 2) to characterize the role of different types of GABA receptors (the GABA-A and GABA-B subtypes) in these actions. Arcuate nuclei-median eminence fragments were incubated in vitro, and the release of LHRH, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), arginine vasopressin, and oxytocin was measured by RIA. Both GABA and muscimol at different concentrations induced an increase in LHRH release, but did not affect the release of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin. This stimulatory effect was blocked by the specific GABA antagonist bicuculline, suggesting the involvement of GABA-A type receptors. Muscimol-stimulated LHRH release was not affected by the presence of phentolamine, suggesting that the stimulatory effect of GABA-A receptors on LHRH release is not mediated by interactions with the noradrenergic system. PGE2 has been shown to be a potent secretagogue of LHRH from the median eminence in vitro, and in this model the stimulatory effect of PGE2 was enhanced by muscimol. Baclofen, a specific GABA-B type receptor agonist, had no effect on basal LHRH release, but completely suppressed naloxone-stimulated LHRH and PGE2 secretion. The inhibitory effect of baclofen was blocked by the presence of 5-aminovalerate, a drug that has been shown to block the inhibitory effect of baclofen on NE release from noradrenergic terminals. This suggests the possibility that GABA-B receptors interacting with noradrenergic terminals may be responsible for the inhibitory effect of baclofen on naloxone stimulation. This study uncovered both stimulatory and inhibitory effects of GABA on LHRH release after activation of GABA-A or GABA-B receptors, respectively. Further, the data show possible relationships among the GABAergic, endogenous opiate peptide, and noradrenergic systems in the control of LHRH release from the hypothalamus.\r"

After insertion of a push-pull cannula into the stalk-median eminence, a modified Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer solution was infused through the push-cannula, and perfusates were collected through the pull-cannula at 200 microliters/10 min. LHRH in perfusates was determined by RIA. Two 6-h sampling sessions, in the morning (0600-1200 h; lights on 0600 h) and in the evening (1800-2400 h; lights off 1800 h) were performed in each animal. LHRH release patterns were analyzed in prepubertal (15.7 +/- 0.7 months of age; mean +/- SEM, n = 6) early pubertal (premenarcheal; 26.1 +/- 1.0 months, n = 7), and midpubertal (40.0 +/- 1.4 months, n = 6) monkeys. Results were as follows: 1) LHRH release was pulsatile in all age groups. While LHRH release in five of six prepubertal animals consisted of small (amplitude less than 2.5 pg/ml) pulses, in all peripubertal animals LHRH release was a mixture of small and large (amplitude greater than 2.5 pg/ml) pulses. 2) There was a significant developmental increase in mean LHRH release (P less than 0.02), and this was particularly apparent in the evening. Mean LHRH release in the early and midpubertal groups was higher than that in the prepubertal group (P less than 0.05 for morning and P less than 0.01 for evening). The mean release in the evening of the midpubertal group further increased over that of the early pubertal group (P less than 0.05). 3) Similarly, LHRH pulse amplitude increased developmentally (P less than 0.01). Pulse amplitudes in early and midpubertal groups were higher than those in the prepubertal group (P less than 0.05 for morning and P less than 0.02 for evening). Again the amplitude in the evening further increased from the early pubertal to the midpubertal period (P less than 0.05). 4) There was also a developmental increase in basal LHRH release (P less than 0.01). The evening values in the early pubertal and midpubertal groups were higher than those in the prepubertal group (P less than 0.05). 5) The interpulse interval decreased developmentally (P less than 0.001). Interpulse intervals in early and midpubertal groups were shorter than those in the prepubertal group (P less than 0.01 for morning and P less than 0.025 for evening).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The transgenic expression of a class I MHC gene (H-2Kb) in the beta-cells of either syngeneic or allogeneic mice leads to beta-cell failure by a nonimmune mechanism. Several class II MHC transgenes, with one exception, have the same effect, but the expression of other transgenes that have products that are membrane proteins is not necessarily detrimental. Class I MHC molecules have been shown to interact directly with other membrane proteins. The inappropriate expression of MHC molecules could therefore interfere with key cellular functions. We postulate that the hyperexpression of MHC molecules in the beta-cell, e.g. in response to viruses, is a primary, nonimmune mechanism of beta-cell failure that precedes a secondary autoimmune response.\r"

The Na+-pumping activity, estimated from both Na+-K+-ATPase and ouabain binding, was significantly decreased in IDDM and NIDDM subjects, but its insulin sensitivity was retained only in young IDDM subjects. The total cholesterol and phospholipid content of the erythrocyte plasma membrane was lowered in IDDM subjects, and cholesterol-to-phospholipid molar ratio was significantly decreased. In NIDDM subjects the significant decreased of the two lipid components did not alter their ratio. The analysis of major phospholipid components of erythrocyte membranes revealed that only phosphatidylcholine is significantly increased in young diabetic subjects. The fatty acid composition of major phospholipid classes was significantly altered in all cases: the unsaturation index appeared to be increased in phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin for both IDDM and NIDDM subjects and was also increased in phosphatidylcholine in the latter group.\r"

Arterial pH did not change from the basal value during NaCl infusion but decreased (P less than .01) and increased (P less than .01) during HCl and NaHCO3 infusions, respectively. Total leucine carbon entry did not change from the basal value during saline infusion but increased (P less than .01) with acidosis and decreased (P less than .05) with alkalosis. Compared with saline controls, acidosis increased (P less than .01) leucine oxidation. During alkalosis decreased (P less than .01) leucine oxidation. During acidosis, total plasma essential and nonessential amino acid concentrations increased (P less than .05), whereas during alkalosis, total plasma essential and nonessential amino acid concentrations decreased (P less than .05). These studies suggest that acute alterations in arterial pH may affect the regulation of protein metabolism in vivo and must be considered in the interpretation of results from experiments in which alterations of acid-base homeostasis may have occurred.\r"

Capillary density (CD) and capillary basement membrane (CBM) thickness were measured in the plantar muscle of sedentary and trained OZR and sedentary lean Zucker rats (LZRs). At 11 wk old, when profoundly obese, hyperinsulinemic, and insulin resistant, OZRs had lower CD and thicker CBM than LZRs. These characteristics are consistent with the expression of human diabetic microangiopathy and imply altered diffusion capacity due to increased diffusion distance and changes in the capillary wall. Between 11 and 18 wk of age, OZRs became hyperglycemic. No age-related changes in CD were observed in lean or obese animals, and OZRs had lower CDs than LZRs at 18 wk of age. CBM thickness decreased from 11 to 18 wk of age in both lean and obese animals, but the decline was proportionally greater in OZRs, and the CBM of obese animals was only slightly thicker than in lean 18-wk-old animals. Exercise training did not alter CD or CBM thickness in 11-wk-old animals. In contrast, training for 6 or 12 wk increased both CD and CBM thickness in 18-wk-old animals, normalizing CD but further increasing CBM thickness relative to LZRs. Correlational analysis revealed that CBM thickness is related to basal insulin concentration (r = .29, P less than .05) but not to basal glucose (r = .12, P greater than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Insulin antibodies were not detected in an insulin-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but they were easily detected in an insulin-copolymer-capture ELISA. Thus, there is a high degree of steric hindrance because of the proximity of the epitopes on the insulin monomer. This is circumvented by substituting an insulin copolymer for insulin in the capture ELISA. A regression analysis comparing the titers of 28 Lou/M rat insulin antiserums measured by liquid-phase radioimmune titration (RIT) with titers obtained in the direct insulin ELISA was not significant (P greater than .05). Thus, epitopes on insulin available and/or masked for antibody binding in the RIT differ from those available and/or masked in the direct insulin ELISA. As more of the epitopes become available when an insulin copolymer is substituted for monomeric insulin in the ELISAs, a significant positive correlation (P less than .05) with the RIT was observed with these 28 insulin antiserums. Twenty-five percent (7 of 28) of these antiserums contained more antibodies that bound to epitopes available in the ELISAs that were masked in the RIT. Conversely, two antiserums contained more antibodies that bound to epitopes that were available in the RIT but were masked in the ELISAs. Thus, the amount of insulin antibodies measured in a given antiserum can vary substantially, depending on which epitopes are made available or are masked in the particular antibody-titration method used. These results demonstrate that the humoral immune response to insulin among inbred Lou/M rats can vary in insulin-antibody levels as well as the epitopes on insulin to which the antibodies bind.\r"

  ".U": "89290164\r", 
  ".W": "With a glucose-responsive beta-cell line (HIT cells), we tested the hypothesis that the cytosolic free-Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]i) is an intracellular signal through which a rise in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels is transmitted to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In these cells, glucose stimulates the acute release of insulin without increasing [Ca2+]i or altering cAMP content. Either forskolin or 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and increased cAMP levels. At either a submaximal glucose concentration or maximally stimulatory glucose concentration, both IBMX and forskolin triggered a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i (1.9- and 1.5-fold increase over basal levels, respectively). Similarly, glucagon stimulated a 1.3-fold increase in [Ca2+]i over basal levels. The effect on [Ca2+]i required glucose and was secondary to Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels because it was blocked by either chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA or by the Ca2+-channel blockers verapamil and nimodipine. Verapamil also inhibited IBMX potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and the IBMX-induced rise in [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner with IC50s of 2 x 10(-5) and 4 x 10(-6) M, respectively. We conclude that in the beta-cell, a rise in cAMP levels increases Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and that this represents a mechanism by which cAMP potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in beta-cells.\r"

Serotyping of lethally irradiated hosts reconstituted with allogeneic bone marrow showed the hematopoietically derived cells to be of donor origin. Our results showed that lethally irradiated NOD mice reconstituted with a B10.BR/cd hematopoietic cell system remained totally free of insulitis, failed to develop diabetes, and thrived to old age. In contrast, lethally irradiated C57BL/6 or B10.BR/cd mice reconstituted with an NOD hematopoietic cell system all developed insulitis, but only approximately 10% progressed to overt diabetes. Direct adoptive transfer of insulitis and diabetes by mature T-lymphocytes apparently was not required; analogous results were obtained when diabetes-nonsusceptible hosts were reconstituted with NOD hematopoietic cells containing T-lymphocytes or devoid of Thy-1+ cells. The difference in frequency for the development of insulitis versus insulitis plus overt diabetes in C57BL/6 and B10.BR/cd mice suggests that the hematopoietically derived immune cells from NOD mice were sufficient to induce anti-islet reactivity but may require the diabetogenic host environment to develop the frequency and severity of diabetes observed in NOD mice.\r"

GLP-I-(7-36)-amide, a truncated form of full-sequence GLP-I-(1-37), showed a potent inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion. This inhibitory effect of GLP-I-(7-36)-amide was demonstrated at concentrations of 0.25, 2.5, and 25 nM in 11.2 and 2.8 mM glucose. In contrast, insulin release was significantly stimulated by GLP-I-(7-36)-amide at its concentration from 0.025 to 25 nM in a high glucose concentration, whereas in a low glucose concentration, the stimulation was seen only at the highest concentration (25 nM). Neither GLP-I-(1-37) nor GLP-II showed any effect on glucagon and insulin release. Although several gastrointestinal hormones have been nominated as incretins, none of them may suppress the glucagon secretion. A truncated form of GLP-I, GLP-I-(7-36)-amide thus seems to be a unique incretin that exerts glucagonostatic action.\r"

Epitrochlearis muscles from rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes and from controls were incubated in vitro for 0.5-12.0 h. Diabetes decreased maximal insulin-stimulated (20 mU/ml) glucose transport capacity by 60% (P less than .001), but this decreased insulin responsiveness returned to normal on in vitro incubation (3.79 +/- 0.59 before vs. 8.92 +/- 0.64 mumol.ml-1.h-1 after 12 h of incubation). The reversal of decreased insulin responsiveness in diabetic muscles did not require the presence of insulin and was not affected by the presence of 5.0 x 10(-8) M of epinephrine. However, it was possible to partially prevent the development of insulin resistance with regard to glucose transport by treating the rats with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) every 12 h during the entire 72-h period in which the animals were kept diabetic (insulin responsiveness was 3.16 +/- 0.40 mumol.ml-1.h-1 for saline-injected group vs. 5.55 +/- 0.46 mumol.ml-1.h-1 for propranolol-treated group). This effect was not present after a single injection of the drug 2 h before the experiment or when propranolol treatment was withdrawn 12 h before the experiment. The beta-adrenergic blockade markedly reduced the plasma concentration of free fatty acids (0.5 +/- 0.01 mumol/ml for propranolol-treated rats vs. 1.1 +/- 0.1 mumol/ml for saline-treated rats; P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of beta-cell deficiency on the spontaneous pulsatile secretory pattern of the islets of Langerhans was studied in the baboon. Measures of beta-cell function were correlated with the secretory pattern before and at intervals after streptozocin administration. The degree of insulin deficiency was variable and ranged from mild to moderate. Highly regular pulses were less prevalent in baboons compared with rhesus monkeys and humans, but the mean frequency was similar and was not affected by treatment. The principal effect of beta-cell destruction was to proportionately reduce the pulse amplitude of insulin (-39%, P less than .003) without detectable change in pulse frequency, interhormonal phase relationship, or the regularity of pulses. Glucagon-pulse amplitude also fell (-19%, P less than .09), but not significantly. However, glucagon-pulse amplitude was strongly correlated with insulin-pulse amplitude (r = -.59, P less than .002), whereas mean fasting plasma concentrations of insulin and glucagon were not significantly changed after treatment. Because streptozocin affects only the beta-cell, the data indicate a major influence of the insulin pulse on the alpha-cell secretory pulse. The data do not support the presence of a separate pacemaker for the alpha-cell but do not eliminate this possibility. The strong correlation of reduction in insulin-pulse amplitude with increasing fasting glucose and decreasing glucose disappearance lends support to growing evidence that the pattern of insulin secretion is an important determinant of normal glucose homeostasis.\r"

Although the 24-hour mortality of 1.0% was higher during elective PTCA for the elderly versus 0.3% in those 65 and under, this is still very acceptable when compared with coronary artery bypass grafting.

Immunofluorescent visualization of receptor-bound low-density lipoproteins revealed that low-density lipoprotein binding sites were distributed on the surface of nearly all cells of the culture. Binding sites for malondialdehyde-treated low-density lipoproteins were found in only 5% of the cultured cells, and these cells differed from hepatocytes in shape and size. Cultured hepatocytes internalized and native low-density lipoproteins, but not malondialdehyde-treated low-density lipoproteins, labeled with the fluorescent dye 3',3'-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine. About 15% of the cells that take up 3',3'-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-labeled malondialdehyde-treated low-density lipoproteins could be identified as liver endothelial cells and macrophages, since they internalized formaldehyde-treated human albumin and fluorescent carboxylated microspheres. Our results indicate that human hepatocytes in primary culture express surface receptors for native low-density lipoproteins but not for modified low-density lipoproteins.\r"

Alterations in efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity produce significant changes in renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, the reabsorption of water, sodium, and other ions, and the release of renin, prostaglandins, and other vasoactive substances. These functional effects contribute significantly to the renal regulation of total body sodium and fluid volumes with important implications for the control of arterial pressure. The renal nerves, both efferent and afferent, are known to be important contributors to the pathogenesis of hypertension. In addition, the efferent renal nerves participate in the mediation of the excessive renal sodium retention, which characterizes edema-forming states such as congestive heart failure. Thus, the renal nerves play an important role in overall cardiovascular homeostasis in both normal and pathological conditions.\r"

Indeed, these cells can release both dilator and constrictor substances. The major endothelium-derived relaxing factor may be nitric oxide, which activates soluble guanylate cyclase in the smooth muscle, although the endothelial cells also secrete an unidentified hyperpolarizing factor. Among the natural stimuli for the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors are circulating hormones, platelet products, thrombin, shear stress, and certain autacoids. Endothelium-derived relaxing factors may contribute to the regulation of the release of atrial natriuretic factor and renin. The endothelial cells can also release constricting factors; among the likely candidates are superoxide anions or the peptide endothelin. In hypertensive blood vessels, the ability to release endothelium-derived relaxing factors but not endothelium-derived contracting factors is blunted.\r"

  ".W": "Salt intake in excess of body needs has long been considered a factor in the genesis and maintenance of human hypertension; the mechanism is salt retention due to faulty renal excretory efficiency. This discussion reviews clinical studies that make a case either for or against the salt hypothesis. Included is a summary of recent experiences with 4 days of salt depletion and 3 days of salt loading in 96 normotensive control subjects and 40 hypertensive patients. These studies were done to test the hypothesis that salt-sensitive blood pressure changes are quantitatively related to sodium balance. However, we found no statistically significant relation between arterial pressure changes and sodium lost during salt depletion or retained during salt loading. The failure of that hypothesis prompted a study of the known factors that control arterial pressure by using multidimensional response surface modeling for changes produced by salt loading. The analysis indicated that in these experiments salt-sensitive blood pressure changes of hypertensive patients were controlled differently than those of normotensive subjects. In the hypertensive group, the changes were highly predictable by combinations of variables, which featured plasma aldosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. In the normotensive group, the changes were less predictable; fewer of the factors were involved, and plasma renin activity was the featured variable. These findings and results of studies done over the past 50 years indicate that salt-dependent hypertension is controlled by many factors and is not a strict correlate of salt intake.\r"

Although several abnormalities in sodium transport have been associated with hypertension, a link between the blood pressure of normotensive subjects and the erythrocyte sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump, the principal sodium transporter of sodium, has not been previously demonstrated. Data from independent measurements of erythrocyte intracellular sodium, ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux, and the number of sodium pump sites per red blood cell were used to calculate a second-order rate constant for ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux. Among 20 normotensive white subjects, this rate constant correlated significantly (p less than 0.005) with mean arterial blood pressure. A significant correlation was not observed between the rate constant and the blood pressure of 22 hypertensive subjects. A hypothesis is proposed, which suggests that the sodium efflux rate constant of erythrocytes is related to the control of sodium reabsorption via the sodium pump of the renal tubules and that an elevated erythrocyte rate constant may be associated with chronic increased sodium reabsorption, which leads to volume expansion and the development of hypertension.\r"

We will review the available molecular techniques, which include gene cloning, transient and stable expressions, as well as the use of transgenic animals. To facilitate our discussion, we will focus primarily on research of the renin gene. Renin provides a useful model that illustrates the power of biotechnology in providing detailed structural and biochemical information on a complex protein that exists in low quantities in vivo. Studies of its messenger RNA and gene expression have resulted in an improved understanding of the biology of the renin system and in generating new hypotheses. These approaches can be generalized to studies of other vasoactive hormones, contractile protein, and other gene products related to cardiovascular regulation. To elucidate the role of a specific gene in genetic hypertension, we will discuss the use of genetic markers in cosegregation or linkage analysis. Finally, we will examine the potential of transgenic animals in the study of regulation of gene expression in the whole animal and the contribution of selective genes to hypertension. We believe that molecular biology complements the biochemical and physiological approaches and provides new opportunities for furthering our concept of hypertension mechanisms.\r"

In rats treated chronically with enalapril (30 mg/kg/day), CP71362 decreased blood pressure by an additional 5 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.025) and reduced plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentrations to undetectable levels. The effects of renin inhibition were also tested under conditions where the renin-angiotensin system was stimulated. In rats on a low sodium diet, CP71362 decreased blood pressure by 15 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001), a decrease similar to that in rats on a normal diet. Plasma renin activity was decreased below detectable limits, but plasma angiotensin II concentrations were not reduced. In rats on a low sodium diet treated chronically with enalapril, CP71362 did not further decrease blood pressure although angiotensin II levels were significantly reduced. An additive effect of combined converting enzyme and renin inhibition on blood pressure lowering and inhibition of plasma angiotensin II was found in rats anesthetized with Inactin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Vascular renin activity and angiotensin II (Ang II) released into the perfusate were determined. Infusion of N-acetyl-pepstatin (5 X 10(-8)-5 X 10(-6) M) suppressed vascular renin activity and Ang II release dose dependently. Isoproterenol (10(-6) M) induced a 135 +/- 30% increase in Ang II release from the basal value. N-Acetyl-pepstatin (5 X 10(-6) M) suppressed isoproterenol-induced Ang II release. Infusions of 5 X 10(-6) M captopril and the diacid forms of enalapril, ramipril, cilazapril, and CS-622 by themselves had little effect on Ang II release, but concomitant infusion of isoproterenol with these angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors significantly decreased Ang II release (71 +/- 21%, 51 +/- 40%, 8 +/- 21%, 69 +/- 24%, and 44 +/- 29% increase, respectively, from the basal values). These results indicate that N-acetyl-pepstatin suppresses the vascular renin-angiotensin system. This effect may in part contribute to the hypotensive actions of renin inhibitors. Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors also suppress locally generated Ang II, the mechanism and physiological significance still remain to be clarified.\r"

We studied whether converting enzyme inhibitor-stimulated prostaglandin I2 synthesis might be mediated by kinins. Anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a continuous 70-minute infusion of either saline or a kinin analogue antagonist, [DArg0-Hyp3-Thi5-DPhe7-Thi8]bradykinin, 8 micrograms/kg/min. After 10 minutes, rats were given an intravenous bolus of either vehicle or the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (30 micrograms/100 g body wt). After 70 minutes, aorta and renal cortical slices were harvested and incubated in vitro in buffer without drugs at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C for 60 minutes. The buffer was then sampled for measurement of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (an index of prostaglandin I2), prostaglandin E2, and renin release (angiotensin I generation) by radioimmunoassay. The aortic prostaglandin I2 from rats treated with converting enzyme inhibitor was significantly elevated (36.7 +/- 5.0 ng/mg dry wt/hr) compared with aorta from rats treated with either vehicle (25.6 +/- 2.2 ng/mg/hr), kinin antagonist (25.1 +/- 2.4 ng/mg/hr), or kinin antagonist plus converting enzyme inhibitor (23.0 +/- 2.0 ng/mg/hr), p less than 0.02. There were no differences in aortic prostaglandin E2, renin release, or prostaglandin E2 from renal cortical slices. Direct in vitro incubation of aorta with molar concentrations of converting enzyme inhibitor from 10(-9) to 10(-4) had no effect on prostaglandin I2. These results suggest that kinins may mediate the effect of converting enzyme inhibition on aortic prostaglandin I2 synthesis and thereby may account for part of the hemodynamic responses resulting from treatment using converting enzyme inhibitors.\r"

To test the hypothesis that these pathways are tonically involved in the maintenance of or the baroreceptor reflex regulation of cardiovascular function, we have examined the effects of intravenous injection of the centrally acting, noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801), on the mean arterial pressure, heart rate, renal sympathetic nerve activity, and behavior of conscious, freely moving sham-operated and sinoaortic baroreceptor-denervated rats. Administration of MK-801 produced, within 5 minutes, dose-dependent elevations in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity that were sustained for 0.5 to 2.5 hours. For an equivalent dose, MK-801 produced approximately twice the peak changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate in the sinoaortic baroreceptor-denervated rats than in the sham-operated rats. Pretreatment results were as follows: 1) The ganglion blocker chlorisondamine markedly attenuated the hypertension and tachycardia in the sham-operated and sinoaortic baroreceptor-denervated rats, 2) pretreatment with the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin virtually abolished the hypertension, and 3) the beta 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol markedly reduced the tachycardia. MK-801 also produced stereotypic behaviors and ataxia in the sham-operated and sinoaortic baroreceptor-denervated rats; however, qualitatively and quantitatively similar changes in behavior were induced in the latter by doses approximately five time lower than required in sham operated rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that endogenously produced dopamine (DA) may play a role in the regulation of renal sodium excretion. In the present study, experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that acute volume expansion with isotonic sodium chloride stimulates the production of DA within the kidney, which in turn acts on specific DA1 receptors to promote sodium excretion. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, acute volume expansion over a period of 1 hour evoked a pronounced increase in urine output and urinary sodium excretion. These diuretic and natriuretic effects were not accompanied by any significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate. However, there was a significant elevation in central venous pressure and a transient rise in glomerular filtration rate. The natriuretic and diuretic response was accompanied by a significant increase in urinary DA excretion, and this effect was clearly dissociated from the rise in glomerular filtration rate. In a separate group of rats, the effects of acute volume expansion were studied in the presence of selective DA1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 (50 micrograms/kg i.v. bolus; 10 micrograms/kg/min). During DA1 receptor blockade, there was a marked attenuation in the diuretic and natriuretic response throughout the period of volume expansion, when compared with that in the control group. The changes in central venous pressure and glomerular filtration rate were identical in the two groups. In another group of rats, the renal effects of exogenously administered DA were studied. DA (0.5 micrograms/kg/min) produced significant increases in urine output and urinary sodium excretion, without causing any alterations in blood pressure or glomerular filtration rate, suggesting a tubular site of action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sodium content of both diets was equal. During a 2-week control period, no differences were noted between the two groups. Weight gain was associated with a progressive increase in blood pressure (mean pressure increased by 18.5 +/- 2.1 mm Hg in the high fat group) and plasma volume (plasma volume increased from 1,426 +/- 202 to 2,053 +/- 250 ml in the high fat group). Sodium retention occurred after 1 week of the high fat diet and persisted. Over the 6-week period, the dogs on the high fat diet increased their cumulative sodium balance by 2,024 +/- 462 meq versus an increase of only 289 +/- 97 meq for the dogs on the control diet. In the high fat diet group of dogs, there was a significant relation between change in cumulative sodium balance and the change in blood pressure and plasma volume. After 1 week of the high fat diet, norepinephrine was the only hormone that significantly increased from baseline. Over the next 5 weeks norepinephrine increased no further, whereas fasting insulin and aldosterone progressively increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the renin inhibitor enalkiren (Abbott-64662) was evaluated in eight normal volunteer subjects on a standardized sodium diet (100 mmol/day) by measurement of various components of the renin-angiotensin system and drug levels in plasma. On day 1, vehicle and doses of 0.001, 0.003, and 0.01 mg/kg i.v. were administered within 2 minutes at 90-minute intervals. On day 2, vehicle and doses of 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg i.v. were given. With the higher doses, blood pressure tended to decrease slightly with no change in heart rate. Plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide (angiotensin II) fell markedly in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of plasma renin activity was maximal 5 minutes after administration of the drug and persisted 90 minutes after the doses of 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg. Not surprisingly, there was a close correlation between plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II levels (r = 0.81, n = 28, p less than 0.001). In contrast, active and total renin measured directly by monoclonal antibodies rose in dose-related fashion in response to renin inhibition. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the plasma drug concentrations obtained up to 6 hours after the 0.1 mg/kg dose. By means of a two-compartment model, plasma mean half-life of the drug was estimated at 1.60 +/- 0.43 hours.\r"

  ".W": "Hemodynamic and biochemical effects of the new renin inhibitor CGP 38560A (molecular weight 826) were tested in 15 healthy volunteers after a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled protocol. At a 2-week interval, groups of five subjects received a 30-minute infusion of either 5% dextrose or CGP 38560A 50, 125, or 250 micrograms/kg. Blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity, active and total renin, angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide (angiotensin II), and aldosterone were sequentially measured up to 3 hours from the onset of the infusion. There was no consistent change in blood pressure or heart rate. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin II decreased dose dependently, and peak suppression was observed at the end of the infusion of CGP 38560A and after the 250-micrograms/kg dose. Plasma renin activity fell from 1.0 +/- 0.19 (mean +/- SEM) to less than 0.05 ng/ml/hr in all five subjects (p less than 0.001), and angiotensin II fell from 7.7 +/- 1.2 to 2.6 +/- 0.9 femtomole/ml (p less than 0.01). Active renin rose fourfold from 24 +/- 1.9 to 98 +/- 14 pg/ml (p less than 0.001) at the end of the infusion of the high dose. Plasma angiotensin II returned toward its initial values much faster than plasma renin activity and active renin. In conclusion, CGP 38560A was well tolerated. It induced a dose-dependent decrease in angiotensin II and plasma renin activity and a long-lasting and dose-dependent rise in active renin. The doses used did not reduce plasma angiotensin II maximally despite reduction of plasma renin activity to unmeasurable levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A segment of elastic tubing is compressed by a pneumatically driven pushing plate under control of a microprocessor. Flow parameters such as pulse rate and stroke volume can be set. The pump can be synchronized with the patient's ECG for counterpulsation heart assist. A total of 87 open-heart procedures were performed using randomly either a conventional roller pump or the Parenzan-Fumero pump (respectively 39 and 48 patients). A previously published cpb protocol and anesthetic regimen were adopted in all cases. The results show increased cooling and rewarming rate (p less than 0.05) and urinary output, decreased vascular resistance, intensive care unit time and need for blood transfusion in the pulsatile group compared to the continuous perfusion group. In the pulsatile group, mortality was significantly lower (10.4% vs 25.6%) and low cardiac output syndrome was less frequent in the post-operative course.\r"

To study its efficacy we compared blood glucose fluctuations, integrated glycemia, free insulin and total free insulin concentrations in six insulin-dependent diabetics. After obtaining a steady state of carbohydrate metabolism overnight by feedback control through the artificial endocrine pancreas (AEP) Biostator, the patients received their usual morning and evening doses of insulin by either conventional injection or Vitajet in random order. Blood glucose levels were significantly lower after Vitajet than conventional injections (p less than 0.04) between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., but the difference disappeared from 4 p.m. onwards. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of glucose fluctuations were lower after Vitajet (28036 +/- 4655 vs 31086 +/- 2310 mg. min% mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01). AUCs for free insulin concentrations (microU.min/ml) were close: 39286 +/- 4510 (Vitajet) vs 30597 +/- 3575 (conventional). It is concluded that Vitajet constitutes an efficient needleless route for administering insulin pulses.\r"

Complement components were deposited on the surface of the virus particle in the presence or absence of specific anti-HSV antibodies. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the phagocytosis of fluorescence-labeled viruses and demonstrated that although a virion is able to associate with PMN in the presence of complement alone, the granulocyte is not triggered to mount a metabolic burst. Efficient stimulation of PMN occurs when complexes are formed consisting of virus, specific antibodies, and complement. To address the question whether the viruses were inside or outside the cell, a combined enhancement/quenching method was developed using ammonium chloride as a lysosomotropic agent and trypan blue as a quenching dye. The data indicate that Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis by PMN results in the ingestion of all cell-associated herpes virions. Interactions of virions through PMN-complement receptors CR1 and CR3 results solely in binding to the PMN but not in internalization. Interactions via both complement and Fc receptors cause synergistic stimulation of the PMN and result in very efficient association of viruses, greater than 80% of which were inside the cell.\r"

INF beta 2/IL-6 has also been shown to be identical to MGI-2, a protein that induces differentiation of bone marrow precursor cells toward mature granulocytes and monocytes. Accordingly, we have examined the effect of IFN beta 2/IL-6 on expression of the IL-1- and tumor necrosis factor-unresponsive acute phase protein alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1 AT) in human hepatoma-derived hepatocytes and in human mononuclear phagocytes. Purified human fibroblast and recombinant IFN beta 2/IL-6 each mediate a specific increase in steady-state levels of alpha 1 AT mRNA and a corresponding increase in net synthesis of alpha 1 AT in primary cultures of human peripheral blood monocytes as well as in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Thus, the effect of IFN beta 2/IL-6 on alpha 1 AT gene expression in these cells is primarily due to an increase in accumulation of alpha 1 AT mRNA and can be distinguished from the direct, predominantly translational effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide on expression of this gene in monocytes and macrophages. The results indicate that IFN beta 2/IL-6 regulates acute phase gene expression, specifically alpha 1 AT gene expression, in extrahepatic as well as hepatic cell types.\r"

Patients with these antibodies have an unusually high rate of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in association with their PM. Two patients (K.J. and B.T.) with severe ILD and PM were found to have antibodies to a cytoplasmic antigen, but tests to determine whether the antigen was an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase were negative, including tests of KJ serum for inhibitory effects on the 20 synthetases. KJ immunoprecipitates did not contain tRNA, in contrast to antisynthetase sera. When IgG samples were added to a reticulocyte in vitro translation system at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml, KJ IgG inhibited globin mRNA translation by 98%, while anti-Jo-1 IgG inhibited 62% and normal IgG had little effect. Thus, both anti-KJ and the antisynthetases are directed at antigens that are involved in translation and protein synthesis, and both are associated with the syndrome of lung disease and PM. This syndrome may be associated with antibodies to translation-related proteins in general, which may have implications for the link of PM and enteroviruses, which are mRNA viruses.\r"

Using this canine model, we tested the hypotheses: (a) that thrombin is an important mediator of CFVs in dogs with coronary stenoses and endothelial injury; (b) that inhibition of thrombin with heparin, or MCI-9038, a selective thrombin inhibitor, abolishes CFVs in this model; and (c) that abolition of CFVs by thrombin inhibition is time dependent. CFVs, produced in open-chest dogs by placing a flow-reducing plastic constrictor around the left anterior coronary artery, were monitored for either 30 min (group I) or 3 h (group II) before treatment with either heparin or 4-methyl-1-(N2-[(3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinyl (MCI-9038). In group I, cyclic flow variations were abolished by heparin in 12 of 18 dogs and by MCI-9038 in 5 of 7 dogs. In group II, cyclic flow variations were not abolished by heparin in any of seven dogs and were abolished by MCI-9038 in only one of seven dogs. Thus, (a) thrombin appears to be an important mediator of cyclic flow variations in dogs with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury and (b) inhibition of thrombin abolishes CFVs after short but not prolonged periods of CFVs.\r"

Glucose and FFA metabolism were assessed using stepwise insulin clamp in combination with indirect calorimetry and infusion of [3H]3-glucose/[14C]palmitate. The basal rate of hepatic glucose production (HGP) was higher in NIDDM than in control subjects, and suppression of HGP by insulin was impaired at all but the highest insulin concentration. Glucose disposal was reduced in the NIDD patients at the three highest plasma insulin concentrations, and this was accounted for by defects in both glucose oxidation and nonoxidative glucose metabolism. In NIDDs, suppression of plasma FFA by insulin was impaired at all five insulin steps. This was associated with impaired suppression by insulin of plasma FFA turnover, FFA oxidation (measured by [14C]palmitate) and nonoxidative FFA disposal (an estimate of reesterification of FFA). FFA oxidation and net lipid oxidation (measured by indirect calorimetry) correlated positively with the rate of HGP in the basal state and during the insulin clamp. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that insulin resistance is a general characteristic of glucose and FFA metabolism in NIDDM, and involves both oxidative and nonoxidative pathways. The data also demonstrate that FFA/lipid and glucose metabolism are interrelated in NIDDM, and suggest that an increased rate of FFA/lipid oxidation may contribute to the impaired suppression of HGP and diminished stimulation of glucose oxidation by insulin in these patients.\r"

The screening of neonatal rat myocardial cell cDNA libraries with a conserved rat brain Na+ channel cDNA probe, resulted in the isolation and characterization of a putative rat cardiac Na+ channel cDNA probe (pCSC-1). The deduced amino acid sequence of pCSC-1 displayed a striking degree of homology with the eel, rat brain-1, and rat brain-2 Na+ channel, thereby identifying pCSC-1 as a related member of the family of Na+ channel genes. Northern blot analysis revealed the expression of a 7-kb CSC-1 transcript in rat cardiac tissue and purified myocardial cells, but little or no detectable expression of CSC-1 in rat brain, skeletal muscle, denervated skeletal muscle, or liver. Using RNase protection and Northern blot hybridization with specific rat brain Na+ channel gene probes, expression of the rat brain-1 Na+ channel was observed in rat myocardium, but no detectable expression of the rat brain-2 gene was found. This study provides evidence for the expression of diverse Na+ channel mRNAs in rat myocardium and presents the initial characterization of a new, related member of the family of Na+ channel genes, which appears to be expressed in a cardiac-specific manner.\r"

  ".W": "The primary functions of the gut are to absorb nutrients and exclude bacteria and their products. However, under certain circumstances the gut may lose its barrier function and serve as a reservoir for systemic microbial infections. These experiments were performed to determine the mechanisms whereby endotoxin causes bacteria to escape (translocate) from the gut. Bacteria translocated from the gut to the mesenteric lymph nodes of mice challenged with nonlethal doses of Escherichia coli 026:B6 or E. coli 0111:B4 endotoxin. Physical disruption of the gut mucosal barrier appears to be the primary mechanism whereby endotoxin promotes bacterial translocation. Mucosal injury and endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation were reduced by inhibition (allopurinol) or inactivation (tung-sten diet) of xanthine oxidase activity (P less than 0.01), but were not affected by the platelet-activation factor antagonists, SRI 63-441 or BN 52021. Because the inhibition or inactivation of xanthine oxidase activity reduced both the extent of mucosal injury and endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation, the effect of endotoxin on the gut appears to be mediated, at least to some degree, by xanthine oxidase-generated, oxygen-free radicals.\r"

Insulin (10(-7) M) increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake in differentiated L6 myotubes by 30-40% after 8 h of incubation. The sulfonylurea tolazamide (0.6 mg/ml, 22 h) had no effect on glucose uptake in the absence of insulin, but increased insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake twofold. The total cellular content of glucose transporters was assessed with a monoclonal anti-transporter antibody by a solid-phase ELISA method. Insulin (8 h) increased the quantity of glucose transporters, with a maximal twofold increase at 10(-7) M and a dose-response curve similar to that for insulin stimulation of glucose uptake. In spite of its lack of effect on glucose uptake, tolazamide alone (0.6 mg/ml) increased the cellular content of transporters by 70%. The effects of insulin and tolazamide on transporter gene expression were studied with probes derived from Hep G2 glucose transporter cDNA. Insulin increased the transporter mRNA level 1.7-fold, tolazamide increased it 1.5-fold, and the combination of insulin and tolazamide increased transporter mRNA 3-fold. It is concluded that sulfonylureas, together with insulin, enhance glucose uptake in L6 skeletal muscle cells by increasing the number of functioning glucose transport molecules. The long-term regulation of the glucose transport system in skeletal muscle by insulin and sulfonylureas in vivo may involve similar changes in transporter function, number, and gene expression.\r"

In endemic areas the screening tests described offer a cheap, simple, and accurate means of presumptively identifying Ps pseudomallei from clinical specimens.\r"

Heart period variability (standard deviation [SD] of 120 consecutive RR or PP intervals) was measured at supine rest in 34 patients with congestive heart failure (23 patients receiving diuretics, digoxin or vasodilators and 11 patients weaned from all medications), 30 cardiac transplant patients (both innervated recipient and denervated donor atrial rates) and 16 age-matched healthy control subjects. Arterial baroreflex gain was evaluated with intravenous bolus injections of phenylephrine in 22 transplant patients. Mean heart period variability (+/- SEM) was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in the heart failure groups (22 +/- 3 ms for medicated and 17 +/- 3 ms for nonmedicated) than in the transplant patients (41 +/- 5 ms) or control subjects (58 +/- 5 ms). Heart period variability of the transplant patients was less than that of the control patients (p less than 0.05). A stepwise regression model revealed that heart period variability was inversely related to systolic arterial pressure and directly related to time after transplantation (R2 = 0.39; p = 0.03) in the transplant patients. Baroreflex gain of normotensive transplant patients was normal (11.7 +/- 1.0 ms/mm Hg) and correlated directly with heart period variability (r = 0.62; p less than 0.001). These data suggest that subnormal levels of cardiac parasympathetic activity at rest associated with congestive heart failure can be restored progressively toward normal by correction of congestive heart failure after cardiac transplantation. Post-transplant hypertension opposes this correction of baseline parasympathetic activity.\r"

  ".W": "Recent experimental and clinical studies suggest that torsade de pointes may be precipitated by early afterdepolarizations in the Purkinje or ventricular muscle fibers. This hypothesis offers an alternative to the earlier one that attributes torsade to the underlying dispersion of repolarization. This review lists the clinical conditions associated with torsade de pointes and examines the experimental background of the two proposed electrophysiologic substrates of torsade, namely, the dispersion of repolarization and the early afterdepolarizations. The strengths and weaknesses of the two hypotheses are compared in relation to the following characteristics of torsade de pointes: facilitation by slow heart rate, suppression by pacing, R on T phenomenon, difficulty of induction by programmed stimulation, aggravation by hypokalemia, manifestation of an idiosyncratic reaction to class IA antiarrhythmic drugs, spontaneous termination, suppression by magnesium salts and isoproterenol and induction by such drugs as sotalol, bepridil and prenylamine. It appears that most clinical observations can be explained by either mechanism, but in some cases difficulties are encountered for the afterdepolarization hypothesis.\r"

Therefore, the incidence of the occurrence of the disease is dependent in large part on \"disturbances of human culture.\" These primarily include a cholesterol-rich diet, obesity, cigarette smoking, elevated blood pressure and sedentary life-style. It is gratifying that during the last quarter of a century, large segments of society in the United States have modified many of their adverse patterns of living. As a result, there has been a striking decline in both the incidence of the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and the frequency of premature death due to the disease process. Sudden cardiac death is frequently an unexpected first clinical manifestation of coronary artery disease and, despite heroic efforts, treatment of sudden death victims is frequently unsuccessful. Furthermore, progression of coronary artery disease, even in patients who present with angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction, is unpredictable. Coronary arteriography, the \"gold standard\" used for evaluation, gives insight primarily into anatomy and ventricular function (under experimental conditions) existing at a given instant in time. Which lesions are serious and likely to progress are usually unknown, even to the most experienced angiographer. Therefore, surgical and catheter-directed therapeutic approaches are at best only \"shotgun\" or partial techniques. For these reasons, the principal and continuing therapeutic efforts to reduce the occurrence and control the ravages of coronary artery disease should be directed toward prevention. Such efforts should begin in early childhood and become a lifelong practice, one that all physicians, including the most procedure-dominated specialists, should personally adopt and teach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In a series of 74 heart transplant recipients undergoing annual coronary angiography, a coronary artery to right ventricle fistula was observed in 4 patients, an incidence rate of 5.4%, which is much higher than the expected incidence of congenital coronary artery fistula (0.1% to 0.2%). A traumatic origin of the fistulas is unlikely because none of the heart donors had evidence of chest trauma. An endomyocardial biopsy-related etiology of the fistulas is postulated. All fistulas were located in the biopsy sampling area. Patients with a fistula underwent more biopsies before the diagnosis compared with patients without a fistula (20 +/- 11 versus 14 +/- 6, p = 0.05). At least one large arteriole (diameter greater than 0.16 mm) was found on pathologic examination of the biopsy specimens from each of the patients with a fistula (100%) but in only 2 (16.7%) (p less than 0.01) of 12 randomly selected patients without a fistula. The size of the fistula appears to be hemodynamically insignificant in all four patients, judging from angiographic size, normal intracardiac pressures and normal cardiac output values at rest. The diagnosis of a coronary artery to right ventricle fistula is possible and should be entertained at the time of coronary angiography of heart transplant recipients. The clinical significance of the finding is unclear. As long as endomyocardial biopsy remains the diagnostic method of identifying tissue rejection, prevention of the described complication is unlikely.\r"

  ".W": "Risk stratification using clinical and historical variables plus early low level exercise testing was performed in 141 patients with a first non-Q wave myocardial infarction. The 111 patients who performed the exercise test had a 3.6% cardiac mortality rate in the first year compared with 13.3% in the 30 patients who could not exercise (p = 0.063), and a 1 year incidence rate of recurrent cardiac events (cardiac death or recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction) of 10.8% compared with 23.3% (p = 0.127). Patients who developed ischemia (ST depression or angina) during the test had an increased incidence of cardiac events in the year after the infarction (odds ratio greater than 3, p less than 0.05). When patients were subgrouped by the presence or absence of pulmonary congestion, the discriminatory value of the exercise test was seen to reside primarily in the cohort with pulmonary congestion. For example, ST depression during exercise in this group identified patients with a 71% incidence of cardiac events in the year after the infarction compared with 5.3% for those without ST depression (odds ratio 45, p = 0.002). In the patients without pulmonary congestion, the exercise test had no discriminatory value. It is concluded that early low level exercise testing has a limited role after an uncomplicated non-Q wave infarction, but is useful in patients with clinical markers of higher risk.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with diabetes mellitus experience a more adverse outcome after acute myocardial infarction compared with nondiabetic patients, although the mechanisms responsible for these findings are not clear. From the Multicenter Investigation of the Limitation of Infarct Size (MILIS) study, the course of acute infarction in 85 diabetic patients was compared with that in 415 nondiabetic patients, all of whom had serial assessments of left ventricular function. The diabetic patients experienced a more complicated in-hospital and postdischarge course than did the nondiabetic patients, including a higher incidence of postinfarction angina, infarct extension, heart failure and death, despite the development of a smaller infarct size and similar levels of left ventricular ejection fraction. Although diabetic patients had a worse profile of cardiovascular risk factors at the time of the index infarction, the increased incidence of adverse outcomes among them persisted despite adjustment for these baseline imbalances. Diabetic women had a poor baseline risk profile compared with the other groups categorized by gender and diabetic status, and experienced an almost twofold increase in cardiac mortality despite development of the smallest infarct size during the index event. The duration of diabetes and the use of insulin at the time of the index infarction were associated with a better in-hospital mortality rate, but the duration of diabetes did not exert a major influence on the outcome of the diabetic patients. The factors responsible for the increased incidence of adverse outcomes among diabetic patients may be related to an acceleration of the atherosclerotic process, diastolic left ventricular dysfunction associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy or other unidentified unfavorable processes.\r"

Legislation passed by Congress in 1986, and just recently implemented, creates an opportunity to increase Medicare funding for geriatrics. Those concerned with geriatric fellowship training must have a clear understanding of how Medicare funding for graduate medical education will occur under the new legislation if the opportunity is to be used effectively. Finally, other barriers created by general pressures on housestaff budgets that may interfere with capitalizing on the opportunity are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Progressive deposition of amyloid fibrils in senile plaques and in blood vessels is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The AD amyloid protein, called beta amyloid protein, or A4 protein, is derived from a much larger precursor protein, the gene for which has now been cloned, sequenced, and localized to chromosome 21. This chromosomal location is of great interest because it has long been known that all Down's patients over the age of 40 develop the classical neuropathological lesions of AD. An anonymous DNA marker, which segregates with cases of dominantly inherited AD, has also been found to be located on chromosome 21. It is now known, however, that this marker and the gene encoding the beta amyloid precursor protein are not tightly linked. The beta amyloid precursor protein gene appears to code for a normal cellular product whose function is not yet known. The gene is expressed not only in brain but also in many non-neural tissues. It is highly conserved in evolution. Two closely related alternative transcripts have recently been identified; these contain an insert showing homology to certain members of the Kunitz family of proteinase inhibitors. All evidence accumulated thus far suggests that the beta amyloid precursor protein gene is not abnormal in AD; therefore, recent research has focused on transcriptional, translational, or posttranslational events that may be implicated in the progressive deposition of beta amyloid protein in AD.\r"

When expressed as percentage changes, the responses to insulin, in terms of stimulation of both [U-14C]glucose oxidation and 14C-labeled lipid accumulation, were largest in fat cells from the runners, followed by the paired-weight adipocytes, and the cells from the freely eating sedentary animals. However, the absolute changes in the rates of glucose oxidation and 14C-labeled lipid synthesis produced by insulin were comparable among the different groups. Basal rates of oxidation and 14C-labeled lipid accumulation were directly correlated with average cell size, independent of the treatment group, whereas the percentage increases in these processes produced by insulin were inversely correlated with cell size. Little, if any, effect of age or exercise was observed that could not be attributed to the average fat cell volume.\r"

Chemoattractant release by BAM from adult (5-8 mos) and senescent (19-26 mos) C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice in response to both stimulants was comparable; however, the generation of chemoattractant activity by BAM from senescent (18-20 mos) BALB/c mice was greater than that observed with cells from younger (4-6 mos) animals with both zymosan and A23187. In the presence of 50 microM piriprost potassium, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, the release of chemoattractant activity and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in response to zymosan and A23187 by BAM from both groups of C57BL/6 mice was significantly impaired. With BAM from BALB/c mice, 100 microM piriprost potassium was required to produce changes in A23187-stimulated chemoattractant and LTB4 release; of note, the generation of LTB4 in response to A23187 by BAM from aged BALB/c mice was significantly greater than that observed with cells from the younger animals under all conditions studied. Finally, with BAM from DBA/2 mice, 50 microM piriprost potassium significantly reduced chemoattractant activity in both groups of animals, but the lipoxygenase inhibitor had no effect on LTB4 production. Thus, although these studies revealed substantial age and strain-related differences in the release of neutrophil chemoattractant activity by murine BAM, they did not demonstrate deficiencies that might enhance the susceptibility of the senescent host to infection of the lower respiratory tract.\r"

A significantly greater percentage of neurons were immunostained in all the brain regions (frontal, temporal, and parieto-occipital lobes and hippocampus) incubated with sera of AD patients than with sera of DS patients or of controls. This indicates that AD patients have an excess of circulating neuron-binding antibodies (NBAs), mainly reacting with cytoplasmic structures. NBAs could be either the cause or the result of the cerebral lesion found in AD. This study is not able to answer this question, but some previous data from our own and other laboratories suggest that NBAs have a role in the pathogenesis of AD lesions. Since we found no increase of NBAs in DS patients, the brain lesions in DS appear to have a different pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES) (mean LES pressure greater than 45 mm Hg; LES relaxation greater than 75%; normal peristalsis) is a poorly characterized motility disorder associated with chest pain and dysphagia. Therefore, we carried out a multidisciplinary study to assess esophageal pressures and function in 15 symptomatic hypertensive LES patients (3 men, 12 women; mean age, 53 years). On-line computer analysis showed a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in LES pressure (55.5 versus 14.9 mm Hg) and residual pressure (6.8 versus 1.1 mm Hg) as well as a decrease in percentage of LES relaxation (87 versus 93%) in patients compared with age-matched controls. All patients had normal peristalsis but 7 of 15 had nutcracker esophagus (mean distal amplitude, 216 mm Hg). No patient had evidence of impaired liquid transport on barium esophagram. The emptying of solids as assessed by radionuclide scans was normal in 14 of 15 patients. Of the 12 patients who completed both psychological inventories, nine had elevated scores on scales assessing anxiety and somatization. The heterogenous nature of this disorder is illustrated by a patient with a changeable narrowing in the distal esophagus associated with the transient impaction of a marshmallow. Dysphagia but not chest pain improved after pneumatic dilatation. We conclude that the hypertensive LES is a heterogenous disorder. Despite abnormal LES parameters, most patients have normal esophageal function, and frequent psychological abnormalities may contribute to their report of symptoms. A minority have abnormal esophageal transit.\r"

  ".W": "The results of therapeutic trials in functional dyspepsia (FD), a frequently encountered condition, are contradictory. Our aim, then, was to produce a pooled estimate, or meta-analysis, of a series of short-term randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials on the pharmacological treatment of FD with antisecretory and gastrokinetic drugs. We retrieved trials for analysis purposes by consulting computerized data bases and by scanning published reviews, Current Contents, and references cited in the individual studies. We also requested bibliographical updates from the medical departments of the manufacturers of the drugs used in the various trials. Of 74 trials retrieved by these means, 23 proved eligible for meta-analysis on the basis of six selection criteria defined a priori. Results were expressed in terms of \"therapeutic success\" (TS), which includes \"symptom-free patients,\" patients with \"significant improvement in symptoms,\" \"excellent results,\" and so on. The differences in TS rates between the various drugs and placebo were calculated in each trial as the algebraic difference together with the respective 95% confidence interval (95% C.I.); the pooling of results of all eligible trials was done using Cochran's weighted method. With antisecretory drugs, the mean difference in TS rates versus placebo was +20% (95% C.I.: 14-24%). The therapeutic gain for the respective antisecretory agents was 25% (95% C.I.: 14-36%) in the case of pirenzepine and 18% (95% C.I.: 12-24%) in the case of H2 antagonists. Meta-analysis of trials with gastrokinetic drugs also showed superior efficacy of these agents compared with placebo, with a mean difference in TS rates of +46% (95% C.I.: 40-52%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients tolerated the procedure well. At the end of the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks ulcer healing was complete in 2 (8%), 11 (42%), and 17 (65%), respectively, of the cetraxate group (26 patients); and in 8 (35%), 18 (78%), and 22 (96%), respectively, of the ranitidine group (23 patients). All the differences in the healing rates were statistically significant. Pain relief was significantly earlier with ranitidine. Incidences of side effects were similar and not serious in the two groups. The results suggest that at the doses prescribed to the elderly, ranitidine is significantly more effective than cetraxate in gastric ulcer healing and pain relief.\r"

Within a few years it was recognized that the primary process could involve any part of the ileum and jejunum. It was not until 1965, however, that Crohn's colitis was recognized in the United States. There were many reasons for the delay of nearly 35 years: accounts documenting this affliction from the early part of this century were ignored and Crohn's colitis was confused with other diseases of the large intestine. More important, authorities in the field were skeptical that Crohn's disease involved the colon and failed to investigate fully that possibility. The belief that Crohn's disease stopped at the ileocecal valve was so entrenched in American medicine that after the British first documented Crohn's colitis in 1959, it took doctors in the United States another 6 years to believe it.\r"

We review the literature on the relationship between diabetes mellitus and pancreatic carcinoma with particular emphasis on situations in which recent-onset diabetes may be a harbinger of pancreatic carcinoma. Several reports are cited in which the onset of diabetes mellitus in middle-aged patients antedated by a short time the onset of clinically recognizable pancreatic carcinoma. An otherwise silent pancreatic carcinoma may present as new-onset diabetes. Although rare, pancreatic carcinoma should be considered in a recently diagnosed middle-aged diabetic person with unusual manifestations, e.g., abdominal symptoms and continuous weight loss despite euglycemia.\r"

Of 24 patients with obstructive jaundice due to distal CBD obstruction (pancreatic carcinoma 8, periampullary cancer 5, choledocholethiasis 10, CBD stricture due to pancreatitis 1) in whom the final diagnosis was proven at laparotomy, ultrasonography revealed 11 patients to have a thin-walled distended gallbladder continuous with a dilated CBD, which was termed the \"common channel\" sign. In all 11 patients, the cause of obstruction of the lower end of CBD proved to be malignant (pancreatic carcinoma 6, periampullary 5). In contrast, only 2 of the other 13 patients with obstructive jaundice with distal CBD obstruction, but without the \"common channel\" sign, had a malignant lesion at the lower end of CBD. The positive and the negative predictive values of the common channel sign were 100% and 85%, respectively. Thus, the ultrasonographic common channel sign is a reliable and characteristic feature of distal CBD obstruction due to malignant pathology.\r"

Due to technical changes in airway management and a desire to assess their impact, this experience was compared with a previously reported series of 38 emergency cricothyrotomies from the same department. Technical changes include the use of paralyzing agents, transtracheal needle ventilation, and the use of only vertical skin incisions and #4 Shiley tubes when cricothyrotomy is performed. The presenting problem, indications for cricothyrotomy and complications of the procedure were compared between the two series. Fewer cricothyrotomies were done as a fraction of total surgical and nonsurgical tracheal intubations in the present series (1.7%) compared to the previous series (2.7%). The complication rate decreased from 40% in the previous series to 23% in the present series. Incorrect site of tube placement (10%) and hemorrhage (8%) remain the two leading complications. However, the tube was in the trachea in all cases, and acceptable ventilation was achieved. No patient developed a clinically significant hematoma or hemorrhage from cricothyrotomy. It is concluded that our technical changes in airway management have helped to decrease both the relative frequency of cricothyrotomy and the complication rate.\r"

Smokers had a higher respiratory rate 20.5 (+/- 4.0) than nonsmokers 19.3 (+/- 4.0), but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.124). It was also noted that the respiratory rate measured by the nurse was almost always different from that measured by the medical student (P less than 0.0001). Based on a review of the literature concerning what constitutes a \"normal\" respiratory rate, we conclude that the \"normal\" respiratory rate may be higher than that suggested in the medical literature.\r"
