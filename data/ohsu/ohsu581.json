Twelve (44%) of 27 patients showed test scores significantly above normal. The axes of bipolarity determined by the testing differed widely between the patients with abnormal scores, compatible with the notion that different alterations in visual pigment genes occur in different AMN kindreds. These observations confirm our earlier impression that the frequency of abnormal color vision is increased in these kindreds, and it supports our contentions that (1) AMN (and its companion, adrenoleukodystrophy) are very closely linked to the visual pigment loci at Xq28 and (2) this proximity might provide the opportunity to observe contiguous gene defects.\r"

  ".W": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multiple-anomaly disorder in which 50%-70% of cases are associated with a de novo interstitial deletion [del 15(q11-13)] on prometaphase cytogenetic analysis, the remainder having apparently normal chromosomes. In most instances, the paternally derived chromosome has become deleted in the affected child, suggesting the possibility of a predisposing environmental factor. Strakowski and Butler found an increased incidence of paternal periconceptional employment in hydrocarbon-exposing occupations in this population. This observation may suggest a causal relationship to PWS. To determine whether this association may distinguish the cytogenetically different groups, we identified 81 patients with the disorder who were physically and cytogenetically examined in three centers, and we compared the frequency of possible periconceptional occupational hydrocarbon exposure between fathers of patients who demonstrate a 15q deletion and those who do not. There was no statistically significant difference between the cytogenetically different groups. In both groups, approximately half of the fathers had been employed in hydrocarbon-exposing jobs. These findings suggest lack of etiologic heterogeneity between the cytogenetically different groups for PWS and affirm the need to seek submicroscopic deletions through molecular genetic studies. These data also provide additional evidence that hydrocarbon exposure among fathers of children with PWS may be causally related to the disorder, and they also suggest the need for more accurate assessment of exposure via a large, controlled study.\r"

Fragile-site carrier status was not determined in case or control probands. No significant excess of cancer in case relatives, compared with either control relatives or to general (SEER) population expectancies, was found. Furthermore, there was neither evidence of cancer at younger ages, when cases were compared with control relatives, nor an excess of cancer at multiple sites. Male relatives of cases did, however, show a small excess of cancer, especially in older age groups. There was a slight, but not statistically significant, excess of lung cancer in case relatives, with this deviation occurring almost exclusively in relatives of probands having rearrangements at 11q23 and having lymphoid leukemia. It is possible that heritable tendency to chromosomal rearrangement--and thus to cancer--is expressed in such a small proportion of family members that cancer excess in these families could not be detected with the numbers of relatives analyzed in this study, although there was no significant evidence for a hereditary predisposition to cancer in the families of probands with leukemia and with chromosomal rearrangements at the same apparent chromosomal location as rare fragile sites.\r"

Approximately 15% of CF patients are, however, pancreatic sufficient. To investigate whether the two clinical subgroups, PI and pancreatic sufficiency (PS), are caused by different CF mutant alleles, we have performed linkage disequilibrium and haplotype association analysis with three DNA markers that are tightly linked to the CF locus. The study showed that the allelic and haplotype distributions for these RFLPs are significantly different between the two groups. The data suggest that most of the CF-PI patients are probably descendants of a single mutational event at the CF locus and that the CF-PS patients resulted from multiple, different mutations. While final interpretation of these data awaits molecular cloning of the CF gene, the information on haplotype association in CF may be useful in genetic counseling and disease prognosis, in identifying the gene itself, and in defining the mutations.\r"

The grandpaternal origin of the duplication has been demonstrated in these families by RFLP and duplication analysis. The results suggest that unequal sister-chromatid exchange, which most likely occurred in the germ cell lineage of the proband's grandfather, is responsible for generating these duplications and that this type of intrachromosomal rearrangement, although rarely reported in humans, is not uncommon in the muscular dystrophy gene.\r"

A large survey of hemoglobinopathy, including 142,171 people and 21 national/ethnic groups, was carried out in Xinjiang and indicated Hb D-Punjab accounted for 55.6% of the total hemoglobin variants there. Here we describe a simple way--EcoRI mapping of the amplified beta-globin DNA sampling from dried blood spots on filter paper blotters--of identifying the Hb D-Punjab gene. The primers were designed and synthesized to emzymatically amplify a 144-bp fragment of beta-globin gene which included codons beta 121 (GAA) and 122 (TTC) representing an EcoRI recognition site. The Hb D-Punjab gene could be easily detected by EcoRI digestion of the amplified DNA sequence on agarose gel because of a single base change at codon 121. The analysis of amplified DNA sampling from dried blood provides a very useful method for population study of Hb D-Punjab and will be of significance for demonstration of the occurrence of the Hb D-Punjab gene and for understanding of the relations among various nationalities.\r"

We therefore conducted a prospective survey of medical inpatients to determine attitudes toward life support under differing medical outcomes, and the extent of physician communication about these issues. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 200 adult patients admitted to the general medical services at UCLA Medical Center during August and September 1987. Each patient completed a standardized 13-item questionnaire. Patients rated their agreement with life-support treatment in the context of four outcome scenarios. A five-point Lickert scale for each question was used, and an overall life-support scale was created by summing the four items. Patients were also asked about previous life-support discussions with their physicians. RESULTS: Life support was desired in 90 percent of the patients if their health could be restored to its usual level, in 30 percent if they would be unable to care for themselves after discharge, in 16 percent if their chance for recovery was hopeless, and in only 6 percent if they would remain in a vegetative state. Patients who desired less aggressive care were older, female, and more likely to have terminal illnesses. Only 16 percent reported having discussed life support with their physicians; however, an additional 47 percent desired such discussions. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized medical patients base their preferences for life support upon perceived outcomes. Lack of communication creates the potential for patients to be subjected to burdensome and expensive treatments they may not desire. We encourage physicians to offer their patients discussions about prognosis and the efficacy of life support so that disproportionate treatments can be avoided.\r"

To adjust the amount of contrast material to the severity of azotemia, we have utilized the following formula to calculate a contrast material \"limit\" in patients with renal disease: Contrast material limit = (formula; see text) PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 10-year period, 115 patients (53 men, 62 women, aged 61 +/- 11 [mean +/- SD] years) with renal dysfunction (baseline serum creatinine level greater than or equal to 1.8 mg/dL) underwent cardiac catheterization and angiography, after which the level of serum creatinine was measured daily for five days. The amount of contrast material that was given adhered to the limit in 86 patients (Group I) and exceeded it in 29 (Group II). RESULTS: Contrast-induced renal dysfunction (an increase in serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/dL) occurred in two (2%) patients in Group I and in six (21%) patients in Group II (p less than 0.001). Of the 48 patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus, the contrast limit was surpassed in 16, six (38%) of whom had contrast nephropathy. Only two of the 32 (6%) diabetic patients in whom the contrast limit was not exceeded had contrast nephropathy (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, contrast-induced renal dysfunction occurs infrequently if the amount of contrast material is limited in accordance with the degree of azotemia. Diabetic patients have a high incidence of contrast nephropathy, particularly when they receive an excessive amount of contrast. In patients with diabetes and renal impairment, it may be preferable to perform angiography as a staged procedure or to utilize alternative (non-contrast) techniques to obtain the desired information rather than to exceed the prescribed contrast limit.\r"

Concomitant diuretic therapy also produces these metabolic sequelae and may therefore precipitate cardiac arrhythmias in patients taking this combination of drugs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the electrocardiographic (ECG) effects of high-dose inhaled albuterol, and to evaluate whether potentiation occurs with bendrofluazide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten normal subjects (mean age [+/- SEM]: 29 +/- 2 years, four women, six men) received seven days of treatment with either bendrofluazide 5 mg or identical placebo in a single-blind, randomized, cross-over design, with a 10-day washout period. After each treatment period, responses (potassium, magnesium, ECG) to cumulative doubling doses of inhaled albuterol (100 micrograms to 2,000 micrograms) were measured. RESULTS: Baseline potassium levels (mean and 95% confidence intervals) were lower after pretreatment with bendrofluazide compared with placebo (3.07 mmol/L [2.89 to 3.25 mmol/L] versus 3.78 mmol/L [3.62 to 3.93 mmol/L]; p less than 0.001). The combination of bendrofluazide and albuterol produced a lower absolute level of potassium than did placebo and albuterol: (2.72 mmol/L [2.50 to 2.95 mmol/L] versus 3.18 mmol/L [3.09 to 3.27 mmol/L]; p less than 0.001). Mean (+/- SEM) potassium fell to a lower level with bendrofluazide and albuterol in women than in men (2.45 +/- 0.04 mmol/L versus 2.90 +/- 0.13 mmol/L; p less than 0.005). Albuterol alone produced a small but significant fall in magnesium (0.842 mmol/L [0.815 to 0.869 mmol/L] to 0.789 mmol/L [0.757 to 0.820 mmol/L]; p less than 0.001), but no further change after bendrofluazide. Pretreatment with bendrofluazide increased the frequency (p less than 0.001) and amplitude (p less than 0.05) of U waves due to albuterol. Albuterol also attenuated T-wave amplitude (p less than 0.001) and prolonged the Q-Tc interval (p less than 0.001), with no additive effect from bendrofluazide. ST-segment depression (p less than 0.001) occurred in five subjects who inhaled albuterol. CONCLUSION: These findings show that treatment with bendrofluazide augments the hypokalemic and ECG effects of high-dose inhaled albuterol. The arrhythmogenic potential of this interaction may be important in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic airflow obstruction, who have concomitant hypoxemia and ischemic heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Characterization of left ventricular function is important in managing patients with coronary artery disease. Although many methods are available to assess left ventricular function, most are either expensive, invasive, or both. In this study, we examined the ability of normal or near-normal resting electrocardiographic findings to predict resting left ventricular ejection fraction, measured by resting radionuclide angiography, in 874 patients with chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 4,410 Mayo Clinic patients who underwent rest and exercise radionuclide ventriculography for the evaluation of chest pain and known or suspected coronary artery disease; of these, 874 patients met the inclusion criteria for the current study. A 15-lead electrocardiogram, which was interpreted by the cardiologist or cardiology trainee working in the laboratory, was obtained at the same evaluation as the radionuclide study. RESULTS: In 590 patients with no previous history of a myocardial infarction and entirely normal resting electrocardiographic results without nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.63 +/- 0.004, and 559 patients (95%) had a normal resting ejection fraction (defined as 0.50 or more). Both nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities (p less than 0.001) and, to a lesser degree, a history of myocardial infarction (p = 0.06) were independent predictors of an abnormal resting ejection fraction. In 185 patients with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities and no history of myocardial infarction, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.61 +/- 0.009, and 85% had a normal resting ejection fraction. In 36 patients with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities and a history of myocardial infarction, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.53 +/- 0.021, and 72% had a normal resting ejection fraction. CONCLUSION: Thus, an entirely normal result on a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram in patients with suspected coronary disease but no history of a previous myocardial infarction is a reliable (95%) predictor of normal left ventricular function. If nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities are noted, particularly if there is a history of a previous infarction, the predictive value of the electrocardiographic findings is diminished.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Although transesophageal pacing has been used successfully for the interruption of cardiac arrhythmias, the efficacy of this technique for the interruption of spontaneous atrial flutter remains poorly defined. The utility of transesophageal pacing to interrupt atrial flutter that was persistent despite standard antiarrhythmic drug therapy (mean duration: 70.3 days; range: one day to more than 365 days) was studied prospectively in 39 consecutive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After written informed consent was obtained from each patient, transesophageal pacing was performed with a programmable stimulator, using the distal electrode as the cathode and the proximal electrode as the anode. All patients continued to receive a type 1 antiarrhythmic drug or amiodarone throughout the period of transesophageal pacing. The response to transesophageal pacing was classified as follows: (1) direct conversion; (2) indirect conversion; or (3) failure to interrupt atrial flutter. RESULTS: The mean stimulus amplitude and pulse duration required for atrial capture were 19.8 +/- 7.5 mA and 18.4 +/- 7.9 msec. Atrial flutter was successfully converted to sinus rhythm by transesophageal pacing in 82% of patients. In 38% of patients, atrial flutter was converted directly to sinus rhythm without another intervening arrhythmia (direct conversion). The mean pacing rate required for direct conversion was 341 +/- 27 beats/minute. In 44% of patients, the cycle length of atrial flutter was accelerated to less than 180 msec or was converted to atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm within 24 hours (mean 8.4 +/- 9.3 hours, indirect conversion). The mean pacing rate inducing accelerated atrial flutter or transient atrial fibrillation was 372 +/- 61 beats/minute (p = NS compared to direct conversion). Atrial flutter was not interrupted or atrial fibrillation was induced that did not spontaneously convert to sinus rhythm within 24 hours in an additional seven patients (18%). The underlying cardiac disease, age, previous drug therapy, atrial size, atrial flutter cycle length, history of prior atrial fibrillation, left ventricular function, and concomitant medical illnesses did not predict the efficacy of transesophageal pacing. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that transesophageal pacing is highly effective for interrupting spontaneous atrial flutter that does not terminate with standard antiarrhythmic drug therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: A series of 210 patients with Cushing's syndrome was evaluated at a single center to assess the relative values of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and lipotropin (LPH) plasma levels in the etiologic diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and in the follow-up of treated Cushing's diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: These patients included 149 patients with Cushing's diseases, 20 with adrenal tumors, and 41 with ectopic ACTH/LPH syndromes. Hormone levels were measured before therapy and during the follow-up of treated Cushing's diseases. RESULTS: ACTH and LPH plasma levels were moderately elevated in Cushing's diseases, low or undetectable in adrenal tumors, and highly elevated in ectopic ACTH/LPH syndromes, but the overlap between the three etiologic groups was less for LPH than for ACTH. LPH appeared to be as sensitive as ACTH in evaluating the outcome of trans-sphenoidal surgery and in detecting the occurrence of Nelson's syndrome after bilateral adrenalectomy. CONCLUSION: Therefore, plasma LPH determinations provide a better index than ACTH measurements, probably for technical reasons as well as because of the greater stability of LPH in blood.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Current recommendations for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and for prophylaxis against associated opportunistic infections in North America are largely based on observations of HIV infection in males. In an effort to determine whether the natural history and clinical course may be different, with implications relevant to prophylaxis against opportunistic infections, we have documented the clinical courses of the first 24 known cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in women in Rhode Island, most of whom developed Centers for Disease Control-defined AIDS before the availability of an effective antiviral agent (i.e., zidovudine) or a well-defined approach to prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (e.g., oral trimethoprimsulfa). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects in this study are 24 women with AIDS who were treated by members of the Brown University medical faculty from June 1982 through June 1988. All patients had thorough clinical evaluations and appropriate laboratory studies as they became available. All were followed at intervals no greater than two months. All opportunistic infections were treated by appropriate, specific antimicrobial therapy. When zidovudine became available, it was administered to all remaining patients in the study. All subjects were counseled about HIV infection, its modes of transmission, and the early symptoms of opportunistic infections. RESULTS: These observations yielded the following three major findings: (1) Candida esophagitis was the most common (38%) AIDS-defining event; (2) Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was less frequently the AIDS-defining event (13%) and occurred less commonly during the illness (29%) than in North American males with AIDS; (3) Of 14 women in whom the diagnosis of AIDS was established before January 1, 1987, the mean survival time after diagnosis was greater than 20 months. CONCLUSION: More information on the natural history of HIV infection in North American women is urgently needed. If more extensive data from other geographic regions confirm the observations in this study, the optimal approach to prophylaxis against opportunistic infections in women with AIDS may be substantially different from that which is most appropriate for males.\r"

  ".U": "89270572\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Community-acquired bacteremia is an easily treatable infection occurring in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although other studies have reported bacterial infections in AIDS patients, none have clearly described the clinical presentation of these patients. In this survey, we sought to define how frequently AIDS patients presented to our institution with community-acquired bacteremia; which organisms and sources of bacteremia were involved; the frequency that these patients presented with abnormal vital signs and white blood cell counts; and the in-hospital outcome of these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with AIDS hospitalized at San Francisco General Hospital in the 16 months between August 1986 and December 1987 in whom a positive blood culture was drawn within 24 hours of admission. Each of the patient's charts was reviewed for demographic data, relevant past medical history, clinical admission information, laboratory data, and discharge status. RESULTS: We identified 44 episodes of community-acquired bacteremia in 38 patients with AIDS. These episodes represented approximately 5% of the admissions of patients with AIDS. The patients were young (mean age, 38 +/- 7 years), homosexual (43 of 44), and in some cases intravenous drug users (nine of 44). On admission, only 57% of the patients were febrile (temperature greater than 38.3 degrees C) and 23% of the patients presented with normal vital signs. Twenty-seven percent were neutropenic (less than 1,000 neutrophils/mm3). The most common sources of the bacteremia were pneumonia (10), an indwelling central venous line (eight), and cellulitis (seven). A total of 14 patients had no apparent source. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli were the most common organisms. Only four of the 44 patients died during their hospitalization. CONCLUSION: We conclude that patients with AIDS and community-acquired bacteremia can present to the hospital without abnormal vital signs or white blood cell counts. Clinicians cannot depend on these data to assist them in excluding the possibility of bacteremia in patients with AIDS. In addition, due to the variety of organisms found in our survey, we recommend that broad-spectrum antibiotics should be the empiric therapy in patients with a suspected bacterial infection.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Hickman catheters are frequently used as convenient long-term venous access in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These patients seem to be at increased risk for bacterial infections of intravenous devices. The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of Hickman catheter infection in patients with AIDS as compared with that in other patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the records of 69 patients who underwent 71 consecutive Hickman catheter placements during a one-year study period. RESULTS: Forty-six Hickman catheters were inserted in 44 patients with AIDS, and 25 Hickman catheters were placed in 25 other patients. There were 18 infections: 16 occurred in patients with AIDS, and two developed in the control group (p less than 0.05). The 16 infections in AIDS were as follows: five exit site, five septicemias, two tunnel, one septic phlebitis, and three probable Hickman catheter-related. Staphylococcus aureus was responsible for 14 cases (87%); Staphylococcus epidermidis was responsible for four cases (25%). Mean onset of infection was 32 days, but seven patients were diagnosed in the first eight days after Hickman catheter insertion. Fever occurred in all patients with early infection, leukopenia was present only in three; infusion of parenteral nutrition did not increase the risk. Two early infections were fatal. The rate of Hickman catheter infection in patients with AIDS was 0.47 per 100 catheter days, as compared with 0.09 in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the need for using Hickman catheters only when absolutely indicated in patients with AIDS, since the risk of serious infectious complications appears to be high.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To our knowledge, there has been no report documenting the spectrum of peritonitis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons. We therefore analyzed our records to confirm our previous observation of a higher incidence of pseudomonal and fungal peritonitis in a group of HIV antibody-positive (HIV+) patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 22-month period, we retrospectively studied 71 patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing CAPD. Of these, seven were HIV+, five were at high risk for HIV infection but antibody-negative, and 59 were at low risk for HIV infection. Organisms isolated in episodes of peritonitis were classified microbiologically as one of the following: gram-positive, non-pseudomonal gram-negative, pseudomonal, fungal, or culture-negative. RESULTS: The total peritonitis rate was higher in both the high-risk (p less than or equal to 0.01) and the HIV+ (p less than or equal to 0.02) groups when compared with that in the low-risk population. These differences were attributable to the following: (1) the high-risk group's two-fold increase in gram-positive infections (p less than or equal to 0.01), and (2) a 24-fold increase in pseudomonal (p less than 0.001) infections and seven-fold increase in fungal (p less than 0.005) infections in the HIV+ group. These infections were invariably associated with catheter loss and frequently resulted in conversion to hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: We believe that the use of CAPD in HIV+ patients may be limited by this increased occurrence of pseudomonal and fungal peritonitis.\r"

In the tracings from the hypoxemic (n = 11) or anemic (n = 35) fetuses, there was tachycardia, baseline variability of less than 5 beats/min, and prolonged fetal heart rate decelerations. However, the sensitivity of these pathologic patterns in predicting moderate-to-severe hypoxemia or anemia was 45% and 33%, respectively. The data demonstrate a gestation-dependent maturation of both normal and pathologic fetal heart rate patterns.\r"

This was a single-blind crossover study in which two cups of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee were consumed after an overnight fast. The total maternal caffeine ingested was 454 +/- 4 mg for regular coffee and 12 +/- 0.4 mg for decaffeinated coffee. Maternal consumption of regular coffee was associated with a twofold increase in the incidence of fetal breathing activity and a significant fall in baseline fetal heart rate. Decaffeinated coffee also increased the incidence of fetal breathing activity and produced a slight reduction in fetal heart rate. These results indicate that maternal consumption of regular and decaffeinated coffee can stimulate fetal breathing. Moreover, these results suggest that caffeinated coffee can produce baseline shifts in fetal heart rate.\r"

Data were abstracted from medical records. Clinical and demographic factors that might be associated with the likelihood of having an episiotomy or experiencing a perineal laceration were examined using logistic regression. After controlling for other significant factors, women at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital were twice as likely to have an episiotomy as women at Booth Maternity Center. Use of an episiotomy was associated with a decrease in perineal lacerations of first- or second-degree, but a fourfold increase in the incidence of third-degree lacerations.\r"

One hundred fifty-six patients were divided by pelvic nodal status after surgical staging with excision of pelvic lymph nodes: group A, negative (n = 81); group B, microscopic metastases only (n = 18); group C, macroscopic nodal metastases resected (n = 48); and group D, unresectable nodal metastases (n = 9). The 5-year recurrence-free survival in group C (51%) approached that of group B (57%) and was significantly better than that of group D (0%). The groups are compared by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, grade, histology, and incidence of paraaortic metastases. Patterns of recurrence imply improved pelvic control in patients undergoing resection of pelvic nodal metastases. Surgical removal of pelvic nodal metastases before radiation therapy is recommended.\r"

Recent reviews of fetal death indicate that nearly half occur in pregnancies that are not candidates for traditional antepartum testing. We conducted a prospective evaluation of the effectiveness of a fetal movement screening program in reducing the fetal mortality rate. During a 7-month control period, 2519 deliveries occurred, no formal fetal movement assessment was done, and the fetal mortality rate was 8.7 per 1000 births. A pilot study was conducted to validate a protocol in which the patient was instructed to record the elapsed time required to appreciate 10 fetal movements. The mean time interval was 20.9 +/- 18.1 minutes (mean +/- SD). Patients in whom 2 hours elapsed without 10 fetal movements (mean +/- 5 SD) were to report to the delivery unit for further evaluation. During the study period, 1864 patients were delivered of infants and the fetal mortality rate was 2.1 per 1000 (chi 2 = 6.8, p less than 0.01). During the study period the number of antepartum tests performed increased by 13%. Interventions for fetal compromise prompted by inadequate fetal activity tripled in the study period, resulting in a drop in fetal mortality among patients with decreased movement from 44 to 10 per 1000. We conclude that the count-to-10 fetal movement screening program is simple and effective in reducing the fetal mortality rate.\r"

To determine the precise nature of these responses, we studied 50 normal term fetuses with 60 minutes of electronic antepartum fetal heart rate monitoring divided in two 30-minute segments separated by 3 seconds of vibratory acoustic stimulation. All tracings were analyzed by a programmed microcomputer. Comparison of grouped mean 30-minute values before and after vibratory acoustic stimulation showed significant increases in baseline fetal heart rate, fetal heart rate variation, frequency of accelerations exceeding 10 and 15 beats/min, duration of accelerations exceeding 15 beats/min, and frequency of decelerations after vibratory acoustic stimulation. Mean baseline fetal heart rate elevation greater than 10 beats/min occurred within 7.6 +/- 4.4 seconds in 42 of 50 fetuses and lasted for 596 +/- 531 seconds. Reactive tests increased from 35 (70%) to 47 (94%) after vibratory acoustic stimulation. Most healthy term fetuses exhibit fetal heart rate responses after differing in frequency or magnitude from spontaneous fetal heart rate changes. Vibratory acoustic stimulation may be a valid fetal assessment tool but cannot be considered the physiologic equivalent of nonstress testing.\r"

Randomization included the surgical procedure and choice of surgeon (one of the three authors). Clinical and urodynamic evaluations were repeated at 3 months and 1 year after surgery. Differences in cure rates among the three procedures at the 3-month postoperative evaluation were insignificant (82%, 84%, and 92% for the anterior colporrhaphy, Pereyra, and Burch respectively) but became statistically significant at the 1 year postoperative evaluation (cure rates of 65%, 72%, and 91% for the anterior colporrhaphy, Pereyra, and Burch respectively, p less than 0.05). In our hands the Burch procedure stabilized the urethrovesical junction and prevented its descent during straining (evaluated by a postoperative Q-tip test) more effectively than either the Pereyra or anterior colporrhaphy. No procedure resulted in severe postoperative voiding difficulties. The present prospective randomized study demonstrates that in our hands the abdominal retropubic operation for genuine stress incontinence in patients not previously operated on results in a higher cure rate when compared with anterior colporrhaphy or Pereyra procedure.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the correlates of depressive symptoms as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale during pregnancy. Between 1984 and 1987, 1014 women, primarily poor and of minority status, who attended the prenatal clinic at Boston City Hospital were interviewed and were asked to furnish urine samples that were then assayed for marijuana and cocaine metabolites. Scores on the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale ranged from 0 to 57, with a median score of 16. Depressive symptoms during pregnancy were associated with increased life stress (p less than 0.001), decreased social support (p less than 0.001), poor weight gain (p less than 0.01), and the use of cigarettes (p less than 0.001), alcohol (p less than 0.001), and cocaine (p less than 0.05). These findings are important because these health behaviors have been demonstrated to have an an adverse effect on infant outcome. Interventions to change health behaviors during pregnancy should consider a woman's affective state, social context, and mental health.\r"

In this double-blind study, 22 estrogen-deficient hysterectomized women were treated initially for six cycles with either 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens for 21 days plus a placebo during the last 10 days of each cycle or the same estrogen regimen with 10 days of 5 mg medrogestone per day. Thereafter, the treatments were crossed over for a further six cycles. Levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were determined at baseline and the last day of sixth and twelfth treatment cycles. Conjugated equine estrogen monotherapy resulted is significantly increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p less than 0.01); percent high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p less than 0.001), and high-density lipoprotein2-cholesterol (p less than 0.001), with significantly decreased total cholesterol (p less than 0.01), low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and atherogenic index (p less than 0.001). Medrogestone caused no attenuation of any of these clinically important lipoprotein changes. Therefore from the lipoprotein aspect medrogesterone is a desirable progestogen.\r"

Twenty of the fetuses underwent 63 intracardiac transfusions. A multivariance analysis for hemoglobin concentration, percentage of fetal to adult blood, and different acid-base parameters revealed a significant correlation between the presence of adult blood and a rise in PO2 (p = 0.047), but failed to demonstrate any correlation to the other studied acid-base variables. Thus the present study suggests that the fetus can compensate for the physiologic properties of adult hemoglobin that are disadvantageous to itself by increasing PO2 and thereby maintaining oxygen supply. The physiologic background and the clinical implication are discussed.\r"

Of a panel of six different purified cytokines tested, the lymphokine gamma-interferon and the monokine tumor necrosis factor significantly affected the ability of human sperm to penetrate hamster eggs. An inhibitory effect was observed when motile sperm were harvested for use in the assay by a swim-up technique after overnight incubation in low amounts of these cytokines and also when the factors were added to the cultures at the time sperm were introduced to the eggs. These data contribute further evidence that soluble factors produced by activated lymphocytes and macrophages in reproductive tissues could be significant mediators of immunologic infertility.\r"

To prevent the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, frozen semen, thawed after a 90-day quarantine, was used. The minimum standard for insemination with cryopreserved semen was a total of 24 x 10(6) motile sperm per milliliter after thawing. Fecundity was 0.12 when insemination timing was based on cervical mucus evaluation and basal body temperature charts and 0.13 when a urinary luteinizing hormone kit was also used to predict ovulation. Life table analysis with the log rank test showed no statistically significant difference in the number of cycles required to achieve conception between the group of patients using conventional methods of ovulation timing and the group of patients using the urinary luteinizing hormone kit. Urinary luteinizing hormone testing offers no advantage over conventional methods, such as cervical mucus examination and evaluation of basal body temperature, when ovulation is being timed for insemination with frozen donor semen.\r"

This study demonstrates a similar pattern of increase in cardiac output with epidural and general anesthesia and a return by 60 minutes to preoperative levels, which persisted for up to 24 hours after delivery. The applicability of this noninvasive technique can be extended in various circumstances during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and the postpartum period to further define cardiac output in pregnancy.\r"

This study tested the hypothesis that absorption of meperidine from the gluteus muscle would be impeded when compared with deltoid or intravenous administration. Five patients in labor were given 50 mg intravenously, 10 were given 50 mg in the gluteus muscle, and five were given 50 mg in the deltoid muscle. Five nonpregnant subjects served as their own controls for all three routes of administration. Blood samples were obtained at intervals after injection, meperidine was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and mean plasma levels of meperidine versus time after administration were plotted. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine whether the curves were significantly different from 30 to 150 minutes. Maternal plasma levels after gluteus injection were significantly lower than those after intravenous injection (F[1,8] = 10.53; p less than 0.01). In nonpregnant subjects, drug levels were not significantly different from 30 to 150 minutes after either gluteus or intravenous injection. Plasma levels after deltoid injection were always higher than those after gluteus injection in both pregnant and nonpregnant subjects (F[1,8] = 9.7; p less than 0.02; F[1,8] = 14.5; p less than 0.004). These findings support impaired absorption of drugs from the gluteus muscle and suggest the deltoid muscle as the favored intramuscular site during labor.\r"

These women accurately estimated the risk for major malformation in the general population (5.6% +/- 1.3%). The tendency to terminate pregnancy when exposed to a nonteratogen significantly decreased after the consultation. Eleven patients exposed to drugs known to be teratogenic assigned a risk of 36.2% +/- 11.7% before the interview and did not change their perception thereafter (36.7% +/- 15.8%). Similarly, their tendency to continue or terminate pregnancy did not change; three of them eventually chose to terminate the pregnancy. Advising women about their teratogenic risk early in pregnancy may prevent unjustified termination of many pregnancies and may help to inform women exposed to proven teratogens about the known risk.\r"

Immunohistochemically, CA 125 and CA 19-9 were localized in the cytoplasm of decidua cells and amnion epithelial cells but not in the chorion and placental tissue. Biochemically, the 12,000 X g supernatant fractions of decidua and amnion tissues contained relatively large amounts of CA 125 and CA 19-9, 73% to 96% of which was present in the cytosolic fractions of these tissues. The CA 125 levels in the amniotic fluid decreased, whereas those of CA 19-9 increased with gestation, which correlated well with the respective levels in amnion tissues. These findings suggest that amnion cells produce and secrete these glycoproteins into the amniotic cavity. However, it is possible that the decidua also secretes CA 125 into the amniotic cavity through the chorion and amnion such as in the case of prolactin.\r"

Chronically instrumented fetal lambs were subjected to reproducible hypoxia by reduction of the maternal placental blood flow. This was achieved by complete obstruction of the maternal aorta for 60 seconds. The fetuses were divided into an immature (119 to 126 days, n = 10) and a mature group (129 to 141 days, n = 6). Both groups of fetuses had a marked fall in oxygen tension (from 2.43 +/- 0.12 to 1.46 +/- 0.12 and 2.22 +/- 0.15 to 1.11 +/- 0.17 kilopascals [kPa] in the immature and mature groups, respectively) and in oxygen saturation (from 48% +/- 3% to 17% +/- 2% and 49% +/- 3% to 15% +/- 3%, respectively), but only modest changes occurred in pH and carbon dioxide tension. Basal fetal catecholamine concentrations did not differ between the groups but increased more significantly in the mature group with acute hypoxia. An increase in the T wave amplitude of the fetal electrocardiogram occurred in both groups during the latter part of occlusion with peak values shortly after removal of the occlusion. A linear correlation was found between the plasma epinephrine concentration and the T/QRS ratio in the mature group. Fetuses in both groups showed a marked bradycardia of similar magnitude during the occlusion but differed during the early phase of heart rate recovery by a slower acceleration of heart rate in the mature group. In connection with this marked bradycardia, the mature group showed a significant rise in mean arterial blood pressure at end of the occlusion. We suggest that fetal maturity has a significant influence no only on the release of catecholamines during nonacidemic hypoxia but also on the cardiovascular reaction pattern and changes in the ST waveform.\r"

In tissue sections of the globes, neuronal-specific enolase was present in the cells of the anterior region of the meshwork and those of the inner uveal beams. The cells of the posterior region of the meshwork stained variably with antiserum against neuronal-specific enolase. Cultured trabecular cells were initially neuronal-specific enolase-positive, but became negative after 18 to 21 days in vitro. The addition of nerve growth factor restored the expression of neuronal-specific enolase in these cultured cells. Because the presence of neuronal-specific enolase in normal cells is believed to indicate their differentiation from neuroectoderm, our results provide evidence that the trabecular cells in human eyes are derived from the embryonic neural crest. Our finding also supports the hypothesis that abnormal migration or a defective terminal induction of the neural crest cells has a role in certain ocular diseases that are characterized by chamber angle anomalies or primary glaucoma.\r"

The one-hour change in pressure was highly correlated between the two eyes (r = .794, P less than .0001). Intraocular pressure was reduced (P less than .0001) one, two, and three years after treatment in both the first and second-treated eyes.

Responses were received from 333 (83%). Sixty patients reported 43 nonbasal cell second primary cancers, which were confirmed pathologically or by physician records. The overall prevalence of nonbasal cell cancers diagnosed in uveal melanoma patients by December 1985 was over two times greater than the expected prevalence, based on the Connecticut Tumor Registry data for an age- and sex-matched population. Gynecologic cancers tended to be more common in uveal melanoma female patients than in the comparison population. Although the observed prevalence of cutaneous melanoma was not significantly greater than expected, three cases with both primary cutaneous and uveal melanoma were reported. Family histories of cutaneous melanoma were confirmed in 14 patients, and uveal melanoma in two patients. Data suggested that the overall cancer prevalence in uveal melanoma patients may be increased, that hormonal factors may play a role in the genesis of this malignancy, and that there may be a link between cutaneous and uveal melanoma.\r"

The proliferative responses to the 2G11 (p22) toxoplasma membrane antigen approached that of a crude antigen preparation of Toxoplasma gondii, whereas the response to the 1E11 immunodominant p30 membrane antigen was considerably less striking. HLA typing was also performed, and none correlated to S-antigen or toxoplasma reactivity. The evidence strongly suggests that patients with a clearly infectious ocular disorder may have part of their disease mediated by a putative autoimmune mechanism. An immune response to the 2G11 toxoplasma antigen may increase the risk of developing ocular disease or a substrain of toxoplasma with 2G11 as its immunodominant membrane antigen may have a greater affinity for the retina.\r"

When hypnosis was used to intensify attention to the stimulus, there was an increase in P100 amplitude. These findings are consistent with observations that highly hypnotizable individuals can reduce or eliminate pain by using purely cognitive methods such as hypnosis.

Private family planning offers easier access, greater convenience, and higher satisfaction, albeit at almost double the cost. Clinic usage is influenced by lack of a regular source of medical care and lack of insurance coverage more than poverty level per se. Clinic patients report greater patient education regarding contraceptive methods, but less general medical care during clinic visits. They are more likely than private patients to express a desire for a different source of family planning care.\r"

Physical ability was associated with lower risk of death over two years mean follow-up; Relative odds (RO) = .4 (95 percent confidence interval = .4, .6) and in survivors, lower utilization of hospitals RO = .4 (CI = .3, .7), physicians RO = .6 (CI = .5, .8) and nursing homes RO = .3 (CI = .2, .5) compared with those having difficulty on any of the four functional measures included in the definition of physical ability. Fifty percent of the women and 42 percent of the men physically able at the time of the baseline survey in 1984 remained physically able at follow-up. Continued physical ability in this group was associated with never having had cardiovascular disease RO = 2.1, (CI = 1.2, 3.7), never having had arthritic complaints RO = 1.9 (CI = 1.2, 2.7), a body mass index less than the 75th percentile RO = 1.8 (CI = 1.2, 2.9), younger age (for each decade of age, RO = 2.0 (CI = 1.1, 3.6), and higher level of education (greater than 13 years versus 0-6 years) RO = 2.4 (CI = 1.2, 4.7).

A scale of physical functioning was developed from a comprehensive set of questionnaire items which assessed the full spectrum of physical functioning. Those scoring in the top 20 percent, defined as healthy aging, were compared to the remainder of the cohort, including those who died and those with lower levels of functioning at follow-up. After adjustment for age and functional status at baseline, the following variables were predictive of high functioning at follow-up 19 years later: race (those not Black), higher family income level, absence of hypertension, absence of arthritis, absence of back pain, being a non-smoker, having normal weight, and consuming moderate amounts of alcohol. Sex did not predict high function because of the counterbalancing effects of higher survival in females but greater likelihood of high functioning among surviving males.\r"

The age-adjusted odds ratio of death during 1976-82 in women with natural menopause before age 40 was 1.95 (95% confidence interval = 1.24, 3.07), compared to the reference group of women reporting natural menopause at ages 50 to 54.

Among 3,166 White, 55- to 100-year-old, surgically-postmenopausal, Adventist women, there was no relation between age at surgical menopause and mortality.

Thirty per cent of those who were offered mammography initially declined the offer and 40 per cent were subsequently unable to complete the procedure. Patient interviews were used to derive 27 potential knowledge and health belief predictor scales. In multiple regression analysis, two health belief scales and two knowledge scales accounted for 15 per cent of the observed variance in the model of acceptance. The strongest predictor of subsequent completion was initial acceptance. The presence of breast symptoms and two health belief scales together with initial acceptance accounted for 26 per cent of variance in the model of completion. These results suggest that the successful accomplishment of mammography requires coordinated efforts at the level of the provider, patient, and setting. Health beliefs may influence the patient's behavior in this process, but their effect appears to be modest.\r"

Among 5,138 men and 7,407 women 25-74 years old, for nonrecreational activity we observed increased risk of cancer among inactive individuals compared to very active persons (for men, relative risk [RR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 2.4; for women RR 1.3, 95% CI = 1.0, 1.8). These findings were unchanged after adjustment for cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI), and other potential confounders. Sites which demonstrated stronger inactivity-cancer associations included colorectum (RR 1.6, 95% CI = 0.7, 3.5) and lung (RR 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2, 3.5) among men, and breast (post-menopausal) (RR 1.7; 95% CI = 0.8, 2.9) and cervix (RR 5.2; 95% CI = 1.4, 14.5) among women, although these findings for women were based on relatively few cases. The association between inactivity and cancer was greater among persons of moderate (or lower) BMI, those cases occurring three or more years after baseline, and, in women, those more than 60 years old. In contrast, recreational exercise showed little relation to cancer, with the exception of prostate cancer. The results suggest that inactive individuals are at increased risk of cancer.\r"

Native Americans were more likely readmitted to hospital for surgical complications than non-Natives and this held true after controlling for age, sex, rural versus urban residence, teaching versus non-teaching hospital, multiple discharge diagnoses or complex versus simple cholecystectomy (relative odds 1.46, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.17, 1.18). The explanation for the relatively high rates of cholecystectomy among Native American females may be related to high rates of known risk factors for gallstone disease (such as obesity and high parity). However, the higher rates of surgical complications require further study.\r"

The crude odds ratio for aphakic patients was 4.6 (95% CI = 2.5, 8.6). The association remained after controlling for age, sex, and systolic blood pressure (a common risk factor) in a logistic regression model. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that light-induced damage may contribute to both lens and retinal disease and suggest that cataract extraction without implantation of ultra-violet/blue light absorbing intraocular lens may place subjects at increased risk of AMD.\r"

  ".W": "Gymnast wrist pain syndrome presents a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. It is common and debilitating among gymnasts, resulting in a reduction in training and performance, and may be the result of a response to repetitive trauma during the period of growth and development. This study was undertaken to define and characterize factors contributing to the causes and development of gymnast wrist pain and to establish an effective means of systematic and comprehensive evaluation and treatment. Thirty-eight collegiate gymnasts (20 UCLA: 9 female, 11 male; 18 NCAA: all male) were evaluated by radiograph and questionnaire. Seventy-five percent (22) of the males and 33% (3) of the females had had wrist pain for at least 4 months. The UCLA males averaged 2.82 +/- 1.94 mm positive ulnar variance; this was significantly greater than that of the NCAA males, who averaged 1.28 +/- 1.02 mm (P less than 0.02). The UCLA females averaged 1.44 +/- 1.88 mm positive ulnar variance. All of the gymnasts had significantly greater variance than had the controls, who averaged -0.52 mm (P less than 0.0001). The pommel horse routine was consistently responsible for wrist pain among the males. Anatomical and histological correlation of cryosections with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to establish the usefulness of MRI in the diagnosis of wrist pain. MRI was able to differentiate the complex transitions between cortical and trabecular bone, articular surfaces, the ligaments, and the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) complex of the wrist joint. A therapeutic algorithm was established to facilitate the evaluation and management of gymnast wrist pain. Arthroscopic surgery was successful, and arthroscopic findings correlated well with those of MRI and arthrography. Prospective studies are now underway in the pediatric and adolescent population to define further the causes and development of wrist pain problems in gymnasts.\r"

Our material comprises 749 patients who had 832 tendon ruptures treated surgically between 1972 and 1985. There were no competitive athletes among the patients studied. There were 292 single ruptures of the Achilles tendon, 274 of the proximal biceps brachii, 113 of the extensor pollicis longus, and 70 of other tendons. Forty-eight patients had multiple ruptures and 35 patients had reruptures. Achilles tendon ruptures often occurred in recreational sports activities (59%), in contrast to other tendon ruptures (2%; P less than 0.001). The mean age for patients who had Achilles tendon rupture was 35.2 years and for patients with other ruptures, 50.7 years (P less than 0.001). There was a connection between the high incidence of blood group O and tendon ruptures (P less than 0.001). In cases of multiple ruptures and reruptures, the frequency of blood group O was 71%. Sixty-two point three percent of the patients with Achilles tendon rupture were professionals or white collar workers, which is markedly more than in the Hungarian population (12.7%; P less than 0.001). Two hundred and six Achilles tendon ruptures were studied histologically, and all cases displayed pathological alterations. The results indicate that complete rupture of the Achilles tendon is usually a sequel to a sedentary life-style and participation in sports activities.\r"

Twenty-six randomly selected patients undergoing this procedure were compared to a control group consisting of 28 patients having the identical procedure in which the Hot/Ice unit was not used postoperatively. The initial ACL injury in both groups was sports related with the exception of three patients whose injury occurred while on the job. The Hot/Ice Thermal Blanket consists of two rubber pads (blankets) connected by a hose to the main cooling unit. The pads were applied to either side of the operated knee in the operative suite. The pads received fluid which was circulated from the main unit. The temperature of the fluid was set at 50 degrees in the recovery room and the unit was run continuously until the time of discharge, which was approximately 4 days. Hot/Ice patients required 53% less injectable Demerol and 67% less oral Vistaril than patients in the control group. Hot/Ice patients had made the conversion from injectable to oral pain medication an average of 1.2 days sooner than did their non-Hot/Ice counterparts. There was no appreciable difference in length of hospital stay. Physical therapy and nursing records documented a greater percentage of compliant patients in the Hot/Ice group. According to these records the Hot/Ice patients were more helpful in self-assistance, were out of bed and ambulating in the halls more quickly, and did their range of motion exercises with greater ease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We analyzed the amount and direction of tibial rotation that occurred at the knee joint with a triaxial electrogoniometer on 11 male subjects who performed the sidestep cutting manoeuvre. The mean total tibial rotation was 19.84 +/- 5.63 degrees and the mean maximum point of internal tibial rotation occurred at 34.77 +/- 5.30% of the stance phase. However, greater values for internal tibial rotation occurred in the swing phase in association with a greater angle of knee flexion. Therefore, in our subjects, during the sidestep cutting manoeuvre, internal tibial rotation did occur at the knee but was not maximal. Under normal circumstances when performing the sidestep cutting manoeuvre, maximum internal tibial rotation does not occur and so the ACL is not placed under excessive strain in such a manoeuvre. If the ACL ruptures during a sidestep cutting manoeuvre then a possible cause may be the athlete's loss of the ability to control internal tibial rotation of the knee.\r"

Two hypotheses were investigated that provided evidence that rowing ergometers are valid simulators of actual rowing and that the trunk segment is the major contributor to the total linear oar velocity. Thirty subjects were filmed rowing on-water and on an ergometer. The film was digitized for X and Y coordinates of the body joint locations for a cycle of rowing from catch to finish. A model of rowing was designed such that the rowing movement could be defined as comprising two closed vector loops. The digitized data were fitted to the vector loop model to derive kinematic variables from the drive phase of rowing. Five kinematic variables that described the contributions of five body segments to the total linear oar velocity were analyzed statistically to find differences in the patterns of on-water and ergometer rowing. The results indicated that the kinematics of the upper arm and forearm segments were significantly different in the two types of rowing. These differences were of minor importance because of the small contributions made by the arms at the catch. The differences at the finish were a result of the lifting of the oar from the water not exhibited in ergometer rowing. The vector loop analysis provided the major finding that the trunk segment contributed significantly more to the drive phase portion of the rowing cycle for both on-water and ergometer rowing although the legs initiated the drive phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Followup of the first 30 patients on whom we used the procedure shows excellent postoperative range of motion (average loss: 2 degrees of flexion, 1 degree of abduction, 4 degrees of external rotation in adduction, and 7 degrees of external rotation in abduction) and return to sports (90%, of which 70% returned to their previous level). There is, however, an unacceptably high recurrence rate of 13%, all of which occurred early in the series. Technical refinement and experience have apparently reduced the recurrence rate without sacrifice of range of motion or functional ability.\r"

Each patient had a clinical examination preoperatively and under anesthesia and instrumented examination using the MedMetric KT-1000 arthrometer, Stryker knee laxity tester, and Genucom knee analysis. The diagnosis was confirmed by arthrotomy or arthroscopy. Thirty had acute knee injuries (within 2 weeks), 9 had subacute (2 weeks to 3 months), and 11 had chronic injuries. The surgical findings demonstrated that five had other maladies, but no cruciate ligament tears. Two had a partial ACL tear, and the remaining 43 patients had at least one cruciate tear. The preoperative clinical examination for cruciate ligament integrity was completely correct in 92%, correct but incomplete in 6%, and incorrect in 2%. Examination under anesthesia was correct in 98%, the KT-1000 was correct in 75% (involved knee minus noninvolved knee was greater than or equal to 3 mm laxity equal to ACL tear), the Stryker was correct in 75%, and Genucom in 70%. The average laxity of those with ACL tears was 4.4 mm with the KT-1000, 4.6 mm with the Stryker, and 2.0 mm with the Genucom. The methods of testing with the Stryker and the KT-1000 are similar and the laxity recorded in patients with a torn ACL were almost identical. However, the KT-1000 can be used to identify the quadriceps neutral position and therefore more accurately determine PCL instability. The Genucom has the most versatility, but the laxity recorded in patients with a torn ACL was significantly lower than the other devices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using culture medium containing either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or our recently developed serum-free, defined culture medium (DM), we have demonstrated the ability of meniscal fibrochondrocytes from intact rabbit menisci to extricate themselves from their surrounding matrix and migrate into an exogenous, purified fibrin clot in vitro. After 4 weeks of culture in FBS-containing medium, the cells which had invaded the clot had initiated the early aspects of a typical reparative response; the same response did not occur in DM alone. Morphologically, the cells on the surface of the clot resembled the original superficial fibrochondrocytes, whereas those cells within the substance of the clot more closely resembled the original deep fibrochondrocytes. After 10 weeks, the reparative response had progressed only to a certain point and then failed to progress further under these culture conditions. However, use of this culture system should now make it possible to rapidly identify and quantitate those factors which would most likely be useful in continuing the reparative response and in affecting meniscal wound repair. Elucidation of the mechanisms and requirements for meniscal healing will eventually allow the practicing orthopaedic surgeon to effect in situ meniscal repair and obviate the need for meniscectomy and its morbid sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "Most authors advocate repair of the acutely ruptured ACL by augmentation or some form of primary reconstruction. Strong autogenous tissues like the patellar and semitendinosus tendons and the iliotibial band are often used when augmentation is the surgical choice. This paper describes a surgical procedure using a strip of the longitudinal patellar retinaculum as an augmentation of the repaired ACL. The retinaculum adds stability and strength to the repaired ACL during the healing period. Moreover, the retinaculum may enhance the healing process of the ruptured ACL by revascularization. It may also increase the stimulation of synovial tissue proliferation over the repaired ACL. Twenty-eight patients have been clinically and objectively evaluated at a mean follow-up time of 78 months (range, 63 to 94 months). The patients' own evaluation of their knee function was excellent or good in 86% (24 patients). Eighty-two percent (23 patients) could return to their preinjury activities at the same intensity level as before injury, whereas at an intermediate followup at 18 months only 64% (18 patients) had done so. Anterior tibial displacement was objectively evaluated at both followups by means of the anterior drawer test, with 20 degrees to 30 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion, in a testing device. The operated knee usually showed a tendency to a slightly increased anterior displacement when compared with the uninjured knee. The repair of a ruptured ACL with an augmentation using the longitudinal patellar retinaculum has been shown to give good results after more than 5 years.\r"

Twenty physicians were tested on a knee phantom, for force used during testing for the anterior drawer sign. The force used averaged 109 N (range, 70 to 180 N). Fifteen patients were examined by stress radiography. Radiographs were taken with the knee flexed to 90 degrees (the drawer test position) and with the knee flexed to 15 degrees (the Lachman position). A comparison was made between the laxity measured on forward traction in the relaxed knee, and during traction while the patient was instructed to counteract the forward displacement of the tibia by tensing the hamstrings, thus simulating muscular defense. The test procedure was executed first with 80 N and then with 160 N applied. The opposing effect of tensing the hamstrings on the anterior shift of the tibia was significantly less at 15 degrees of knee flexion (with 80 N, P less than 0.02; with 160 N, P less than 0.05) than at 90 degrees. With the hamstrings tensed and the knee flexed to 90 degrees, no statistically significant gain in drawer sign was achieved by increasing the force from 80 to 160 N. With the knee in the Lachman position, increasing the force produced a significantly greater anterior drawer sign (P less than 0.01).\r"

The total graft forces generated in the two segment and three segment composite reconstructions during this immediate postoperative state were highly variable when compared to the normal ACL in each specimen, and were irreproducible among the five specimens. Load sharing among the graft components occurred and was also variable in both reconstructions, with this variation being greater in the three segment graft. The LAD carried an average of 45% of the total graft force in the three segment graft and 28% in the two segment graft. Further work is required to clarify the source of the variability in the total graft force and load sharing observed in this study.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen male patients who had untreated chronic ACL rupture were studied in order to evaluate thigh muscle size, morphology, and isokinetic performance of the quadriceps muscle. Computed tomography disclosed a 5.1% mean atrophy of the quadriceps (P less than 0.05), 2.1% slight hypertrophy of the hamstrings (P less than 0.05), and also nonsignificant changes of all other muscle areas of the injured thigh. Muscle morphology (m. vastus lateralis) was normal in 11 biopsy specimens, whereas minor abnormalities (irregular shape or hypotrophy) could be seen in the rest. Isokinetic mechanical output of the knee extensors was 71% to 87% of that of the noninjured limb (P less than 0.01), and the mechanical output corrected for differences in quadriceps cross-sectional area was significantly lower in the injured than the uninjured limb. As there were no significant correlations between isokinetic performance and muscle size or qualitative morphology or morphometric data, the strength decrease cannot be explained by muscle atrophy or structural changes per se. We conclude that nonoptimal activation of the muscles during voluntary contractions is probably the most important causative mechanism of the strength decrease found in patients who have chronic symptomatic ACL tear.\r"

In the present study, patients treated nonoperatively were evaluated retrospectively 4 to 10 years after ACL tears were documented by arthroscopy and by mild to moderate pivot shifts under anesthesia. Forty-nine patients who underwent arthroscopic evaluation of the knee between 1976 and 1982 were found to have complete tears of the ACL. A mild to moderate pivot shift was present under anesthesia. One or both menisci were torn in two-thirds of the knees, requiring partial meniscectomies. The average age of the patients was 27 years (range, 16 to 46 years). Because of persistent disabling instability, 9 patients (18%) underwent late ACL reconstruction. The remaining 40 patients were evaluated at an average of 5.6 years after documentation of the tear (range, 4 to 10 years). At followup, 25 (62%) of the 40 patients had satisfactory subjective results. Eight of the patients (20%) had returned to their preinjury level of athletic activities without restrictions, and 10 (25%) functioned at the same level but with symptoms, some patients requiring bracing. Seventeen patients (43%) had diminished their level of sports activities, while 5 patients (12%) had given up all sports. Only 2 patients required late meniscectomies. On physical examination, 27 patients (87%) had pivot shifts. Instrumented laxity testing revealed an injured to normal difference of 3.1 mm with a 20 pound force. Radiographic studies were interpreted as normal in 35% of the knees, whereas 65% demonstrated mild degenerative changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The procedures were performed on a same day basis without a pneumatic tourniquet. The operative record of each patient was reviewed to determine postoperative diagnosis and treatment. The data was matched to a patient questionnaire that measured individual reaction to local anesthesia. The effectiveness and level of patient acceptance of this anesthetic technique for operative arthroscopy was then evaluated. Ninety-one patients responded to the questionnaire, 82 of whom had prior anesthetic experience. Ninety-five percent of the patients had minimal or no discomfort during the procedure. Eighty percent indicated a preference for local anesthesia in the event of subsequent arthroscopy. No complications relating to the anesthetic agent were noted. Arthroscopy of the knee under local anesthesia for routine operative arthroscopy was found to be safe, reliable, practical, and to have a high patient acceptance rate.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic studies were conducted during the period 1986-1988 in a small rural community in Colombia (El Callejon) where visceral leishmaniasis is highly endemic. In this community of 185 people, 14 cases of infantile visceral leishmaniasis were diagnosed in the 9 years 1981-1988. Leishmanin skin testing of a sample of the human residents showed that prevalence of Leishmania chagasi infection increased with age; overall, 51.2% of the subjects had a positive reaction. A canine surveillance program was instituted, using introduced sentinel dogs as well as the indigenous dog population. Eleven of 16 sentinel dogs were infected within 8 months of exposure; mean seroconversion time was 4.4 months. Eleven of 25 seronegative local dogs were also infected during the 26 month period; mean seroconversion time was 8 months. Parasites identified by isozyme electrophoresis as L. chagasi were recovered from 18 of 22 seropositive dogs. Collections of wild animals using baited live traps yielded mainly the neotropical opossum, Didelphis marsupialis. Leishmania chagasi was recovered from 12 of 37 (32.4%) opossums. Six of 681 female Lutzomyia longipalpis collected in the community had flagellates in their guts; cultures from 4 were identified as L. chagasi. These data confirmed that active parasite transmission occurred. The relatively high prevalence of L. chagasi infection found among D. marsupialis captured near human dwellings suggests that these animals may be an important peridomestic reservoir.\r"

CT at 6 weeks post-treatment revealed a reduction in size and increased calcification of abdominal cysts as compared to pretreatment CT. Cyst fluid antigens in ELISA assays showed a high titer (1:5, 120) IgG response in the langur serum, while no IgM response could be detected. No decrease in IgG titer was seen 6 weeks after treatment.

No significant differences in infection or dissemination rates were detected among Ae. fowleri and Cx. pipiens feeding to repletion on immune hamsters before or after feeding to repletion on a viremic hamster. Similarly, no significant differences in infection, dissemination, or transmission rates were observed among Ae. fowleri and Cx. pipiens feeding to repletion on immune hamsters or nonimmune (control) hamsters 0 or 24 hr after inoculation with RVF virus. Infection rates were significantly higher for Ae. fowleri (56/66, 85%) and Cx. pipiens (123/148, 83%) fed only on viremic hamsters than for those interrupted to complete feeding on an immune hamster (Ae. fowleri [24/49, 59%], Cx. pipiens [66/131, 50%]) or a nonimmune hamster (Ae. fowleri [32/51, 63%], Cx. pipiens [69/127, 54%]). However, no significant differences were detected in infection, dissemination, or transmission rates among Ae. fowleri, Ae. mcintoshi or Cx. pipiens fed on a viremic hamster and interrupted to complete feeding on an immune vs. a nonimmune hamster. Results from interrupted feeding experiments were significantly different from pledget feeding experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, vertical transmission rates (the percentage of parent females transmitting to progeny) varied (12-100%). Filial infection rates (the percentage of progeny infected) for a given mosquito virus combination were markedly affected by the interval of time between parental infection and oviposition, suggesting that vertical infection was not transovarial in nature but occurred at oviposition. Filial infection rates for Cx. tritaeniorhynchus also varied widely by family and, as measured in F1 larvae, rates in excess of 20% were observed in a family. Filial infection rates in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus F1 adults were about 4 times lower than those in larvae.

The clinical criteria was that the clinical course was free of sepsis. Half of the group thus identified had severe pancreatitis as defined as having three or more poor prognostic signs. Fever, leukocytosis, and serum amylase elevation persisted for a longer period than usual. Complication was infrequent but the lesion could persist for 3 to 4 months without producing symptoms.

Twenty-four hour pretreatment with either muramyl dipeptide alone or cefoxitin alone was associated with survival rates of 43 percent and 56 percent, respectively. When muramyl dipeptide was given with cefoxitin at the time of administration of the bacterial inoculum, no survival advantage was seen over the use of cefoxitin alone. There were no significant differences among groups in quantitative bacteremia at 24 hours postinoculation or in the number of intraabdominal abscesses. This study clearly demonstrates an additive effect of muramyl dipeptide pretreatment given with a prophylactic dose of cefoxitin in a human fecal peritonitis rat model.\r"

Patients with papillary adenocarcinoma showed a 3-year survival rate of 75 percent, which was better than those with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with no 2-year survivors. Infiltration to the serosa of the bile duct, lymph node metastasis, and vascular invasion were important prognostic factors, since the survival was better for the patients without than those with these factors. Among patients with papillary adenocarcinoma, none had hepatic infiltration and lymph node metastasis and most had no infiltration to the serosa. Patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, in contrast, had extensive association of those prognostic factors. Seventy-five percent of the patients with papillary adenocarcinoma and only 22 percent of patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma were considered to have curative resection. These findings suggest that the histologic type strongly influenced the prognosis of the patients with carcinoma of the upper bile duct and can be used for the determination of the extent of this tumor.\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively studied 20 patients with cystic fibrosis who underwent surgery for gallbladder disease from 1973 to 1986. A long delay between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis was noted (mean 7.4 months). This delay was attributed to masking of the symptoms of biliary disease by the malabsorption and pulmonary symptoms seen in this patient population. There was a notable lack of common bile duct disease in our patients as well as in those reported in the literature. This may have been due to a combination of factors: the increased viscosity of the mucus, the small caliber of the gallbladder and ductal system, and the hypotonicity of the gallbladder. We do not recommend routine intraoperative cholangiography in patients with cystic fibrosis and gallbladder disease. Cystic fibrosis is a disease with progressive pulmonary deterioration. Cholecystectomy can be performed in these patients with relative safety if careful preoperative and postoperative care is provided. We recommend early operative intervention in the patient with gallbladder disease and cystic fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of quinacrine, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor, and enzymatic scavengers of active oxygen metabolites (superoxide dismutase and catalase) on ischemic small intestinal mucosal damage has been investigated. In the absence of an inhibitor, ischemia and reperfusion caused increased mucosal permeability to sodium fluorescein, increased N-acetyl-glucosaminidase release from the mucosa into the lumen, increased malondialdehyde content, and increased myeloperoxidase and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities in the mucosa. All these effects of ischemia were efficiently inhibited by the PLA2 inhibitor quinacrine. On the other hand, superoxide dismutase together with catalase, even if it totally prevented the increased formation of malondialdehyde, was only able to reduce 50 percent of the increases of the other parameters. These findings indicate that, in addition to free radicals, other factors are involved in the pathogenesis of small intestinal mucosal injury after ischemia and reperfusion. We suggest that one such factor is the activation of PLA2 and the generation of various PLA2-dependent compounds such as arachidonic acid metabolites, lysophosphatidyl choline, and platelet-activating factor.\r"

  ".W": "We performed a multivariate analysis of survival data from 278 patients who underwent potentially curative anterior resection with hand-sewn anastomosis for nonobstructing colorectal carcinoma to evaluate the interaction of the resection margin with distance from the anal verge and their contributions to local and distant recurrence. Cumulative 5-year disease-free survival was 66 percent for the 258 patients with complete follow-up. Forty-nine patients (19 percent) had local recurrence and 42 (16 percent) developed initial distant metastases. Local recurrence rates increased with increasing age and with more advanced Dukes' stage. It developed in twice as many patients with colostomies as without colostomies. Distant metastases developed significantly more often in patients with nodal involvement and in patients with resection margins exceeding 3.5 cm. Forty-four percent of patients with lesions within 14 cm of the anal verge resected with margins of at least 3.5 cm developed distant recurrence. This study suggests that aggressive pelvic dissection to achieve resection margins greater than 3.5 cm may contribute to tumor dissemination and subsequent distant metastases.\r"

The extent of in situ carcinoma and presence of multifocality were positive predictors of survival, and perineural invasion and nodal involvement on clinical examination were negative predictors. None of the other parameters used in this study attained statistical significance. We conclude that the histologic grade traditionally used to predict clinical behavior may not be useful. Clinical stage, particularly nodal status; perineural invasion; and the multifocal or in situ disease, should be considered in pathologic reports to provide better prognostic profile in oropharyngeal carcinoma.\r"

Cardiac experience with tissue valves suggests the potential for their use in more peripheral locations. The current initial work evaluated 22 valvular xenografts placed in the inferior vena cavas of 22 dogs. Patency extended to 28 months in 12 valves. There was a plausible explanation for failure in 8 of the 10 unsuccessful units. Patent valves functioned with minimal pressure gradients at moderate flow with no evidence of pulmonary emboli. Retrograde valvulograms showed acceptable functional competence in six of eight units examined despite autopsy evidence of leaflet fibrosis and anatomic incompetence. The study establishes the feasibility of long-term patency of valvular xenografts in the inferior vena cava, but also raises questions concerning design requirements for prosthetic venous valves.\r"

The efficiency of delivery was also affected by whether the MDI was activated before or after initiation of gas flow through the ETT, with activation into a flowing stream significantly more efficient. The authors conclude that an MDI can deliver a dose of drug to the trachea, but delivery efficiency is lower than reported for MDI delivery in spontaneously breathing patients.\r"

Six healthy volunteers were studied first while awake and breathing spontaneously and again while anesthetized-paralyzed and their lungs ventilated mechanically. Tidal volume (VT) and respiratory frequency were similar during both conditions. Three subjects were studied while they were supine and three while they were prone. During spontaneous breathing, movement of dependent diaphragm regions was greater than that of nondependent regions in four of six subjects. In five of the six subjects, dorsal diaphragm movement exceeded ventral movement regardless of body position. The volume displaced by the diaphragm (delta Vdi) was similar to VT in supine subjects but tended to be less than VT in prone subjects. After induction of anesthesia-paralysis, the end-expiratory position of the diaphragm did not change consistently in supine subjects, whereas a consistent cephalad volume shift occurred in prone subjects. During anesthesia-paralysis and mechanical ventilation, delta Vdi was reduced to approximately 50% of VT in both body positions. In the supine position, the pattern of diaphragm motion during mechanical inflation was nearly uniform. By contrast, in the prone position, the motion was nonuniform, with most motion occurring in the dorsal (nondependent) regions. It is concluded that the dominant influence on diaphragm motion may be some anatomical difference between the crural and costal diaphragm regions rather than the abdominal hydrostatic pressure gradient.\r"

Brachial artery blood flow was measured at two different times, before anesthesia and during anesthesia but before surgery, using a pulsed Doppler flowmeter. AVF flows were calculated from brachial, radial, and ulnar blood flows at the end of surgery, 2 h after surgery, and 3 and 10 days after the procedure. Mean arterial pressure was lower in patients receiving isoflurane or halothane than in those receiving local anesthesia or brachial plexus blockade (BPB). There was a significant increase in brachial artery blood flow following BPB (43.7 +/- 18.7 to 186.9 +/- 98.2 ml.min-1) during isoflurane anesthesia (46.2 +/- 15.9 to 153.1 +/- 80.5 ml.min-1) and during halothane anesthesia (49.9 +/- 24.1 to 97.6 +/- 62.1 ml.min-1). During anesthesia, the difference in brachial artery blood flow between patients in the BPB and halothane groups was significant. Local anesthesia failed to increase brachial artery blood flow (44.0 +/- 12.7 to 45.6 +/- 11.3 ml.min-1). In the immediate postoperative period, the AVF blood flow was lower in patients in the halothane group than in the other groups, but this difference was only significant when compared with BPB group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The integrated electromyogram of the adductor pollicis muscle was monitored using a cumulative dose-response technique; train-of-four stimuli were administered at 0.05 Hz. The measured ED95 values for pancuronium and gallamine were 0.069 and 2.38 mg/kg, respectively. In three separate groups, pancuronium 0.07 mg/kg, gallamine 2.4 mg/kg, or d-tubocurarine 0.45 mg/kg were given as a single bolus and the speed of onset and time to maximum effect determined. Peak twitch depression was essentially identical in all groups (92.7 +/- 1.4 [SE] vs. 93.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 93.7 +/- 1.1%, respectively). The rate of onset of neuromuscular blockade in these three groups was, however, quite different. After administration of pancuronium (n = 10) the times to 5%, 20%, 50%, and 80% twitch depression were 68 +/- 5, 97 +/- 6, 141 +/- 8, and 222 +/- 18 s. The comparable times following gallamine (n = 10) were 29 +/- 2, 42 +/- 3, 66 +/- 5, and 136 +/- 14 s; d-tubocurarine (n = 10) was intermediate in speed with onset times of 40 +/- 4, 63 +/- 6, 99 +/- 11, and 178 +/- 25 s. It appears that the onset times of different nondepolarizing blocking agents (even when given in equipotent doses) may vary by clinically appreciable amounts. The results of this study support the hypothesis that nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents of low potency may have a more rapid onset of action than that seen with agents of high potency.\r"

A single breath test and a volume recruitment maneuver for measuring Crs were applied to 18 infants and children breathing spontaneously during halothane anesthesia in order to determine the usefulness and reliability of these noninvasive tests for measuring static compliance during anesthesia. Crs from the single breath test (Crssb) was determined from the mask pressure plateau (P) during a brief end-inspiratory airway occlusion and the lung volume (V) from the passive expiration following release of the occlusion. Crs from the volume recruitment maneuver (Crsvr) was determined from P and V during a series of expiratory occlusions at progressively higher lung volumes. The P-V curves fit a polynomial curve with the convexity toward the pressure axis in most patients, and Crsvr was the tangent to the curve in the mid-tidal range. The tallest four patients did not show respiratory muscle relaxation during the occlusions with either test, and the single breath test could not be completed in an additional two patients. In the 12 patients (59-89 cm in height) in whom both tests were successful, Crssb correlated with, and was similar to, Crsvr. The intrasubject coefficient of variation was less with the single breath test (9.4 +/- 6.7%) than with the volume recruitment maneuver (15.0 +/- 7.1%). The authors conclude that both tests are simple, reliable, and rapid and give similar results for Crs in spontaneously breathing children (59-89 cm in height) anesthetized with halothane.\r"

Serum fentanyl concentrations reached a plateau approximately 14 h after placement of the transdermal fentanyl delivery system. This plateau was maintained until removal of the system at 24 h. The decline in serum fentanyl concentrations after removal of the transdermal system had a terminal half-life of 17.0 +/- 2.3 h (mean +/- SD), considerably longer than the terminal elimination half-life seen after intravenous administration of fentanyl in the same patients (6.1 +/- 2.0 h). The rate of fentanyl absorption, predicted to be 100 micrograms/h from in vitro data, appeared to be relatively constant during a period starting 4-8 h after placement of the transdermal system until removal of the system at 24 h. The rate of absorption during this period was 91.7 +/- 25.7 micrograms/h. After removal of the transdermal fentanyl delivery system, absorption continued at a declining rate. This indicates that the long terminal half-life of serum fentanyl concentrations after transdermal system removal is due to continued slow absorption of fentanyl, probably from a cutaneous depot of drug at the site of prior transdermal system placement. At the time of removal of the transdermal fentanyl system, 1.07 +/- 0.43 mg of drug remained in this depot. Systemic fentanyl bioavailability was found to be 0.92 +/- 0.33, with no evidence of significant cutaneous metabolism or degradation by the skin's bacterial flora. The transdermal administration of fentanyl produces relatively constant serum fentanyl concentrations for significant periods of time in the postsurgical patient requiring analgesic therapy.\r"

Before CPB in the first 12 patients, the radial systolic arterial pressure (SAP) was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than the ascending aortic SAP, and wrist compression did not significantly affect that difference (P greater than 0.05). After CPB, the radial artery and aortic SAPs were not statistically different (P greater than 0.05), but wrist compression restored the higher radial artery SAP. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was equal in four patients and 1-3 mmHg higher or lower in eight patients before CPB, and wrist compression did not alter those relationships. After CPB, MAP was equal in four patients; radial MAP was 1-3 mmHg higher or lower in six patients, and 7 and 10 mmHg lower in the last two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study aimed to provide pharmacokinetic data that are limited in these age groups, and to identify any adverse effects of intercostal nerve block in infancy. Arterial blood samples were taken at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 360 min. Whole blood bupivacaine was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Peak blood concentrations were attained within 10 min in 18 of 22 subjects, and were 087 micrograms.ml-1 [corrected] +/- 0.56 micrograms.ml-1 (mean and SD) and 0.91 +/- 0.27 micrograms.ml-1 in neonates and infants, respectively. Pharmacokinetic variables in the two groups included elimination half-life (t1/2 beta): 132 +/- 59 min and 102 +/- 39 min; steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss): 2.56 +/- 0.76 l.kg-1 and 2.17 +/- 0.17 l.kg-1; and total body clearance (Clt): 16.93 +/- 9.32 ml.min-1.kg-1 and 15.71 +/- 6.99 ml.min-1.kg-1. There was no statistically significant difference between neonates and infants with regard to any of these parameters. Patients were further divided into those with acyanotic and cyanotic disease.

The amount of halothane-induced calcium release was suppressed if myocytes were pretreated with caffeine. Both halothane and caffeine were found to have similar effects on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The effect of 4 mM halothane (equivalent to 13.6% v/v) was approximately equivalent to that of 10 mM caffeine. Caffeine, halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane all decreased the total calcium content of myocytes by 10-70%. These data suggest that volatile anesthetics decrease the calcium content of the cardiac SR by increasing the calcium permeability of the SR, and that the mechanism of action of volatile anesthetics may be similar to certain actions of caffeine.\r"

Meperidine was detected both in the plasma (arterial catheter) and in the ventricular CSF (intracranial catheter) soon after intrathecal administration: 45 +/- 17 min and 100 +/- 14 min, respectively. The maximal plasma concentration was 341 +/- 133 ng.ml-1, whereas, in ventricular CSF, it was 64.5 +/- 14.9 ng.ml-1. The ventricular CSF-plasma ratio increased with time (r = 0.82) from 0.18 +/- 0.04 at the first hour to 0.38 +/- 0.1 at 16th hour. It is concluded that the putative risk of respiratory depression appears to be mainly related to the absorption into the systemic circulation and to redistribution back into CSF.\r"

In this study male, Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 140) of similar weights underwent a graded lumbar spinal cord injury by inflation of an epidural balloon, to determine the effect of anesthesia upon the severity of injury. One of three different anesthetic regimens (halothane, fentanyl/nitrous oxide, or spinal lidocaine) were administered during the time of injury, and the neurologic outcome was compared to an awake control group. Physiologic variables (pH, PaCO2, PaO2, hematocrit, mean arterial pressure, serum glucose, and temperature) were maintained within normal ranges. Dose-response curves were constructed evaluating the relationship between the duration of balloon inflation versus the percentage of animals with a sustained neurologic deficit. The dose-response curves were analyzed for differences by use of a group t test. The incidence of clinical spinal cord injury (hindlimb paralysis) was lower in all three anesthetic groups as compared to awake controls (P less than 0.05). The balloon inflation time required to produce a sustained neurologic deficit in 50% of rats for each group was (minutes [mean +/- SD]): 1) awake--10.0 +/- 2.3; 2) spinal lidocaine-19.6 +/- 11.6, 3) halothane--19.8 +/- 6.7; and 4) fentanyl/nitrous oxide--37.9 +/- 18.7. This observation demonstrates that, in this model of spinal cord injury, various anesthetics improve neurologic function as compared to the awake state. It does not indicate any one technique as being either more favorable or deleterious in determining the final neurologic outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, the authors determined whether chronic conditioning would produce the opposite effect and increase the sensitivity of skeletal muscle to MTC. Five dogs were exercised by daily running over a period of 5 weeks. At the conclusion of this training period, a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of the MTC dose-response relationship was performed. The same analysis was performed on four dogs housed in the same kennel who did not undergo conditioning. Neuromuscular blockade was measured and recorded bilaterally in both gastrocnemius muscles while the animal was anesthetized with nitrous oxide and pentobarbital, 30 ml.kg-1. Plasma concentrations of MTC were measured by radioimmunoassay. The MTC concentration estimated in the effect compartment which produced 50% paralysis was 0.114 +/- 0.008 micrograms.ml-1 (mean +/- SD) in exercised dogs and 0.189 +/- 0.038 micrograms.ml-1 in nonexercised dogs, which was significant at P less than 0.005).

Blood flow was determined by injection of radioactive microspheres during the following experimental conditions: Injection 1: 1 h after 1.0% inspired isoflurane; injection 2: 25 min after hypotension (MAP 50 mmHg) was induced by isoflurane; injection 3: 10-15 min after superimposed hemorrhagic hypotension to a MAP of 30 mmHg; injection 4: 25 min after restoring MAP to 50 mmHg by one of three techniques: decreasing inspired isoflurane concentration (group 1); restoration of blood volume (group 2); and phenylephrine infusion (group 3). Normocapnia was maintained throughout (35.8-38.4 mmHg).

A significant group X time interaction was seen for infratentorial structures (P = 0.002 for cerebellum and P = 0.035 for brain stem). When MAP was increased by decreasing the inspired isoflurane concentration significantly lower rCBF to infratentorial structures was seen compared with that following the other two techniques. A significant group X time interaction was seen for cardiac output following hemorrhage (P = 0.052) being significantly higher with blood volume expansion versus phenylephrine infusion. A group X time interaction was not seen for renal blood flow (P = 0.0306).\r"

The anesthesiologist interacts with the workstation through a Macintosh computer, which is easy for the clinician to understand and to use. Seventeen sensors and monitors transmit information from the anesthesia delivery system to the computer. The computer monitors this information using a set of rules, evaluated once each breath, to detect changes in the delivery system. If an event is detected, the computer alerts the anesthesiologist with a diagram, a text message, and an audible warning. A laboratory test of the monitoring system was performed to see if it properly identified 26 different critical events during simulated low flow and closed circuit anesthesia. Five hundred and eight-three of 660 simulated critical events (88%) were identified with the unique and correct message. On 35 occasions, multiple messages were displayed, including the correct one. Critical events were misidentified or not detected 42 times. Eight false positive alarms occurred during the 20 h of testing; all occurred as a result of baseline drift in a single transducer. These results demonstrate that a sophisticated monitoring system can reliably diagnose specific anesthesia machine failures.\r"

There were no significant differences in performance between methods, except for inadequate ventilation with the Laerdal Pocket Mask (P less than .05) from poor mask fit. The correlation between years of prehospital experience and the number of resuscitations versus ventilation performance was poor. Single rescuer, EMT-Ps can successfully ventilate an infant mannequin with various size resuscitation bags. The Laerdal Pocket Mask is an ineffective device for infant mannequin ventilation and should not be recommended for infant resuscitation.\r"

Complication data were retrospectively collected from a ten-year period for 297 consecutive CO-poisoned emergency department patients who received HBOT. HBOT was indicated for 41% of the patients because of an elevated carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level alone. Central nervous system dysfunction, including loss of consciousness, and/or cardiovascular dysfunction, was the criteria for HBOT in 59% of patients, regardless of their COHb level. The mean peak COHb level was 38 mg%, with 88% of patients having a peak COHb level greater than 25 mg%. The mortality rate was 6% in this case series. Cardiac arrest occurred in 8% of patients; all experienced their first arrest prior to HBOT. The 3% of patients who sustained an isolated respiratory arrest and those who had a myocardial infarction did so prior to HBOT. Several complications, however, occurred for the first time or as a recurrent event during HBOT. These included emesis (6%), seizures (5%), agitation requiring restraints or sedation (2%), cardiac dysrhythmias or arrests (2%), and arterial hypotension (2%). No patient's level of consciousness deteriorated subsequent to the initial resuscitation except for those who later had a generalized seizure. The most significant complication attributable to HBOT was tension pneumothorax, noted in three patients (1%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fentanyl citrate is a synthetic narcotic 1,000 times as potent as meperidine. It produces minimal hemodynamic effects and is characterized by a rapid onset of sedation and analgesia, a relatively short duration of action (approximately 30 to 40 minutes), and rapid reversal with opiate antagonists. These properties make fentanyl an ideal drug for emergency department use. The safety of fentanyl use in an adult ED population has not previously been studied. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 841 patients who received fentanyl at the University of Cincinnati Center for Emergency Care between January 1985 and June 1988. The study population included 497 (59%) men and 344 (41%) women, with an average age of 33 years. The average dose of fentanyl was 180 micrograms (range, 25 to 1,400 micrograms). Six patients (1%) experienced mild side effects including nausea (one), emesis (two), urticaria (one), and pruritis (two). Nine patients (1%) developed more serious complications including six cases (0.7%) of respiratory depression and three cases (0.4%) of hypotension. Two of 183 patients (1%) who received midazolam and two of nine patients (22%) who received haloperidol developed respiratory depression. Four of the six patients with respiratory depression and two of the three patients with hypotension were intoxicated. All of the complications were transient, and none resulted in hospitalization. We conclude that fentanyl is a safe drug for use in the ED. To maximize safety, we recommend careful dosing and titration, close patient monitoring, and the availability of naloxone hydrochloride and resuscitation equipment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Observations in this latter group were of the use of needles, 22; physical examination, 18; patient handling, 17; endotracheal intubation, eight; and Foley catheter placement, three. For noncritical patients, only 52.5% of providers wore gloves for phlebotomy or IV catheter placement. For critical patients, gloves were worn by health care workers as follows: needle use, 64%; physical examination, 72%; intubation, 88%; physical handling of patients, 76%; and Foley catheter placement, 100%. Gowns, masks, and protective eyewear were used in encounters with critical patients by 28%, 1%, and 18% of workers, respectively. We conclude that there currently is a low rate of compliance with universal precaution policies by ED personnel.\r"

  ".W": "Previous authors have classified poisonous snake bites as being legitimate or illegitimate, depending on whether the victim was taking unnecessary risks with a snake before being bitten. We reviewed medical records of 86 consecutive rattlesnake bite victims cared for at a single medical center to determine legitimacy of snake bites. A bite was considered illegitimate if, before being bitten, the victim recognized an encounter with a snake but did not attempt to move away from the snake. A legitimate bite was said to have occurred if a person was bitten before an encounter with a snake was recognized or was bitten while attempting to move away from a snake. The study group was made up of 75 male (87.2%) and 11 female (12.8%) victims. Seventy-four percent were 18 to 50 years old, and 15% had been bitten previously. Only 43.4% of all bites were considered legitimate, and pet (captive) snakes accounted for almost one third of all illegitimate bites. The ingestion of alcoholic beverages was associated with 56.5% of illegitimate bites versus 16.7% of legitimate bites (P less than .001). While 74.4% of bites were to upper extremities, only 27% of upper extremity bites were legitimate. All bites to the lower extremity were legitimate (P less than .001). Of 14 individuals bitten by pet snakes, all were men and 64.3% were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the bite.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We initiated a prospective study of the dizzy patient to identify key factors on which a directed evaluation could be based. This study used a standardized history, physical examination, and basic laboratory evaluation totalling 66 items to assist collection of relevant clinical information on 125 patients. Diagnosis was based on the emergency physicians' diagnosis. This was modified when necessary based on one month of follow-up using diagnostic criteria adapted from previous studies. The most common disorder was some form of peripheral vestibular disorder, found in 54 patients (43%). These patients were typically vertiginous and were managed successfully as outpatients. Despite correlations with multiple factors, this diagnosis was best predicted by positive Nylen-Barany test with either vertigo, vomiting, or both with 94% specificity and 43% sensitivity. Potentially serious causes were identified, including medication-related, seizure, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, vertebral-basilar insufficiency, hypertension, pericarditis, arrhythmias, and all those requiring hospitalization. The best predictors, either older age, lack of vertigo, or neurologic deficit, could identify 86% of \"serious\" dizziness with 42% specificity. The following tests were of low yield and may be done in a directed manner based on a brief history: Valsalva, carotid stimulation, Romberg and Quix tests, mental status examination, complete blood count, serum electrolytes, and BUN. Our results do support routine testing of glucose in all patients and monitoring rhythm in patients age 45 and older. Such a directed approach could rapidly classify a significant number of dizzy patients and forego many time- and cost-intensive elements of provocative examination and laboratory testing.\r"

A computed tomography scan of the head was normal, as were plain films of the mastoids. Lumbar puncture revealed a markedly elevated opening pressure with an otherwise normal cerebrospinal fluid examination, and she was given the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri. Despite treatment with acetazolamide, prednisone, and repeated lumbar punctures, her symptoms worsened. A magnetic resonance imaging study revealed thrombosis of the right sigmoid sinus, and repeat computed tomography showed evidence of mastoiditis. Definitive therapy consisted of a right mastoidectomy and antimicrobial therapy, to which the patient responded promptly. This case illustrates an unusual sequela of otitis media--termed otitic hydrocephalus--that resulted from obstruction of the sigmoid sinus. Although otitis media is generally a benign illness, clinicians must be alert to suppurative complications, which may evolve insidiously.\r"

Respiratory work to overcome upper airway obstruction from a number of pathologic conditions may be reduced by inhaling He-O2 instead of room air. We present the case of a 23-year-old woman with a history of asthma and tracheal angioedema refractory to conventional antiasthma and even immunosuppressive therapy. She had previously required frequent intubation and mechanical ventilatory support. During the most recent episode of respiratory distress, prior to intubation as access for mechanical ventilatory support, the patient was placed on He-O2 by a nonrebreathing face mask. She improved clinically within minutes, and continuous pulse oximetry showed a rise in oxygen saturation from 91% to 98%. The patient's condition stabilized and intubation was not required during the subsequent hospitalization. He-O2 may be beneficial in certain patients with acute upper airway obstruction as a noninvasive, temporizing therapy with minimal adverse effects. We recommend close monitoring of the clinical response and the use of continuous pulse oximetry, substantiated by arterial blood gases when feasible.\r"

Respondents were asked to use a scale of 1 to 5 (with 1 being highest) to rate the adequacy of their residency training relative to 20 major core content areas. A 50% response rate (N = 151) was achieved. Mean ratings of residents' perceptions of the adequacy of their training relative to the core content ranged from 1.7 to 3.24. Training in resuscitation and stabilization, principles of emergency care, and general assessment were among the most highly rated, while training in physician interpersonal skills, disorders related to the immune system, and cutaneous disorders were rated the lowest. Overall, residents were quite positive in their perceptions regarding the quality of their training. They indicated plans to attend continuing medical education programs to reinforce some of their training and to address some of the deficiencies they perceived in residency training. Programs are encouraged to conduct similar surveys with their own graduates to assess particular strengths and weaknesses.\r"

The results were compared to previous surveys in 1978, 1980, and 1984 to determine the impact of policies recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, state health departments, and other agencies. A high degree of uniformity again was demonstrated in chemoprophylaxis and hospitalization policies. However, screening, drug toxicity monitoring, and post-treatment follow-up varied widely among programs. A major trend toward short-course chemotherapy (mean duration of treatment, 20.8 +/- 2.34 months in 1980 versus 7.59 +/- 1.02 months in 1988) accompanied inclusion of pyrazinamide in first-line treatment of 59.4% of all patients in 1988 versus none in 1980. The prevalence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in association with tuberculosis was estimated to be 7.72% in 1988 versus 2.52% in 1984; nine programs identified AIDS + tuberculosis in greater than 5% of all new cases in 1988 versus only two programs in 1984. Health departments identified the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and their respective state health departments as the major source of treatment policy; recommendations of the World Health Organization, American Academy of Pediatrics, and peer-reviewed literature had little effect upon treatment policies. This survey identifies substantial departures from prior treatment policies, some of which are attributed to reduction in available funding, development of shorter-course technology, and recognition of new groups of patients at risk to develop tuberculosis in the major cities in the major cities in the United States.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Full exploration of its antineoplastic effects has been limited by side effects. We have previously shown that the administration of TNF to guinea pigs is associated with a syndrome similar to gram-negative septic shock, which includes capillary permeability lung injury. In this study, we measured the effects of pentoxifylline (PTX) on parameters of TNF-induced lung injury including: lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, the ratio of lung-to-plasma 125I-labeled albumin (albumin index), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral leukocyte counts, and serial measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP). Four groups of animals were studied: a TNF group received 3.75 x 10(6) U/kg TNF; a PTX group received a 20-mg/kg bolus of PTX followed by an infusion of 6 mg/kg/h; the PTX-TNF group received both; and the final group was a saline control. ANOVA analysis revealed significant elevations of lung wet-to-dry ratio only in the TNF group (5.9 [5.6 to 6.3], p less than 0.001), expressed as the mean followed by 95% confidence intervals). Lung albumin index was elevated only in the TNF group (0.24 [0.19 to 0.29], p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In both groups, the total cell counts in BAL were similar, irrespective of whether they were challenged with antigen or diluent. However, in the late-phase responders (LPR), there were significant increases in lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils (p less than 0.05), and significant decreases in the percentage of lung mast cells (p less than 0.05). The eosinophil major basic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin increased in four of five subjects with dual responses and in the majority of single early responders (SER). BAL histamine concentrations increased in five of seven patients with dual responses. There were no consistent changes in LTB4 concentrations in either the LPR or the SER between diluent and antigen days, but a small but significant increase in LTC4 was observed in the LPR. Concentrations of IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, C3, and albumin did not differ significantly. The percentage of monocyte complement rosettes also increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in LPR, but not in SER. These findings support the hypothesis that eosinophils and their products play a role in tissue injury in LPR and that eosinophil infiltration may be associated with macrophage activation.\r"

Nine subjects received 18 capsules of Max-EPA (3.2 g eicosapentaenoic acid and 2.2 g docosahexaenoic acid) a day and eight subjects received identical capsules containing olive oil, for 10 wk in a double-blind fashion. There were no differences between prediet values and those observed after dietary supplementation with Max-EPA or placebo in the dose of allergen causing an acute asthmatic response as assessed by a 35% fall in specific airways conductance (PD35), the extinction dose of allergen on skin prick testing, the histamine PD35, or the total serum IgE concentrations. Twelve of the 17 subjects developed late asthmatic responses after allergen challenge prediet. Six of these subjects received Max-EPA, and six received placebo capsules. As compared to prediet values, the magnitude of the allergen-induced late asthmatic response was significantly attenuated from 2 to 7 h after allergen challenge following dietary supplementation with Max-EPA (p less than 0.005) but not with placebo. The attenuation of the late response was not accompanied by any significant change in the clinical severity of disease as assessed by diurnal peak expiratory flow rates, symptom scores, or bronchodilator drug usage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although peripheral blood eosinophils (EOS) of low density are increased in patients with asthma, the mechanisms contributing to their presence are not well established. The following study evaluated the effect of an antigen bronchoprovocation (BP) on the percentage of circulating hypodense eosinophils (HE) in asthma. EOS density was measured by centrifugation of peripheral blood granulocytes over multiple discontinuous density Percoll gradients in samples taken immediately before and 24 h after antigen BP. We found that the percentage of peripheral blood HE (density less than 1.095 g/ml) increased significantly (p less than 0.02) over baseline values (78.9 +/- 4.8% versus 53.3 +/- 8.2%, mean +/- SEM, n = 11) when evaluated 24 h after antigen BP but only in patients who experienced both an immediate (IAR) and late phase asthma reaction (LAR). No significant change in the percentage of HE was observed in asthma subjects who had only an early asthma response to inhaled antigen (n = 6). In an expanded population of allergic asthmatics (n = 38), a significant correlation was found between the percent peripheral blood HE and disease severity as represented by the percent predicted FEV1 (r = -0.56, p = 0.003). These data suggest that in vivo activation of asthma by inhaled antigen increases the proportion of peripheral blood EOS that are hypodense but only in those patients with both an IAR and LAR. Furthermore, we also conclude that the percentage of HE better reflects the severity of asthma than the concentration of total peripheral blood eosinophils.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The frequency spectrum of segments of the sound signal was determined using the fast fourier transform technique. The sound signal associated with stridor had a similar frequency to that found with asthma. However, the signal was more intense over the neck than over the chest, whereas in asthmatics the reverse was true. The musical sounds in patients with stridor occurred during inspiration, whereas in those patients with asthma, they were predominantly expiratory. The major difference between stridor and asthma was the timing of the sound and the prominence of the sound over the neck.\r"

Control subjects did not fatigue with these resistances. In ALS patients, theophylline increased respiratory muscle strength after resistive breathing as manifested by an increase in negative inspiratory pressure (28.2%), vital capacity (10%), and peak inspiratory flow rate (11.8%). It is concluded that in patients with ALS, the already weakened respiratory muscles are easily fatigued. Furthermore, theophylline can strengthen loaded respiratory muscles in patients with ALS.\r"

Smokers were included, but all subjects had normal FEV1 and FVC. The objective of the study was to compare measured values of VO2max and Wmax in this older population with previously published predicted values based on subjects of all ages. We found that Wmax observed exceeded Wmax predicted by 9.5 +/- 22% (mean +/- SD) and that VO2max observed exceeded VO2max predicted by 17.5 +/- 22%. Because of this systematic underestimate of VO2max and Wmax by the previous prediction equations, we constructed new prediction equations for use in subjects older than 55 yr of age using height, weight, age, and sex as variables. We conclude that these new prediction equations more accurately predict Wmax and VO2max in subjects older than 55 yr of age because they are based solely on subjects in this age group.\r"

To determine the influence of psychological status on respiratory symptoms, we compared subjects' ATS-Q responses to their Ilfeld Psychiatric Symptom Index (PSI) scores. To minimize the potential confounding effect of respiratory disease on the association between respiratory and psychological status, from a population-based survey of 3,628 subjects, we studied only the 600 \"healthy\" subjects, defined by the following characteristics: between 14 and 55 yr of age; never-smokers; no diagnoses of respiratory, heart, kidney, thyroid disease, or anemia; and normal spirometry (defined as an FEV1 and FVC greater than 80% of predicted). Associations were found between respiratory symptoms (cough, phlegm, wheeze, dyspnea) and PSI subscales (anxiety, anger, depression, and cognitive disturbance). Adjusted odds ratios for respiratory symptoms ranged from 1.13 to 2.15 for every 10% increase in PSI score. Psychological status is an important determinant of respiratory symptoms and therefore must be taken into consideration when interpreting results of epidemiologic studies using questionnaire information.\r"

  ".W": "A conjugate between glucose oxidase (GO) and monoclonal antibody to human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cross-reacting with rat ACE (MoAb9b9) has been prepared by oxidation of the cardohydrate moiety of the enzyme with sodium periodate. The conjugate (GO-MoAb9b9) thus obtained retained both antigen-binding capacity and enzymatic activity. The fate of the conjugate in vivo after intravenous injection was studied using conjugates containing radiolabeled enzyme. GO-MoAb9b9 was specifically accumulated in rat lungs upon in vivo administration, as compared with free enzyme and nonimmune IgG-conjugated glucose oxidase. The specificity of the conjugate accumulation expressed as the localization ratio (the ratio between radioactivity of gram tissue to that of blood) (Loc. Ratio) reached a value up to 50 on the second day after injection, in contrast to native enzyme and to IgG-conjugated enzyme (Loc. Ratio was less than 0.5 for both preparations). The Loc. Ratio of GO-MoAb9b9 was even higher than that of the original antibody MoAb9b9 and was equal to 20, which is probably explained by an extremely rapid blood clearance of the conjugate from the circulation. The administration of excess free MoAb9b9 dramatically inhibited the conjugate targeting in the lung without any effect on liver uptake. At doses ranging from 10 to 1,000 micrograms/rat, the conjugate was accumulated in the lung without saturation of the antigen determinants of the target. At minimal doses, the efficiency of targeting achieved 5 to 7% of the conjugate injected. With elevation of the dose, the efficiency of targeting decreased to 2.5% of the injected dose (1 mg of GO-MoAb9b9 per rat). A sixfold greater accumulation of unmodified radiolabeled MoAb9b9 compared with the GO-MoAb9b9 conjugate in rat lung has been observed, though the kinetics of desorption from the target organ was similar for both the antibody and the conjugate. In the bloodstream, the conjugate persisted for at least 5 days without binding to blood cells; all circulating radioactivity was associated with proteins. A considerable part of the conjugate (to 50%) circulated as a tight antibody-enzyme complex for several days. The conjugate retained its antigen-binding capacity for at least 24 h; during this period, its enzymatic activity decreased by less than 40%. The results obtained provide the experimental ground for further attempts to apply glucose oxidase conjugates for local modulation of inflammation and elimination of the target cells.\r"

We have compared the urinary neopterin/creatinine ratio (mumol/mol) in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis (n = 66), interstitial lung diseases other than sarcoidosis (nonsarcoid ILD, n = 35), and 45 normal control subjects. For the sarcoid population as a whole, urinary neopterin was higher (496 +/- 52 mumol/mol [mean +/- SEM]) than in control subjects (126 +/- 5 mumol/mol) (p less than 0.001). In patients with nonsarcoid ILD, urinary neopterin was frequently higher in granulomatous and/or lymphoproliferative diseases (hypersensitivity pneumonitis, tuberculosis, primitive Sjogren's syndrome, and malignant lymphomas) (781 +/- 193 mumol/mol, n = 10) but remained normal in other types of nonsarcoid ILD [( 163 +/- 14 mumol/mol, n = 25]: histiocytosis X, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lung collagen-vascular diseases, diffuse neoplasms, pneumoconiosis; p less than 0.001 compared with sarcoidosis). We have also evaluated the relationship between urinary neopterin and the clinical or biologic markers currently used to assess sarcoidosis: alveolar lymphocytosis in lavage fluid (ALY), 67-gallium scan semiquantitative index (67Ga), or serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE). Sarcoid patients with the highest urinary neopterin were those in whom mean values of these markers were the highest (p less than 0.05, all comparisons). Patients with positive markers (i.e., either clinical expression of sarcoidosis-ALY greater than 30%-67Ga greater than 20-SACE greater than 60 U/ml) had significantly higher urinary neopterin levels than did other sarcoid patients (p less than 0.05, all comparisons).\r"

By using a measure of cellular immune response to beryllium salts, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lung biopsy, we have identified 12 new cases of beryllium disease. Each of these individuals had pathologic changes on biopsy, lymphocytic alveolitis on BAL, and positive BAL lymphocyte transformation tests (LTT) in response to beryllium sulfate. This group of patients was remarkable for its paucity of clinical findings. At initial evaluation, seven had no respiratory symptoms, and four had normal physical examinations. Five had no increase in interstitial markings on chest radiograph. In eight cases, flow rates and lung volumes were normal. Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was low in only one case, and oxygen exchange during exercise was normal in six of nine subjects studied. In addition to the 12 cases, we evaluated eight beryllium-exposed workers who had other (nonberyllium) lung diseases; two of these eight demonstrated beryllium sensitization based on BAL LTT. We conclude that use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy and BAL facilitates diagnosis of beryllium workers who have histopathologic and immunologic alterations consistent with chronic beryllium disease. These findings may precede frank clinical illness and physiologic impairment, having important implications for our understanding of the natural history of beryllium disease.\r"

Indices of lower respiratory tract abnormalities detected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were investigated in 93 asbestos-exposed workers as well as in smoking (n = 12) and nonsmoking (n = 10) control subjects. Patients with clinical asbestosis (n = 12) exhibited increases in both BAL neutrophils and BAL eosinophils, expressed as both percentage of total cells and total numbers, when compared to asbestos-exposed workers without asbestosis (n = 81) and control subjects. Significantly greater numbers of BAL neutrophils were also found in asbestos-exposed workers without asbestosis than in either smoking or nonsmoking control subjects. These abnormalities correlated significantly with in vitro BAL alveolar macrophage production of the potent leukocyte chemotaxin, leukotriene B4 (LTB4). For example, basal, unstimulated LTB4 production was 3.1 +/- 0.8 ng/10(6) alveolar macrophages for patients with asbestosis, 1.05 +/- 0.2 ng/10(6) cells in asbestos workers without asbestosis, 0.9 +/- 0.2 ng/10(6) cells in control nonsmokers, and 0.2 +/- 0.05 ng/10(6) cells in control smokers. Stimulated LTB4 release from BAL alveolar macrophages (A23187 or arachidonate) was even more pronounced in asbestos workers with or without asbestosis, suggesting an in vivo priming effect on alveolar macrophage synthesis of LTB4. Cell-free BAL supernatants from asbestos-exposed patients with or without asbestosis also contained significantly greater amounts of LTB4 than did those from control subjects, indicating enhanced in vivo production of this inflammatory mediator.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The HRCT was normal or near normal in 76 subjects (Group 1), abnormal but indeterminate for asbestosis in 36, and abnormal and suggestive of asbestosis in 57 (Group 2). The indeterminate subjects were excluded from further analysis. The subjects in Groups 1 and 2 were not significantly different in their duration of asbestos exposure, latency, smoking history, or in measurements of airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC% and %FEV1). Both the vital capacity percent predicted and diffusing capacity percent predicted were significantly lower in the abnormal subjects (Group 2) than in the normal subjects (Group 1) (79.0 versus 86.2, p = 0.005; 78.2 versus 87.1, p = 0.024; independent t test). We conclude that in asbestos-exposed subjects with normal chest radiographs, HRCT can identify a group of subjects with significantly reduced lung function indicative of restrictive lung disease when compared with a group with normal or near-normal HRCT.\r"

We have studied 32 patients with chronic airflow limitation (FEV1, 15 to 68% predicted) caused by chronic bronchitis and emphysema (synonym, COPD), with a wide range of arterial PO2 (38 to 90 mm Hg) and PCO2 (32 to 63 mm Hg) while breathing air at rest. We could find no significant relationships between the extent of emphysema (as assessed in vivo by the EMI number defining the lowest fifth percentile of the CT density histogram of the lung fields) and either arterial blood gas tensions, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, cardiac output, or calculated total pulmonary vascular resistance while at rest (n = 32) or during supine leg exercise (n = 29). We conclude that the extent of emphysema does not correlate with the clinical or pathologic features of the \"pink and puffing\" (i.e., mild hypoxemia, no CO2 retention, no pulmonary hypertension, etc.) or \"blue and bloated\" (i.e., hypoxemia, CO2 retention, pulmonary hypertension) pattern of patients with COPD nor to the spectrum of hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities that commonly occur in patients between these two extreme examples. Thus, \"pink puffers\" should not be equated with \"the emphysematous\" pattern of this disease. Although these clinicophysiologic patterns remain valid as descriptions, they do not relate to the extent of underlying emphysema in COPD.\r"

We hypothesized that, in the setting of rapid growth, a hypoxic stimulus would cause greater pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). We have studied the relationship between artial oxygenation (SaO2), RVH, and pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) in 28 awake VFG chickens. We found that the hypoxemic chickens had pulmonary hypertension and that the Ppa was linearly related to the SaO2. The relationship between Ppa and RVH, however, was best described by a broken line (p less than 0.05). Thus, at higher pressures, the RVH seemed excessive for a given Ppa. We have also studied the effects of reducing FIO2 on Ppa, systemic pressure, cardiac output, and calculated total pulmonary resistance (TPR) in lightly anesthetized fast-growing and normal chickens. We found that normal chickens and fast growers had similar TPR in room air, but that the fast growers had a greater increase in TPR than did the normal chickens in response to hypoxia (p less than 0.05). Finally, we placed 2-wk-old normal and VFG chicks in a hypobaric chamber set at \"10,000 feet\" for 2 wk and found that the VFG but not the normal chickens developed marked RVH in response to the hypoxia. However, the RVH in the fast-growing chickens could be prevented by restricting their diet, and hence their growth. We conclude that hypoxemia probably caused the pulmonary hypertension and RVH in the fast-growing chickens, but that the rapid growth appeared to act as an important amplifier of this response.\r"

  ".W": "We have used a probe against the adenovirus genome to study cultured epithelial cells specifically infected with various types of adenovirus and Graham 293 cells, which contain few copy numbers of a fraction of the adenovirus genome. We have also examined lung tissue obtained from three cases of acute adenovirus pneumonia, two cases of adenovirus pneumonia that had passed through the acute phase, and nine cases of follicular bronchiectasis. Our purpose was to determine whether the probe was effective in detecting a wide variety of adenovirus types, to determine whether it could detect adenovirus in lung tissue that had been fixed and stored in paraffin blocks for several years, and to test the hypothesis that adenovirus was an important cause of follicular bronchiectasis. The results show that the probe was able to detect adenovirus from Genera B1, B2, C, D, and E with a sensitivity of 5 to 10 copies/cell. The probe also detected adenovirus in 14 of 14 slides from three cases of acute disease, but failed to obtain a positive result in the cases examined after an acute infection or in any of the cases of follicular bronchiectasis. We conclude that the in situ hybridization technique is useful in the investigation of active adenovirus infection of the lung. The failure to show that the virus persisted in the chronic respiratory disease that follows adenovirus infection, or that it was present in cases of follicular bronchiectasis could be due to either a true absence, or to its presence in a latent form that is below the level of sensitivity of this technique.\r"

Other signs of systemic involvement were also present such as peripheral neuropathy, hematuria with erythrocytic casts and proteinuria, pericardial effusion, and a dilated cardiomyopathy. The histopathologic picture was complex and unique. The early age of onset, the multisystemic involvement, and the prompt response to cyclophosphamide pointed to a diagnosis of \"polyangiitis overlap syndrome,\" with some aspects of Churg-Strauss syndrome and also temporal arteritis. Physicians should be aware of these polymorphous and life-threatening pulmonary vasculitic syndromes, which require aggressive immunosuppressor therapy.\r"

The 12 men and 8 women ranged in age from 22 to 76 years, with a mean of 52. Seven functional tumors included three insulinomas, two glucagonomas, one gastrinoma, and one somatostatinoma. One insulinoma was associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-I) syndrome. The 13 patients with nonfunctioning tumors had abdominal pain (3), jaundice (2), and steatorrhea (2). Seven had a palpable abdominal mass. Diagnosis of malignancy was based on local invasion (4), distant metastases (15), or both (1). One patient had percutaneous biopsy of a hepatic metastasis. All others had laparotomy for diagnosis and/or treatment. Each patient had a single tumor except the patient with MEN-I syndromes, who had multiple tumors throughout the pancreas. The head was involved in seven patients, the body in seven, and the tail in five. Operations included six curative and three palliative resections, five biliary diversions (two with concomitant enteric bypass), and five biopsies. Palliative resections were done for hormonal or local symptoms such as gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and pain. Multiple chemotherapeutic agents were used, but the best results were obtained with DTIC (50% response). Four patients had radiation for liver, brain, or bone metastasis, with some improvement. Of five patients who had curative resections, four are alive 15 to 144 months, with a mean of 75 months. One died six years after diagnosis. Of the remaining 15 patients who had liver metastasis, seven patients are alive 8 to 168 months later, with a mean of 87 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The importance of \"operative timing\" in cirrhotic patients with variceal hemorrhage is often underemphasized. To evaluate the effects of immediate versus delayed selective portasystemic decompression on hepatic function, operative mortality, and long-term patient survival, we reviewed the records of 77 patients who underwent distal splenorenal shunts (DSRS) over a 14-year period. A hepatic risk status score was calculated at the time of the index bleed (HRS1) or presentation and again just prior to operation (HRS2). Variables analyzed included age, sex, prior bleeding episodes, time from index bleed to operation, transfusion requirements, and etiology of cirrhosis. Operative mortality rates for immediate versus delayed DSRS were 46.2 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively. HRS improved significantly in elective DSRS patients from 1.46 to 1.30. Predictors of HRS2 included HRS1 and time in days from the index bleed to operation. The most important predictor of early survival for all patients after elective DSRS was the HRS2; however, for patients who underwent elective DSRS and survived, HRS1 was a better predictor of length of survival than HRS2. No other variable analyzed accurately predicted survival. We conclude that HRS can be expected to improve with supportive inhospital therapy; improved HRS at the time of operation is associated with decreased operative mortality; and the extent of liver disease as determined by HRS1 appears to be the chief determinant of long-term patient survival.\r"

Patients were divided into two groups. Group One patients had selective PAS lab work based on history and physical examination. Group Two patients underwent a standardized PAS consisting of history, physical examination, biochemical profile, complete blood count, and urinalysis. Patients in both groups received a prothrombin/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) if one anticoagulation therapy, an electrocardiogram (EKG) with age greater than 40 years, and a chest X ray with age greater than 50 years. We found that the frequency of surgery cancellation before and after instituting a standardized PAS remained the same (6.9% vs 6.4%); furthermore, only 38.5 per cent of the cancellations in Group One and 16.4 per cent in Group Two were due to laboratory, EKG, or chest X-ray results. The rest were due to intercurrent illness, scheduling conflicts, and other uncontrollable factors. A closer analysis of Group Two shows that of 4,058 standardized preadmission screens performed, 4,015 (99%) were normal; only 43 (1%) had abnormal results that led to cancellation of ambulatory surgery. Similarly, 99.93 per cent of all EKGs and 99.97 per cent of all chest X-rays performed in both groups were normal, having no influence on operational performance or patient management. We suggest that selective use of laboratory and diagnostic studies, in conjunction with a thorough history and physical examination, is as effective as a standardized PAS in identifying patients at risk for ambulatory surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-seven patients underwent 30 TAR and 15 underwent SCR for TOS. The operating time was similar for the two groups. Mean blood loss was 61 cc for the SCR group and 218 cc for the TAR group. There was one complication in the SCR group, a urinary tract infection, whereas the TAR group had 21 complications including pneumothorax (13), laceration of subclavian vessel (3), winged scapula (3), pleural effusion (1), and wound infection (1). Postoperative hospitalization averaged 3 and 5 days, respectively, for the SCR and TAR patients. All SCR patients and all but one TAR patient were improved or asymptomatic immediately postoperatively. Ninety-three per cent and 81 per cent, respectively, of SCR and TAR patients were improved at 2 months, whereas 100 per cent and 83 per cent, respectively, remained improved at a mean follow-up of 3 years. The significantly fewer complications, decreased blood loss and shorter postoperative hospitalization, noted in the SCR patients supports this approach as the preferred form of management for TOS.\r"

Sixty-eight patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) underwent 74 parathyroid procedures over a 10-year period. There were 38 per cent women and 62 per cent men in this population--the same proportion of men and women with ESRD. These proportions are reversed when compared with patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. The mean time between initiation of dialytic therapy and parathyroidectomy was 5.4 years. Preoperative mean serum calcium and phosphorus levels were 10.1 +/- 0.2 and 6.1 +/- 0.2 mg/dl, respectively. All patients were symptomatic and 60 per cent of the patients had at least two symptoms before surgery. Renal osteodystrophy was the most common symptom (74%), whereas pruritus was noted in 65 per cent of this population. Patients underwent either subtotal (88%) or total (12%) parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation. Six patients required reoperation: five for recurrent disease (2 to 5 years after the initial surgery) and one for persistent disease. All patients were symptomatically improved after the surgery. Complications included the following: transient hoarseness (7%), hypocalcemia requiring calcium, and/or vitamin D therapy (32%) for 6 months after surgery. This analysis demonstrates that although the initial therapy of secondary hyperparathyroidism is medical, surgical therapy should be instituted before multiple symptoms develop in the ESRD population.\r"

It is well recognized in the pediatric population as a frequent cause of persistent neonatal hypoglycemia. However, its occurrence in adults is presumed to be rare and, therefore, it is not appreciated as a cause of hyperinsulinism. Three women, aged 29, 42, and 63, with adult onset hyperinsulinism secondary to nesidioblastosis are reported. All three patients required near-total pancreatectomy. The preoperative findings were consistent with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia as with insulinomas. Results of pancreatic imaging studies were normal in two patients and one patient had a pancreatic examination by computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, with false-positive results. Two of the three patients had previously undergone a 50 per cent distal pancreatectomy in which the resected specimens were interpreted as normal in one patient and consistent with nesidioblastosis in the second. Both patients subsequently developed recurrent symptomatic hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia that persisted despite dosage adjustments in diazoxide therapy. The oldest patient underwent a 95 per cent pancreatectomy at the initial surgical exploration because an insulinoma could not be identified. The other patients underwent a completion 95 per cent pancreatectomy. In both, histochemical examination of each specimen disclosed nesidioblastosis, characterized by clusters of islet cells interspersed throughout the exocrine tissue.\r"

Thirty-two patients died during surgery or in the immediate postoperative period. In 19 of the remaining 71 patients ischemic colitis developed, an incidence of 27 per cent. This report reviews the clinical findings and course of these patients. The average age of patients developing ischemic colitis was 72 years (range, 53 to 90 years), not significantly different from the group as a whole. There was no correlation between the type of vascular reconstruction and the development of ischemic colitis. Eleven patients died and eight survived, for a mortality rate of 58 per cent. The most common clinical finding was diarrhea early in the postoperative period, which was noted in 20 patients. Thirteen of these patients had ischemic colitis confirmed by flexible sigmoidoscopy. Eight (62%) of these 13 patients survived; three were managed nonoperatively and five had colectomy. Six patients presented between postoperative days 9 and 20 with signs of increasing sepsis but with no diarrhea or other significant clinical findings; ischemic colitis was confirmed by sigmoidoscopy in all six patients. All of these patients died of septic complications. Seven patients with early postoperative diarrhea had normal sigmoidoscopic findings. None developed septic complications and five survived; two died of cardiac events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The question of what constitutes an adequate axillary dissection for breast cancer remains open for debate. Central to this controversy is whether axillary nodal metastasis occurs in a stepwise fashion or spreads sporadically, creating skip metastases. The therapeutic aim of axillary dissection also must be considered. To resolve this controversy, a prospective study involving 129 patients who underwent complete axillary dissection for breast carcinoma was performed. The tissue from the axillary dissections was divided intraoperatively and sent to the pathologist as two specimens. The first specimen contained all nodes lateral to the pectoralis minor muscle (Level I), whereas the second contained all nodes beneath and medial to the pectoralis minor (Levels II and III). The tissue was analyzed to determine the frequency of skip metastasis. Only two patients, 1.6 per cent of the total group or 3.2 per cent of the positive node group, were found to have a positive node in Level II-III with no metastasis in Level I. A thorough dissection of Level I alone is sufficient to detect more than 98 per cent of all axillary lymph node metastases from breast cancer. Thus, proper staging of the disease can be obtained. When Level I contained positive nodes, the probability of metastatic disease to higher levels was significant (45%), indicating further treatment is necessary in incomplete axillary dissections.\r"
