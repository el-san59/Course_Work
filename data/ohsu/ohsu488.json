Graft function deteriorated in six women, from obstruction of the transplanted ureter in two, recurrent glomerulonephritis in two, rejection in one, and pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in one. Hypertension worsened or developed in all but one of the pregnancies and proteinuria appeared in eight. Of the 10 live births only one reached 38 weeks gestation (mean 35 weeks) and four neonates were small for gestational age. One infant died early from intraventricular hemorrhage and hyaline membrane disease, one fetus had hydrocephalus, and the others were normal. Factors associated with a poor fetal outcome were deterioration in graft function during pregnancy, pre-existing hypertension, or the development of hypertension before the third trimester.\r"

The pathogenesis of myocarditis has been studied in animal models. Several investigators have documented the development of myocardial damage in mice after infection with a virus. Patients with myocarditis may present with highly variable clinical pictures ranging from no clinical manifestations to overt clinical congestive heart failure or sudden death. Endomyocardial biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis. There are conflicting data regarding treatment of myocarditis. Immunosuppression may be useful in reducing myocardial inflammation and preventing irreversible myocardial damage. Nurses participate in care of patients during evaluation and treatment for myocarditis. Ongoing assessment of cardiac function is imperative at all times.\r"

  ".W": "A new class of antihypertensive agents has emerged for clinical consideration in the initial treatment of hypertension. These calcium antagonists are rapidly absorbed and reduce arterial pressure very promptly by antagonizing the pathophysiologic hallmark of the disease: an increased vascular resistance. Moreover, in reducing arterial pressure by means of arteriolar dilation, these agents do so without expanding intravascular volume and without inordinately stimulating the heart through reflex mechanisms. Vascular resistance is reduced in each of the major target organs of the disease: the heart, brain, and kidney. Reduction of coronary vascular resistance should be of particular value in patients with increased myocardial oxygen demands (e.g., with coronary arterial disease or with ventricular hypertrophy). Reduction of renal vascular resistance should be especially valuable for patients with renal functional impairment as a result of hypertensive vascular disease or with associated renal parenchymal diseases. In this respect, these agents reduce renal vascular resistance while maintaining glomerular filtration rate and reducing renal filtration fraction; these changes should reduce glomerular hyperfiltration and may inhibit promotion of glomerulosclerosis. Diltiazem may be of particular value because it may produce these effects while increasing renal blood flow. Clearly these agents reverse cerebral constriction and might be expected to improve blood flow to the brain; however, further study is anticipated and necessary.\r"

Good mechanical control involves integument protection and a mechanism of drainage collection. The patient we describe taxed the ingenuity and creativity of all those concerned with his care. Modification of a previously described technique to protect surrounding skin and collect fistula output served as a simple and inexpensive approach to eliminate infection potential, improve the patient's comfort, and decrease the nursing time that would have been required for frequent, complex dressing changes.\r"

In the present study, insulin action was determined using the euglycemic clamp technique in six untrained nonobese subjects before, during, and after long-term mild regular jogging. After 1 yr of jogging, steady-state plasma insulin levels (I) decreased significantly, and the metabolic clearance rate of insulin was increased by 87%, although insulin infusion rate during the clamp was constant for each individual. The amount of glucose infused (glucose metabolism, M) tended to increase from 6.16 +/- 0.94 to 8.15 +/- 1.94 mg.kg-1.min-1 after regular jogging for 1 yr, although that was not statistically significant. However, M/I increases significantly from 0.060 +/- 0.012 to 0.184 +/- 0.056 (P less than 0.05) after 1 yr. The concentrations of plasma free fatty acids during the hyperinsulinemic clamp decreased more significantly after 1 yr of jogging (P less than 0.05). The concentrations of plasma glycerol decreased gradually before and after long-term regular jogging, showing only a 50-60% reduction in 120 min. Therefore, long-term mild regular jogging, which did not influence either body mass index or maximal O2 uptake, appears to improve insulin action in both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and to increase the metabolic clearance rate of insulin.\r"

Submicronic aerosols containing Tc-DTPA and In-DTPA were simultaneously generated by different nebulizers and collected within the same anesthetic bag. The combined aerosols were insufflated into piglets. Clearances for both compounds were measured simultaneously in normal lungs and when the lungs were damaged by intravenous oleic acid or by a presumed oxidant agent, intravenous or intratracheal phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). A medium-energy collimator and a computer-assisted gamma camera were used to calculate clearances. Correction was made for downscatter from the In photopeak into the Tc window. Marked lung injury occurred as evidenced by increases in lung water content and decreases in arterial PO2. The clearance of In-DTPA was slightly but significantly slower than for Tc-DTPA in each group of animals. The correlation (r = 0.93) between clearances for Tc-DTPA and In-DTPA was good, even though in vitro studies demonstrated that Tc-DTPA, but not In-DTPA, slowly dissociated at room and body temperatures. Oleic acid increased, but surprisingly, PMA had no effect on clearance rates for both In-DTPA and Tc-DTPA. We recommend continued use of Tc-DTPA for these measurements in view of its lower cost, requirement for only low-energy collimation, better imaging characteristics, and widespread availability. The overlap between control and injured lungs and the lack of increased clearance rates after PMA suggest this technique does not always detect acute lung injury.\r"

Development of acute tolerance was studied by injection of S. marcescens LPS (0.02 micrograms/kg iv) on 3 consecutive days: pulmonary arterial pressure and thromboxane B2 levels were significantly lower than controls after the second dose, whereas fever and the degree of leukopenia were not diminished until the third dose. After intravenous administration of LPS given in increasing doses from 0.1 to 3.2 micrograms/kg three times weekly over 7 wk, there were no measurable changes in any of the above parameters after challenge with S. marcescens LPS (0.02 micrograms/kg) after a 1-wk rest period. In awake sheep, small intravenous doses of LPS can cause physiologically important changes of the pulmonary circulation and can alter the hemodynamic and eicosanoid mediator responses to subsequent challenges with LPS. Large intravenous doses of LPS can ablate the physiological responses to subsequent small doses of LPS.\r"

Isolated limbs were pump perfused via an extracorporeal circuit with membrane oxygenator at three progressively lower flows and PO2 of both 60 and 200 Torr, whereas the rest of the body remained normoxic and normotensive. Six anesthetized, paralyzed dogs were injected with endotoxin (4 mg/kg, ENDO), and another six were controls (CONT). Limb critical O2 delivery was higher (P less than 0.05) in ENDO than CONT (8.3 vs. 6.1 ml.kg-1.min-1). Critical venous PO2 was also higher (P less than 0.05) in ENDO than CONT (38 vs. 30 Torr). Critical O2 extraction ratio was lower (P less than 0.05) in ENDO than CONT (0.60 vs. 0.73). There were no differences in these variables between low and high arterial PO2. We concluded that 1) endotoxin can cause a small but significant O2 extraction defect in skeletal muscle, 2) increasing arterial PO2 did not correct such a defect, nor did it improve O2 uptake in ischemic, but otherwise healthy, muscle, and 3) skeletal muscle may contribute to the peripheral O2 extraction defect in adult respiratory distress syndrome insofar as endotoxin effects model those found in adult respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary clearance (PCl) of inhaled aerosolized 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) across the alveolocapillary membrane is diffusion limited. Therefore, if the mixing of the 99mTc-DTPA in the aqueous hypophase underlying surfactant is slow or incomplete or if there were no hypophase, an increase in the alveolar surface area occupied by 99mTc-DTPA particles would increase the absorption rate. The aim of this study was to examine whether there is an effect on PCl of changing the number of inhaled particles. The change in particle number was accomplished by a setup of four parallel jet nebulizers feeding a central delivery chamber of 400 cm3. We performed two kinds of experiments in eight healthy nonsmokers between 28 and 52 yr of age. In the first experiment, 99mTc-DTPA in saline was nebulized in one nebulizer, while saline was nebulized in the other three. In the second experiment the number of inhaled particles containing 99mTc-DTPA was increased by a factor of four by nebulizing 99mTc-DTPA in saline in all four nebulizers simultaneously. Increasing the number of inhaled 99mTc-DTPA particles caused an increase in PCl of 24.2% (P less than 0.01). We conclude that there is a slight but significant effect of changing the number of DTPA particles on PCl and that this is probably due to an uneven mixing of the 99mTc-DTPA in the aqueous hypophase underlying the surfactant lining and the alveoli.\r"

After a 12-wk treadmill training period, carotid catheters were implanted 24 h before saline or endotoxin administration into four groups of animals: trained saline-injected (TS), trained endotoxin-injected (TE), sedentary saline-injected (SS), and sedentary endotoxin-injected (SE). Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were monitored 4 h after in vivo endotoxin or saline injection. Mean arterial pressure decreased an average of 32 +/- 3 mmHg 1 h after endotoxin administration but was normal (109 +/- 6 mmHg) 2 h later. Plasma catecholamines, in vitro myocardial performance, and isolated myocyte adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production in response to isoproterenol were assessed 4 h after endotoxin injection. Plasma catecholamine levels were 5- to 15-fold higher in SE compared with the other groups. These data suggest that myocardial protection may be related to the lowered catecholamine levels elicited in TE compared with SE in response to endotoxin administration. The product of cardiac output and peak systolic pressure, an index of cardiac work, was 24-32% greater in TS compared with SS. Cardiac work was decreased 32% in TE compared with a 45% decrease in SE. cAMP was reduced in myocytes from SE in response to isoproterenol (-28%) and to forskolin (-44%) but not in myocytes from TE, compared with TS and SS. The difference in cAMP accumulation suggests that training maintains the integrity of the beta-adrenergic receptor adenylate cyclase system, which can be depressed by in vivo endotoxin administration.\r"

A total of 86 biopsy specimens were processed using this rapid manual method, acridine orange fluorescent staining for the detection of microorganisms, and a quantitative culture for the identification and counting of bacteria in adjacent homogenized biopsy specimens. Use of these three techniques has shown their complementarity for the evaluation of sepsis in burn wound patients. The histologic study allowed a classification of the depth of bacterial involvement 4 hours after specimen collection, whereas the acridine orange fluorescent staining was useful for quantitative evaluation of infection in the same delay. Thus a rapid therapeutic decision can be made while waiting for the results of quantitative culture and sensitivity tests, which require 24 to 48 hours. We propose routine monitoring of burned patients consisting of these three tests performed simultaneously on each biopsy specimen.\r"

  ".W": "From June 1979 through January 1985, 22 infants under 20 months of age (mean 8 months and 4 kg) underwent coarctation repair with a left subclavian aortoplasty. The most commonly associated lesions were ventricular septal defect (50%), hypoplastic aortic arch (45%), patent ductus arteriosus (41%), transposition of great arteries (22.7%) and other intracardiac lesions comprised 30%. Indication for surgery was congestive heart failure refractory to medical management. All patients were on inotropic support. Two patients required mechanical ventilation preoperatively. Subclavian flap angioplasty was performed with 7.0 continuous polypropylene suture. Ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus was simultaneously done in 8 patients and pulmonary artery banding in 8 others. Four patients (18%) died within 30 days after operation; 3 of them had severe tubular hypoplasia of the aortic arch. Three transient postoperative complications were encountered; chylothorax, subclavian steal syndrome and Horner's syndrome. No hospital deaths occurred in patients with isolated coarctation of the aorta. All survivors were followed for a period varying from 3 to 6.5 years (mean, 2 years). There were 3 late deaths (13.6%). Non invasive studies have shown a satisfactory result in 14 patients with a residual gradient less than 20 mmHg and in 10 of them, cardiac catheterization and cineangiography showed no evidence of significant stenosis. In one patient only, femoral pulses were absent 4 months postoperatively. These results and reports of others indicate, contrary to the age, that the presence of associated disease affects mortality. Prompt repair of coarctation of the aorta in all infants with or without symptoms is recommended and the subclavian flap procedure appears to be a simple and safe method for relief of coarctation of the aorta in critically ill infants.\r"

A total of 30 patients were entered into each group and subsequently underwent a reconstructive procedure. Each study in the CA group was deemed accurate at the time of surgery, in assessing suitability of vessels for anastomosis. Of the patients undergoing surgery based exclusively on IADSA, 5 were noted in whom this examination provided insufficient detail or were misleading, resulting in attempted reconstructions at inappropriate sites. These results were statistically significant and indicate that IADSA should not be used as the only imaging technique in the preoperative evaluation of lower extremity vascular disease. IADSA is most useful as a complementary technique to CA and should be performed during the same examination when the latter fails to identify distal runoff vessels. In the majority of cases, CA alone will provide sufficient information and should be used as the initial contrast study.\r"

Hypotheses include the following: (1) mechanical forces act on the cell membrane and induce inhibitors of proteases, thereby maintaining the adhesion complexes; (2) the transduction of chemical signals--protease inhibition--is more flexible in young cells, wounds, and psoriasis. In old tissues, protease inhibition is more sustained; and (3) cell shape, cell migration, and mitosis are in part controlled by such mechanisms. These hypotheses are supported by evidence from the literature and observations from my experience and that of many co-workers in the fields of microcirculation, lymphatic systems, angiogenesis, wound healing, and proteases.\r"

Examination of control biopsy specimens from normal, unstimulated skin did not show eosinophils or major basic protein deposition. Five minutes after solar simulation, eosinophils were observed in vessels in the dermis, and 2 hours later there was marked tissue eosinophilia. Extracellular major basic protein was extensively deposited in the dermis at 2 and 24 hours, suggesting eosinophil degranulation. Thus evolution of the solar urticaria wheal is accompanied by infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils and by tissue deposition of the eosinophil major basic protein, suggesting eosinophil degranulation.\r"

Compliance in hemodialysis patients is most often measured by monitoring levels of blood urea nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus and by observing the amount of weight gained between dialysis treatments. To improve compliance, health professionals need to assess fully the educational level and understanding of the patient. In regimens requiring alterations of critical behavior, such as diet, changes should be made one at a time, with the next objective being added only after the patient has demonstrated adequate knowledge of the preceding step. The problem of noncompliance is multidimensional. Intervention to alter health behaviors must involve consideration of the issues of greatest concern to the patient. Simplifying the treatment plan, including family support, and making sure that the patient has a clear understanding of what is expected of him or her are some of the techniques reported.\r"

The records of 28 patients with adult epiglottitis were retrospectively analyzed to characterize the presenting features and clinical course of the disease. The diagnosis was established by laryngoscopy, lateral cervical radiographs, or both. Laryngoscopy did not precipitate airway obstruction in any patient. The majority of patients experienced a relatively benign clinical course and improved with medical management that consisted of ICU admission, intravenous antibiotics, hydration, inhaled mist, and corticosteroids. Only two patients (7%) required airway support with orotracheal intubation because of respiratory difficulty. There were no instances of respiratory arrest or airway obstruction. No tracheostomies were performed, and there were no deaths. It was concluded that adult epiglottitis can follow a less severe course than classically described.\r"

Despite technological advances in the design and manufacture of prostheses and improved surgical techniques, infection remains a serious and potentially fatal complication. Although the incidence of serious infections remains low (averaging a few per cent for totally implanted devices), the consequences of an infected prosthesis can be disastrous. The incidence of infections related to temporary or partially implanted devices is even higher than for prostheses completely covered by the skin. In addition to excess morbidity and occasionally mortality, prosthesis-related infections add to the costs of medical care and to prolonged hospitalization. the magnitude of the problem is greatly underappreciated, in part due to the care of such infections on a piecemeal basis by numerous and diverse health care specialists.\r"

The current practice of hospital infection control surveillance tends to concentrate on acute, in-hospital events. It will miss most longer-term prosthetic device infections, since they will often appear at a distance both in time and place. Currently, case report information is not reliably returned to the hospital or physician responsible for the implantation of the device. Since ongoing analysis of the epidemiologic patterns involved in these cases would seem useful, it is proposed that existing infection control units create, define, and maintain a system of net-working communication to return case data to the hospital of origin. This hospital could then combine these data with its own population data, in the hopes of generating useful epidemiologic information for the future.\r"

The overall incidence of PVE ranges from 0.98 to 4.4 per cent. Early and late PVE (that is endocarditis developing less than 60 and 60 or more days following valve implantation, respectively) accounts for 18 to 36 per cent and 64 to 82 per cent of infections, respectively. The overall mortality is 53 per cent and is higher in patients with early versus late PVE. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are responsible for a higher percentage of early (43 per cent) than late (28 per cent) infections. Streptococci are more common in late (27 per cent) than in early (3 per cent) PVE, while diphtheroids are most common in early PVE. The diagnosis of PVE may be difficult to establish, especially in patients with postoperative bacteremias who have other potential sources of extracardiac infections. Antimicrobial therapy is generally based on the susceptibility of the offending pathogen. With respect to the use of synergistic combinations, results are controversial, and most available data are derived from patients with native-valve endocarditis. Surgery remains an important aspect of treatment, and the mortality among patients who undergo early surgical intervention, particularly if their illness is complicated, is less than in those who are treated only with antibiotics. Indications for surgery include: (1) moderate-severe refractory congestive heart failure, (2) persistent bacteremia or fungemia, (3) multiple emboli, (4) myocardial abscesses, (5) relapsing PVE, and possibly (6) patients with clinical evidence of PVE and negative blood cultures and persistent fever despite 1 week or more of appropriate antibiotics. Pacemaker infections occur in less than 6 per cent of patients who undergo pacemaker insertion. These infections generally result from wound contamination at the time of surgery, and 75 per cent of infections are due to staphylococci. Staphylococcus aureus causes most infections occurring within 2 weeks after surgery, while S. epidermidis causes most later infections. The need to remove infected pacemakers is controversial.\r"

  ".W": "Infection following breast implants is an uncommon event. This is somewhat surprising, since the human breast is not a sterile anatomical structure. The flora found in the breast are derived from the nipple ducts and closely resemble those of normal skin. These organisms, predominantly S. epidermidis, may in some cases be responsible for firmness secondary to capsular contracture. Treatment of the periprosthetic infection usually involves implant removal, but salvage by systemic antibiotics is sometimes possible. Atypical mycobacteria are very rarely the cause of infection, but can be extremely difficult to eradicate when involved. Toxic shock syndrome has been reported to occur following breast implants and is a life-threatening problem requiring immediate removal of the implant. It may be significant that in some cases with effusion and infection occurring many months or years after implant placement, there has been a preceding event such as a laryngitis or flu-like illness. This suggests the possibility of a bacteremia being involved in the causation of the infection. If this were the case, then these patients should be handled in a fashion similar to those with prosthetic heart valves. Accordingly, in our own practice, we advise that penicillin \"V\" be given beforehand when a patient with breast implants is to have any dental procedure. It must be stressed that there is no statistical or scientific proof at the present time that this is of any value. In conclusion, when dealing with these large foreign bodies, absolute sterility is essential, and excellent surgical technique to obviate hematoma and the occurrence of tissue ischemia is mandatory. Evidence of severe infection necessitates implant removal, but in less severe cases a trial of intravenous antibiotics is permissible. Having removed an implant, further insertion should be deferred, preferably for 6 months. If the new implant can be placed in a different plane, that is, submuscular, this is desirable. Exposed implants can be salvaged but this requires considerable judgment and one should be prepared for re-exposure or frank infection.\r"

Studies from the 1970s and personal experience with long-term monitoring in children with Reye's syndrome and head trauma indicate that it can be done safely with a low risk of infection. What the defining variable(s) for that low infection rate might be is not at all certain. Analysis of risk factors and the development of a study design that will provide statistically valid information must be accomplished before unbiased decisions can be made concerning the use of perioperative antibiotics in the management of CSF shunts. Until that is accomplished, the risks of such therapy must be carefully balanced against the possible (but unproven) benefit.\r"

Four weeks of specific, parenteral therapy should be administered at the time of the resection arthroplasty. Reconstruction with another total joint can be performed in a \"one-staged\" or a delayed fashion. The decision as to which procedure should be performed is made based on the degree of virulence of the infection (microbiology) and the anatomic location. Successful reconstruction can be achieved in 95 per cent of carefully selected patients.\r"

We have produced a CD44 mAb (H90) which is able to block the binding of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules. H90 had no effect on [3H]TdR incorporation of whole PBL stimulated by lectins, allogeneic cells, or CD3 mAb in the soluble phase; in contrast, it strongly increased [3H]TdR incorporation of PBL stimulated by CD2 pairs of mAb or by CD3 mAb linked to the plastic culture plates, when purified T cells were used, H90 mAb could efficiently induce them to proliferate after a primary signal of activation delivered via cross-linked CD3 or via CD2, an effect mediated by Il-2 synthesis and Il-2R expression. Thus, the effect of H90 mAb resembles the mitogenic effect of CD28 \"9.3\" mAb. However, several results show that CD28 and CD44 mediate different signals to the T cells: i) in contrast to CD28 mAb, CD44 mAb cannot complement the signal delivered by a soluble CD3 mAb, lectins, or PMA; ii) CD44 mAb, at the difference of CD28 mAb, cannot induce CD3+ thymocytes to proliferate in conjunction with a first signal provided via cross-linked CD3 or via CD2; iii) F(ab) fragments of H90 were efficient, whereas divalent fragments of CD29 9.3 mAb are required to produce activation signals; and iv) CD44 and CD28 mAb produce a very strong synergistic effect on T cell proliferation. These results fit with previous ones showing that endothelial cells can play the role of accessory cell in T cell activation and that a hierarchy of signaling can be delivered to T cells via CD3 and CD2.\r"

  ".W": "Homing of recirculating lymphocytes from the blood into the lymphoid tissues is mediated by 90-kDa homing receptors on the lymphocyte cell surface, allowing selective binding to specialized endothelium lining high endothelial venules. This study describes two novel mAb, NKI-P1 and NKI-P2, directed against functional epitopes of a human lymphocyte homing receptor, gp90. Biochemical studies demonstrated that these antibodies recognize a 90-kDa glycoprotein which is similar to the Ag recognized by the mAb Hermes-1. This notion was confirmed by immunohistochemical studies showing identical reaction patterns. Furthermore, it was observed that NKI-P1 and NKI-P2 blocked adhesion of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules. Immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation studies revealed that gp90 is widely expressed on hemopoietic cells including lymphocytes, macrophages/dendritic cells, myeloid cells, and erythrocytes. The gp90 is also expressed on a number of nonhemopoietic cells such as endothelial cells, certain epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. In addition to its expression on normal cells, gp90 is present on a spectrum of tumor cell lines of lymphoid, monocytic, epithelial, glial, and melanocytic origin. In addition to the 90-kDa product, the antibodies immunoprecipitate several polypeptides in the range of 120 to 200 kDa. Interestingly, it was observed that certain mamma tumor cell-line cells lack the 90-kDa polypeptide indicating the heterogeneous expression of the molecules recognized by the antibodies. These results indicate that the 90-kDa glycoprotein homologues of the Hermes-1 human lymphocyte homing receptor are expressed on hemopoietic tissues as well as on a number of nonhemopoietic tissues and tumor cell lines. Although the function of these molecules in nonlymphoid cells is presently unknown, they might play a role in cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-linking of membrane IgG2a or IgD on the B cell lymphoma A20.1 resulted in the elaboration of lymphokines which were able to support the growth of HT-2 cells and to induce increased Ia expression on resting B cells. Unstimulated A20.1 cell did not produce detectable levels of lymphokine activity. Lymphokine secretion did not occur in response to cross-linking of MHC class II (Ia) or class I (H2K) molecules. The kinetics for secretion were rapid, with detectable levels of lymphokine arising within 3 to 4 h of stimulation. Maximal lymphokine production was reached by 8 to 10 h. Soluble intact anti-Ig antibodies failed to stimulate lymphokine production due to Fc-mediated effects. This was concluded based on the fact that soluble F(ab')2 fragments of anti-IgG, but not soluble intact antibody, stimulated the production of lymphokine by A20.1 cells. Based on serologic criteria, membrane Ig cross-linking by ligand induced secretion of IL-2 but not IL-4 by A20.1 cells. Induction of Ia expression by resting B cells in response to A20.1 supernatant was not mimicked by stimulation with IL-1, -3, -5, or -6 either singly or in combination. Furthermore, preliminary physicochemical characterization revealed that the Ia-inducing factor in A20.1 supernatant has a molecular weight greater than 50,000. These data suggest that the Ia-inducing activity is a novel lymphokine. Thus, this report describes the first evidence for the existence of a B cell tropic lymphokine produced by B cells in response to Ag receptor-mediated signal transduction.\r"

These Ag have previously been shown to relate closely to virgin and primed T cells, respectively. CD4+CD45R+ (virgin) and CD4+CD45R- (primed) cell fractions were isolated by sorting double-labeled cells with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. CD4+CD45R+ cells produced high levels of IL-2 mRNA when stimulated with either PMA together with calcium ionophore, or with PHA, but they expressed only trace quantities of mRNA for IL-4 or IFN-gamma. In contrast, CD4+CD45R- cells produced high levels of mRNA for IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma. After 14 days of continuous culture, CD4+CD45R+ Th cells lost expression of the CD45R Ag, but gained high level expression of CDw29, such that they were indistinguishable from the cell population which originally expressed this Ag. At the same time, they acquired the ability to synthesize IL-4 mRNA. It seemed likely that the broad lymphokine profile of primed Th cells might mask clonal heterogeneity. Analysis of 122 CD4+ T cell clones showed that all of them synthesized IL-2 mRNA. One clone failed to express IL-4 mRNA, but did produce those for IL-2 and IFN-gamma. A total of 34 of the clones was investigated to determine expression of IFN-gamma mRNA; two of these clones were negative for IFN-gamma mRNA, and both expressed IL-2 and IL-4 message. These data suggest that while fresh virgin and primed peripheral blood T cells show a clear resolution of lymphokine production, a simple subdivision of human CD4+ T cell clones on the basis of their lymphokine production (such as that reported for mouse Th cell clones) is not possible.\r"

Because this growth factor is present in rheumatoid synovial fluids, we studied whether this cytokine might be secreted by cells in rheumatoid synovial tissue. We show that synovial tissues from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and rats with SCW-induced arthritis, contain TGF-beta-1 mRNA. TGF-beta, predominantly type 1, was spontaneously secreted in vitro by synovial tissue explants and synovial fibroblast-like cells. In addition, TGF-beta could be detected immunohistochemically in cells throughout rheumatoid and SCW-induced arthritic rat synovial tissues. Finally, exogenous TGF-beta induced collagen and inhibited collagenase mRNA levels by cultured synoviocytes. These data support an autocrine role for TGF-beta in the regulation of synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis and, in light of its demonstrated effects on the immune system, suggest that TGF-beta might also have important paracrine effects on infiltrating inflammatory cells.\r"

  ".W": "Dextran sulfate, heparin, and certain other sulfated polysaccharides potently inhibit the adsorption of HIV to CD4+ cells. The mechanism of this inhibition is unclear and, specifically, it is unknown if these agents act at the level of CD4-gp120 binding. For example, previous reports have demonstrated that dextran sulfate does not inhibit the cell surface binding of anti-CD4 mAb known to be directed at the gp120 binding site. In order to confirm and extend these observations, in the present study, it was shown that dextran sulfate does not inhibit the binding of OKT4A, OKT4C, Leu3a, or B66.6 to CD4+ cells as measured by cytofluorography. Next, recombinant forms of CD4 (rT4) and gp120 (rgp120) were utilized to directly study their molecular interaction in the absence of other viral or cellular structures. Reciprocal solid phase ELISA assays were developed to study directly the effects of sulfated polysaccharides on the binding of rT4 to immobilized rgp120 and vice versa. Dextran sulfate, heparin, and fucoidan, but not chondroitin sulfate, inhibited the binding of rgp120 to rT4. Importantly, dextran sulfate and heparin pre-treatment of immobilized rT4, but not immobilized rgp120, inhibited rT4-rgp120 binding. Taken together, these data suggest that while both sulfated polysaccharides and anti-CD4 mAb inhibit gp120 binding, the sulfated polysaccharides interact with sites on CD4 that are distinct from those with which the antibodies bind.\r"

  ".W": "Proliferation of islet-associated leukocytes occurred when isolated islets from 20-wk-old female nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice were cultured with 10 U/ml rIL-2 for 7 days. Co-culture of these leukocytes with freshly isolated islets from 6- to 8-wk-old NOD donors in the presence of 1 U/ml rIL-2 produced islet structural deformation within 24 h and islet cytolysis within 48 h. Three lines of evidence suggest that these leukocytes were composed mainly of CTL specific for islet cells. First, morphologically, these proliferating cells adhered to NOD islets at 6 h and killed islets within 48 h of culture, but these phenomena could not be observed in the other tissues from NOD mice. These islet-derived cells were cytotoxic to NOD islet cells in a 51Cr-release assay, whereas no appreciable cytotoxicity was observed when NOD Con A-induced splenic blasts or fibroblasts were used as targets. Second, a flow cytometric analysis showed that these cells consisted of 97% Thy-1.2, 69% Lyt-2, 8% L3T4, and 4% asialo-GM1-positive cells, whereas Mac-1-positive cells could not be seen in these assays. After treatment with anti-Thy-1.2 or Lyt-2 mAb and C, these cells lost their activity to lyse NOD islet cells. However, these cells still had a full killing activity after the depletion of L3T4 or asialo GM1-positive cells. Third, islet cells from BALB/c, DBA/2, and B10.GD mice which share the same H-2K Ag with NOD mice were susceptible to cytolytic activity of these cells, whereas islet cells from NON, C57BL/6, C57BL/10, and C3H mice remained intact. Furthermore, anti-Kd antibody was capable of blocking this cytolysis. These results suggest that CTL expressing Thy-1.2 and Lyt-2 phenotypes appear to recognize the islet cell Ag with the restriction of MHC class I Kd, and then destroy NOD islet cells.\r"

Progressively shortened variants of mature IL-6 were constructed at the cDNA level and expressed in Escherichia coli. Mutant proteins were recovered from refractile bodies by solubilizing in 6 M guanidine-HCl. The mutant protein concentration in these preparations was estimated by Western blotting by using an IL-6-specific mAb and the biologic activity was measured in the B9 (hybridoma growth factor) assay. The first 28 amino acids of mature IL-6 could be removed without significantly affecting biologic activity. A further removal of amino acids 29 and 30 resulted in an approximately 50-fold decrease, whereas removal of amino acids 31 to 34 virtually abolished the activity. The mutants showed the same reaction pattern in three other IL-6 assays: induction of murine thymocyte proliferation, induction of fibrinogen synthesis by a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2), and the induction of IgM synthesis by an EBV-transformed B cell line. This suggests that a single functional domain might be responsible for all four activities of IL-6.\r"

  ".W": "The macrophage-activating properties of murine recombinant granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF were studied in murine peritoneal macrophages with respect to metabolism, endocytosis, PGE2 and TNF-alpha release, and tumor cytotoxicity. GM-CSF was found to be a potent stimulus for RNA and protein synthesis, glucose consumption, pinocytosis, and FcR-independent phagocytosis. Macrophages were activated by GM-CSF to kill TNF-alpha-insensitive Eb lymphoma cells but failed to generate cytotoxicity against TNF-alpha-sensitive L929 cells. Although GM-CSF alone was incapable of stimulating TNF-alpha release, it primed macrophages for elevated TNF-alpha production in response to IFN-gamma plus LPS. The priming effect of GM-CSF disappeared upon longer incubation (greater than 12 h) and was followed by a strongly reduced responsiveness to stimuli that release TNF-alpha. Late-stage suppression could be reverted by treatment with the cyclooxygenase blocker indomethacin, and GM-CSF-induced priming for enhanced TNF-alpha release was entirely restored. The responsible arachidonic acid product mediating suppression was found to be PGE2, because 1) GM-CSF-primed macrophages released enhanced amounts of PGE2 and 2) indomethacin-restored macrophages were again suppressed when exogenous PGE2 was added back in amounts produced by GM-CSF-primed macrophages. Although GM-CSF potently induced TNF-alpha gene transcription by 20 h of treatment, PGE2 interfered with translation into the secreted TNF-alpha protein. These data show that GM-CSF is capable of priming for the enhanced release of two factors, initially for TNF-alpha and subsequently for PGE2. The temporally delayed generation of these two mediators suggests an autoregulatory circuit in which the later produced PGE2 limits GM-CSF-induced macrophage activation.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of terminal complement components on the generation and release of the complement C5a fragment was investigated by comparing the levels of C5a in complement-activated serum with the levels of C5a produced in serum depleted of complement C6. In order to investigate the release of C5a, a modified C5a assay was developed that utilizes an anti-C5b monoclonal antibody to remove C5, C5b, and C5b-C5a complexes from samples prior to C5a assay. The modified assay was developed because the standard methodology, which includes an acid-precipitation step designed to dissociate C5a and C5b, cannot distinguish free C5a from the C5a that is bound to C5b. Therefore, the standard methodology is not capable of monitoring the influence of terminal components on C5a/C5b dissociation. Levels of C5a were measured in complement-activated whole human serum, in serum depleted of C6, and in serum containing inhibitory levels of anti-C6 Fab using both the modified C5a assay and the standard methodology. Sera were complement-activated with either zymosan to activate the alternative complement pathway or with antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes to activate the classical pathway. The levels of free C5a in C6-depleted sera after activation were equivalent to the C5a levels in activated whole serum, indicating that C6 is not required for the release of C5a from C5b. In addition, the quantity of C5a detected in zymosan-activated sera using the standard acid-precipitation methodology was greater than C5a levels when assayed using the modified immunoadsorption technique, confirming that acid-treatment enhances the C5a dissociation and promotes C5a recovery. Since the other terminal components, C7, C8, and C9, bind to C5b only after C5b only after C6 is bound, these results indicate that none of the terminal components are required for the release of C5a. Although the terminal components could influence the rate of C5a release, the quantity of C5a released in serum was entirely independent of terminal components.\r"

  ".U": "89309805\r", 
  ".W": "The expression of CD45 isoforms and of CDw29 has been analyzed as a function of time by correlating cell surface phenotype with mRNA synthesis. After activation, T cells lose CD45R and acquire a high density of CD45 p180 and of CDw29. Throughout this transition the density of CD45 common determinants steadily increases, resulting in a net gain of surface CD45. The gradual loss of CD45R could reflect a rapid switch in CD45 mRNA splicing patterns followed by a slow loss of surface CD45R. Alternatively it could reflect a delayed activation of splicing to produce the 4.8-kb CD45 mRNA, or long lived 5.4-kb CD45 mRNA. Analysis of CD45 mRNA indicated that at 24 h postactivation, 5.4-kb CD45 mRNA is lost and only 4.8-kb mRNA is detectable. The amount of 4.8-kb mRNA increases until day 3 and then decreases somewhat. Thus our results support the interpretation that transitions in CD45 isoform mRNA expression occur within the first 24 h after activation and that the persistence of CD45R+ T cells until day 3 to 4 of culture results from slow turnover of surface CD45R glycoprotein.\r"

Mice and rabbits were inoculated with this conjugate using CFA, SAF-1, or aluminum phosphate as adjuvants. The peptide conjugate was highly immunogenic in both animal species, giving rise to polyclonal antibodies with a similar epitope specificity as the original mAb. Antibody titers were dependent on the route of immunization. Rabbit antibodies produced in sufficient quantity for biologic assays inhibited parasite growth in vitro. This synthetic peptide thus shows promise as an immunogen for use in synthetic vaccine design.\r"

The results show that the MDNCF/IL-8 gene consists of 4 exons and 3 introns with a single \"CAT\"- and \"TATA\"-like structure. The 5'-flanking region of MDNCF/IL-8 gene shows no overall sequence similarity with that of other cytokine and acute phase reactant genes whose production is also affected by IL-1 and TNF. The 5' flanking region, however, contains potential binding sites for several nuclear factors including activation factor-1, activation factor-2, IFN regulatory factor-1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1. In addition, the glucocorticoid responsive element and heat shock element were located in the 5'-flanking region. Inasmuch as PMA induces MDNCF/IL-8 mRNA accumulation in human PBMC and a glucocorticoid inhibits the induction of MDNCF/IL-8 mRNA by LPS, the expression of this gene is probably regulated by interaction of these nuclear factors with the 5'-flanking DNA.\r"

  ".U": "89309829\r", 
  ".W": "Previous findings revealed that reticulum cell sarcoma (RCS) of SJL/J mice growth and survival depended on its ability to stimulate a potent host T cell response, by the means of a tumor-associated class II MHC molecule with IE-like specificities. Previously we presented evidence that the V beta 17a TCR+ clonotype of T cell was the predominant T cell involved in the host response to the tumor. We undertook our study to examine whether the depletion of the V beta 17a+ T cells, by the use of the anticlonotypic antibody, KJ23a, resulted in the inhibition of RCS tumor growth in vivo. We present evidence herein that supports this hypothesis. KJ23a-treated mice exhibited a complete reduction in T cells bearing the V beta 17a TCR. These mice exhibited a dramatic reduction in the in vitro proliferative response to RCS. Furthermore, the pretreatment of SJL/J mice with KJ23a mAb resulted in the complete loss in their ability to harbor RCS tumor. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with a single inoculum of KJ23a mAb within the first 7 days after the passage of tumor, the mice showed long term survival with diminishing tumor burden. These results demonstrated that the V beta 17a clonotype of T cells is required for the growth and maintenance of RCS tumor. Within the first 6 wk after tumor inoculation KJ23a-treated mice were capable of transferring tumor to naive syngeneic recipient mice despite the obvious lack of tumor growth in the treated donor animal. These results suggested that RCS tumors in the absence of V beta 17a+ T cells can persist for up to 6 wk in a state of \"tumor dormancy.\" The predominant usage of the V beta 17a gene in RCS-specific T cells suggests that these T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of RCS tumor. Furthermore, the positive therapeutic course taken by tumor-bearing mice upon the treatment with KJ23a mAb, demonstrates the enormous potential in anticlonotypic antibody therapy in the treatment of T cell-dependent tumors and diseases.\r"

In the present study, lifted cultures were found to more closely reproduce the lipid composition of the parent epidermal tissue than submerged cultures grown on plastic. In addition, the specific fatty acid profile of individual lipid classes in lifted cultures was, in general, remarkably well maintained in vitro. Acylceramides, which are highly enriched in linoleic acid in vivo, remained enriched in vitro; however, the linoleic acid content of the cultures was substantially lower than that in vivo, confirming previous reports of the relative essential fatty acid deficiency of standard culture media. As the lifted cultures differentiated over time, the lipid composition changed to reflect the formation of a stratum corneum with its different complement of lipids. Label from [U-14C]linoleic acid was specifically incorporated into linoleate-containing lipids during short pulses in both submerged and lifted cultures. Changes in label distribution over a long chase period in lifted cultures indicated that linoleate was transferred from phospholipids to ceramides, providing evidence for the \"recycling\" of essential fatty acids in epidermis.\r"

Most T cells in the inflammatory diseases and patch/plaque mycosis fungoides expressed the immunophenotype characteristic of the vast majority of mature peripheral T cells: CD3+ TCR-beta+ TCR-delta-. In contrast, abnormal CD3/TCR-beta antigen expression was seen in 3 of 6 cases (50%) of tumor stage mycosis fungoides. Furthermore, we were able to document its evolution from the normal pattern present in earlier patch/plaque lesions of the two cases in which serial biopsies were available for study. Divergence of epidermal versus dermal CD3/TCR-beta antigen expression was seen in 2 of 34 (6%) of biopsies of patch/plaque mycosis fungoides but not in inflammatory controls. The TCR-delta+ cells were generally rare regardless of diagnosis. We conclude that inflammatory skin diseases and most patch/plaque mycosis fungoides are typically composed of T lymphocytes that resemble mature peripheral T cells in regard to their expression of TCR-associated antigens. In contrast, aberrant patterns of TCR-associated antigen expression can be seen in tumor stage MF, and, more rarely in patch/plaque MF.\r"

The aim of this study was to identify changes in collagen (the major structural protein of the skin) in ultraviolet irradiated mouse skin using immunochemical and biochemical techniques. Specific antibodies directed against the aminopropeptide of type III procollagen were used in immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies. Immunofluorescent staining of irradiated and nonirradiated mice skin showed that the aminopropeptide of type III procollagen was distributed throughout the dermis in a pattern similar to that observed for type I collagen. Extracts of irradiated (5 and 10 weeks) and nonirradiated skins were then subjected to immunoblotting techniques. Levels of pN alpha 1, type III procollagen (measured by radioimmunoassay) were reduced in the extracts prepared from skins of mice that were irradiated for 5 and 10 weeks. Immunoelectron microscopy verified the loss of pN alpha 1 type III procollagen in irradiated skin. Collagen fibers of nonirradiated skin demonstrated normal labeling with antibody directed against the aminopropeptide of type III procollagen. In contrast, collagen fibers of 10 week irradiated skin failed to label with this antibody. The pN alpha 1 type III collagen is known to coat type I collagen fibers of normal skin. Therefore, its absence from the surface of type I collagen fibers of irradiated skin may play a role in the development of the elastotic material.\r"

The only other major HLA-DR positive dermal cell type noted in these studies, the dermal microvascular endothelial cell (DMVEC), appeared to express lesser amounts of HLA-DR region gene product than did this dermal perivascular dendritic cell (DPDC). These DPDC were particularly common around small vessels in the superficial vascular plexus of the papillary dermis and were distinct from the mast cell, another cell type normally seen in a similar location. Phenotypic and ultrastructural studies have determined that the DPDC is more closely related to the monocyte/macrophage lineage than the dendritic cell lineage. The perivascular location and phenotype of this cell distinguishes it from other previously described constitutive dermal cell types such as the classic \"histiocyte,\" veiled cell, and dendrocyte. The relatively rich expression of all three major HLA-D region gene products by this dermal perivascular dendritic macrophage would suggest that it could play a significant role in the immunobiology of the dermal microvascular unit.\r"

  ".W": "Because prolactin has been implicated in the transport of electrolytes in several mammalian tissues, we have looked for the presence of prolactin in human eccrine sweat glands where a primary isotonic secretion, rich in sodium chloride, is produced and subsequently modified by recovery of some sodium and chloride in excess of water. Sweat glands were microdissected from skin biopsies and then fixed overnight in phosphate-buffered 4% formaldehyde. The fixed tissue was dehydrated (to 95%) in ethanol and then embedded in glycol methacrylate. Sections were cut (5 microns) and immunostained with antihuman prolactin (NIDDK IC2) and the specifically-bound antibody was visualized using a biotinylated second antibody and Vector ABC reagents. Prolactinlike immunoreactivity was localized in the clear cells of the secretory coil and, to a much lesser extent, in the basal layer of duct cells. In many of the clear cells, the immunoreactive material appeared as a lateral strip and occasionally, in favorable sections, as a horseshoe of reaction product a few microns in from the apical and lateral membranes. In a subset of clear cells, with more euchromatic nuclei and a long, thin cellular profile, the immunostaining was more intense and was localized in a more juxtanuclear position. Controls for endogenous peroxidase, and those using normal serum or antihuman prolactin serum preabsorbed with purified human prolactin, gave no peroxidase localization in the tissue. These results are important because 1) they represent the first demonstration of prolactin or a prolactinlike substance in the sweat gland, 2) the prolactinlike material was localized to clear cells that are thought to be responsible for much of the fluid secretion, 3) the necessity for prolactin or pituitary extract in primary cultures of sweat gland epithelium is potentially explained, although not fully understood, and 4) it means that further studies concerned with the possible influence of prolactin on ion transport in the sweat gland are warranted.\r"

We found distinct differences of p21ras expressions by the type of melanoma. Nodular melanoma, epithelioid cell type melanoma, and deeply invading melanoma revealed higher reactivity with anti-p21ras monoclonal antibody than the other types. The reactivity of melanomas appeared to correlate with the degree of malignancy of the melanoma. It was also demonstrated, however, that part of melanocytic nevi reacted with anti-p21ras monoclonal antibody with a relatively strong intensity. Melanocytic nevi with junctional activity and nevus cells located in the epidermis in compound nevi did not show the positive reaction in contrast to dermally located nevus cells that had relatively strong reactivity. The different p21ras expression among the type of tumors may represent the state of tumor cells differentiation with greater expression with more immaturity in the melanocyte lineage. p21ras expression does not appear to represent a marker of malignant transformation.\r"

  ".U": "89309885\r", 
  ".W": "The CD11/CD18 family of leukocyte adhesion-promoting proteins is comprised of three members, each composed of a shared beta subunit (CD18) noncovalently associated with unique alpha subunits (CD11a, CD11b and CD11c respectively). Such three heterodimers, named LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), H-Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and gp150,95 (CD11c/CD18), are involved in mediating leukocyte adhesion in virtually all phases of the immune responses. Since Langerhans cells are regarded as cutaneous leukocytes, we investigated the expression of the members of the CD11/CD18 family on Langerhans cells. A vast series of immunostaining procedures was carried out, using monoclonal antibodies anti-CD11a, -CD11b, -CD11c, and -CD18. Normal skin frozen sections and epidermal sheets were investigated by immunohistology and immunofluorescence; suspended freshly isolated epidermal cells were processed using immunogold techniques, performed in both transmission and scanning electron microscopy, including double labeling procedures and semiquantitative analysis of the labeled cells. The results demonstrated the expression on the membrane of Langerhans cells of the CD11b, CD11c and CD18 antigens, thus indicating that at least both the H-Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and the gp150,95 (CD11c/CD18) members of the CD11/CD18 family are detectable on the cell surface of human resting Langerhans cells. Since both such moieties serve as adhesion molecules in (a) cell-cell interactions and in (b) leukocyte migration and localization, the present results suggest that H-Mac-1 and gp150,95 might display a key role (a) in promoting interactions between Langerhans cells and other cells, and (b) in guiding the migration and localization of Langerhans cells.\r"

Subjects of all four groups were matched for age, sex and other main characteristics. Depressed and nondepressed Parkinsonians were also matched for duration and severity of illness, and for the type of antiparkinsonian treatment. The response to MTP was evaluated in the context of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Parkinsonian patients with major depression exhibited a significant lack of sensitivity to the euphoriant effects of MTP, in comparison with the other three groups. Euphoria produced by central stimulants has been shown to depend on the activity of a dopamine synapse in humans, which is thought to be situated at the limbic terminals of dopamine neurons located in the ventral tegmental area. Degeneration of this system may have predisposed our Parkinsonian patients to major depression.\r"

For a similar decrease in the Columbia rating scale, the nature of long term side effects was different in the two groups: three patients on levodopa developed peak-dose dyskinesias and one other dystonia. With bromocriptine, one patient developed a severe psychosis whereas 3 others suffered from primary lack of efficacy (1 case) or late decrease in efficacy (2 cases). These results demonstrate the potential of D2 dopamine agonists (like bromocriptine) in the de novo treatment of Parkinson's disease; however, their use is limited by their lack of efficacy and/or the occurrence of neuropsychiatric side effects.\r"

The three TCD stages of intracranial circulatory arrest, which have been described previously, corresponded with different levels of extracerebral angiographic cessation of flow. With TCD progression from the first stage (oscillating flow) to the third stage (no flow), the level where the dye stopped descended caudad from subarachnoid to cervical levels. The study shows that, in progressing intracranial hypertension, arterial circulatory standstill within the cranial cavity develops in a distal-to-proximal direction. The basal cerebral arteries remain patent in the early stages of intracranial circulatory arrest. Experimental evidence from the literature, together with the findings of the present investigation, points to the capillary bed as the initial site of the flow obstruction in progressing intracranial hypertension.\r"

The results demonstrate that the IL-2 (5 to 20 U/ml)-dependent proliferative response of glioma-derived TIL's was inhibited 70% to 85% by G-TsF/TGF beta 2 and that the inhibitory effect could be reduced by using increasing concentrations of IL-2 (100 to 200 U/ml). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) enhanced the IL-2-dependent proliferation of TIL's cultured in low concentrations of IL-2 (10 U/ml); however, neither TNF alpha nor interferon gamma was able to reduce the inhibitory effect of TGF beta 2 on TIL proliferation. In addition, TGF beta 2 suppressed 60% to 100% the cytotoxic response of glioma-derived TIL's against several tumor targets, including autologous glioma cells, and the suppressive effect was shown to be reduced by increasing concentrations of IL-2.\r"

Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the c-myc oncoprotein was highly expressed in neoplastic cell lines and in glioblastoma tumor specimens. In contrast, anti-c-myc oncoprotein staining was not present in a non-neoplastic glial cell line or in a benign brain tissue specimen. Immunoblot analysis revealed two distinct c-myc oncoprotein bands, having molecular weights of 64 and 75 kD. Densitometric determinations of the relative levels of the 64-kD protein were in good agreement with the determinations made by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was also used to relate the quantity of the c-myc oncoprotein present in the cells to their cell cycle phase. In the malignant cultured cells, the protein underwent an approximate twofold increase as the cells progressed from G1/G0 to G2/M in the cell cycle. The present results suggest that the c-myc oncoprotein may prove to be a useful marker for the proliferation status and/or malignancy of glial cells.\r"

Twelve adult rhesus monkeys underwent bilateral resection of a portion of the peroneal nerve followed by placement of autogenous sural nerve interposition fascicular grafts. The grafts were completed with conventional microsurgical suture technique on one side and with LANA on the other. At 5, 8, 10, and 12 months, the grafted nerves were evaluated for continuity, nerve conduction, and histology (both light and electron microscopy). No significant difference in continuity, conduction velocity, nerve degeneration, nerve regeneration, axon fiber number, or axon fiber density was found in any animal between grafts performed by conventional microsuture and LANA grafts. There was no difference in distal or proximal myelinated fiber density between the LANA grafts and the conventional microsuture grafts. It was concluded that LANA is as effective as microsurgical suture nerve anastomosis in a primate model of nerve repair and grafting.\r"

The activity of efferent fibers to the pancreas, liver, and adrenal medulla is modulated by both central glucose-responsive neurons and peripheral (gustatory, intestinal and hepatic) glucose sensors. It is well known that induction of hyperglycemia facilitates efferent activity of the pancreatic and hepatic branches of the vagus nerve. This in turn increases insulin secretion from the pancreas and glycogen synthesis in the liver. Hypoglycemia activates efferent activity of the pancreatic, hepatic and adrenal branches of the splanchnic nerve, and this results in increased glucagon secretion from the pancreas, release of glucose from the liver and secretion of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla. Glucose-responsive neurons in the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata may be involved in the modulation of this autonomic efferent activity.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary copper (Cu) was restricted in Swiss albino mice during five discrete intervals over a 9-wk period of perinatal development: gestation only (G), lactation only (L), 3 wk postlactation (PL), 1 wk after birth through postlactation (2/3L + PL), and lactation plus postlactation (L + PL). Biochemical and immunological status of mice in copper-deficient (-Cu) treatment groups in models G and L did not differ from that of copper-adequate (+Cu) controls. Signs of severe copper deficiency, such as low liver copper levels, and significant reductions in activity of plasma ceruloplasmin and splenocyte Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase were most evident in 6-wk-old mice from two groups, -Cu 2/3L + PL and -Cu L + PL. Mice in these groups were anemic and had small thymuses and enlarged spleens compared to controls receiving +Cu treatment. The -Cu mice demonstrated impaired antibody (plaque-forming cells, PFC) response to sheep erythrocytes, and the attenuation was proportional to copper deficiency, as judged by liver copper levels. Total plasma IgM levels were not greatly altered by -Cu treatment except in model L + PL. Total IgG levels were markedly reduced in this group and in the -Cu 2/3L + PL group. The PFC response of mice in the -Cu PL group was normal even though signs of copper deficiency were evident; however, the PFC response was reduced when -Cu treatment was extended to 5 wk and was reversible by switching to +Cu treatment. Splenocyte reactivity to B- and T-cell mitogens was not greatly different between groups. Incorporation of thymidine into DNA in the absence of mitogen was higher in -Cu mice. It is evident that severity of copper deficiency is related to degree of impaired immunity. Furthermore, severity of copper deficiency is dependent on duration and time of initiation of dietary copper restriction.\r"

A total of 190 patients were treated in four university departments. These patients presented for treatment with mandibular bone heights that ranged from 4 to 18 mm (mean, 10 mm). After postoperative periods that ranged from 3 months to 5 years, 182 of the 190 implants (95.8%) were stable and functional. Three implants were removed due to perioperative fractures in mandibles with 4 to 6 mm of bone height. Five were removed due to infection which occurred within the first 3 months after surgery. Reversible complications that developed in 22.2% of the patients were treated successfully. The 182 implants in function demonstrated no mobility and no infrabony pockets around any of the transmucosal posts. The results of this study demonstrate that the transmandibular implant has acceptable predictability and reliability for reconstruction of patients with severe atrophy of the mandibular alveolar process.\r"

  ".W": "By employing a constant-rate (1 microliter/hr) constant-dose intrathecal infusion pump in rats, groups received a 7-day infusion of one of three concentrations (in nmol/hr) of each of the following receptor preferring ligands: morphine (mu: 2, 6, 20), sufentanil (mu: 0.06, 0.2, 0.6), DAMGO (mu: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0), DADLE (delta: 2, 6, 20) or ST-91 (alpha-2: 3, 10, 30). On day 7 the magnitude of tolerance was assessed by establishing i.t. dose-response curves for the effect of the chronic drug given as a bolus. Each infused animal was used for one bolus injection. It was observed that for all drugs, a parallel rightward shift in the dose-response curve was produced with the degree of shift proportional to the log of the infusion dose. Of particular significance was the finding that drugs differed significantly in the magnitude of the shift produced by the chronic infusion of equieffective concentrations. Thus, at the intermediate infusion dose, the degree of the shift in the bolus dose-response curve (i.e., magnitude of tolerance) for morphine, DADLE, ST-91, DAMGO and sufentanil was 55, 46, 29, 7 and 2, respectively. These data are interpreted to suggest that agents with high potency and a significant receptor reserve will produce a smaller shift in the dose-response curve (e.g., sufentanil and DAMGO) than the similar infusion of an equieffective dose of another agent with less potency and a smaller population of spare receptors (morphine).\r"

  ".U": "89311031\r", 
  ".W": "The novel compound 2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (NPC 12626) was evaluated for activity in a variety of tests associated with receptors for excitatory amino acids. NPC 12626 failed to inhibit the specific binding of RS-[3H] amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid or [3H] kainic acid to brain membranes in vitro but displaced both agonist and antagonist binding to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. Like cis-(+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid, NPC 12626 competitively blocked NMDA-induced enhancement of [3H]-1-thienylcyclohexyl)piperidine binding. In the voltage-clamped frog oocyte expression system, NPC 12626 was a competitive inhibitor of NMDA-evoked inward current with a pA2 of 6.24. After both i.c.v. or i.p. administration, NPC 12626 was a potent anticonvulsant in the pentylenetetrazol, maximal electroshock and NMDA seizure models. Furthermore, low doses (25 mg/kg) of NPC 12626 given i.v. were effective in preventing damage to the CA1 region of hippocampus in the gerbil model of global ischemia. Unlike the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, phencyclidine, but like cis-(+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid and pentobarbital, NPC 12626 only partially substituted for phencyclidine in a drug discrimination study. The results of the current study indicate that NPC 12626 is a novel, systemically active and competitive NMDA receptor antagonist.\r"

  ".W": "Guanine nucleotides were shown to alter N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-effector coupling by competitive antagonism at the glutamate binding site, rather than via interaction with an intracellularly located GTP-binding protein. Thus, in contrast to known G-protein linked receptors, micromolar concentrations of guanine nucleotides and their analogs decreased both agonist [( 3H]glutamate) and antagonist [( 3H]-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid binding to the NMDA receptor complex. The most potent compound, the GDP analog guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S), was studied in detail. GDP beta S exhibited almost 200-fold selectivity for the glutamate recognition site vs. the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding site. IC50 values were 2.7 +/- 1.4 and 484 +/- 97 microM, respectively. GDP beta S also inhibited N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl-3H]piperidine binding (IC50 was 28.0 +/- 3.7 microM) in an NMDA-reversible fashion. [3H]-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid saturation binding studies revealed an increase in Kd from 263 +/- 49 (control) to 552 +/- 134 nM (8 microM GDP beta S) without any change in maximum binding (4.94 +/- 0.34 and 5.19 +/- 0.58 pmol/mg of protein, respectively). GDP beta S was also a competitive inhibitor of the following NMDA-stimulated responses: elevation of cyclic GMP in neonatal rat cerebellar slices, release of preloaded [3H]norepinephrine from superfused rat hippocampal slices and elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration in fura-2-loaded cultured rat forebrain neurons. IC50 values were 78.4, 53.4 and 1.6 microM, respectively. Finally, GDP beta S resembled known NMDA receptor antagonists in its ability to block NMDA receptor-induced seizures after i.c.v. administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Salmonella enteritidis septic arthritis is more common in SLE than in patients with others connective tissue diseases. We report that 4 of 7 patients with SLE with glomerulonephritis and history of Salmonella enteritidis septic arthritis were chronic carriers of this bacteria, since positive cultures were obtained from feces, bone marrow and bile fluid from 20 84 months after Salmonella arthritis developed. In contrast, none of 24 patients with SLE without a history of Salmonella arthritis were chronic carriers and only one of 12 patients with rheumatoid arthritis had positive bile culture to S. typhi while otherwise being asymptomatic. From our study we conclude that patients with active SLE who have gomerulonephritis are at increased risk of becoming chronic carriers of Salmonella enteritidis and of developing Salmonella arthritis once combined prednisone cyclophosphamide treatment has begun. A chronic Salmonella carrier state must be ruled out in patients with active SLE living in endemic zones, before initiating immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

Many rats developed arthritis without clinical uveitis, but uveitis was rare in the absence of arthritis. Histologically, the ocular inflammation was characterized by a polymorphonuclear, and later, a lymphocytic infiltration of the iris and ciliary body with cells and fibrinous exudate in the anterior chamber and cells in the vitreous. Antibodies and cellular immunity to ocular (S antigen, alpha crystallin), articular (type II collagen, proteoglycan) and bacterial components (MDP), were demonstrated in some rats, but positive tests did not correlate with either articular or ocular disease. Ten percent of rats given type II collagen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant developed uveitis. Thus, the pathogenesis of the arthritis and uveitis in the adjuvant model may be mediated by lymphocytes which exhibit crossreactivity with antigens in these structures, although the specificity of such antigens has not been identified in our studies.\r"

An important observation in our blinded study was that tender point sites among patients with fibromyalgia were significantly (p less than 0.001) consistent at 3 as well as 6 weeks when compared with the baseline.\r"

This disease-specific development of IPO was initially stimulated by observations that the compound was activated by metabolism, preferentially within the mammalian lung, specifically within bronchiolar Clara cells, and that its predominant toxicity was to the lung in most species. IPO is inactive or only minimally active against most conventional antitumor test systems. However, some human lung cancer cell lines, as well as a variety of fresh human lung tumor biopsy specimens, have been shown to be capable of mediating the in situ biotransformation of IPO to a potentially cytotoxic intermediate. In this report, the biochemistry, metabolism, preclinical pharmacology, and toxicology of IPO are reviewed and the clinical development plans for this unique and challenging new agent are presented.\r"

Findings of major interest were (a) deletion of A and B determinants in tumors from histo-blood group A and B individuals, and a high incidence of H antigen deletion in tumors from group O individuals were observed and (b) strong expression of incompatible A antigen in two of 10 samples from group B patients and in two of nine samples from group O patients was demonstrated. A antigen expression was defined by monoclonal antibody AH21, which reacts with monofucosyl type 1 chain A (ALed), but not by other types of anti-A antibodies directed to difucosyl type 1 chain A (ALeb), mono- or difucosyl type 2 chain A, or type 3 or type 4 chain A. The reactivity of monoclonal antibody AH21 was abolished by alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from chicken liver. These findings clearly identified the specific expression of incompatible A antigen with the structure monofucosyl type 1 chain A (ALed) in tumors from histo-blood group B and O individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Altered glucose metabolism and lactic acidemia are features of Gram-negative polymicrobial abscesses, but the relationship between carbohydrate metabolism and the aerobic or anaerobic organisms is unclear. Since reductions in the % active pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHa) limits glucose oxidation in sepsis, the effect of a 7-day monoclonal (E. coli or B. fragilis) vs. biclonal (E. coli + B. fragilis) intra-abdominal abscess (IA) on PDHa and lactate concentrations in skeletal muscle (SM) and plasma was studied in rats. A chronic IA was created by the intraperitoneal introduction of a sterile rat fecal-agar pellet (1.5 ml) inoculated with a known bacterial flora [sterile (S); E. coli 10(6) CFU/ml (EC); B. fragilis 10(8) CFU/ml (BF); E. coli 10(3) CFU/ml + B. fragilis 10(4) CFU/ml (ECLBF); E. coli 10(3) CFU/ml + B. fragilis 10(8) CFU/ml (ECHBF)]. Neither SM PDHa nor SM nor plasma lactate were altered from control in animals with either sterile (S) or E. coli (EC) monoclonal IA, but SM PDHa was significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced and SM lactate increased (p less than 0.05) in rats with B. fragilis 10(8)/ml (BF) monoclonal IA. In biclonal IA, the effect of sepsis on SM PDHa depended on the concentration of B. fragilis in the IA fluid (ECLBF = 10(4) CFU/ml vs. ECHBF = 10(8) CFU/ml) since the E. coli were constant (10(3) CFU/ml). At the lower B. fragilis IA concentration (ECLBF), the SM PDHa was not different from control. However, when the IA B. fragilis concentration was increased to 10(8) CFU/ml (ECHBF), the SM PDHa was significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased relative to control. A decreased muscle PDHa was always associated with elevated SM and plasma lactate concentrations. These results suggest that IA which permit a threshold of relatively nonlethal (BF = 0% mortality) anaerobic B. fragilis (greater than or equal to 10(8) CFU/ml) to enter the circulation are more important in altering metabolic control of skeletal muscle glucose oxidation and in producing lactic acidemia than are IA with only aerobic E. coli. However, in biclonal intra-abdominal abscesses, B. fragilis potentiated the early mortality from E. coli (EC = 6% vs. ECHBF = 37% mortality), suggesting that the metabolic effect of the B. fragilis-induced lactic acidemia is synergistic with the direct toxic effects of the E. coli.\r"

  ".W": "It is well documented that endotoxin can have immunosuppressive effects on lymphocytes and induce the production and secretion of monokines which act on the lymphocytes. To delineate the interaction between macrophages and lymphocytes more clearly, 0.15 mg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (E. coli 0111:B4) was injected into Hartley guinea pigs intraperitoneally twice a day for 7 days (saline for control group). Seven days after the last injection, spleens were taken and lymphocyte proliferation was determined in the presence and absence of macrophages. When macrophages were present, there was a significant suppression of lymphocyte proliferation when PHA and PWM were used as mitogens. There was no suppression of proliferation when the macrophages were removed. Splenic macrophages were also cultured in the presence and absence of LPS and their supernatants analyzed for PGE2 and TXB2. There was no significant difference between the endotoxin and control groups for PGE2 or TXB2 production in the presence and absence of LPS. However, the endotoxin group had significant decreases in serum levels of C3 postinjection of endotoxin which could indicate C3 degradation by LPS. Taken together these results give further evidence that macrophage products in addition to PGE2 can inhibit lymphocyte proliferation. C3 degradation products could possibly stimulate macrophages to produce inhibitors of lymphocyte proliferation or induce suppressor cells.\r"

The activation of macrophages by exposure to hypoxia (pO2 less than 20) and/or lipopolysaccharide (10 micrograms/ml) in vitro was investigated for its effect on macrophage regulation of fibroblast proliferation. The effect on fibroblast proliferation of conditioned medium from activated murine macrophages or co-culture with activated macrophages was tested by measuring 3T3 fibroblast incorporation of 3H-thymidine and culture DNA content. Unstimulated macrophages produced growth factors that increase fibroblast proliferation (proliferation index (PI) = 1.4 +/- 0.15, p less than 0.05 vs. control). Activation by hypoxia alone had little effect on macrophage regulation of fibroplasia (PI = 1.55 +/- 0.28, N.S. vs. unstimulated macrophages). LPS activated macrophages suppressed fibroplasia and the combination of hypoxia with LPS augmented the suppression (PI = 0.5 +/- 0.11, LPS alone, p less than 0.05 and 0.25 +/- 0.05, LPS + hypoxia, p less than 0.01). In addition, hypoxia + LPS treated co-cultures had reduced DNA contents, suggesting reduced cell numbers (12.5 +/- 2.6 micrograms vs. 8.2 +/- 2.0 micrograms). We screened several macrophage cytokines for their direct effect on 3T3 proliferation and found that mr-Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (150 units) also suppressed proliferation. Conditioned supernatants from LPS activated macrophages contained 12 +/- 2 units of mrTNF as measured by L929 cytolysis; however, this was significantly less than required to induce suppression of proliferation by direct addition. The regulatory role of the macrophage appears to be dependent on its level of activation. Activation by hypoxia and LPS altered macrophage regulation of fibroblast proliferation from stimulation to suppression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Side effects were present but in no case necessitated discontinuation of treatment. Drop-out rates were equal to conventional treatment offered at the clinic. The availability of clonidine broadens the therapeutic options available to patients and clinicians in treating the opiate-addicted patient. Transdermal clonidine offers several advantages over the oral form: patches can be applied weekly, fewer supplemental medications are required, and patches supply an even blood level of medication. A protocol for use is recommended.\r"

In this manner the renal graft is located in an anatomical position that is well protected, and with the recipient urinary tract the normal physiology is preserved with comparatively low complication and mortality rates. A third transplant attempt also is simplified. This method is the only alternative in some cases. Transplant ureter pathology symptoms are not observed.

  ".W": "The effects of hyperosmolality induced by high concentrations of NaCl and urea on the functions of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was examined. Phagocytosis, intracellular killing of bacteria and superoxide production were inhibited under hyperosmotic conditions. The mechanism of the inhibition of superoxide production was different for NaCl and urea. The inhibition by NaCl was indirect and abolished at 4C and the inhibition by urea was immediate, direct and not abolished at 4C. The intracellular ATP content of leukocytes under hyperosmotic conditions induced by NaCl was significantly reduced and this reduction was abolished at 4C. On the other hand, ATP content under such conditions induced with urea was not reduced. These results suggest that the inhibition of leukocyte function by NaCl is due to an exhaustion of energy source caused by an activation of Na-K pump, and the inhibition by urea is direct inactivation of leukocytes and not due to energy exhaustion.\r"

Our recent experience with 3 patients with cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma prompted a critical review of the literature to evaluate risk factors for recurrence and present treatment programs. A total of 38 patients, including our 3 patients, with cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma were divided into 2 groups: those with recurrent (7) and those with nonrecurrent (31) tumors. A statistical comparison of clinical and pathological data was performed. Of the 7 patients with local recurrence and/or pulmonary metastasis, 3 died. The average time to first recurrence was 5.4 months. Histological differences were not predictive of recurrent disease. Pathologically positive surgical margins (p less than or equal to 0.02) were the only statistically significant variable suggesting recurrent disease. While the presenting age was not predictive of recurrence (p equals 0.27), the relative risk of recurrence doubles in the first 3 months of life and quadruples after 6 months of life. Treatment programs also were evaluated. An infant with cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma, regardless of age, is cured with surgery alone given clear pathological margins. In 4 of 5 children with recurrent tumors Wilms tumor treatment agents (vincristine and actinomycin D) failed to control local or distant disease. Of these cases 2 subsequently were treated with sarcomatous chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin) and both are in remission. These agents may prove to be more efficacious in the treatment of local or metastatic disease.\r"

To determine whether the radiographic abnormalities might be secondary to the neurosurgical procedure in a manner analogous to spinal shock, a prospective study of 34 newborns with myelomeningoceles was done during a 5-year period. Renal and bladder sonography was done on day 1 of life before surgical intervention and for varying periods thereafter. A total of 31 infants (91 per cent) had normal renal sonograms preoperatively but 6 of these had bilateral hydronephrosis and distended bladders postoperatively. Three patients had urinary retention before postoperative sonography could be obtained. For these 9 patients intermittent catheterization was required for 4 to 14 days until bladder tone recovered. Urinary retention in the infant with myelomeningocele may be a transient consequence of the myelomeningocele repair and should be treated conservatively for at least 2 weeks before surgical intervention is considered seriously.\r"

To investigate the relationship between renal superoxide dismutase content and age we selected formalin-fixed normal human renal tissue from subjects of varying age, ranging from premature infant to adult, for immunostaining with human anti-superoxide dismutase antibody using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. Sections that demonstrated acute pyelonephritis were immunostained for comparison. Immunostaining for superoxide dismutase was detected consistently in the proximal tubular cell cytoplasm in all specimens regardless of subject age. Superoxide dismutase was not detected in other segments of the nephron. In kidneys that demonstrated acute pyelonephritis we detected enhanced immunostaining in the proximal tubules, as well as increased background staining related to the inflammatory cells present. These results in conjunction with recent demonstrations of proximal tubular cell endocytosis of bacteria suggest that superoxide dismutase has an important role in mediating the initial events of pyelonephritis within the proximal tubular cell.\r"

We have been confronted with 44 renal units in 35 neonates diagnosed as having primary obstructive megaureter during the last 6 years. Of these units 23 in 17 infants were diagnosed antenatally and 20 (87 per cent) have been managed without surgical intervention. Notably, 16 renal units were graded as moderate to severe megaureters by an excretory urogram. The decision to manage conservatively was based on the initial extraction of the 99mdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal scan (the extraction factor). This estimate of absolute renal function has been used to differentiate dilatations with obstructive implications for the renal parenchyma from those without. Significantly, expectant treatment has resulted in improvement of dilatation on sequential excretory urograms in 15 megaureters and none has shown a deterioration of function by renal scan. Similar diagnostic criterion also has resulted in conservative management for 12 of 21 additional neonatal megaureters seen during this period with symptoms or they were discovered serendipitously. Only 2 of these 12 megaureters required surgical correction. The neonatal primary megaureter appears in many cases to represent a different entity than those that commonly presented before the advent of antenatal and perinatal diagnosis.\r"

Postnatal sonography performed in the first few days after birth confirmed upper tract dilatation in 39 kidneys (80 per cent) in 29 neonates and it was normal in 10 kidneys (20 per cent) in 6 neonates. Of the 6 neonates with a normal postnatal sonogram 5 underwent repeat renal sonography at an average of 2 months after birth, all showing moderate hydronephrosis (7 kidneys). Furosemide-enhanced diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renography was performed in 4 infants (5 kidneys) with ureteropelvic junction or megaureter obstruction, of whom 2 had persistent unilateral obstruction and underwent successful reconstructive surgery (1 pyeloplasty and 1 megaureter reimplantation). Two infants (3 kidneys) with nonobstructive dilatation are being followed while 1 infant with bilateral vesicoureteral reflux is being managed medically on long-term antimicrobial prophylaxis. Thus, 50 per cent of neonates with antenatal hydronephrosis and a normal postnatal sonogram performed during the first few days of life subsequently were found to have either significant obstruction (2 requiring surgery) or reflux. This study underscores the absolute necessity of followup sonography in all newborns with antenatal hydronephrosis that is not confirmed on the initial postnatal ultrasound.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophilic leukocytes have been implicated as important mediators of ischemic myocardial injury. We investigated the role of neutrophils in skeletal muscle ischemia/reperfusion injury by using the rat hindlimb ischemia model. We rendered Wistar rats neutropenic by administering 750 rad of whole-body radiation (mean white blood cell count, 300 +/- 50/mm3; 3 days after radiation). In anesthetized rats (10 neutropenic and 10 control), 3 hours of ischemia were induced in one hindlimb by application of a tourniquet to the proximal thigh; the contralateral limb served as an internal, nonischemic control. After 1 hour of reperfusion the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were excised bilaterally and evaluated for ischemic injury by means of a quantitative spectrophotometric assay of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) reduction. In control rats the reduction of TTC by ischemic muscle averaged 27.0% +/- 7.3% of that by nonischemic muscle; whereas in neutropenic rats the value for ischemic muscle was 65.4 +/- 11.6% (p less than 0.05). To determine if the contribution of the neutrophils to ischemic injury is due to oxygen-derived free radical formation, an additional 10 animals were infused with 5000 units of super-oxide dismutase and 10,000 units of catalase at the time reperfusion was restored. After treatment with free radical scavengers, TTC reduction by ischemic limbs was 25.5% +/- 7.0% of that by nonischemic limbs and did not differ from that in control animals (p greater than 0.05). The results show a protective effect of neutropenia and suggest a significant role of the white cell in the pathophysiology of ischemic skeletal muscle injury.\r"

Misuse of x-rays and radium prompted efforts to encourage radiation safety and to set limits on exposure, culminating in the first recommended \"tolerance doses\" in 1934. After World War II, the problems of radiation protection became more complex because of the growing number of people subjected to radiation injury and the creation of radioactive elements that had never existed before the achievement of atomic fission. Judging the hazards of radiation became a matter of spirited controversy. Major public debates over the dangers of radioactive fallout from atmospheric bomb testing in the 1950s and early 1960s and the risks of nuclear power generation in later periods focused attention on the uncertainties about the consequences of exposure to low-level radiation and the difficulties of resolving them.\r"

Most of the wastes are from using nuclear power to produce electricity, but 25% to 30% are from medical diagnosis, therapy, and research. Exposures to radioactivity from the wastes are much smaller than those from natural sources, and federal standards limit public exposure. Currently operating disposal facilities are in Beatty, Nev, Barnwell, SC, and Richland, Wash. National policy encourages the development of regional facilities. Planning a regional facility, selecting a site, and building, monitoring, and closing the facility will be a complex project lasting decades that involves legislation, public participation, local and state governments, financing, quality control, and surveillance. The facilities will utilize geological factors, structural designs, packaging, and other approaches to isolate the wastes. Those providing medical care can reduce wastes by storing them until they are less radioactive, substituting nonradioactive compounds, reducing volumes, and incinerating. Physicians have an important role in informing and advising the public and public officials about risks involved with the wastes and about effective methods of dealing with them.\r"

Average costs and revenues per inpatient day were $681 and $545, respectively, with a cost per patient per year of $17,910. Estimated cost for AIDS inpatient care during 1987 was $486 million; Medicaid represented the primary payer. Regional and ownership comparisons for this year and between 1985 and 1987 indicated significant differences in utilization, payer source, and financing. Results suggest major differences in reimbursement and losses related to payer source or lack of insurance, with many hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income persons with AIDS encountering moderate to severe financial shortfalls. We conclude that increasing concentrations of persons with AIDS in relatively few hospitals in large cities may make it more difficult to secure the broader political base necessary to obtain adequate support for treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Academic medicine is entrusted by society with the responsibility to undertake several important social missions toward improving the health of the public, including education, patient care, and research. This trust is given implicit authority by generous public funding and considerable autonomy. Medical academia can take pride in its successes, manifested by a premier scientific establishment, the development and use of sophisticated medical technologies and drugs, and the recent dramatic declines in death rates from heart disease and stroke. Academic medicine, however, has been relatively unresponsive to a number of vexing public problems, including skyrocketing expenditures for medical care, substandard indexes of population health, uneven quality of care, an unfavorable geographic and specialty mix of physicians, and widespread disability from long-term medical and psychiatric problems. Although there are many cogent reasons why academic medicine has chosen to define its task relatively narrowly (the nature of its funding successes, the intractability of the social problems, and the attractiveness of the biomedical model), the central issue is how well academic medicine is fulfilling its responsibilities to the public. To the degree that academic medicine defines its central mission narrowly, it may violate its implicit social contract and jeopardize its primary source of financial support. Alternatively, in recognition of its public responsibilities, academic medicine can choose to expand its current activities to be more responsive to the health concerns of the general population.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium entry blockers will be increasingly used for the treatment of hypertension. The currently available calcium entry blockers are similar in antihypertensive efficacy but differ in their effects on the atrioventricular node and the degree of peripheral vasodilatory action. The new generation of dihydropyridine calcium entry blockers exhibits more specific vasodilatory actions with a less negative inotropic effect, which may affect their use in patients with congestive heart failure. The responsiveness to these drugs is little affected by race or age. Because of their mild natriuretic action, the concomitant use of dietary sodium restriction or diuretics may be less necessary. Short-term administration of calcium entry blockers preserves or improves renal function; however, their long-term effect has not been documented. Calcium entry blockers have not exhibited protection against coronary heart disease, but experimental evidence supports the continued search for cardioprotection. Calcium entry blockers are important drugs for the treatment of hypertension; the second generation may provide additional benefits because of its more specific pharmacologic actions.\r"

The percentage of gamma-ray leakage was calculated by a simultaneous reading of two probes at 1-minute intervals (one over the precordial area and one over the thigh) and this was compared to results of simultaneous blood sampling from the perfusate and systemic circulation at 15-minute intervals for gamma well counting (GWC). The percentage of leakage recorded by the GDPs was essentially identical to that detected by the GWC (7.3% and 8.2%, respectively at the conclusion of the perfusion). The GDP gives an immediate and accurate indication of the percentage of leakage during HILP, making it a safer procedure.\r"

Since the initial description in 1956, the stiff-man syndrome has been reported to occur in various clinical and neurologic settings. In this study, we reviewed the current state of knowledge about this syndrome, defined diagnostic criteria, provided a long-term follow-up of the disorder, and assessed rehabilitative attempts in affected patients. Use of rigorous criteria that identify patients who have the stiff-man syndrome is important because the initial clinical manifestations are similar to those of other neuromuscular diseases. Analysis of 13 patients with stiff-man syndrome examined at the Mayo Clinic during the past 30 years revealed that treatment with diazepam decreased the muscle spasms. Because some muscle spasms usually persist, rehabilitation is an important adjunct that may further improve function when it is centered on the treatment of low-back pain and hyperlordosis, mobility problems, gait abnormalities, and muscular stiffness.\r"

These patients were surveyed for sleep habits or sleep complaints and then studied with overnight polysomnography for sleeping or breathing abnormalities. None of these patients had obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. From this sample population, an incidence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome of no more than 26.5% in the surgical population of patients with class II malocclusion can be extrapolated.\r"

Certain cognitive functions such as memory and conceptual processes seem to be preferentially impaired. The degrees of impairment of other functions such as attention and visuospatial skills are now being evaluated. Psychiatrically, affective disorders seem to be the most common diagnoses, and debate exists about whether these abnormalities are a function of the demyelinating process itself or are a reaction to the disability produced by the disorder.\r"

Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis has been treated with a number of immunosuppressive regimens, several of which have shown promise to date. Cyclophosphamide and azathioprine have been used most often and are reviewed in this report, as are other agents currently under investigation. No firm guidelines for the treatment of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis can be offered, but an approach to immunosuppressive therapy is suggested in this review.\r"

Of 28 evaluable patients, shell vial cell culture assay and histologic findings provided the first evidence of CMV infection earlier in 22 (79%) or at the same time as the serologic response in 5 (18%). Serologic results yielded the first indication of CMV infection in only 1 of these 28 patients (3%). Of 17 evaluable transplantations in 15 patients in whom symptomatic invasive disease developed, shell vial culture or histology provided a laboratory diagnosis of CMV infection earlier or at the same time as serologic responses in 16 (94%). Similarly, shell vial culture or histology provided evidence of CMV infection in 10 of 11 patients (91%) who had asymptomatic CMV infection and remained asymptomatic. Urine surveillance cultures yielded the first evidence of CMV infection in 14 of 19 patients who initially had an asymptomatic infection, of which 6 became symptomatic. Culturing of the blood with use of the rapid shell vial technique showed that viremia preceded CMV organ involvement in 7 of 10 patients. We recommend culture by the shell vial assay as the most rapid and sensitive method of determining CMV infection in liver transplant patients.\r"

  ".W": "The current classification of hepatic allograft rejection recognizes \"acute rejection\" and \"chronic rejection.\" Although these terms convey duration, implicitly they have been defined on the basis of their morphologic manifestations. This usage causes contradictions in reports and publications because features of \"chronic rejection\" may occur acutely and vice versa. In the future, biopsy reports, clinical communications, and, in particular, evaluation of treatment might benefit from use of a classification and terminology that more clearly distinguish clinical and morphologic findings and that reserve \"acute\" and \"chronic\" for describing the duration of episodes of rejection and terms such as \"cellular rejection\" or \"arteriopathic rejection\" for biopsy reporting. Severity should be graded independently for clinical, laboratory, and morphologic findings, inasmuch as an overall grading is not always meaningful--for example, severe cellular rejection may be mild in terms of prognosis, whereas histologically mild rejection may prove incurable. For an overall evaluation of graft rejection, adjectives such as \"mild\" or \"severe\" should be replaced or at least supplemented by terms that describe results of treatment and thus prognosis, and a designation should be added for duration and histology--for instance, \"acute rejection, cellular, corticosteroid-responsive.\" Use of such a well-defined clinicopathologic classification of rejection and precise terminology might improve documentation and communication; it might even become a prerequisite for the evaluation of treatment trials.\r"

Currently, the 1-year survival rate after liver transplantation is more than 80% in major liver transplantation centers, in contrast with approximately 60% before the availability of cyclosporine. Its predominant immunologic effect is inhibition of lymphokine production and secretion by helper T cells. The use of cyclosporine, however, is associated with numerous adverse effects, the most important of which are nephrotoxicity, hypertension, neurotoxicity, opportunistic infections, and malignant lesions. Acute nephrotoxicity, hypertension, and neurotoxicity usually can be reversed by decreasing the dose of cyclosporine. Measurement of cyclosporine concentrations in the blood is essential for optimization of immunosuppressive therapy and prevention of toxicity.\r"

The nurse who is responsible for the care of liver transplant patients requires special preparation to meet the patient's needs during the critical phases of the liver transplant process. In the hospital setting, a primary nursing-care delivery system enhances the nurse's role in supporting the goal of patient recovery. Primary nursing places the accountability and responsibility for planning, administering, and evaluating the care of the liver transplant patient with the primary nurse. The transplant nurse acts as a key link in the communication network within the multidisciplinary team, and effective communication is essential in the care of the liver transplant patient. For achievement of a life-style of independence after transplantation, the patient is assisted by the nurse, who provides instruction in such areas as diet, medications, monitoring of vital signs, and record keeping. Although the nurse is only one member contributing to the care of liver transplant patients, the nurse's role in the success of treatment is vital.\r"

A mathematical model to predict survival in the patient with PBC who has not undergone transplantation would be valuable for improving selection of patients for and timing of transplantation and for providing control information for assessment of the efficacy of transplantation. The Cox regression method and data from 312 Mayo Clinic patients with PBC were used to develop a model based on age, total serum bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time, and severity of edema. When cross-validated on an independent set of 106 Mayo patients, the model accurately predicted their survival. It was similar to two other published survival models in terms of risk measurement but had the advantage of not necessitating liver biopsy. The model was used to assess the efficacy of liver transplantation by comparing the Kaplan-Meier survival of 32 Mayo patients after transplantation with the average model prediction of survival without transplantation. Beyond 3 months after transplantation, Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities were significantly greater than control survival predicted by the model (P less than 0.001). Examples of using the model for aiding in selection of patients for and timing of transplantation are provided.\r"

Attacks were graded mild (231) if uncomplicated, or severe (59) when major organ failure or a pancreatic collection occurred. Only APACHE-II scores were available at the time of admission; they correctly predicted outcome in 77% of attacks and identified 63% of severe attacks, compared with 44% achieved by clinical assessment. After 48 h, APACHE-II was most accurate, and correctly predicted outcome in 88% of attacks, compared with 69% for Ranson and 84% for Imrie scores. APACHE-II predicted 73% of pancreatic collections at 48 h, compared with 65% for Ranson and 58% for Imrie scores. In acute pancreatitis, APACHE-II may facilitate rapid selection of patients for intensive therapy or clinical trials, improve comparison between groups of patients, and indicate that a pancreatic collection is probable.\r"

Three patients received combination chemotherapy and two received irradiation. Three patients died of progressive disease. One patient who had yolk sac carcinoma of the temporomandibular region is alive and free of disease 40 months after therapy.

Subsequently, the same surgical technique using PMMCF instead of the platysma myocutaneous flap was used for reconstruction following total laryngopharyngectomy in eight patients. The new partially tubed flap was successful in solving the problem of excessive bulkiness of the totally tubed PMMCF.\r"

Fifteen of the 35 studied muscles evolved toward total necrosis, whereas the others showed signs of recovery over a 2-5-hour postexercise period. Those muscles which did not subsequently recover contained significantly more inorganic phosphate (Pi) at rest (before exercise) than those which recovered. It is suggested that under acute ischaemic conditions the Pi level at rest is correlated with the extent of blood flow restriction and can be used to predict the severity of the ischemia.\r"

The fiber distribution of myosin HC isozymes was further investigated on muscle cryostat sections by an indirect immunofluorescent technique. Fetal myosin HC was found to be expressed in a subpopulation of severely atrophic fibers, alone or together with the slow form of myosin HC. Triangulated fibers of intermediate size contained fetal and fast myosin or fast myosin alone. The hypertrophic fibers were characterized by the predominant expression of slow myosin HC; but in some of these fibers, also low amounts of HC fetal were found to be expressed. These findings are discussed in relation to developmental transitions of myosin heavy chains in human muscle.\r"

  ".W": "We measured serum erythropoietin levels serially in 31 renal-transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine, using the recently developed recombinant human erythropoietin-based radioimmunoassay. The mean (+/- SEM) serum erythropoietin concentration in these patients before transplantation (14 +/- 2 U per liter) was similar to that in normal subjects who did not have anemia. A transient postoperative 9-fold increase (range, 0- to 74-fold) in the serum erythropoietin levels was followed by a smaller (3-fold) and sustained (28 +/- 3 days) second elevation. The initial increase occurred in the absence of graft function and was not accompanied by an erythropoietic response, whereas the second increase was associated with graft recovery and the complete resolution of the anemia. Serum erythropoietin levels returned to normal as the hematocrit rose above 0.32. Thereafter, the hematocrit continued to rise toward normal, while the serum erythropoietin levels remained normal. The patients in whom erythrocytosis or iron-deficiency anemia developed had persistently elevated serum erythropoietin levels. We conclude that in patients who have undergone renal transplantation, slight increases in endogenous erythropoietin levels induce erythropoiesis to the same extent as do large doses of exogenous erythropoietin in patients with uremia. Moreover, once initiated, erythropoiesis in renal-transplant recipients may be sustained by normal serum erythropoietin levels. These results suggest that the restoration of renal function improves the erythropoietic response to erythropoietin.\r"

Thirteen persons exposed to estimated total-body doses of 5.6 to 13.4 Gy received bone marrow transplants. Two transplant recipients, who received estimated doses of radiation of 5.6 and 8.7 Gy, are alive more than three years after the accident. The others died of various causes, including burns (the cause of death in five), interstitial pneumonitis (three), graft-versus-host disease (two), and acute renal failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome (one). There was hematopoietic (granulocytic) recovery in nine transplant recipients who could be evaluated, six of whom had transient partial engraftment before the recovery of their own marrow. Graft-versus-host disease was diagnosed clinically in four persons and suspected in two others. Although the recovery of endogenous hematopoiesis may occur after exposure to radiation doses of 5.6 to 13.4 Gy, we do not know whether it is more likely after the transient engraftment of transplanted stem cells. Because large doses of radiation affect multiple systems, bone marrow recovery does not necessarily ensure survival. Furthermore, the risk of graft-versus-host disease must be considered when the benefits of this treatment are being weighed.\r"

The oysters in all eight restaurants were supplied by the same dealer, but examination of a routine water sample collected six days before the probable time of contamination showed the waters where the oysters were harvested to be free of fecal contamination, making widespread sewage contamination unlikely. The suspect oysters were traced to a single boat. Stool swabs from that boat's oyster harvesters allowed the identification of one asymptomatic carrier who had a strain of S. sonnei (determined by colicin typing, plasmid analysis, and testing for susceptibility to antibiotics) that was similar to or the same as that infecting the patients. Although the source of this man's infection was unknown, he reported having eaten no oysters. Investigation revealed that 5-gallon (19-liter) pails were used as toilets aboard the oyster boats. Sewage collected in these pails was often dumped overboard into the harvesting area. We conclude that this outbreak of S. sonnei resulted from poor sanitary procedures that probably allowed stool from a carrier to contaminate oysters either just before or after they were taken aboard the boat.\r"

  ".W": "Marked abnormalities in cardiovascular function accompany septic shock, and bacterial endotoxin is believed to be one of the principal mediators of these abnormalities. To evaluate the cardiovascular effects of endotoxemia in humans, we measured hemodynamic variables in nine normal subjects given an intravenous bolus dose of endotoxin (Escherichia coli, 4 ng per kilogram of body weight) and in six normal subjects given a bolus dose of saline, before and three hours after administration. All the subjects then underwent volume loading with normal saline (mean, 2217 ml) during the fourth and fifth hours after administration of the bolus, and the measurements were repeated. Three hours after the administration of endotoxin and before volume loading, the cardiac index had increased by 53 percent and the heart rate by 36 percent (both changes were significant; P less than or equal to 0.008), and the systemic vascular-resistance index had decreased by 46 percent (P = 0.004). After volume loading (five hours after the administration of endotoxin), the left ventricular ejection fraction decreased by 1 percent of the base-line value in the subjects given endotoxin, but increased by 14 percent in the controls (P = 0.008). The left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes increased by 18 percent (P = 0.07) and 24 percent (P = 0.042), respectively. Left ventricular performance, as measured by the ratio of the peak systolic pressure to the end-systolic volume index, was depressed (a decrease of 0.90 in the subjects given endotoxin vs. an increase of 0.76 in the controls; P = 0.024). We conclude that the administration of endotoxin to normal subjects causes a depression of left ventricular function that is independent of changes in left ventricular volume or vascular resistance. The changes in function are similar to those observed in septic shock and suggest that endotoxin is a major mediator of the cardiovascular dysfunction in this condition.\r"

Serum urate levels became elevated in 90 percent of the patients in the cyclosporine group who were treated with diuretics, as compared with 60 percent of those not treated with diuretics (P = 0.001); in the azathioprine group, the corresponding values were 47 percent and 15 percent (P = 0.0001). Serum urate levels did not correlate with trough blood cyclosporine levels in a selected subgroup (n = 40) of patients from the cyclosporine group, who were studied from 4 to 96 weeks after transplantation. Detailed studies of urate metabolism in six cyclosporine-treated patients revealed normal turnover rates for urate and decreases in creatinine and urate clearance, as compared with seven control subjects. We conclude that hyperuricemia is a common complication of cyclosporine therapy and is caused by decreased renal urate clearance. Gouty arthritis is the cause of considerable morbidity among renal-transplant recipients who receive cyclosporine.\r"

  ".W": "To identify early metabolic abnormalities in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we measured sensitivity to insulin and insulin secretion in 26 first-degree relatives of patients with NIDDM and compared these subjects both with 14 healthy control subjects with no family history of NIDDM and with 19 patients with NIDDM. The euglycemic insulin-clamp technique, indirect calorimetry, and infusion of [3-3H]glucose were used to assess insulin sensitivity. Total-body glucose metabolism was impaired in the first-degree relatives as compared with the controls (P less than 0.01). The defect in glucose metabolism was almost completely accounted for by a defect in nonoxidative glucose metabolism (primarily the storage of glucose as glycogen). The relatives with normal rates of metabolism (mean +/- SEM, 1.81  +/- 0.27 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute) and impaired rates (1.40 +/- 0.22 mg per kilogram per minute) in oral glucose-tolerance tests had the same degree of impairment in glucose storage as compared with healthy control subjects (3.76 +/- 0.55 mg per kilogram per minute; P less than 0.01 for both comparisons). During hyperglycemic clamping, first-phase insulin secretion was lacking in patients with NIDDM (P less than 0.01) and severely impaired in their relatives with impaired glucose tolerance (P less than 0.05) as compared with control subjects; insulin secretion was normal in the relatives with normal glucose tolerance. We conclude that impaired glucose metabolism is common in the first-degree relatives of patients with NIDDM, despite their normal results on oral glucose-tolerance tests. Both insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion are necessary for the development of impaired glucose tolerance in these subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Recent advances have made organ transplantation in newborns feasible, but the paucity of organs small enough for this age group remains a major limitation. Because anencephalic infants can survive for no more than a few weeks, they have been considered as possible organ donors for other infants. Under current law, however, they cannot be used as donors until their brain-stem activity ceases and the criteria for total brain death are thereby met. If anencephalic infants receive customary care, their solid organs usually undergo irreversible hypoxic injury during the process of dying and become unsuitable for donation by the time of death. We modified the medical care of 12 live-born anencephalic infants for one week to determine whether organ viability could be maintained and whether the criteria of total brain death could be met. Six received intensive care from birth, and six only when signs of imminent death developed. Only two infants met the criteria for total brain death within one week, and no solid organs were procured. Most organs were suitable for transplantation at birth. When intensive care was provided from birth, organ function was maintained; however, brain-stem activity ceased in only one infant within the first week. When intensive care was delayed until death was imminent, most organs were damaged to an extent that made them no longer suitable for transplantation. Our findings suggest that it is usually not feasible, with the restrictions of current law, to procure solid organs for transplantation from anencephalic infants.\r"

  ".U": "89314116\r", 
  ".W": "We carried out a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the capacity of aspirin to prevent pregnancy-induced hypertension and to alter prostaglandin metabolism. A total of 791 pregnant women with various risk factors for pre-eclamptic toxemia were screened with use of the rollover test (a comparison of blood pressure before and after the woman rolls from her left side to her back) during week 28 or 29 of gestation. Of 69 women with abnormal results (an increase in blood pressure during the rollover test), 65 entered the study and were treated with a daily dose of either aspirin (100 mg; 34 women) or placebo (31 women) during the third trimester of pregnancy. The number of women in whom pregnancy-induced hypertension developed was significantly lower among the aspirin-treated than among the placebo-treated women (4 [11.8 percent] vs. 11 [35.5 percent]; P = 0.024); the same was true for the incidence of preeclamptic toxemia (1 [2.9 percent] vs 7 [22.6 percent]; P = 0.019). The mean ratio of serum levels of thromboxane A2 to serum levels of prostacyclin metabolites after three weeks of treatment decreased by 34.7 percent in the aspirin-treated group but increased by 51.2 percent in the placebo-treated group. No serious maternal or neonatal side effects of treatment occurred in either group. We conclude that low daily doses of aspirin taken during the third trimester of pregnancy significantly reduce the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclamptic toxemia in women at high risk for these disorders, possibly through the correction of an imbalance between levels of thromboxane and prostacyclin.\r"

  ".U": "89314117\r", 
  ".W": "There is evidence that aspirin in low doses favorably influences the course of pregnancy-induced hypertension, but the mechanism, although assumed to involve suppression of the production of thromboxane by platelets, has not been established. We performed a randomized study of the effect of the long-term daily administration of 60 mg of aspirin (n = 17) or placebo (n = 16) on platelet thromboxane A2 and vascular prostacyclin in women at risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension. Low doses of aspirin were associated with a longer pregnancy and increased weight of newborns. Serum levels of thromboxane B2, a stable product of thromboxane A2, were almost completely (greater than 90 percent) inhibited by low doses of aspirin. The urinary excretion of immunoreactive thromboxane B2 was significantly reduced without changes in the level of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, a product of prostacyclin. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that aspirin reduced the excretion of the 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 metabolite--mainly of platelet origin--by 81 percent and of thromboxane B2, probably chiefly of renal origin, by 59 percent. The urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and of its metabolite 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was not affected. Low doses of aspirin only partially (63 percent) reduced neonatal serum thromboxane B2. No hemorrhagic complications were observed in the newborns. Thus, in women at risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension, low doses of aspirin selectively suppressed maternal platelet thromboxane B2 while sparing vascular prostacyclin, but only partially suppressed neonatal platelet thromboxane B2, allowing hemostatic competence in the fetus and newborn.\r"

A small percentage of T cells, however, do not express alpha beta but a second type of TCR complex designated gamma delta (ref. 2). Unlike alpha beta+ lymphocytes, gamma delta+ lymphocytes do not generally express CD4 or CD8 molecules, and the nature of antigen recognition by these cells is unknown. To study antigen recognition by gamma delta+ lymphocytes we raised a gamma delta+ alpha beta- -CD4-CD8- line from an individual immune to PPD (purified protein derivative). This line showed a specific proliferative response to PPD and to a recombinant mycobacterial heat-shock protein (HSP) of relative molecular mass 65,000 (65K). The gamma delta+ line was shown to exhibit a major response to HSP in the presence of autologous antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Minor responses occurred, however, with APCs matched for some HLA class I or II antigens, whereas no response occurred with HLA-mismatched APCs. These findings, therefore, document the requirement of HSP-reactive gamma delta+ lymphocytes for histocompatible APCs.\r"

A second type of aberrant segregation, post-meiotic segregation, results from the segregation of two genotypes from a single haploid spore; in yeast such events are detected as sectored spore colonies and usually occur rarely. Post-meiotic segregation is thought to result from the replication of heteroduplex DNA formed during meiotic recombination. We report here that if the heteroduplex includes a palindromic insertion sequence, a high frequency of post-meiotic segregation results. This suggests that palindromic insertions are poorly repaired, which may be the result of hairpin-loop formation that affects the efficiency of repair of heteroduplex DNA.\r"

Specific 125I-insulin and 125I-IGF-I binding was demonstrated by competition-inhibition binding assays. Insulin binding was measured in plasma membrane preparations from 9 freshly isolated human meningiomas, 4 glioblastomas multiforme (GBMs), a low-grade glioma, a normal adult brain, and a fetal brain. IGF-I binding was measured in similar preparations from 5 meningiomas, 4 GBMs, a low-grade glioma, and a normal adult brain. Incubations were carried out at 4 degrees C for 18 to 20 hours. Meningiomas showed higher specific insulin binding per 0.25 mg of protein than GBMs (19% versus 3%, P less than 0.005), and this difference was not related to small differences observed in insulin degradation. By contrast, IGF-I binding was significantly higher in gliomas than in meningiomas (27% versus 12%, P less than 0.05). Also, IGF-I binding was significantly higher than insulin binding in GBMs (27% versus 3%, P less than 0.03); binding of both IGF and insulin was high in meningiomas. In normal adult brain IGF-I and insulin binding was 7 to 10%. The ability of insulin to support and enhance the growth of central nervous system tumor cells in culture was investigated. Cell cultures were derived from a freshly isolated glioblastoma, a low-grade glioma, and 3 meningiomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These patients, who were treated 6 or more hours after onset, had hematomas larger than 8 ml and were unable to raise an arm and/or leg on the affected side. Craniotomy was performed in 15 other patients, most of whom were brought to the hospital with large hematomas within 6 hours of onset. The remaining patients either had mild deficits of consciousness (33 patients) or severe deficits and/or were elderly (18 patients) and were treated conservatively. Thirteen patients (7.4%) showed rebleeding after stereotactic aspiration (6 instances of major and 7 instances of minor rebleeding). Craniotomy and removal of the hematoma were required in three of these patients. Aspiration should be avoided in patients who have a tendency for bleeding, even if mild, because rebleeding occurred in 6 of 23 such patients (26%) in these study. The consciousness level improved in 66 patients (38%), was unchanged in 103 patients (59%), and was worse in 6 patients (3%) 1 week postoperatively. Motor function of the arm improved in 55 patients (31%) and was worse in 23 patients (14%). Six months after surgery, the results for the 175 patients who underwent stereotactic aspiration were: 19% excellent, 32% good, 35% fair, 7% poor, 6% dead, and 1% unknown.

The technique is based on multiple intersecting arc irradiations focused on a stereotactic target. From November 1984 to October 1988, 97 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations have been treated. Seventy-nine patients suffered one or more than one hemorrhage. Four patients had progressive neurological symptoms. In 14 patients, epilepsy was the principal complaint. Stereotactic localization was performed by stereotactic angiography. Lesion dimensions varied from 4 to 40 mm in diameter. Doses from 18.7 to 40 Gy were delivered in one or two sessions. Mean follow-up is 17.1 months (from 1 to 49). Four instances of minor rebleeding were observed after treatment; 3 patients complained of transient neurological deterioration. Of 56 patients who were followed longer than 1 year, 50 underwent 12-month follow-up angiography. In 26 patients complete obliteration of the malformation was demonstrated (52%), in 12 patients subtotal obliteration was obtained (24%), in 11 patients the obliteration was evident but not significant (22%), and in 1 patient the AVM was unchanged. Other angiographic features in incompletely obliterated cases were a significant reduction of flow velocity through the malformation together with a reduction in diameter of both feeding arteries and draining veins.\r"

This paper describes the procedures for selection of patients, the treatment protocol, and the neurological and neuroradiological responses to stereotactic radiosurgery in this age group. The volumes of the treated AVMs ranged from 265 mm3 to 60,000 mm3. The results are favorable: thus far, 20 of 25 patients have experienced greater than or equal to 50% obliteration of their AVMs within 1 year after treatment, and 14 of 18 patients have experienced total obliteration of the AVM by 2 years after treatment. Two patients hemorrhaged from radiosurgically treated AVMs within 12 months after treatment, but none thereafter. Complications include vasogenic edema and arterial occlusion; three patients have had neurological worsening as definite or possible sequelae of treatment. The strengths and limitations of the method are discussed.\r"

With patients in the supine position, intrathoracic PEEP-dependent venous hypertension was clearly transmitted to the intracranial compartment but without intracranial hypertension. On the contrary, with patients in the sitting position PEEP had no influence in almost half of our patients. In patients with radiological or clinical signs of increased ICP, however, the combination of head flexion and rotation with institution of PEEP caused a dangerous increase in ICP, even when the patients were in the sitting position. The need for early withdrawal of cerebrospinal fluid in these patients is stressed.\r"

All patients undergoing exenteration from 1962-1986 were reviewed, of whom 24 had concurrent grafts. The mean operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay were not different in patients with versus without grafts. The rate of fistula formation in the hospital was less in the graft group (P = .004) but was not different when compared with contemporary patients only. The total infection rate (wound and pelvic) was decreased in the graft group (P = .04) when graft infections were excluded. The major problem with the graft was significant necrosis of the flap(s) in nine of the 24 patients. There were no life-threatening complications attributed to concurrent placement of gracilis myocutaneous flaps. Experience with the technique is improving the cosmetic and functional outcome of the neovagina formed with the graft. Patients most likely to benefit from this procedure include those requiring immediate reconstruction or those with potentially poor healing due to high-dose pelvic radiation, including intraoperative radiation.\r"

We hypothesized that the use of self-contained infusion pumps using fluids maintained in a closed system would permit safe peripheral IV administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and possibly other hormones, over prolonged intervals. Thirty-eight female patients undergoing pulsatile IV gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy were followed for 1958 catheter days (230 catheters). Catheters were removed for signs of local inflammation, at the completion of a treatment episode or, initially, at routine intervals of 7-10 days. There were no episodes of fever (temperature over 37.5C) and three episodes of local inflammation. The incidence of significant catheter-tip cultures was 11%, and none were associated with local inflammation. There were four positive blood cultures (2%), none associated with local or systemic signs of infection. We conclude that the use of a closed system of prolonged peripheral IV cannulation is relatively safe when combined with fastidious care of the catheter site and careful outpatient monitoring for long-term administration of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone.\r"

The purpose of this project was to evaluate the ability of a commercially available Doppler system, the Toitu Fetal Actocardiograph MT-320, to detect and discriminate various fetal activities during routine antepartum FHR testing. Simultaneous visualization with real-time ultrasound allowed correlation of isolated and complex fetal activities with the processed actograph signals. This apparatus was able to detect 95.9% of all major fetal movements observed, 94.3% of isolated fetal movements, 95.6% of isolated spinal flexion-extension, 97.1% of isolated rolling movements, and 100% of all multiple (P less than .001) fetal movements. Based on the amplitude (P less than .0001) and duration of the isolated actograph signals, it was possible to discriminate among fetal limb movements (mean amplitude 87.3 units, mean duration less than 2.0 seconds), spinal flexion-extension movements (66.3 units, 14.8 seconds), and rolling movements (43.8 units, 22.1 seconds). The routine detection of fetal breathing, hand movements, and rapid eye movements appears to be beyond the sensitivity of this particular apparatus. The ability to evaluate fetal activity reliably may be clinically useful during routine antepartum FHR testing.\r"

The diagnosis of endometriosis should only be made at the time of laparoscopy or laparotomy and should be confirmed with biopsy if possible. Once the diagnosis is made, it should be classified according to the revised AFS system. The treatment of infertility associated with endometriosis is controversial and usually consists of either medical therapy with hormonal manipulation designed to suppress the disease, surgical therapy designed to debulk the disease and repair anatomic distortion, or a combination of both. Despite an abundance of research on the treatment of endometriosis, the pregnancy rate for patients with endometriosis remains lower than that of the normal population. The reasons for this are obscure. Endometriosis does not respond to hormonal changes the same way that normal endometrium does and has been shown to persist despite extensive medical therapy. The recurrence rate of the disease is impressively high after either medical or surgical therapy. Interestingly, expectant management of minimal or mild disease is associated with pregnancy rates equal to those of any other type of therapy. Only when the disease is more extensive does aggressive treatment appear to show improvement in pregnancy rates. Whether combination therapy of endometriosis is better than single agent therapy remains open to debate. Some of the best-designed studies using combination therapy have shown no difference in pregnancy rates. Yet, when taken as a whole, it would appear that if combination medical and surgical therapy is chosen, the medical therapy should be given preoperatively. The literature abounds with a wide variety of classification systems, methods of calculating pregnancy rates, and inclusion of control groups. Because of this disparity between studies, reliable conclusions cannot be drawn.\r"

  ".W": "In the context of the pathophysiology of endometriosis, the technology of IVF-ET and GIFT appears to offer a promising alternative for infertility associated with endometriosis in situations refractory to conventional medical or surgical therapy. The success rate of IVF with respect to follicular response, oocyte recovery, fertilization rate, and pregnancy rate in mild-to-moderate (stages I to II) disease is comparable to patients with tubal disease. However, compromise of oocyte recovery and fertilization appears to be present in severe-extensive cases (stages III to IV) implying an impairment of reproductive potential in advanced disease. In all stages of endometriosis, prior therapy, either medical or surgical, offers the best prognosis for an IVF or GIFT attempt. Surgical therapy with operative endoscopy at the time of oocyte retrieval offers a reasonable prognosis for treatment-independent pregnancy in cases of active endometriosis. The GIFT procedure bypasses an unfavorable peritoneal environment in stages I to II endometriosis without anatomic distortion or compromise of fallopian tube function. Pretreatment with GnRH analogues prior to ovulation induction is valuable in suppression of active disease as well as in inducing improved homogeneity of follicular response in IVF or GIFT cycles.\r"

Adenomyosis is most frequent in parous women in their middle to late forties. There is a high frequency of associated pathology, including leiomyomas, endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia, and carcinoma. This relationship may suggest a common underlying disorder, such as hyperestrogenemia. Adenomyosis is a frequent finding in pregnancy, and obstetric or surgical complications are rare. Approximately 30 to 50 per cent of adenomyotic foci respond to progesterone, particularly to the high serum levels in pregnancy. The preoperative diagnosis of adenomyosis remains poor. Radiologic procedures and serum levels of CA-125 are of limited diagnostic value. Only a high degree of clinical suspicion will aid in the diagnosis of this histopathologic entity. Hysterectomy remains the mainstay of treatment and diagnosis.\r"

The serum test has low sensitivity and would not be appropriate for general screening purposes, but in clinical situations that have a relatively high prevalence of endometriosis, CA-125 determinations have acceptable sensitivities and very high specificities. The concentrations of CA-125 correlate with both the severity and the clinical course of the disease. In women with diagnosed endometriosis, use of serial CA-125 determinations to monitor the course of the disease shows much promise in early studies. The changes in the CA-125 levels can offer additional information to the clinician about the status of the endometriosis, but how much this information will assist in the management and improve the outcome of treatment must await the results of prospective studies.\r"

  ".W": "Endometriosis is one of the most common conditions encountered in gynecology and the field of infertility. The clinical presentation depends on the location and the extent of disease, but the severity of symptoms does not correlate directly with the extent of disease. Symptoms of genital endometriosis may be categorized as menstrual dysfunction, ovulatory dysfunction, and reproductive dysfunction. With menstrual dysfunction, the frequent clinical symptoms are cyclic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia. Endometriosis is commonly found to be the cause in younger patients with pain and dysmenorrhea, particularly when the clinician is aware of the appearance of atypical lesions. Types of ovulatory dysfunction reported to be associated with endometriosis include anovulation, premenstrual spotting, luteal phase defects, and LUF syndrome. The data are not sufficient to determine the prevalence of endometriosis, luteal phase defects, and hyperprolactinemia. With LUF syndrome, there are data to support an association, but more data on the frequency of LUF in consecutive normal cycles compared to consecutive cycles in women with endometriosis would be beneficial. A higher rate of infertility is reported in couples with endometriosis. Two approaches are used to evaluate spontaneous abortions and endometriosis. In retrospective studies, the abortion rates are higher in couples with endometriosis; however, when the pregnancy outcomes in untreated couples are studied, there is less evidence to support the association of a higher spontaneous abortion rate. Formerly, the diagnosis of endometriosis depended on the appearance of typical lesions. With the recognition of early or atypical lesions the histologic confirmation of glands and stroma is assuming a more prominent role. Noninvasive techniques such as assays of endometrial antibodies or CA-125 have certain limitations in terms of producing false-positive results and lacking predictability in early stages of disease. Ultrasonography and MRI give additional and confirmatory information. Most noninvasive techniques are ancillary in diagnosis and management. It still needs to be determined whether their routine use will give enough added information to justify their cost. Currently, the diagnosis of endometriosis is best made by histologic evidence of glands and stroma.\r"

  ".W": "The classification of endometriosis has evolved during this century under the influence of many factors. Although classifications initially paralleled the staging of pelvic malignancies, more modern systems follow the natural progression of this pathologic process. The diagnosis of endometriosis at earlier stages has been limited by the technology of the era. Previously, only patients with more severe disease or symptoms were evaluated and treated. Earlier therapies were more radical and centered on pain relief achieved with removal of the internal genitalia. The objectives of classification were to provide standardized documentation of the disease and--it was hoped--define those patients amenable to less radical therapy. As our diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities grew, so did our interest in infertile women with endometriosis and the treatment of such patients. The diagnosis of endometriosis was often made at an earlier stage of involvement, and therapy stressed repair rather than removal. Description of pelvic involvement, has become more detailed and accurate, and the stage of disease has become prognostic of future fertility. The basic tenet of the R-AFS classification system is to provide an objective and universal method for describing the severity of disease visualized at laparotomy or laparoscopy. Stage of disease will aid the physician in choosing the therapy most suited for the individual patient. If reparative surgery is undertaken, the stage of disease will reflect the extent of pelvic reconstruction required. Quantifying disease severity will, it is hoped, make it predictive of success in conception and prognostic of the need for future medical or surgical treatment. It will also serve to stratify patients with a similar degree and distribution of disease into somewhat homogeneous groups. This will permit reasonable comparisons of effectiveness of different therapies and investigators' methods. Refinement of this type of classification scheme will depend on critical analysis of the system's prognostic capabilities. Further studies will help elucidate the relative importance of individual variables on the potential for success in achieving pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Corneal edema from congenital glaucoma is a rare indication for penetrating keratoplasty. We report the complications and problems associated with eight consecutive penetrating keratoplasties performed in adult eyes with a history of congenital glaucoma. Only 25% of the eyes achieved 20/40 or better vision after surgery. These generally poor results can be attributed to previous glaucomatous optic nerve damage, to complications related to previous surgery, and possibly to amblyopia. The most common surgical complication was postoperative elevation of intraocular pressure, which occurred in all the cases (8/8 eyes), and required permanent augmentation of glaucoma medications in seven eyes (88%), and glaucoma surgery in four eyes (50%). Two eyes (25%) developed corneal graft failure, one from immune rejection and the other from severe postoperative glaucoma necessitating cyclocryotherapy. In view of these complications and the multiple impediments to good postoperative vision, we advise that penetrating keratoplasty be reserved for patients with severe visual disability whose preoperative glaucoma is well controlled.\r"

The primary outcome evaluated in the 60 patients within each group was keratometric astigmatism. A decreasing trend in astigmatism over postoperative year 1 was observed only in the IR group (from 4.00 diopters [D] at 3 months to 2.50 D at 12 months). The difference in median astigmatism at 1 year (IR, 2.50 D; DR, 4.00 D) approached statistical significance (P = 0.06, Mann-Whitney U test). Both groups showed comparable steepening of almost 1 D during postoperative year 1. Assessment of the rate of visual rehabilitation was limited by a greater proportion of IR patients showing cystoid macular edema (CME) after surgery. These results, while favorable toward the IR/selective suture removal technique, must be substantiated by a final assessment after all sutures have been removed.\r"

The most commonly used is active rhinomanometry, and relatively recent standardization has led to the popularization of the anterior method. Posterior active and passive rhinomanometry are also available; other methods include plethysmography, peak expiratory flow rate, rhinohygrometry, thermography, oscillometry, echorhinometry, audiometric rhinomanometry, and rhinostereometry. A reliable technique would have many applications, particularly in pre- and post-therapeutic evaluation. At present, however, no method enjoys routine clinical usage, although there is considerable interest in future development.\r"

  ".W": "Human pain responsivity was defined as the subject's behavioral pain endurance time (PET) to the 1 +/- 0.3 degrees C cold-pressor test, a naturalistic and clinical analogue tonic pain model. Over the past 2 years, we have consistently observed a behavioral dichotomy of pain responsivity in each of our 6 studies (all at P less than 0.000001 effect level), totaling 205 subjects. Overall, the pain-tolerant (PT) subjects could endure the whole 5 min (note that 3 min was the ceiling criterion in the last study) of cold-pressor test, while the pain-sensitive (PS) subjects could merely tolerate the test for an overall mean of 60 sec, 20% of PET in the PT group. No overlapping of distribution was observed between these 2 populations. Further, we observed that the percentage of subjects in each of these 2 groups varied substantially across studies. The mean pain perception (Visual Analogue Scale) of tonic pain ranged from 60-70 for both aversiveness and intensity scales. The characteristics of this tonic pain, assessed by the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), showed similar patterns across each study with a high degree of consistency. Although ratings of pain aversiveness did not differ in the PT vs. PS subjects, ratings of pain intensity did differ, with the PT subject reporting less pain. It was found that state anxiety correlated with MPQ scores for PS, but not PT, subjects. Additionally, psychological tests (Tellegen Absorbance Scale, Kleinknecht Fear, Spielberger Trait-Anxiety) were positively correlated with certain MPQ measures for PS, but not PT subjects. Multivariate regression analyses indicated, in the PS but not the PT group, that 36% of variance in pain score (MPQ-T) could be predicted by the psychological trait factors. The general level of fear contributed singularly as the major predictor variable in the pain-sensitive individuals. We consider this tonic pain model indeed offers a succinct empirical paradigm to study human pain responsivity in general. The psychological/physiological etiology of such drastic human pain responsivity requires intense systematic investigations. This report discusses the results in: (a) individual differences in pain responsivity, (b) characterization of the cold-pressor test as a model for tonic pain, (c) contrast between PS and PT groups of pain perception and state anxiety, and (d) psychological determinants of measures for cognitive, perceptual and affective domains. Discussion was also focused on the experimental tonic pain model and its generality for clinical pain, as well as the basic model of the cold-pressor test for human tonic pain responsivity.\r"

No analgesia was observed after either drug, at doses high enough to produce frequent central nervous system side effects.

The majority of cells recorded in rats with inflamed limbs demonstrated properties uncharacteristic of this cell population in control rats, including large receptive fields, discontinuous receptive fields, responsiveness to deep as well as cutaneous tissues and ongoing or bursting spontaneous activity. Cells with complex receptive fields were encountered from less than 6 h to 5 days after induction of inflammation. This time course correlates with the occurrence of hyperalgesia to thermal stimuli. The contributions of nociceptive afferent sensitization and alterations in the physical environment of peripheral receptors to the observed enlargement of receptive fields were examined by testing the responses of cells to localized electrical and thermal stimuli in the absence and presence of local anesthesia. Nociceptive primary afferents did not demonstrate enlarged receptive fields in this model of inflammation. The results imply that the enlargement of receptive fields cannot be accounted for by peripheral sensitization of peripheral nociceptors or physical changes in the environment of peripheral receptors and must therefore involve changes within the central nervous system.\r"

Fourteen patients with normal baseline serum creatinine concentrations received an aminoglycoside postoperatively. These children received CyA and an aminoglycoside for 249 days (average, 17.8 days/patient). Forty of the 249 days included treatment with vancomycin or amphotericin B. Twelve children (86%) showed no evidence of renal dysfunction after aminoglycoside therapy. Two children developed renal dysfunction and eventually succumbed. In neither case could aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity be identified as the main cause of renal dysfunction. Multiple other factors, including ischemia and high CyA concentrations, probably contributed to renal deterioration. We conclude that aminoglycosides can be used safely in children receiving CyA following liver transplantation, provided serum CyA concentrations are followed closely and other risk factors for renal dysfunction are minimized.\r"

A review of nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates from our institution from January, 1981, through March, 1988, was undertaken to assess the role of age and specific serovar on the incidence of bacteremia. Two hundred twenty isolates were identified: one cerebrospinal fluid, 14 blood and 205 stool. The mean age of patients with bacteremia was 182 months, not significantly different from the mean age of 142 months for patients with stool isolates. Salmonella weltevreden was the most frequent isolate accounting for 23% of all isolates and all isolates of this organism were from stool cultures. Patients with S. weltevreden infections had mean and median ages of 50 and 2.5 months and were younger than patients with stool isolates from other serovars who had mean and median ages of 174 and 38 months. Infants younger than 3 or 6 months of age with positive stool cultures in whom blood cultures were obtained did not demonstrate a higher incidence of bacteremia than did older patients. We conclude that the incidence of bacteremia in patients with nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis is highly related to the invasiveness of the infecting specific Salmonella serovar.\r"

To test this hypothesis, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety (STAI) scores and 24-hour urinary catecholamine collections were gathered from 11 children and adolescents without mitral valve prolapse, 6 with asymptomatic mitral valve prolapse, and 14 who had chest pain (some with additional symptoms of shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue). STAI scores and catecholamine excretion values were not significantly different between groups. Ten symptomatic patients were randomly assigned to either eight sessions of skin temperature biofeedback with daily home practice of relaxation-mental imagery techniques or an attention-placebo condition. Change in 24-hour urinary catecholamine excretion values and STAI scores from baseline to end of treatment did not differ significantly between treatment and placebo conditions. Although not evident at the end of treatment, a significant decrease in chest pain was found in the biofeedback group at 6-month follow-up evaluation. In summary, results of this study did not show evidence of increased sympathetic tone or levels of anxiety in symptomatic pediatric patients with mitral valve prolapse. A behavioral treatment program using biofeedback and relaxation-mental imagery techniques was associated with decreased chest pain at 6-month follow-up.\r"

In this study a convenience sample of 10 pregnant women, 16 nonpregnant women, and 18 men were studied to determine if changes in plasma beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity affected pain perception during labor. Pregnant women had plasma levels of beta-endorphin significantly higher than nonpregnant women at the midpoint of their menstrual cycle, t = 3.74, df = 31, p = .007. Self-reported pain perception scores were not correlated with plasma beta-endorphin levels. However, as labor progressed, the women reported increased discomfort between contractions and during contractions while beta-endorphin levels increased only slightly. Close examination of the pain pattern indicates that pain perceived by the women between contractions increased at a greater rate than during contractions. This pattern suggests that opiate-active beta-endorphin may increase the ability of women to tolerate acute pain.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolic actions of insulin and anti-insulin receptor monoclonal antibodies were compared with their effects on insulin receptor phosphorylation in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with human insulin receptor cDNA. In serum-starved NIH 3T3 HIR3.5 cells, uptake of 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose was stimulated up to 2-fold after 30 min with insulin, with a half-maximal effect at 0.1 nM insulin. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was stimulated approximately 12-fold after a 16-hr preincubation with insulin, with a half-maximal effect at 2 nM insulin. Phosphorylation of insulin receptor beta-subunit in cells prelabeled with [32P]phosphate was increased 10- to 20-fold within 5 min of adding insulin, with a half-maximal effect at approximately 3 nM insulin. Monoclonal antibodies reacting with four different epitopes on the insulin receptor mimicked the effect of insulin on 2-deoxyglucose uptake. These antibodies also stimulated thymidine incorporation, although the maximum stimulation was only approximately 30% that of insulin. Two antibodies (25-49 and 83-14) showed a similar concentration dependence to insulin in their metabolic effects and in the inhibition of 125I-labeled insulin binding to cells. The other two antibodies (83-7 and 18-44) were somewhat less potent and did not inhibit insulin binding. None of the antibodies significantly increased insulin receptor phosphorylation at concentrations up to 100 nM, which at least in the case of 25-49 and 83-14 was sufficient for full receptor occupancy. It is concluded that the insulin-like metabolic effects of antibodies involve a mechanism of receptor activation that is independent of autophosphorylation and hence that receptor autophosphorylation is not an essential step in triggering at least some events in the insulin signaling pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5N-formamidopyrimidine (Fapy)-DNA glycosylase of Escherichia coli, which is coded for by the fpg gene, excises purine bases with ring-opened imidazoles. In addition to the DNA glycosylase activity, we report that the Fapy-DNA glycosylase of E. coli has an associated activity, resistant to EDTA, that nicks DNA at apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. The levels of Fapy-DNA glycosylase and AP-nicking activity were parallel in crude lysates of E. coli HB101 harboring different plasmids constructed from the fpg gene. The fpg gene is different from the xth, nth, and nfo genes of E. coli, whose gene products also cleave DNA at AP sites. The Fapy-DNA glycosylase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. During this purification, the Fapy-DNA glycosylase copurified with an AP-nicking activity using chromatographic separations based on ion-exchange, molecular weight exclusion, and hydrophobicity. The cleavage at AP sites by the Fapy-DNA glycosylase left a 5'-phosphomonoester nucleotide at one terminus. In addition, DNA containing reduced AP sites was not nicked by the Fapy-DNA glycosylase. These data suggest that the mechanism of cleavage involved beta elimination. Therefore, this activity of the Fapy-DNA glycosylase nicking DNA at AP sites should be referred to as an AP lyase. The 3' terminus did not prime nick-translation by E. coli DNA polymerase I. However, the 3' terminus becomes a substrate for nick-translation if first allowed to react with calf intestine phosphatase or the E. coli exonuclease III. These data suggest that the repair of the Fapy lesion at least to some extent results in the formation of both 5'- and 3'-phosphomonoester nucleotides and the release of the deoxyribose.\r"

  ".W": "Photoreactive derivatives of yeast tRNA(Phe) containing 2-azidoadenosine (2N3A) at position 73 or 76 have been crosslinked to the peptidyl site of Escherichia coli ribosomes. Covalent tRNA-ribosome attachment was dependent upon the replacement of adenosine by 2N3A in the tRNA, irradiation with 300-nm light, and the presence of poly(U). In all cases, the modified tRNAs became crosslinked exclusively to 50S ribosomal subunits. While the tRNA derivative containing 2N3A at position 73 labeled only protein L27, that containing 2N3A at position 76 labeled proteins L15, L16, and L27 as well as a segment of the 23S rRNA. The site of crosslinking in the rRNA was identified as guanosine-1945, which lies within a highly conserved sequence adjacent to a number of modified bases and has not until now been identified at the peptidyltransferase center. On the basis of these results, and previously reported crosslinks from tRNA containing 8-azidoadenosine in the 3'-terminal -A-C-C-A sequence [Wower, J., Hixson, S. S. & Zimmermann, R. A. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 8114-8121], we propose a model for the arrangement of tRNA molecules at the peptidyl and aminoacyl sites that is consistent with most of the information available about the location of the peptidyltransferase center and the decoding domain of the E. coli ribosome.\r"

When the purified gene products--the UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins--are mixed together, an excision nuclease is formed that incises on both sides of the damaged nucleotide in an ATP-dependent reaction; it has been presumed that the excision nuclease was an ABC complex containing all three Uvr proteins. To determine the stoichiometry of the subunits in the enzyme, we conducted hydrodynamic studies with mixtures of the subunits with or without DNA substrate. We found that without DNA the UvrA subunit is a dimer and that when UvrB protein is also present, a (UvrA)2(UvrB)1 complex forms. Without DNA no detectable interaction of either the UvrA or UvrB subunits or the (UvrA)2(UvrB)1 complex with the UvrC subunit occurs. Unexpectedly, with UV-irradiated DNA, the UvrA/UvrB ratio in isolated DNA-protein complexes is variable, and the ratio becomes infinitesimally low as the UvrA concentration in the reaction mixture decreases. Under conditions of saturating UvrB protein approximately one UvrB molecule binds to DNA per damaged site in a reaction that requires catalytic amounts of UvrA subunit. Addition of UvrC protein to purified UvrB-DNA complexes results in rapid incision of the DNA, presumably catalyzed by an excision nuclease containing only UvrB and UvrC subunits.\r"

We show that this conformational switch occurs in an all-or-none highly cooperative fashion (Hill coefficient = 4). Analysis of the subunit composition of ACE1 bound to DNA indicates that cooperativity results from the binding of multiple Cu(I) ions to the cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain. Surprisingly, DNA has little effect on the interaction between Cu(I) and ACE1 as assayed by partial proteolysis; this suggests that the effect of the metal on DNA binding is primarily kinetic rather than thermodynamic. Although Ag(I) also activates ACE1, it acts less cooperatively than the smaller Cu(I) ion and the resulting metalloprotein has a reduced affinity for DNA. The cooperative interaction between Cu and ACE1 allows the cell to respond to a small change in metal concentration by a large change in gene expression.\r"

This activity was purified to near, if not complete, homogeneity as judged by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We have tentatively named this protein calf thymus strand-transfer protein 1 (CTST1). The apparent molecular mass of the protein was 35 kDa by gel electrophoresis. Its sedimentation coefficient was approximately 1.5 S in glycerol gradient centrifugation. These values led us to examine the possibility that CTST1 is histone H1. Western blot analysis of CTST1 with anti-rat liver histone H1 antiserum showed that CTST1 crossreacts with the serum, indicating that CTST1 is histone H1. The mobility of CTST1 was identical to one of the subtypes of calf thymus histone H1 by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel and acetic acid/urea/polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses. We have also confirmed the above conclusion by showing that calf thymus histone H1 has a strand-transfer activity with a specific activity comparable to that of CTST1. The reaction required homologous substrates, but neither Mg2+ nor ATP. The reaction also required stoichiometric amounts of protein. The purified CTST1 fraction lacked detectable exo- and endonuclease activities and also lacked a DNA helicase activity.\r"

In contrast, the cytoplasmic protein beta-galactosidase was not found in association with SecB. Pulse-chase analysis showed that the SecB-precursor MBP complex was short lived, as expected for a complex that represents an intermediate in the protein-export pathway.

Here we characterize the ends of the transposon, its target-site requirements, and the products of transposition into the B. fragilis chromosome and two sets of B. fragilis-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors. With the exception of an additional cytosine residue in the left end, there are perfect 13-base-pair (bp) inverted repeats at the ends of Tn4399. Insertion of Tn4399 resulted in a 3-bp target-site repeat in 8 out of 12 independent transpositions and showed a high insertion-site specificity. A remarkable feature of Tn4399 insertions is the presence of an additional 5 bp located between the right inverted repeat and the target-site repeat. Four sequence variations of the 5 bp were found, with absolute conservation at positions 1, 2, and 5. Only two of the variations were present in junction fragments of all three copies of Tn4399 contained in the chromosome of the original donor strain, B. fragilis TM4.2321. Tn4399 appears to represent a new type of conjugal transposon. In contrast to Tn916 and Tn1545, described in streptococci, Tn4399 creates a target-site repeat and contains an additional 5 bp at the right end only, between the transposon and the target sequence. In addition, Tn4399 can mobilize plasmids in cis.\r"
