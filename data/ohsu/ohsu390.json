Nutrient analysis of food records, collected at 0, 6, and 12 mo, was compared with changes observed in lipid profiles and with chemical analysis of duplicate diets. Both food records and duplicate meals showed a significant decrease in fat intake (from 36 to 23% of total calories, p less than 0.0001) and a significant increase in carbohydrate (from 43 to 56% of total calories, p less than 0.0001) in the intervention group. The calculated nutrient intake from food records tended to overestimate the intake of protein, fat, and carbohydrate compared with the chemically analyzed method. The mean level of plasma cholesterol in the intervention group was significantly reduced (7.3%, p less than 0.01) in the first 6 mo after a reduction in dietary fat but the levels observed did not differ significantly between the groups at any time.\r"

Fasting plasma Zn concentrations decreased significantly as pregnancy progressed. Late-pregnant women had significantly higher erythrocyte Zn levels and greater 24-h urinary Zn and glucose excretions. Erythrocyte Zn responses to glucose loading were unaffected by gestational age. Plasma Zn after a glucose load in nonpregnant women exhibited a curvilinear response whereas pregnant women showed no change. This lack of response by pregnant women may be related to their lower plasma Zn concentrations. Plasma Zn in pregnant women may not be as readily available to assist in glucose utilization.\r"

Urine samples were vacuum distilled, water was reduced to hydrogen gas, and deuterium enrichment was measured by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Milk intake was measured throughout the elimination period from prefeeding and postfeeding bottle weights (n = 12) or volumes (n = 4). Without corrections for atmospheric water influx, milk intake was overestimated by 76 g/d (6%). With corrections for estimated metabolic water production, isotopic fractionation, and atmospheric water influx, deuterium measured 98% +/- 3% or 1300 g milk intake/d compared with actual milk intake of 1329 +/- 206 g/d.\r"

Both vegetarian dietary and lifestyle practices are involved. Data are strong that vegetarians are at lesser risk for obesity, atonic constipation, lung cancer, and alcoholism. Evidence is good that risks for hypertension, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes, and gallstones are lower. Data are only fair to poor that risks of breast cancer, diverticular disease of the colon, colonic cancer, calcium kidney stones, osteoporosis, dental erosion, and dental caries are lower among vegetarians. Reduced risks for chronic degenerative diseases can also be achieved by manipulations of omnivorous diets and lifestyles.\r"

Athletes in heavy training are urged to consume 70% of calories as CHO to maximize body CHO stores. A deemphasis in animal products with an emphasis in high-CHO plant foods would facilitate athletes in conforming to nutritional recommendations. Some female athletes may increase their risk of iron deficiency and/or amenorrhea if a restrictive vegetarian diet is adopted. In general, the high-CHO nature of the vegetarian diet can help the endurance athlete in heavy training maximize body glycogen stores and thus the ability to perform. The balanced vegetarian diet provides the athlete with added reduction in coronary risk factors while meeting all known nutritional needs.\r"

Animal studies show that colonic cell proliferation is stimulated by feeding in general and specifically by a number of dietary fibers, fats, bile acids, and short-chain fatty acids. Many of these growth factors also increase the induction of experimental tumorigenesis. On the other hand factors that reduce cell growth, including ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxyanisole, inhibit colon carcinogenesis. These results support the concept that dietary chemoprevention is feasible and could significantly reduce the rate of colon cancer development in high risk populations.\r"

After a high-fat meal the increase in plasma CCK was similar in lean and obese women.

Seventh-day Adventist vegetarians showed significantly less hypertension and lower blood pressures compared with Mormon omnivores, effects which were independent of differences in obesity and not due to altered sodium intake. Subsequently, controlled dietary intervention studies in healthy normotensive omnivores provided more direct evidence for a blood pressure-lowering effect of a lactoovovegetarian diet with reversible changes of 5-6 mm Hg systolic and 2-3 mm Hg diastolic occurring over 6-wk periods. Similar dietary effects in mild hypertensive subjects provides impetus for identifying the responsible nutrients.\r"

The risk relationships of this ratio may differ in different populations. There is a certain amount of evidence that vegetarians may have lower blood pressures but this is not clearly supported by data from Seventh-day Adventists.

The bioavailability of vitamin B-6 from animal products is quite high, reaching 100% for many foods. In general the bioavailability from plant foods is lower. The presence of fiber reduces the bioavailability by 5-10% whereas the presence of pyridoxine glucoside reduces the bioavailability by 75-80%. This glucoside is found in a variety of plant foods, with the highest content occurring in the crucifers. The percent of total vitamin B-6 that exists as the glucoside has been suggested to be the best indicator of bioavailability. Data from Nepalese vegetarian lactating women suggest that the low vitamin B-6 status of these mothers and their infants, as determined by their concentrations of plasma pyridoxal phosphate, may be adversely affected by the dietary intake of the naturally occurring pyridoxine glucoside.\r"

Explanations for inadequate growth include deficiencies of energy, calcium, zinc and vitamins B-12 and D. Due to decreased bioavailability, amino acids and nitrogen in vegan diets may be inadequate to support normal growth. Bioavailability of amino acids and nitrogen may be decreased by dietary fiber, food processing and storage, inadequate energy, and other unknown factors. Bioavailability should be considered when evaluating adequacy of intakes of protein, amino acids and nitrogen from vegan diets by infants and children.\r"

The evidence presented for the scientific rationale is based on the 1982 National Academy of Sciences Committee report Diet, Nutrition and Cancer and NCI's own scientific reviews that link long-term dietary patterns with cancer risk. These guidelines to the American public are consistent with other dietary recommendations from the US departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, the American Cancer Society, and the American Heart Association.\r"

Two hundred selected cases of primary breast carcinoma were assayed for estrogen receptor content by biochemical and immunohistochemical procedures. Quantitative evaluation was by biochemical, immunohistochemical, and automated computer-assisted image analysis using the Cell Analysis System's CAS/100 machine (Lombard, IL). Quantitative estrogen receptor content was determined by dextran-coated charcoal analysis and sucrose density gradient analysis. Immunohistochemical evaluation incorporated both intensity and distribution of staining, yielding a subjective score, histologic score (HSCORE). An objective quantitation, also incorporating intensity and distribution of staining, was done by computer-assisted image analysis, quantitative immunocytochemical score (QIC SCORE). HSCORE analysis was done with and without methyl green counterstain with no loss of sensitivity. Comparison of QIC SCORE with the biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of the tissues examined revealed excellent sensitivities and specificities. These data suggest that automated image analysis provides an effective qualitative and quantitative means of evaluating estrogen receptor content in human breast cancers.\r"

  ".W": "The concomitant presence of B antigens and of the antigen recognized by the monoclonal antibody Leu-M5 (CD11c) on neoplastic lymphoid cells has been reported to be largely restricted to hairy cell leukemia (HCL). The authors studied Leu-M5 reactivity of neoplastic cells from 59 patients whose specimens were referred with a stated diagnosis of HCL by using the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique on peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) specimens. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (AcP-T) activity was also studied. In 49 patients, HCL had been confirmed previously by BM biopsy, and specimens were evaluated for disease status during or after therapy with interferon (IFN) or 2'-deoxycoformycin. The remaining ten patients were newly referred for confirmation of the diagnosis of HCL before therapy. In all 55 patients in whom the BM biopsy demonstrated HCL, virtually every leukemic cell was Leu-M5 reactive, and the reaction proved, in some cases, to be helpful in the detection of small numbers of hairy cells in PB or BM preparations. AcP-T reactivity was demonstrated in the neoplastic cells of 52 of these 55 patients, including all but 3 of those receiving IFN, and was helpful in confirming persistent leukemia when interpretation of BM biopsy sections was difficult because the numbers of hairy cells were small. However, in four of the ten newly referred patients, BM biopsy showed features of splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, rather than HCL. The neoplastic cells of these four patients were of B-cell origin and in three were Leu-M5 reactive. The authors' study indicates that Leu-M5 is present in nearly all hairy cells, but its presence in conjunction with other B-cell markers is not specific for HCL.\r"

Each has its apparent advantages, yet each also has certain limitations. Admittedly, a comprehensive review of these different methods is beyond the scope of this forum, and several immunohistochemical techniques in current use will not be discussed in detail. Still, the principles of horseradish peroxidase-linked procedures, as described in this review, form the foundation of contemporary diagnostic immunohistology. They provide not only a powerful method of antigen detection, but also a model with which to compare recent and future innovations.\r"

The epithelial cells were initially harvested from a fresh operative specimen by gentle scraping and digestion with 1% collagenase on ice. Cells were then washed, evaluated for viability, and polytron homogenized. After immunization and subsequent fusion, hybridoma cell lines producing distinct antibody-binding patterns were identified by indirect immunoepifluorescence (IIEF). Wells representing distinct patterns were subcloned and carried to limiting dilution. Of the multiple hybridomas studied, the predominant target antibodies were goblet cell and glycoprotein-like molecules. Patterns of antibody binding identified by IIEF included: brush border, goblet cell, surface glycoprotein, enterocyte membranes, basilar crypt inclusions, circumferential goblet cell, and a heterogeneous goblet cell glycoprotein pattern. Molecular weight determination and cross-reactivity with various human tissues were studied by immunoblotting following sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Several hybridomas were specific for the intestine but were not specific for Crohn's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension in chronic renal failure is usually due to excessive accumulation of salt and water. In some cases, sodium and volume depletion by dialysis fail to reduce the high BP, and plasma renin activity tends to be higher. We performed a semiquantitative analysis of the immunohistochemical distribution of renin in the kidneys of ten patients with end-stage renal disease and hypertension using a specific antihuman renin antibody and a peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique on paraffin sections of nephrectomy and/or autopsy specimens. In five cases with severe, dialysis-resistant hypertension, the degree of immunoreactivity was most striking, exceeding that found in renovascular hypertension and present in arterioles at a distance from the glomeruli. Three cases of advanced diabetic glomerulosclerosis consistently showed minimal immunoreactivity. We conclude that renin often can be detected immunologically in the kidney of patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension, but its pathophysiological role will require further study.\r"

All 19 patients underwent a biopsy of the transplant allograft. Biopsy results included acute cellular rejection, acute vascular rejection, chronic vascular rejection (CVR), and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Recipients of cadaveric renal allografts with normal function served as controls. The control showed distinct corticomedullary demarcation (CMD) on T1-weighted imaging. In contrast, CMD was absent or diminished in all the patients with suspected allograft rejection. Unfortunately, the loss of CMD did not correlate with a specific biopsy diagnosis. Patients with biopsy evidence of acute and chronic rejection or ATN demonstrated loss of CMD with similar image patterns. In conclusion, MRI is capable of detecting renal allograft dysfunction, but does not permit the determination of a specific cause.\r"

  ".W": "Thus, in summary, we hypothesize that nephron loss by a time-limited insult (eg, an acute immunological insult, surgical removal of five sixths of normal nephrons) may cause events in the tubules of the remaining nephrons that contribute substantially, though not exclusively, to the inexorable progression to ESRD. Specifically, hypermetabolism in the remaining tubules as assessed by oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis rates has been found to occur. This hypermetabolism in residual nephrons appears to be due to the known increased sodium transport per nephron, but nonsodium transport events also appear to be involved. With respect to the latter phenomenon, we propose that an increase in growth factor response per tubule, as a mechanism of renal hypertrophy, activates the DAG----protein kinase C----Na/H antiporter system. We have evidence in support of this sequence of events by the demonstration of a two-fold increase in membrane (particulate) protein kinase C within 24 hours after removal of the contralateral kidney and an increase in intracellular pH as assessed by NMR spectroscopy. Activation of the Na/H antiporter not only leads to proton extrusion and cellular alkalinization, which may activate cellular alkalinization, which may activate cellular enzymes such as phospholipases, but also increases intracellular Na concentration, thereby further increasing Na/K-ATPase, ATP use, and enhancing ATP synthesis. The increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, which accompanies the enhanced ATP synthesis, would be expected to be associated with increased oxygen radicle generation. If the tissue scavengers of oxygen radicles are not sufficient to scavenge the increase in oxygen radicles, then lipid peroxidation and tissue damage will occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: A collaborative multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous acyclovir treatment of first-episode genital herpes was performed in order to substantiate previous findings on the efficacy and safety of this drug, to evaluate the influence of parenteral therapy on recurrence frequency, and to obtain further data on the natural history of genital herpes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-two patients with first episodes of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to treatment with intravenous acyclovir (5 mg/kg every eight hours) or placebo for five days. Before therapy, all lesions in the genital/perineal area and in extragenital sites were cultured. New lesions appearing in both areas after the onset of therapy were cultured separately. Lesions in all groups were cultured until completely healed. Sera were collected from all patients on entry to the study and on Day 21 to determine presence or absence of antibodies to HSV-1 and HSV-2. Time to healing, time to crusting, time to cessation of viral shedding, and appearance of new lesions during therapy were compared for each treatment group. RESULTS: Patients receiving acyclovir experienced a significant reduction in the median duration of pain (4.3 versus 4.8 days, p = 0.019), viral shedding (1.9 versus 8.4 days, p less than 0.001), and time to healing (8.4 versus 11.5 days, p = 0.02) compared with placebo recipients. These differences were largely attributable to the effect of therapy in the subset of patients with primary disease in whom acyclovir reduced the median duration of pain from 10.6 days to 4.2 days, the median duration of viral shedding from 17.1 days to 1.9 days, and the median time to healing from 14.2 days to 8.3 days. The rate of subsequent recurrence of genital herpes was not altered by acyclovir treatment: 24 of 32 acyclovir recipients (75 percent) experienced one or more recurrences during a mean follow-up of 14 months compared with 19 of 27 placebo recipients (70 percent). Among patients experiencing recurrences, the mean number of recurrences per month among acyclovir recipients was 0.25 compared with 0.19 for patients given placebo. CONCLUSION: This multicenter trial confirms the efficacy of intravenous acyclovir in the management of first-episode genital herpes, especially in patients with primary infection. However, therapy did not alter the frequency of recurrences.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Percutaneously inserted central venous catheters are widely used. Catheter-related bacteremia or fungemia is the most frequent serious complication of these catheters. In an attempt to reduce the frequency of such infections, a subcutaneous cuff constructed of a biodegradable collagen matrix impregnated with bactericidal silver was developed. Our goal was to assess, in a multicenter clinical trial, the effectiveness of this cuff in preventing catheter-related infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Central venous catheters needed for fluid or drug therapy, hemodynamic monitoring, or hyperalimentation in patients in three centers were randomly assigned to be inserted with or without the cuff. Patients and catheters in the two groups were comparable in terms of risk factors predisposing to infection, including colonization of skin about the insertion site. RESULTS: The results with 234 catheters inserted into a new site showed that catheters inserted with the cuff were threefold less likely to be colonized on removal (more than 15 colony-forming units) than were control catheters (28.9 percent versus 9.1 percent, p = 0.002) and were nearly fourfold less likely to produce bacteremia (3.7 percent versus 1.0 percent). Adverse effects from the cuff were not seen. The cuff did not confer protection, however against infection with catheters inserted over a guidewire into old sites. Most of the catheter-related infections identified in this study, including four of the six bacteremias, appear to have been caused by microorganisms colonizing skin about the insertion site, affirming the pathogenetic basis for benefit seen with the cuff in this clinical trial; two may have derived from contamination of the catheter hub. CONCLUSION: This novel, silver-impregnated, attachable cuff can substantially reduce the incidence of catheter-related infection with most percutaneously inserted central venous catheters, can extend the time catheters can be left in place safely, and can prove cost-beneficial.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: A review of the worldwide medical literature was undertaken to determine whether treatment with currently available drugs has been beneficial in patients with glomerulonephritides. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five articles, involving 1,653 adult patients with chronic primary glomerulonephritis with proteinuria and/or nephrotic syndrome, were analyzed. The criteria for inclusion of data were strict, and only complete and well-studied cases were included in the analysis. The papers were grouped into prospective controlled trials, retrospective comparisons of treated and untreated patients, and retrospective studies without an untreated group. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the data shows that patients with minimal change disease clearly benefited from the administration of corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic drugs, since 89 percent and 79 percent of patients had a complete remission in controlled trials and in retrospective studies, respectively. A low incidence of complete and partial remissions was found in the group of patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, proteinuria disappeared in 19 percent, and only 36 percent of these patients had stable renal function after a mean follow-up period of 6.3 years. The incidence of uremia and the number of patients requiring dialysis were very high. In patients with membraneous glomerulonephritis, conflicting results were obtained in controlled trials, retrospective comparisons, and retrospective studies, since a high percentage of complete and partial remissions was present in treated patients from both controlled and retrospective comparisons, whereas the percentage of complete and partial remission in untreated patients increased as the length of the follow-up period increased. Long-term studies carried out on untreated patients confirmed the high percentage of remissions. These data suggest that it is necessary to await future long-term results from controlled trials in order to determine whether or not corticosteroids alone or associated with cytotoxic drugs have a beneficial effect. Finally, the data from patients with mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis show that therapy appears to have no beneficial effect on renal function. Nephrologists need new drugs that interfere more decisively with the immune process in the pathogenesis of primary glomerulonephritis.\r"

We undertook the current study in order to determine the concentrations of different forms of free secretory component (SC) in sera from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The concentrations of SC, S-IgA, and secretory IgM (S-IgM) were quantified in the sera of 100 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and in 77 matched healthy control subjects by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Free SC serum levels exceeded the upper limits of control values in 82 percent of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, S-IgA levels in 88 percent of them, and S-IgM levels in 32 percent. Free SC levels were positively correlated with S-IgA and S-IgM levels. They were weakly correlated with gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, but not with alpha-fetoprotein, beta 2-microglobulin, albumin, or IgA serum concentrations, nor with alkaline phosphatase activity. CONCLUSION: The data clearly demonstrate the elevation of serum free SC concentrations as a novel biologic alteration in hepatocellular carcinoma since free SC levels appear to be correlated neither with tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein, beta 2-microglobulin) nor with biliary obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To our knowledge, clinical studies on the long-term use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with type II diabetes mellitus and nephropathy with incipient renal failure are nonexistent. We therefore assessed the effects of long-term treatment with captopril on systemic and renal hemodynamics and urinary protein excretion in patients with type II diabetes mellitus and the clinical syndrome of diabetic nephropathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients, 10 men and two women, with an average age of 52 years (range, 40 to 66), participated in the study. After the basal hemodynamic evaluation, the patients received captopril in two daily doses. The dosage was adjusted at weekly intervals in order to obtain normalization of blood pressure without exceeding the maximum allowable dosage. Four patients also received furosemide (20 to 40 mg/day). RESULTS: After six months of treatment, the intra-arterial blood pressure fell (from 162 +/- 17/103 +/- 5 to 139 +/- 26/89 +/- 10 mm Hg) due to the reduction in total peripheral vascular resistance index (from 3,720 +/- 658 to 3,190 +/- 762 dynes/second/cm-5/m2), with no change in cardiac index (2.78 +/- 0.36 to 2.79 +/- 0.47 liters/minute/m2). No significant change was seen in renal vascular resistance (from 30,175 +/- 5,371 to 30,173 +/- 5,372 dynes/second/cm-5/1.73 m2) and in filtration fraction (from 26 +/- 8 to 27 +/- 10 percent). A slight, not significant, decrease in renal plasma flow (from 243 +/- 97 to 217 +/- 108 ml/minute/1.73 m2), in glomerular filtration rate (from 57 +/- 17 to 51 +/- 19 ml/minute/1.73 m2), and in proteinuria (from 4.50 +/- 3.10 to 3.40 +/- 2.31 g/day) was also observed. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that captopril is an effective antihypertensive agent in patients with diabetic nephropathy, but the renal beneficial effects seem to be limited when this syndrome is complicated by renal insufficiency.\r"

  ".U": "88324508\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Superactivity of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PP-Rib-P) synthetase, inherited as an X chromosome-linked trait, has been reported in nearly 20 families in which overproduction of uric acid is invariably present in hemizygous affected males. Clinical manifestations of PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity are mainly limited to gout in early adulthood. Neurologic deficits, including sensorineural deafness, have rarely been described. We herein document the association of PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity, gout with excessive uric acid synthesis, and sensorineural deafness in an additional family. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two members of a Spanish family were studied: an eight-year-old boy (Patient 1) with tophaceous gout, purine nucleotide and uric acid overproduction, and sensorineural deafness, and his 27-year-old mother (Patient 2), who had gout. Fibroblast cultures were initiated from skin biopsy specimens, and measurements of PP-Rib-P and purine nucleotide metabolism in the fibroblasts were performed. RESULTS: A labile but superactive PP-Rib-P synthetase was demonstrated in the fibroblasts cultured from both Patients 1 and 2. The kinetic basis of PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity in this family was resistance to purine nucleotide inhibition of enzyme activity. More severe derangements in the enzyme and in PP-Rib-P and purine synthesis in Patient 1's cells than in Patient 2's cells suggest that Patient 1 is hemizygous and Patient 2 is heterozygous for an X chromosome-linked genetic defect. Limited pedigree data support this view. Compared with affected members of seven other families with PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity, these patients are intermediate in the range of clinical expression and in the severity of the enzyme defect as measured by the degree of aberration of PP-Rib-P and purine nucleotide synthesis in fibroblasts. Metabolic abnormalities were more severe in Patient 1's cells than in the cells of most male patients (in whom clinical expression is limited to early adult-onset gout) but were less severe than in the cells of two patients in whom more complex enzyme defects were associated with uric acid overproduction and neurodevelopmental abnormalities (including deafness) in male children and adult women. CONCLUSION: Certain defects resulting in PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity may be causally related to neurologic impairment, most commonly sensorineural deafness.\r"

The condition occurs primarily in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. Current theories on pathogenesis and anatomic correlations are reviewed. Severe, unrelenting otalgia and persistent otorrhea are the symptomatic hallmarks of the disease, whereas an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is the only distinctive laboratory abnormality. Iatrogenic causes such as administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and aural irrigation may play a predisposing role in high-risk populations. The disease can result in cranial polyneuropathies (with facial nerve [VII] paralysis being the most common) and death. The mainstay of treatment is administration of antipseudomonal antibiotics for four to eight weeks. Recurrence is common, and mortality remains at about 20 percent despite antibiotic therapy. Given the increasing longevity of diabetic patients, the frequency of this disease is increasing. Internists, family practitioners, and ambulatory care physicians must now be cognizant of the presenting symptoms, while infectious disease specialists and otolaryngologists need to be appraised of strides in diagnosis and therapy. The role of surgery should be minimized. Use of new diagnostic radiologic modalities and new antipseudomonal antibiotics discussed in this review should lead to improved outcome.\r"

Dystrophin was not demonstrable in undifferentiated myoblasts from control patients and from two patients with DMD. After myoblast fusion, the protein was found in circumscribed sarcoplasmic patches, in the perinuclear area, and along the surface of all normal multinucleate myotubes, with more mature myotubes showing predominantly sarcolemmal distribution. There was no staining in myotubes from one DMD patient and only faint diffuse fluorescence in myotubes from the second affected boy, however. These data provide further evidence that dystrophin is a sarcolemma-associated protein, that it is developmentally regulated, and that it is absent or greatly reduced in quantity in skeletal muscle cultures from patients with DMD.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) exposed to atherogenic levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) for protracted periods demonstrated no measurable evidence of overt cytotoxicity, but were perturbed as indicated by an increase in prostacyclin (PGI2) production. Confluent EC were incubated with high LDL concentrations (240 or 330 mg/dl cholesterol) for 1 to 12 days. LDL was added to culture media containing 25% human lipoprotein-deficient serum to determine the effects of LDL independent of other lipoproteins. LDL did not injure EC as assessed by cell count, vital dye exclusion, 51chromium release, and lactate dehydrogenase release. Although high concentrations of LDL did not cause EC cytotoxicity, such LDL concentrations did results in increased PGI2 generation. PGI2 accumulation in postincubation media was increased two-to-fivefold in otherwise unstimulated cells as measured by radioimmunoassay of the stable PGI2 breakdown product, 6-keto-PGF1-alpha. This elevation persisted for the entire 12-day exposure to high LDL concentrations. These results indicate that prolonged exposure to atherogenic concentrations of LDL does not effect EC viability, but does cause an endothelial perturbation as demonstrated by an increased PGI2 production.\r"

A total of 51 (24 primary) ABO-incompatible (ABO-I) liver grafts were transplanted into 49 recipients. There was a 46% graft failure rate during the first 30 days for primary ABO-I grafts compared with an 11% graft failure rate for primary ABO compatible (ABO-C), crossmatch negative, age, sex and priority-matched control patients (P less than 0.02). A similarly high early graft failure rate (60%) was seen for nonprimary ABO-I grafts during the first 30 days. Clinically, the patients experienced a relentless rise in serum transaminases, hepatic failure, and coagulopathy during the first weeks after transplant. Pathologic examination of ABO-I grafts that failed early demonstrated widespread areas of geographic hemorrhagic necrosis with diffuse intraorgan coagulation. Prominent arterial deposition of antibody and complement components was demonstrated by immunoflourescent staining. Elution studies confirmed the presence of tissue-bound, donor-specific isoagglutinins within the grafts. No such deposition was seen in control cases. These studies confirm that antibody mediated rejection of the liver occurs and allows for the development of criteria for establishing the diagnosis.\r"

One may present an uncontrolled series or use historical or concurrent controls. The prospective, concurrently controlled series is the strongest of the above designs. The randomized clinical trial is the strongest study design and is employed to avoid the errors that are potentially present in non-randomized studies (Chapter 9). It is a prospective, concurrently controlled study design in which subjects are randomly allocated to two or more treatment modalities. The protocol specifies the population source, admission criteria, enactment of the procedure, and outcome determination for the study.\r"

Transfer bias occurs if there is differential loss at followup. The major advantage of a randomized clinical trial is in its attempt to prevent susceptibility bias. Despite the methodologically correct implementation of a study, however, results may not be generalizable due to the particular population, restrictive eligibility criteria, or poor participation.

  ".W": "General anesthesia in combination with surgery is known to result in negative nitrogen balance. To determine whether general anesthesia without concomitant surgery decreases whole body protein synthesis and/or increases whole body protein breakdown, two groups of dogs were studied: Group 1 (n = 6) in the conscious state and Group 2 (n = 8) during general anesthesia employing halothane (1.5 MAC) in 50% nitrous oxide and oxygen. Changes in protein metabolism were estimated by isotope dilution techniques employing simultaneous infusions of [4,53H]leucine and alpha-[1-14C]-ketoisocaproate (KIC). Total leucine carbon flux was unchanged or slightly increased in the anesthetized animals when compared to the conscious controls, indicating only a slight increase in the rate of proteolysis. However, leucine oxidation was increased (P less than 0.001) by more than 80% in the anesthetized animals when compared with their conscious controls, whereas whole body nonoxidative leucine disappearance, an indicator of whole body protein synthesis, was decreased. The ratio of leucine oxidation to the nonoxidative rate of leucine disappearance, which provides an index of the catabolism of at least one essential amino acid in the postabsorptive state, was more than twofold increased (P less than 0.001) in the anesthetized animals regardless of the tracer employed. These studies suggest that the administration of anesthesia alone, without concomitant surgery, is associated with a decreased rate of whole body protein synthesis and increased leucine oxidation, resulting in increased leucine and protein catabolism, which may be underlying or initiating some of the protein wasting known to occur in patients undergoing surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic cough is a fairly common pediatric complaint. Usually, it is secondary to irritation of the airways following a respiratory viral infection. In these cases, the cough tends to diminish over time. There may, however, be a subsequent development of bronchial hyperreactivity. Asthma is common in the pediatric population. From 50% to 90% of chronic coughers may have hyperreactive airways. In the absence of a pulmonary function laboratory to test for this, a trial of bronchodilator therapy is warranted. Other conditions discussed may also cause chronic cough and a thorough history and physical examination with some simple radiologic investigations can help pinpoint the cause. Specific therapy can then be used to manage the problem. In addition to specific therapy, care must be taken to explain to the parents and patient the physiology of the cough and why it is present. Anxieties and fears should be dealt with in a caring and direct manner. Occasionally, non-specific therapy is needed to allow the parents and child some rest and relief.\r"

It may then be possible to determine whether the presence of non-specific bronchial reactivity, as detected by a methacholine response, has potential as a genetic marker. Thirty-one non-asthmatic parent pairs of asthmatic children were selected from asthma (AF) families enrolled in a Natural History of Asthma study. Parent pairs were chosen if both gave negative responses to a modified National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute questionnaire on asthma. The methacholine response of these parents of asthmatic children had a bimodal distribution. These results show that the methacholine response can mark bronchial reactivity without the presence of clinical asthma and that a familial component of bronchial reactivity exists which may be transmitted from one generation to the next.\r"

The immediate onset of neck pain and the presence of posterior midline cervical tenderness each had 100% sensitivity, with specificity of 65% and 48%, respectively. Discharged patients were followed up by telephone or letter at a mean of 25 +/- 20 weeks. Of this group, 63% saw another physician, and 43% had persistent moderate-to-severe neck pain or neurologic symptoms at a mean follow-up time of 24 weeks after injury. Of those who had not had a cervical radiograph while in the ED, 52% later obtained one. In addition, 66% of the discharged patients were pursuing litigation. The results suggest that it may be possible to identify alert patients with cervical spine injury by means of history and examination only; however, a larger study confirming these results is required. The high frequency of post-ED radiography, the high prevalence of persistent symptoms after injury, and frequent involvement in litigation are factors to be considered when evaluating ED patients with post-traumatic neck pain. These factors may support the validity of obtaining cervical spine radiographs on many more of these patients than high-yield criteria would dictate.\r"

The growing experience of the rather grave complications after pancreas transplantation points to the need for consistent use of meticulous techniques during organ procurement and application of workbench procedures just prior to transplantation. In addition, with the further development of the extra-renal transplant programs, the procurement of multiple organs from the same donor is becoming more common and the pancreatic team is more frequently faced with a less than optimal situation in regard to the vascular supply of the pancreatic graft. It, therefore, becomes imperative to carefully evaluate the vasculature and to make the necessary modifications prior to transplantation, since the best surgical techniques will not outweigh the consequences of a suboptimal blood supply, which will compromise the viability of any segment of the delicate pancreaticoduodenal graft.\r"

DESIGN: Survey, outpatients geographically accessible for voluntary participation. SETTING: Bone marrow transplantation referral center. PATIENTS: Fifteen bone marrow graft recipients (13 allogeneic, 2 autologous), out of a total of 33 patients who received transplants at the center and survived more than 6 months after grafting. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In 6 of 15 patients impaired splenic function (functional asplenia) was indicated by the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies in peripheral blood smears, reduced spleen size (P less than 0.001), higher platelet counts (P less than 0.01), higher indium-111 labeled autologous platelet recovery (P less than 0.005), reduced splenic blood flow (P less than 0.001), and reduced accumulation of radioactivity at the splenic site (P less than 0.001). All patients with functional asplenia but only 2 patients without functional asplenia had extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease. The incidence of bacterial infections was four times higher in patients with impaired splenic function. CONCLUSIONS: Functional asplenia is a late complication after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and contributes to the high susceptibility to bacterial infections in patients with extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-two studies (2889 subjects) that investigated the prevalence of the causes of dementia were critically reviewed. Particular attention was paid to potential and actual reversibility. Although dementia manifests itself primarily in old age (particularly age 75 and older), the mean age of patients for the studies that reported age data (56%) was 72.3 years. Twenty-five studies originated from secondary or tertiary centers, and four were community-based. Dementias consisted of Alzheimer disease, 56.8%; multi-infarct, 13.3%; depression, 4.5%; alcoholic, 4.2%; and drugs, 1.5%. No single other cause contributed more than 1.6% of the cases. Potentially reversible causes made up 13.2% of all cases. However, the more important question of whether patients with potentially reversible causes were followed and reversal actually seen was not always examined. In 11 studies (34%) that provided follow-up, 11% of dementias resolved, either partially (8%) or fully (3%). The commonest reversible causes were drugs, 28.2%; depression, 26.2%; and metabolic, 15.5%. Due to the presence of various biases (selection, lack of \"blinded\" investigators, and others) in the surveyed works, it is probable that the true incidence of reversible dementias in the community is even lower than that reported. Research implications as well as a conservative approach to the workup of a new case of dementia are offered.\r"

  ".U": "88325160\r", 
  ".W": "Recent developments in health care are strikingly congruent with a Marxist paradigm. For many years small scale owner producers (physicians) dominated medicine, and the corporate class supported the expansion of services. As health care expanded, corporate involvement in the direct provision of services emerged. This involvement is reflected not only in the rise of for-profit providers, but also in the influence of hospital administrators, utilization review organizations, insurance bureaucrats, and other functionaries unfamiliar with the clinical encounter, but well versed on the bottom line. Corporate providers' quest for increasing revenues has brought them into conflict with corporate purchasers of care, whose employee benefit costs have skyrocketed. This intercorporate conflict powerfully shapes health policy and has caused the rapid proliferation of health maintenance organizations and other forms of prospective payment. Corporate purchasers of care favor the incentives under prospective payment for providers to curtail care and its costs. For corporate providers, prospective payment has allowed increased profits even in the face of constrained revenues, because reimbursement is disconnected from resource use. Unfortunately, this corporate compromise serves patients and physicians poorly. Alternative policy options that challenge corporate interests could save money while improving care.\r"

Experimental transmission of the disease to laboratory animals was successful, using tissues from both siblings, through inoculation of fresh brain homogenates, purified prion protein, and formalin-fixed brain homogenates. Prion protein fractions from the patient's brain shortened the incubation periods and formalin-fixed mouse brains did not lengthen the periods. The disease in the two brothers can be classified as Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, a familial variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease manifests a variety of clinicopathological features. Immunohistological verification of kuru plaques has major diagnostic value in assessing dementia.\r"

The purified antiidiotypic antibody did not bind beta-endorphin but competed with [125I]beta-endorphin for rat brain opiate receptors. Normal IgG that was similarly treated had negligible competitive effects. The antibody bound to the membrane preparation; such binding was inhibited by opiate receptor ligands. Binding of the antiidiotype to a 60,000-dalton protein from rat brain was detected by Western immunoblot analysis. This protein corresponds in molecular weight to proteins proposed to be components of opiate receptors. These findings imply that immune reactivity to neuropeptides could contribute to psychiatric impairment.\r"

Eighty-five patients (54 ACB positive) received 10 days of RIF-TMP, 71 patients (45 ACB positive) received 10 days of SMX-TMP, and 18 patients (18 ACB positive) received 6 weeks of SMX-TMP. The overall recurrence rates in patients who received 10 days of therapy were 32% for RIF-TMP and 23% for SMX-TMP (P = 0.13). There were 12 (14%) relapses in the RIF-TMP group compared with 2 (3%) relapses in the SMX-TMP group (P = 0.01). In patients with upper-tract infections, the relapse rates were not statistically significantly different (P = 0.13). There were two (11%) recurrences (one relapse and one reinfection) in the 6-week treatment group.

  ".W": "In two prospective, randomized multicenter double-blind studies with a dosage of either 250 mg given four times a day (study A) or 500 mg given two times a day (study B), the comparative efficacy and safety of cephalexin hydrochloride (LY061188; Keftab) and cephalexin monohydrate (Keflex) for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections were determined. In study A, 97 patients received cephalexin hydrochloride and 101 patients received cephalexin monohydrate. In study B, 75 patients received cephalexin hydrochloride and 70 patients received cephalexin monohydrate. Diagnoses included abscesses, cellulitis, wound infections, and infected dermatitis, and were comparable in the different treatment groups. Pathogens were isolated from 82% of patients enrolled; the majority of isolates were of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, other staphylococcal species, and a few gram-negative bacteria. In study A, 68 of 71 (95.7%) evaluable patients who received cephalexin hydrochloride responded satisfactorily; 73 of 81 (90%) patients who received cephalexin monohydrate also responded satisfactorily. In study B, 56 of 58 (96.5%) evaluable patients who received cephalexin hydrochloride responded satisfactorily; 47 of 50 (94%) patients who received cephalexin monohydrate also responded satisfactorily. An adverse clinical event leading to discontinuation of the treatment drug developed in 17 of 343 (4.95%) patients in both studies. No differences were noted between the two drugs. Skin eruptions, pruritis, and mild gastrointestinal symptoms were the common adverse effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We report three children with crescentic glomerulonephritis in whom ANCA concentrations were raised at presentation. Two cases were idiopathic, and the other later developed features of Wegener's granulomatosis. In all three, plasma exchange and immunosuppression removed ANCA, but in only one case was there clinical improvement. This child later developed classical nasal lesions of Wegener's granulomatosis associated with a decline in renal function and a rise in ANCA. Plasma exchange and immunosuppression again produced a good clinical response and removed ANCA. This suggests that ANCA is either a marker of disease activity, or is involved in the pathogenesis of disease.\r"

Of 51 live born infants, five died (two with renal failure), and only 18 (35%) had a clinically detectable abnormality at birth. Twenty seven patients underwent postnatal operations, the remainder being treated conservatively. Antenatal counseling was seldom undertaken by those responsible for the postnatal care. There were many instances of prospective parents receiving little or inappropriate information. Greater cooperation is required between all the staff concerned particularly as the natural history and appropriate postnatal management of some urinary tract abnormalities are still not known.\r"

Complications included torsion and rupture and usually occurred in cysts more than 5 cm in diameter. Surgical removal, either oophorectomy or cystectomy, was the treatment of choice. Because even cystectomy results in loss of normal ovarian tissue, and because spontaneous regression of cysts less than 5 cm in diameter can occur, a more conservative approach is now proposed. Regular ultrasonography alone is recommended if the cysts are less than 5 cm in diameter, and aspiration of the cysts followed by regular ultrasonographs if the cysts are more than 5 cm in diameter. Operation should be reserved for recurrent cysts or for those with complications. Cysts diagnosed antenatally may be aspirated in utero if there are signs of thoracic compression.\r"

Arterial oxygen saturation fell by 2-6% during or after treatment in 10 cases: seven with compressed air, two with oxygen, and one with both driving gases. Hypoxaemia occurred in younger children and in those who fell asleep, but was not related to the level of arterial oxygen saturation before treatment or the size of the response to bronchodilator therapy. More children fell asleep with compressed air nebulisation. Arterial oxygen saturation improved and heart rates remained stable during treatment when oxygen was the driving gas. After treatment, however, arterial oxygen saturation fell and heart rates rose to values that were similar to those after treatment with compressed air. The falls in arterial oxygen saturation we observed, though comparatively small, would be clinically important on the steep part of the oxygen dissociation curve, and our results emphasise that families with home nebulisers should seek medical advice early when their children develop severe asthma. The benefits of using oxygen as the driving gas during nebulisation were transient, and in severe asthma treatment with oxygen needs to be continued after the nebulised salbutamol has been given.\r"

A smaller proportion of patients required operations than in other series reported. Shortly after birth the kidney undergoes physiological adjustments and investigation may be carried out too soon. It should be delayed, especially if the infant is well. The timing of postnatal ultrasonography is important and the advice of a paediatric urologist should be sought before investigations are carried out.\r"

  ".U": "88325688\r", 
  ".W": "Survival after repair of postinfarction ventricular septal defects remains poor, often due to extensive loss of contractile muscle in the septum or left ventricle. We evaluated whether a contractile flap of right ventricular muscle could be used to repair a similar ventricular septal defect to augment left ventricular performance in 7 fully instrumented mongrel dogs (weight, 23 to 28 kg). By using hypothermic bypass and cold fibrillatory arrest, a trapezoidal right ventricle flap was fashioned from the free wall of the mid to lower right ventricle, basing its widest portion anteriorly on the septum and left ventricle. A large, 2-cm-diameter core of septum was excised beneath this flap to simulate a postinfarct ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular flap was then invaginated through the defect and sewn to the left ventricular side of the septum with pledgeted sutures taken full thickness through the flap and septum in a \"vest-over-pants\" fashion. Contraction of the right ventricular flap was confirmed visually and by postbypass multiple gated acquisition scans. The right ventricular defect was closed with fascia lata. All dogs were weaned from bypass without inotropes. Precardiac and postcardiac outputs of 2.5 +/- 0.5 versus 2.3 +/- 0.4 L/min and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures of 4 +/- 2 versus 4 +/- 3 mm Hg were identical. No shunts were detected by oxygen saturation. Autopsies confirmed the integrity of the repair. We conclude that septal defects can be repaired by using contractile right ventricular muscle, thus preserving left ventricular function. This technique offers promise for repair of postinfarction ventricular septal defects by using autologous, already conditioned to contract, cardiac muscle, but its application in humans must await long-term testing.\r"

Chronic total occlusion of the left main coronary artery has been reported in 59 patients, including 3 at our institution. These patients present with chronic but increasingly severe angina. A right dominant coronary anatomy is always found, usually with well-developed right-to-left collaterals. The results of surgical revascularization in our 3 patients and in 45 others described in the literature support the safety and efficacy of this approach.\r"

  ".W": "The ideal preservation method and cooling temperature for transport of donor hearts are not known. Serious derangements in myocardial relaxation are well described with different methods of cooling. To assess this problem, human right atrial trabeculae contracting isometrically at 34 degrees C in vitro were subjected to hypothermic arrest at 1, 4, 12, and 20 degrees C for 1, 2, 4, 24, and 48 hours. Control conditions were resumed, and myocardial mechanical recovery was assessed over 1 hour. Contraction was 50% depressed after a 1- to 2-hour exposure to 1 degree C and was almost completely arrested following a 4-hour exposure. Muscles cooled to 4 degrees C recovered poorly, whereas those cooled to 12 and 20 degrees C did well. In the latter 2 groups, force development increased rapidly on rewarming and exceeded the precooling contraction force (p less than 0.05). A 100% increase in relative resting force was seen in muscles cooled to 1 and 4 degrees C (p less than 0.05). This finding suggests a failure of calcium homeostasis at very low temperatures. We conclude that atrial preservation is optimal at about 12 degrees C.\r"

A total of 1,010 surgical procedures were performed in 807 patients (35 refused operation). There was a total operative mortality of 0.6% (5 deaths). Procedures became more conservative as experience was gained, and 79% of the procedures were endocystectomies. Intact endocystectomy (Barrett's technique) without preliminary aspiration was the approach of choice. Careful protection of the operating field, suturing of all the bronchial openings, and capitonnage were the keys to successful treatment. One hundred six patients with intact endocystectomies done before July, 1975, were followed for 3 to 20 years. Ruptures occurred during cyst manipulation in 35 patients (33%). Recurrence after operation was seen in 2 patients (1.9%). There were no deaths among the patients undergoing intact endocystectomy. In comparison, we followed 136 patients who underwent aspiration endocystectomy and the recurrence rate was 3.7% (5 patients).\r"

The staging system for lung cancer has recently been modified, and at the present time Stage III disease is now subdivided into Stage III-A (potentially surgically resectable for cure) and Stage III-B (unresectable). This article will review five recently completed studies utilizing neoadjuvant therapy in various types of Stage III lung cancer. The thoracic surgeon is faced with the dilemma of reviewing this literature and trying to make a conclusion as to what is appropriate therapy for Stage III disease. Unquestionably, neoadjuvant therapy appears to increase the resectability rate in Stage III-A disease and can make some Stage III-B patients anatomically resectable. It is hoped that future well-designed phase III studies can be accomplished in Stages III-A and III-B disease so that we can determine whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy is or is not beneficial for these patients.\r"

We therefore tested the ability of acute change in forced expired volume in one second (FEV1) following inhaled beta agonist to predict long-term symptomatic response to albuterol and theophylline. We found that the reproducibility of acute change in FEV1 over three repetitions was poor (intraclass correlation 0.17). Furthermore, the mean improvement FEV1 following inhaled albuterol across the three repetitions did not relate closely to symptomatic response to either albuterol or theophylline. We conclude that acute response to inhaled beta agonist is not useful for identifying patients with chronic airflow limitation who are likely to benefit from bronchodilator treatment.\r"

Leprosy had never been reported from five of them. No patient had had contact with human leprosy. The patients were white; four were women; the mean +/- SD age at onset was 60.3 +/- 16.4 years (age range, 31 to 80 years); and the mean +/- SD interval to diagnosis was 1.2 +/- 1.4 years. One patient had Hodgkin's disease at the age of 25 years and leprosy at the age of 31 years; another patient had cervical carcinoma. All rural northern Louisiana residents coexist with armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus), some of which are infected with Mycobacterium leprae, the significance of which is unknown. Hypothetically, exposure to an unknown human case, reactivation of \"asymptomatic\" leprosy through immunosenescence or immunosuppression, or infection from an environmental source might have occurred. Because the patients lacked contact, travel, residence, and exposure risk factors, the origin of leprosy in the new indigenous cases is noteworthy and is not understood.\r"

Ninety-seven percent of patients were black; their age was 59 +/- 14 years (mean +/- SD); on average, they were hospitalized three times in the preceding year for problems related to their heart failure. Potential precipitating factors for decompensated heart failure were identified in 93% of patients. Lack of adherence to the prescribed medical regimen was the most commonly identified causative factor and was noted in 64% of the cases; noncompliance with diet amounted to 22%, with drugs to 6%, and with the combination of drugs and diet to 37%. Other factors also related to hospitalization were cardiac arrhythmias (29%), emotional/environmental issues (26%), inadequately conceived drug therapy (17%), pulmonary infections (12%), and thyrotoxicosis (1%). Thus, the key preventive measure necessary in at least two thirds of patients centered around better adherence to drug and/or diet regimen, highlighting the precept that better patient education is mandatory if we are to minimize the number of hospital admissions for decompensated heart failure.\r"

Subjects were instructed to maintain their usual cigarette intake during days 1 through 3 and cease smoking for days 4 through 6. All of the withdrawal symptoms measured (craving, irritability, anxiety, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and hunger) significantly increased during the three days of smoking cessation in the placebo group. There was a 4.3-fold increase in craving, a 3.8-fold increase in irritability, a 3.7-fold increase in anxiety, and a 3.3-fold increase in restlessness in the placebo group compared with the transdermal clonidine group during the three days of smoking cessation. Impairment of concentration and hunger were not significantly diminished by transdermal clonidine treatment during smoking cessation. In addition, a trend was present in the transdermal clonidine group to spontaneously decrease the number of cigarettes smoked per day during the smoking period. Side effects were generally mild. We conclude that transdermal clonidine treatment ameliorates some of the short-term withdrawal symptoms, especially craving, associated with smoking cessation.\r"

The primary site was identified while patients were alive in 27% and at autopsy in 57%; the site remained unidentified in 16%. The pancreas (26.5%), lung (17.2%), kidney (4.6%), and colorectum (3.6%) were the most frequent primary sites, but the reliability of diagnostic tests used in the search for this site was disappointing. Survival was identical in patients whose primary site was discovered while alive, at autopsy, or remained unknown. The number of metastases at presentation was the major prognostic factor. Analysis of autopsy data demonstrated that patients with carcinoma of unknown primary origin pursue a different course than expected when the primary site is the first manifestation of the disease. On the basis of these results and the results of other modern series, we suggest an approach consisting of a limited initial workup but with greater emphasis on modern histochemistry studies and immunohistopathologic and other kinetic and morphologic parameters to understand the patient tumor characteristics better and base the clinical management on an individual basis.\r"

Putative actions in lowering blood pressure and limiting myocardial infarct size require further study. The clinician needs to be aware of the dose- and time-dependent nature of the measurable effects of fish oil.

When termination of the pregnancy is unacceptable, decisions regarding the use of irradiation and chemotherapy are complicated by the well-known high risks of abortion and fetal malformation. This risk is concentrated in the first trimester and varies with the choice of chemotherapeutic agents or combinations of agents. There is only minimal evidence of increased risk of malformation or abortion in the second or third trimester. Recent progress in cancer therapy has made cure a reasonable goal, and for some malignant neoplasms, cure is still possible even when initial therapy is modified or delayed. When cure is a reasonable goal, curative therapy should not be compromised by modification or delay. When treatment for cure or significant palliation is not possible, however, the goal should shift to protection of the fetus from damage by the injudicious use of teratogenic cancer therapy. This report will review the available data that may assist in these difficult decisions.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of schizophrenic patients who fail to respond to adequate trials of neuroleptics is a major challenge. Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, has long been of scientific interest, but its clinical development has been delayed because of an associated risk of agranulocytosis. This report describes a multicenter clinical trial to assess clozapine's efficacy in the treatment of patients who are refractory to neuroleptics. DSM-III schizophrenics who had failed to respond to at least three different neuroleptics underwent a prospective, single-blind trial of haloperidol (mean dosage, 61 +/- 14 mg/d) for six weeks. Patients whose condition remained unimproved were then randomly assigned, in a double-blind manner, to clozapine (up to 900 mg/d) or chlorpromazine (up to 1800 mg/d) for six weeks. Two hundred sixty-eight patients were entered in the double-blind comparison. When a priori criteria were used, 30% of the clozapine-treated patients were categorized as responders compared with 4% of chlorpromazine-treated patients. Clozapine produced significantly greater improvement on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression Scale, and Nurses' Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation; this improvement included \"negative\" as well as positive symptom areas. Although no cases of agranulocytosis occurred during this relatively brief study, in our view, the apparently increased comparative risk requires that the use of clozapine be limited to selected treatment-resistant patients.\r"

The 86% two-year survival rate of the patients with poor span performance was considerably better, while the 44% one-year and the 21% two-year survival rates of patients with good span performance were considerably lower than previously reported survival rates for schizophrenic patients receiving a conventional dose of fluphenazine. The significant correlations in a patient's span performance for periods up to one year were consistent with the hypothesis that this task taps processes associated with vulnerability to schizophrenic disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The Technicon H-1 (H-1) is an automated hematology analyzer that provides a complete blood cell count, a six-part differential with absolute counts, and morphologic values with a left-shift flag (LS). To determine the sensitivity of the H-1 in detecting peripheral blood changes in acute inflammation, we first correlated the H-1 LS with band counts on the Hematrak 590 (H590), an automated digital image processor differential system. The H-1 sensitivity to H590 band counts above 11% was 76%, specificity was 82%, and efficiency was 80%. Each semiquantitative LS (1+, 2+, 3+), as well as a new factor, lobularity index, was correlated with the actual H590 band count. There was a definite direct proportional relationship between each semiquantitative LS and the mean band count. However, the wide overlaps of band count ranges corresponding to each semiquantitative flag rendered semiquantitation of limited value. Forty cases with the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis were similarly studied preoperatively. Thirty-three cases histologically showed acute inflammation. On the H-1, 79% (sensitivity) had LS flags, 88% had absolute neutrophilia (greater than 8 x 10(9)/L), 82% had relative neutrophilia (greater than 75%), and 91% had leukocytosis (greater than 10.5 x 10(9)/L). In comparison, sensitivities on the H590 were 70% for band counts above 11%, 82% for relative neutrophilia, and 85% for absolute neutrophilia. This study shows that the H-1 is at least as sensitive as the H590 to peripheral blood changes that indicate acute inflammation.\r"

In contrast, normal results were obtained in five radioimmunoassays that used either mouse monoclonal antibodies or antisera specific for human chorionic gonadotropin (n = 3) or thyrotropin (n = 2). Incubation of her serum with IgG from different species or with F(ab)'2 from mouse IgG prior to IEMA showed that the interference was markedly inhibited by mouse IgG, indicating an antibody specific for the Fc portion of mouse IgG. The interfering activity was bound to and eluted from a column containing Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. Fractionation of the eluted protein over another column containing Sephacryl S300 showed the activity was enriched in the first protein peak, which contained predominantly IgM. A model is proposed to explain how IgM anti-mouse IgG antibody selectively interferes in IEMAs that use mouse monoclonal antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Two alpha-fucose-binding lectins, Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA I) and Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin, were employed to compare and contrast the distribution of fucosubstance in normal human kidneys and a variety of renal tumors. The study employed a total of 31 kidneys surgically removed for the presence of a variety of tumors, including 11 unilateral Wilms' tumors, two cases of bilateral Wilms' tumors, 13 renal cell carcinomas, two congenital mesoblastic nephromas, one renal oncocytoma, one neuroblastoma metastatic to the kidney, and one clear cell sarcoma of the kidney. The results show that UEA I-reactive fucosubstance is detected in vascular endothelium of all kidneys and tumors, except bilateral Wilms' tumors. The presence of UEA I-reactive alpha-fucose in the vasculature of unilateral but not bilateral Wilms' tumors defines a unique histochemical distinction between the two groups of tumors. Conceivably, this property might be exploited as a screening procedure for the more aggressive bilateral neoplasms. Other findings detail histochemical differences between UEA I and L tetragonolobus agglutinin, as evidenced by the ability of one lectin to stain a particular cell type that is not reactive with the other lectin.\r"

The salient features were the presence of large API-containing globules in the adenomatous tissue and only minimally, in granular form, in hepatocytes. alpha 1-Proteinase inhibitor was not demonstrated in portal bile ducts entrapped in the adenomatous tissue or in bile ducts present in the liver parenchyma. Bile duct markers such as cytokeratin and carcinoembryonic antigens were present in the adenomatous tissue and also in the normal bile ducts, but not in the hepatocytes, suggesting that the adenomatous structures are ductular in origin, and probably not from ductular metaplasia of liver cells. Accumulation of API is postulated to be a triggering factor in neoplastic transformation.\r"

The specific accomplishments that constituted major advances were as follows. 1. Accumulation of adequate records and detailed reports for the first time permitted a complete military medical history. This led to the publication of the Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion, which was identified in Europe as the first major academic accomplishment by US medicine. 2. Development of a system of managing mass casualties, including aid stations, field hospitals, and general hospitals, set the pattern for management of the wounded in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. 3. The pavilion-style general hospitals, which were well ventilated and clean, were copied in the design of large civilian hospitals over the next 75 years. 4. The importance of immediate, definitive treatment of wounds and fractures was demonstrated and it was shown that major operative procedures, such as amputation, were optimally carried out in the first 24 hours after wounding. 5. The importance of sanitation and hygiene in preventing infection, disease, and death among the troops in the field was demonstrated. 6. Female nurses were introduced to hospital care and Catholic orders entered the hospital business. 7. The experience and training of thousands of physicians were upgraded and they were introduced to new ideas and standards of care. These included familiarity with prevention and treatment of infectious disease, with anesthetic agents, and with surgical principles that rapidly advanced the overall quality of American medical practice. 8. The Sanitary Commission was formed, a civilian-organized soldier's relief society that set the pattern for the development of the American Red Cross.\r"

Ataxia, adventitious movements, and sensory loss are due to infarction of the lateral, posterolateral, and posteromedial ventral nuclei caused by occlusion of the PCA proximal to the thalamogeniculate artery branches or by occlusion of large thalamogeniculate arteries.

However, if four readings are taken, the value of the Cavitron Biotronics tonometer that correlated best with Goldmann applanation tonometry was the one reading of the four with the highest value.

The results in terms of graft clarity and visual acuity are comparable with those in patients undergoing penetrating keratoplasty for keratoconus with no previous ocular surgery. Whether the relatively high rate of rejection episodes (three [43%]) seen in this small number of patients indicates some relationship between previous epikeratophakia and subsequent rejection after penetrating keratoplasty remains to be seen.\r"

Hypermetropia was the most commonly associated finding (eight eyes); in ten eyes, no consistent abnormal findings could be established. Among the less common causes were swelling of the optic nerve proper or the perineural sheaths and thickened extraocular muscles. Standardized echography demonstrated ocular changes, orbital changes, or both, in all but two patients (two eyes) with idiopathic folds. The most frequent findings were flattening of the posterior ocular wall (18 eyes), thickening of the retinochoroid layer (12 eyes), and distention of the optic nerve sheaths (eight eyes). While fluorescein angiography is well established as the preferred method of demonstrating choroidal folds, standardized echography may now be used to delineate the often subtle associated ocular and orbital findings.\r"

Near-normoglycemia was obtained with CSII and MI but not with CIT. A transient increase in microaneurysms and hemorrhages was seen at three months in CSII-treated patients. After 41 months, a moderate progression in microaneurysms and hemorrhages was registered, as assessed from fundus photographs, in all treatment groups. Fluorescein angiograms indicated a tendency (not statistically significant) to retarded progression of retinopathy in MI- and CSII-treated patients compared with CIT-treated patients. Soft exudates developed after three to six months of rapid tightening of metabolic control in 50% of patients on CSII and MI regimens. Those patients who had soft exudates had a slower progression of retinopathy three years later than those who did not develop soft exudates. Transient progression of retinopathy may be related to fluctuations in blood glucose levels, although a favorable effect of long-term improved metabolic control was not documented.\r"

Of the examination results, 45% in glaucomatous subjects and 30% in normal controls were considered unreliable with the use of the manufacturer's reliability criteria. Most test results were unreliable because they failed to meet the criterion for fixation loss. The greater rejection rate among glaucomatous subjects was entirely due to their higher rate of false-negative responses. Factors such as age, pupil diameter, and visual acuity did not explain the difference between the false-negative rates of glaucomatous patients and normal subjects.\r"

The advantages of delayed primary wound closure following evisceration of the globe for endophthalmitis include rapid removal of the intraocular abscess, continued drainage and mechanical debridement of the infected scleral pouch, and the development of granulation tissue resistant to bacterial growth at the wound margins prior to wound closure. These factors are important in reducing the risk of implant extrusion following evisceration of the globe for endophthalmitis.\r"

  ".U": "88326566\r", 
  ".W": "Not so long ago it was fashionable to ignore a little bit of hypertension in an elderly person. The rationalizations for this position included the limited epidemiological data establishing the risk of elevated blood pressure in the age group over 65, particularly for women; and concern that lowering the blood pressure might not be desirable, from the standpoint of reduced blood flow to vital organs. There was also concern over the known greater responsiveness or sensitivity of older people to customary doses. It was also argued by some that even if the blood pressure could be safely controlled it was hardly worth it, since age itself is the most powerful predictor of mortality in the elderly. Moreover, it seemed unlikely to many that the risk of hypertension could be reduced--that is, that life expectancy could be extended; at the same time it seemed fairly certain that the quality of life would be compromised by therapy. However, since systolic blood pressure continues to be predictive of coronary heart disease mortality well into the ninth decade, and since considerable life expectancy remains for those who have survived to their senior years, it seems logical to attempt to reduce the risk and preserve life expectancy by controlling blood pressure. The question is, is the evidence that treatment helps really convincing, or are we simply extrapolating from studies carried out in younger subjects? Review of the early literature, which focused almost exclusively on stroke survivors and the influence of hypertension on stroke recurrence, provides inconsistent, conflicting, and not persuasive information.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After a placebo period during which patients were informed by written instruction how to avoid only foods with a high Na content, 143 out-patients (84 males and 59 females, mean age 50.7 years, range 28-69) with DBP greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg randomly received for 4 weeks either metoprolol (M) 200 mg SR qd (67 patients), or S, 2 g bid to add to foods (76 patients). At the end of this period patients with DBP still greater than 90 mm Hg combined the two treatments for a further 4 weeks. Mean blood pressure (mm Hg), HR (bpm), 24-hrs urinary Na and K excretion were measured fortnightly. In comparison to pretreatment values MBP was significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced by both treatments, although to a greater extent in the M group already at the second week, without any further decrement thereafter. In the S group MBP decreased by 4.4 mm Hg and 27/76 patients were responders (DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg), while in the M group it was reduced by 9.0 mm Hg and 28/67 patients were responders. In the S group urinary Na excretion was significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than in the M group, and this difference was present until the end of period 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both agents produced significant (P less than 0.01) and comparable reductions in mean supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures (7/11 mm Hg on betaxolol and 9/10 mm Hg on propranolol). Both betaxolol and propranolol significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced mean supine heart rate by 9 beats per minute. Patients achieved a more significant (P less than 0.01) reduction in blood pressure earlier (weeks 2 and 4 of the titration period) with betaxolol. By the end of treatment there was no significant difference in response between treatment groups. A higher incidence of central nervous system side effects (insomnia, bizarre dreams, depression, hallucinations, dizziness), however, was seen with propranolol than with betaxolol. Overall, the data show that in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, betaxolol 10 to 40 mg administered once daily is as effective as and better tolerated than propranolol 40 to 160 mg administered twice daily.\r"

At the end of placebo and of the first and sixth month of treatment, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (ALD) and noradrenaline (NA), urinary enzymes (NAG: N-acetyl-beta glucosaminidase, AAP: alanine aminopeptidase) were measured. Compared to placebo, celiprolol significantly and steadily reduced BP and HR. However, although the systemic hemodynamic effect was constant during the whole period of the study, the reduction of renovascular resistance and of plasma noradrenaline, detectable at the first month of therapy, disappeared at the sixth month. However, PRA, plasma aldosterone, GFR, and urinary enzymes did not change. These findings suggest that the antihypertensive effect of celiprolol is well maintained over the 6-month period; the drug did not exert any adverse effect on the kidney, and chronic celiprolol treatment does not influence renal hemodynamics.\r"

However, lisinopril produced a significant fall (14%, P less than 0.001) in cardiac output that was not seen with captopril or enalapril therapy. Moreover, lisinopril elicited an increase in renal blood flow (22%, P less than 0.05) that was more marked than that with enalapril (12%) or captopril (4%). Although left ventricular mass was reduced (P less than 0.05) with all three agents, enalapril induced a twofold greater reduction (29%) than captopril (14%) or lisinopril (12%).

Eleven of these 20 patients exhibited impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), while the remaining nine patients had normal glucose tolerance (NGT). All patients tolerated long-term captopril therapy with no untoward effects. Six months' administration of captopril significantly decreased blood pressure in patients with NGT from 171 +/- 12/105 +/- 5 mm Hg (mean +/- SE) to 146 +/- 7/88 +/- 4 mm Hg. Also in patients with IGT, long-term captopril therapy decreased blood pressure from 165 +/- 3/97 +/- 2 to 143 +/- 5/86 +/- 2 mm Hg. No patient with NGT developed diabetes mellitus. Neither fasting nor post-glucose-load venous blood glucose deteriorated in any of the patients during the therapy. There were no significant changes in the insulinogenic index (delta IRI/delta BG at 30 minutes after glucose load) in both the patients with NGT and IGT. In patients with IGT, the concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb A1 and Hb A1c slightly but significantly decreased from 8.1 +/- 0.3 to 7.7 +/- 0.4% (P less than 0.05) and from 5.9 +/- 0.3 to 5.5 +/- 0.3% (P less than 0.01) after 6.2 +/- 1.4 months' captopril therapy. These results suggest that in addition to its antihypertensive effects, long-term captopril therapy does not compromise glucose metabolism in hypertensive patients.\r"

Treatment with captopril caused a reduction in total cholesterol (-18%) and triglycerides (-26%) and an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (+27%). When patients returned to their precaptopril therapy, total and HDL cholesterol returned to precaptopril values.

Two hundred ninety-five essential hypertensives (WHO I/II) (140 male, 155 female, age 56-60 years) were treated for 12 weeks with either 30 to 90 mg urapidil bid or 12.5 to 50 mg captopril bid. Supine blood pressure values (mmHg, mean +/- SD) at the end of the 12-week treatment dropped for the urapidil group (n = 142) from 175/103 +/- 19/6 to 154/89 +/- 17/9 (P less than 0.001), and in the captopril group (n = 153) from 175/103 +/- 19/6 to 154/90 +/- 19/9 (P less than 0.001), corresponding to 62% urapidil and 58% captopril responder rates. The results demonstrate that the two antihypertensive medications with different modes of action control blood pressure with equal efficacy at three dose levels. A dose decrease was possible in 20% of each group, but a dose increase was necessary in 39% of urapidil and 44% of captopril group.\r"

All patients were hospitalized and placed on a constant sodium diet (7 g of NaCl/day) throughout the study. After an overnight fast, a 1.25-mg dose of cilazapril was given orally once a day for 5 or 8 days. On the first and last days of treatment, blood samples were taken and blood pressure was measured. All patients tolerated cilazapril with no untoward effects. Cilazapril induced a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and its antihypertensive effect was still present 24 hours after administration. Serum ACE activity was markedly suppressed for at least 24 hours. The peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of cilazapril and its diacid were 117 and 24.6 ng/mL on the first treatment day, and 144 and 31.1 ng/mL on the last day. The area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of cilazapril and its diacid were 408 and 227 ng.h/mL on the first day, and 501 and 305 ng.h/mL on the last day. In looking at the data gathered on the first and last treatment days, no significant differences were noted in Cmax and AUC values. These results suggest that cilazapril has a long-lasting effect and is a useful antihypertensive agent in controlling blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Fosenopril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is a prodrug that is converted to its active diacid metabolite after intestinal absorption. Its excretion is equally divided between hepatic and renal routes. This study details the efficacy of fosenopril at rest and during exercise on blood pressure, plasma potassium, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone in 11 hypertensive males, mean age 55 years. Individual subjects underwent an identical exercise protocol (bicycle ergometry) on placebo and on active treatment. Supine mean blood pressure fell from 116 to 100 mm Hg, P less than 0.005, and at 9 minutes of exercise mean blood pressure fell from 137 to 125 mm Hg, P less than 0.01 on fosenopril. Plasma potassium fell slightly at rest from 4.27 to 3.96 mmol/L and during exercise from 5.23 to 4.93 mmol/L, both P less than 0.025. Plasma renin activity (ng/mL/hr) rose on fosenopril, at rest 0.94 to 4.72, and during exercise 2.06 to 10.39, both P less than 0.005. Aldosterone changes on treatment were marginal and nonsignificant. The compound was well tolerated and free of subjective and routine laboratory side effects. Its antihypertensive action is broadly similar to the other ACE inhibitors currently available.\r"

Because both types of blockers exert comparable effects on cardiac performance, oxygen supply to the working muscle, and extramuscular substrate mobilization, the difference in exercise capacity is apparently due to other factors. The available information in the literature along with experimental results from our laboratory suggests that inhibition of intramuscular lipolysis only occurs with nonselective beta-blockade and may partly account for this difference. In addition, alterations in potassium fluxes are particularly induced by nonselective beta-blockade and result in more pronounced decreases in the intracellular-extracellular potassium ratio during exercise than caused by placebo or beta 1-selective blockade. In contrast to what was initially proposed, intramuscular glycogenolysis appears not to be affected by either type of beta-blockade, and a decrease is unlikely to be involved in the reduced exercise capacity.\r"

Following a 4-week placebo phase, 63 patients were randomly assigned to receive dilevalol and 65 to receive placebo. A titration phase followed during which the dose of dilevalol was increased every other week from 100 mg to 800 mg to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) less than 90 mm Hg and decreased by 10 mm Hg or more from baseline. A matching number of placebo capsules for each dose level of dilevalol was dispensed for blinding purposes. Patients who had at least a 5 mm Hg reduction in SDBP entered a 1-month maintenance phase. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured weekly 20 to 24 hours after a dose. This study demonstrated that the minimally effective dose of dilevalol was 100 mg, which was shown to result in a significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) greater reduction in systolic BP. A once-daily dose of 200 mg was superior to placebo in both systolic and diastolic BP effects (P less than 0.001 and less than 0.001, respectively), and this superiority was seen again at both the end of titration and the end of the study. The BP reduction was accompanied by a small (5 bpm) decrease in heart rate. The side effect profile of dilevalol was not different from placebo. Dilevalol appears to have no adverse effect on plasma lipids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We objectively assessed taste acuity using Henkin's three-drop stimulus technique and measured plasma zinc (PZn) level and urinary zinc excretion in 31 hypertensive patients. Of these, 11 were long-term, high-dose captopril recipients (more than 6 months, 266 +/- 34 mg/day), six were short-term captopril recipients (less than 6 months, 104 +/- 40 mg/daily dose), and the remaining 14 served as noncaptopril controls. Compared to controls, the long-term captopril group had significantly higher taste detection and recognition thresholds, lower PZn (91 +/- 3 vs. 100 +/- 3 micrograms/dl, P less than 0.05) and higher urinary zinc excretion (1017 +/- 89 vs. 609 +/- 76 micrograms/day, P less than 0.005). The short-term captopril group did not differ significantly from the noncaptopril group except for higher taste-recognition thresholds for NaCl and sucrose (P less than 0.05). Discontinuing captopril improved taste acuity and almost normalized zinc parameters in two patients on long-term captopril. These results suggest that abnormalities of taste are commonly associated with captopril therapy and may be related to changes in zinc metabolism. This is especially true in patients on long-term, high-dose captopril therapy.\r"

Serotonin may cause vasoconstriction either directly or indirectly by amplifying the actions of vasoconstrictor substances. Clinical trials indicate that ketanserin, a serotonin antagonist, is effective in treating hypertension. It is desirable for an antihypertensive agent to enhance or preserve renal hemodynamic function. In this study, we evaluated the acute (1 week) and chronic (8 weeks) effects of ketanserin (20-40 mg twice a day) on glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and sodium excretion in patients with uncomplicated hypertension. Patients with untreated diastolic blood pressure (greater than 90 mm Hg) received either ketanserin or a placebo during an 8-week double-blind trial. Findings demonstrated that patients treated with ketanserin showed an increase in renal plasma flow compared with those who received placebo. Sodium excretion remained unchanged, indicating the absence of sodium retention during therapy. These results show that ketanserin lowers blood pressure in essential hypertension while preserving renal hemodynamics and function.\r"

  ".W": "Studies on animal models demonstrate that platelet products contribute to vascular spasm in ischemic syndromes and that this is reversible with administration of ketanserin and thromboxane synthesis inhibitors. Laboratory animals (dogs, rabbits, and rats) that had femoral artery ligations exhibited supersensitivity to serotonin within days in their collateral blood vessels. This supersensitivity lasted at least 6 months. The response to serotonin was reversed by ketanserin, but not by 5HT-1 antagonists. Supersensitivity does not extend to norepinephrine, and alpha blockers do not influence the response to serotonin. It appears that platelet activation by endothelial injury contributes to ischemia through blood vessel occlusion and vascular spasm. When platelet activation occurs in vivo, blood vessel occlusion and vascular spasm are reversible in part by using ketanserin or agents that block thromboxane synthesis or its action. Combining both classes of agents reverses spasm completely. These findings support existing evidence that platelet products contribute to vascular disease, and provide an approach to improved management with currently available pharmacologic agents.\r"

  ".W": "Ketanserin is an agent whose main pharmacologic action is antagonism of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) receptors of the 5HT2 subtype. It also has weak alpha 1-adrenergic blocking properties, which may contribute to the acute blood pressure lowering effects seen in animal models of hypertension. During chronic treatment of hypertension in animals, the 5HT2 antagonistic properties, or a combination of 5HT2 and alpha 1-antagonistic effects, seems to be responsible for ketanserin's hypotensive action. Studies of patients with hypertension have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of ketanserin in monotherapy and combination therapy. In humans, the drug has a terminal half-life of 12-25 hours, and a twice daily dosage will lower blood pressure over the day. Ketanserin is a vasodilator that acts on both resistance and capacitance vessels. Chronic treatment with the drug causes minimal reflex changes in cardiovascular function, as well as sustained blood pressure reduction comparable with the effects of beta-adrenergic blockers or diuretics. In elderly patients, the therapeutic effects of ketanserin appear to be greater, and side effects are less frequent compared with beta-blockers and diuretics. In addition to its antihypertensive action, ketanserin also produces other effects that may be important in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension. Some studies have shown a reduction in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and a rise in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Ketanserin also reduces ex vivo platelet aggregation and inhibits the serotonin-induced platelet release reaction. Worldwide experience with ketanserin in the treatment of hypertension indicates that it is a safe and effective agent for long-term therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Middle ear effusions were collected from all subjects and plasma from a subset at the time of tympanostomy tube insertion. Histamine was assayed radioisotopically, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha (stable PGF2 alpha metabolite) by radioimmunoassay, and neutrophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis by modified Boyden chamber. Mean MEE levels of the mediators (39 +/- 13 ng/mL, 462 +/- 179 pg/mL, and 264% +/- 57% positive control, respectively) were markedly higher than those of corresponding plasma (0.5 +/- 0.1 ng/mL, 285 +/- 127 pg/mL, and 47% +/- 5% positive control, respectively).

Higher histamine levels were observed in effusions positive for Haemophilus influenzae when compared with those with other pathogenic isolates.

Half received interferon alfa-n1 intramuscularly at a dosage of 5 megaunits per square meter daily for 28 days and then thrice weekly for five months, followed by six months of observation. The other half were observed for six months and then treated. Operations were performed every two months to assess disease extent by a scale developed for this purpose. The score for the patients during the first observation period was stable. There was a statistically significant lowering of score in patients receiving interferon alfa-n1 during both periods of drug administration. Eight of 57 patients with assessable airway disease achieved complete remission, as did one additional patient with disease limited to the nasopharynx. No patients achieved complete remission during six months of observation alone. This difference was statistically significant. Patients without tracheostomy were significantly more likely to achieve remission than those with a tracheostomy. The patients who were observed after discontinuation of the drug therapy showed a significant rise in score within four months. Symptoms of toxicity included transient fever, fatigue, nausea, and headache. Elevations in serum aspartate aminotransferase levels occurred in 64% of the patients. There was an inverse correlation between age and the ability to tolerate the medication. The dose studied may be close to the maximum tolerated dose. It appears that interferon alfa-n1 as an adjuvant to routine surgical management is effective in slowing the growth of respiratory papillomas.\r"

The order of drug administration was not randomised because tolazoline has a half life of hours whereas epoprostenol has a half life of a few minutes. Both drugs caused pulmonary and systemic vasodilatation, and there were no significant differences between the two. The 95% confidence intervals suggest that tolazoline did not have a clinically important haemodynamic advantage over epoprostenol. Previous reports suggest that serious side effects are common when tolazoline is used in repeated doses; epoprostenol has only a few minor side effects that are rapidly reversible when the infusion is stopped. Epoprostenol is more expensive than tolazoline but this study suggests that epoprostenol is a more suitable pulmonary vasodilator if more than a single dose is required.\r"

Nine interrupted 10/0 nylon sutures are used to close a limbal section. Preoperative astigmatism is compensated for in the method of suturing by the placement of additional sutures. Postoperatively sutures are cut in line with the plus cylinder axis in eyes showing excessive astigmatism with the rule. Final postoperative astigmatism is controlled within 2.25 D cyl. 68% of cases lie within 1.0 D cyl with the rule to 1.0 D cyl against the rule. The average case in which sutures are not cut is one having 1.51 D cyl with the rule at one week postoperatively, declining to zero at approximately 12 weeks, and having a final value of 0.17 D cyl against the rule. No significant change in cylinder is seen after 10 weeks. The final postoperative astigmatism is only weakly correlated with the preoperative astigmatism, showing that the surgical method is effective. The spherical equivalent error is shown to shift in the direction of myopia in the postoperative period.\r"

Several limited studies have shown it to have fewer side effects, especially ocular complications, than the currently available drug, diethylcarbamazine. The detailed ocular findings in 200 moderately to heavily infected Liberians who were enrolled in a safety and dose-finding study are presented. They received either 0, 100, 150, or 200 micrograms/kg of ivermectin and were followed up for 12 months. In clinical studies so far carried out ivermectin in a dose of 100, 150, or 200 micrograms/kg has not been associated with any major adverse reactions nor were there any sight-threatening effects even in the presence of severe ocular disease. Each of these doses significantly reduced the ocular microfilaria load for at least 12 months when compared with either the placebo (p less than 0.05) or pretreatment values (p less than 0.001). However, the 100 and 150 micrograms/kg doses caused fewer minor side effects than the higher dose. These results confirm that ivermectin in a single oral dose may be a safe and effective microfilaricidal drug for the treatment of onchocerciasis and that it appears to be free of major ocular side effects.\r"

In this report, 36 patients with IBL-like T-cell lymphoma were analyzed. The disease is clinically characterized by generalized lymph node swelling, hepatosplenomegaly, fever, skin rash, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, marked male predominance, predilection for the elderly, and poor prognosis. There was no association with human T-cell leukemia virus type I or human immunodeficiency virus. IBL-like T-cell lymphoma may be divided into two categories (CD4+ type and CD8+ type) by surface marker analysis. It can also be divided into three categories on the basis of the histologic findings of distribution of morphologically recognizable tumor cells: nine cases of \"inconspicuous type,\" six cases of \"patchy type,\" and 21 cases of \"diffuse type.\" Two cases of \"inconspicuous type\" converted later to \"diffuse type.\" DNA hybridization analyses in the ten recent cases revealed that three of four \"inconspicuous types\" and five of six \"diffuse types\" showed clonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor-beta chain gene without rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, providing strong evidence for clonal proliferation of T cells.\r"

The fraction with molecular weight (mol wt) 30 to 50 Kd containing partially purified granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) activity caused the differentiation of C51 cells to macrophages in vitro and in diffusion chambers in vivo. Treatment of young rats with this fraction aborted the development of chloroleukemia from transplanted C51 cells. In contrast, the fraction with mol wt 10 to 30 Kd containing virtually all the G-CSF activity exhibited no differentiation activity either in vitro or in vivo. It is concluded that in this rat myelogenous leukemia model partially purified GM-CSF but not G-CSF contains the effector molecule(s) causing terminal differentiation of C51 cells and tumor cell rejection.\r"

However, the level of c-fms expression was especially high in AML of the M5 stage. High levels of expression were not accompanied by either amplification or rearrangements of the c-fms gene in AML cell DNAs. In contrast, c-fms expression was not found in acute lymphoid leukemias, whether of T or B origin. Thus, c-fms expression appears as a specific molecular marker of leukemogenesis in the myeloid lineage.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of two distinct T-cell receptors (TCR) alpha/beta dimers or gamma/delta dimers, was systematically analyzed in peripheral blood lymphocytes form 26 recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants for leukemia. When using monoclonal antibody WT31, which recognizes a common epitope on the alpha/beta heterodimer, the expansion of peripheral CD3+, WT31- cells to 40% of the PBLSs was detected in two patients. In patient 2, the presence of circulating TCR gamma-bearing cells was directly demonstrated with monoclonal antibody Ti gamma A directed against the V gamma 9 J gamma p gene products. From CD3, WT31- clones derived from patients 1 and 2, sequential immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-CD3 and anti-C gamma to determine the CD3-associated structure. Molecular weights of gamma subunits were different in both patients, thus indicating structural heterogeneity. The ability of TCR gamma clones to proliferate when stimulated with anti-CD3 beads was observed for clones from patient 2, whereas this response required exogenous interleukin-2 for clones from patient 1. We have already shown that the TCR gamma cells from patient 1 might have played a role in the immunodeficient state. Similar conclusions cannot be drawn from patient 2. Southern blot analysis of total PBL gamma cell lines and clones indicated that this major circulating subset of TCR gamma cells retained a TCR beta gene in germline configuration and preferentially expressed a single V gamma gene, V gamma 5 for patient 1 and V gamma 9 for patient 2.\r"

Supernatant fluids from cultures induced with increasing concentrations of IL-1 were found to stimulate colony formation of myeloid (CFU-GM), erythroid (BFU-E), and multipotent (CFU-GEMM) progenitor cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The effect on mixed colony formation, however, was less than on CFU-GM and BFU-E growth. Similar to IL-1, the synthetical double-stranded RNA poly(rI).poly(rC) also stimulated release of CSA by fibroblasts. The kinetics of IL-1- and poly(rI).poly(rC)-induced CSA release were found to be different, in that poly(rI).poly(rC)-induced CSA production occurred more slowly. Anti-IL-1 antiserum was able to completely neutralize the IL-1-induced CSA release, but had no effect on poly(rI).poly(rC)-induced CSF production, suggesting that the latter effect was mediated by other mechanisms than IL-1 in supernatant. By the use of specific immunologic assays, G-CSF, M-CSF, and GM-CSF could be identified in media conditioned by fibroblasts treated with IL-1 or poly(rI).poly(rC). Poly(rI).poly(rC) appeared to be a better inducer for M-CSF than IL-1.\r"

The minimal detectable level of hM-CSF was 10 U/mL, and the assays showed good reproducibility. As measured by this method, the average serum hM-CSF level of 20 normal adults was 540 +/- 110 U/mL (range, 300 to 800 U/mL). The peak of hM-CSF measured by ELISA was identical to that measured by bioassay when semipurified CSF-HU was fractionated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This method detected two types of hM-CSF, which had approximate molecular weights of 85 Kd (CSF-HU) and 45 Kd in human serum and urine; the ratio of 85:45 Kd was very high in serum and the amounts of the two types were nearly equal in urine. After anticancer chemotherapy, the serum hM-CSF level of one half of the patients with hematological malignancy was elevated according to the reduction in neutrophil number, while it was almost in the normal range in the other half of the patients, indicating the possibility that anticancer chemotherapy damaged the hM-CSF-producing cells. This ELISA method may be useful for monitoring the serum hM-CSF level after anticancer chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The hematopoietic growth factor CSF-1 has been considered relatively lineage specific for the production of macrophages, whereas GM-CSF elicits a predominance of neutrophils. It is likely that in vivo, individual clones are stimulated by the two CSFs, although the effect of dual stimulation on progenitors and their progeny has not been completely explored. We found that in cultures initiated with low concentrations of CSF-1 or GM-CSF, alone or in combination, production of macrophages predominated. Maximally stimulatory concentrations of CSF-1 elicited a predominance of macrophages, whereas maximal GM-CSF elicited many more neutrophil/macrophage colonies and pure neutrophil colonies. A combination of maximal CSF-1 and GM-CSF elicited the same differentiation as GM-CSF alone. Delayed addition of GM-CSF to cultures initiated with CSF-1 elicited colonies indistinguishable from GM-CSF alone, suggesting that neutrophil production had been switched on by GM-CSF. In mapping studies, colonies initiated by CSF-1 increased or switched on neutrophil production when GM-CSF was added as a second stimulus. These studies show that individual clones are responsive to both CSFs, and that the differentiating influence of GM-CSF predominates over that of CSF-1. In cultures to which only CSF-1 was added, a population of progenitors was sustained that produced neutrophils only after a GM-CSF stimulus. Thus, CSF-1 may participate in maintaining a reserve of progenitors for neutrophils during periods of increased neutrophil demand.\r"

  ".W": "The antileukemic activity of murine recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) and a combination of rGM-CSF and recombinant interleukin-3 (rIL-3) was examined by using a murine model of spontaneous B-cell leukemia (BCL1) in BALB/c mice. All untreated mice inoculated with 2 x 10(2) BCL1 cells developed leukemia within 4 weeks, with extreme lymphocytosis and a massive increase in both spleen weight and cell number while the number of myeloid progenitors (CFU-C) per spleen was decreased. In contrast, rGM-CSF-or rGM-CSF- and rIL-3-treated recipients did not show any evidence of leukemia or splenomegaly at 4 weeks and showed a significant increase in CFU-C per spleen. Hematologic parameters in the peripheral blood of untreated mice showed anemia and thrombocytopenia. Significant elevations in these parameters were recorded in mice treated with either protocol of CSF. Treatment of recipient mice with either rGM-CSF or rGM-CSF and rIL-3 prolonged their median survival from 6 weeks in untreated controls (range, 5 to 9 weeks) up to the time they were killed at 105 days. Adoptive transfer of spleen cells obtained from mice treated with rGM-CSF, mice treated with a combination of rGM-CSF and rIL-3, and untreated controls, into normal secondary recipients indicated improved survival in recipients inoculated with rGM-CSF. These data indicate that CSFs may inhibit in vivo expansion of leukemic cells of lymphoid origin.\r"

This method allowed us to detect as little as 3% of N-ras-mutated cells within a population. When the patient went into clinical remission, the mutation became undetectable. When a relapse occurred, the blasts did not carry the N-ras mutation. Analysis of M13 cloned amplified N-ras sequences from relapse DNA revealed exclusively the wild type allele of the N-ras gene. These findings suggest that the relapse cell population is derived from a different clone than the acute phase population. Furthermore, the data argue that N-ras mutation is not an initiating lesion in this case of acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML).\r"

IVDSA (n = 26) showed a 23 per cent aneurysmal degeneration rate which increased to 40 per cent with Duplex scanning (n = 25). Although the differences obtained in those patients receiving both examinations (n = 19) were statistically not significant, Duplex scanning appeared to be more sensitive, demonstrating two additional cases of aneurysmal degeneration not detected by IVDSA. Since, moreover, Duplex scanning proved able to detect anastomotic stenosis, it appears to be the examination of choice in long-term follow-up of the HUV graft. Despite this relatively high degeneration rate, the authors consider continued use of the HUV graft in selected patients to be justified, especially when the long-term patency rates, the available alternatives, and the less favourable long-term survival after femoropopliteal reconstruction are taken into consideration.\r"

  ".W": "Canine abdominal aortas have been replaced with Dacron arterial prostheses to assess the effects of mesothelial cell seeding on graft prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 release. At both 2 weeks and 6 weeks after surgery, three seeded and two unseeded control grafts were examined for prostacyclin release. In addition, thromboxane release was assessed in one seeded and one unseeded graft. Sections of aorta and graft were removed and incubated in PBS containing either 10 microM calcium ionophore A23187 or 20 microM arachidonic acid. The incubation mixture was sub-sampled at 5 min intervals over a 20 min period to assess the progressive release of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 using a radioimmunoassay for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 respectively. In seeded grafts, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha release averaged 15 per cent compared with aorta at 2 weeks and 45 per cent compared with aorta at 6 weeks. By contrast, release from unseeded grafts was undetectable at 2 weeks; however, by 6 weeks there was some release amounting to 15 per cent compared with aorta. There was a statistically significant increase in the release of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha from mesothelial cell seeded grafts at 6 weeks compared with unseeded grafts (P less than 0.01). Thromboxane release from the graft sections was variable and unrelated to whether the grafts had been seeded or not. These preliminary results, showing that grafts seeded with autologous peritoneal mesothelial cells release more prostacyclin than unseeded grafts, further highlight the role of the mesothelial cell as an alternative to the endothelial cell for improving the patency of arterial Dacron prostheses in the early postoperative days.\r"

Proper extrication of the victims is vital; the ideal device should be easily assembled and applied, should facilitate removal of victims from automobile seats without changing the body's position, must not hinder airway access or the performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, must accommodate all types of patients, including children and obese or pregnant patients, and must completely immobilize the patient, especially if hyperextension is suspected. Current methods of immobilization, such as the use of a soft collar and sandbags, allow neck extension; the short board protects against extension but interferes with airway access. Newer devices are discussed in this article. Injuries of the upper cervical spine are less common but more serious than those of the lower portion and usually involve the vertebral arch. Radiologic examination of the first and second cervical vertebrae and the seventh cervical and first thoracic vertebrae should be emphasized. If lateral and anteroposterior views do not reveal abnormal findings and injury is still suspected, oblique views and computed or conventional tomography should be used. Cervical spinal cord injuries can be minimized or prevented if proper early management is applied.\r"

Four patients had stage III disease and nine had stage IV disease (one with pulmonary and eight with gastrointestinal involvement). Treatment consisted of monthly courses of actinomycin D, 1 mg/m2, and vinblastine sulfate, 6 mg/m2, given intravenously on day 1, bleomycin, 10 mg/m2 given intravenously on days 1 and 8, and human lymphoblastoid (alpha-) interferon, 10 million U/m2 given subcutaneously three times a week for six doses starting on day 14. Forty-one treatment cycles (median 3, range 1 to 12) were administered. The median granulocyte and platelet counts on day 14 before the start of interferon therapy were 600 X 10(9)/L and 134 X 10(9)/L respectively; the counts did not fall further during interferon therapy. There was no difference in T-cell subsets, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase level or results of blastogenesis studies after interferon therapy. Four patients required admission to hospital for neutropenia-associated fever. A complete response (of 24 weeks' duration) was seen in one patient and a partial response (of 14 to 44 weeks' duration) in four. One patient had a mixed response, with regression of skin involvement but progression of pulmonary disease. The median length of survival was 48 (range 4 to 143) weeks. Eleven patients died of progressive Kaposi's sarcoma, one of lymphoma and one of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The results suggest that this form of therapy is not appropriate for patients with Kaposi's sarcoma associated with AIDS.\r"

There were 68 patients (age range, 20 to 73 years) with 83 aspirations; 30 were interpreted as positive for neoplasm (adenoma or carcinoma), 43 were negative, and ten (12%) were technically unsatisfactory. Thyroidectomy was performed on 25 patients who had positive aspirates. Subsequent morphologic study showed that 13 patients had carcinomas, ten had adenomas, and two had adenomatoid nodules (false-positive rate of FNAB for neoplasms was 8%). One of three thyroidectomy patients with negative preoperative aspirates had a carcinoma and two had adenomas (estimated minimal false-negative rate of FNAB was 9%). Nineteen patients who underwent thyroidectomies had dynamic radioisotopic thyroid angiography. There was no correlation between the pattern of vascularity and the type of neoplasm. Ultrasound (US) study was performed on 17 patients. Both adenoma and carcinoma can be solid or partially cystic. Although approximately 33% of the nodules initially diagnosed by FNAB as follicular or papillary neoplasms had different interpretations on subsequent examination of thyroidectomy specimens, 93% of the patients selected to be operated on had either adenoma or carcinoma. Thus, in this series, FNAB of cold thyroid nodules gave more useful diagnostic information than nodule size, dynamic radioisotopic scan, or US studies.\r"

There was a significantly higher incidence of HNP-secreting tumors for patients with extensive disease and two or more metastatic lesions than for patients with limited disease. There were no clear differences in response to treatment or in survival between patients with HNP-secreting tumors and those with nonsecreting tumors. Response to treatment evaluated by the change in plasma HNP, gave a 91% agreement with independently derived clinical impressions. Our data indicates that HNP evaluations provide sufficient sensitivity to forecast clinical response when it cannot be clearly assessed by conventional methods.\r"

For patients who received multi-agent chemotherapy, the cumulative probability of developing acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) or bone sarcoma was 6.2% and 5.5%, respectively, at 10 years from the initiation of therapy; the cumulative risk of all SM in this group reached 18.7% at 15 years. For patients who received radiation alone or with single-agent chemotherapy, the cumulative risk of SM rose from 0% at 10 years and 2% at 15 years, to 10.7% at 25 years from the initiation of treatment. The risk of ANLL after childhood HD was highest in the first 5 to 10 years after combined modality treatment, and aggressive forms of NHL were associated with excessive immunosuppression. Bone sarcomas predominated in solid SM in the first decade after HD treatment, whereas \"adult-type\" cancers, for example, breast and colon carcinomas, were more delayed. Our findings, supported by a literature review, point to a therapy-related enhanced risk of approximately age-appropriate solid SM. This possibility mandates careful surveillance of long-term survivors of childhood HD.\r"

Two of these patients' femoral heads showed microfocal avascular necrosis. Although high-dose steroids were used in these patients, none had suffered clinically from hip disease while alive. These findings suggest the possibility that local arterial disease may be involved in the pathogenesis of avascular necrosis.\r"

  ".W": "This series represents a relatively short follow-up study of patients who were treated with cementless revisions for failed previous arthroplasties. Many of these cases required extensive bone grafting to the acetabulum and often to the femur. Despite extensive bone grafting, there were no infections. There has been but a single graft resorption after a hemiarthroplasty conversion for recurrent dislocations. To date, all other grafts have remained intact and have shown signs of union. Even though the acetabular components were not anchored in place by adjuvant fixation devices such as screws, migration of the acetabular component has not been a problem. All other components have remained stable, and the supporting grafts appear to have united successfully. Femoral revision has been more technically demanding because the largest stem possible should be placed within the femur to prevent subsidence and provide good stabilization in the proximal metaphyseal area. These short-term results compared favorably with similar series of cemented revisions. Patient selection is important and there are definite candidates for cemented femoral components, particularly with first-time revisions in elderly patients. If there is massive osteolysis in the femur, cemented revision is probably not indicated. Long stems should not be used unless necessary. Cortical defects at the tip of the standard stem obviously would require bypassing the stress riser with a longer stem. If, however, the cortex is intact in this region and stability can be achieved, revision should be carried out with a relatively short stem. Techniques for cementless revision are demanding, but with meticulous attention to detail and technical perfection, the method has a most encouraging prognosis. Longer follow-up evaluations will be necessary to make an accurate evaluation of graft incorporation, but short-term results are encouraging to both surgeons and patients.\r"

Theophylline and its three main metabolites, 1-methyluric acid, 3-methylxanthine, and 1,3-dimethyluric acid, were analyzed in serum and urine by HPLC. The total body clearance, renal clearance, nonrenal clearance, and volume of distribution of theophylline were significantly greater (p less than 0.05) in patients with CF than in control subjects. The increased nonrenal clearance was the result of increased biotransformation to each of the three main metabolites. Patients with CF exhibited enhanced N-demethylation and 8-hydroxylation of theophylline, pathways that appear to be mediated by two different families of P-450 enzymes. Theophylline clearance after 2 weeks of pancreatic enzyme administration in the control subjects was the same as with placebo. Possible reasons for enhanced theophylline biotransformation in CF are discussed.\r"

It has been postulated that this \"food effect\" is caused at least in part by a transient increase in hepatic blood flow (QH) with its associated decrease in first-pass metabolism (hepatic extraction is a monotonic decreasing function of QH). A randomized crossover study using postural manipulations to produce changes in QH of the magnitude observed after food consumption (20% to 50%) was performed in an attempt to isolate the contribution of transient changes in QH to the food effect phenomenon. A solution of 80 mg propranolol HCl was taken orally and subjects were randomly assigned to postural manipulation protocols that should change QH such that AUC oral would be minimized (phase 1) or maximized (phase 2). Estimated QH (indocyanine green total body clearance from blood) was determined before and at three time points during each phase. It was observed that indocyanine green total body clearance during periods of standing was 15% to 40% below that observed during periods of seating (significant at p less than 0.05 for many of the appropriate comparisons). However, AUC oral for propranolol was not affected (mean +/- 1 SD; AUC phase 2/AUC phase 1+= 0.98 +/- 0.28) by these changes in QH, which are comparable to those encountered after food consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nasal absorption of nafarelin was increased by increasing the concentration of the drug in the dose solution and incorporating sodium glycocholate into the nasal formulation. An optimal formulation providing maximum nasal absorption of nafarelin was one containing 1.75 mg nafarelin per ml and 2% sodium glycocholate. Bioavailability of this nasal formulation relative to a single subcutaneous dose averaged 21%. The metabolism and excretion of nafarelin were determined in three subjects after subcutaneous administration of [14C]-nafarelin. Radioactivity was excreted in approximately equal amounts in urine and stool. Six metabolites accounted for most of the radioactivity in urine.

TNF produced a more sustained fall in blood pressure. Hypotension was not accompanied by a compensatory tachycardia after any of the test substances. Hypotension was associated with a fever after TNF, hypothermia after LPS and no significant change in temperature after IL-1. 3.

In an additional group of animals, including nine rats chronically exposed to CCl4 (CCl4 rats) and six control rats, a longitudinal study (protocol B) was performed to investigate the temporal relationship between changes in renal PG excretion, the renin--aldosterone system and renal function. 2. Urinary PG excretion was assessed by specific radioimmunoassay of PGE2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane (TX) B2 after extraction with octadecyl silica cartridges and h.p.l.c. purification. Recoveries for each prostanoid (61 +/- 8% for PGE2, 64 +/- 12% for PGF2 alpha, 65 +/- 11% for 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and 66 +/- 17% for TXB2) were determined in every sample by adding tritiated standards, and the final values were corrected according to the individual recoveries. 3. Cirrhotic rats with ascites in protocol A showed a significantly higher plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations and urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 than did control animals. Urinary excretion of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, however, was significantly reduced in cirrhotic animals as compared with controls. 4. In CCl4 rats included in protocol B, there was a close chronological relationship between the activation of the renin-aldosterone system, as estimated by urinary aldosterone excretion, the onset of sodium retention and the increase in urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2. The urinary excretion of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha in CCl4 rats was reduced throughout the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study was performed to investigate whether there were sustained effects after the termination of the isoprenaline infusion, as has been observed previously after the infusion of adrenaline. 2. The isoprenaline infusions produced dose-dependent increases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and metabolic rate, but similar increases in calf blood flow and decreases in diastolic blood pressure for the two infusion rates. Finger tremor was increased in amplitude by the 15 ng min-1 kg-1 infusion only. The changes in each of these physiological variables largely resolved within a few minutes of discontinuing the isoprenaline infusions. 3. There were no changes in arterialized venous plasma adrenaline or noradrenaline levels during the isoprenaline infusions. Mean peak plasma isoprenaline levels were 0.16 +/- 0.02 nmol/l during the 5 ng min-1 kg-1 infusion and 0.71 +/- 0.05 nmol/l during the 15 ng min-1 kg-1 infusion. 4. Plasma insulin levels increased with isoprenaline but blood glucose concentrations were unchanged, consistent with a direct effect of isoprenaline on beta 2-adrenoceptors mediating insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells. Blood glycerol concentration also increased with isoprenaline but blood lactate concentration was unaltered. 5. The present study demonstrates pronounced cardiovascular and metabolic effects of low dose isoprenaline infusions. Differences in the rate of resolution of the changes induced by isoprenaline and by adrenaline seen in previous studies may result from a significant difference in their metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "1. Physical effort involves, along with an increase in the plasma concentration of beta-endorphin, profound adaptations of the circulation and the endocrine system. The effects of opioid antagonism on the responses of blood pressure, heart rate and several hormones to exercise were therefore studied in 10 normal men. They exercised in the supine position up to 33% and 66% of their maximal exercise capacity and received in a randomized double-blind cross-over protocol, either saline or naloxone (10 mg intravenously, followed by a continuous infusion of 10 mg/h). 2. Intra-arterial pressure and heart rate were continuously monitored, but were not affected by naloxone. 3. At rest, opioid antagonism produced a rise in plasma renin activity and in plasma adrenocorticotropin, cortisol and aldosterone, but only the stimulation of the two adrenocortical hormones differed significantly from the control experiments; at rest naloxone also prevented the fall in plasma adrenaline, which occurred with saline infusion. Furthermore, the exercise-induced rises in plasma angiotensin II, aldosterone, cortisol, noradrenaline and adrenaline were higher on naloxone than on saline, while a similar tendency was also present for the increases with exercise in plasma renin activity and plasma adrenocorticotropin. Neither at rest nor during exercise did opioid antagonism alter plasma lactate and glucose and serum insulin and growth hormone. 4. In conclusion, (1) endogenous opioids are not involved in the responses of blood pressure and heart rate to supine exercise; (2) at rest and during exercise, the endogenous opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropin, aldosterone, cortisol, noradrenaline and adrenaline; (3) they also inhibit the plasma renin-angiotensin II system indirectly via the catecholamines.\r"

  ".U": "88328356\r", 
  ".W": "Primary hyperparathyroidism is a relatively common disease in elderly women. Many of its clinical presentations may be confused with normal aging. Among the elderly, renal dysfunction and skeletal disease, particularly osteoporosis, are the two aspects of the disease likely to cause the most morbidity. It is increasingly apparent, however, that a large group of patients with hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic. When symptoms are present, or repeated serum calcium levels all exceed 11.0 mg/dL, surgery is considered the treatment of choice. Success of surgery and of postoperative recovery are not affected by the age of the patient, but are enhanced by the experience of the surgeon performing the parathyroidectomy. There are difficult management decisions to be made concerning the elderly asymptomatic patient with mild hypercalcemia. A conservative approach to therapy for these individuals would include maintenance of adequate hydration, and involvement in physical activity. Dietary restriction of calcium should be recommended only as long as there is no evidence that it is exacerbating negative calcium balance. Drugs likely to worsen hypercalcemia, such as thiazides, must be avoided, and blood chemistries should be monitored at regular intervals. Because the bone loss of hyperparathyroidism may develop insidiously, serial bone density measurements are probably reasonable in older women already at risk for osteoporosis. Accelerated bone loss is an indication for surgical intervention. A wide variety of medications have been proposed for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, but none stands out as a particularly desirable therapeutic alternative. Future research in this area, particularly with the use of estrogens in postmenopausal women with hyperparathyroidism, may eventually lead to greater acceptance of this alternative to surgery.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of eliminating calories derived from fat sources on postprandial and basal insulin requirements in five patients with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. The patients were studied on a metabolic ward on two solid-food diets with similar quantities of carbohydrate and protein with or without the addition of fat. Diet A was isocaloric (weight maintenance) with calories distributed as 45% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 40% fat. Diet B contained the same carbohydrate and protein content as diet A but was virtually fat free and therefore hypocaloric (1233 +/- 106 vs. 1830 +/- 99 cal, mean +/- SE). The diets were given as five equal meals each day on consecutive days. Insulin requirements and blood glucose measurements were determined by use of the artificial beta-cell. During the study, mean (+/- SE) preprandial blood glucose levels were maintained at 85 +/- 11 mg/dl, and peak postprandial blood glucose levels were less than 180 mg/dl. The elimination of fat calories had no effect on total (68.9 +/- 10.3 vs. 69.3 +/- 4.9 U/day), postprandial (9.8 +/- 3.8 vs. 10.3 +/- 3.7 U/meal), or basal (1.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.2 U/h) insulin requirements. Thus, despite a hypocaloric diet, no change in insulin requirements was noted when fat-derived calories were deleted from the diet. We conclude that fat-derived calories do not alter short-term basal or postprandial insulin requirements in type I diabetes.\r"

The amount of sweetener approximated that in 1 L of sugar-free soft drink. Plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon were measured for 3 h after ingestion of the test beverage. Plasma glucose declined slightly throughout the test period, probably due to fasting, with no differences between the three treatments. Neither sweetener affected peak insulin levels in subjects with or without diabetes. Analysis of area under the curve showed that mean insulin levels were statistically significantly higher after aspartame than after saccharin or unsweetened beverage in normal subjects only, but the magnitude of the difference was small and unlikely to be of physiological importance in the absence of differences in glucose levels. Furthermore, the differences could largely be accounted for by a decrease in insulin values after both unsweetened beverage and saccharin, with no change from baseline after aspartame. Glucagon levels showed time-to-time variation but no overall differences. We conclude that ingestion of aspartame- or saccharin-sweetened beverages by fasting subjects, with or without diabetes, did not affect blood glucose homeostasis.\r"

The addition of sulbactam to ampicillin has no effect on the chemical stability of ampicillin in aqueous solution, and the administration guidelines of the combination are the same as for ampicillin alone. Sulbactam acts primarily by irreversible inactivation of beta-lactamases from most beta-lactamase-producing organisms. The pharmacokinetics of sulbactam are similar to those of ampicillin with an elimination half-life of about one hour in most patients. One difference is that serum and tissue concentrations of sulbactam are usually twice those of ampicillin, at equivalent doses. The sulbactam/ampicillin combination has been approved for the treatment of adults with intraabdominal, skin and skin structure, and gynecological infections due to beta-lactamase-producing bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and species of Klebsiella and Bacteroides. Clinical studies to date have also shown the combination to be effective for the treatment of meningitis, pneumonia, gonorrhea, epiglottis, urinary tract infections, cervical adenitis, and as prophylaxis for abdominal and gynecological surgeries. Many of these studies, however, have included small numbers of patients and/or had design flaws. Adverse effects have been minor with most being attributed to the ampicillin component. Sulbactam/ampicillin compares favorably with other antibiotic regimens in terms of acquisition costs and ease of administration.\r"

It is indicated as adjunctive therapy to dietary control and should be initiated at 20 mg/d in the evening. With higher dosages, twice-daily dosing is preferred, particularly when the dosage reaches the maximum recommended 80 mg/d. Compared with other drugs available, lovastatin has been shown to have good efficacy and a low incidence of side effects. Limited pharmacokinetic information available from the manufacturer reports absorption approximately 30 percent, protein binding greater than 95 percent, and a dual pathway for elimination through both urine (10 percent) and feces (83 percent). The drug has been clinically tested versus placebo and in combination with other cholesterol-lowering drugs. Lovastatin is effective in lowering total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 25-30 percent, with nonfamilial (hypercholesterolemic) patients responding better than those with the familial form of the disease. One percent of lovastatin patients have discontinued therapy because of intolerable side effects. The most common complaints are flatulence and diarrhea; more severe abnormalities include elevation of liver enzymes and an unclear propensity for producing lens opacities. The monthly cost to a patient taking 20 mg/d is approximately $44. Although the drug should be added to hospital formularies, long-term safety experience and competition from other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors will determine lovastatin's final therapeutic role.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have documented potentially adverse effects of diuretics and beta-blocking agents on plasma lipid profiles. This study was designed to establish the effects on lipid profiles of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors lisinopril and enalapril, alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), the calcium-channel blocker nitrendipine, HCTZ, and hydralazine. After a two-week, single-blind, placebo phase, 77 patients with essential hypertension were given active agent as monotherapy in a double-blind fashion for 8-20 weeks. The dose of each agent was titrated to achieve diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. At the end of placebo and treatment phases, plasma was analyzed for triglycerides, total cholesterol, and high-(HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Overall, few changes in lipid contents were noted. Total cholesterol decreased during therapy with hydralazine but increased in patients receiving the combination of lisinopril and HCTZ. HDL cholesterol was depressed in those taking HCTZ alone and in combination with lisinopril. LDL cholesterol was lowered during therapy with hydralazine but was otherwise unaffected by all other agents. None of the agents evaluated significantly affected triglyceride concentrations. Thus, monotherapy with lisinopril, enalapril, and nitrendipine do not affect plasma lipid concentrations. Hydralazine lowers total and LDL cholesterol. If these findings are confirmed in trials with larger numbers of patients, these effects on lipid profiles may influence choice of agent in the therapy of essential hypertension.\r"

It was concluded that the two brands were bioequivalent because of chemical equivalence, use of micronized levothyroxine powder in tablet production with at least one of the brands, and scrupulous attention to quality control during the manufacturing process, all of which contributed to assurance of homogeneity of the products and close adherence (+/- five percent) to the claimed potency.\r"

This pain may be difficult to differentiate from chest pain of cardiac origin. An association between calcium-channel blocking agents and chest pain is speculative at this time. However, the possibility of such an effect should be considered by clinicians in the total management of patients. Future clinical studies are warranted to address the issue of the incidence of such an effect and to define more precisely the potential interrelationship among the calcium-channel antagonists, their efficacy in relieving cardiac pain, and their potential liability in inducing chest pain of noncardiac origin.\r"

Variables analyzed to determine the cost of the therapy included duration of treatment, dosage and number of doses administered, side effects, and laboratory tests. Time and motion studies were also performed and the results included in the algorithm. In two of the three hospitals, the computer-calculated cost of CTZ therapy was significantly less than for T/T therapy ($1194 vs. $1668 and $93 vs $629). In the third hospital there was no significant difference in the costs of the two treatments ($1079 for CTZ vs. $1066 for T/T). The cost of each regimen per patient day followed a similar pattern, with CTZ therapy being significantly less expensive in the same two hospitals. Patients receiving CTZ therapy realized an average cost savings of $29.70 per day at the three institutions. These savings appeared to be due to a reduction in laboratory and administration costs resulting from the decreased frequency of CTZ administration. We conclude that CTZ therapy was less costly than T/T therapy at three geographically different institutions when the cost of supplies, laboratory tests, and personnel time were taken into account.\r"

  ".U": "88328917\r", 
  ".W": "The pathway of renin secretion has been defined in the mouse submandibular gland (SMG). Renin is first synthesized as a prorenin, rapidly cleaved to a one-chain renin, and then very slowly processed to a two-chain form which is stored in mature granules. In pulse-labeling experiments of minced SMG, the swift appearance in the culture medium of radiolabeled one-chain renin, before granule formation, suggested that this form was secreted by a constitutive pathway independent of the granules, possibly directly from the Golgi. Supporting this hypothesis, phenylephrine, which stimulates the secretion of granules, causes a 4-fold increase in the two-chain renin, with little or no effect on the secretion of one-chain renin. Confirming evidence for the existence of the constitutive pathway was provided by the action of monensin, an ionophore that inhibits transport through the Golgi. Monensin inhibited the appearance of radiolabeled newly synthesized renin in the granules and medium while causing accumulation of the newly synthesized one-chain renin in the microsomes. Analysis of secreted renin by Western blot showed that monensin selectively inhibited the secretion of one-chain renin while not affecting the secretion of the stored two-chain renin. Taken together, our data suggest that one-chain renin is primarily secreted soon after synthesis by a pathway that bypasses the granules, while two-chain renin is secreted predominantly from the granules.\r"

  ".W": "Our recent studies demonstrated that the continuous administration of a GnRH agonist (GnRH-Ag; WY 40972) induces abortion in rats by suppressing plasma progesterone (P) levels within 24 h. This fall in P levels is not accompanied by a fall in ovarian venous plasma testosterone (T) or estradiol (E) levels. In this study an attempt was made 1) to determine whether the suppression of P by GnRH-Ag is due to decreased estrogen present in the corpora lutea (CL) and/or a decrease in luteal receptors of E, and 2) to investigate the effects of GnRH-Ag on the nocturnal surges of PRL. Rats were treated continuously on days 7-11 of pregnancy with 5 micrograms/day GnRH-Ag using an osmotic minipump. Ovarian blood samples were obtained on day 8; at autopsy CL were harvested and incubated with medium 199 for 4 h at 37 C under an atmosphere of 95% oxygen-5% carbon-dioxide. Additional rats were killed on day 8 or 10; CL were isolated from the ovary and pooled within the group for the measurement of nuclear and cytosolic E receptors. In other experiments, on days 8, 9, 10, and 11 of pregnancy, blood samples (0.3 ml) were collected via an indwelling intraatrial Silastic cannula at 0330, 0500, or 0600 h for the measurement of PRL and P. While the net synthesis of P by CL in the GnRH-Ag-treated rats decreased to 48 +/- 12 from 224 +/- 47 ng/CL in controls, T and E levels were not different from their respective control values. Steroid levels in ovarian venous plasma reflected a similar response. Nuclear E receptors levels were 82 and 80 in controls and 39 and 41 fmol/mg DNA in the treated group on days 8 and 10, respectively. Nocturnal surges of PRL in plasma were detected at 0330 h in controls as well as in treated rats. However, plasma PRL levels at 0330 h were 101 +/- 24, 120 +/- 22, 196 +/- 40, and 103 +/- 13 ng/ml in controls and 44 +/- 8, 50 +/- 10, 29 +/- 13, and 20 +/- 9 in the GnRH-Ag-treated group on days 8, 9, 10, and 11, respectively. These results suggest that GnRH-Ag has no effect on the ability of the luteal synthesis of T and E and that the antipregnancy effect of GnRH-Ag may be at the level of the CL due to the direct inhibitory effect of GnRH-Ag on the luteal synthesis of P, which, in turn, results in decreased nocturnal surges of PRL and a fall in E receptors in the CL. Alternatively, GnRH-Ag treatment could suppress ovarian or luteal receptors for PRL, which, in turn, lower luteal E receptors, leading to a fall in luteal synthesis and release of P.\r"

Gonadotropes were identified in primary cultures of rat anterior pituitaries by a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. Giga-seal patch clamp recording with the cell-attached configuration was used to monitor membrane currents in these cells. Spontaneous spikes in basal current were seen. These were blocked by methoxyverapamil and probably reflect Ca2+-dependent action potentials. Brief GnRH stimulation induced slow oscillatory changes in membrane current that evolved into a series of large amplitude inward pulses after about 8 min. Treatment with TRH had no effect, and depolarization with K+ led to delayed inward currents without any oscillatory behavior. Under conditions of Ca2+ channel blockade, GnRH stimulation did not induce pulses of inward current, but did lead to oscillatory activation of a small conductance ion channel apparently selective for K+. Taken together these results suggest that GnRH induces oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ and that these oscillations are controlled by biochemical processes.\r"

  ".U": "88328928\r", 
  ".W": "To elucidate the efficacy of continuous vs. intermittent exposure to epinephrine, phenylephrine, and insulin, hepatic glucose production was monitored in isolated perfused rat livers (means +/- SE, n = 6 each). To this end livers of fed rats were perfused with 5 mM glucose Krebs-Ringer buffer in a nonrecirculating system. Using this model it was shown that intermittent exposure (3 min on/off period, dose reduction -50%) to epinephrine (0.4 microM, alpha + beta-agonist) and phenylephrine (5 microM, alpha-agonist) elicited an almost identical rise in hepatic glucose production [epinephrine: 0.72 +/- 0.08 mmol/(86 min X 100 g BW); phenylephrine: 0.68 +/- 0.07 mmol/(86 min X 100 g BW) as their continuous administration (epinephrine: 0.78 +/- 0.06 mmol/(86 min X 100 g BW); phenylephrine: 0.74 +/- 0.09 mmol/(86 min X 100 g BW)]. Inhibition by insulin (100 mU/liter) given either continuously or intermittently (3 min on/off intervals; dose reduction -50%) was equipotent for epinephrine- and phenylephrine-stimulated hepatic glucose production. When the off period was doubled to 6 min, thereby reducing the total insulin dose to 33%, no significant suppression of epinephrine- and phenylephrine-stimulated hepatic glucose production was observed. From this we conclude that 1) the effect on hepatic glucose production of pulsatile (3 min on/off, dose reduction 50%) and continuous administration is equipotent for the respective action of epinephrine, phenylephrine as well as of insulin; and 2) insulin is more effective (P less than 0.02) in inhibiting hepatic glucose production stimulated by an alpha-agonist (phenylephrine; 5.0 microM) than in counteracting alpha + beta-agonist action (epinephrine; 0.4 microM). The characteristics of hepatic glucose release as stimulated by alpha- and/or beta-adrenergic agonists and its inhibition by continuously or intermittently infused insulin were simulated and described by a computer model. Thereby, no qualitative difference could be demonstrated in alpha- vs. beta-adrenergic agonists action on stimulated hepatic glucose production.\r"

Catecholamines measured in aliquots of perfusate samples revealed that in vivo NE release was also pulsatile and was synchronous with LHRH release. Local infusion of NE or methoxamine (an alpha 1-adrenergic stimulant) through a push cannula stimulated LHRH release, while iv injection of prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker) suppressed LHRH release. It is concluded that NE is a possible neurotransmitter stimulating pulsatile LHRH release.\r"

PTH fragments were extracted from cells and purified by reverse phase HPLC. PTH bioactivity and PTH antagonist activity were estimated in a renal cytochemical bioassay. hPTH-(3-84) and hPTH-(8-84) exhibited less than 1% and less than 0.1%, respectively, of the biological activity of synthetic hPTH-(1-84). hPTH-(8-84) had 1% of the PTH inhibitory activity of synthetic [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bovine PTH-(3-34)amide, whereas hPTH-(3-84) was 100 times more active as a PTH inhibitor than the synthetic bovine PTH-(3-34) analog. The latter has so far been recognized as the most potent PTH antagonist in vitro. A 5-fold molar excess of hPTH-(3-84) over hPTH-(1-84) completely blocked the biological action of intact hPTH-(1-84) in the renal cytochemical bioassay. These findings suggest that the carboxyl-terminal portion of the intact hPTH-(1-84) molecule contributes importantly to inhibitor potency.\r"

  ".U": "88328937\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the direct effects of testosterone (T) on LH subunit apoprotein synthesis, glycosylation, and release by the male pituitary. Cells from 1-week castrate rats were cultured for 48 h in steroid-free medium, followed by 48 h in medium with or without 10 nM T. The cells were then incubated for 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 h in medium containing [35S]methionine (35S-Met) or [3H]glucosamine (3H-Gln), with or without 1 nM GnRH (Exp 1) or in medium containing precursors with or without 10 nM T and/or 1 nM GnRH (Exp 2). Radiolabeled precursor incorporation into LH subunits was determined by immunoprecipitation, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In Exp 1, precursor incorporation into total protein (TP) and LH subunits increased linearly over time for at least 8 h. GnRH did not affect precursor incorporation into total protein or 35S-Met labeling of LH subunits, but stimulated a linear time-dependent accumulation of 3H-Gln into total (cells plus media) LH subunits and release of radioimmunoassayable LH into the medium. Based on these results, the effects of T on LH subunit biosynthesis (with or without GnRH) were studied during an 8-h incubation. In Exp 2, GnRH enhanced total 3H-Gln (but not 35S-Met) incorporation into both LH subunits. GnRH stimulated the release of 35S-Met LH alpha and 3H-Gln LH subunits and increased the relative glycosylation of secreted LH subunits without altering the relative glycosylation of intracellular LH subunits. T inhibited radioimmunoassayable LH release and incorporation of both precursors into total and secreted LH subunits (with or without GnRH). However, only the relative glycosylation of secreted LH alpha was reduced by T (with or without GnRH). These data indicate that T acts directly at the pituitary to inhibit LH subunit apoprotein synthesis and selectively inhibit LH alpha glycosylation. Further, these data support the hypothesis that changes in LH glycosylation may be one of the ways by which GnRH and T regulate LH release.\r"

The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of the GVHR on corticosterone, aldosterone, corticotropin (ACTH), Na+, and K+ plasma concentrations in mice. GVHR was induced in irradiated (DBA/2 X B10.D2)F1 mice by transplantation of B10.D2 hemopoietic cells. Controls were untreated F1 mice and irradiated syngeneic (F1) cell-grafted F1 mice. Nonimmunological stimuli transiently increased ACTH and corticosterone plasma levels during the first 5 days, although the early ACTH peak was markedly reduced in GVHR mice. Circulating corticosterone levels returned to normal values thereafter in controls. ACTH returned to basal levels in all mice, even in GVHR mice in spite of their persistent high corticosteronism. The enhancing effect of GVHR on plasma aldosterone concentrations was delayed until day 30 after the cell graft. Results suggest 1) a dissociated effect of GVHR on mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid metabolism and 2) either an alteration of adrenal sensitivity to ACTH in GVHR mice or a possible mimicking of some neuroendocrine activities by the lymphocytes responsible for the onset of the disease.\r"

  ".U": "88328953\r", 
  ".W": "TMB-8 has been used experimentally in many cell types, including endocrine cells, because of its ability to block the efflux of Ca2+ from intracellular stores without affecting influx. Unexpectedly, TMB-8 potentiates stimulated insulin release from pancreatic islets, a process believed to be dependent on the level of cytosolic Ca2+. In the present study, while having no effect on basal insulin release (in the presence of 2.8 mM glucose), TMB-8 (10, 30, and 100 microM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in 45Ca2+ efflux from 45Ca2+-preloaded islets. TMB-8 (100 microM) stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. In the presence of 5.6 mM glucose, TMB-8 (30 and 100 microM) potentiated insulin release and again increased 45Ca2+ efflux in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, insulin release stimulated by isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) was potentiated significantly, and IBMX-stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux was increased by the simultaneous introduction of 30 microM TMB-8. Thus, in pancreatic islets, TMB-8 appears to mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores, rather than inhibit the efflux as has been commonly accepted. In further studies, using insulin-secreting beta-cells of the RINm5F cell line, TMB-8 was shown to increase the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. This confirmed that mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ was occurring in the pancreatic beta-cell in response to TMB-8. Furthermore, a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ of not more than 10 nM (as induced with KCl) was found to mimick the effect of TMB-8 in conjunction with IBMX. No additional effect of TMB-8 to alter Ca2+ handling at the plasma membrane was found when 45Ca2+ uptake experiments were performed. Therefore, the paradoxical mobilization of beta-cell Ca2+ by TMB-8 appears to be a sufficient explanation for its potentiating effect on the rate of insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of truncated glucagon-like peptide-1 [naturally occurring GLP-1; proglucagon-(78-107) amide], a potent insulinotropic peptide from the pig ileum, on endocrine and exocrine secretion of potential gastrointestinal target organs using isolated perfused preparations of the porcine pancreas, antrum, and nonantral part of the stomach. Truncated GLP-1 significantly increased somatostatin secretion from the pancreas at 10(-10) mol/liter and more than doubled the secretion at 10(-9) mol/liter, but had no effect on either somatostatin or gastrin secretion from the antrum or on somatostatin secretion from the nonantral stomach in concentrations up to 10(-8) mol/liter. Insulin secretion from the pancreas (with 7 mmol/liter glucose in the perfusate) increased 2-fold with truncated GLP-1 at 10(-10) mol/liter and almost 5-fold at 10(-9) mol/liter. Pancreatic glucagon secretion was inhibited by 50% at 10(-10) mol/liter and by 70-80% at 10(-9) mol/liter. Full-length GLP-1 [proglucagon-(72-107)] and GLP-2 [proglucagon-(126-159)] had no effect on hormone secretion from any of the perfused organs. It is concluded that truncated GLP-1 may participate in an entero-insular control of pancreatic endocrine secretion.\r"

Na3VO4 (0.2 or 0.5 mg/ml) was administered ad libitum in drinking water. Fed plasma glucose levels (approximately 26 mmol/liter) fell by 30% and 56% after 5 days of treatment with the low (VO.2) and high (VO.5) concentrations of vanadate, respectively. This decrease was not due to a rise in peripheral insulin levels and persisted for more than 2 months. Daily glucosuria was decreased by 60% and 85% in VO.2 and VO.5 rats, respectively. Tolerance of the rats to oral or iv glucose was also considerably improved by vanadate; integrated glucose responses were about 55% and 75% lower in VO.2 and VO.5 rats than in controls, and the differences were not due to restoration of insulin release. Compared to nondiabetic rats, pancreatic insulin reserves amounted to 1% in untreated rats, 3% in VO.2 rats, and 6% in VO.5 rats after 9 weeks of treatment. Liver, but not muscle, glycogen was increased by vanadate. Despite improvement of their diabetic state, vanadate-treated rats did not gain more weight than untreated rats. Their food intake (corrected for urinary glucose losses) was decreased by about 25%. No signs of altered kidney or liver function were observed in rats receiving vanadate. In conclusion, vanadate markedly improves glucose homeostasis in streptozotocin-diabetic rats by an insulin-like mechanism, but does not reproduce the anabolic effects of the hormone.\r"

The present study was an attempt to test whether different stressors address different subclasses of adrenal medullary cells. The adrenal gland of intact male rats was implanted with a dialysis system, and the jugular vein was catheterized. One day after surgery, the adrenal dialysis system was connected to a perfusion pump, and Ringer solution was used for dialysis; dialysate fractions were collected at 15-min intervals, and blood was withdrawn at the end of each fraction period after a 2-h equilibration period. The basal release rates of pituitary PRL and adrenal corticosterone, measured in plasma, and of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and substance P (SP) measured in the adrenal dialysates, were constant during the preshock period. SP concentrations in the blood were below the detection limit of the RIA. Application of mild electric foot shock stress resulted in a marked increase in adrenal catecholamine and SP release. Plasma PRL and corticosterone levels also rose during the time of exposure to foot shock, but plasma SP concentrations remained at undetectable values. In contrast, a metabolic stress i.e. insulin-induced hypoglycemia, did not affect adrenal SP release, although adrenal catecholamine release increased to a larger degree than after foot shock stress. Plasma PRL and corticosterone levels also increased during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. It is concluded that an exogenous stressor (electric foot shock) activates adrenomedullary cells containing catecholamines and SP, whereas these cells are not activated by the stress of insulin-induced hypoglycemia.\r"
