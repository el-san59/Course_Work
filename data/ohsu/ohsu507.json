  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism may suppress the late asthmatic responses to inhaled allergen. Both human and animal studies have suggested that prostanoids may also be involved in increases in airway responsiveness after ozone and allergen. We studied seven atopic subjects, who had a dual asthmatic response to inhaled allergen, during a control period and then after pretreatment with indomethacin (50 mg) or placebo twice daily for 2 days, administered in a randomized, double-blind manner. Indomethacin had no significant effect on the base-line airway responsiveness to histamine (P = 0.22) or the allergen-induced early or late asthmatic response (P = 0.49). However, indomethacin inhibited the increase in airway responsiveness (express as histamine PC20) after allergen inhalation. The log difference in preallergen to postallergen histamine PC20 was 0.49 +/- 0.08 (SE) during the control period, 0.46 +/- 0.08 (SE) after placebo (P = 0.81), and 0.22 +/- 0.10 (SE) after indomethacin (P = 0.02). Although indomethacin is useful for examining the role of cyclooxygenase products in asthmatic responses, it should not be considered in the treatment of asthma. We conclude that cyclooxygenase products are not significant mediators of allergen-induced early or late asthmatic responses but are involved in the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness after allergen inhalation.\r"

An ideal data set was used to determine the error produced in the calculated energy expenditure for each method when specific variables were perturbed. The analysis indicates that some of the calculation methods are more susceptible to perturbations in certain variables than others. Results from an experiment on one adult human subject are used to illustrate the potential for error in actual data. Samples of second void urine, 24-h urine, and breath collected every other day for 21 days are used to calculate the average daily energy expenditure by three calculation methods. The difference between calculated energy expenditure and metabolizable energy on a weight-maintenance diet is used to estimate the error associated with the doubly labeled water method.\r"

Sensitivity for insulin-mediated whole-body glucose uptake was not affected by acute exercise [insulin concentrations eliciting 50% of maximal insulin-mediated glucose uptake being 44 +/- 2 (C) vs. 46 +/- 3 (E) microU/ml] but was decreased after detraining (54 +/- 2 microU/ml, P less than 0.05) to levels comparable to those found in untrained subjects [Am. J. Physiol. 254 (Endocrinol. Metab. 17): E248-E259, 1988]. Near-maximal insulin-mediated glucose uptake (responsiveness) was higher than in untrained subjects and not influenced by acute exercise or detraining [13.4 +/- 1.2 (C), 12.2 +/- 0.9 (E), and 12.2 +/- 0.3 (DT) mg.min-1.kg-1]. Calculated by indirect calorimetry, the glucose-to-glycogen conversion was not influenced by E but was reduced during detraining (P less than 0.05) yet remained higher than previously found in untrained subjects (P less than 0.05). However, only on E days did muscle glycogen increase during insulin infusion. Glycogen synthase activity was increased on E and decreased on DT compared with C days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We chronically instrumented 28 lambs to determine whether phentolamine (alpha-block), propranolol (beta-block), promethazine and cimetidine (H1- and H2-block), high-dose indomethacin, or low- and high-dose meclofenamate (cyclooxygenase block) altered the vasoconstriction. Ethanol alone increased pulmonary vascular resistance from 0.14 to 0.49 Torr.ml-1.kg-1.min (U). Only indomethacin (7-8 mg/kg po) and high-dose meclofenamate (7-8 mg/kg iv) abolished the pulmonary vascular response to ethanol infusion. Pulmonary vascular resistance was 0.14 U after ethanol plus indomethacin and was 0.2 U after ethanol plus high-dose meclofenamate (P = NS vs. base line). Low-dose meclofenamate (2 mg/kg) attenuated the vasoconstrictor response. Systemic vascular resistance increased moderately after ethanol and had a similar pattern of inhibition by cyclooxygenase blockade. Cardiac output and heart rate decreased nearly significantly after ethanol (P less than 0.06), a tendency that was also ablated by cyclooxygenase inhibition. Thus the acute cardiocirculatory response to ethanol involves an intact prostaglandin synthase system in lambs. To our knowledge, these data are the first documentation that cyclooxygenase enzyme blockade can eliminate the acute cardiac and vascular effects of ethanol in a whole-animal system.\r"

Four hours after one-legged knee extensions, a three-step sequential euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp combined with arterial and bilateral femoral vein catheterization was performed. Increased insulin action on glucose uptake was found in the exercised compared with the rested thigh at mean plasma insulin concentrations of 23, 40, and 410 microU/ml. Furthermore, prior contractions directed glucose uptake toward glycogen synthesis and increased insulin effects on thigh O2 consumption and at some insulin concentrations on potassium exchange. In contrast, no change in insulin effects on limb exchange of free fatty acids, glycerol, alanine or tyrosine were found after exercise. Glycogen concentration in rested vastus lateralis muscle did not increase measurably during the clamp even though indirect estimates indicated net glycogen synthesis. In contrast, in exercised muscle estimated and biopsy-verified increases in muscle glycogen concentration agreed. Local contraction-induced increases in insulin sensitivity and responsiveness play an important role in postexercise recovery of human skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Because the natural enrichment of carbohydrate with 13C is greater than that of lipid, we hypothesized that the natural enrichment of exhaled CO2 with 13C (EN) could be used to gauge endogenous substrate utilization in exercising human subjects. To test this, EN and the respiratory exchange ratio (R) which equals the respiratory quotient (RQ) in the steady state, were measured simultaneously in seven subjects. Rest and exercise protocols, performed under conditions of room air (sea level) and hypoxic (inspired O2 fraction = 0.15) breathing, were chosen to cause a variety of patterns of oxidative substrate utilization. Work rates were performed both below and above the subject's lactate threshold (LT). Work above the LT was expected to cause the greatest increase in EN reflecting greater utilization of glucose. There was significant intersubject (P less than 0.05) but not intrasubject variability in resting EN. By 40 min of exercise, EN increased significantly (P less than 0.05) over resting values in all exercise protocols during both room air and hypoxia conditions. In the room air studies, we found no difference in EN during the below-LT work, even though there were significant increases in O2 uptake (VO2). In contrast, above-LT work resulted in significantly greater increases in EN by 20 and 40 min of exercise (P less than 0.05). Contrary to our expectations, we observed no separate effect by hypoxia on the EN during exercise. Both EN and R tended to increase from rest to exercise, but during exercise there was no overall correlation between R and the EN. EN reflects changes in endogenous substrate utilization over relatively long periods of time such as at rest, but delays in the appearance of 13CO2 at the mouth due to dilution in body CO2 pools, and possibly isotopic fractionation, preclude the usefulness of EN as an indicator of endogenous fuel mix during short-term exercise.\r"

Therefore this study was designed to test the hypothesis that static contraction-induced pressor responses, which are enhanced during muscle ischemia, are the result of alterations in muscle oxygenation, acid-base balance, and K+. Thus, in 36 cats, the pressor response, active muscle blood flow, and muscle venous pH, PCO2, PO2, lactate, and K+ were compared during light and intense static contractions with and without arterial occlusion. During light contraction (15-16% of maximal), active muscle blood flow increased without and decreased with arterial occlusion (+35 +/- 12 vs. -60 +/- 11%). Arterial occlusion augmented these pressor responses by 132 +/- 25%. Without arterial occlusion, changes (P less than 0.05) were seen in PO2, O2 content, PCO2, and K+. Lactate and pH were unchanged. With arterial occlusion, changes in muscle PCO2 were augmented and significant changes were seen in pH and lactate. During intense static contraction (67-69% of maximal), muscle blood flow decreased without arterial occlusion (-39 +/- 9%) and decreased further during occlusion (-81 +/- 6%). Arterial occlusion augmented the pressor responses by 39 +/- 12%. All metabolic variables increased during contraction without arterial occlusion, but occlusion failed to augment any of these changes. These data suggest that light static ischemic contractions cause increases in muscle PCO2 and lactate and decreases in pH that may signal compensatory reflex-induced changes in arterial blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We measured the effect of hypoxic hypoxia on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral O2 consumption during normocapnia (arterial PCO2 = 33 +/- 2 Torr) and during hypercapnia (60 +/- 2 Torr) in seven pentobarbital-anesthetized lambs. Analysis of variance showed that neither the magnitude of the hypoxic CBF response nor cerebral O2 consumption was significantly related to the level of arterial PCO2. To determine whether hypoxic cerebral vasodilation during hypercapnia was restricted by reflex sympathetic stimulation we studied an additional six hypercapnic anesthetized lambs before and after bilateral removal of the superior cervical ganglion. Sympathectomy had no effect on base-line CBF during hypercapnia or on the CBF response to hypoxic hypoxia. We conclude that the effects of hypoxic hypoxia on CBF and cerebral O2 consumption are not significantly altered by moderate hypercapnia in the anesthetized lamb. Furthermore, we found no evidence that hypercapnia results in a reflex increase in sympathetic tone that interferes with the ability of cerebral vessels to dilate during hypoxic hypoxia.\r"

At three different levels of end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PETCO2, approximately 35, 41.8, and 44.3 Torr), isocapnic hypoxia was induced for 25 min and after 7 min of breathing 21% O2, isocapnic hypoxia was reinduced for 5 min. Regardless of PETCO2 levels, the ventilatory response to sustained hypoxia was biphasic, characterized by an initial increase (acute hypoxic response, AHR), followed by a decline (hypoxic depression). The biphasic response pattern was due to alteration in tidal volume, which at all CO2 levels decreased significantly (P less than 0.05), without a significant change in breathing frequency. The magnitude of the hypoxic depression, independent of CO2, correlated significantly (r = 0.78, P less than 0.001) with the AHR, but not with the ventilatory response to CO2. The decline of minute ventilation was not significantly affected by PETCO2 [averaged 2.3 +/- 0.6, 3.8 +/- 1.3, and 4.5 +/- 2.2 (SE) 1/min for PETCO2 35, 41.8, and 44.3 Torr, respectively]. This decay was significant for PETCO2 35 and 41.8 Torr but not for 44.3 Torr. The second exposure to hypoxia failed to elicit the same AHR as the first exposure; at all CO2 levels the AHR was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) during the first hypoxic exposure than during the second. We conclude that hypoxia exhibits a long-lasting inhibitory effect on ventilation that is independent of CO2, at least in the range of PETCO2 studied, but is related to hypoxic ventilatory sensitivity.\r"

Appl. Physiol. 62: 756-761, 1987). In the present study, we investigated whether we could prevent or reduce the onset and development of hyperoxic lung injury by sequential instillations of CLSE during the hyperoxic exposure. Rabbits were exposed to 100% O2. CLSE (125 mg, approximately 170 mumol of phospholipid) was suspended in 10 ml of sterile saline and instilled intratracheally into their lungs, starting at 24 h in O2, a time at which no physiological or biochemical injury was detected, and at 24-h intervals thereafter. Control rabbits breathed 100% O2 and received either equal volumes of saline or no instillations at all. CLSE-instilled rabbits had higher arterial PO2 (Pao2) values throughout the exposure period and survived longer when compared with saline controls [120 +/- 4 vs. 102 +/- 4 (SE) h; n greater than or equal to 10; P less than 0.05]. At 72 h in O2, CLSE-instilled rabbits had significantly higher lavageable alveolar phospholipid levels (12.5 +/- 1.5 vs. 5 +/- 1 mumol/kg) and total lung capacities (41 +/- 2 vs. 25 +/- 3.5 ml/kg) and lower levels of alveolar protein (24 +/- 3 vs. 52 +/- 8 mg/kg), minimum surface tension (2 +/- 1 vs. 26.1 dyn/cm), and lung wet-to-dry weights (5.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 6.5 +/- 0.3). After 72 h in O2, lungs from both CLSE- and saline-instilled rabbits showed evidence of diffuse hyperoxic injury. However, atelectasis was less prominent in the former. We concluded that instillation of CLSE limits the onset and development of hyperoxic lung injury to the alveolar epithelium of rabbits.\r"

Stimulus-response curves to increasing minute ventilation with dry gas were generated in animals depleted of tachykinins by capsaicin pretreatment and in animals pretreated with phosphoramidon, a neutral metalloendopeptidase inhibitor. Sixteen anesthetized guinea pigs received capsaicin (50 mg/kg sc) after aminophylline (10 mg/kg ip) and terbutaline (0.1 mg/kg sc). An additional 12 animals received saline (1 ml sc) instead of capsaicin. One week later, all animals were anesthetized, given propranolol (1 mg/kg iv), and mechanically ventilated (6 ml/kg, 60 breaths/min, 50% O2 in air fully water saturated). Phosphoramidon (0.5 mg iv) was administered to five of the noncapsaicin-treated guinea pigs. Eucapnic dry gas (95% O2-5% CO2) hyperpnea \"challenges\" were performed by increasing the tidal volume (2-6 ml) and frequency (150 breaths/min) for 5 min. Capsaicin-pretreated animals showed marked attenuation in HIB, with a rightward shift of the stimulus-response curve compared with controls; the estimated tidal volume required to elicit a twofold increase in respiratory system resistance (ES200) was 5.0 ml for capsaicin-pretreated animals vs. 3.7 ml for controls (P less than 0.03). Phosphoramidon-treated animals were more reactive to dry gas hyperpnea compared with control (ES200 = 2.6 ml; P less than 0.0001). Methacholine dose-response curves (10(-11) to 10(-7) mol iv) obtained at the conclusion of the experiments were similar among capsaicin, phosphoramidon, and control groups. These findings implicate tachykinin release as an important mechanism of HIB in guinea pigs.\r"

The effects of frequency (f) and amplitude of the vibration were investigated in the present study. Eleven anesthetized and paralyzed dogs were placed on a vibrating table (4-32 Hz). O2 was delivered near the tracheal carina at 0.51.kg-1.min-1, while mean airway pressure was kept at 2.4 +/- 0.9 cmH2O. Table vertical displacement (D) and acceleration (a), esophageal (Pes), and tracheal (Ptr) peak-to-peak pressures, and tidal volume (VT) were measured as estimates of the input amplitude applied to the animal. Steady-state arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) and arterial PO2 (PaO2) values were used to monitor overall gas exchange. Typically, eucapnia was achieved with f greater than 16 Hz, D = 1 mm, a = 1 G, Pes = Ptr = 4 +/- 2 cmH2O, and VT less than 2 ml. Inverse exponential relationships were found between PaCO2 and f, a, Pes, and Ptr (exponents: -0.69, -0.38, -0.48, and -0.54, respectively); PaCO2 decreased linearly with increased displacement or VT at a fixed frequency (17 +/- 1 Hz). PaO2 was independent of both f and D (393 +/- 78 Torr, mean +/- SD). These data demonstrate the very small VT, Ptr, and Pes associated with vibration ventilation. It is clear, however, that mechanisms other then those described for conventional ventilation and high-frequency ventilation must be evoked to explain our data. One such possible mechanism is forcing of flow oscillation between lung regions (i.e., forced pendelluft).\r"

  ".W": "Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) parameters [longitudinal relaxation time (T1), transverse relaxation time (T2), and signal intensity] acquired at a magnetic field of 2.35 T were validated with a study of nine different phantom gel solutions. This technique was then applied to study 13 anesthetized supine cats, among which 10 had lung edema induced by oleic acid (0.075 ml/kg); the result was compared with postmortem analyses of lung water. Three animals (series A) were imaged until the edema was first visualized in NMRI, usually 15-20 min after oleic acid infusion. Another seven animals (series B) were imaged over 4-5 h. As lung water increased, so did the signal intensity. When edema first appeared, T1, T2, and the volume of the edematous region within the slice in the upper lobes showed no gravity-dependent differences; this was confirmed by postmortem measurements (series A) of lung water. With time, gravity-dependent regions displayed greater volumes of edematous regions and greater T1 values (P less than 0.01), suggesting a continued accumulation of lung water. In comparison, nondependent regions displayed constant volumes of edematous region and lesser T1 values (P less than 0.01), suggesting an increased protein concentration but no change in lung water. This study suggests the potential applicability of NMRI parameters in the assessment of pulmonary edema.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial hypoxemia has been reported in horses during heavy exercise, but its mechanism has not been determined. With the use of the multiple inert gas elimination technique, we studied five horses, each on two separate occasions, to determine the physiological basis of the hypoxemia that developed during horizontal treadmill exercise at speeds of 4, 10, 12, and 13-14 m/s. Mean, blood temperature-corrected, arterial PO2 fell from 89.4 Torr at rest to 80.7 and 72.1 Torr at 12 and 13-14 m/s, respectively, whereas corresponding PaCO2 values were 40.3, 40.3, and 39.2 Torr. Alveolar-arterial PO2 differences (AaDO2) thus increased from 11.4 Torr at rest to 24.9 and 30.7 Torr at 12 and 13-14 m/s. In 8 of the 10 studies there was no change in ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) relationships with exercise (despite bronchoscopic evidence of airway bleeding in 3) and total shunt was always less than 1% of the cardiac output. Below 10 m/s, the AaDO2 was due only to VA/Q mismatch, but at higher speeds, diffusion limitation of O2 uptake was increasingly evident, accounting for 76% of the AaDO2 at 13-14 m/s. Most of the exercise-induced hypoxemia is thus the result of diffusion limitation with a smaller contribution from VA/Q inequality and essentially none from shunting.\r"

  ".W": "The variations in nasal and pharyngeal resistance induced by changes in the central inspiratory drive were studied in 10 normal men. To calculate resistances we measured upper airway pressures with two low-bias flow catheters; one was placed at the tip of the epiglottis and the other in the posterior nasopharynx, and we measured flow with a Fleisch no. 3 pneumotachograph connected to a tightly fitting mask. Both resistances were obtained continuously during CO2 rebreathing (Read's method) and during the 2 min after a 1-min voluntary maximal hyperventilation. The inspiratory drive was estimated by measurements of inspiratory pressure generated at 0.1 s after the onset of inspiration (P0.1) and by the mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI). In each subject both resistances decreased during CO2 rebreathing; these decreases were correlated with the increase in P0.1. During the posthyperventilation period, ventilation fell below base line in seven subjects; this was accompanied by an increase in both nasal and pharyngeal resistances. These resistances increased exponentially as VT/TI decreased. Parallel changes in nasal and pharyngeal resistances were seen during CO2 stimulus and during the period after the hyperventilation. We conclude that 1) the indexes quantifying the inspiratory drive reflect the activation of nasopharyngeal dilator muscles (as assessed by the changes in upper airway resistance) and 2) both nasal and pharyngeal resistances are similarly influenced by changes in the respiratory drive.\r"

Twenty-four-hour recordings of running activity were used to quantify the number of individual running bouts, their duration and running speed, and the distance run per day. We then established three categories of voluntary running activity based on the mean distance run per day during the last 3 wk of training: low-activity runners averaged 2-5 km/day, medium runners 6-9 km/day, and high runners greater than 11 km/day. Each group demonstrated an intermittent, nocturnal running pattern, at relatively high intensities, with a similar mean running speed for all groups (avg approximately 45 m/min). Differences in total distance run per day were the result of variations in both the number and duration of individual running bouts. Specifically, high runners (n = 7) had 206 +/- 30 individual running bouts per 24 h, each lasting 87 +/- 7 s; medium runners (n = 7) 221 +/- 22 running bouts, lasting 47 +/- 5 s; and low runners (n = 7) 113 +/- 7 bouts, each lasting 40 +/- 7 s. Voluntary running depressed the rate of body weight gain compared with sedentary control rats, despite an increased food and water intake for all runners. Furthermore, drinking activity was temporally associated with running periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The animals were acutely exposed to moderately elevated ambient temperature (27.5 degrees C, 65% relative humidity) for 2 h. O2 and CO2 in the tracheostomy tube were continuously monitored by mass spectrometry using a special sample-hold phase-locked sampling technique. PO2 and PCO2 were determined in blood samples obtained from the carotid artery. During the exposure to heat, central body temperature remained unchanged (38.6 +/- 0.6 degrees C) while all animals rapidly switched to steady shallow panting at frequencies close to the resonant frequency of the respiratory system. During panting, the following values were measured (means +/- SD): breathing frequency, 313 +/- 19 breaths/min; tidal volume, 167 +/- 21 ml; total ventilation, 52 +/- 9 l/min; effective alveolar ventilation, 5.5 +/- 1.3 l/min; PaO2, 106.2 +/- 5.9 Torr; PaCO2, 27.2 +/- 3.9 Torr; end-tidal-arterial PO2 difference [(PE' - Pa)O2], 26.0 +/- 5.3 Torr; and arterial-end-tidal PCO2 difference, [(Pa - PE')CO2], 14.9 +/- 2.5 Torr. On the basis of the classical ideal alveolar air approach, parallel dead-space ventilation accounted for 54% of alveolar ventilation and 66% of the (PE' - Pa)O2 difference. But the steepness of the CO2 and O2 expirogram plotted against expired volume suggested a contribution of series in homogeneity due to incomplete gas mixing.\r"

This method has been criticized for lack of control of minute ventilation (VE) in spontaneously breathing animals, although ethane, which is poorly soluble in tissues, should not be affected by changes in VE. We measured ethane elimination rates in six strain 13 guinea pigs (GP13) during spontaneous room air breathing and in six room air breathing, pentobarbital-anesthetized, tracheostomized, externally warmed, mechanically ventilated GP13s at various levels of VE. In the ventilated animals, weight0.75/VE (metabolic activity corrected for VE) was a linear function of arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) drawn from arterial line (r = 0.72, P less than 0.005). However, weight0.75/VE did not correlate with ethane elimination rates (r = 0.12, not significant). The mean (+/- SD) ethane elimination rates in the spontaneously breathing animals was 3.15 +/- 0.96 pmol.min-1.100 g-1 and was not significantly different from the mean rate in the mechanically ventilated animals (3.11 +/- 1.37) over a range of VE's. These data demonstrate that ethane elimination rates are not affected by changes in VE and are unaffected by pentobarbital anesthesia.\r"

Responses to increases in EEV, induced by imposition of an expiratory threshold load (ETL) of 10 cmH2O, were monitored before and after section of cervical dorsal roots C3-C7. The immediate (first-breath) effect of application of ETL was a prolongation of both TI and expiratory duration (TE). After 10 min of breathing against the ETL, average TI returned to control values but TE remained prolonged. Abolishing feedback from the diaphragm did not affect these responses. When steady-state responses to ETL were compared with those elicited by inhalation of 5-6% CO2 in O2, changes in EEV had, on average, no independent effect on respiratory drive (rate of rise of integrated phrenic activity), although phrenic activity increased greatly in some cats despite little or no change in arterial partial pressure of CO2. These data indicate that diaphragmatic receptors do not contribute to either the immediate (first-breath) or steady-state responses of phrenic motoneurons to increases in EEV in intact cats.\r"

Frequencies from 3 to 30 Hz, VT from 0.4 to 2.0 ml/kg body wt (approximately 20-100% of dead space volume), and Paw from 5 to 20 cmH2O were studied. As expected, both arterial partial pressure of O2 and CO2 (PaO2 and PaCO2, respectively) were found to be related to f and VT. Changing Paw had little effect on blood gas tensions. Similar values of PaO2 and PaCO2 were obtained at many different combinations of f and VT. These relationships collapsed onto a single curve when blood gas tensions were plotted as functions of f multiplied by the square of VT (f. VT2). Simultaneous tracheal and alveolar gas samples showed that the gradient for PO2 and PCO2 increased as f. VT2 decreased, indicating alveolar hypoventilation. However, venous admixture also increased as f. VT2 decreased, suggesting that ventilation-perfusion inequality must also have increased.\r"

During progressive hypercapnia, ventilatory response was incompletely defended with loading (mean unloaded delta VE/delta PCO2 = 3.02 +/- 2.29, loaded = 1.60 +/- 0.67 1.min-1.Torr-1 CO2, where VE is minute ventilation and PCO2 is CO2 partial pressure; P less than 0.01). Furthermore the degree of defense of ventilation with loading was inversely correlated with the magnitude of the unloaded CO2 response. During exercise, loading produced no depression in ventilatory response (mean delta VE/delta VCO2 unloaded = 20.5 +/- 1.9, loaded = 19.2 +/- 2.5 l.min-1.l-1.min-1 CO2 where VCO is CO2 production; P = NS), and no relationship was demonstrated between degree of defense of the exercise ventilatory response and the unloaded CO2 response. Differences in load compensation during CO2 rebreathing and exercise suggest the presence of independent ventilatory control mechanisms in these states. The type of background ventilatory stimulus should therefore be considered in load compensation assessment.\r"

Vesicle intactness and cross-contamination of isolated SR were estimated using a calcium ionophore and mitochondrial and sarcolemmal marker enzymes, respectively. Present findings confirm previously reported fiber-type specific depression in the initial rate and maximum capacity of Ca2+ uptake and altered ATPase activity after exercise. Depression of the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity of the enzyme was evident after greater than or equal to 20 min of exercise in SR isolated from the deep fibers of these muscles. The lowered ATPase activity was followed by a depression in the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake in both muscle homogenates and isolated SR fractions after greater than or equal to 45 min of exercise. Maximum Ca2+ uptake capacity was lower in isolated SR only after exhaustive exercise. Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-sensitive ATPase activity were not affected at any duration of exercise in SR isolated from superficial fibers of these muscles; however, the Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity was increased after 45 min and exhaustive exercise bouts. The alterations in SR function could not be attributed to disrupted vesicles or differential contamination in the SR from exercise groups and were reinforced by similar changes in Ca2+ uptake in crude muscle homogenates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Initial measurements of mucociliary transport rate were obtained in anesthetized ferrets at 30-min intervals for 5.5 h. These rates remained constant at a mean of 18.2 +/- 1.0 (SE) mm/min. We studied the effects of intravenously administered soman (1-8 micrograms/kg) and observed a dose-related change in the rate of mucociliary transport [-1.1 +/- 2.7 (SE) mm/min after 1 microgram/kg, 9.8 +/- 2.9 mm/min after 5 micrograms/kg, and 14.4 +/- 4.3 mm/min after 8 micrograms/kg of soman]. Pretreatment with atropine completely prevented the response to soman, whereas pretreatment with pralidoxime did not significantly alter the response. We postulate that soman's effect on mucociliary transport relates directly to its cholinergic activity. Failure of pralidoxime to inhibit the effects of soman may relate to pralidoxime's inability to reactivate acetylcholinesterase successfully.\r"

The integrated EMG activity of both abdominal (external oblique, internal oblique, rectus abdominis, and transverse abdominis) and thoracic (triangularis sterni, internal intercostal) expiratory muscles increased linearly with increasing PCO2 and PEEP. However, with both hypercapnia and PEEP, the percent increase in abdominal muscle electrical activity exceeded that of thoracic expiratory muscle activity. Both hypercapnia and PEEP increased the tidal shortening of the external oblique and rectus abdominis muscles. Changes in tidal length correlated closely with simultaneous increases in muscle electrical activity. However, during both hypercapnia and PEEP, length changes of the external oblique were significantly greater than those of the rectus abdominis. We conclude that both progressive hypercapnia and PEEP increase the electrical activity of all expiratory muscles and augment their tidal shortening but produce quantitatively different responses in the several expiratory muscles.\r"

Lower dose atropine (4.4 mM) and the M1-muscarinic receptor subtype antagonist pirenzepine (10 mM) also significantly decreased the mean CO2 response slope 48.3 +/- 6.2 and 40.7 +/- 6.0% (SE), respectively, and significantly decreased the maximum response value 26.3 +/- 8.1 and 19.2 +/- 3.2%, respectively, without significant effects on blood pressure or on the phrenic response to carotid sinus nerve stimulation. The M2-muscarinic receptor subtype antagonist AF-DX 116 (10 mM) had no significant effect on phrenic output or blood pressure. Application of carbachol (10 mM) at the rostral area augmented eucapnic phrenic output and the maximum value of the CO2 response but decreased the initial slope, effects blocked by atropine. Carbachol also decreased the response to carotid sinus nerve stimulation, suggesting that the system was saturated by carbachol stimulation. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors accessible to surface application at the rostral ventrolateral medulla antagonized by pirenzepine but not AF-DX 116 appear to be involved in the central chemoreceptor process.\r"

When tone was elevated with U46619, intralobar injections of acetylcholine, bradykinin, nitroglycerin, isoproterenol, epinephrine, and 8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-bromo-cGMP) dilated the pulmonary vascular bed. Intralobar infusions of methylene blue elevated lobar arterial pressure without altering base-line left atrial or aortic pressure, heart rate, or cardiac output. When methylene blue was infused in concentrations that raised lobar arterial pressure to values similar to those attained during U46619 infusion, the pulmonary vasodilator responses to acetylcholine, bradykinin, and nitroglycerin were reduced significantly, whereas vasodilator responses to isoproterenol, epinephrine, and 8-bromo-cGMP were not altered. Moreover, the pressor responses to angiotensin II and BAY K 8644 during U46619 infusion and during methylene blue infusion were similar. The enhancing effects of methylene blue on vascular tone and inhibiting effects of this agent on responses to acetylcholine, bradykinin, and nitroglycerin were reversible. These responses returned to control value when tone was again increased with U46619, 30-45 min after the methylene blue infusion was terminated. The present data are consistent with the hypothesis that cGMP may play a role in the regulation of tone in the feline pulmonary vascular bed and in the mediation of vasodilator responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators, acetylcholine and bradykinin, and to nitrogen oxide-containing vasodilators such as nitroglycerin.\r"

Combined treatment, using all of these approaches, was significantly better than individual treatment.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the role of iron in the intracellular biology of Legionella pneumophila in human monocytes and in the effector arm of cell-mediated immune defense against this intracellular bacterial pathogen. To determine if L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication is iron dependent, we studied the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine on L. pneumophila infection of monocytes. Deferoxamine at 15 microM completely inhibited L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication. The inhibitory effect of deferoxamine was reversed with equimolar iron-saturated transferrin but not apotransferrin. To examine the potential role of iron in monocyte activation, we investigated the influence of iron-saturated transferrin on L. pneumophila multiplication in IFN gamma-activated monocytes. Iron transferrin, but not apotransferrin, neutralized the capacity of activated monocytes to inhibit L. pneumophila multiplication. To explore a potential mechanism by which activated monocytes might limit the availability of intracellular iron, we examined transferrin receptor expression on nonactivated and activated monocytes cultured in vitro for 5 d. By fluorescence-activated flow cytometry, activated monocytes exhibited markedly fewer transferrin receptors than nonactivated monocytes. By Scatchard analysis of 125I-transferrin binding to monocytes, nonactivated monocytes had 38,300 +/- 12,700 (mean +/- SE) transferrin binding sites, whereas activated monocytes had 10,300 +/- 1,600, a reduction of 73%. Activated and nonactivated monocytes had a similar mean Kd (1.8 +/- 0.2 nM). This study demonstrates that (a) L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication is iron dependent; (b) activated monocytes inhibit L. pneumophila multiplication by limiting the availability of intracellular iron; and (c) transferrin receptors are downregulated on IFN gamma-activated monocytes.\r"

Women were examined and cultured for Neisseria gonorrhoeae at 2-wk intervals. Gonococcal isolates were typed according to protein 1 serovar, auxotype, and beta-lactamase plasmid type, and classified as to serovar and strain. The hypothesis was tested by comparing the predictions of the hypothesis with the observations of the study. Over the 14-mo period of the study, major changes in the prevalence of specific serovars were observed in the gonococcal population infecting these women. Women with HIV infection experienced a higher rate of gonococcal infection (0.56 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.04, P less than 0.05, t test) compared with HIV-negative women and were more likely to experience multiple infections with the same strain. The duration of prostitution was inversely related to the frequency of gonococcal infection. Women experiencing an infection with a specific gonococcal serovar were at a 2- to 10-fold reduced risk of reinfection with the same serovar, except for the 1B-1 serovar. The results of the study were consistent with all four predictions of the hypothesis. Infection with a specific gonococcal serovar results in specific but incomplete protection against subsequent infection with the homologous serovar. The mechanism of this protection remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of water and electrolyte homeostasis is multifactorial and includes the heart and kidneys as important regulatory centers. Within the heart, a recently discovered hormone, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), has been implicated in the maintenance of water and salt balance. Primarily found in mammalian atria, ANF has been detected in low amounts in several tissues, including lungs. A disorder of the ANF system has been demonstrated in genetically cardiomyopathic hamsters, a model for human congestive cardiomyopathy. Atrial ANF gene expression and storage are decreased during development of this disease, while paradoxically, circulating levels of ANF are increased. We have hypothesized that an extracardiac source may contribute to ANF production in these pathological conditions. In this paper we provide evidence that ANF synthesis is stimulated in the lungs of hamsters during development of cardiomyopathy as revealed by increased ANF mRNA and peptide levels. Furthermore, we show that ANF synthesized in lungs is secreted and has identical chromatographic and biological properties to circulating ANF. The increased production of ANF in lungs may be physiologically important in preventing pulmonary edema. Alternatively, during cardiac dysfunction, lungs may play a compensatory role by increasing their contribution to plasma ANF levels.\r"

Using [3H]proline-labeled cells we found that IFN-gamma resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of fibroblast collagen synthesis. Pulse-chase experiments to analyze compartmentalization of newly synthesized collagen showed that the decrease in collagen synthesis was confined to the soluble pool of procollagen in the medium, while extracellular matrix associated collagen was not changed, indicating that a larger proportion of newly synthesized collagen was deposited into the matrix in IFN-gamma exposed fibroblasts (34.2 vs. 25.3%). This increase in the efficiency of collagen matrix deposition was associated with enhanced expression of a cell surface receptor for collagen as detected by indirect immunofluorescence labeling and analysis by flow cytometry. Fibroblasts (IMR-90) cultured in the presence of IFN-gamma (1,000 U/ml) exhibited a twofold increase in mean linear fluorescence intensity compared with cells cultured under control conditions. The distribution of log fluorescence intensity in both control and IFN-gamma exposed cells was normally distributed about the mean, indicating that discrete subpopulations with respect to receptor expression were not present. Increased fluorescence intensity and log normal distribution of fluorescence intensity also were identified in IFN-gamma-treated lung fibroblasts from a normal adult individual and two strains obtained from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. These results indicate that IFN-gamma modulates fibroblast collagen matrix deposition as well as collagen synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Native GRH[GRH(1-44)-NH2 and GRH(1-40)-OH], and COOH-terminally shortened fragments [GRH(1-32)-NH2 and GRH(1-29)-NH2] were rapidly cleaved, while GRH(2-32)-NH2 was not degraded at this site. Moreover, degradation to GRH(3-44)-NH2 was unaffected by an aminopeptidase inhibitor, indicating that this metabolite was generated from a single step cleavage by a dipeptidylpeptidase (DPP) rather than sequential aminopeptidase cleavages. Conversion to GRH(3-44)-NH2 was blocked by diprotin A, a DPP type IV (DPP IV) competitive inhibitor. D-Amino acid substitution at either position 1 or 2 also prevented hydrolysis, characteristic of DPP IV. Analysis of endogenous plasma GRH immunoreactivity from a human GRH transgenic pig revealed that the major peak coeluted with GRH(3-44)-NH2. Native GRH exhibited trypsin-like degradation at the 11-12 position but cleavage at the 12-13 site occurred only with GRH(1-32)-NH2 and GRH(1-29)-NH2. Formation of these metabolites was independent of prior DPP IV hydrolysis but was greatly reduced by trypsin inhibitors. Evaluation of plasma stability of potential GRH super analogues, designed to resist degradation by these enzymes, confirmed that GRH degradation in plasma occurs primarily by DPP IV, and to a lesser extent by trypsin-like enzyme(s).\r"

The gene is induced within 6 h by either cytokine, and its accumulation is observed upon induction with rIFN-gamma up to 5 d. The combined effect of the two cytokines is more than additive. rIFN-gamma also induces accumulation of X-CGD mRNA in immature myeloid cells from peripheral blood of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients, whereas rTNF has almost no effect. The cells from CML patients constitutively express TNF mRNA, suggesting that endogenously produced TNF may play a role in the effect of rIFN-gamma on these cells. rTNF induces X-CGD gene expression in the myeloid cell lines acting, at least in part, at the transcriptional level, as shown in nuclear run-on experiments. The gene encoding the 22-kD light chain of cytochrome b-245 is constitutively expressed in the human myeloid cell lines and the accumulation of its transcripts is affected by neither rTNF nor rIFN-gamma, rTNF and rIFN-gamma synergistically to induce the cell lines to express the cytochrome b-245 heterodimer (as evaluated by its visible spectrum), and to produce NADPH oxidase activity and H2O2 upon stimulation with phorbol diesters.\r"

The two structural defects in the mutant gamma chain may well perturb the conformation required for fibrin monomer polymerization that is specifically assigned to the D domain of fibrinogen. This alteration also seems to affect the intermolecular gamma chain cross-linking of fibrin and fibrinogen, although the amine acceptor gamma glutamine-398 was found to function normally. These functional abnormalities may well be related to posttraumatic hemorrhage as observed in a 33-yr-old man with moderate hemorrhagic diathesis related to injuries since his early adolescence. The structure of the extra carbohydrate moiety attached to asparagine-308 was found to be identical with those derived from the normal B beta and gamma chains as evidenced by HPLC.\r"

Southern blot hybridization analysis with human alpha 2PI cDNA and genomic DNA probes demonstrated no gross deletion or rearrangement of the gene. By sequencing all the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of the gene of a homozygote, we identified a single cytidine nucleotide insertion in the exon coding for the carboxyl-terminal region. This frameshift mutation leads to an alteration and elongation of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the deduced amino acid sequence. Synthetic oligonucleotide probes confirmed this frameshift mutation in all the affected family members including both heterozygous parents. In a transient expression assay, the alpha 2PI level in the culture medium of the cells transfected with the mutated alpha 2PI expression vector was very low and only 4% of that of the cells transfected with the normal vector, although the transcript levels and the cellular contents of alpha 2PIs did not differ significantly. Elongation of amino acid sequence in the mutant alpha 2PI was confirmed by an analysis of alpha 2PI in a transient expression experiment. These data indicate that this mutation is the cause of alpha 2PI deficiency in this pedigree.\r"

Only two isoforms of MB creatine kinase have been detected in plasma leading to speculation that the COOH-terminal lysine on the B subunit is resistant to hydrolysis. To define the biochemical changes resulting in MB creatine kinase isoform conversion, we incubated highly purified MB creatine kinase from canine myocardium with plasma carboxypeptidase N. Quantitative anion-exchange chromatography of incubation mixtures and serial plasma samples from dogs subjected to coronary occlusion revealed a second, more acidic form evolved with time that was separated from the tissue isoform. Cyanogen bromide digestion of the two isoforms followed by amino acid sequencing of COOH-terminal peptides showed that MB creatine kinase undergoes removal of the COOH-terminal lysine residue from both M and B subunits. An intermediate form lacking lysine on the M subunit was delineated during incubations by the combined use of anion-exchange chromatography and conventional electrophoretic techniques. Thus, sequential cleavage of lysine from subunits of MB creatine kinase produces an intermediate isoform that has not been detected previously because of difficulties separating it from the tissue and fully converted isoforms.\r"

  ".U": "89214700\r", 
  ".W": "The capacity of interferon-gamma to regulate the generation and release of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) from human alveolar macrophages of normal nonsmoking individuals was evaluated. When alveolar macrophages were incubated for 60 min with heat aggregated IgG (HAIgG), they generated and released 5.7 +/- 1.7 ng of LT B4 per 10(6) cells compared to 1.9 +/- 0.4 ng from cells incubated with buffer alone, P = 0.02. When alveolar macrophages were preincubated with interferon-gamma for 24 h before activation for 60 min with heat-aggregated IgG, the soluble IgG aggregates became a significantly more effective stimulus for LTB4 release, 17.0 +/- 3.9 ng/10(6) cells, P = 0.001, compared to cells incubated in the absence of interferon-gamma and challenged with HAIgG. Interferon-gamma did not alter the response to A23187. This effect of interferon-gamma was both time and dose dependent; it also was specific since neither interferon-alpha nor interferon-beta had a regulatory effect on the release of LTB4 from cells in response to challenge with HAIgG. Preincubation of the alveolar macrophages with interferon-gamma augmented the density of IgG1 receptors by 81.5 +/- 17.3%; neither interferon-alpha nor interferon-beta effected this parameter. Furthermore, monomeric IgG1 blocked HAIgG induced LTB4 release from alveolar macrophages primed with interferon-gamma. Therefore, at least one of the mechanisms by which interferon-gamma primes alveolar macrophages for the production and release of LTB4 in response to stimulation by aggregates of IgG is that of increasing the number of receptors for this stimulus.\r"

Euglobulin clot lysis was abnormally shortened (50 min) and normalized in vitro with epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA). The patient was treated with EACA with prompt cessation of bleeding. Patient tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) levels in serum were normal (4.7 ng/ml, control 3.5-7.2) as detected by a two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Patient fibrinolytic inhibitor activities were assessed by incubating 125I-labeled t-PA with either whole blood or serum followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to identify the resultant protease/protease inhibitor complexes. In comparison to blood samples obtained from normal donors, patient plasma and serum demonstrated reduced binding of a fast-acting plasminogen activator inhibitor to 125I-labeled t-PA. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated diminished complex formation between type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) in patient serum and 125I-labeled t-PA. Low patient PAI-1 activity was confirmed in serum (0.36 U/ml, control 0.87-1.81; n = 3) and in platelet lysates using a functional IRMA to quantitate PAI-1 binding to immobilized t-PA. However, patient serum PAI-1 antigen was within the normal range when analyzed by IRMA (31.8 ng/ml, control 19.6-42.2); this result was confirmed in both serum and platelets by Western blot (n = 3).

  ".W": "The protein encoded by the protooncogene c-jun, included in the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex, is probably the critical trans-acting factor controlling transcription of the procollagenase gene which is rate limiting for subsequent synthesis of procollagenase. Therefore, to elucidate possible mechanisms whereby IL-1 stimulates procollagenase synthesis, we measured levels of c-jun and procollagenase mRNA in human serum-starved dermal fibroblasts in response to human recombinant IL-1 beta (hrIL-1 beta). hrIL-1 beta or serum induced rapid increases in c-jun mRNA levels; mRNA levels declined rapidly after hrIL-1 beta and more slowly after exposure to serum. The increases in levels of c-jun mRNA preceded the increases in procollagenase mRNA. Whereas the increases in levels of procollagenase mRNA were blunted by cycloheximide, those of c-jun mRNA were enhanced. We interpret these results as follows: IL-1 or serum induce transcription of c-jun by mechanisms independent of new protein synthesis; c-JUN, the protein product of c-jun in the AP-1 complex, is an essential mediator of the effects of IL-1 or serum in the subsequent induction of expression of the procollagenase gene.\r"

Despite treatment of the bronchospasm and readministration of the same dose of phenoxymethyl penicillin, wheezing recurred requiring stopping the desensitization procedure. Aztreonam, a monobactam antibiotic with activity against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, was administered along with an aminoglycoside. The patient tolerated a full course of aztreonam with no adverse reactions. This case report supports previous in vitro and in vivo studies, suggesting that aztreonam does not cross-react with penicillin-specific antibodies and that it may be well tolerated in beta-lactam-allergic individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Antibody reactive with the CD3 complex on the surface of T lymphocytes can either: inhibit CTL lysis of target cells expressing Ag; or redirect CTL to lyse target cells expressing FcR in the absence of Ag expression. To investigate these phenomena we examined the effect of anti-CD3 mAb on two indicators of CTL activation, the release of esterase and target cell lysis. Esterase release by long term allo-reactive human CTL in response to target cells (JY or HLA transfected K562 cells) was found to be Ag specific and correlate with target cell lysis. Addition of anti-CD3 to either JY targets or K562 cells expressing FcR resulted in a high level of esterase release. Triggering of esterase release was found with both soluble intact and Fab fragment of anti-CD3 in the absence of cells expressing measurable FcR. This apparent FcR-independent triggering of esterase release occurred at 37 degrees C but not at 24 degrees C. In contrast esterase activity was released from CTL at both 24 and 37 degrees C in response to intact target cells, JY or K562 cells plus intact anti-CD3 mAb. Addition of anti-CD3 mAb, at a level capable of blocking target cell lysis by greater than 50%, resulted in an initial velocity of esterase release almost twice that found in response to JY target cells. With a low level of anti-CD3 mAb, able to block JY lysis by approximately 10%, the initial rate of esterase release was much slower than that found in response to target cells. In contrast when FcR+ cells, K562, were added along with a low level of anti-CD3 the initial velocity of esterase release was about twofold more than the velocity of esterase release triggered by soluble anti-CD3 alone. These results indicate that soluble antibody can trigger long term active CTL and the velocity of this triggering correlates with anti-CD3-mediated inhibition as well as redirected lysis.\r"

Hybridomas made from the spleens of these animals were evaluated for clonality and donor origin and a panel of 146 independent hybridomas were subsequently examined for VH expression. Hybridomas derived from the spleens of SCID mice reconstituted with fresh cells, used as a control, utilized VH families in proportion to their numerical representation in the genome. However, hybridomas from the spleens of mice reconstituted with long term cultured cells utilized a predominance of the two VH gene families most proximal to JH, characteristic of cells early in B lymphocyte development. Coinjection of thymocytes with cultured fetal liver cells, to provide good levels of T lymphocytes, did not alter this pattern of VH utilization. Irradiation (3 Gy) of the mice before cultured cell injection, which leads to more complete reconstitution of the B cell compartment, was effective in removing this bias in the VH repertoire. Hybridomas derived from these mice expressed their VH genes more in proportion to family size, characteristic of cells later in B lymphocyte development. In this manner, long term lymphoid-cultured cells can be used to study the transitions that occur in VH repertoire expression which appear to be mediated by either B lymphocyte developmental microenvironment or population size.\r"

Analysis of AKXD and BXD recombinant inbred strains showed that Mls-2a (formerly Mlsc) was not the product of a single gene and suggested that at least two non-H-2 genes control V beta 3 levels. Studies of the progeny of a B10.BR x (C3H/HeJ x B10.BR)F1 backcross confirmed the existence of two V beta 3+ T cell deleting genes: one unlinked and one linked to Ly-7, which we propose be called Mls-2 and Mls-3, respectively. Mls-2a induces partial deletion of V beta 3+ T cells with a bias toward deleting CD4+ cells. It stimulates V beta 3+ hybrids and may be linked to Mtv-13 on chromosome 4. A third non-H-2 gene is implicated in enhancing the presentation of Mls-2a. Mls-3a causes elimination of all V beta 3+ T cells in H-2k and H-2d mice but poorly stimulates V beta 3+ hybrids.\r"

All rat constant regions could be expressed and m.w. were as expected from the protein sequence. A slight variation in mobility within the IgG subclasses allowed us to establish a hierarchy for the sizes of the four gamma H chains; gamma 2b greater than gamma 1 greater than gamma 2c greater than gamma 2a. Rat IgG2c and IgG2b could be purified on both protein A and protein G while rat IgG2a could only be purified on protein G. Rat IgM and IgG2b were the most potent in C-mediated hemolysis. This was not simply a consequence of the amount of C1q bound because IgG2c bound C1q efficiently but was relatively poor in cell lysis. In ADCC using human effector and target cells, IgG2b and IgG1 were the most effective.\r"

The data emphasize the overwhelming selection of the HumKv325/VkIIIb L chain for this family of autoantibodies. The few amino acid substitutions found within the VL regions were mainly concentrated in the complementarity-determining region 1. JK and CK genes did not show the same pattern of restriction. There is a good correlation between the amino acid sequence and the presence of the kIIIb marker. The idiotypic marker PSL2 was present in 34 out of 35 kIIIb L chains analyzed (97%) and the PSL3 in 27 (80%). Moreover, the hydrophilicity and antigenic profiles of these L chains corroborate the presence of the epitopes detected by the anti-CRI. These results demonstrate a restricted selection of the Vk genes used by a family of self reacting proteins, and an unusual evolutionary conservation of the idiotypic structure that may be involved in the network regulation.\r"

Because the cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils serve as an intracellular store of receptors and NADPH oxidase components, we investigated the subcellular distribution of substrates for ADP-ribosylation by both pertussis and cholera toxins. Cholera toxin substrates of Mr 43 and 52 kDa were present only in the plasma membrane fraction. A 39-kDa pertussis toxin substrate was present in the plasma membrane, cytosol, and a specific granule-enriched fraction. There were no substrates for either toxin in the primary granules. Quantitative GTP-gamma-5 binding was localized predominantly to the plasma membrane fraction (47%), but significant portions were found in the specific granule-enriched fractions (13%) and cytosol (34%) as well. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and chymotryptic digests of the pertussis toxin substrate from these three subcellular fractions suggested that they are highly homologous. Triton X-114 phase partitioning was used to investigate the hydrophobicity of the toxin substrates. The pertussis toxin substrates in the plasma membrane and granule fractions behaved like integral membrane proteins, whereas the cytosolic substrate partitioned into both lipophilic and aqueous fractions. ADP-ribosylation converted the substrates to a somewhat less lipophilic form. These data suggest that the specific granules or an organelle of similar density serve as an intracellular store of a G protein with a 39-kDa alpha-subunit and that the cytosolic fraction of neutrophils contains free alpha-subunits of the same size.\r"

  ".W": "Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast-form fungus which causes pulmonary and meningeal infections preferentially in the immunocompromised host. It is thought that cell-mediated immunity is important for acquired resistance against cryptococcosis with activated macrophages as the final effector cells. However, specific polysaccharides in the capsule of C. neoformans protect the fungus from adherence to phagocytes and from subsequent phagocytosis. We have studied extracellular killing of C. neoformans by IFN-gamma-activated macrophages and their products. Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated with rIFN-gamma for 24 h were able to effectively suppress the growth of C. neoformans and the effect of IFN-gamma was augmented by LPS. Killing of C. neoformans was also achieved by cell-free supernatants from bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated with IFN-gamma plus LPS. Our results indicate that killing of C. neoformans by activated macrophages is independent from toxic oxygen radicals and mediated by secreted protein(s) of apparent molecular mass of 15 and 30 kDa. These findings indicate that activated macrophages play a major role in host defense, although the fungus resists phagocytosis and remains in the extracellular milieu.\r"

Although both types of lesion contained equal percentages of T lymphocytes, the T cell subset distribution was different. For vigorous lesions, the ratio of helper/effector to suppressor/cytotoxic T cells was 2 to 3:1. For modulated lesions the ratio was lower (1:1). Differences in the phenotypic profiles of vigorous and modulated granuloma (Gr) T cells were reflected in their functional activity. Vigorous Gr T cells were more active in lymphoproliferation, IL-2 production, and granuloma formation than those from modulated lesions. Moreover, modulated Gr T cells suppressed the functional activity of vigorous Gr T cells in a dose-dependent manner. The selective depletion of T cell subsets showed that phenotypically, the Gr delayed-hypersensitivity T cell is L3T4+, Lyt-1+ whereas the Gr Ts cell is an Lyt-2+ lymphocyte. Both of these T cell subsets are present in vigorous and modulated lesions. During acute infection, delayed-hypersensitivity T cell lymphocyte functions predominate, whereas Ts lymphocyte functions appear to prevail during chronic infection.\r"

  ".W": "After peroral infection with cysts of Toxoplasma gondii, C57BL/6 mice died and A/J mice survived. To better understand the reasons for this difference in survival, host defenses during acute infection were studied: initial portal of entry of T. gondii contributed to susceptibility as more C57BL/6 mice survived after i.p. than peroral infection (p less than 0.001). Susceptible (C57BL/6) mice had more necrosis and inflammation in their brains, livers, and mesenteric lymph nodes than resistant (A/J) mice. Susceptible mice had less IgM antibody to T. gondii (p less than 0.0005) than resistant mice 7 days after infection, but amounts of IgG antibody to T. gondii were similar. Infection reduced percentages of spleen cells with the Lyt-2+ phenotype in susceptible (p less than 0.02) but not resistant mice; infection decreased percentages of spleen cells with the L3T4+ phenotype similarly in both strains of mice. Spleen cells from infected susceptible mice had greater depression in their blastogenic response to Con A (p less than 0.05) and produced significantly more IFN-gamma in culture with (p = 0.009) or without (p less than 0.05) Toxoplasma Ag than spleen cells from infected resistant mice. Infection increased serum levels of IFN-gamma substantially in susceptible but not resistant mice. Lymphocyte IL-2 production was similar in both groups of mice. Peritoneal macrophages from both strains of mice became activated to inhibit or kill T. gondii by 7 days after infection, but Kupffer cells became activated only in susceptible mice. These results indicate that increased resistance to peroral Toxoplasma infection is likely to be mediated by a number of immune responses acting together. They suggest that increased susceptibility may result from inadequately regulated inflammatory responses that increase tissue destruction.\r"

An additional mammalian tachykinin, neurokinin B, has also been described. SP and possibly other tachykinins may modulate immunologic responses. Granulomas that form around parasite ova in murine schistosomiasis were examined for tachykinins. Tachykinins were extracted from granulomas by boiling or with detergent. Extracts examined by RIA and HPLC contained only immunoreactive SP. Granulomas were dispersed with collagenase and cultured in vitro for up to 4 h. Only immunoreactive SP appeared in the culture medium. SP immunoreactivity localized solely to granuloma eosinophils as demonstrated by a sensitive immunohistochemical technique. An antiserum that recognized SK, neuropeptide K, and neurokinin B, but which possessed low reactivity to SP, also stained these cells. Only prior absorption of each antiserum with the appropriate synthetic neuropeptide would abrogate the immunostaining. This suggested that tachykinins other than SP were present within these cells. However, results of in situ hybridization experiments intimated that eosinophils produced predominantly preprotachykinin mRNAs which encode SP but are devoid of the SK/neuropeptide K sequence. It is concluded that granuloma eosinophils make predominantly SP in deference to other tachykinins, and that tachykinins other than SP are unlikely to be important in the regulation of the early granulomatous response of murine schistosomiasis.\r"

Levels of induced gene expression in the human T cell line Jurkat were determined by mRNA blotting and nuclear run-on assay, after stimulation with one or combinations of the mitogens PMA, PHA, and the ionophore A23187. In the presence of CSA, gene expression induced with PMA alone was not inhibited, whereas PHA-induced increases in gene expression were inhibited by CSA. For one group of genes, including IL-2 and two novel genes with sequences suggestive of lymphokines, A23187 plus PMA-induced gene expression was inhibited by CSA. In contrast, another group of induced genes was unaffected by CSA after A23187 and PMA induction. This finding implies that A23187 and PMA stimulate gene induction by more than one mechanism, and that not all activation signals mediated through calcium fluxes are sensitive to CSA. In addition, 8 of the 11 genes were expressed in the fibroblast cell line Mrc 5 after stimulation with PMA, A23187, or serum; CSA had no effect on genes induced with these agents in Mrc 5 cells in both mRNA blotting and run-on experiments, although 5 of these genes were markedly inhibited by CSA in Jurkat after PMA/PHA induction. These data indicate that separate pathways for induction of identical genes exist, and that the inciting stimulus and cell type are determining factors in the ability of CSA to inhibit gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Our laboratory previously reported that there was restriction fragment length polymorphism of TCR C beta genes in rabbits. EcoRI digests of DNA from different rabbits gave fragments of 9 and 6 kb (C beta a) or 14 and 6 kb (C beta b) that hybridized to a C beta cDNA probe. We also reported that the 9- and 14-kb types segregated as Mendelian traits and that there were allotypic differences in the first exon of the C beta 1 genes of C beta a and C beta b animals. Here we report the DNA sequence of the C beta 2 gene present in the 6-kb EcoRI fragment from a C beta b animal and compare the exon sequences with that of a cDNA from a C beta a animal. We find replacement changes in the first and third exons that probably represent allotypic forms of the rabbit C beta 2 gene. The genomic DNA 5' of exon 1 of both beta 1 and beta 2 contain alternating purine/pyrimidine repeat sequences. The genomic C beta 2 has an open reading frame of 69 amino acids in frame with exon 1 similar to a longer one previously found 5' of exon 1 of C beta 1. Further 5' of this region, rabbit C beta 1 and C beta 2 DNA sequences are only about 66% similar. Both the C beta 1 and C beta 2 sequences have two chi sequences; one in exon 1 with a perfect match and one in the intron downstream of exon 1 with one mismatch. Alternating purine/pyrimidine repeats and chi sequences found in rabbit C beta 1 and C beta 2 genes may have contributed to process(es) of gene duplication and/or conversion.\r"

  ".W": "Rearrangement of the TCR-delta gene was studied using J delta, C delta, and V delta probes in 61 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and several cases of chronic lymphoid neoplasms to define the specificity and the diversity of rearrangements occurring at the delta locus. TCR-delta rearrangements or deletions were found in all T (33 cases) and B lineage (28 cases) ALL but not in any case of B cell chronic proliferations (13 cases). The restriction patterns of rearrangement were clearly distinct between T and B ALL and use of one V delta probe showed that rearrangement of the V delta IDP2 gene segment which is also productively rearranged in the Peer cell line, occurred frequently in T-ALL but never in B lineage ALL. Studies of WT31 and delta TCS1 antibody reactivity showed that at least 4 of 13 CD3+ T-ALL cases expressed the delta protein. CD4 and/or CD8 Ag expression were observed in some of the gamma delta expressing T-ALL. These data show that particular TCR-delta gene rearrangements occur in neoplastic early B cells and that the combinatorial diversity of TCR-delta rearrangements in T cells is higher than initially expected. In addition this study shows that an important proportion of CD3 positive T-ALL cases express the gamma delta heterodimer.\r"

  ".W": "We have determined the organization and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the human T cell surface glycoprotein CD8 alpha. This gene spans approximately 8 kb and is organized into six exons which encode separate functional domains of the protein. Exon 1 encodes the 5' untranslated region and leader peptide, exon II the Ig V-like region, exon III the hinge-like region, exon IV the transmembrane domain, and exons V and VI the cytoplasmic tail. Alternative splicing that excludes nucleotide sequences from exon IV results in a transcript which encodes a secreted form of the protein. This transcript accounts for approximately 15% of the total CD8 alpha mRNA in human T cell leukemia lines and in normal human tissues. Secreted CD8 alpha protein can be detected in culture supernatants of T cell leukemia lines and PHA-stimulated PBMC by immunoprecipitation with the anti-CD8 alpha mAb OKT8 or with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum specific for the 28 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of CD8 alpha. The secreted CD8 alpha protein forms homodimers; when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 27 or 54 kDa under reducing or non-reducing conditions, respectively. Human secreted CD8 alpha may serve an immunoregulatory role for the interactions of T cells with their targets in vivo.\r"

IFN-gamma production was altered in patients at late CDC stage III (WR 4-5) and CDC IV (WR 6). A strong correlation between the disappearance of antibodies to core proteins and low IFN-alpha level was observed. IFN-alpha levels were significantly diminished in patients positive for HIV antigen. Reduced IFN-alpha production paralleled the HIV-1-related depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes and might serve as an additional parameter in defining the stage of HIV-1 infection.\r"

Monthly surveillance of gonococcal isolates showed the prevalence of gonococci with high-level, plasmid-mediated tetracycline resistance (TRNG) to be about 15% for three consecutive 6-mo periods. Over the same period, the prevalence of gonococci with chromosomally mediated resistance to penicillin G steadily increased, from 0% to 9% and then to 21%. From April to July 1987, while chromosomally mediated penicillin resistance was rapidly increasing, a more intensive study was conducted. Patients infected with TRNG reported significantly more lifetime sexual partners (P less than .05) but otherwise resembled patients infected with antibiotic-sensitive gonococci. Patients infected with chromosomally mediated penicillin-resistant gonococci differed from other patients. In addition to reporting more lifetime partners (P less than .05), patients with chromosomally mediated penicillin-resistant gonorrhea were more likely to be older (P less than .05) and more often reported past episodes of gonorrhea (P less than .05), greater numbers of recent sexual partners (P less than .05), new sexual partners (P less than .05), prostitute contact (P = .06), and parenteral drug use or sexual partners who were drug users (P = .07). The introduction of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae into communities may be attributable to a subset of patients who practice \"risky behaviors\" and who could be targeted for disease intervention activities.\r"

Neutrophil autooxidation during exposure to FMLP was also decreased by both antibiotics. The antimicrobial agents did not scavenge superoxide. Likewise, the interactions of [3H]FMLP with specific receptors on neutrophils, FMLP-activated degranulation and intracellular calcium fluxes, the activity of cytosolic protein kinase C and the release of [3H]arachidonate from calcium ionophore-stimulated neutrophils were all unaffected by the antibiotics. Erythromycin and roxithromycin in particular appear to enhance neutrophil migration by an antioxidant mechanism that is not due to inhibition of transductional events involved in the activation of NADPH-oxidase or to oxidant scavenging properties.\r"

The addition of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or luteinizing hormone (LH) alone significantly increased the rate of development of inseminated oocytes to two-cell embryos, resulting in a twofold increase in blastocyst development. There was no significant difference between FSH and LH supplementation. However, the beneficial effect of FSH or LH was abolished when both were added together. Next, we tested the effect of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) supplementation of the embryo culture medium. The addition of 10 microM EDTA significantly enhanced the development of embryos derived from oocytes matured in vitro, both to two-cell embryos and to blastocysts. These data suggest that the inadequate development of embryos from oocytes matured in vitro results from a defect similar to that inherent in outbred mouse embryos showing the two-cell block in vitro.\r"

This study was conducted to compare hospital charges and lengths of stay for two groups of patients: one cared for by a resident team and the other cared for by attending physicians. The study was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital in Portland, Oregon. An initial group of 5,451 admissions was examined, considering type of doctor (resident or attending), severity of illness, and patient demographic characteristics. A regression analysis revealed that total charges were similar in the two groups, but only 14% of the variance in log total charges was explained. A subgroup of 1,058 admissions in the eight most common diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) was further evaluated. In this analysis total charges for the resident patient group were 52% higher than charges for the patient group cared for by attending physicians. Forty-one per cent of the variance was explained, with type of doctor and severity of illness accounting for 5% and 10%, respectively. Further examination of one DRG indicated that additional factors not included in previous studies, such as extent of preadmission evaluation, ethical factors influencing treatment options, and patient expectations for care, may be important determinants of hospital charges. This study demonstrates that the high cost of resident care is not fully explained by currently available measures.\r"

Because quinidine has been reported recently to be a potent inhibitor of the enzyme responsible for this polymorphism (cytochrome P450db1), we tested the hypothesis that quinidine would selectively inhibit encainide metabolism and alter its effects in subjects with the extensive metabolism phenotype for debrisoquine oxidation. Seven subjects with the extensive and four subjects with the poor metabolism phenotype received encainide (60 mg p.o. and 4.5 mg of [14C]encainide i.v. administered simultaneously) alone and during chronic treatment with low dose quinidine (50 mg q 6 hr) in a randomized, crossover design. In extensive metabolizers, quinidine decreased encainide systemic clearance from 935 +/- 541 to 190 +/- 77 ml/min and encainide nonrenal clearance from 782 +/- 474 to 95 +/- 32 ml/min (both P less than .02). In this population, quinidine significantly increased encainide elimination half-life from 1.8 +/- 1.2 to 7.7 +/- 2.4 hr and fractional urinary recovery of unchanged encainide from 17.5 +/- 7.6 to 47.4 +/- 7.8% (both P less than .001). The extent to which quinidine altered these indices of encainide disposition was highly correlated with the metabolic ratio for debrisoquine oxidation (r = 0.62-0.95). Moreover, poor metabolism and QRS prolongation during encainide were blunted by addition of quinidine; the extent of quinidine-induced reversal of encainide-related ECG changes was also correlated with debrisoquine ratio (r = 0.91). In contrast, in poor metabolizers, quinidine did not change encainide disposition kinetics and neither encainide alone nor encainide plus quinidine significantly altered electrocardiographic intervals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cholestasis was characterized by a selective reduction of the bile salt independent fraction of bile flow. Increased plasma K+ and decreased plasma Na+ concentrations, consistent with this effect, were observed. Because bile: plasma osmolality and biliary bile salt concentrations were elevated, increased permeability to bile salts and other osmotically active solutes between bile and plasma is unlikely. Bile salt excretion was normal despite the reduced bile flow because biliary bile salt concentration was increased. In contrast, the treated rats were unable to concentrate bromosulfophthalein in bile before, during and after the onset of cholestasis. Because no reduction in hepatic perfusion was observed in vivo in BCNU-treated rats, reduced xenobiotic organic anion excretion may be a selective effect of the drug. The cholestatic effects of BCNU appear to be different from either alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate or estrogenic steroids.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the interaction of SC-46542 [des(Phe106, Gly107, Ala115, Gln116)-AP(103-126)], a non-guanylate cyclase-linked atriopeptin (AP) binding site ligand, with thiorphan, an inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.11, on mean arterial pressure, urine flow, urinary sodium excretion and plasma AP immunoreactivity in conscious rats. The coadministration of SC-46542 (16 micrograms/kg/min) and thiorphan (30 mg/kg i.v. bolus) produced a greater diuresis and natriuresis (but had no effect on mean arterial pressure) than administration of either compound alone; plasma APir increased 2-fold during coadministration of SC-46542 and thiorphan (from 325 +/- 46 to 676 +/- 86 pg/ml). Administration of SC-46542 or thiorphan alone had small or no effects on mean arterial pressure, urine flow, urinary sodium excretion or plasma APir. Converting enzyme inhibition did not contribute to the effects of thiorphan since coadministration of captopril plus SC-46542 produced effects similar to SC-46542 alone. When a near threshold infusion of AP(103-126) was combined with the coadministration of SC-46542 and thiorphan, there was a potentiation of the depressor, diuretic and natriuretic responses. Neither SC-46542 nor thiorphan alone had these effects. SC-46542 potentiated the depressor but not diuretic or natriuretic responses to low dose AP(103-126) infusion; thiorphan had little or no effect on the responses to low dose AP(103-126). We conclude that blockade of non-guanylate cyclase-linked AP binding sites with SC-46542 combined with inhibition of AP degradation by endopeptidase 24.11 with thiorphan increases diuresis and natriuresis more than inhibition of either system alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of pertussis toxin sensitive guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G-proteins) in the signal transduction processes involved in postjunctional vascular alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction has been investigated in the cardiovascular system of the pithed rat. Pertussis toxin pretreatment (50 micrograms/kg i.v., 3 days before experimentation) produced a marked inhibition of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated pressor response to B-HT 933. In contrast, pertussis toxin treatment had only a small effect on the alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated pressor response to cirazoline. However, after elimination of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor reserve for cirazoline with phenoxybenzamine (0.1 mg/kg i.v.), the pressor response to this agonist became highly sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin treatment. This pattern of inhibition of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses by pertussis toxin is identical to that produced by inhibition of extracellular calcium influx by a high dose of the calcium channel antagonist, nifedipine (1.5 mg/kg i.a.), suggesting that those components of the alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor processes that are dependent upon the translocation of extracellular calcium may involve a pertussis toxin sensitive G-protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In peripheral lobules perfused under dual (maternal and fetal) recirculation for 6 hr, VPA was readily transferred, reaching equilibrium (stable maternal and fetal VPA concentrations with no transplacental gradient of unbound VPA) within 1.5 hr. Metabolism of VPA was not detected. VPA-G was transferred more slowly. After 6 hr of dual recirculation, equilibrium had not been reached and VPA-G had undergone extensive hydrolysis to VPA (34%) and rearrangement via acyl migration to structural isomers (collectively VPA-GR, 9%). Hydrolysis of VPA-G occurred, at least in part, in the perfusates contaminated with placental blood and/or with enzymes leached from placental tissue. Reliable transfer data for VPA-G were obtained using the dual single pass perfusion method. Steady state was achieved within 15 min and VPA, VPA-G and VPA-GR were transferred from maternal to fetal perfusates at 95, 13 and 17%, respectively, of antipyrine clearance. Transfer was positively correlated with lipophilicity as measured by the logarithm of the octanol/water partition coefficient: 0.204, -1.85, -1.66 for VPA, VPA-G and VPA-GR, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the skin tumor-promoting activity of mezerein in SENCAR mice. The effect of initiation dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) on tumor promotion by mezerein was examined. Excellent dose-response relationships were observed for initiation with DMBA at 0.2-20 micrograms per mouse with mezerein as a complete promoter. None of the mezerein-only promotion groups had papilloma responses similar to those of the corresponding groups receiving two-stage promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) followed by mezerein, even when a 40-micrograms initiating dose of DMBA was used. The effect delaying promotion with mezerein for 10 weeks was also examined in mice initiated with either 0.2, 2, 20, or 40 micrograms of DMBA per mouse. The 10-week delay led to a slight increase in the number of papillomas per mouse in some but not all treatment groups. Again, none of the delayed-mezerein-treatment groups had papilloma responses similar to those of the corresponding two-stage promotion (TPA-mezerein) groups at any corresponding initiating dose of DMBA. Finally, the progression of papillomas to carcinomas during promotion with mezerein was examined in groups of mice initiated with either 2 or 20 micrograms of DMBA. Higher ratios of carcinomas to papillomas were observed in mice promoted with mezerein than in mice receiving TPA promotion or two-stage promotion (TPA-mezerein). However, the presence of two to four times more papillomas in some mezerein-treated groups did not lead to greater numbers of carcinomas than in the groups with fewer papillomas. The data do not support the idea that spontaneous stage I promotion can be induced by delaying mezerein treatment for 10 weeks. Furthermore, the data suggest that the higher ratio of carcinomas to papillomas observed with mezerein promotion may be a function of the lower tumor burdens obtained after promotion with this compound rather than a specific property of the chemical.\r"

Granulocytes from all patients showed a decrease in leukotriene generation which only returned to normal levels when the patients recovered from their injuries. The leukotriene generation induced by different stimuli, i.e., the Ca++-ionophore A23187 (7.3 microM) or opsonized zymosan (2 mg) in the presence of exogenous arachidonic acid (60 microM) showed similar stimulation profiles. The cellular differentiation of the respective granulocyte fractions revealed that the decreased leukotriene generation was accompanied by the occurrence of immature granulocytes in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, the studies in the presence of exogenous arachidonic acid showed that the defect in leukotriene generation from granulocytes of surviving patients was due to the availability of metabolizable substrate (i.e., free arachidonic acid). Granulocytes from one nonsurviving patient showed in addition a defect in the metabolic ability of arachidonic acid to generate the respective leukotrienes. The generation of reactive oxygen species did not correlate with the observed alterations in the formation of the leukotrienes.\r"

Autologous neutrophils from ten pigs were labelled with 111Indium-oxine. The pigs were placed under a scintillation camera for continuous recording of the activity distribution in the pigs during 105 minutes. Following a steady-state period of 15 minutes seven pigs were subjected to a standardized soft-tissue trauma. Three pigs were used as controls and not traumatized. Within 1-3 minutes after trauma the radioactivity over the lungs increased dramatically, indicating PNT. This was followed by a fast decrease but 90 minutes after trauma PNT levels were still significantly elevated. LNT showed a similar pattern, although the immediate increase was less dramatic. This study shows that PNT and LNT occur immediately after soft-tissue trauma and can be studied dynamically in vivo.\r"

Only 11 per cent of these 183 patients had undetectable prostate specific antigen levels at a mean interval of 5 years since completion of radiotherapy. Prostate specific antigen levels after radiotherapy were directly related to initial clinical stage and Gleason score before treatment. Multiple prostate specific antigen determinations were performed with time in 124 of 183 patients. During year 1 after radiotherapy prostate specific antigen levels were decreasing in 82 per cent of the patients but only 8 per cent continued to decrease beyond year 1. Of 80 patients observed greater than 1 year after completion of radiotherapy 51 per cent had increasing values and 41 per cent had stable values. Increasing prostate specific antigen values after radiotherapy were correlated with progression to metastastic disease and residual cancer on prostate biopsy. Total serum acid phosphatase levels were poorly related to prostate specific antigen levels, were less effective in discriminating patients with metastatic disease and provided no additional information beyond that provided by prostate specific antigen.\r"

Ten age-matched fertile men were used as controls. Baseline serum follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels were not significantly different between vasectomized men and controls. However, mean serum follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormone responses to an intravenous bolus injection of 100 mcg. gonadotropin-releasing hormone were significantly greater in the vasectomy group (p equals 0.008 and 0.003, respectively). There was no correlation between these responses and the interval after vasectomy. Serum antisperm antibodies were present in 13 vasectomized men (52 per cent) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and microagglutination techniques. A significant correlation (p equals 0.003) was found between the presence of serum antisperm antibodies and a normal follicle-stimulating hormone response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation. Of 13 patients with demonstrable antisperm antibody titers 9 (69 per cent) had normal follicle-stimulating hormone responses, compared to only 1 of 12 (8 per cent) without identifiable antisperm antibody titers. Our data suggest that certain men following vasectomy have abnormalities in seminiferous tubule and Leydig cell functions of the testes. These abnormalities are unrelated to the interval after vasectomy and are not identifiable with routine static hormonal measurements. In addition, serum antisperm antibodies are most likely to be present in men who demonstrate normal seminiferous tubular activity after vasectomy.\r"

Washed spermatozoa from 21 fertile donors were incubated with ionized calcium (zero, five, 10 and 50 mM), EDTA (one and 10 mM), diltiazem (one, 10, 100 microM and one mM) and cAMP (five mM). Per cent motility and mean velocity determinations were made at 10 and 120 min. by computerized analysis of videomicrographs. Over a wide range of extracellular ionized calcium concentrations (50 microM to 50 mM), per cent motility and mean velocity of human sperm were not stimulated or inhibited. At ionized calcium concentration less than 1 microM, achieved by addition of EDTA (10 mM), per cent motility decreased by 68% and 79% and mean velocity decreased by 44% and 48% compared to controls at 10 and 120 min. respectively (p less than 0.001). The decrease in mean velocity was reversible by addition of calcium to the EDTA (10 mM) sample to return ionized calcium to control concentration (0.5 mM). This reversibility suggests EDTA did not have a direct toxic effect on spermatozoa and that its action was mediated by changes in ionized calcium concentration. Diltiazem (one mM) decreased sperm mean velocity by 26% and 28% compared to controls at 10 and 120 min. respectively (p less than 0.01), but had no effect at lower concentrations (one, 10 or 100 microM). Db-cAMP (five mM) increased per cent motility by 25% and 20% and mean velocity by 36% and 34% compared to controls at 10 and 120 min. respectively (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that a minimum level of extracellular ionized calcium is essential to normal sperm motility and suggest that sperm are more dependent on the intracellular translocation of calcium ions for the regulation of motility than on the extracellular ionized calcium concentration. While db-cAMP does significantly increase per cent motility and mean velocity of human sperm, its clinical usefulness for the treatment of male infertility remains to be demonstrated.\r"

This reduction in the number of wet episodes was statistically significant, both with respect to this group's baseline levels of incontinence and in comparison with the performance of the control women. The number of wet episodes in the control group remained about the same throughout training and the 22-week follow-up period. The treatment women improved partly because they learned to request help, a response prompted and reinforced by the program. Trainees with a high frequency of incontinence during baseline, the more cognitively intact residents, and residents with normal bladder capacity responded better to this behavior therapy program.\r"

Butyrate is the preferred oxidative fuel of the colonocyte in vitro, and the provision of preferred intestinal fuels has been shown to stimulate mucosal proliferation in vivo. This study determined whether chronic colonic infusion of butyrate or a combination of SCFA would stimulate intestinal mucosal growth in an animal deprived of its normal source of SCFA, fiber fermentation in the cecum. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a fat- and fiber-free elemental liquid diet and underwent cecectomy, ileocolic anastomosis, and insertion of a proximal colonic infusion catheter. Rats were then assigned to receive either a continuous infusion of butyrate (20 mM, 40 mM, or 150 mM), SCFA (70 mM acetate + 35 mM propionate + 20 mM butyrate), or saline, or to receive no infusion. A seventh group underwent proximal colonic transection and reanastomosis. After 7 days, jejunal, ileal, and proximal colonic segments were analyzed for mucosal weight, protein, RNA, and DNA. In the colon, the 40-mM butyrate infusion resulted in significant elevations in all mucosal parameters relative to all three control groups, saline infusion, no infusion, and transection. Both the 20-mM butyrate and the SCFA groups showed increased colonic mucosal DNA compared to controls. In the jejunum and ileum, mucosal DNA content was significantly greater in the SCFA group than in the control groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Diarrhea is one of the most common complications in patients who receive tube-feeding formulas. Since the colon is the final site of water and electrolyte absorption and ultimately determines fecal composition, diarrhea during tube feeding may result from altered colonic function. The lack of dietary fiber, such as pectin, in tube-feeding formulas may be one of the means by which colonic function is affected. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a standard, liquid, commercially available, isotonic tube-feeding formula (ITFF) and the effects of supplementing the ITFF with pectin on colonic function as measured by stool consistency and colonic fluid composition in 13 normal adults. Data were obtained when subjects consumed their regular diet, ITFF, and ITFF supplemented with pectin using the technique of in vivo dialysis of colonic fluid. Ingestion of the ITFF resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of liquid stools compared to a regular diet [median (interquartile range) = 0% (0), 60% (64); p less than 0.01]. Ingestion of the ITFF also resulted in significant decreases in the concentrations of sodium, potassium, and short-chain fatty acids, and increases in pH and osmotic gap in colonic fluid compared to the subjects' regular diet. Supplementing the ITFF with pectin significantly reduced the incidence of liquid stools [0% (0)] and promoted a normalization of colonic fluid composition. The results suggest that the addition of pectin may enhance tolerance to ITFFs.\r"

Both subjects with elevated D-lactate levels had bone pain, x-ray evidence of fractures, and biopsy evidence of osteomalacia.

In spite of a moderate increase in CO2 production (VCO2) observed during the administration of fat in S, a VCO2-sparing effect of fat, with respect to equicaloric amounts of glucose, was reconfirmed. The relevance of the therapeutic modulation of CO2 production during parenteral nutrition, and the relative impact on the abnormal septic respiratory patterns, were emphasized by analyzing the physiological relationships and mechanisms responsible for the increase in respiratory work in sepsis.\r"

Specialized home nutritional support was provided to five patients (one enteral and four parenteral) with restoration of adequate nutritional status, improved quality of life, and few metabolic or technical complications over a period of 12 to 86 months. Three patients eventually died of their disease, one was converted to an oral diet, and one patient remains dependent on total parenteral nutrition. This experience would recommend consideration of home nutritional support in patients with systemic scleroderma when the disease is relatively stable and no major organ failure is present.\r"

Carbohydrate digestion was evaluated in 10 subjects with the hydrogen breath analysis test during 8 hr of observation. Lactose intolerance was determined by evaluation of subject's symptoms. With the infusion of intact milk (IM), none of the subjects were able to efficiently digest the lactose infused (5.6 +/- 0.35 g/hr, mean +/- SEM) and 86% of them experienced major symptoms of intolerance. With the infusion of lactose-prehydrolyzed milk (HM) and enzyme-added milk (EM) there was a highly significant reduction in lactose maldigestion. More importantly, major symptoms were present in only 10% of subjects with EM, and were completely eliminated with HM. Lactose maldigestion and intolerance represent a major limitation for the application of milk-based polymeric formula for liquid diets in undernourished subjects. The use of exogenous beta-galactosidases represents an alternative to avoid such reactions.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine if plasma Mn concentrations were elevated in infants and children fed intravenously who developed cholestatic liver disease. An additional aim was to determine the Mn content of intravenous solutions. The study included nine subjects with normal liver function (group A) and five subjects who developed cholestatic liver disease while fed intravenously (group B). Serum total bilirubin in group B had been elevated for 1 wk to 5 months prior to entry into this study. Mean plasma Mn for group A was 0.79 +/- 0.18 ng/ml, which was similar to that for adult controls. The mean for group B was 3.06 +/- 2.07 ng Mn/ml which was significantly higher (p less than 0.005). Plasma Mn was correlated positively with serum total bilirubin (r = 0.874, p less than 0.001). In four group B subjects studied longitudinally, plasma Mn declined. This decline was associated with a decline in serum total bilirubin in one subject and both a decline in serum total bilirubin and a reduction in, or a cessation of, supplemental intravenous Mn in two subjects. In the fourth subject, hepatic dysfunction remained severe, but plasma Mn declined to a near normal value after discontinuing supplemental intravenous Mn. The mean Mn contamination in the final intravenous infusate was 5.1 +/- 2.1 micrograms Mn/1. In conclusion, it is recommended that plasma Mn concentrations be monitored in patients fed intravenously who have evidence of cholestatic liver disease. If monitoring is not feasible, Mn supplements should be withheld.\r"

Half of the patients who died, did so within 6 months of commencing HPN. Sixty % died of their underlying disease. Most patients with scleroderma or an underlying malignancy are dead within a year of commencing HPN. In contrast, patients with Crohn's disease or the short bowel syndrome due to volvulus do well. In only 14 patients was death attributable to the administration of HPN. In this group the main causes were septicemia, SVC thrombosis, and hepatic failure. Our study suggests that HPN should be used in patients with malignancy and scleroderma only in exceptional circumstances and that further work is necessary for the prevention of SVC thrombosis.\r"

We report here an open, prospective, study of the blood levels of water-soluble vitamins in infants and children on TPN before and during supplementation with a new water-soluble multivitamin formula containing per vial unit: B1, 3 mg; B2, 3.6 mg; B6, 4 mg; niacin, 40 mg; pantothenate, 15 mg; ascorbate, 100 mg; biotin, 60 micrograms; folic acid, 400 micrograms; B12, 5 micrograms. Thirteen children, 9 months to 15 yr old, on home TPN for 1.5 months to 7 yr, and 17 hospitalized infants and children, 1 week to 15 yr old, receiving TPN were studied for 2 weeks to 4 months. Daily doses were given according to age: 1/2 vial if less than 18 months; 1 vial if greater than 18 months and less than 10 years; 1.5 vials if greater than 10 years. Assays for B1, B2, biotin, niacin, plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folates were performed by microbiologic methods, B12 was measured by radioimmunoassay. During the study, B1 levels were consistently above the upper limit of the normal range, B2 and B12 remained in the normal range although there was a slight decrease in B12 values. Almost half of the patients had initially low levels of biotin, niacin, and folates. Biotin, after a significant sharp rise during the first month of supplementation returned to normal range. Niacin levels were initially low in infants and rose toward normal values during treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

[75Se] H2SeO3 (100 micrograms Se/liter) was incubated at 25 degrees C with pure ascorbic acid (100 or 500 mg/liter) or added to complete TPN solutions containing similar levels of ascorbate. The mixtures were subjected to thin layer electrophoresis at pH 5.3 to separate HSeO3- from Se degree. In complete TPN formulas, little or no reduction of HSeO3- to Se degree occurred over a 24-hr period, whereas complete reduction occurred with pure ascorbic acid. Further experiments showed that the amino acid component of the TPN formula was preventing the reduction of selenite, and that reduction of selenite by ascorbate did not occur in buffered solutions having a pH of 5 or greater. These results show that reduction of selenite is strongly influenced by pH. At the concentrations of H2SeO3 and ascorbic acid commonly used, reduction to elemental Se is unlikely to be a practical problem in TPN solutions in the near-neutral pH range.\r"

A 31-year-old, white man was admitted after sustaining a gunshot wound to the chest and mandible. Subsequently, the patient developed pulmonary emboli documented by angiography. Attempts at anticoagulation with oral warfarin were unsuccessful while the patient was receiving 50-100 ml/hr of Osmolite through an Entriflex feeding tube and intermittent oral Ensure Plus supplements. Discontinuation of the Osmolite resulted in a prompt prolongation of the prothrombin time. The Ensure Plus was continued and adequate prothrombin times were achieved on 7.5 to 10 mg of warfarin daily. The total amount of vitamin K received from the enteral feedings ranged from 50 to 115 micrograms/day, which is less than the normal daily intake of 300 to 500 micrograms. Previous reports of warfarin resistance implicated older enteral feeding products with a much higher vitamin K content. Difficulty with anticoagulation may still be experienced with the newer formulations. It is unknown whether the vitamin K content or malabsorption of warfarin is the mechanism of resistance.\r"

Animals were sacrificed six hours after the second dose of endotoxin. Glomerular fibrin deposition was reduced in animals receiving TPA four hours after the second injection of endotoxin and was absent in animals receiving TPA five hours after the second dose of endotoxin. Glomerular fibrinolytic activity was reduced following development of the generalized Shwartzman reaction but was normal in animals that received TPA five hours after the second injection of endotoxin. TPA did not produce a systemic fibrinolytic state and did not prevent the decline in hematologic and coagulation factors typical of the Shwartzman reaction, despite the elimination of glomerular fibrin. These results suggest that TPA effectively removes glomerular thrombi in the generalized Shwartzman reaction and infers that TPA may be of value in the treatment of human diseases with similar pathology, such as the hemolytic uremic syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) has been suggested to exert a tubular effect on the mammalian nephron, perhaps in part by interacting with other hormones. In the present study, the effect of ANF was examined on glomeruli (Gm) and different renal tubule segments including medullary (MAL) and cortical thick ascending limb (CAL) and cortical (CCT), outer medullary (OMCT) and inner medullary collecting tubules (IMCT). This effect of ANF was assessed by alteration in adenylate cyclase and cGMP in the various nephron segments in the presence and absence of arginine vasopressin (AVP), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin (SCT). An effect of ANF (10(-8) M) was not demonstrated on adenylate cyclase (fmol cAMP formed/30 min/micrograms protein) in Gm, CAL, MAL, CCT, OMCT or IMCT. Nor did ANF (10(-8) M) interfere with the effect of PTH (5 IU/ml) on the Gm (PTH 35.1 +/- 3.7 vs. PTH + ANF 32.5 +/- 1.8, NS), CAL (PTH 50.5 +/- 10.9 vs. PTH + ANF 46.2 +/- 1.4, NS) or AVP (10(-8) M) on the CCT (AVP 40.8 +/- 6.6 vs. AVP + ANF 33.0 +/- 3.1, NS), OMCT (AVP 56.0 +/- 11.8 vs. AVP + ANF 42.1 +/- 6.7, NS), IMCT (AVP 66.5 +/- 4.6 vs. AVP + ANF 53.5 +/- 7.0, NS) or MAL (AVP 15.5 +/- 1.6 vs. AVP + ANF 14.0 +/- 2.6, NS). ANF also did not affect SCT (1.5 x 10(-8) M)-induced adenylate cyclase on CCT (SCT 69.8 +/- 11.3 vs. SCT + ANF 79.9 +/- 7.2, NS). ANF (10(-8) M), however, significantly increased cGMP in the Gm (6.4 +/- 1.7 to 121.3 +/- 32.4 fmol/micrograms protein, P less than 0.001) and IMCT (0.63 +/- 0.16 to 1.46 +/- 0.29 fmol/micrograms protein, P less than 0.05). However, no effect of ANF on cGMP was observed in the CAL, CCT, OMCT, and MAL even at 10(-7) M ANF. PTH (5 IU/ml) did not alter either basal or ANF-stimulated cGMP in the Gm. Also, specific ANF binding was studied in the microdissected IMCT. Kd was 6.08 x 10(-9) M and Bmax was 8.07 x 10(-11) M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the course of some pathological and experimental nephropathies, intraglomerular fibrin deposits develop, possibly as a consequence of inefficient fibrinolysis. In vitro human glomeruli exhibit fibrinolytic activity due to the synthesis of plasminogen activators (PAs) such as, tissue-type PA (t-PA) and urokinase-type PA (u-PA). Immunofluorescence studies have previously shown that t-PA is localized in the capillary tufts and u-PA in the visceral epithelial cells. We have now investigated the fibrinolytic activity of cultured human mesangial cells. Inhibitory activity towards u-PA or t-PA but not plasmin was found in both conditioned medium and cellular extracts. Analysis of the conditioned medium by zymography revealed a single band of PA-activity (Mr: 110 to 120 kDa). Immunoneutralization with anti-t-PA and anti-plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) IgG but not anti-u-PA or anti-PAI-2 removed this band. Reverse fibrin autography demonstrated the presence of PAI-1 in both cellular extracts and in conditioned medium. Western Blot analysis showed that two bands (50 kD and 120 kD) were recognized by the anti-PAI-1 antibody. By ELISA t-PA and PAI-1 antigens were found to increase progressively with time in the culture medium but not in cellular extracts. Both t-PA and PAI-1, but not u-PA and PAI-2, were also detected by immunofluorescence studies. Thus human glomerular mesangial cells synthesize and secrete t-PA and PAI-1 in vitro. PAI-1 is produced in excess, therefore t-PA is only found in the form of a complex with PAI-1.\r"

The solubilized material was first applied onto an affinity chromatographic column of acetazolamide-oxirane-SepharoseR-CL-4B to remove contaminating cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase isozymes CA I and CA II. It was then added onto an affinity column of p-aminomethylbenzene sulfonamide coupled to CM Bio-gel AR to purify the membrane-bound carbonic anhydrase activity. This resulted in a 50% pure enzyme. It was then concentrated and fractionated on an anion-exchange column, and desalted and purified to homogeneity (SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing) by gel filtration. The enzyme was now purified 411-fold from extractable membrane protein. Its molecular weight was 34.4 kDa from gel filtration and SDS-PAGE, and 36.7 kDa from amino acid analysis. The amino acid composition differed from that of the cytoplasmic isozymes CA I, II, and III. Antisera, produced in rabbits against the purified SDS-treated enzyme, reacted with native nondenatured membrane enzyme protein but only weakly with CA II. Kinetically the enzyme was similar to CA II with respect to hydrase and esterase activities and to inhibition by various sulfonamides. Considered together, the data suggest that the human kidney contains a membrane-bound carbonic anhydrase protein that differs from the cytoplasmic isozymes CA I, II, and III and the secretory form (CA VI) in the saliva.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial dysfunction after induced ischemic arrest is an important problem in cardiac surgery. Adenosine-5'-triphosphate content in myocardial tissue remains depressed for days after ischemia, perhaps because of reperfusion washout of diffusable purine substrates. Left ventricular function is also depressed after ischemia, but its relationship to absolute tissue adenosine triphosphate content is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that arresting hearts with a cardioplegic solution containing adenosine, hypoxanthine, and ribose would result in improved tissue adenosine triphosphate content and left ventricular function after 1 hour of normothermic global ischemia in dogs supported by cardiopulmonary bypass. Animals with ischemic arrest initiated with a crystalloid cardioplegic solution containing adenosine 100 mumol/L, hypoxanthine 100 mumol/L, and ribose 2 mmol/L demonstrated significant improvement (p less than 0.05) during postischemic reperfusion. A significant correlation (p less than 0.05) existed between myocardial adenosine triphosphate content and the recovery of left ventricular function. These experiments demonstrate that an asanguineous cardioplegic solution containing adenosine, hypoxanthine, and ribose maintains myocardial adenosine triphosphate content during ischemia and reperfusion and enhances functional recovery during the postischemic period.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of endotoxin on the fibrinolytic response, we administered Escherichia coli endotoxin (4 ng per kilogram of body weight) intravenously to 19 healthy volunteers and measured fibrinolytic proteins, protease inhibitors, neutrophil elastase, and von Willebrand factor in serial blood samples obtained over 24 hours. One hour after endotoxin administration, the level of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen rose from 10 to 23 ng per milliliter, peaking at 52 ng per milliliter at three hours. The level of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complexes increased sevenfold, peaking at three hours. Plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 activity rose more slowly, from 7 U per milliliter to a maximum of 49 U per milliliter at five hours. The concentrations of neutrophil elastase and von Willebrand antigen were unchanged at one hour, increased approximately threefold by 3 hours, and remained elevated at 24 hours. None of these measures changed in a control group (n = 5) given intravenous saline instead of endotoxin. We studied t-PA functional activity in four subjects. The level of activity rose rapidly, from 1.2 ng per milliliter at base line to 8.3 ng per milliliter at one hour and 13.9 ng per milliliter at two hours; it was undetectable at three hours. This increase in plasminogen activator activity was abolished in vitro by incubation of t-PA with an antiserum specific for human t-PA, suggesting that t-PA may be directly responsible for plasmin generation in the response to endotoxin. We conclude from this study of healthy subjects that endotoxin activates the fibrinolytic system, beginning with release of t-PA in the blood within one hour. The early activation of plasmin by endotoxin may prevent thrombosis, and the increase in fibrinolysis is then offset by the release of plasminogen activator inhibitor.\r"

It has been hypothesized that abnormally high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) may contribute to the reduced folliculogenesis. We therefore performed a controlled, open trial in which treatment with buserelin, an agonist of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone citrate and HMG in 44 consecutive women in whom no oocytes or only one had been produced by standard treatment with clomiphene and HMG. Twenty-nine women received buserelin with HMG, and 15 received clomiphene citrate with HMG. The median number of oocytes per patient recovered from those who received buserelin with HMG was 4 (range, 0 to 19), as compared with 0 (range, 0 to 5) in those who received clomiphene citrate with HMG. The fertilization rates of oocytes recovered from both groups of patients were similar (75.8 percent and 76.5 percent, respectively). Fifty-four percent of patients given buserelin with HMG underwent triple-embryo transfer, as compared with 13 percent of those given clomiphene citrate with HMG. Pregnancy (n = 3) occurred only among the patients receiving buserelin with HMG. In the buserelin-HMG group, significantly fewer oocytes were recovered from patients with occult ovarian failure (infertility and elevated follicular-phase levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, with regular menses) (median, 1; range, 0 to 4) than from those with other causes of infertility (median, 8; range, 0 to 19). Our data suggest that, except in women with occult ovarian failure, buserelin and HMG improve embryologic and clinical outcomes in patients with previously unsatisfactory stimulation of the ovaries for in vitro fertilization.\r"

Bleeding occurred briefly at the incision in 2 animals; otherwise the clinical condition of all 6 remained normal throughout the postoperative period. Systemic fibrinolysis did not occur, and gross and microscopic examination of the brain and meninges revealed no abnormality. Next, we evaluated the efficacy of unilateral administration of rt-PA suspension (0.5 mg) plus slow-release gel rt-PA (1.25 mg) in lysing a bilateral subarachnoid clot and preventing vasospasm in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Sixteen monkeys were divided randomly into 2 equal groups, each of which underwent baseline cerebral angiography, followed by frontotemporal craniectomy and induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage on the left side and then on the right. Before closure on the right side either rt-PA or an equal volume of placebo was injected into the subarachnoid space. On day 7 angiography was repeated, and the animals were killed under anesthesia for necropsy. One of the animals in the placebo group developed a cerebral infarction on day 5. In the placebo group significant vasospasm occurred in all major right and left-sided anterior cerebral vessels (P less than 0.01). No vasospasm occurred in the rt-PA-treated animals. Whereas gross subarachnoid clot was found in all animals in the placebo group (mean clot weight 1.13 g), only a small fragment of clot was found in a single rt-PA-treated animal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We transformed COX-deficient fibroblasts from a child with Leigh's syndrome with simian virus 40 to obtain cells with an infinite life span. These cells were still COX-deficient, grew normally in HAT medium, and were ouabain-sensitive. We fused these cells with a HAT-sensitive, ouabain-resistant variant of HeLa cells (HeLacot) and isolated surviving hybrid clones in ouabain-containing HAT medium. Prolonged cultivation of the hybrids was accompanied by preferential loss of HeLacot mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as determined by mtDNA restriction patterns of parental and hybrid cell DNA with the restriction endonuclease HaeII. COX activity was normal or higher than normal in hybrids, including the progeny of cell clones that had lost almost all the HeLacot mtDNA. These data demonstrate that COX deficiency in this Leigh's syndrome patient's cells was corrected by a nuclear DNA-encoded factor from the HeLacot parent and ruled out an mtDNA mutation as the basis for COX deficiency. This system can be used to determine whether different generalized mitochondrial disorders are due to mutations of nuclear or mtDNA.\r"

Small blood clot emboli were injected into the internal carotid arteries of rabbits. Angiograms confirmed occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery in 100% of subjects. tPA or saline was administered as a 30-minute infusion at various times after embolization. Hemorrhage rates were similar in all groups regardless of treatment. tPA increased the prothrombin time and the thrombin time but not the partial thromboplastin time. There was no correlation between these changes in blood coagulation and the finding of cerebral hemorrhage. We observed a significant association between stroke severity and cerebral hemorrhage. We conclude that tPA treatment successfully causes thrombolysis of cerebral emboli without causing an increase in the incidence of cerebral hemorrhage in rabbits.\r"

All patients had a favorable response to initial treatment. Cytomegalovirus retinitis progressed in four fellow eyes in which treatment was deferred. Vision improved or remained stable in all but one eye. Patients were followed for a mean of 4 months and received an average of 16.6 intravitreal injections in each eye. Relapse occurred late in the course while on maintenance treatment in five eyes (33%). There was no evidence of toxicity from repeated intravitreal injections. Treatment was very well tolerated. The only severe complication in a total of 249 injections was a single case of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis which responded to intravitreal antibiotic treatment. Intravitreal ganciclovir is an effective alternative to systemic ganciclovir in those patients with severe neutropenia and in those patients who desire to remain on systemic ZDV.\r"

Stimuli were fluid pressure pulses in a closed hydraulic system (no net flow), which was coupled to the lateral semicircular canal near the ampulla. Hydraulic waveform output and fluid pressure was monitored in situ via a parallel hydraulic circuit during experiments. Maximum fluid displacement at the level of the horizontal canal was 0.025 microliters. The intensity, duration, and presentation rate of the stimulus were varied during experiments. Field potentials were recorded differentially using subdermal electrodes, with the active lead in the region of the mastoid referenced to a distant nasal site. A total of 256 trials was accumulated for each run using an averaging computer. Evoked responses were physiologically vulnerable and reproducible, with little variance among animals. Response amplitude increased monotonically until saturation was noted and responses followed the temporal structure of the pressure wave. Polarity reversal with differing electrode placement suggests that the generator site lies within the mastoid. Further, intense broad-band acoustic stimuli and eighth nerve sectioning did not affect the vestibular evoked potentials, but could be shown to abolish the auditory evoked potentials. Results of these experiments support the notion that vestibular evoked potentials are related to the first derivative of the pressure pulse waveforms. Future experiments will be directed toward the assessment of vestibular physiology and pharmacology with this evoked response method.\r"

When the recurrent laryngeal nerve was denervated unilaterally, decrease in peak glottic closing pressure on swallowing was only about 36%, whereas the peak pressure of reflex glottic closure was markedly diminished to 4.5 +/- 4.6%. When bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerves denervated, decrease in peak pressure during deglutition showed no greater significance than it did after unilateral denervation. Inferior constrictors myotomy in addition to bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve denervation reduced peak pressure to nearly zero. These results indicate that on swallowing, the inferior constrictors cooperate with the intrinsic laryngeal adductors, thus playing a very important role in reinforcing glottic closure, a function that is unlikely during reflex glottic closure.\r"

Since then little information regarding the newly adapted criteria and their effects on the evaluation process has appeared. Thus we compared the results of different surgical procedures for Meniere's disease using both the 1985 and 1972 guidelines. One hundred nine surgical procedures from 1969 to 1985 were reviewed. Six different surgical procedures were evaluated: the Cody-Tack, cochleosacculotomy, endolymphatic mastoid shunt, endolymphatic subarachnoid shunt, translabyrinthine vestibular nerve section, and transcanal labyrinthectomy. Results show that 68% of patients who had a Cody-Tack procedure continued to have vertiginous episodes in the same frequency postoperatively. Hearing was worse in 17 of these 25 patients. Of the patients who had a cochleosacculotomy, most had significant control of their vertiginous symptoms, but 10 patients had greater than 10 dB hearing loss postoperatively. Patients who had an endolymphatic mastoid shunt performed had better results when the 1972 guidelines were applied. In this group, the 1985 guidelines indicate that only 35% of the patients had significant relief of their vertiginous symptoms and 47% had hearing loss greater than 10 dB postoperatively. Six of the seven patients who underwent an endolymphatic subarachnoid shunt obtained significant relief of their vertiginous episodes, but hearing loss was more than 10 dB in four patients. Those patients who had either a labyrinthectomy or a translabyrinthine vestibular nerve section had relief of their vertiginous episodes. We conclude that the new guidelines appear to be superior to the 1972 guidelines for reporting results for the treatment of Meniere's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Isolates of nontypable haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) recovered from paired nasopharyngeal (NP) and middle ear (ME) fluid cultures performed simultaneously on seven children with otitis media with effusion (OME) were studied by analysis of the restriction fragment patterns produced from total genomic DNA. This method provides a sensitive measure of the genetic similarities between strains. In the seven pairs examined, the NP and ME strains were indistinguishable from one another, whereas each pair was distinct from the other, except for two siblings in whom all four strains were identical. This information provides evidence that the pathogenesis of OME caused by NTHI involves spread of the bacteria from NP to the ME. Analysis of paired NP and ME isolates from three children with recurrent OME caused by NTHI indicated that the second episode was caused by the reinfection with a different strain rather than persistence and reemergence of the first strain. Finally, DNA analysis of strains from two siblings with concurrent OME suggested that person-to-person transmission of NTHI can occur among children. These findings suggest that at any one time the NTHI population in the NP is relatively homogenous, at least at the time of acute upper respiratory disease. Our observation that the strains present at the second episode of otitis media were different than the strains present in the first episode is consistent with strain replacement in the NP. Restriction fragment mapping analysis of genomic DNA of NTHI could provide a powerful tool for investigating the rate of turnover of the NTHI population in the NP.\r"

The Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen is a glycoprotein structure participating in the structure of the MN blood group antigen. It is also the structure that binds the peanut agglutinin. Perhaps this antigen, which we found on fetal larynges as well as on malignant laryngeal epithelial lining, is another oncodevelopmental antigen.\r"

Beginning in November 1984 nearly all patients were evaluated with preoperative radionuclide and ultrasound imaging studies. Ultrasound correctly localized 76% of the adenomas removed at surgery, whereas the success rate with radionuclide imaging was 74%. Localization of hyperplastic glands was less successful with the use of either technique. Correct preoperative localization studies in cases of single adenoma reduced the operative time an average of 32 minutes when compared with those cases with no localization studies. Cost-effectiveness was studied based on current charges for operating room time, anesthesia, and the preoperative localization studies. An average cost savings of $124 per case was achieved when results of both localization studies were correct. These localization studies are quick, noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, and associated with no morbidity. Because it is possible to reduce operative time and overall costs, we recommend that radionuclide and ultrasound studies be routinely used in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

In general, the two ears behaved the same: if a \"flat\" sensorineural loss occurred in one ear, it was likely to develop in the other. Similarly, if one ear developed a high-tone loss, the other would do likewise. With the exception of acute fistula, there is no suggestion that the operation of stapedectomy predisposes an ear to late sensorineural problems. Patients with bone-conduction thresholds that are depressed at all frequencies when first examined should be advised that progressive sensorineural hearing loss may occur later in both ears. Accordingly, the benefit gained by stapedectomy may ultimately need to be supplemented by hearing aids. This study also revealed that a patient with clinical conductive otosclerosis in only one ear at first presentation had only a 50% chance of long-term benefit from stapedectomy.\r"

Tubercle bacilli are hardly facultative intracellular pathogens that live and multiply in nonactivated macrophages. Before tubercle bacilli can be destroyed by macrophages, these cells must be activated by T lymphocytes and their lymphokines. Such activation is the essence of cell-mediated immunity. Cell-mediated immunity also has a detrimental component, called delayed-type hypersensitivity. This component causes caseous necrosis of host tissues whenever the bacillary antigens reach high levels. Such levels occur intracellularly in macrophages of highly susceptible hosts and extracellularly in liquefied caseous foci of resistant hosts. Vaccines containing antigens that create more cell-mediated immunity and less delayed-type hypersensitivity are greatly needed.\r"

Three clones, pMTB1, pMTb2, and pMTb3, were selected for further study. Southern analysis indicated that these clones reacted strongly with DNA from strains of M. tuberculosis isolated in different parts of the world, weakly with DNA from other mycobacterial species, and not at all with Escherichia coli or human DNA. Smaller fragments of mycobacterial DNA contained in plasmid pMTb3 were subcloned into pBR322 (pMTb4) or pUC12 (pMTb5). These recombinant plasmids hybridized with DNA from M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and Mycobacterium bovis BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) Montreal and may provide the reagents needed for the development of new methods for rapid diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infections.\r"

Nonspecific suppression may be mediated by circulating immune complexes containing mycobacterial polysaccharides such as D-arabino-D-galactan. The mechanism of suppression involves activation of monocyte production of immunosuppressive prostaglandin E2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with tuberculosis include increased numbers of monocytes that suppress the response to tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD). Antigen-specific suppression is associated with monocyte activation by a number of criteria, including decreased surface expression of HLA-DR determinants and increased production of interleukin 1 (IL-1). The increased production of IL-1 is associated with--and may have a causal relation to--immunosuppression. A second parallel regulatory mechanism involves PPD-specific suppression by Fc gamma receptor-bearing lymphocytes. The consequence of these immunosuppressive circuits is depression of tuberculin-induced blastogenesis, production of IL-2, and generation of IL-2 receptors. These findings suggest that natural infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis may result in immunosuppression. Studies of potentially protective antigens in experimental systems must be designed to assess and avoid activation of suppressor circuits.\r"

  ".W": "In the last two decades, no new major antituberculosis drug has been developed. Although dramatic improvements in chemotherapy for tuberculosis have been achieved through careful studies of drug regimens, there is still a need for new agents that are highly active. The antimycobacterial drugs used at present in therapy for tuberculosis were obtained by either blind screening or chemical modification of active compounds, with tentative optimization of chemotherapeutic properties. Other approaches based on knowledge of the biochemistry of the mycobacterial cell should be tried. Certain constituents of the cell, such as mycolic acids, arabinogalactan, peptidoglycan, and mycobactins, may represent specific targets for new antituberculosis drugs. Products interfering with the biosynthesis of these mycobacterial constituents can be expected to show specific activity against these microorganisms, with no effect on the normal bacterial flora.\r"

  ".U": "89222190\r", 
  ".W": "New antitubercular agents are needed for two main purposes: to further simplify therapy (through reductions in the number of medicaments used, the number of doses administered, and the duration of treatment required), thus facilitating supervision and improving compliance, and to combat resistant mycobacteria. Reduction in the number of medicaments has been achieved by combining two or more drugs in a single tablet while retaining a degree of bioavailability similar to that of the single components. The adverse effects observed with once-weekly high doses of rifampin have limited the development of widely spaced intermittent regimens of treatment. For this reason new rifamycins have been developed that are as active as rifampin against mycobacteria but that also offer the advantage of high and prolonged serum levels and thus have the potential for once-weekly administration. The in vitro and in vivo properties of these drugs have been studied. Three classes of drugs show promise for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis: spiropiperidyl rifamycin, the fluoroquinolones, and combinations of beta-lactam agents and beta-lactamase inhibitors.\r"

It was shown that such a cell can replace its light chain by rearranging and expressing a new light chain from the other allele. Anti-idiotype antibodies were used to isolate idiotypic variants from a surface IgM+lambda+ human B cell tumor line. The variants expressed a new lambda light chain. Both the original and the new lambda transcripts were present in the variant cells, but only the new one was expressed as a protein on the cell surface. Therefore, although the cell exhibited allelic exclusion and had only one Ig receptor at a time, the commitment to a particular light chain gene was reversible.\r"

The messenger RNAs of some of these genes undergo relatively rapid degradation compared to messenger RNAs from constitutively expressed genes. A T cell activation pathway that specifically regulates the stability of messenger RNAs for the lymphokines interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is induced by stimulation of the CD28 surface molecule. This pathway does not directly affect the steady-state messenger RNA level, transcription, or messenger RNA half-life of other T cell activation genes, including c-myc, c-fos, IL-2 receptor, and the 4F2HC surface antigen. These data show that stimuli received at the cell surface can alter gene expression by inducing specific changes in messenger RNA degradation.\r"

This clone is not derived from host DNA but from an RNA molecule present in NANBH infections that consists of at least 10,000 nucleotides and that is positive-stranded with respect to the encoded NANBH antigen. These data indicate that this clone is derived from the genome of the NANBH agent and are consistent with the agent being similar to the togaviridae or flaviviridae. This molecular approach should be of great value in the isolation and characterization of other unidentified infectious agents.\r"

HCV antibodies were detected in six of seven human sera that were shown previously to transmit NANBH to chimpanzees. Assays of ten blood transfusions in the United States that resulted in chronic NANBH revealed that there was at least one positive blood donor in nine of these cases and that all ten recipients seroconverted during their illnesses. About 80 percent of chronic, post-transfusion NANBH (PT-NANBH) patients from Italy and Japan had circulating HCV antibody; a much lower frequency (15 percent) was observed in acute, resolving infections. In addition, 58 percent of NANBH patients from the United States with no identifiable source of parenteral exposure to the virus were also positive for HCV antibody. These data indicate that HCV is a major cause of NANBH throughout the world.\r"

Pain levels were self-recorded by patients in the post-treatment period, and follow-up physical examinations were performed and data were collected regarding hospital stay and return to activities for 3 months post-treatment. Patient's pain perception post-treatment was statistically lowest in the surgically treated group. The enzyme-injected patients reported higher levels of pain perception throughout the follow-up period, with collagenase-treated patients reporting more pain than chymopapain patients. Surgical patients had the most satisfactory outcome of treatment at 3 months. An explanation regarding the differences in pain response to the two enzymes is offered based on in vitro studies of the effects of the enzymes on the two major structural macromolecules of the connective tissue matrix.\r"

Four were successfully treated with nasojejunal feedings only, and nine underwent a derotation procedure designed to alleviate the problem of compression of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery. Of the nine patients who were operated upon, only one required a gastrojejunostomy to bypass a persistent obstruction. Therapy was aimed specifically toward the problem of duodenal occlusion at the mesenteric root. Because this therapy was successful in all of the patients, we conclude that SMAS exists as a treatable entity and must be considered in any adolescent patient who presents with symptoms of obstruction of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and failure to thrive.\r"

  ".U": "89222700\r", 
  ".W": "The Medicare system of prospective payment to hospitals based on diagnostic related groups (DRG) has been severely criticized at a number of levels. Many states are using DRG prospective \"All Payor Systems\" for reimbursement to hospitals with the federal DRG system as a model. In All Payor Systems, Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross and other commercial insurers pay by the DRG mode; the state of New York has been All Payor since 1 January 1988. This study simulated DRG All Payor methods on a large sample (N = 17,560) of surgical patients for a two year period, using both federal and New York DRG reimbursement methods currently in effect. Both Medicare and Medicaid patients had, on average, a longer length of stay in the hospital and higher total cost of hospitalization compared with patients from Blue Cross and other commercial payors. Medicare and Medicaid patients also had a greater severity of illness compared with patients from Blue Cross or other payors. All except commercial insurors (that is, Medicaid, Blue Cross and Medicare) had greater financial risk under the DRG All Payor scheme. Results from our study suggest that federal, state and private payors may not be adequately reimbursing health care providers for the care of the hospitalized surgical patient under the DRG prospective scheme of hospital payment. It appears that the financing policy for health care, especially at the federal and state level, could limit both the access and quality of care for surgical patients.\r"

Length of postoperative hospitalization, use of postoperative analgesia and return of gastrointestinal tract function were similar in both groups. A total of 43 patients from both groups were discharged within 48 hours of operation. Two complications of the gastrointestinal tract occurred in those in group 1, and none occurred in group 2.

Seminal plasma transferrin concentration in the pregnancy-proved normozoospermic group was 78.5 +/- 37.9 micrograms/mL, and the concentration in the patients with idiopathic oligozoospermia was 44.4 +/- 37.6 micrograms/mL. There was a significant difference between them (P less than 0.01). The patients with idiopathic oligozoospermia could be divided into two subgroups according to seminal plasma transferrin concentration and serum gonadotropin levels. One group had high transferrin levels with elevated serum gonadotropin levels. The results indicate that the determination of seminal plasma transferrin concentration is one of the useful parameters for evaluation of testicular function and also suggest that additional studies may allow for the subdivision of the patients with so-called idiopathic oligozoospermia.\r"

Findings were: (1) older patients (70+) had higher total hospital costs (+12,022 per patient) than younger patients (70-) (+9,872 per patient); (2) a longer hospital length of stay (14.2 days vs 11.6 days); (3) financial risk of +1,756 loss per (70+) patient vs +1,309 profit per (70-) patient (p less than 0.05); (4) more diagnoses and procedures per patient, and (5) a higher mortality (4.0% vs 3.3%). These findings suggest that the current DRG scheme may be inequitable vis-a-vis the older urology patient in non-age stratified DRGs, and thus could limit access and quality of care for these patients in the future.\r"

  ".W": "Reduced patient morbidity and broadened surgical experience have increased the use of radical prostatectomy for carcinoma of the prostate. Urologists generally agree that patients with palpable lesions confined within the prostate are suitable candidates for the procedure. Ninety-one percent of patients with clinical Stage B1 tumors treated at the University of Utah are alive and free of disease at five years, but this figure decreases to 52 percent at ten years. For Stage B2 tumors, five- and ten-year disease-free survival figures are 81 and 50 percent, respectively. Increasing enthusiasm for radical prostatectomy in patients with Stage A1 tumors is based on a projected 8-18 percent possibility of disease progression. On the other hand, the likelihood that Stage A1 patients will not progress, the inability to predict accurately the small group of patients in whom problems will develop, and the probability that radical prostatectomy does not cure all patients who are at risk for progression argue against radical surgery for most Stage A1 patients. There is little rationale for surgery alone in patients with known extracapsular tumor extension when surgical margins are likely to be positive. Whether adjuvant radiation treatment or hormonal therapy will improve results is uncertain, but appropriate clinical trials to answer these questions have been initiated.\r"

This is best illustrated in four separate series of patients with Stages A and B cancer with negative lymph node dissections treated with radiation. These data are compared with the Uro-Oncology Group trial of radical prostatectomy versus external beam radiation therapy in which the radiation therapy arm behaved like Stage C cancer. Comparison of fifteen-year results for patients with B1 nodules of unknown lymph node status (Gibbons, Jewett and Bagshaw) show survival of 51 to 55 percent at fifteen years despite the fact that the radiation therapy group treated all states of health and histology. The national averages for treatment of all histology and states of health for Stage B patients is 16 percent below age-group expected survival at ten years. Patients with Stage A cancer treated with external beam radiation exactly match their age-group expected survival. Similar national averages for ten-year survival for 313 T1 (early Stage B) patients is within 11 percent of expected survival at ten years even though 30 patients had poorly differentiated tumors. The real question in early prostate cancer is a comparison of complications of treatment. Comparison of the U.S. national averages for radiation therapy are reviewed along with the major surgical series.\r"

These peptides have a modified amino acid structure that makes them more potent than LHRH. Prolonged administration of LHRH agonists results in down-regulation of the LHRH receptors in the pituitary and decreased secretion of luteinizing hormone. The result is decreased production of testosterone by Leydig cells, which is the basis for the use of LHRH agonists to treat prostate cancer. The effectiveness of LHRH agonists has been demonstrated in the United States in several randomized, controlled clinical trials. Daily administration of leuprolide produced equivalent results compared with diethylstilbestrol (DES). More recently, in two separate, randomized studies, the long-acting LHRH agonist Zoladex (ICI Pharma, Wilmington, Delaware) produced the same objective response rate as DES or bilateral orchiectomy. The equivalent response rates obtained with LHRH agonists indicate that these drugs can now be considered a reasonable treatment option for patients with metastatic prostatic cancer.\r"

In the Zoladex versus orchiectomy trial, there was no significant difference between the treatment groups with regard to subjective and objective responses (British Prostate Group criteria), endocrine responses, clinical effects and side effects, time to treatment failure and death, or survival after similar median follow-up periods. It was concluded that depot Zoladex had behaved as a truly medical alternative to orchiectomy. In the Zoladex versus DES trial, subjective and objective responses (British Prostate Group and National Prostatic Cancer Project criteria), response duration and survival were similar. However, there was a more rapid response to treatment in the depot Zoladex group. Side effects from Zoladex such as flare symptoms during the initial stages of treatment required no discontinuation of therapy; in contrast, 15 percent of patients receiving DES required cessation of therapy during the first three months because of side effects. It was concluded that depot Zoladex was superior to DES in its attainment of an early objective response and in its absence of side effects, and that Zoladex was comparable with DES in terms of response rates and survival.\r"

Subjects comprised previously untreated Stage D prostate cancer patients for whom hormonal therapy was indicated. Thirteen institutions entered 159 patients into the study. After discussing treatment choices with their physicians, the patients took home a two-page letter explaining two options: surgical castration and therapy with Zoladex (goserelin acetate), a depot luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue injected subcutaneously every twenty-eight days. Patients were encouraged to discuss the treatment choices with their families. After selecting a treatment approach, patients completed a \"decision questionnaire\" and then treatment was initiated. Of the 147 patients who completed baseline questionnaires, 78 percent selected Zoladex and 22 percent selected orchiectomy. The primary reason for selecting Zoladex included avoidance of surgery (36%), success of treatment (18%), convenience of the drug (10%), and physician's advice (10%). Patients chose surgery primarily because of convenience (32%) and success of treatment (29%). Three months later, patients and their wives completed another questionnaire, which assessed their satisfaction with their treatment choices. Ninety-three percent of patients and 91 percent of patients' wives indicated that they would select the same treatment again.\r"

Control venous distensibility, measured after the inflation of an upper arm cuff to 30 mm Hg above cuff zero (VV[30]) was 2.69 +/- 1.26 (standard deviation) cc/100 cc arm. The VV[30] increased to 3.06 +/- 1.43 cc/100 cc arm after the administration of nitroglycerin. There was a significant relation between age and baseline venous distensibility (r = 0.53, p less than 0.001) and between age and the change in venous distensibility after nitroglycerin (r = 0.56, p less than 0.001).

A total of 212 patients were given isradipine at doses of 1.25 and 2.5 mg twice daily. Twelve hours after the last dose, diastolic blood pressure was reduced to no more than 90 mm Hg in 52.6 percent of patients treated with isradipine alone. After eight weeks of treatment, 30 percent of patients were also given guanfacine 1 mg daily. By Week 12, 67.6 percent of the patients had attained normotension. Compared with placebo, side-effect frequency was higher for flushing and edema with isradipine, and dry mouth was more frequent with added guanfacine. Electrocardiographic examinations and routine laboratory determinations showed no clinically relevant changes. These data indicate that isradipine as monotherapy and in combination with guanfacine is an effective antihypertensive agent. Most patients will continue to participate in a two-year follow-up involving bimonthly clinical visits and half-yearly electrocardiographic examinations and laboratory determinations.\r"

It is a potent antihypertensive drug when given as monotherapy. This was a randomized double-blind crossover study of 16 weeks' duration, including 80 hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressures of at least 95 mm Hg who had shown clinically relevant antihypertensive responses, but no normalization of blood pressure during pindolol 10 to 15 mg once daily as monotherapy. Either isradipine or placebo was added to the beta-blocker at doses of either 2.5 mg or 5 mg twice daily, which was doubled after four weeks if the diastolic blood pressure remained more than 90 mm Hg. The addition of isradipine (in either dose regimen) caused a pronounced reduction of blood pressure with no changes in heart rate. Five patients were withdrawn from the study because of adverse events while receiving isradipine compared with three taking placebo. A further three patients withdrew from the study because of adverse events (one patient) or lack of efficacy (two patients) during placebo treatment. These results indicate that isradipine is an effective and well-tolerated adjunct to beta-blockers in hypertensive patients.\r"

The average age was 50 years (range, 31 to 65 years). After all patients were given captopril 50 mg twice daily plus placebo for four weeks, they were randomly assigned into groups receiving in addition either placebo or isradipine 1.25 mg twice daily in increasing doses at four-week intervals. During Weeks 20 to 24, the captopril plus placebo group was given hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg per day. Blood pressure was measured in the morning, 12 hours after tablet intake. Supine blood pressure was reduced in the captopril plus isradipine group by -8/-6, -14/-9, -16/-8, and -11/-7 mm Hg compared with the placebo group. Changes in diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant at Week 8, whereas changes in systolic blood pressure were statistically significant at Weeks 12, 16, and 20. With the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (Weeks 20 to 24), only supine systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced. One patient was withdrawn from the trial due to a rash. The results indicate that combined treatment with a calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is effective in lowering blood pressure and that the combination is well tolerated during long-term therapy. The combination of captopril and isradipine was more effective than captopril given with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide.\r"

Each patient served as his or her own control, taking each drug in turn for two weeks. Both drugs lowered blood pressure to the same degree. During timolol treatment, however, platelet aggregation increased whereas isradipine resulted in a shortening of the euglobulin clot lysis time (p less than 0.05), indicating increased fibrinolytic activity. Platelet aggregation and fibrinolytic activity are modified by cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Since beta-adrenoceptors are present on platelets and endothelial cells, the differences in platelet behavior and fibrinolytic activity may reflect a decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate production caused by non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade.\r"

The greater the delay in isradipine administration after occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, the less these effects until no effect on infarct size was obtained when isradipine was injected six hours after occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. Blood pressure was dose-dependently reduced in spontaneously hypertensive rats (blood pressure more than 200 mm Hg), which received injections of isradipine subcutaneously 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg per day for six days, to approximately 150, 135, and 120 mm Hg, respectively. Twelve hours post-injection, the left middle cerebral artery was occluded. Isradipine also dose-dependently decreased infarct size, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging at 24 hours and histology five days later, by approximately 20, 40, and 60 percent, respectively, compared with vehicle-injected controls. These results suggest that isradipine, at doses required to normalize the high blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, will substantially reduce the infarct size caused by a later stroke.\r"

  ".W": "Dose-response curves of isradipine for blood pressure, total peripheral conductance, and regional cerebral conductances and blood flows were obtained in anesthetized cats and rabbits using the microsphere method. Cerebrovascular effects occurred at lower doses than systemic effects, and the effective duration was longer in the brain than in the periphery. In a rat model of embolic stroke (unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery), isradipine has been shown to have cytoprotective efficacy (Sauter A, Rudin M: Stroke 1986; 17: 1228-1234; Rudin M, Sauter A, Wiederhold K-H: Therapie 1987; 42: 477-481; Sauter A, Rudin M, Wiederhold K-H: Neurochem Pathol 1989 [in press]). Using this model, dose-response curves for infarct size, measured by magnetic resonance imaging, and biochemical markers of infarction were obtained for various calcium antagonists. Isradipine showed the biggest improvements (50 to 60 percent at 2.5 mg/kg subcutaneously), followed by nimodipine (30 to 40 percent at 5 mg/kg subcutaneously), nitrendipine (30 to 40 percent at 10 mg/kg subcutaneously), darodipine (20 to 30 percent at 10 mg/kg subcutaneously), and nicardipine (10 percent at 10 mg/kg subcutaneously). It is concluded that isradipine differs in both efficacy and potency from the other calcium antagonists tested. The effects of isradipine, nimodipine, and darodipine on cerebral blood flow were further investigated in this model using the [14C]iodoantipyrine method. Despite systemic hypotension, cerebral blood flow was dose dependently increased in the normal and ischemic hemispheres. Isradipine elicited maximal improvements over a wider dose range than the other drugs tested (0.1 to 2.5 mg/kg), preferentially affecting cerebral blood flow in the ischemic areas, as further demonstrated using autoradiographic techniques. These effects are in good, quantitative agreement with the reductions in infarct size, observed by magnetic resonance imaging and histology, emphasizing the importance of cerebrovascular mechanisms for cytoprotection in stroke. The concurrence between cat, rabbit, and rat experiments suggests that the findings may also apply to humans.\r"

Both groups achieved significant and sustained reductions in systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure (-15 percent/-12 percent and -15 percent/-20 percent, respectively; p less than 0.001). Renal parameters were investigated two to three hours after the morning dose of isradipine, using a water-loading procedure. After 3.5 months of treatment, the glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow showed small increases (+6 percent and +9 percent, respectively, p less than 0.05), whereas, after two years, these changes were no longer present (+4 percent and 0 percent). Clearance of sodium and uric acid was increased by 40 percent (p less than 0.01) and 21 percent (p less than 0.01), respectively, after 3.5 months, and by 45 percent (p less than 0.05) and 23 percent (p less than 0.01), respectively, after two years. Lithium clearance studies revealed the natriuretic effect to be located in the proximal tubule. After 3.5 months, a significant relationship was found between the blood pressure response and the change in sodium excretion, but this relationship also was no longer present after two years. In conclusion, because of a maintained blood pressure-lowering effect while preserving renal function, and sustained natriuretic and uricosuric actions, isradipine can be considered a promising agent in the long-term treatment of arterial hypertension.\r"

The blood pressure-lowering effect of isradipine as monotherapy is dose dependent and has shown a greater efficacy than propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and prazosin, without an increase in adverse effects. Combination therapy with a beta-blocker is also safe and offers a useful additional reduction in blood pressure. Indeed, the side effects are no more frequent than with placebo (in doses below 10 mg daily); they are also dose dependent and appear to diminish with time. Isradipine's antiatherogenic effects and cardiac protection potential require further evaluation in clinical studies, but add an interesting aspect to the drug. Against this background, isradipine appears to be a useful addition to our therapeutic arsenal and has the potential to become the drug of choice in the treatment of hypertension.\r"

In cats, the calcium antagonist isradipine reduced AV-shunt flow; verapamil showed a similar tendency and nicardipine was without effect. Dihydralazine strongly increased, but nitroglycerin and dipyridamole decreased AV-shunt flow. In rabbits, the effects of isradipine and verapamil were similar to those seen in cats. Sodium nitroprusside had no effect, whereas prazosin, minoxidil, and the potassium-channel activator cromakalim increased AV-shunt flow. The contrasting effects of drugs sharing the same mechanism of action suggest that target-tissue selectivity is more important than the mechanism of action. An increase of AV-shunt flow is unlikely to be beneficial but could be associated with a number of undesirable side effects. It might negatively affect migraine sufferers and, if AV-shunt dilatation shows no tolerance development, it represents an unnecessary hemodynamic burden for the heart.\r"

Differences in the sensitivity of several vasoconstrictors to the constrictor effect of calcium antagonists were quantified in experiments on rats and rabbits. In rats, the dose-response curves for pressor effects to angiotensin II were shifted in parallel to the right after treatment with isradipine, but not with prazosin and dihydralazine, suggesting that the antivasoconstrictor effect of isradipine was of a specific type. Blood pressure increases elicited by angiotension II or norepinephrine (alone, or with propranolol or propranolol plus prazosin) were also measured in rabbits and, again, isradipine caused parallel shifts of the dose-response curves. Both agonists thus appear to stimulate calcium entry, at least in resistance vessels, and via the same pathway, the L-type calcium channel. However, the angiotension II pressor effects were more sensitive to isradipine than those of norepinephrine in the presence of propranolol, and even more so in the presence of propranolol plus prazosin. These results suggest subtle and as yet unexplained differences, possible related to the activity of the adenylate cyclase system, in the chain of events leading to activation of the L-channels in vivo.\r"

At the end of the study, 12 patients were evaluable in the isradipine group and nine in the atenolol group. Assessments at baseline and after 20 weeks of treatment included arterial and venous compliance, mean peripheral perfusion pressure, heart rate, and digital vascular resistance using photoplethysmography. Isradipine had a direct relaxing effect on the arterioles, revealed by a significant increase in arterial compliance and a concomitant normalization of the digital vascular resistance. Atenolol had no significant effect on these parameters but, as expected, it lowered the heart rate, which was not affected by isradipine in the long term. The venous compliance remained low in both groups and, since isradipine--unlike atenolol--is known to have venodilating properties in vitro, its lack of effect in vivo is most likely due to reflex activation of sympathetically mediated venous tone. Because of the preference of isradipine for the arterial side of the peripheral vascular tree, the mean peripheral perfusion pressure remained higher in this group than in the atenolol group, although central systemic blood pressure was lowered equally and satisfactorily in both groups.\r"

Compared with placebo, isradipine reduced ambulatory blood pressure from 174/104 to 154/91 (p less than 0.001), whereas the heart rate was unchanged. The reduction of blood pressure was entirely due to a reduction (36 percent; p less than 0.001) of the peripheral resistance. The baroreceptor sensitivity did not change (RR intervals during infusion of phenylephrine) but, with isradipine, the setpoint was shifted to lower blood pressure levels. Renal plasma flow (para-amino hippurate clearance) increased (465 versus 391 ml/minute; p less than 0.05), but glomerular filtration rate ([51Cr]ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid clearance) did not change. Hence, the filtration fraction decreased. With isradipine, there was a post-dose increase in natriuresis (0.45 to 0.34 mmol/minute; p = 0.06). Side effects were mild.\r"

The patients maintained a constant daily intake of 100 mmol of sodium and 40 mmol of potassium. Placebo and isradipine were randomly administered to each patient, according to a Latin-square design, at intervals of at least 48 hours. The antihypertensive effect was dose-dependent and peaked at two hours after oral administration; changes at the lowest dose were already statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Increases in heart rate were mild and similar with all isradipine doses. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow showed a trend towards a dose-dependent rise; plasma renin activity was statistically increased (p less than 0.05) following the highest isradipine dose, whereas plasma aldosterone was unmodified. Isradipine resulted in a statistically significant rise (p less than 0.05) in sodium excretion and urine volume, which was similar with all active doses. In conclusion, the antihypertensive efficacy of isradipine is dose-dependent, whereas the natriuretic and diuretic effects are already at maximum following 2.5 mg per day, the lowest dose in this study.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to examine the effect of antihypertensive treatment on the structure of intramyocardial resistance vessels in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The rats were divided into four groups: one was used as control and the other three were treated from the age of four to 24 weeks with isradipine, hydralazine, and metoprolol, respectively. Half of the animals in each group were examined at the end of active treatment and the rest were examined three weeks later. The rats were anesthetized and killed during constant flow perfusion with 1 percent glutaraldehyde. The media index was determined by point counting. The media indices of rats treated with isradipine and hydralazine were significantly smaller than those of age-matched spontaneously hypertensive rat controls, whereas the media indices of rats in the metoprolol group did not differ significantly. Three weeks after treatment withdrawal, the media index tended to increase in all three groups, but the values for the isradipine and hydralazine groups were still significantly reduced. Non-invasive blood pressure measurements taken at the same time demonstrated a significant blood pressure reduction in all groups, although differences within each treatment group were evident. All pressures had stabilized on the level of spontaneously hypertensive rats three weeks after withdrawal. Thus, it is evident that both isradipine and hydralazine were able to prevent hypertrophy of intramyocardial vascular structure and continue to do so even after treatment withdrawal. This finding is consistent with previous findings, suggesting a close relationship between the extent of blood pressure reduction and the degree of prevention of vascular hypertrophy.\r"

The effects of 10 mg oral isradipine were maximal after two to three hours with significant decreases in blood pressure as well as in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, and an increase in cardiac output. There were no significant changes in heart rate or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. For the same 50-watt bicycle workload pre- and post-drug, the addition of isradipine was associated with lower systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances (systemic vascular resistance, 805 +/- 70 versus 975 +/- 70; p less than 0.01; pulmonary vascular resistance, 144 +/- 27 versus 207 +/- 35 dynes.sec.cm-5; p less than 0.01), and lower pulmonary artery pressures (54 +/- 6/23 +/- 3 versus 66 +/- 7/27 +/- 3 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) during exercise. In a double-blind 12-week trial, body weight decreased during isradipine treatment (71.6 to 68.9 kg; p less than 0.01), but there were no significant changes in exercise duration, radionuclide ejection fraction, or cardiothoracic ratio, and no serious side effects were encountered. These results suggest that isradipine is worthy of further evaluation in long-term treatment of chronic ischemic congestive heart failure.\r"

A comparative study followed, comprising 20 patients randomly assigned to receive isradipine (starting at 0.6 microgram/kg/minute) or nitroprusside (initially 1 microgram/kg/minute) for the treatment of post-aortocoronary bypass graft hypertension. Both drugs produced a satisfactory reduction in arterial blood pressure accompanied by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Central venous pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased with nitroprusside, but both increased with isradipine. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was reduced, heart rate increased, and cardiac output was minimally changed with nitroprusside. However, wedge pressure was maintained with isradipine and there was no tachycardia. An increase in cardiac output was seen, associated with an increase in stroke index. Isradipine is a more specific treatment for post-aortocoronary bypass graft hypertension than nitroprusside because its systemic arterial dilating effect is associated with a minimum of other circulatory changes.\r"

  ".W": "Isradipine is a new dihydrophyridine calcium antagonist with powerful vasodilating properties. Although therapeutic concentrations do not affect myocardial contractility in vivo, in vitro studies have demonstrated a negative chronotropic action with only minor dromotropic influence. In humans with normal sinus and atrioventricular node function, even in the presence of beta-blockade, such a negative chronotropic effect could not be proved. No data are available on the effects of isradipine on a compromised sinus node. Therefore, the effect of intravenous isradipine at 0.3 microgram/kg/minute for 30 minutes was studied in seven patients with the clinical signs of a sick sinus syndrome. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 126 +/- 21 to 113 +/- 15 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Spontaneous sinus cycle length decreased from 969 +/- 22 to 843 +/- 161 msec (p less than 0.05). Changes in sinoatrial conduction time, sinus node recovery time, and corrected sinus node recovery time were not significant. Changes in atrioventricular node function, as reflected by the atrioventricular node functional refractory period, the atrial-His interval, the His-ventricle interval, and Wenckebach point were not significant. Also, effective refractory periods of atrium and ventricle, and QRS duration changed but not significantly. The QT interval decreased (419 +/- 45 to 405 +/- 44 msec; p less than 0.05), and there was a slight (not significant) increase of QTc interval (429 +/- 41 to 443 +/- 37 msec; not significant). It is concluded that isradipine in hemodynamically effective doses has no depressant effect on sinus and atrioventricular node function in patients with sick sinus syndrome.\r"

Three conclusions were derived from the pooled data: (1) A marked increase in efficacy is seen when the reduction in diastolic blood pressure after one week of treatment is compared with that seen after five weeks of treatment, with both placebo and active treatment. Thus, dose increases should preferably be made at intervals of at least four weeks to avoid unnecessarily high doses. (2) Isradipine 2.5 mg twice daily offers an efficacy of approximately 80 percent of the maximum with an incidence of adverse events which, statistically, is not significantly different from the incidence seen in the placebo groups. (3) With continued treatment, a marked decrease in the incidence of adverse drug reactions is seen between the first and fifth weeks, especially with doses at 1.25 and 2.5 mg twice daily. However, with doses above 10 mg per day, this effect is no longer evident.\r"

Isradipine alone was taken by 321 patients, the remainder receiving, in addition, other antihypertensive drugs. In valid patients receiving monotherapy, the mean final isradipine dose was 3.4 mg (median, 2.5 mg) twice daily, which normalized supine diastolic blood pressure in 85 percent and 64 percent of patients two to four hours and 10 to 14 hours post-dose, respectively. Overall, 242 patients (40 percent) reported adverse events, 39 (7 percent) of whom withdrew from the study for this reason. The most common side effects were flushing (11 percent), headache (10 percent), and localized edema (4 percent). None of the pathologic changes in hematologic or biochemical values was attributable to isradipine. It is concluded that a slow titration of isradipine by increments at three-week intervals results in an effective and well-tolerated treatment for essential hypertension, both in mono- and combination therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: In 1985, we reported that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed in 14 of 81 (17%) men with generalized lymphadenopathy followed prospectively for an average of 13 months. The presence of oral thrush or constitutional symptoms, or both, or severely impaired T4+ cell responses to specific antigen (interferon-gamma production) accurately identified patients at immediate risk for AIDS. The purpose of the current report is to describe the progress of these 81 patients during the three and a half years since enrollment and to include new data on initial serum levels of beta 2 microglobulin and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The mean age of the 81 patients was 35.4 years; 79 were homosexuals and two were drug abusers. Immunologic testing was performed once at the time of enrollment in all patients. Seventy-seven of the 81 patients were seropositive for HIV antibody. Frozen samples of serum, also obtained at initial study, were assayed in 1988 for beta 2 microglobulin and HIV p24 antigen. The clinical status of patients was determined six, 14, and 36 months after enrollment was closed (June 1984) by either interview and examination or telephone contact with private physicians. RESULTS: After three and a half years of follow-up, 42 patients have developed AIDS, including (1) 77% who had had thrush or symptoms, or both, (2) 80% to 88% of those who originally demonstrated marked immunologic abnormalities (skin test anergy, less than 200 T4+ cells/mm3, T4/T8 cell ratio of less than 0.5, severely impaired interferon-gamma production [less than 25 U/mL], or elevated serum beta 2 microglobulin level [greater than 3.0 mg/L], and (3) 95% of patients with HIV p24 antigenemia. However, AIDS also developed in 51% of patients who had had more apparently benign initial manifestations (lymphadenopathy alone, herpes zoster), in 41% to 54% despite normal initial results for either T4+ cell number, interferon-gamma secretion, beta 2 microglobulin, or skin testing, and in 44% of those whose sera did not contain HIV antigen. CONCLUSION: These updated results demonstrate the remarkably poor prognosis of patients with generalized lymphadenopathy or AIDS-related complex irrespective of initial clinical, immunologic, and serologic findings, and suggest that essentially all such persons may be candidates for antiviral therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Although flexible sigmoidoscopy is recommended in patients over age 40 to complement fecal occult blood screening for colorectal neoplasia, the yield of this procedure in asymptomatic, average-risk subjects has varied between studies. In addition, the efficacy of flexible sigmoidoscopy in detecting early curable carcinoma has been the subject of debate. We therefore undertook this study to assess the efficacy, safety, and cost of the procedure for early detection of colorectal neoplasia in asymptomatic subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Flexible sigmoidoscopy with a 60-cm scope was performed in 412 asymptomatic veterans (mean age, 63.2 years). Subjects with positive fecal occult blood and those at increased risk for colorectal neoplasia were excluded. Costs were estimated on the basis of Medicare payments. RESULTS: A mean length of 56.1 cm of sigmoid and descending colon was examined. A total of 132 polyps were detected in 93 subjects (22.6%). Thirty-five percent of the polyps were located at a distance of greater than 30 cm from the anal verge. Of 122 polyps removed, 26% were 1 cm in size or larger. A total of 77 polyps (63%) were adenomas, and six polyps (5%) were carcinomas. Of the six carcinomas detected (two carcinoma in situ, one Astler Coller stage A, two stage B1, and one stage C1), five were in a localized stage and thus potentially curable. The cost of detecting each potentially curable carcinoma was $47,174. No complications from flexible sigmoidoscopy were noted. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, 60-cm flexible sigmoidoscopy is a safe, high-yield procedure for the initial screening of colorectal neoplasia in asymptomatic, average-risk subjects over the age of 50. Because the carcinomas detected were still in an early stage, such screening may improve survival.\r"

The percent time of fetal breathing movements correlated significantly with maternal end-tidal PCO2, increasing with maternal breathing of 2% and 4% carbon dioxide and decreasing with maternal hyperventilation for each of the three gestational age groups studied. However, the slope of this response for the 28- to 30-week group (3.29) and for the 32- to 34-week group (3.66), although similar to that of the term fetus, was significantly greater than that for the 24- to 26-week group (1.18, p less than 0.001). We conclude that the carbon dioxide level in the preterm fetus (as in the term fetus) is an important stimulus for the generation of respiratory movements. However, a developmental change is evident; the 24- to 26-week fetus demonstrates a decreased respiratory response to tonic carbon dioxide input. This may account for the decreased incidence of fetal breathing movements in the fetus of younger gestational age.\r"

Cortisol increased both surfactant pools only when administered on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth gestational day. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone, whether administered in single or multiple doses, had no effect on the extracellular pool but increased the intracellular pool; the magnitude of the response (approximately twofold) was similar to that observed with the cortisol response. All combinations of cortisol and thyrotropin-releasing hormone resulted in an increased response over either drug given alone. The greatest response (almost tenfold) resulted from cortisol administration at 24 days' gestation plus thyrotropin-releasing hormone administration at 24+ 25+ 26 days. These data demonstrate differential effects of glucocorticoids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone on developing lung and furthermore show that the timing of their combined treatment may be crucial to achieving maximal response.\r"

In contrast, no synergistic effects are observed on progesterone production by the same treatments. Treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone for 24 hours significantly decreases follicle-stimulating hormone-induced progesterone production by approximately 50%. Treatment of the cells with either follicle-stimulating hormone or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone stimulates prostaglandin E2 production at least tenfold in the same cultures. When follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone are present concomitantly, they synergistically enhance prostaglandin E2 formation (p less than 0.01). Similar effects are observed with the phorbol ester, 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, which causes a dose-dependent inhibition of progesterone production by follicle-stimulating hormone whereas follicle-stimulating hormone-stimulated prostaglandin E2 formation is enhanced. Thus luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone-induced activation of protein kinase C may play multiple roles (stimulatory or inhibitory) in hormone production in the ovary.\r"

Persistence of Dugbe virus for greater than or equal to 53 days in 5 species (Dermacentor andersoni, D. variabilis, Amblyomma americanum, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, and R. sanguineus) indicates that infection occurred. Viral titers were significantly higher in female vs. male D. variabilis, R. appendiculatus, and A. americanum after blood feeding. Blood feeding had no significant effect on the viral titers of either female or male R. sanguineus. D. andersoni males also exhibited no significant change in viral titers after blood-feeding, but 100% (20/20) of drop-off females and 96% (24/25) of post-oviposition females (36 days postinoculation) contained no detectable virus even though virus was still found in unfed specimens less than or equal to 124 days postinoculation. Virus was not recovered from greater than 30,000 1st generation progeny (eggs, larvae, nymphs, adults) collected as eggs from inoculated female D. andersoni, D. variabilis, R. sanguineus, and R. appendiculatus 27-51 days postinoculation. R. sanguineus and R. appendiculatus transmitted Dugbe virus to guinea pigs when allowed to feed 1-3 weeks postinoculation.\r"

Antibodies against 9 bunyaviruses were measured in 337 mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus, O. hemionus californicus, and O. hemionus inyoensis) and black-tailed deer (O. hemionus columbianus). More deer from high mountainous areas had neutralizing antibodies against Jamestown Canyon virus than did deer from low mountainous areas (23% vs. 9%; P less than 0.01). This finding is consistent with transmission by snow pool Aedes mosquitoes. Results for Jerry Slough virus were nearly identical to those for Jamestown Canyon virus, which is further evidence that these are strains of the same virus. Neutralizing antibodies against Northway virus were present in 26% of deer from high mountainous areas and 23% of deer from low mountainous areas, suggesting the involvement of a widespread vector, such as Culiseta inornata. Northway virus is not known to occur outside of Alaska and northwestern Canada. Low prevalences of antibodies were detected in deer to California encephalitis, La Crosse, and snowshoe hare viruses of the California serogroup; and Cache Valley, Lokern, and Main Drain viruses of the Bunyamwera serogroup.\r"

It appeared to result in a longer disease-free interval when compared with population-based results for patients with sigmoid cancer who had surgery alone. Our results paralleled those of the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) for combined adjuvant therapy of rectal cancer, who also indicated an advantage for long-term survival. Patients who received additional extended chemotherapy had at least the same percentage of favorable outcomes. Tumors above the peritoneal reflection also appeared to share the same improved results.

  ".W": "To better define the interrelationship of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB), we conducted three HIV serosurveys of inpatients and outpatients with confirmed or suspected TB in Kinshasa, Zaire. HIV seroprevalence in hospitalized sanatorium patients did not change significantly in serosurveys conducted in 1985 and 1987 (92/231 [40%] versus 85/234 [36%]). These proportions were significantly higher than the 17% HIV seroprevalence observed in a 1987 serosurvey of 509 consecutive patients with an initial diagnosis of pulmonary TB seen at an outpatient TB diagnostic center in Kinshasa (p less than 0.001). HIV seroprevalence was higher in sanatorium patients with extrapulmonary TB (22/46 [48%]) and suspected pulmonary TB (60/132 [45%]) than in patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB (94/287 [33%]) (p less than 0.02). Mycobacterium sputum isolation rates were similar in HIV-seropositive (28/34 [82%]) and HIV-seronegative patients (135/159 [85%]). All isolates were Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Eighteen (21%) of 84 HIV-seropositive sanatorium patients in 1987, who were followed for two months after admission, had died, compared with 11 (9%) of 128 HIV-seronegative patients (p less than 0.01). However, clearance rates of acid-fast bacilli from sputum after standard therapy were equally good in HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative survivors. With the growing AIDS problem, the serious TB burden in sub-Saharan Africa may become even more onerous and may critically overload the stressed African health care systems.\r"

Patients who had acid-fast bacilli seen on sputum smears and patients who had received adequate therapy for tuberculosis in the past were excluded from the analysis. Accuracy of the diagnosis was determined by comparison of clinical and radiographic findings after 3 months of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol, as well as the results of sputum cultures. Of 139 patients started on therapy presumptively, 66 (48%) were determined to have current tuberculosis (16 had positive cultures, 43 because of improvement in their chest films, and 7 because of clinical improvement). Adverse reactions requiring change of therapy occurred in six of 72 (8.3%) patients determined to have inactive tuberculosis. One patient had both tuberculosis and carcinoma found at bronchoscopy after 3 months of therapy. For purposes of comparison, chest radiographs of 59 patients documented by culture to have current tuberculosis were reviewed. Of these, 45 (70%) were improved at 3 months. Presumptive therapy is of benefit in that it stops progression of the disease at an early stage and decreases the potential for spread of tuberculous infection. In addition, such therapy coupled with systematic reevaluation of patients substantiates the diagnosis or indicates that further evaluation is needed. These benefits must be weighed against the adverse reactions and costs of overtreating patients with inactive disease. Determining the appropriateness of presumptive therapy must be based on local factors including prevalence of tuberculosis and available resources.\r"

In the present study, the relaxant effects of glyceryl trinitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, sodium nitroprusside, and isoproterenol were measured and compared in vitro in airway preparations isolated from variously sized airways in bovine lung. Strips of trachealis from cervical and thoracic ends of the trachea and rings of intrapulmonary bronchi of various diameters (14 to 1 mm outer diameters) were mounted for recording of isometric tension. Submaximal tone was induced using 10(-6) M carbachol, and responses to cumulatively increasing concentrations of glyceryl trinitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, sodium nitroprusside, or isoproterenol were measured. Isoproterenol (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) was equiactive as a relaxant in all preparations. Glyceryl trinitrate (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) relaxed trachealis, but was progressively and significantly less effective as a relaxant as the diameters of the bronchial rings decreased. Although less potent than isoproterenol, sodium nitroprusside (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) was effective in relaxing all the airway preparations. Similar to glyceryl trinitrate, sodium nitroprusside was less effective in small than in large airways. However, the relationship between relaxant responses to sodium nitroprusside and airway size was not as marked as for glyceryl trinitrate. Isosorbide dinitrate at concentrations as great as 10(-5) M did not relax carbachol-induced tone in any of the bronchial rings and only induced a small amount of relaxation in trachealis at 10(-5) M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

From January 1984 through December 1986, 517 verified cases of tuberculosis were reported from the county. Drug susceptibility test results to isoniazid, streptomycin, ethambutol, and rifampin were available for 256 of the 517 cases. The frequency of resistance of M. tuberculosis isolates to one or more drugs was 27% for all cases and 25% for those who had had no previous antituberculosis treatment. Isolates from Asian immigrants had the highest frequencies of resistance (33 to 45%), and the Southeast Asian immigrants had a drug-resistant tuberculosis case rate greater than 30/100,000 population per year. In patients who had cavitary lung disease and who had a previous history of tuberculosis, drug-resistant tuberculosis was 3.5 times as likely to occur than in persons who had neither of these characteristics (p less than 0.001). For such patients, the positive predictive value of isolating resistant M. tuberculosis approached 90%. We believe these community-based findings will guide clinical and public health interventions specifically appropriate for the community.\r"

DESIGN: Factor VIII activity and inhibitor titer were measured before and after FVIII-CVP therapy and patients with factor VIII inhibitor were followed for at least 2 years. SETTING: The first course of therapy was carried out in the hospital when nonhemophiliac patients were admitted for bleeding. Otherwise, treatment was administered at the outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: From 1975 to 1986 we studied 12 nonhemophiliac and 5 hemophiliac patients with factor VIII inhibitor treated with FVIII-CVP and followed at our clinic. INTERVENTION: Patients were infused with one dose of factor VIII concentrate, 50 to 100 U/kg body weight, followed by cyclophosphamide, 500 mg on day 1 and 200 mg/d on days 2 to 5; vincristine, 2 mg on day 1; and prednisone, 100 mg/d on days 1 to 5. This regimen was repeated every 3 to 4 weeks. RESULTS: Of 12 nonhemophiliac patients, 11 responded after 1 to 3 courses of FVIII-CVP with complete disappearance of the inhibitor without recurrence. Among 5 patients with hemophilia who were given 3 to 8 courses, only 1 patient responded with a transient disappearance of inhibitor. Mild neutropenia and infection occurred in 3 patients and required antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSION: Factor VIII-CVP therapy is highly effective in the eradication of factor VIII inhibitor in nonhemophiliac patients but not in patients with hemophilia.\r"

We describe the effect of intravitreally administered 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OH-DA) on the pattern electroretinogram and pattern visual evoked potential of 3 aphakic monkeys. Because of the aphake condition, several complexities of intravitreal injection of 6-OH-DA could be avoided. Nevertheless, following 6-OH-DA treatment, both the phase and the amplitude of pattern electroretinogram and pattern visual evoked potential became abnormal. This abnormality was most pronounced for the higher spatial frequencies (2.5 and 3.5 cycles per degree), whereas lower spatial frequencies (0.5 and 1.2 cycles per degree) were less impaired. The effects of systemically administered MPTP on pattern electroretinogram and pattern visual evoked potential are similar to the effects of intravitreal injections of 6-OH-DA, suggesting that a retinal catecholaminergic system plays an important role in pattern vision of primates.\r"

Simple and complex absence seizures can occur in the same patient. The electroencephalographic features were distinct, with many interictal discharges, fragmentation of the paroxysms, and frequent polyspikes of varying numbers and amplitude for each spike-slow wave component. The combined clinical-electroencephalographic manifestations were characteristic and allow differentiation of absences in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy from typical absence seizures in other epileptic syndromes.\r"

Strain BM4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin B-type (MLS) antibiotics. The genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to MLS antibiotics in strain BM4165 were carried on plasmids pIP819 and pIP821, respectively; pIP819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to MLS antibiotics. The two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other E. faecium strains. Plasmid pIP819 could also conjugate to E. faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, S. pyogenes, S. lactis, and Listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to S. aureus. Glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. Based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.\r"

Microdilution MICs of ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, moxalactam, and ceftizoxime were therefore determined against ATCC and clinical strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus in Mueller-Hinton broth containing either human albumin (as 0, 2.5, or 5% solution) or heat-inactivated human serum (as 0, 25, 50, or 95% solution). Arithmetic linear dilutions were used to improve accuracy. For standard bacterial strains, MICs in the presence of 5% albumin were higher than in broth alone by multiples of 10.9 to 21 for ceftriaxone, 5.5 to 16.4 for cefoperazone, 1.9 to 3.7 for moxalactam, and 1.1 to 1.4 for ceftizoxime, as expected by their protein binding. MICs in the presence of 95% serum were similar to those in 5% albumin for all four drugs against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa but were 2.2- to 4.8-fold lower (P less than 0.001) against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Similar findings were observed at lower protein concentrations and with clinical isolates, except that for some strains of P. aeruginosa MICs were lower in serum than in albumin. Individual sera from five subjects gave comparable results. The addition of serum ultrafiltrate to albumin-containing solutions reduced MICs of ceftriaxone and cefoperazone 1.6- to 7.4-fold against E. coli and K. pneumoniae (P less than 0.01) but did not alter the MICs for S. aureus. Serum may contain an ultrafiltrable component(s) that enhances the activity of third-generation cephalosporins against many gram-negative bacilli.\r"

Exotoxin A, exoenzyme S, phospholipase C, elastase, and total protease activities were suppressed by antibiotics at concentrations as low as 1/20 of the MIC over a 24-h period in broth. Continuous 10-day exposure of P. aeruginosa DG1 broth cultures to antibiotic levels equal to 1/10 of the MIC reduced exoenzyme S activity in all treatment groups. Elastase activity was reduced only by ciprofloxacin and tobramycin treatment. This suppressive effect of the antibiotics persisted throughout the 10 days and was not influenced by the increase in MIC of ciprofloxacin detected during the course of the experiment. Rats chronically infected with P. aeruginosa were treated with subinhibitory doses of antibiotics and compared with untreated controls. Bacterial numbers in lung homogenates from each of the four study groups were identical. However, the lungs from antibiotic-treated rats had significantly less histological damage than those from control rats (P less than 0.001). The protective effect was greatest for ciprofloxacin and tobramycin. Further, P. aeruginosa isolates from ciprofloxacin- and tobramycin-treated rats demonstrated significantly less exoenzyme S and elastase activity than isolates from untreated rats (P less than 0.001). Isolates from ceftazidime-treated lungs expressed less exoenzyme S activity (P less than 0.001) but an equivalent amount of elastase activity as isolates from controls. The suppression of P. aeruginosa exoenzymes may arrest progressive lung injury during chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections.\r"

Results were compared with those obtained for 37 synergy-susceptible E. faecalis and 22 Enterococcus faecium strains. Although no substantial differences in quinolone activities were observed between synergy-resistant and -susceptible E. faecalis strains, CI-934 and ciprofloxacin were the drugs that demonstrated the greatest bactericidal activity against both types of E. faecalis. The MBCs of the other quinolones were generally within a single twofold dilution of the MICs, but their antienterococcal activity did not approach that of CI-934 or ciprofloxacin. The MBCs for 90% of the isolates of CI-934 for synergy-resistant and -susceptible E. faecalis strains were 1 and less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. The ciprofloxacin MBC for 90% of the E. faecalis strains tested was 1 microgram/ml. For E. faecium isolates the CI-934 and ciprofloxacin MBCs for 90% of the isolates were 8 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. Time-kill assays performed with synergy-susceptible enterococcal strains showed that the bactericidal activities of both CI-934 and ciprofloxacin were less than those of the penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations tested. However, against synergy-resistant isolates the activities of these two quinolones were comparable with and sometimes greater than those of penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations.\r"

Constitutively resistant bacteria are resistant to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B antibiotics. In this study, the MICs of several erythromycin and clarithromycin analogs against macrolide-susceptible and macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes strains were determined. Four 11,12-carbamate analogs of clarithromycin had lower MICs than erythromycin did against S. pyogenes with the inducible or constitutive type of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance. Five 11,12-carbonate analogs of erythromycin with modifications at the 4\" position of cladinose had lower MICs than did erythromycin against S. pyogenes with the constitutive type of resistance, and one of these compounds, which had a naphthyl-glycyl substitution at the 4\" position, had a lower MIC than erythromycin against both the inducibly resistant and constitutively resistant strains. Two analogs of erythromycin with a modification on the 4\" position of cladinose had lower MICs than erythromycin did against the constitutively resistant organisms but not against the inducibly resistant organisms. Thus, 14-membered macrolides can be modified so as to confer a low MIC when tested in vitro.\r"

There was no difference between groups in the proportion of patients in whom infection developed (chi 2[1] = 0.27; p = 0.6), the number of infection-related deaths (2 in each group), the types of infection (bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal), or the overall outcome.

The intravenous administration of nitroglycerin preoperatively is indicative of a more acute clinical situation, and allows for selection and analysis of a more homogeneous patient population. We reviewed the results of coronary artery bypass grafting for unstable angina defined as angina necessitating intravenous administration of nitroglycerin preoperatively. There were 129 patients (83 men and 46 women) with a mean age of 63.2 years (range, 36 to 86 years). Complications included operative death in 6.2%, postoperative low cardiac output in 11%, and perioperative myocardial infarction in 9%. Twenty perioperative variables were analyzed to identify risk factors for these end points. For operative death, age (p less than 0.05), cross-clamp time (p less than 0.05), and cardiopulmonary bypass time (p less than 0.001) were significant in the univariate analysis, but only age (p less than 0.05, F = 4.6) was an independent predictor using multivariate analysis (stepwise linear regression). For low cardiac output, univariate analysis demonstrated that cross-clamp time (p less than 0.01), preoperative use of an intraaortic balloon for angina (p less than 0.05), left ventricular score (p less than 0.05), number of diseased coronary vessels (p less than 0.05), and cardiopulmonary bypass time (p less than 0.001) were significant variables. However, only use of an intraaortic balloon for angina (p less than 0.0001, F = 14.3) and left ventricular score (p less than 0.005, F = 11.1) were significant independent predictors in the multivariate model. For perioperative myocardial infarction, only diabetes requiring insulin (p less than 0.005) was a significant predictor.\r"

The CMV was then visualized with a biotin-labeled CMV probe detected by a streptavidin peroxidase technique with aminoethyl carbazole as the chromogen. Factor VIII staining was a bright blue and CMV a brick red. The specimens included one small-bowel resection and four colonic resections, as well as an esophageal biopsy. The patients' diagnoses included bone marrow transplant recipient, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and renal transplant recipient. Cells positive for both CMV and factor VIII ranged from 35% to 60% of positive cells in a representative section, and the relative percentages (mean +/- SE) for cell type for infected cells were: endothelial, 48.9 +/- 4.5; vascular luminal (factor VIII negative), 6.1 +/- 1.7; perivascular (factor VIII negative in vascular wall), 16.2 +/- 3.2; and other cell (non-vascular factor VIII negative), 28.9 +/- 5.1.

  ".W": "The implications for medical education of a declining average length of stay (ALOS) and changes in numbers of hospital admissions have been the subject of considerable discussion. The changing hospital reimbursement schedules and the rise of managed-care systems have altered patterns of hospital use and consequently posed new problems for the education of medical students and residents. Between 1980 and 1986 in one university-affiliated hospital, the ALOS for patients with any of the most frequent discharge diagnoses for either of those years had declined 34% since 1980, despite a 59% increase in the number of patients with those diagnoses. Patients with any one of 21 of the 88 most frequent discharge diagnoses for 1986 were hospitalized for less than one day. Those patients with another eight of the disorders had an ALOSs of between one and two days; some of these patients had serious and common gastrointestinal disorders. Discharge diagnoses were categorized by the hospital service in which students and residents would have rotations and were analyzed for changes in case mix. This study showed that for the hospital's medical students and residents to be exposed to the same case mix of clinical disorders that were seen in-hospital in 1980, it is now necessary for them to have experience in the ambulatory setting.\r"

Major alterations in training programs have been recommended, including more training in ambulatory settings and minimizing house staff responsibility for procedure-oriented admissions. Almost no data have been collected regarding actual case-mix changes. In 1987, the author asked the faculty members of the Department of Medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine to assess the educational value of two groups of patients admitted to the same hospital 15 years apart, one group in 1971 and the other in 1986; the faculty members were not told the difference in dates or the study hypothesis. They found the group of patients from 1971 to have significantly greater educational value than the group from 1986. There were no differences in the estimations of \"sickness\" of the two groups of patients. These findings support the hypothesis that changes in patient populations resulting from recent economic changes may have diminished the educational value of medical inpatients in academic settings.\r"

We assayed for PLF using a 'sandwich' antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employing two monoclonal antibodies. Individuals with lymphadenopathy, with or without symptoms suggestive of AIDS-related complex, had the highest serum levels, which declined with progressive immunodeficiency. Total (normal) ferritins, in contrast, increased progressively with stage of disease. PLF was found on a subset of CD8 lymphocytes and appeared to block detection of the CD8 antigen by specific monoclonal antibodies. Elution of PLF by incubation with levamisole, but not by culture medium alone, led to the unblocking of the CD8 determinant on these cells. Profiles of isoferritins in HIV infection may provide clues to prognosis. PLF, a physiologic down-regulator of hematopoiesis and cellular immunity, could play a role in the progressive immune deficiency, marrow suppression and HIV expression that lead to AIDS.\r"

Maintenance of the rIFN-beta in culture is required since removal of the agent generally leads to a return of virus production by the infected cells. Moreover, at low concentrations of the drug, a breakthrough in HIV replication is observed. High concentrations of the rIFN-beta (greater than 100 units/ml) were cytotoxic for transformed T cells. This latter observations suggests that rIFN-beta might be useful in human T-cell malignancies. Beta interferon therefore might be useful for the treatment of HIV infection, particularly since side effects of the drug are limited in treated individuals.\r"

In both H9- and H9+ cells IFN exhibited a limited antiproliferative effect. There was activation of the 2'-5' oligo-A-synthetase (E enzyme) and the protein kinase enzyme systems, but low activation of the ribonuclease F was seen in both H9- and H9+ cells. From these results it can be concluded that IFN produces a limited antiviral and antiproliferative effect in both H9- and H9+ cells, and a defective ribonuclease F pathway might be responsible for this limited activity.\r"

Neither antibody-negative at-risk individuals nor HIV-infected individuals responded to HIV or its envelope-derived proteins, even though they responded to a recall antigen, purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD). However, five out of 14 antibody- and antigen-negative sexual partners of known HIV-positive men did respond to HIV, native gp 120 and recombinant envelope and core proteins. Some AIDS-related complex (ARC) and AIDS patients treated with zidovudine also showed a low T-cell response which diminished along with clinical deterioration. A synthetic peptide representing one of the major T-cell epitopes in HIV envelope, frequently recognized by immunized and infected primates, gave only marginal stimulation in man. Our findings suggest that HIV infection in man results in a T-helper cell anergy directed against viral proteins. The response observed in the antibody- and antigen-negative sexual partners and in some of the zidovudine-treated patients implies that at least some epitopes on HIV envelope are immunogenic in man.\r"

Of 191 at entry, 143 (75%) HIV-1-seropositive men remained anti-Neu21-negative during the follow-up period of 36 months. Thirty-seven (19%) HIV-1-seropositive men were persistently anti-Neu21-positive. Eleven (6%) HIV-1 seropositive men seroconverted for anti-Neu21 during follow-up. Of 75 men developing antibodies to HIV-1, 17 (23%) developed antibodies to Neu21. The incidence of anti-Neu21 seroconversion (calculated as attack rate) after 36 months was significantly lower (P less than 0.00001) among HIV-1-seropositive individuals (8%) than among the 75 HIV-1 seroconverters tested (25%), indicating that seroconversion to this neutralization domain occurs early during infection. AIDS and AIDS-related complex were diagnosed in 17% of the anti-Neu21 negatives and in 11% of the anti-Neu21 positives; this difference was not significant. The presence of HIV-1 antigen (29 versus 28%), the absence of antibodies to core proteins (45 versus 46%) and low CD4+ cell numbers (34 versus 40%) were not seen more frequently among anti-Neu21 negatives than among anti-Neu21 positives. These results argue against a role for antibodies to this LAV-1/HTLV-IIIB neutralization domain in protection against disease progression.\r"

Surveillance is passive and primarily hospital-based. At the end of July 1988, 5142 cases of AIDS had been reported to the Ministry of Health; 4583 (89%) had confirmatory HIV-antibody testing. Of the 4938 (96%) cases that had their sex recorded, 2358 (48%) were male and 2580 (52%) were female. The mean age of 28.4 years for male patients is higher than that of 24.4 years for female patients (P less than 0.0001). Only 18 (less than 1%) cases have been reported in children between 5 and 12 years of age. Case reports are returned via the District Medical Officers to the Ministry of Health where they are entered into a microcomputer from which a monthly report is generated for feedback to the reporting stations. Here we describe a simple national reporting system to follow the progression of the AIDS epidemic which could be established in Africa using limited resources.\r"

  ".W": "A multicentre cohort study was carried out to estimate the incidence of AIDS and HIV-related conditions in newly infected intravenous drug users (IVDU). The enrollment criteria included the identification of the seroconversion time. Two hundred and five subjects entered the study, and were followed for a mean of 26 months. Twelve subjects developed clinical AIDS over a 4-year period. The actuarial incidence of AIDS estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival technique was 17.8% by 4 years since seroconversion. The risk of developing AIDS increased significantly after 24 months from seroconversion. Relatively small figures accounted for the lack of statistical association between the risk factors investigated and the disease status.\r"

  ".W": "We analysed the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by monocytes in 11 drug addicts with AIDS and opportunistic infections and in 13 controls. In three patients and six controls we isolated the PGE2 fraction from culture supernatants of purified monocytes (greater than 95%) incubated in medium containing (3H) arachidonic acid, using silicic acid columns. In two of three patients PGE2-fraction values (21.9 and 21.6 pmol/g protein) were significantly higher than controls (10 +/- 4). In eight AIDS patients and seven controls, PGE2 levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay (HPLC and RIA). In three out of eight patients PGE2 levels were markedly higher (736, 419 and 208 pg/ml) than the mean + 2 s.d. values from controls (73 +/- 51). We tested the effect of PGE2 on the production of interleukin-2 by normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). There was a significant suppression of interleukin-2 production by PGE2 released from AIDS monocytes. PGE2 may be one of the factors involved in the severe immune dysfunction associated with AIDS.\r"
