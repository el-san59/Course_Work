  ".W": "To examine whether the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease associated with intrauterine device (IUD) use varies with a woman's sexual behavior, we analyzed data from the Women's Health Study, a hospital-based, case-control study carried out in the United States from 1976-1978. The cases were 657 women hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease; controls were 2566 women hospitalized with nongynecologic conditions. After controlling for confounding factors, we found no consistent differences in the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease associated with IUD use among women in different categories of gonorrhea history, frequency of intercourse, or number of recent sexual partners. However, among women with only one sexual partner, married and cohabiting women had little appreciable increased pelvic inflammatory disease risk associated with IUD use compared with those using no contraception, whereas previously and never-married women using IUDs had relative risk estimates of 1.8 and 2.6, respectively. These results suggest that women at low risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections have little increase in the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease from use of an IUD.\r"

In this report, we describe 28 complicated pregnancies cared for over a ten-year period at Parkland Memorial Hospital. In the group of 16 pregnancies in 14 overtly hypothyroid women, maternal complications were common and included anemia (31%), preeclampsia (44%), placental abruption (19%), postpartum hemorrhage (19%), and cardiac dysfunction. Perinatal morbidity and mortality were also high mainly because of placental abruption, and reflected frequent low birth weight (31%) and fetal death (12%). In a group of 12 women with subclinical hypothyroidism, these complications were less impressive. We speculate that overt thyroid deficiency is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome related to preeclampsia and placental abruption. Thyroxine replacement probably improves these outcomes even if subclinical hypothyroidism persists.\r"

In this investigation, we applied a widely accepted method of job analysis from personnel psychology, the critical incident technique, to define those behaviors and attitudes necessary for successful resident performance in obstetrics and gynecology. Nine mutually exclusive categories of behavior were identified, including conscientiousness, recognition of limits, confidence in skills and training, ability to handle crisis/emergency situations, integration of knowledge with practice, technical skills, relationships with staff, relationships with patients, and ethical actions. These categories appear to be reliable, as physician raters were able to sort incidents into appropriate categories with 94% reliability. Identification of these categories represents a beginning step toward determining necessary aspects of performance in a structured and replicable manner and toward defining these performance aspects in a manner that allows precise and reliable measurement.\r"

  ".W": "Fibronectin, a known growth factor for fibroblasts, is produced by alveolar macrophages from patients with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Because peritoneal macrophages have been implicated in the disease process of endometriosis, we measured the production of fibronectin by peritoneal macrophages in vitro and the concentration of fibronectin in peritoneal fluid samples. Twenty-nine patients had a normal pelvis, 22 had endometriosis, and 14 had tubal occlusion and/or adhesions. Human peritoneal macrophages demonstrated de novo synthesis of fibronectin. The peritoneal macrophage fibronectin was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum fibronectin. Peritoneal macrophages from patients with endometriosis produced approximately three times the amount of fibronectin as normal patients or patients with tubal occlusion and/or adhesions (P less than or equal to .01 and P less than or equal to .02, respectively). The mean peritoneal fluid concentration of fibronectin, however, was about 30% lower in patients with endometriosis than in normal patients (P less than or equal to .02). We suggest that increased peritoneal macrophage fibronectin production in patients with endometriosis may contribute to the adhesion formation and associated reactive fibrosis seen in this disease, and may also influence the implantation of endometrial cells and their subsequent growth in the pelvis.\r"

This prospective investigation was undertaken to determine the efficacy and safety of patient-controlled anesthesia infusion after cesarean section. During a recent ten-month period, 130 patients were assigned randomly to receive meperidine by pump or intramuscular injection. Meperidine consumption using the device varied widely to meet individual needs. Overdosage and drug dependence were not encountered with the prescribed drug concentrations. The patient-controlled analgesia method provided less sedation and more immediate pain relief without the need for painful injections. The additional cost of renting the infuser device was offset by combined patient and nursing satisfaction. We conclude that patient-controlled infusion of meperidine is safe and effective in satisfying individual patient needs after cesarean section.\r"

The proportion of mature values (fluorescence polarization 0.285 or lower) increased progressively from 12.5% at 27-28 weeks to 100% at 39-40 weeks. In the 31-36-week gestation group, the proportion of mature values in subjects with premature rupture of the membranes (84.6%) was significantly higher than in those with premature contractions (60%), severe pregnancy-induced hypertension (50%), mild pregnancy-induced hypertension (55.2%), diabetes class A (50%), insulin-dependent diabetes (60%), and other (63.5%). The mean +/- SD fluorescence polarization value was significantly lower in premature rupture of the membranes (0.256 +/- 0.030) than in premature contractions (0.274 +/- 0.032), mild and severe pregnancy-induced hypertension (0.280 +/- 0.027 and 0.280 +/- 0.035, respectively), and class A and insulin-dependent diabetes (0.285 +/- 0.018 and 0.277 +/- 0.030, respectively). The severity of pregnancy-induced hypertension and diabetes did not appear to influence either the fluorescence polarization value or the proportion of mature results. With the exception of a marked influence of premature rupture of the membranes, abnormal pregnancy conditions did not appear to have a significant effect on fluorescence polarization of amniotic fluid.\r"

Amniotic fluid was retrieved by transabdominal amniocentesis from three groups of patients. Group 1 (negative control) contained 14 women with term pregnancies without clinical and microbiologic evidence of infection of the amniotic cavity; group 2 (positive control) included 17 women with a positive Gram stain examination and culture of amniotic fluid; group 3 (study group) comprised 25 women at risk for intra-amniotic infection who had a negative Gram stain of amniotic fluid. None of the patients in group 1 and 16 of 17 patients (94.1%) in group 2 had pathologic short-chain organic acids in the amniotic fluid. Seven of the 25 patients in group 3 had a positive amniotic fluid culture and only two had an abnormal GLC pattern. Of the remaining 18 patients with negative amniotic fluid cultures, eight had abnormal GLC results. In group 3, the sensitivity of GLC was 28.5% and the specificity was 55.5%. Gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of amniotic fluid has limited clinical value in the prediction of amniotic fluid culture when the Gram stain examination is negative.\r"

One ureteroureterostomy leaked, but healed over a percutaneous stent without problems. All patients subsequently had normal renal function.\r"

The Maternal Mortality Collaborative reported 601 maternal deaths from 19 reporting areas for 1980-1985, representing a maternal mortality ratio of 14.1 per 100,000 live births. Overall, 37% more maternal deaths were reported by the Maternal Mortality Collaborative than by the National Center for Health Statistics for these reporting areas. Older women and women of black and other races continued to have higher mortality than younger women and white women. The five most common causes of death for all reported cases were embolism, nonobstetric injuries, hypertensive disease of pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, and obstetric hemorrhage. Compared with national maternal mortality for 1974-1978, ratios were lower for all causes except for indirect causes, anesthesia, and cerebrovascular accidents. Fatal injuries among pregnant women are not commonly reported to maternal mortality committees. As maternal mortality from direct obstetric causes continues to decline, clinicians will need to emphasize preventing deaths from nonobstetric causes.\r"

The three most frequent major diagnoses associated with primary cesarean delivery changed significantly over the study period. Fetal compromise became the most commonly associated diagnosis (from third), dystocia second (from first), and maternal disease third (from second). The categories of fetal positional abnormalities (fourth), abnormalities of placentation (fifth), and multiple pregnancy (sixth) did not change in rank. Primary cesarean delivery patients were compared with patients who delivered vaginally using odds ratios, prevalence, and population-attributable fractions. The risk factors of nulliparity, gestational age less than 37 weeks, late decelerations, and referral had the largest impact on the primary cesarean rate. Decreases in rates related to an increased tolerance of abnormalities of labor were overshadowed by the effects of increased concerns related to fetal health.\r"

This form of conventional cemented total hip replacement has provided pain relief and improved function in many individuals who have exhausted nonoperative treatment alternatives. Although there are still unsolved long-term problems for the young active patients, cemented hip arthroplasty continues to play an important role in joint replacement, and remains the treatment of choice in older and relatively inactive patients.\r"

Cemented resurface arthroplasty was not a successful enough operation to warrant its continued use (revision rate 44 per cent). The revision rate for all hips operated on 10 or more years ago was 7.0 per cent. In patients younger than fifty years of age, a revision rate of 19.6 per cent was observed after 10 years. Excessive body weight and heavy physical activity levels were frequently noted among the failures. Total hip arthroplasty should be done cautiously in patients under 50 and very rarely in patients under 30. Thirteen of the 25 revisions required in the early series were due to stem fracture, a complication rarely seen now with improved stem design and superalloy metallurgy. Despite radiologic identification of prosthesis loosening, revision THR may not be necessary for many years, if at all. Uncemented arthroplasty, particularly the acetabular component, seems to hold promise for the future; however, the experience to date is too limited to make any definite conclusions.\r"

With modern alloys, this should not be a long-term problem. Our data would suggest that the cemented arthroplasty can be used with confidence in patients 65 and older.

Electrical stimulation of the lateral medulla elicited analgesia in normal rats; the increase in pain threshold was proportional to the intensity and to the frequency of stimulation. In addition, microinjection of kainic acid or L-glutamate at the same sites also produced analgesia. However, generalized destruction of CNS 5-HT nerves produced by intraventricular injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) or selective destruction of spinal 5-HT nerves produced by intraspinal injection of 5,7-DHT reduced the magnitude of the antinociceptive responses to electrical stimulation. Postsynaptic blockade of CNS 5-HT receptors produced by intraventricular injection of cyproheptadine also reduced the stimulation-produced analgesia. The specificity of the lesions for 5-HT nerves is demonstrated by the lack of effect on the levels of noradrenaline in the same brain regions. The results indicate that the activity of 5-HT nerve cells adjacent to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata and projecting to the spinal cord serves to elevate pain threshold.\r"

Pain behavior was evaluated using a standardized observation method, and functional status was assessed using a modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ) and rheumatologists' ratings. Regression analyses revealed that a modified rheumatoid activity index and/or disease duration were significant predictors of levels of guarding, rigidity, and total pain behavior. The psychological variables examined did not predict independently RA pain behavior. The rheumatoid activity index explained a significant proportion of the variance in functional status ratings and MHAQ daily function scores. Age, disease duration and depression also were independent predictors of functional status ratings. Thus, depression had a significant relationship with physician ratings of functional status but not with patient self-reports of disability. Psychological factors not examined in this study that might influence RA pain behavior and self-reports of functional status are discussed.\r"

The most consistent (and inverse) relationship was found between substance P levels and the symptom 'inner tension' and between substance P levels and the personality trait 'psychic anxiety.'\r"

  ".W": "Back pain is a common condition and in most cases is not disabling. We have investigated disabling back pain that leads to health care utilization, time lost from work, and high costs. Disabling back pain remains of obscure origin because the focus in studying it has been too narrow. Our indicator of disability is the industrial insurance claim rate for back sprain by county (N = 39) in the State of Washington. After controlling for the size of the labor force and the proportion of workers in occupations that are particularly at risk of back sprain, we determined the effect of 3 socioeconomic factors on the claim rate: the unemployment rate, percentage receiving food stamps, and per capita income. For 2 of the 3 years studied, socioeconomic factors accounted for about one-third of the variance in the claim rate. Even though claimants of industrial insurance are employed, the unemployment rate was significantly related to the claim rate in the 3 years studied. Our interpretation is that disability is a symptom of distress. Where there is a rise in job insecurity and an attendant rise in economic insecurity, there is a greater likelihood that back pain will become disabling.\r"

Patients were also rated by their primary nurse on pain behavior, activity, drug-seeking, and sleep. Variables used to predict scores on outcome measures included patients' demographics and MMPI scores. Multiple regression analyses indicated that patients receiving worker's compensation engaged in more pain behavior and rated their pain as more severe, both upon admission and discharge from the pain program. High scores on the MMPI Hy scale were correlated with high self-ratings of pain and several MMPI scales correlated with negative mood. Even though demographic variables predicted admission and discharge scores on a number of treatment outcome measures, there was no relation between demographics and patients' improvement on treatment outcome measures. Patients with high scores on MMPI Hy and D scales displayed greatest admission to discharge improvement on self-rated pain and mood. Results were integrated with findings from previous studies. It was suggested that by distinguishing between overall scores on treatment outcome measures and improvement on these measures, professionals will be in a better position to devise individualized treatment plans for pain patients.\r"

A group of 30 normal subjects (15 doctors and 15 university students) was used to define 5 anchor words of the intensity verbal scale by means of a visual analogue scale, and a 5-point Present Pain Intensity (PPI) verbal scale was derived. For the semantic key, a first group of 80 subjects (30 university students and patients, respectively, and 20 doctors) was asked to sort out appropriate pain descriptors from 203 pain-related words with the help of clinical literature and Italian dictionaries. Subsequently, a second group of 80 subjects (of identical structural composition) was asked to allocate the 56 words previously chosen on the basis of word frequencies (at least 45%) to the most appropriate category in the Italianized MPQ. Testees were then asked to assign an intensity value to each word, using a VAS scale. The final pain vocabulary was formed from those words, which reflected a statistically significant intensity change (P less than 0.05) within each group. The IPQ comprises 42 pain descriptors, distributed into 3 major classes (sensory, affective and evaluative) and 16 subclasses. It represents the most parsimonious, meaningful and idiomatic set of Italian pain descriptors, providing quantitative information that can be treated statistically, yet preserving a close structural parallel with the MPQ.\r"

This depends upon the fact that some nociceptive neurones in the deep spinal grey matter have bilaterally symmetrical receptive fields, one-half of which is normally subject to tonic descending inhibitory control. It is suggested that some cordotomy lesions may damage this descending inhibitory pathway. Experience following naloxone injection in our own cases further suggests that this inhibitory mechanism may normally involve enkephalinergic interneurones.\r"

Although it was initially used pragmatically, there is now a reasonable rationale for its effectiveness that can be proposed based on more recent insights into the anatomy and neurophysiology of cutaneous nociceptors and the neuropharmacology of aspirin. In view of the widely held persuasion that the management of pain syndromes associated with herpes zoster (especially severe postherpetic neuralgia) is an unsatisfactory and frustrating venture, it seemed reasonable to report these more favorable clinical observations.\r"

To determine the influence of the forebrain on flexion reflexes in this model, responses to ankle and foot stimulation were examined in chronic decerebrate rats, decerebrated either before or after the induction of the arthritis. The increased responsiveness to stimulation of the arthritic ankle which had been observed after 24 h of urate arthritis was equally apparent in animals decerebrated 24 h before the induction of the arthritis and in those decerebrated 24 h after the urate injection. However, the decreased responsiveness of the distal foot to pressure or temperature stimuli, which had been observed in arthritic animals with an intact forebrain, was still apparent in animals decerebrated 24 h after the induction of the arthritis but did not appear in animals who had been decerebrated before the arthritis induction. It is concluded that the forebrain is required for the production of the reduced responsiveness of the distal foot but is not required for its maintenance once the insensitive state has been acquired.\r"

Hyperalgesic responses to noxious radiant heat were evident on the second postoperative day and lasted for over 2 months. Hyperalgesic responses to chemogenic pain were also present. The presence of allodynia was inferred from the nocifensive responses evoked by standing on an innocuous, chilled metal floor or by innocuous mechanical stimulation, and by the rats' persistence in holding the hind paw in a guarded position. The presence of spontaneous pain was suggested by a suppression of appetite and by the frequent occurrence of apparently spontaneous nocifensive responses. The affected hind paw was abnormally warm or cool in about one-third of the rats. About one-half of the rats developed grossly overgrown claws on the affected side. Experiments with this animal model may advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms of neuropathic pain disorders in humans.\r"

Eight patients received a stellate ganglion blockade with bupivacaine, and 14 days later an intravenous regional sympathetic blockade with guanethidine. The remaining patients served as controls and were randomly allocated to receive either a sham (placebo) injection with physiologic saline superficial to the stellate ganglion (n = 10) or bupivacaine intramuscularly (n = 10). The efficiency of the stellate ganglion blockade was evaluated by measuring skin blood flow (using a laser Doppler flowmeter), skin temperature, and skin conductance responses ('sympathogalvanic reflex'). Trigger and tender points (TePs) were counted, and rest pain in the arm, shoulder and neck evaluated at intervals up to 4 h after the injection. The guanethidine blockade was evaluated 24 h after the injection by counting TePs and by assessment of rest pain in the hand and forearm. The results indicate that a complete sympathetic blockade, produced by a stellate ganglion blockade, markedly reduced the number of TePs and produced a marked decrease in rest pain. The guanethidine blockade reduced the number of TePs, but had no effect on rest pain. The reduction in pain and TePs produced by a sympathetic blockade may be due to an improvement in microcirculation. Sympathetic activity may, in some patients, contribute to the pathogenesis of primary fibromyalgia.\r"

Further relaxation of the criterion to r greater than or equal to 0.80 reduced the 'failure' rate for unpleasantness descriptors to 24%. These data compare favourably with other published results from non-chronic and chronic pain patients. The provision of a fixed reference value produced range effects in the resulting scale but do not severely attenuate the range of the scale as has been previously suggested.

We recorded the force of isometric hind limb flexion withdrawal, and related flexor electromyographic (EMG) activity, elicited by noxious heat (42-54 degrees C, 10 sec) applied to the ventral hind paw. Several hind limb flexors including biceps femoris were active during the reflex. Quantified reflex responses to identical noxious heat stimuli delivered every 2 min were constant in magnitude and were reduced or abolished during stimulation (100 msec trains at 100 Hz, 3/sec, 15-325 microA) in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) or lateral reticular formation (LRF). LRF was significantly more effective than PAG stimulation in suppressing reflex responses. The magnitude of the reflex responses increased with graded increases in the temperature of the noxious heat stimulus. The slope of the temperature-response relationship was significantly reduced during PAG stimulation, whereas it was shifted toward higher temperatures with significantly increased threshold during LRF stimulation. To investigate possible transmitters involved, we tested if PAG- or LRF-evoked reflex suppression was affected following systemic administration of the opiate antagonist naloxone, the serotonin antagonist methysergide, the noradrenergic antagonist phentolamine, or the cholinergic antagonist scopolamine. Naloxone had little effect, while methysergide and phentolamine reduced PAG- and LRF-evoked reflex suppression in about one-half of the cases. Scopolamine largely reduced PAG- and LRF-evoked reflex suppression (in 8/9 and 4/6 rats, respectively). These results indicate that the flexion reflex is under parametrically but not pharmacologically distinct inhibitory midbrain controls.\r"

STT units were identified by their antidromic response to stimulation in the contralateral ventrobasal thalamus or medial lemniscus (mean conduction velocity: 18-20 m/sec). Thirty-two of 43 dorsal horn multireceptive STT units gave reproducible responses to noxious heat stimuli (42-56 degrees C, 10 sec) applied to the ventral hind paw. All STT units' responses were suppressed during stimulation (100 msec trains at 100 Hz, 3/sec, 15-300 microA) in PAG or LRF bilaterally. On- and offset of inhibition was rapid (less than 1 sec). STT unit responses to noxious heat were more effectively suppressed by LRF than PAG stimulation, based on statistically significant differences in mean thresholds for inhibition, slopes of current-inhibition plots, and mean current intensities evoking 50% inhibition. Mapping experiments revealed lowest-threshold (less than 25 microA) sites for inhibition to be in ventral PAG, subjacent tegmentum, and LRF bilaterally. STT unit responses increased with graded increases in stimulus temperature from threshold (mean: 46 degrees C) to 56 degrees C. Slopes of temperature-response functions were significantly reduced with little change in threshold during PAG stimulation, whereas these functions were shifted in a parallel manner toward higher temperatures during LRF stimulation. The serotonin antagonist methysergide reduced or blocked PAG- or LRF-evoked inhibition in 3/5 and 5/12 STT units, respectively. These results indicate that STT units are subject to different inhibitory controls from PAG and LRF.\r"

The lesion reduced the mean tail-flick latency by approximately 35% and increased the mean tail skin temperature by approximately 3.5 degrees C; both parameters gradually returned to normal values within 2-3 weeks. Both in controls and in lesioned animals there was a highly significant negative correlation between tail skin temperature and tail-flick latency. Multiple regression analysis showed that the effect of lesioning on tail-flick latency was non-significant when the effect of skin temperature was taken into account. Thus the reduced tail-flick latency after lesions of descending serotonergic pathways, usually interpreted as increased nociception, may be due to changes in tail skin temperature.\r"

Levorphanol infusions yielded tolerance to both morphine and levorphanol while morphine infusions selectively produced tolerance to morphine. This unidirectional tolerance might be due to the selectivity of morphine for mu receptors compared to levorphanol's ability to interact more potently with other relevant receptor subtypes. These observations raise the possibility that the order in which different opioid analgesics are administered may be of clinical significance.\r"

The results were also compared with placebo procedures and it was shown that the model could accurately quantify the parameters that determine the pain response following cold-induced intradental nerve impulse activity (INA). The most effective pain relieving method was found to be partial nerve block which induced significant parameter alterations reflecting decreased pain sensation and increased reaction time. Thus, it was shown that the present mathematical model is a useful tool enabling detailed analysis of differences in pain relieving procedures on human pulpal pain mediated by nerves of the A type.\r"

Of 74 staphylococcal isolates, 61 strains were found to produce ET by the newborn mouse assay method and the latex agglutination method. Fifteen strains were positive for ET-A, 32 for ET-B and 14 for both ET-A and ET-B. Among 61 ET-producing strains 27 (44%) were classified as Phage Group II, 16 (26%) as Group III, and 14 (23%) as Groups I and III. Of 27 Phage Group II strains 14 produced ET-A and 13 produced both ET-A and ET-B, but no strain was positive solely for ET-B. On the other hand 15 of 16 Phage Group III strains and all 14 Phage Group I and III strains produced only ET-B. It was demonstrated that the phage types of staphylococci were closely related to ET types. Characteristically the minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin G against ET-producing strains were less than 2 micrograms/ml, in contrast to other pathogenic staphylococci, 60 to 70% of which are highly penicillin G-resistant.\r"

There were 330 children at the UH and 340 at the RHC; 319 and 315 age matched nondiarrheal children served as controls for the respective groups. Rotavirus was detected in 15.2% of 330 cases and 1.9% of 319 controls at the UH (P less than 0.001) and in 16.5% of 340 cases and 2.9% of 315 controls at the RHC (P less than 0.001). RV excretion was 3- to 5-fold more common in severe compared with mild diarrhea at the UH and at the RHC (P less than 0.001). The detection rate for enteric-type adenoviruses was similar in patients and controls, respectively, at the UH (0.9%; 2.5%) and RHC (3.8%; 2.5%). At the RHC adenovirus types other than 40 and 41 were excreted by 8.8% of the patients and by only 1.0% of the controls (P less than 0.001). It is possible that the diarrheagenic role of adenoviruses may not be restricted to types 40 and 41.\r"

There were 125 episodes in 27 patients. Pneumonia (24 of 125 (19%)), upper respiratory tract syndromes (23 of 125 (19%)), urinary tract infection (24 of 125 (19%)) and wound infection (12 of 125 (10%)) were the most common syndromes identified. Bacteremic infections occurred in 35 of 125 (28%), and in 17 of 125 (14%) no other primary source could be identified. Pneumococci (11 of 35 (31%)) and Salmonella (4 of 35 (11%)) were the most common blood isolates; however, a wide spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens were recovered. Bacterial pneumonia directly contributed to the death of 4 patients, in whom pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii (2), cytomegalovirus (1) or varicella-zoster virus (1) also coexisted, respectively. Absolute T4 counts less than 400 and depressed lymphocyte-proliferative responses to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, Candida antigen and pokeweed mitogen correlated with the occurrence of bacterial infection in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children. Although bacterial infections are a frequent cause of morbidity in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children, they are usually treatable.\r"

The scans appeared normal for 73 children. Of these children, 30 had severe head injuries and a depressed sensorium. A total of 27 abdominal/pelvic CT scans were interpreted as abnormal. Findings included nine splenic fractures, six renal contusions, nine hepatic lacerations, one duodenal hematoma, one traumatic pancreatitis, four bony injuries, six miscellaneous abnormalities, and one intraperitoneal bleed. Only two of these 27 patients required abdominal surgery. The remaining 25 patients were treated conservatively based upon a stable clinical state and CT delineation of the extent of injury. No mortality resulted. CT is the radiographic examination of choice for hemodynamically stable pediatric patients with blunt abdominal trauma. CT provided a reliable adjunct examination technique when a physical examination could not be performed and a complete history could not be obtained. The extent of abdominal/pelvic injuries is well delineated and can often be followed by diagnostic imaging, usually allowing for conservative therapy.\r"

Among 3,026 neonatal intensive care unit admissions, 0.2% were prompted by adverse drug reactions; among 725 children with cancer, 22% of admissions were prompted by adverse drug reactions. Among 6,546 children with other conditions monitored on general medical and specialty wards at two teaching hospitals and on general pediatric wards at three community hospitals, 2% (131) of admissions were prompted by adverse drug reactions. Two patients (0.03%) died because of their reactions. The proportion of admissions prompted by drug reactions increased between infancy and 5 years of age and tended to be relatively stable thereafter. The drugs most commonly implicated in the admissions were phenobarbital, aspirin, phenytoin, ampicillin/amoxicillin, theophylline/aminophylline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine. Similar proportions of admissions were prompted by adverse drug reactions in teaching hospitals (2.1%) and in community hospitals (1.8%), and the drug groups implicated in these admissions were generally similar in the two settings. In contrast to adult populations, children with adverse drug reactions account for a small proportion of hospital admissions. Findings from this large, systematic study of pediatric admissions to teaching and community hospitals may serve as a baseline to which other pediatric facilities can compare their experience.\r"

All infants were born to families living in low socioeconomic urban neighborhoods. Pneumootoscopy was used to determine the presence or absence of middle ear effusion during periodic medical and nonmedical visits throughout a 1-year period. Of all infants studied, 91% had at least one episode of otitis media with effusion during the observation interval. There were no differences in the percentages of visits during which high-risk and full-term infants experienced either normal middle ears bilaterally or otitis media with effusion in one or both ears. Furthermore, the age of onset of otitis media with effusion was similar for the two groups of babies. No differences were found between boys and girls in the age of onset for otitis media or in the percentage of visits at which otitis media with effusion was detected. Hispanic infants experienced their initial episode at significantly younger ages than did black infants in the sample. Both groups had similar percentages of visits attributable to otitis media with effusion during the observation period. The results indicate a high incidence among the infants studied and similar otologic courses for neonatal intensive care unit graduates and full-term infants during the first year of life.\r"

Frequent episodes of clinically unsuspected arterial oxygen desaturation have recently been described in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We hypothesized that infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who experience frequent episodes of hypoxia may have abnormal arousal responses to these hypoxic episodes. We studied 12 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 41.4 +/- 1.3 weeks postconceptional age. Hypoxic arousal responses were performed during quiet sleep at an inspired oxygen tension of 80 mm Hg for a maximum of three minutes or until arousal occurred. Of 12 infants, 11 (92%) aroused normally to the hypoxic challenge. However, all infants required vigorous stimulation and supplemental oxygen after the initial arousal response. Of 12 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, eight (67%) experienced prolonged apnea with bradycardia, and four of 12 (33%) required brief ventilatory assistance (bag and mask) to restore normal breathing. Abnormal pneumographic findings did not predict the occurrence of these prolonged periods of apnea and bradycardia following hypoxia. We conclude that an abnormal response to hypoxia following arousal may lead to prolonged apnea and bradycardia in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We speculate that the inability to recover from this hypoxia may result in sudden death in these infants.\r"

Excess breath H2 excretion was found in virtually all study subjects following the ingestion of either pear juice (with approximately 2% sorbitol content) or the 2% sorbitol solution, in approximately 50% of those ingesting apple juice (0.5% sorbitol), and in 25% of those ingesting grape juice (no sorbitol) (P less than .001, analysis of variance). No differences were noted between the healthy children and those with chronic nonspecific diarrhea. Forty percent of all study subjects in whom excess breath hydrogen excretion occurred also had diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Carbohydrate malabsorption appears to be frequent following the ingestion of common fruit juices and in some children may be associated with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms.\r"

Results of lung and skin biopsies showed vasculitis with intense eosinophil infiltration. Immunofluorescence analyses of these biopsies, as well as analysis of tissue from the parotid, lip, and trachea, showed striking deposition of eosinophil granule major basic protein associated with areas of tissue damage. Treatment with glucocorticoids and hydroxyurea produced clinical improvement. The association between tissue damage and deposition of the cytotoxic major basic protein suggests that the eosinophil contributed to the pathophysiology of this disease. Recognition of the capacity of the eosinophil to produce tissue damage can be helpful in the selection of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between congenital malformations and intrauterine growth retardation was investigated using data from the population-based Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program. Between 1970 and 1984, the system ascertained 13,074 infants with major structural malformations diagnosed in the first year of life and born to metropolitan Atlanta residents. These infants were classified as having intrauterine growth retardation if their birth weight was below the race-, sex-, and gestational age-specific tenth percentile limits for all Atlanta births. Overall, the frequency of intrauterine growth retardation among malformed infants was 22.3% (relative risk 2.6). Of 48 defect categories evaluated, 46 were associated with excess intrauterine growth retardation, most notably chromosomal anomalies (eg, 83.7% for infants with trisomy 18, relative risk 46) and anencephaly (73.3%, relative risk 25). Only a few isolated defects (such as isolated polydactyly, pyloric stenosis, and congenital hip dislocation) were not associated with excess intrauterine growth retardation. Among infants with multiple malformations, the frequency of intrauterine growth retardation increased markedly with increasing number of defects--from 20% for infants with two defects to 60% for infants with nine or more defects. The relationship between malformations and intrauterine growth retardation can be explained by one or more of three mechanisms: (1) intrauterine growth retardation can be a secondary disturbance to the presence of malformations; (2) intrauterine growth retardation can predispose the fetus to malformations; and (3) intrauterine growth retardation can coexist with malformations because of common etiologic factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Symptoms, physical findings, chest x-ray, and fluoroscopy were compared with different sites of enlodgement. Positive history was obtained in 135 (91%). In 133 children, the diagnosis was made on admission. Frequent symptoms were cough (80%) and cyanosis (27%) following aspiration, while prevalent emergency department symptoms were cough (33%) and dyspnea (30%). Common physical findings on admission were decreased breath sounds (65%), tachypnea (43%), and fever (36%). Admission chest radiographs revealed emphysema (43%) and infiltrates or atelectasis (29%). Forty-one children (27%) were asymptomatic, and 43 children had normal chest x-ray. Fluoroscopy showed inspiratory mediastinal shift in 57%. Bronchoscopy performed within 48 hours of admission was successful in removing the foreign material in 88% of the children. Food particles were the most common type of foreign body. Hoarseness and stridor were significantly more common in upper airway enlodgement (P less than 0.01). Decreased breath sounds were significantly more common among children with lower airway enlodgement (P less than 0.001). A delay in diagnosis of longer than three weeks was associated with equivocal history of aspiration (P less than 0.05), and with significantly more wheezing (P less than 0.02) and atelectasis (P less than 0.01). Our study reemphasizes the importance of integrating various diagnostic tools in order to accurately evaluate and manage these children.\r"

For participants with local providers, major reasons for use of the emergency department included economic factors, parental knowledge, parent/provider communication, convenience, and insurance coverage. The results of this study demonstrate that the utilization pattern and sociodemographic profile of children seen in our emergency department on weekdays is more characteristic of an inner-city hospital than of a non-metropolitan setting. There are a number of feasible measures which could improve access to routine pediatric care for low socioeconomic families and reduce unnecessary emergency department utilization.\r"

  ".W": "Many children who roller skate sustain injuries. To determine the type and severity of these mishaps, the medical records of 76 children less than 16 years of age with roller skating injuries presenting to two pediatric emergency departments were reviewed. Seventy-five percent were girls, and 25% were boys. The upper extremity was the most common body part injured (74%) (P less than 0.0001). Lower extremity injuries occurred in 12%, head and face injuries in 10%, and chest injuries in 4%. The most common type of injury was a fracture (69%), with the wrist and forearm being most frequently fractured (53%). Hospitalization and long-term sequelae were infrequent. Younger children (less than or equal to 9) had an increased frequency of fracture injury (P less than 0.02). This is most likely because maturation of lower and upper extremity speed, strength, agility, coordination, balance, and reaction time and morphologically stronger bones combine to afford relative protection to the older child. Physicians and parents need to be aware of a child's skill level before the child is encouraged to roller skate. Measures which may decrease the likelihood of injury include protective gear, instruction in roller skating technique, learning to skate in an uncongested area on level, familiar terrain, and learning to fall properly.\r"

The overall agreement factor R = 0.052 for 7699 reflections, 20 theta max = 150 degrees, Cu K-alpha radiation. The structure determination revealed that didemnin B contains an isostatine residue instead of a statine residue. The conformation of the 23-membered depsipeptide ring is stabilized by one transannular hydrogen bond. The ring does not show the antiparallel beta-pleated-sheet structure but, instead, has a fold in the shape of a bent figure-eight. The linear peptide moiety, containing N-methylleucine and lactylproline, forms a beta (II)-bend and is folded back toward the cyclic backbone, giving the overall molecule a globular character. Comparison with the structure of cyclosporin A shows distinct stereochemical differences between the two molecules. It is suggested that didemnin B and cyclosporin A are unlikely to have a common receptor binding site.\r"

Most histone mRNAs are not polyadenylylated but rather terminate in a highly conserved stem and loop structure. The early, late, and testis-specific histone genes of sea urchins, described to date, have this typical histone gene structure. We have identified an unusual H1 gene, H1-delta, in sea urchins that encodes a poly(A)+ mRNA. This mRNA is one of a group of polyadenylylated transcripts homologous with H1 gene probes. The sequence of H1-delta had been determined. H1-delta encodes a different H1 protein. Although the temporal expression of H1-delta mRNA is similar to that of other late H1 (beta and gamma) mRNAs, its spatial distribution at the time of maximal accumulation is distinct and confirms that H1-delta is regulated differently than other H1 genes.\r"

  ".U": "88247976\r", 
  ".W": "2,3,7,8,-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) administered in vivo causes drastic reduction in the weight of the mouse thymus at low doses (e.g., 30 micrograms/kg single i.p. injection), the reduction becoming statistically significant after 2 days. To understand the cause for such thymic involution TCDD-evoked changes in various biochemical parameters in this tissue were examined. The most noticeable change was observed in the increased activity of specific protein-tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C and an increased level of p21ras-associated binding of [3H]GTP. Since no significant change was observed with cAMP-stimulated protein kinases and cAMP levels, the above changes appear to be a selective effect on these special classes of proteins. As a result of a time sequence study it has become apparent that the rise in protein-tyrosine kinase activities becomes significant within 24 hr, whereas the rise in protein kinase C does not become significant until 48 hr. Among protein-tyrosine kinases, pp60c-src and probably pp561skT were found to be significantly elevated by TCDD treatment. In view of similarities between TCDD and thyroid hormones in causing thymic involution, the levels of c-erb-A expression were assessed in the liver by using avian 32P-labeled v-erb-A probe and RNA transfer blot hybridization technique. The results clearly indicate that TCDD has the property to elevate levels of mRNA bearing homology to v-erb-A. Such changes in c-erb-A expression and protein-tyrosine kinase occurred only in TCDD-susceptible (responsive) strains but not in tolerant (nonresponsive) strains of mice at the dose tested. Based on such observations a hypothesis has been proposed that TCDD owes its potency to its ability to stimulate the expression of one of a family of DNAs bearing homology to v-erb-A and that one of the major consequences of such an action is stimulation of various tyrosine kinases.\r"

  ".W": "We used gel electrophoresis methods to show that reaction of DNA with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) results in a substantial (approximately equal to 40 degrees) bend in the double helix at the intrastrand crosslink between the N7 atoms of adjacent guanosine nucleosides, which bond to the platinum(II) complex with loss of two chloride ions. Multimers of a 22-base-pair (bp) oligonucleotide platinated at a single site show strong anomalies in their electrophoretic mobilities as a consequence of coherent addition of in-phase platinum-induced bends. Increase of the sequence repeat of the platinated site to 27 bp yields multimers of nearly normal mobility because the bends are out of phase. The direction of Pt-induced bends relative to adenosine-tract bends was determined from the electrophoretic mobility of multimers in which repeated platination sites are interdigitated at various phasings relative to repeated adenosine tracts. Optimum bending occurs when 1.5 helical turns separate the cis-[Pt(NH3)2[d(pGpG)]](N7,N7) adducts from the center of the adenosine tracts. This phasing produces coherent addition of adenosine tract bends toward the minor groove at their centers and Pt-induced bends toward the major groove, where the platinum is located.\r"

The core components of this RNA polymerase are associated with a polypeptide that has an apparent mass of 35 kDa. Neither RNA polymerase holoenzyme isolated from vegetative B. thuringiensis, nor the core derived from this enzyme, is capable of transcribing from the crystal protein gene promoter region; the addition of gel-purified 35-kDa polypeptide to the core reconstitutes the specific transcribing capability. The reconstituted enzyme does not direct transcription from the promoters for the ctc or spoVG genes of Bacillus subtilis; however, this form of RNA polymerase does direct transcription from a promoter for the 27-kDa crystal protein of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis and from a promoter for a 29-kDa polypeptide present in cuboidal crystals of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD-1. We propose a tentative consensus sequence based on the alignment of the three B. thuringiensis promoters.

The amino group of carbamoyl phosphate donates hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyls of residues Pro-266 and Leu-267 and the side-chain carbonyl of Gln-137.

Three of eight cDNA clones that were sequenced predicted a precursor with 344 amino acids, whereas the remaining five cDNA clones encoded a 317 amino acid precursor, resulting from alternative splicing of the precursor mRNA. Mature follistatins contain four contiguous domains that are encoded by precisely separated exons; three of the domains are highly similar to each other, as well as to human epidermal growth factor and human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor. The genomic organization of the human follistatin is similar to that of the human epidermal growth factor gene and thus supports the notion of exon shuffling during evolution.\r"

Using the nitrocellulose-filtration method, concentration-dependent, apparently saturable binding was seen that is both specific and cAMP dependent. Analysis of various fragments pinpointed the active binding region to positions within the -67 to -111 region, which coincides with the functional regulatory element as shown by recent transfection studies. Formation of an apparently single complex between a synthetic oligomer containing the region from -67 to -111 of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene and a factor in nuclear extracts from cAMP-treated rat liver was visualized by the gel-retardation method. Complex formation is both concentration and cAMP dependent and can be prevented by excess specific but not nonspecific competitor DNA. The congruity of the results with the two different methods suggests that the factor we have detected has properties consistent with a possible role as mediator of the transcriptional control exerted by cAMP in eukaryotic cells.\r"

  ".W": "p56lck, a cellular tyrosine protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.112) of the src family, is expressed in essentially all T cells and in some B cells. Expression in nonlymphoid cells is observed only rarely. We have found that mutation of a carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation site, tyrosine-505, reveals an oncogenic activity of this protein. Infection of fibroblasts with a retrovirus encoding wild-type p56lck is without consequence. In contrast, infection with a virus encoding the mutant protein leads to greatly increased phosphorylation of cellular proteins on tyrosine, morphological transformation, and anchorage-independent growth. This suggests that the tyrosine protein kinase activity and the oncogenic potential of p56lck are normally suppressed in vivo by phosphorylation of tyrosine-505. Since similar results were obtained previously with an analogous mutant of c-src, our results suggest that the protein kinase activity of all members of the src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine protein kinases will prove to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation at a conserved residue near the carboxyl terminus. Because p56lck is normally expressed only in lymphoid cells, it was possible that p56lck would be without effect in other tissues. The transformation of fibroblasts by mutant p56lck shows that this lymphoid protein can interact productively with nonlymphoid polypeptide substrates.\r"

Although the avian viral transcripts are inactive in vivo, RNA extracted from infected, nonpermissive L cells directs the synthesis of a normal spectrum of viral proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysates.

The activation barrier for the proton exchange between the pteridine ring and the Asp-27 is calculated to be 20.1 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J) by using the coordinate-coupled perturbation method, implying that this may be a channel to the proton exchange from the pteridine ring to the solvent.

Consideration of the rationalized activity coefficient as a linear scaler in an expression for surface pressure as a function of depth in the surface phase permits comparison of surface pressure-area data for monolayers with force-distance data for bilayers. This analysis shows the thermodynamic equivalence of monolayers at collapse and fully hydrated bilayers. It also supports the interpretation of the activity coefficient as a scaler and allows its determination solely from bilayer-derived data. Overall, the results show the common assumption that partial specific volume of water equals its bulk value to be inappropriate for the analysis of surface structure.\r"

  ".U": "88248008\r", 
  ".W": "The purified 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor from skeletal muscle has been incorporated into planar bilayers, and its channel characteristics have been investigated. Conductances showed the characteristics of an L-type Ca2+ channel: divalent cation selectivity (PBa/PNa approximately equal to 30), blockage of Na+ conductance by micromolar Ca2+, and blockage of the Ca2+ channel by D890 and by Cd2+. The alpha 1 subunit of the receptor must be phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase to give channel activity. BAY K 8644 did not activate nonphosphorylated channels, and (+)-PN200-110 caused dramatic prolongation of mean open times when applied after phosphorylation. Channel properties were found to be dependent on association of receptor molecules in the bilayer. Single receptor molecules form channels of 0.9 pS (100 mM Ba2+) and show no voltage-dependent gating. Upon association, both voltage-dependent gating and higher conductance events are recovered; stabilized conductance levels assume values of even multiples of 0.9 pS, predominately 7.5 and 15 pS and multiples of these values up to 60 pS. Thus, individual channels become functionally coupled (synchronous opening and closing) with association, reinstating the characteristics of one larger unitary channel. It is concluded that the L-type Ca2+ channel represents an oligomer of 1,4-dihydropyridine-receptor protein complexes, each of which constitutes a channel, where the array of channels (oligochannel) opens and closes in concerted action.\r"

Conformational energy computations have been carried out on four types of four-alpha-helix bundles, each consisting of four CH3CO-(L-Ala)10-NHCH3 polypeptide chains, with various combinations of parallel and antiparallel orientations of the helices. In the bundle with the most favorable energy, all pairs of neighboring helices are oriented antiparallel--i.e., in the orientation that is favored by electrostatic interactions between the helices. In this structure, the orientation angle between neighboring helix axes is -168 degrees, within +/- 7 degrees, in close agreement with the orientation angles observed in proteins and with the value that we computed earlier for the most favorable packing of pairs of interacting alpha-helices. This orientation corresponds to a left-handed twisting of the helical bundle. The preferred handedness of this twisting arises as a result of favorable nonbonded interactions between the alpha-helices.\r"

In both species of yeast we have identified a single major RNA species in the size range of SRP RNA (256 nucleotides in S. pombe and 270 nucleotides in Y. lipolytica) present in postribosomal salt extracts of the cytoplasm. The RNPs containing these RNAs sediment in sucrose gradients at 11 S and 10 S for S. pombe and Y. lipolytica, respectively. Analysis of genomic clones of these RNAs has revealed that (i) they are encoded by single copy genes; (ii) they share two short conserved sequences that match the A and B boxes defined for polymerase III promoters; (iii) they can be folded into secondary structures that closely match that defined by phylogenetic analysis of higher eukaryotic SRP RNAs; and (iv) they show primary sequence conservation in short regions predicted to be single stranded. Both of the yeast RNAs bind under stringent conditions to canine SRP proteins. Most importantly, RNase protection of the S. pombe RNA by the individual canine SRP proteins, p19 and p68/72, shows that the proteins recognize homologous elements of the mammalian and yeast RNA. Taken together these data suggest strongly that we have identified yeast SRP homologues.\r"

It acted within minutes, its action was completely reversed by a single wash, and it appeared specific to the BFU-E. The activity-causing substance, being macromolecular, heat stable, and trypsin-sensitive, was evidently a protein and was named negative regulatory protein. We purified a negative regulatory protein from a bone marrow-derived \"B6 Pan\" cell line with properties thus far indistinguishable from those of the negative regulatory protein obtained directly from B6 marrow. By gel filtration the protein has a Mr of approximately equal to 79,000, by cation- and anion-exchange chromatography it appears to be a neutral molecule at physiological pH, and the molecule does not bind to Con A. After five sequential chromatographic steps, we obtained a preparation active at a concentration of 25 ng/ml. Our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that quiescence of BFU-E with respect to DNA synthesis in vivo in B6 mice is mediated by negative regulatory protein molecules.\r"

Heterotypic A-B and C-B complexes are unusually stable and involve the common amino-terminal domain of lamins A and C, but not their helical \"rod\" domain. A synthetic peptide, comprising the first 32 amino acid residues of lamins A and C, is able to fully compete with the intact molecules for binding to lamin B. Conversely, heterotypic A-C associations and homotypic A-A and C-C interactions appear significantly weaker than A/C-B binding and do not involve the lamin A and C amino-terminal domain. Homotypic B-B complexes are not formed to any considerable extent unless isolated lamin B subunits are \"superphosphorylated\" in vitro with protein kinase A. However, when lamins A and C are similarly modified, no changes in their binding specificity can be detected. These data suggest that the nuclear lamina, unlike other multicomponent intermediate filaments, constitutes a nonobligatory heteropolymer. They also indicate that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of interphase lamin B could cause remodeling of the lamina and establishment of homopolymeric domains.\r"

The mutant line, genotype LDLD, cannot synthesize UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine under normal culture conditions and, therefore, cannot add mucin-type O-linked oligosaccharides to proteins. The UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine pools in LDLD cells can be filled rapidly when N-acetylgalactosamine is added to the culture medium, thus restoring normal synthesis of O-linked carbohydrates. Pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiments were used to show that (i) the first step in the O-glycosylation of LDL receptors can occur posttranslationally; (ii) after O-linked sugar-deficient LDL receptors reach the cell surface, they are not subject to subsequent O-linked sugar addition, suggesting that they do not return to compartments in which O-glycosylation takes place; (iii) O-linked carbohydrate chains on the LDL receptor itself are required for normal stability and function; and (iv) the instability of the O-linked sugar-deficient LDL receptor is due to proteolytic cleavage and the release into the medium of the bulk of the NH2-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor. It appears that O-glycosylation of the LDL receptor and several other cell surface glycoproteins permits stable cell-surface expression by preventing proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domains of these proteins.\r"

In situ hybridization experiments revealed that the increased expression of the mdr mRNA is specifically localized to the secretory epithelial cells of the endometrium. Immunocytochemistry studies with a mdr glycoprotein-specific antiserum demonstrate that the mdr glycoprotein is predominantly localized to the luminal surface of the secretory epithelial cells. These results indicate that the mdr gene expression in the uterus is controlled by the physiologic changes associated with pregnancy. Our data are consistent with a potential role for the mdr glycoprotein in the transport of substrate across the secretory epithelium of the gravid uterus.\r"

We have quantitated the production of one type of oxidative DNA damage, thymine glycols, by using a monoclonal antibody specific to this base modification. Thymine glycols were produced in DNA in a dose-dependent manner after exposure of human mammary epithelial cells to benzo[a]pyrene. The number of thymine glycols formed in the DNA was similar to that of 7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene covalently bound to the DNA. Exposure of cells to the carcinogen in the presence of superoxide dismutase, which reduces superoxide anions, inhibited the production of thymine glycols and increased cell survival but had little effect on adduct formation. At equitoxic doses, approximately equal to 10-fold more thymine glycols were formed after exposure to benzo[a]pyrene than to gamma-irradiation. Thymine glycols, produced by either agent, were efficiently removed from the DNA of the cells. Since thymine glycols represent only a portion of the oxidative damage possibly produced, our results indicate that the total amount of oxidative damage induced during the exposure of human mammary epithelial cells to benzo[a]pyrene greatly exceeds the amount produced by direct adduct formation and that this indirect damage plays an important role in the cytotoxicity of benzo[a]pyrene.\r"

  ".W": "Modern coding sequences are in the periodicto-chaotic transition. In the case of two related sequences for lens alpha A-crystallin and small heat shock protein, the original repeating units were heptameric in length. Accordingly, base trimers that were parts of heptameric units recurred far more frequently than those that were not included. In the crystallin coding sequence, CTG trimer recurred 21 times, and TCT and TCC trimers recurred 17 times each. By contrast, CTA and TCG, although related to the above, recurred only 4 and 3 times, respectively. It is a small wonder that 10 of the 16 leucine residues were encoded by CTG, whereas none was encoded by CTA, and that 17 of the 23 serine residues were encoded either by TCT or by TCC, whereas only 1 was encoded by TCG. In the small heat shock protein coding sequence, however, AGC became parts of the two prominent heptameric recurring units. Not surprisingly, 10 of the 22 serine residues were now encoded by AGC. In conclusion, the so-called codon preference is a mere reflection of the construction principle of coding sequences and has very little to do with selection per se.\r"

We demonstrate here that the guanine-rich homopurine stretches located at the right end of L-DNA induce oligonucleotide uptake by contiguous duplex DNA. The uptake is dependent on negative supercoiling and the length of the homopurine stretch and occurs even when the L-DNA homopurine stretches are introduced into a different DNA environment. The bound oligomer primes DNA synthesis when DNA polymerase and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates are added, resulting in a faithful copy of the template to which the oligonucleotide had bound. The implications of this property of the L-DNA guanine-rich homopurine stretches in the amplification, recombination, and dispersal of L elements is discussed.\r"

These regions are separated by a variable segment containing the repeated sequences (ATTTT)n and (AT)xTy, which might be involved in recombinational events. Studies of haplotypes linked to the sickle cell gene in Africa provide strong argument for three origins of the mutation: Benin, Senegal, and the Central African Republic. Nevertheless, the haplotype determination does not give any information about the variable segment and does not totally exclude the possibility of recombination leading to different haplotypes linked to the mutation. The structure of the variable segment in the three African populations was studied by S1 nuclease mapping of genomic DNA, which allows a comparison of several samples. A 1080-base-pair DNA segment was sequenced for one sample from each population. S1 nuclease mapping confirmed the homogeneity of each population with regard to both (ATTTT)n and (AT)xTy repeats. We found three additional structures for (AT)xTy correlating with the geographic origin of the patients. Ten other nucleotide positions, 5' and 3' to the (AT)xTy copies, were found to be variable when compared to homologous sequences from human and monkey DNAs. These results allow us to propose an evolutionary scheme for the polymorphisms in the 5' flanking region of the beta-globin gene. The results strongly support the hypothesis of three origins for the sickle mutation in Africa.\r"

The percentage of wells containing detectable antibodies in initial screening ranged from 1 to 17%, but the vast majority of the cultures lost antibody activity on subsequent expansion. Two antibody-secreting clones, J309 and D579, derived from separate individuals and reactive with anaplastic lung cancer cell lines, were successfully expanded and fused with the NS-1 mouse myeloma cell line. The antibodies produced by these clones exhibited identical restricted serologic reactivity against cultured cell lines and detected a carbohydrate antigen present in the neutral glycolipid fraction of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Serologic, immunochemical, and chemical analyses revealed that the antigen recognized by antibodies J309 and D579 is galactosylgloboside [Gal(beta 1----3)GalNAc(beta 1----3)Gal(alpha 1----4)Gal(beta 1----4)- GlcCer]. Conclusions regarding the significance of these findings with respect to the biology of lung cancer await further information concerning the distribution of galactosylgloboside in normal and malignant tissues and the frequency of antibodies to this structure in normal and tumor-bearing individuals.\r"

Unlike the parental cells, transfected cells are potent inducers of H-2Kb-restricted syngeneic cytotoxic lymphocytes that kill the Kb-positive clones and cross-react with parental nontransfected cells. Preimmunization of mice with Kb-positive transfectants conferred protection against metastatic spread of malignant cells. Moreover, immunotherapy of metastasis was achieved by immunization with the H-2Kb-transfected cells of animals already carrying a growing local tumor of the parental cells.\r"

Most of these inclusions are made of abnormal filaments and share epitopes with cytoskeletal proteins. One of these inclusions, the neurofibrillary tangle of Alzheimer disease, has recently been shown to contain ubiquitin, a regulatory protein thought to play a role in the degradation of abnormal proteins. We carried out light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with several polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to investigate the presence of ubiquitin in neuronal inclusions of neurodegenerative diseases. Ubiquitin was present not only in paired helical filaments that form the neurofibrillary tangle of Alzheimer disease, but also in the filamentous components of the inclusion characteristic of Parkinson disease, Pick disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy. In contrast, ubiquitin was not detected in other neuronal inclusions often found in aging and in Alzheimer disease, such as Hirano bodies and granulovacuolar degeneration. Reactivity with monoclonal antibodies suggests differences in the ubiquitin-acceptor proteins present in the inclusions studied. It is concluded that ubiquitin is selectively present in neuronal inclusions of degenerative diseases.\r"

In addition, hemagglutination by coronaviruses can be inhibited by pretreatment of erythrocytes with Arthrobacter ureafaciens or Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase or by addition of sialic acid-containing gangliosides.

Monoclonal antibodies directed against the Thy-1.1 molecule or a neuronal surface ganglioside (A2B5) had no effect on this calcium current in Thy-1.2-bearing cells, nor did they interfere with subsequent activation by the anti-Thy-1.2 monoclonal antibody.

The voltage sensitivity is not a constant property of the exchange, as it is reduced by an increase in external Na+ or by the removal of external Ca2+, Mg2+, or K+. Changes in membrane potential do not appear to affect the affinity of the exchange mechanism for internal Ca2+, but hyperpolarization increases the affinity for external Na+. When the external Na+ concentration is raised sufficiently to saturate the exchange mechanism, the voltage sensitivity is no longer apparent. We propose that the voltage dependence of the exchange is due to the external Na+-binding site being sensitive to membrane potential, perhaps because it is located within the membrane electric field.\r"

When administered over the same treatment period, neither nonselective (phenoxybenzamine) nor selective [prazosin (alpha 1) and yohimbine (alpha 2)] alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists affected the onset or severity of joint injury. Metoprolol, a beta 1 antagonist, was also without effect. In contrast, two beta 2 antagonists (butoxamine and ICI 118,551) significantly retarded disease onset and reduced the severity of joint injury. When reserpine or butoxamine treatment was initiated after the onset of clinically apparent arthritis, it was still possible to favorably influence the course of the disease. These data indicate an important contribution of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor to joint injury in experimental arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "Precedent exists for the early development and subsequent down-regulation of neurotransmitter receptor systems in the vertebrate central nervous system, but the function of such embryonic receptors has not been established. Here we show that stimulation of early-developing dopamine receptors in avian retina cells greatly inhibits the motility of neuronal growth cones. Neurons from embryonic chicken retinas were cultured in low-density monolayers, and their growth cones were observed with phase-contrast or video-enhanced-contrast-differential-interference-contrast (VEC-DIC) microscopy. Approximately 25% of the neurons responded to micromolar dopamine with a rapid reduction in filopodial activity followed by a flattening of growth cones and retraction of neurites. The response occurred at all ages examined (embryonic day-8 retinal neurons cultured on polylysine-coated coverslips for 1-7 days), although neurite retraction was greatest in younger cultures. Effects of dopamine on growth cone function could be reversed by haloperidol or (+)-SCH 23390, whereas forskolin elicited a response similar to dopamine; these data show the response was receptor-mediated, acting through a D1-type system, and are consistent with the use of cAMP as a second messenger. The experiments provide strong support for the hypothesis that neurotransmitters, besides mediating transynaptic signaling in the adult, may have a role in neuronal differentiation as growth regulators.\r"

This has resulted in a proliferation of \"walk in\" and mobile mammography screening clinics and a barrage of publicity aimed at women aged 40 and over. Among these are more than a half million women who have had an augmentation mammaplasty; at least another half million are still under 40 but entering this age group incrementally. Opinion is divided as to the value of this procedure because of uncertainty as to the amount of breast tissue obscured by the implant. Calibrated planimetry was used to measure the area of the implant and the glandular portion of the breasts in six sets of mammograms. Utilizing solid geometric calculations, it was found that the percentage of glandular tissue obscured by the implant varied from 22 to 83 percent. This wide variation casts serious doubt on the reliability of routine film screen mammography in these patients.\r"

By detecting early drops in the SAO2 with the pulse oximeter, appropriate corrective measures could be instituted and titration of intravenous anesthetics adjusted, avoiding progression to more profound hypoxemia and thus resulting in the safer delivery of anesthesia. The pulse oximeter is a useful and recommended adjunct to the traditional methods of monitoring in an office-based ambulatory surgical facility.\r"

The results indicate that either of the enzymatic activities of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers was different between motor and sensory fascicles. Fifty-seven percent of the myelinated fibers showed enzymatic activity in the motor fascicles, while none of the myelinated fibers in the sensory fascicles showed enzymatic activity. The unmyelinated fibers showing enzymatic activity in the sensory fascicles were far denser than those in the motor fascicles. Our study demonstrated that the unmyelinated fibers were sympathetic postganglionic unmyelinated fibers. From these results it is concluded that the motor and sensory fascicles may be identified not only according to the enzymatic activities of the myelinated fibers, but also according to the enzymatic activities of the sympathetic postganglionic unmyelinated fibers. An improved histochemical method was suggested for its applicability as a method of intraoperative nerve fascicle identification. Simulated experiments were done on the radial nerves and the median nerves in human cadavers. This improved histochemical process can be completed within 50 minutes and can be used in intraoperative nerve fascicle identification.\r"

Nonvascularized and vascularized nerve grafts were created in opposite hindlimbs of each dog. The intravascular presence of India ink was not observed until the third day postoperatively in the nonvascularized grafts, while it was demonstrated in vascularized grafts on the first postoperative day. Control blood flow in undisturbed nerves ranged from 0.06 to 0.16 ml/min/gm dry weight. On postoperative day 1, flow was not detectable in any of the nonvascularized grafts, while vascularized grafts all had increased flow with a mean of 0.73 ml/min/gm dry weight. By day 3, two of six dogs had some measurable flow in the nonvascularized grafts, while flow in vascularized grafts had reached a mean of 1.88 ml/min/gm dry weight. By day 6, blood flow rate had increased to 7.63 and 4.72 ml/min/gm dry weight for nonvascularized and vascularized grafts, respectively. By this avoidance of up to 3 days of warm ischemia, there may be some advantage to vascularized nerve grafts even in a well-vascularized bed.\r"

A certain compensatory mechanism is possible mainly in the circular pattern and the circular pattern with Passavant's ridge and sagittal patterns. Passavant's ridge is an anatomic variant rather than a compensatory mechanism. The muscularis uvulae is important mainly in nonphonetic activities of the velopharyngeal valve. This information is important for clinical purposes in order to better correct problems associated with velopharyngeal incompetence.\r"

A 4 x 20 mm strip of cartilage is removed from the concha of the ear and placed in the lower lid, deep to the orbicularis muscle. Over the past 6 years, I have performed this procedure on 15 patients. Fourteen patients had an excellent result; one patient required a secondary lateral wedge resection. There have been no recurrences. The tarsal plate of the lower eyelid appears to soften and shrink with advancing age. As the tarsus shrinks, the lid becomes less rigid and the margin tends to roll inward. Creating a neotarsus out of ear cartilage provides a simple and stable repair for involutional entropion because it restores the structural rigidity of the lower lid. The operative procedure is technically simple. Its long-term effectiveness confirms the view, not widely held, that one primary cause of involutional entropion is a shrunken and atrophic tarsal plate.\r"

The nose is covered by a nasal SMAS, which forms part of the SMAS of the face. The continuous fibromuscular layer interconnects the musculature through aponeuroses, thus distributing their forces. The alar muscles change the transnasal pressure of the nasal valve, affecting respiration. To preserve the integrity of the nasal soft-tissue layers, one may elevate the soft-tissue envelope beneath the nasal musculature.\r"

Specific complications were observed with particularly high frequency within distinct anatomic sites. The highest incidence of complications occurred in the cheek and neck (69 percent) and forehead (50 percent) regions. Complications in the eyelid region (33 percent) and scalp (17 percent) were less common. Implant exposure was the most frequently observed complication.

  ".U": "88248344\r", 
  ".W": "Various traditional mammaplasty techniques have been suggested for unilateral breast reduction, and an inverted-T incision is still the most popular approach. However, unilaterally performed traditional techniques can rarely provide long-lasting symmetry because the operated and the unoperated breasts react differently to aging, weight changes, and pregnancy. Considerable residual scarring, interference with clinical and mammographic evaluation, and limited versatility are all major drawbacks of traditional procedures. We have performed unilateral mammaplasties on 47 patients with various types of congenital and acquired asymmetries, reducing and sculpturing the breast from the undersurface by means of minimal incisions, always avoiding horizontal scarring in the inframammary crease. Through a vertical infra-areolar incision, the breast is completely detached from the underlying pectoralis fascia and hooked up, thus completely exposing the undersurface of the mammary cone. The breast can thereafter be reshaped according to the size and shape of the contralateral breast by means of a discoid resection and/or selective sectoral removal of excessive subcutaneous tissues; modifications of the basic discoid resection can increase anterior projection of the new breast mound and can change the inclination of the anteroposterior breast axis on the anterior chest wall both on the horizontal and vertical planes. The results show that if criteria for patient selection are carefully respected, the procedure can provide long-lasting symmetry with minimal residual scarring and fully preserve the breast anatomy, function, and vascularization.\r"

These include additional projections, different pulse sequence, and 90 degree shift of phase-encoding gradient. The use of respiratory gating or cardiac gating may also improve image quality by reducing some of the motion-related artifacts.\r"

The service, begun in 1982, was managed by a senior radiologist and fellows. Because of increasing admissions (from a mean of 52 per year in 1982-1985 to 110 per year in 1985-1987), a 1/2-day, twice-weekly clinic was created in 1985 to evaluate new patients and perform follow-up examinations. In 1986 a physician's assistant was hired to assist in the clinic and during patient admissions. Use of the clinic and physician's assistant streamlined patient flow and management during hospitalization. This resulted in a decrease in mean length of stay for patients undergoing angioplasty (from 3.74 days in 1982-1983 to 2.41 days in 1986-1987). This decrease means cost savings for the hospital under the prospective payment system. Other benefits include improved physician-patient relationships and follow-up, new patients for colleagues (15% of patients had anatomy unsuitable for interventional procedures and were referred to staff surgeons), and increased professional fees.\r"

In all four, the deteriorating clinical findings prompted surgical intervention. In three patients, Fogarty balloon catheters easily passed the occluded segments and specimens much the same as surgical endarterectomy specimens were retrieved. A clamp was used to retrieve the dissected portion of the vessel wall in the fourth patient. Three of four vessels have remained patent for 18 months, 18 months, and 6 months, respectively. One patient underwent bypass surgery 4 months after the occlusion episode for recurrent stenosis in a segment of vessel above the occluded segment, which had also been dilated during the same procedure. It is therefore possible in some cases to salvage vessels occluded during angioplasty, making it unnecessary to resort to aortofemoral or other type of bypass.\r"

The authors studied 30 girls with STU using videourodynamics. Twenty-eight showed bladder instability; 21, a congenital wide bladder neck anomaly; and 20, both instability and a wide bladder neck. One patient had a sensitive bladder. All patients had a urodynamic abnormality. The authors believe that the STU is nearly always an indication of bladder instability or wide bladder neck anomaly. The most common mechanism for the dilatation of the posterior urethra is that unstable contractions are resisted by a voluntary increase in distal sphincter tension so as to prevent leakage of urine. The resulting pressure rise produces distention of the posterior urethra, which will be maximal in subjects with a weak bladder neck mechanism as in the congenital wide bladder neck anomaly. The authors believe that STU is seldom if ever a normal variant.\r"

In 14 postoperative patients, the location of the pulled-through intestine was examined in relation to the sphincter muscles.

MR imaging demonstrated more metastases in nine of these 26 patients. However, contrast material-enhanced CT scans were superior in lesion depiction in eight of the 26 patients. Large enhanced lesions that were nearly isointense on MR images were seen well on CT scans. In several cases in which results were discordant, gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-enhanced MR images were obtained, and this agent behaved similarly to iodinated contrast agents. If indicated clinically, such as before surgery for a single metastasis, the authors perform both MR imaging and contrast-enhanced CT. Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging may prove to be the method of choice for depiction of intraparenchymal metastases.\r"

Images from 20 patients demonstrated a thin band of abnormal signal contiguous with the primary lesion and conforming to the known anatomic pathway of a white matter tract. Cerebral infarction was the most common associated primary disorder (n = 17). Neoplasms (n = 2), demyelinating (n = 1) and posthemorrhagic (n = 2) conditions, and an idiopathic movement disorder (n = 1) were associated with white matter tract signal abnormalities that were indistinguishable from those seen with infarction. Signal abnormality corresponding to the corticospinal tract was the type most commonly seen. No change in signal characteristics was seen with time (six cases) or following contrast material administration (two cases).

All cases demonstrated on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images areas of hypointensity in the basal ganglia, thalami, and white matter that were attributed to iron deposition. Associated areas of hyperintensity were also seen in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, and these were attributed to gliosis. In one case calcium deposition was also present within the areas of hypointensity. These findings suggest that after anoxic-ischemic damage, normal axonal transportation of brain iron can no longer occur. This may lead to increased accumulation of iron centrally at the sites of iron uptake in the basal ganglia and in the white matter. Additional iron deposition may occur more rapidly due to direct injury by lipid peroxidation degradation products catalyzed by iron.\r"

Control values for partition coefficient and LCBF obtained from control subjects with minor head trauma in the chronic stage were compatible with those in several past reports, and reproducibility was satisfactory. The theoretic grounds underlying this new method of curve-fitting analysis are discussed.\r"

With use of clinical history in addition to plain radiography, pluridirectional tomography, and computed tomography, these two fractures can be clearly separated. This distinction carries important surgical and prognostic implications.\r"

The midvertebral section is defined by all points with equal perpendicular distance to the regression lines fitted through these end-plate contours. The algorithm can be corrected by manual interaction in case of failure. It was tested on T-12 to L-4 vertebrae on 25 randomly selected localizer radiographs. Of the 250 endplate contours, 223 (89.2%) were tracked automatically; the remaining 27 (10.8%) required user interaction for successful completion.\r"

  ".W": "Most clinical quantitative computed tomographic (CT) determinations of bone mineral content are hampered by inability to properly account for the various substances contained within the spongiosa (spongy bone). In general, the presence of adipose tissue lowers the CT numbers (Hounsfield units) and leads to underestimation of bone mineral content. Collagen matrix has the opposite effect. A new approach to obtaining data from postreconstruction dual-energy CT scans accounts for five principal constituents of the spongiosa. In addition to bone mineral values, the method also provides the adipose tissue concentration, calcium content, and density of the total trabecular space. Since calcium values are provided, the measurements can be compared with prereconstruction dual-energy data that are acquired simultaneously. A new solid-plastic calibration phantom was utilized in this study, and data were obtained from 26 subjects. Dual-energy data were correlated with single-energy measurements (r greater than .96), and calcium measurements were correlated with the bone mineral determinations (r = .97) in these 26 cases. All measurements of the various vertebral constituents agreed with published values.\r"

At surgery, 50 patients had infections, as determined by means of culture or histologic results. The diagnostic accuracy of In-111 scanning was compared with that of plain radiography, arthrography, three-phase bone scanning, and various clinical and laboratory findings classically associated with infection. Positive findings on In-111 WBC scans and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates were found to be the most predictive variables in the diagnosis of septic prostheses (P less than or equal to .001 and P less than or equal to .002, respectively). Likelihood ratio analysis more clearly demonstrated the superiority of In-111 WBC scanning, with positive and negative scans yielding likelihood ratios of 5.0 and 0.16, respectively.\r"

Neither fetus demonstrated radionuclide uptake above maternal background levels. The uterine activity showed rapid clearance, with an effective half-life of 12 minutes after reaching a maximum within 1 minute after injection. Major contribution to fetal dose comes from the presence of the radionuclide in the maternal bladder. The authors conclude that bone scintigraphy performed unknowingly in pregnant individuals presents negligible increased risk to the fetus.\r"

The temperature dependence of MR relaxation mechanisms and the high sensitivity of MR to changes in the mobility and distribution of tissue water make it particularly suitable for the demonstration and control of thermal energy deposition in tissues. In heterogeneous tissues, MR imaging does not follow changing temperatures directly because even in the case of reversible thermal interactions, there is a hysteresis in the dynamic relationship between MR signal intensity and temperature. Appropriate matching of the laser and MR pulse sequences can, however, optimize the detection of relatively small laser energy deposition, and reversible and irreversible tissue changes can be distinguished. There is a potential for the integration of MR imaging and lasers for three-dimensional control and monitoring of laser-tissue interactions.\r"

Eight-week-old ICR male mice were irradiated (cobalt-60 radiation) with 5, 6, or 7 Gy given either alone or followed by MR imaging. Other groups received fractionated doses of 6 Gy (3 Gy + 3 Gy) or 7 Gy (3 Gy + 4 Gy) either with or without subsequent MR imaging. Ten days after exposure, spleens were assayed for endogenous spleen colonies. The number of spleen colonies was lower at higher radiation doses, and fractionation of the dose resulted in an increase in colony number compared with a comparable dose in a single exposure. No difference was seen, however, between comparable radiation groups that were or were not subjected to MR imaging. In addition to the spleen colony assay, body weights and wet weights for spleen, thymus, and testes were obtained, since these suffer weight loss in proportion to radiation dose. As with the spleen colony assay, no significant effect of MR imaging was observed. These results indicate that for the normal tissues studied, MR imaging neither increases radiation damage nor inhibits repair between fractions.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective multiinstitutional study was performed to compare the ability of dynamic sequential contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT), delayed contrast material-enhanced CT, and two T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) sequences (spin echo and inversion recovery) to demonstrate metastatic disease in the liver and abdomen in patients with cancer. All four techniques had comparable rates of hepatic lesion detection when compared individually or when the combined CT techniques were compared with the combined MR techniques. The sensitivity to hepatic disease was 96% (27 of 28 patients) for the combined MR techniques versus 93% (26 of 28 patients) for the combined CT techniques. However, CT was statistically superior in the detection of extrahepatic disease, with significant extrahepatic findings demonstrated by CT in only 12 of 59 patients (20%). For this reason, the authors continue to recommend CT in the initial screening of patients with cancer for upper abdominal metastatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "Data derived from the first 30 months of operation of a low-cost mammography screening program demonstrate the impact of the introduction of low-cost screening on nearby mammography practices. Low-cost screening attracts a very different group of women than traditionally populate existing practices, and 93% represent \"new business\" rather than established mammography patients seeking examination at a lower price. Although low-cost screening does divert some women away from more expensive nearby practices, it also generates an approximately equal number of breast imaging cases for these neighbor practices, including problem-solving examinations to further evaluate screening-detected abnormalities and subsequent screening examinations for women who prefer more full-featured albeit costlier screening. Finally, a survey of nearby practices indicates that the introduction of low-cost screening had no measurable impact on the steadily increasing mammography case loads observed during the study period. Low-cost screening does not appear to be much of an economic threat to existing mammography practices, at least under the conditions in effect in the study area. It can indeed coexist successfully with traditional mammography practices that make no distinction in features and price between screening and problem-solving examinations.\r"

Hydrostatic and increased permeability edemas were distinguished by means of the ratio of pulmonary edema fluid protein to plasma protein concentration and clinical and hemodynamic data. Chest radiographs were classified as showing hydrostatic, increased permeability, or mixed edema by three independent readers without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis. Overall, 87% of patients with hydrostatic edema but only 60% of patients with increased permeability edema were correctly identified. A patchy, peripheral distribution of edema was the single most discriminating criterion and was relatively specific for increased permeability edema, occurring in 13% of patients with hydrostatic and 50% with increased permeability edema (P less than .05). Some features considered more typical of hydrostatic edema were commonly found in patients with increased permeability, including a widened vascular pedicle (56%), pleural effusions (36%), peribronchial cuffs (72%), and septal lines (40%). The authors conclude that chest radiography is limited in the differentiation of type of pulmonary edema in severe cases.\r"

The helix hypothesis, introduced here, provides a tentative answer to this question. The hypothesis states that a necessary condition for helix formation is the presence of residues flanking the helix termini whose side chains can form hydrogen bonds with the initial four-helix greater than N-H groups and final four-helix greater than C-O groups; these eight groups would otherwise lack intrahelical partners. This simple hypothesis implies the existence of a stereochemical code in which certain sequences have the hydrogen-bonding capacity to function as helix boundaries and thereby enable the helix to form autonomously. The three-dimensional structure of a protein is a consequence of the genetic code, but the rules relating sequence to structure are still unknown. The ensuing analysis supports the idea that a stereochemical code for the alpha helix resides in its boundary residues.\r"

The results confirm earlier observations, such as asymmetrical charge distributions in the first and last helical turn, but several new, sharp preferences are found as well. The most striking of these are a 3.5:1 preference for Asn at the N-cap position, and a preference of 2.6:1 for Pro at N-cap + 1. The C-cap position is overwhelmingly dominated by Gly, which ends 34 percent of the helices. Hydrophobic residues peak at positions N-cap + 4 and C-cap - 4.\r"

In addition to its action on adenylate cyclase, forskolin directly alters the gating of a single class of voltage-dependent potassium channels from a clonal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line. This alteration occurred in isolated cell-free patches independent of soluble cytoplasmic enzymes. The effect of forskolin was distinct from those of other agents that raise intracellular cAMP levels. The 1,9-dideoxy derivative of forskolin, which is unable to activate the cyclase, was also effective in altering the potassium channel activity. This direct action of forskolin can lead to misinterpretation of results in experiments in which forskolin is assumed to selectively activate adenylate cyclase.\r"

In studies that support this conclusion researchers have used forskolin to stimulate cAMP-dependent phosphorylation in intact muscle. It is now shown that although forskolin facilitated desensitization in voltage-clamped rat muscle, this effect was not correlated with the abilities of forskolin and forskolin analogs to activate adenylate cyclase or phosphorylate the receptor. Furthermore, elevation of intracellular cAMP or addition of the catalytic subunit of A-kinase failed to alter desensitization. Therefore, in intact skeletal muscle, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation does not modulate desensitization.\r"

Because 5-HT mediates short-term facilitation through adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein phosphorylation, the role of cAMP in the long-term modulation of this identified synapse was examined. Like 5-HT, cAMP can also evoke long-term facilitation lasting 24 hours. Unlike the short-term change, the long-lasting change is blocked by anisomycin, a reversible inhibitor of protein synthesis, and therefore must involve the synthesis of gene products not required for the short-term change.\r"

  ".U": "88248715\r", 
  ".W": "A specific, reversible binding site for a free amino acid is detectable on the intron of the Tetrahymena self-splicing ribosomal precursor RNA. The site selects arginine among the natural amino acids, and prefers the L- to the D-amino acid. The dissociation constant is in the millimolar range, and amino acid binding is at or in the catalytic rG splicing substrate site. Occupation of the G site by L-arginine therefore inhibits splicing by inhibiting the binding of rG, without inhibition of later reactions in the splicing reaction sequence. Arginine binding specificity seems to be directed at the side chain and the guanidino radical, and the alpha-amino and carboxyl groups are dispensable for binding. The arginine site can be placed within the G site by structural homology, with consequent implications for RNA-amino acid interaction, for the origin of the genetic code, for control of RNA activities, and for further catalytic capabilities for RNA.\r"

However, after acoustic trauma, injured sensory cells in the mature cochlea of the chicken are replaced. New cells appear to be produced by mitosis of supporting cells that survive at the lesion site and do not divide in the absence of trauma. This trauma-induced division of normally postmitotic cells may lead to recovery from profound hearing loss.\r"

Within 10 days of acoustic trauma, incorporation of [3H]thymidine was seen over the nuclei of hair cells and supporting cells in the region of initial hair cell loss. Thus, hair cell regeneration can occur after embryonic terminal mitosis.\r"

In this study of the interactions of PAF with neuronal cells, it was found that PAF increased the intracellular levels of free calcium ions in cells of the clones NG108-15 and PC12. The increase was dependent on extracellular calcium and was inhibited by the antagonistic PAF analog CV-3988 and by the calcium-influx blockers prenylamine and diltiazem. A functional consequence of this interaction was revealed by measuring a PAF-elicited, Ca2+-dependent secretion of adenosine triphosphate from PC12 cells. Exposure of NG108-15 cells for 3 to 4 days to low concentrations of PAF induced neuronal differentiation; higher concentrations were neurotoxic. Thus, by influencing Ca2+ fluxes, PAF may play a physiological role in neuronal development and a pathophysiological role in the degeneration that occurs when neurons are exposed to circulatory factors as a result of trauma, stroke, or spinal cord injury.\r"

An experimental animal model of cervical spondylotic myelopathy was produced by combining anterior cervical cord compression with occlusion of the cervical vertebral arteries in dogs. Spinal cord pathology at the site of compression was characteristically different and depended on the type of load; that is, peripheral necrosis of the central gray matter in systemic hypotension, capillary congestion and subarachnoid hemorrhage in systemic hypertension, and linear necrosis of the transversely elongated central gray matter combined with occluded anterior spinal artery in cervical hyperflexion, and the pathologic severity was proportional to the number of loadings. This study suggests that cervical spondylotic myelopathy might progress stepwise rather than linearly when these aggravating factors are loaded.\r"

In addition, eight cadaver vertebrae were CT scanned and then cut transversely to compare x-ray measurements with direct physical measurements. Measured parameters included pedicle width, pedicle length, angle of pedicle axis to sagittal plane, and transpedicular cortex-to-cortex chord length.

Forty-two patients meeting specified inclusion criteria were contacted and completed questionnaires. In all cases, nonoperative treatment was the only treatment received. The average time from injury to follow-up was 20.2 years (range, 11 to 55 years). The average age at follow-up was 43 years (range, 28 to 70 years). There were 31 men and 11 women in this series. Seventy-one percent of the injuries were the result of motor vehicle accidents. The most common sites of injury were T12-L2, which accounted for 64% of the injuries. Seventy-eight percent of the patients had no neurologic deficits at the time of injury. At follow-up, the average back pain score was 3.5, with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being very severe pain. No patient demonstrated a decrease in their neurologic status at follow-up, and no patient required narcotic medication for pain control. Eighty-eight percent of patients were able to work at their usual level of activity. Follow-up radiographs revealed an average kyphosis angle of 26.4 degrees in flexion and 16.8 degrees in extension. The degree of kyphosis did not correlate with pain or function at follow-up. Based on this review, nonoperative treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures remains as a viable alternative in patients without neurologic deficit and can lead to acceptable long-term results.\r"

Ten normal subjects (five men, five women), ages 24 to 34 years old, were examined in full flexion, full extension, and the erect position, both standing and sitting. Repeatability was poor for the fingertip-to-floor method in all postures and for the two-inclinometer method in full flexion. Although other methods for various postures had good repeatability, the modified Schober method of determining lumbar spinal motion was the most repeatable and is recommended for a routine, noninvasive, clinical evaluation of lumbar spinal motion.\r"

Thirty normal subjects were tested on the Cybex Trunk Extension/Flexion (TEF) and Liftask (LT) machines during maximal (100%) and submaximal (50%) efforts. Considering each test separately, visual assessments of curve variability were indeterminate of degree of effort in 28% of TEF and 34% of LT tests. Measurement models of curve variability were more clearly discriminating. When a given subject's test curves were considered together, scaled visual assessments identified the degree of effort in 91% of TEF and 86% of LT results. The measurement models were accurate 90-92% of TEF and 79-92% of LT results. Clinical judgment is required in evaluating effort during tests of isokinetic trunk and lifting strength.\r"

Twenty-two consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of lumbar facet syndrome, made by conventional diagnostic criteria, who were then treated with facet joint injection, were reviewed for their treatment responses. New diagnostic criteria were formulated based on a scoring system derived from the values observed in this review study. The scoring system has a total of 100 points, allocated as follows: back pain associated with groin or thigh pain, 30 points; well-localized paraspinal tenderness, 20 points; reproduction of pain with extension-rotation, 30 points; corresponding radiographic changes, 20 points; and pain below the knee, -10 points. A score of 60 points or more indicates a very high probability of satisfactory response to facet joint injection (100% prolonged response in this study). When only the conventional criteria were used, the overall results of prolonged relief of pain after facet joint injection was 50%. A \"scorecard\" system is proposed that may give a higher degree of diagnostic accuracy and predictability of successful response to facet joint injection.\r"

The imaging studies were blind-reviewed and the results were compared with the clinical and surgical findings. Sagittal, planar, and curved coronal two-dimensional (2-D) reformations were more useful in the detection of bony nonunion than were axial CT scans, as the latter required more extensive analysis. Three-dimensional surface \"cuts\" adequately demonstrated pseudarthrosis in most cases. In some instances, however, segmentation artifacts created artifactual clefts or implied solidity, which contrasted with the interpretation of the 2-D images. Sagittal 3-D cuts were helpful in demonstrating bony central and lateral stenosis. Three-dimensional surface reconstructions demonstrated superficial clefts and outlined the complex anatomy of the spinal fusions, thus facilitating pre- and intraoperative planning. The amount of bone stock available for pseudarthrosis repair at the fusion site and the need for additional harvesting of bone from the iliac crest also could be assessed easily. 3-D CT proved to be useful as an adjunctive imaging method in the evaluation of posterior lumbar fusion patients suspected of pseudarthrosis.\r"

This is compared to 11.2% of the remaining 678 discs without end-plate disruption that reproduced severe concordant pain, 31.1% with moderately severe concordant pain, 17.1% with mild pain, and 40.6% without any pain reproduction. The difference between pain frequency in discs with end-plate disruption and those without is statistically significant (P less than .001). This suggests that end-plate disruptions may be related to painful segments.\r"

Surgical exploration of patients with a Group 1 response (typical pain reproduced by needle placement and then relieved by NRI) confirmed local root pathology in all. Exclusive of patients with arachnoiditis, a Group 1 response showed 85% accuracy in identifying a single symptomatic root. A Group 2 response (typical pain reproduced by needle placement but not relieved by local anesthesia) indicated multiple root involvement. Patients with a Group 3 or Group 4 response (typical pain not reproduced by needle insertion, with or without relief of pain by local anesthesia) were seldom relieved of radicular pain. NRI was most useful in investigation of patients with radicular symptoms in whom other investigations were 1) normal, 2) showed multiple level involvement, or 3) were difficult to interpret because of previous surgery.\r"

There were 54 good, 10 fair, and 27 poor results after chemonucleolysis. Good versus fair/poor outcome groups differed preoperatively on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) Hypochondriasis (Hs), Hysteria (Hy), Psychopathic Deviate (Pd), Paranoia (Pa), Hypomania (Ma), and Social Introversion (Si) scales. Presence of compensation issues at the time of surgery was significantly related to outcome, and the MMPI scales provided additional predictive power. Nineteen patients who did not show improvement with chemonucleolysis subsequently underwent lumbar laminectomy and discectomy, and the ultimate outcome for the entire series including these laminectomy patients was 66 good, 10 fair, and 15 poor results. Good versus fair/poor ultimate outcome patients differed significantly on preoperative MMPI Hypochondriasis, Hysteria, Psychopathic Deviate, Paranoia, Psychasthenia, Schizophrenia, Hypomania, and Social Introversion scales. After controlling for the effects of compensation issues, MMPI scales added significantly to the ability to predict ultimate surgical outcome. However, the MMPI could not be used with confidence to predict the outcome for a given patient and should serve only to alert the surgeon to the presence of psychological risk factors and the possible need for referral for psychological evaluation and treatment.\r"

The authors reviewed 28 cases where the patients had undergone chymopapain injection to determine the significance of disc herniation size, disc space height reduction, and the duration of symptoms on clinical outcome. All patients had a complete history, physical examination, and discogram, and most had pre- and post-injection computerized tomography (CT) or myelogram. Nine of the 28 patients were considered clinical failures. Seven underwent laminectomy and discectomy and were improved markedly. Two patients were advised to have surgery but refused and were considered clinical failures. The causes of failure were unknown in three patients, free fragment in two patients, and diabetic neuropathy in one. Only two patients who did well showed complete resolution of the disc deformity on repeat CT scan. The remainder still had evidence of an avascular deformity that persisted although reduced in size. The failures showed no changes in disc size. The height of the disc space was too variable to be correlated with clinical outcome. Patients who failed had a longer duration of symptoms than the ones who did well (15.1 months for failures vs. 5 months). Therefore, some reduction of disc deformity size, but not necessarily complete reduction, is necessary for a good result, and the enzyme is not as effective in patients with long-standing symptoms.\r"

The values obtained with this model, with roentgenograms of the cervical spine, and vector analysis were close enough to establish that the model is apparently valid for studying the extensor musculature of the cervical spine. Because the extensors appear to generate considerable force and may act as significant dynamic stabilizers of the cervical spine, the authors have altered their posterior surgical approach to minimize disruption of the extensor musculature.\r"

Preoperative evaluation was directed towards determining the presence or absence of nerve root compression. The patients without nerve root compression typically underwent fusion alone, while those with evidence of nerve root compression had decompression and fusion. After an average 36-month follow-up, results were good in 78%, fair in 18%, and poor in 4%. There were five complications, all of which were successfully managed. Two patients required reoperation for pseudoarthrosis. An eventual 100% fusion rate was achieved. Results in the patients with Grade III or Grade IV olisthesis were nearly equivalent to the less severe cases. Nine patients received allograft, with a fusion rate equal to the 32 receiving autogenous bone. This study suggests that in patients who have isthmic spondylolisthesis with mechanical lumbar symptoms only, or in patients with low-back pain with radicular extremity pain caused by nerve root irritation, fusion alone is indicated. In patients with documented radiculopathy resulting from nerve root compression, decompression in addition to fusion is indicated.\r"

A prospective study of 26 patients undergoing uncomplicated discectomy or fusion was made. ESRs were measured preoperatively and at 1,2, and 6 weeks after operation. Any patient with increasing back pain and an ESR greater than 52 or more weeks after surgery should be considered to have discitis until proven otherwise. If the ESR is measured routinely preoperatively and at 2 weeks postoperatively, this condition should not be missed.\r"

The opposite extremity is visualized at the same time for comparison of the venous systems and the associated muscle and limb swelling of the thrombosed side. There is less pain and risk of serious skin extravasation with contrast material given intravenously in the arm compared with the standard method for venogram using a foot vein. Repeat tests can be easily performed for follow-up studies after thrombolytic or anticoagulant therapy.\r"

  ".W": "An analysis of 1,200 consecutive transduodenal sphincterotomies performed between 1967 and 1985 is presented herein. The over-all mortality rate was 3.75 per cent. Since 1980, however, the mortality rate has decreased to 2.1 per cent. The mortality rate was influenced by the age of the patient at the time of the operation (p less than 0.005). Furthermore, the mortality rate increased from decade to decade (less than 30 years, zero per cent; greater than 70 years, 6 per cent). The operative mortality rate was also influenced by general risk factors--hypertony (mortality rate of 5.8 per cent, not significant), diabetes (mortality rate of 6.5 per cent, p congruent to 0.05), renal failure (15.5 per cent, p less than 0.005), jaundice (bilirubin level in survivors, 78.3 micromoles per liter and in those who died, 120.4 micromoles per liter, p less than 0.005) and vital indication (mortality rate of 15 per cent, p less than 0.01). Although the indication for sphincterotomy had a small influence on the mortality (papilla stenosis without bile duct stones, 1.7 per cent; papilla stenosis with common duct stones, 3.6 per cent, and impacted stones in the papilla, 5.0 per cent), these small differences are not significant. A significant influence, however, was due to complicating intraoperative findings, such as bilioenteral fistulas (a mortality rate of 10.8 per cent, p less than 0.0005). The fact that the mortality rate increased in patients with T-tube insertion shows that operative problems and complications influence the mortality rate for sphincterotomy. From these results, we concluded that, in the aforementioned risk groups, a preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy should be strongly considered, as the risk from the surgical procedure is diminished by the endoscopic relief of the obstruction of the biliary tract.\r"

Two patients initially required urgent laparotomy for drainage of infected abdominal collections. Distal obstruction of the bile duct below the origin of the fistula was present in five patients. Repair of the bile duct was undertaken after careful investigation and correction of nutritional, fluid and electrolyte status in five patients who had little prospect of spontaneous closure of the fistula. The other seven patients were initially treated conservatively; in three, the fistula closed at five to nine weeks without complication, and no further surgical treatment has been required (a range of six to 36 months). The remaining four patients required delayed operation after the development of cholangitis or jaundice. The overall median survival time between development of fistula and operative repair was 3.5 months, and all nine of these patients remained asymptomatic with normal results from liver function tests (a median follow-up period of 17 months). The need for careful initial assessment prior to repair of the bile duct and the possibility of conservative treatment for patients with a postcholecystectomy fistula of the biliary tract are emphasized.\r"

It is our opinion that physical examination in the standing position is the simplest and most accurate test. Cystometrogram is important, although the yield is small. We do not advise the routine use of urethral pressure profile. For accurate determination of anatomic deformity, roentgenographic examination is the most accurate test.\r"
