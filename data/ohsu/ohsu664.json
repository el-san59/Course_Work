  ".W": "To determine the relative importance of arachidonic acid pathway products on vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation (VF), we examined the effects of synthesis inhibitors and a receptor blocker acting in the cyclooxygenase (C) and lipoxygenase (L) pathways on VF thresholds in a feline model of coronary occlusion. Thresholds for the induction of VF wer measured before and after a 5-minute coronary occlusion in drug-treated animals and control subjects. Animals were treated with BW755c, a dual L and C inhibitor, CGS-8515, and L inhibitor, FPL-55712, a leukotriene receptor blocker, or sulfinpyrazone, a C inhibitor. BW755c, CGS-8515, and FPL-55712 all prevented an otherwise significant fall in VF threshold during coronary occlusion (p less than 0.01) independent of an effect on effective refractory period, heart rate, or blood pressure. In contrast, sulfinpyrazone, the only compound devoid of an effect on the L pathway, did not protect against an occlusion-related fall in VF threshold. BW755c and CGS-8515 inhibited the synthesis of L and C metabolites coincident with their protection against VF (p less than 0.01). We conclude that agents that antagonize the effects of L products protect against enhanced ventricular vulnerability during acute ischemia, whereas C inhibition alone may not afford this protection.\r"

Since intake of fish-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decreases serum triglycerides, we examined the effects of omega-3 PUFA maximum eicosapentaenoic acid (Max EPA) intake on PAI-1 levels in eight patients with coronary artery disease and in four normal subjects. After 4 weeks of Max-EPA intake by coronary artery disease patients, serum triglyceride concentrations and PAI-1 levels decreased 43 +/- 8% and 21 +/- 5%, respectively (both p less than or equal to 0.01) without any change in tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) levels. No changes were noted at 1 week of Max EPA intake in normal subjects, but at 3 weeks serum triglyceride concentrations and PAI-1 levels decreased 32 +/- 13% and 22 +/- 4%, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.01) without any change in tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) levels. No changes were noted at 1 week of Max EPA intake in normal subjects, but at 3 weeks serum triglyceride concentrations and PAI-1 levels decreased 32 +/- 13% and 22 +/- 4%, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.02) without change in TPA. The magnitude of reduction in triglycerides was dependent on the initial serum concentration (r = 0.68, p less than or equal to 0.01). In addition, decrease in PAI-1 levels correlated with reduction in serum triglycerides (r = 0.79, p less than or equal to 0.01). This study shows that omega-3 PUFA intake reduces PAI-1 levels without change in TPA antigen. These observations may relate to decrease in thrombotic activity upon consumption of large amounts of fish or fish-derived products.\r"

  ".W": "During sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), there is usually a rise in mean atrial pressure. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide released by the atria in response to increased atrial pressure or distension. ANF causes arterial vasodilation and natriuresis in man, and may contribute to the polyuria noted during tachycardia. We hypothesized that induction of sustained VT would cause elevation of right atrial pressure and lead to increased release of ANF. We measured mean arterial pressure, right atrial pressure, VT cycle length, atrial cycle length, plasma norepinephrine, and central ANF in 11 patients during 20 episodes of VT. The mean cycle length of induced tachycardia was 335 +/- 15 msec, with a mean atrial cycle length of 547 +/- 43 msec. Baseline plasma ANF was 70 +/- 11 femtomoles per milliliter and increased to 133 +/- 22 fmol/ml (p less than 0.001) after 4 minutes of VT. There was a decrease in mean arterial pressure from 87 +/- 3 to 66 +/- 3 mm Hg, and a rise in mean right atrial pressure from 4.0 +/- 0.8 to 11 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The change in plasma ANF was quite variable among individual patients and was correlated with changes in  mean right atrial pressure but poorly correlated with changes in mean arterial pressure, plasma norepinephrine, and atrial cycle length. Our data demonstrate that significant increased in ANF levels occur during sustained VT and are associated with increased right atrial pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of combination drug therapy in the suppression of ambient ventricular arrhythmia was retrospectively evaluated in a study of 49 patients discharged from the hospital taking 2 membrane-active antiarrhythmic agents. Thirty-one patients (63%) had ischemic heart disease, 15 had miscellaneous cardiac disorders and 3 were free of ostensible heart disease. Therapy in all patients had previously been unsuccessful with an average of 3.7 single membrane-active drugs. Antiarrhythmic agents were discontinued for at least 48 hours to determine baseline arrhythmia levels by Holter monitoring and maximal exercise treadmill testing. Ventricular premature beats were evaluated according to the grading system of Lown and Wolf. Data on ventricular ectopic activity were obtained during Holter monitoring and exercise testing for both a control (\"drug-free\") period and for a period of combination therapy. During the control period, ventricular tachycardia was recorded during 23% of monitored hours, and the level was nearly twofold greater during stress testing. After institution of combined therapy, the percent of monitored hours of arrhythmia were reduced during Holter monitoring, with a greater reduction in couplets and ventricular tachycardia than in single ventricular premature beats. Ventricular tachycardia was more difficult to provoke by exercise testing in patients taking combination therapy than in control subjects. These data indicate that combination therapy can significantly reduce the density of ventricular ectopic activity in patients refractory to monotherapy. During an average follow-up of 26 months, 23 patients (47%) were able to receive decreased drug dosages, affording diminished adverse effects and improved tolerance to long-term use.\r"

These patients then underwent supine rest, exercise and after-nitroglycerin radionuclide angiography 3 weeks after AMI. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging was performed at 3 weeks as a more direct estimate of AMI size. Although peak creatine kinase values were comparably elevated between groups (2,367 +/- 1,486 IU/liter for streptokinase vs 2,637 +/- 1,305 IU/liter for placebo), there was a significant reduction in NMR-measured AMI size in the streptokinase group (3 +/- 2% of left ventricular volume vs 10 +/- 4% in the placebo group, p less than 0.05). This occurred despite comparable resting (54 +/- 11 vs 47 +/- 10% and exercise (53 +/- 12 vs 49 +/- 11%) global ejection fractions. However, following nitroglycerin, there was an improvement in global ejection fraction in the streptokinase-treated group that was not observed with placebo (61 +/- 13 vs 48 +/- 10%, p less than 0.05). A similar pattern was also observed with regional functional analysis. Thus, streptokinase therapy leads to a significant reduction in NMR-measured AMI size and to a greater degree of reversible left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

Significant negative correlations were observed between plasma alpha-tocopherol levels and HPN duration and between pentane output and plasma alpha-tocopherol levels (r = -0.58, p less than 0.01). In HPN patients with reduced plasma alpha-tocopherol levels associated with increased pentane output, there is, inferentially, increased lipid peroxidation despite normal plasma Se and Se-GSHPx levels.\r"

Gastric acid and decreased gastric mucosal blood flow appear to be important in the pathogenesis of these lesions. Occult bleeding from stress ulcers is common, although significant bleeding occurs in less than 20% of patients. The mortality of bleeding is dependent on the severity of the underlying diseases. A number of processes have been suggested as risk factors; however, prolonged mechanical ventilation, a coagulopathy, and the presence of more than one risk factor place the patient at greatest risk. Titration of the gastric pH to greater than four with either antacids or H2-receptor antagonists provides effective prophylaxis. The continuous infusion of the H2-receptor antagonists is also efficacious. Sucralfate appears to be another useful alternative with several potential advantages. Prophylactic therapy decreases the incidence of stress ulcer-related bleeding, although it does little to improve the survival of the critically ill patient.\r"

The primary disease in all of the patients was liver cirrhosis. Propranolol infusion markedly reduced the flow velocity in the varices, intercostal vein, azygos vein, and thoracic aorta (-24%, -41%, -34%, and -24%, respectively). It also significantly reduced the blood flow volume index (BFVI), defined as mean velocity in cm/sec X the square of the diameter in cm2 of both the azygos vein and the aorta (-34%, -21%, respectively). Nitroglycerin infusion did not cause significant changes in the hemodynamics of the above vessels, because the hemodynamic responses to the drug differed from individual to individual. The BFVI of the azygos vein correlated well with the azygos venous flow measured by the conventional thermodilution technique (r = 0.79, p less than 0.01). TE2DD appears to be a useful method for studying the hemodynamics of ascending collaterals in patients with portal hypertension.\r"

The IgAN population increased in number by only 5% if the IgA immunostaining criterion was lowered to 1+, and it decreased by only 2% if IgA codominant staining was disallowed. A distinctive immunohistologic feature of IgAN in comparison with other immune complex-mediated glomerulopathies, in addition to the predominance of IgA immunostaining, was a high frequency (67%) of patients with greater lambda- than kappa-immunoglobulin light chain immunostaining. There was no correlation between the absolute or relative intensities or frequencies of IgA, IgG, or IgM immunostaining and the severity of glomerular disease; however, the presence of capillary wall immune deposits correlated with more severe disease. Terminal complement components were consistently present and were more conspicuous in more severely injured glomeruli. Immunostaining for the early classical complement activation pathway component C1q was absent or scanty in IgAN. This finding was particularly useful in the immunohistologic differentiation of IgAN from proliferative lupus glomerulonephritis, which was the form of glomerulonephritis with the greatest overlap with IgAN with respect to IgA immunostaining. When the diagnostic criteria for IgAN were 2+ or greater, dominant or codominant mesangial IgA immunostaining and less than 2+ C1q immunostaining, an immunohistologic diagnosis of IgAN was made with 98% accuracy.\r"

Routine preoperative intravenous pyelograms might decrease the risk of such injuries during hysterectomy in cases of nonmalignant disease, but no prospective studies have been conducted to determine their effectiveness. Since gynecologists must frequently decide whether to obtain pyelograms, we used decision analysis to determine how costly routine pyelograms would be and under what circumstance pyelograms might be especially justifiable. Our cost-effectiveness study was based on decision analysis techniques, with the best available estimates from the literature, and on expert opinion. These estimates were varied over a broad range during a sensitivity analysis so as not to bias the results. At a baseline ureteral incidence injury rate of 0.5%, the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio indicates 833 pyelograms would be obtained to prevent a single injury and approximately $3.33 million would be spent to prevent a single death. As the probability of an injury increases, the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio is less dependent on the test efficacy and is more modest. Since abnormal ureteral anatomy probably predicts ureteral injury, we suggest selectively obtaining preoperative pyelograms only when the probability of an abnormality is high.\r"

We present a preliminary report using a new approach of direct fetal blood sampling for the diagnosis and treatment of these patients. This form of evaluation provides specific information about fetal red blood cell antigen status and the degree of fetal anemia at an earlier gestational age than that validated by the Liley curves and eliminates empiricism from both the diagnosis and treatment of the isoimmunized pregnancy. The use of such a management protocol reduces the need for multiple invasive procedures in fetuses at little risk for disease and provides specific information about the status of those fetuses truly at risk.\r"

There were no statistically significant differences when the mean umbilical arterial or venous pH, PCO2, and base deficit were compared among any one triplet and the other two. Similarly, no significant differences were found when these parameters were compared by birth order in relation to mean 5-minute Apgar scores, mean birth weights, and mean gestational ages at delivery. Birth order did not appear to significantly influence acid-base status, although it may become significant with an increasing time in utero after delivery of the firstborn infant. Further study is necessary to investigate whether there is a critical interval of delivery whereby the infants remaining in utero become acidotic.\r"

  ".W": "Acute hypoxia in the fetus is associated with a reduction in fetal blood volume. We hypothesized that atrial natriuretic factor in the fetal circulation may be one of the factors that mediate this blood volume decrease. Thus the present study was designed to determine the effects of hypoxia on circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor in fetal sheep and correlate these changes with fetal blood volume. Hypoxia was induced in chronically catheterized sheep fetuses by infusing nitrogen containing CO2 into the trachea of the ewe for 30 minutes. Fetal arterial PO2 decreased by 10.2 +/- 1.3 (SE) mm Hg. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration rose concurrently with the fall in PO2 such that atrial natriuretic factor increased to 565 +/- 196 pg/ml from a basal level of 127 +/- 13 pg/ml (p less than 0.001). Fetal blood volume was reduced by 7.2% +/- 2.1% and was significantly related to changes in atrial natriuretic factor levels (p less than 0.0001). At the termination of hypoxia, PO2 returned to normal levels before plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor fell to baseline values. Therefore fetal hypoxia appears to be a potent stimulus for elevating plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the fetus, and this rise in atrial natriuretic factor in the circulation may be partially responsible for the reduction in fetal blood volume observed during hypoxia.\r"

Ten infants exposed to meperidine (2 mg/kg maternal dose) or alfentanil (0.1 mg/kg maternal dose) were compared with seven controls whose dams received no analgesic. No group differences in weight gain or body growth were observed. Alfentanil-exposed infants appeared to have a higher incidence of infections requiring veterinary treatment. Measures of spontaneous activity showed a significantly higher incidence of immature rest pattern (laying) in the alfentanil group associated with lower overall locomotor activity relative to controls. Meperidine-exposed infants had a generally higher overall level of locomotor activity than controls that was statistically significant at 11 weeks of age. Alfentanil-exposed animals were impaired in performance of a simple cognitive task (object constancy) at 2 to 3 months of age and meperidine-exposed infants showed a similar nonsignificant trend. Gross and fine motor maturations were similar to those of controls. Thus, in this situation, the impact of obstetric analgesic treatment was demonstrable for several months after birth in some limited areas.\r"

Initial deposition of 238PuO2 in the respiratory tract was followed by translocation of a portion of the 238Pu to the liver and skeleton, which resulted in a large dose commitment and tumor risk to all three tissues. In a population of 144 dogs exposed to 238PuO2, 112 dogs died or were killed 4000 days after 238Pu exposure, 100 dogs had osteosarcoma, and 28 dogs had lung cancers. At increasing times after exposure, however, liver lesions have become more pronounced. Ten primary liver tumors in nine animals were diagnosed in the dogs dying before 4000 days after exposure. An additional five primary liver tumors in three dogs occurred in 9 animals killed after 4000 days after exposure. The majority of these tumors have been fibrosarcomas. The liver tumors were usually not the cause of death, and rarely metastasized. The occurrence of liver tumors in this study indicates that 238Pu is an effective hepatic carcinogen. Liver carcinogenesis is assuming an increasing importance in this study at late times after inhalation exposure. These results suggest that the liver may be an important organ at risk for the development of neoplasia in humans at time periods long after inhalation of 238Pu.\r"

The DHFR-TS content in both strains began to increase significantly from the early trophozoite stage through schizogony. The DHFR-TS content in either the ring or trophozoite-schizont stage parasites remained constant for at least 9 hr in the presence of protein synthesis-inhibitory levels of cycloheximide, which suggested that the measure of enzyme accumulation was a measure of enzyme synthesis. Actinomycin D treated parasites did not accumulate DHFR-TS which suggested that the DHFR-TS mRNA had a short half-life. DHFR-TS accumulated in the presence of aphidicolin inhibition of DNA synthesis which indicated that both syntheses could be uncoupled.\r"

  ".W": "To gain better understanding of the natural history of Schistosoma haematobium associated disease, age- and intensity-related urinary tract morbidity were assessed in a cross-sectional study of Kilole (population 719) in Coast Province, Kenya. Overall prevalence of infection was 65% (39% light, 16% moderate, 9% heavy). Infection prevalence and mean intensity of infection were highest in the 5-14-year-old bracket for both sexes. Although significant intensity-associated increases in hematuria prevalence were noted for both children and adults in all infection categories, hematuria was more common in those less than 15 years of age. Children had a significant increase in the prevalence of dysuria at higher levels of infection, whereas adults did not. Radiographic study of a 1:9 random sample, stratified for age, revealed a greater prevalence of urinary tract granulomas in those less than 15 years. Subjects greater than 15 years of age had a greater frequency of hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and bladder calcification were not associated with higher infection intensity. Among individuals with bladder calcification, a potential marker of cumulative inflammation, 87% had hydronephrosis or hydroureter, compared to a 40% prevalence among individuals without bladder calcification. These findings suggest that certain structural forms of urinary tract disease, such as hydronephrosis, progress during the course of untreated schistosomiasis haematobia despite age-related reductions in egg burden, whereas other forms of morbidity, such as hematuria, remain sensitive to the level of urinary egg excretion at the time of diagnosis.\r"

Transmission of R. typhi by rickettsemic pregnant rats did not occur either transplacentally during gestation to their fetuses or postnatally through colostrum and milk to their newborn. The rickettsial burden of the placenta was sometimes greater than 10(6) plaque forming units per g tissue and undetectable in colostrum or milk. However, newborn rats were highly susceptible to infection per os. Transplacental passage of antirickettsial antibody to offspring was detectable only when the mother's antibody titer was high. Passive postpartum acquisition of antirickettsial antibodies by newborn rats from colostrum and milk of immune mothers occurred regardless of the height of the maternal antibody titer, rose to a maximum at about 3 weeks of age, and then declined rapidly, becoming undetectable 4 weeks after birth.\r"

For most patients, using population pharmacokinetic parameters of alfentanil for dosing regimen allows accurate prediction of the plasma concentration of the drug over time. However, for some patients, using such parameters results in systematic over- or underprediction of the concentration. Retrospectively studying a data set (dosage history and measured concentrations) for 34 patients, the authors examined how Bayesian forecasting could improve the precision of prediction. For each patient, a Bayesian regression was performed to estimate \"individualized\" pharmacokinetic parameters, using population pharmacokinetic values for alfentanil and the measurement of alfentanil in one or more plasma samples from each patient. These individualized parameters were then used to predict the subsequent plasma concentrations of alfentanil over time. By comparing the value of each measured point with its corresponding predicted value, the authors calculated the prediction error as a percentage of the measured value. The precision of the prediction was assessed by the percent mean absolute prediction error. After Bayesian forecasting using a single point sampled at 80 min after start of anesthesia, the average precision of the prediction was 13.8 +/- 6.1% (SD). Using no Bayesian forecasting and only population values of the pharmacokinetic parameters for the prediction of the concentration, the precision was 24.3 +/- 16.9%. The improvement in precision brought by Bayesian forecasting was especially noticeable for those patients whose prediction of alfentanil was poor using population pharmacokinetic values (i.e., \"outlier\" patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The inflation pressure was 100 mmHg over the systolic pressure. Venous blood samples for lactate and blood gas determinations were withdrawn before tourniquet inflation; immediately and at 2, 5, 10, 15 min after tourniquet deflation; and additionally at 30, 45, and 60 min after deflation in the last four volunteers. SSEP stimulating surface electrodes were placed over the ulnar nerve at the wrist. Recording electrodes were placed over the ipsilateral ulnar groove of the elbow, Erb's point, and on the contralateral cortex. Averaged responses were acquired before inflation of the tourniquet, every 5-10 min during tourniquet inflation, and every 5-10 min for 45-60 min after tourniquet deflation. The tourniquet was inflated for 36 +/- 11 min. After deflation of the tourniquet, postdeflation pain and paresthesias were felt by five volunteers; these occurred at 30-120 s after deflation and lasted for 75-120 s. The postdeflation pains were characterized as burning, cramping, paresthesias, buzzing, or severe expansion of the hand. The venous blood lactate levels were significantly elevated for 10 min, and the time course of its change did not correlate with reperfusion pain. The PO2 and O2Hb saturation in venous blood were significantly elevated for 10-15 min after deflation. The elevated lactate and PO2 levels in the presence of a restored blood flow probably result from continued anaerobic muscle metabolism secondary to capillary closure from the tourniquet-induced ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The complement profile of the patient revealed depletion of C4, C2, C1 inhibitor (C1INH) and C1q, with normal values of C3. Patient's offspring had a normal complement profile. Cytofluorographic analysis of the peripheral blood cells showed a marked increase of B cells. In the clotting study, a circulating lupus-like anticoagulant activity (LLA) was detected with a noticeable decrease of prothrombin time. Hepatosplenomegaly was confirmed by abdominal echography and CAT. From the liver biopsy it was concluded to be a lymphoproliferative process compatible with germinal center lymphoma. It is suggested that the neoplasm is probably the origin of the LLA and the cause of C1 activation, producing the biochemical defect of C1INH and the clinical symptoms of angioedema.\r"

  ".W": "Maintenance of a patent vasculature is critical to provide nutrient blood flow to dependent tissues. This is normally facilitated by vessels composed of actively nonthrombogenic endothelium and blood that contains both nonactivated platelets and inactive coagulation proenzymes. Following vessel injury, active hemostasis results from vasoconstriction, adherence and aggregation of activated platelets, and coagulation enzyme activation. The resulting thrombus contains a mixture of blood cells and the insoluble product of coagulation, fibrin, which further stimulates the activation of another blood enzyme system known as the fibrinolytic system. This results in the conversion by plasminogen activators of the circulating plasma proenzyme plasminogen into the active fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin, which dissolves the clot into degradation products. Vascular patency ultimately is restored and healing is thus facilitated. The hemostatic system is highly regulated by a variety of processes. Derangement of regulation can lead to disease manifesting either as thrombosis or hemorrhage. Furthermore, improved understanding of the molecular interactions involved in these processes has led to design of newer therapeutic interventions targeted toward amelioration of the sequelae of thromboembolic disease.\r"

  ".W": "The concepts of acute, potentially reversible coronary artery thrombosis and myocardial salvage by early coronary thrombolysis using pharmacologic agents and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty have evolved rapidly since 1980. Broad, general application of these methods awaited clear data on efficacy and safety of proposed treatment regimens, and in May 1987 streptokinase was recommended for approval by the Food and Drug Administration for intravenous use in patients with acute myocardial infarction. A second, more promising drug, recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, was approved by the FDA in November 1987. Thrombolysis is now accepted therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction. Rapid identification of the patient with acute myocardial infarction plays an important role in treatment, because thrombolytic therapy is maximally effective if begun within four hours of the onset of symptoms. Care must be taken in selecting patients for treatment to ensure that an acute myocardial infarction is in evolution and that a medical condition predisposing to hemorrhage is not present. Cost of treatment and risk of complications must be considered before initiating therapy. In many patients, thrombolytic therapy can be considered only the first step in treatment, because of the relatively frequent occurrence of reocclusion and reinfarction after initial thrombolysis. If cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, and open heart surgery facilities are not readily available, transfer to a tertiary care center is indicated for high-risk patients, such as those with large anterior infarction, vacillating pain, or previous myocardial infarction. Transfer is safe if carried out promptly by critical care transport teams experienced in cardiac care.\r"

The use of tPA has been associated with improvement in left ventricular function, a lower mortality, and a decrease in congestive heart failure signs and symptoms. A protocol for evaluation of patients with possible myocardial infarction for thrombolytic therapy is presented. Consideration must be given to other possible diagnoses, and the ECG must be evaluated carefully to ensure that appropriate criteria are met. Risk factors for hemorrhagic complications include recent trauma, surgery, gastrointestinal and genitourinary bleeding, stroke, and focal neurologic findings. Greater benefit of therapy is expected in patients with larger infarcts who have more marked ST segment changes or evidence of hemodynamic compromise, especially when they are treated early after the onset of symptoms (within the first several hours). Adjunctive measures that can be considered in the emergency department include prophylactic lidocaine, IV nitroglycerin, beta blockade, aspirin, volume replacement and monitoring for dysrhythmias, bleeding, and recurrent ischemia. A comprehensive understanding of these rapidly evolving concepts will assist the emergency physician in the evaluation and management of patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Animal models of cerebral arterial occlusion have demonstrated that neurologic recovery is more likely the shorter the duration of occlusion. Complete recovery does not occur if the occlusion persists more than six hours. Prior trials have only rarely begun treatment within six hours of stroke onset. Over the past five years, we have participated in three stroke trials and have tried to identify factors that lead to delays in treatment. Factors that affect the time from stroke onset to arrival at the hospital include recognition of acute stroke by the patient, prehospital care personnel, and physicians. After arrival at the hospital, factors that can significantly delay treatment include the time to obtain computed tomography and the site of treatment (emergency department vs ICU). With proper attention, the time from patient arrival until treatment should be less than one hour. Future efforts should be directed toward reducing the time from stroke onset until arrival at the hospital. Education of the public, high-risk patients, prehospital care providers, and physicians may aid in these efforts.\r"

  ".W": "Significant current interest has focused on the possible value of fibrin-selective thrombolytic agents in acute stroke. Acute thrombosis contributes to carotid and vertebrobasilar arterial occlusions in the majority of acute stroke patients. Hence, fibrin(ogen)olytic agents may produce arterial recanalization and clinical benefit in thrombotic stroke. There are, however, unique features of cerebral tissue that suggest caution with the use of fibrin-selective agents in cerebral ischemia. The specific vascular anatomy and collateral flow suggest that salvage of the \"ischemic penumbra\" following vascular recanalization in focal ischemia is more likely to be successful than attempts in global ischemia. Recanalization may be associated with reperfusion injury and, more importantly, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. There is little concrete information regarding the relative contribution of either event to post-thrombolysis cerebral injury. Early studies with exogenous fibrinolytic agents (urokinase, streptokinase) in completed stroke were regarded as inconclusive, demonstrating only an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Subsequent pilot studies in carotid and in vertebrobasilar territory thrombotic stroke have demonstrated that recanalization can result when exogenous agents are infused just proximal to the cerebral artery occlusion by interventional neuroradiological techniques. This experience and the advent of fibrin-selective agents (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA] and single-chain urokinase plasminogen activator) have led to the development of a multicenter prospective safety/dose-ranging study of tPA in acute (less than eight hours from symptom onset) thrombotic stroke. Following initial clinical assessment, computed tomography scan, and angiography, each patient with a documented cerebral artery occlusion appropriate to the clinical syndrome receives a preassigned intravenous dose of tPA over 60 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Experimental studies of cerebral infarction suggest treatment may be most effective when begun within three hours and may be only marginally effective when begun after 12 hours. Lysis of an acute intra-arterial thrombus in the setting of thrombolytic therapy is also time dependent. We describe an ongoing dose-escalation study of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) as ultra-early therapy for cerebral infarction. The protocol requires that hemorrhage be ruled out by computed tomography scan of the brain prior to tPA infusion, and the infusion must begin within 90 minutes of symptom onset. The two primary goals of the study are to assess safety and potential efficacy. Preliminary results from the study and the future of ultra-early stroke intervention are discussed.\r"

The best results occur when the thrombus is lysed within 30 days; however, successful thrombolysis has occurred up to four months after an arterial occlusion. Thrombolysis allows dissolution of thrombus in the small distal runoff vessels, decreasing outflow resistance and enabling the native artery or bypass graft to remain open longer. When native arteries are lysed successfully, an underlying area of stenosis is usually identified and thus able to be corrected with either surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. When bypass grafts thrombose, thrombolytic agents are usually successful in lysing the thrombus and identifying the cause for the thrombosis. With local intra-arterial infusions, side effects and complications may be kept to a minimum.\r"

This probably represents an underestimate of incidence because massive acute pulmonary embolism may often result in rapid and therefore unexplained death in the absence of autopsy confirmation. The innovative and judicious use of thrombolytic agents by emergency department and paramedical ambulance personnel may lead to a decreased mortality for this disease. Clinical studies are necessary to determine if the cardiopulmonary compromise associated with massive pulmonary embolism can be rapidly reversed through thrombolysis and whether that reversal will lead to increased survival. The use of thrombolytic agents will gain favor only if their risk:benefit and cost:benefit ratios are acceptable. We discuss the results of using first- and second-generation thrombolytic agents in the treatment of pulmonary embolism and review the encouraging data that have emerged from our studies with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). This agent has relative fibrin specificity and may provide therapeutic advantages over the conventional thrombolytic agents, urokinase and streptokinase, particularly when the latter are administered in the currently recommended dose schedules for treatment of pulmonary embolism.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective review of a random sample of medical records to find evidence of the occurrence and active treatment of acute myocardial infarction during the admission. SETTING: Five tertiary teaching, five other teaching, and five nonteaching hospitals in metropolitan Boston. CASES: Random sample of hospital admissions assigned a discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction between October 1984 and September 1985. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 1003 cases reviewed, 260 did not meet the clinical criteria for acute myocardial infarction. At tertiary hospitals, 175 (41.7%) failed to qualify, compared with 25 (9.1%) at nonteaching facilities. In a large fraction of the disqualified cases, the patients had been admitted to exclude the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction; although explicitly \"ruled out,\" an acute myocardial infarction code was assigned. Sixty-six cases from teaching hospitals did not qualify because the patient had been admitted only for coronary angiography after an uneventful postmyocardial infarction course. Almost one-third of these patients had had their infarcts from 5 to 8 weeks before the angiography admission. CONCLUSIONS: Cases with an inappropriate discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction may be concentrated in teaching hospitals. This finding could have implications for Medicare's diagnosis-related group payment system and governmental and other research efforts that use these data for such purposes as drawing inferences about the quality of hospital care.\r"

Combinations of ampicillin with any of these agents failed to show bactericidal synergism. By filter-mating techniques, high-level gentamicin resistance could be transferred into a susceptible recipient of the same species at frequencies as high as 1 x 10(-4); transfer into Streptococcus faecalis JH2-7 occurred at lower frequencies (less than 2 x 10(-7). Aminoglycoside substrate profile analysis of clinical isolates as well as of laboratory-derived cured strains and transconjugants revealed 2\"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (III) phosphorylating enzymes, AAC-6' acetylating activity above that attributable to the intrinsic activity characteristic of S. faecium, and a streptomycin adenylylating enzyme. All three isolates carried a 51-megadalton plasmid. Curing of this plasmid or conjugative transfer into susceptible recipients was associated with the loss or acquisition of high-level gentamicin resistance, respectively. Loss of high-level gentamicin resistance was also observed when curing techniques resulted in a decrease in the size of this plasmid equivalent to a 10-megadalton deletion. Transferable, high-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides, which was previously recognized in S. faecalis, has now emerged in clinical isolates of S. faecium, with the attendant concerns for possible spread.\r"

Ultrastructural observations of rod and filamentous forms of P. aeruginosa and their interaction with polymorphonuclear leukocytes are presented. Growth of P. aeruginosa 1348A in the presence of 4 micrograms of moxalactam per ml (one-fourth the MIC) resulted in filamentous forms. Phagocytosis of 75Se-radiolabeled filaments was more efficient than that of rods during the first 20 min of the assay; subsequently, phagocytosis of both forms was equal. The polymorphonuclear leukocyte bactericidal activities against both forms, which were standardized to equal bacterial particle and viable-cell counts, were equivalent. Considering the greater size and mass of filaments compared with those of rods, we concluded that filaments are more susceptible to both phagocytosis and killing than are bacillary forms.\r"

Mycobacterial growth was monitored by the radiometric method (BACTEC system; Johnston Laboratories, Inc., Towson, Md.). We observed a predictable eightfold difference between the MICs determined at pH 5.5 and those determined at pH 5.95. The highest MICs for 21 susceptible strains were 50.0 micrograms/ml at pH 5.5 and 400 micrograms/ml at pH 5.95. This eightfold difference enabled us to predict MICs at pH 5.5 from the values observed at pH 5.95. The use of 7H12 broth at pH 5.95 simplified the radiometric PZA susceptibility test by avoiding the addition of acid solutions in the course of cultivation, which was required when the test was performed at pH 5.5. An additional benefit of using pH 5.95 instead of pH 5.5 was that all tested strains grew at pH 5.95, while some of them, especially PZA-resistant strains, did not grow at pH 5.5.\r"

Penicillin biosynthesis was greatly reduced (55%) in D-glucose-grown cultures of the parental strain, but this sugar had no repressive effect on the rate of penicillin biosynthesis in the mutant glk1. This mutant was deficient in ATP-dependent glucokinase and showed a greatly reduced uptake of D-glucose. The parental strain P. chrysogenum AS-P-78 showed in vitro ATP-dependent phosphorylating activities of D-glucose, D-2-deoxyglucose, and D-galactose. The glk1 mutant was deficient in the in vitro phosphorylation of D-glucose and D-2-deoxyglucose but retained a normal D-galactose-phosphorylating activity. D-Glucose repressed both beta-galactosidase and isopenicillin-N-synthase but not acyl coenzyme A:6-aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase in the parental strain. The glucokinase-deficient mutant was simultaneously derepressed in carbon catabolite regulation of beta-galactosidase and isopenicillin-N-synthase, suggesting that a common regulatory mechanism is involved in carbon catabolite regulation of both sugar utilization and penicillin biosynthesis.\r"

We have identified a new locus, mom (for modifier of Mtr), which is located on the chromosome very close to penB and nmp, loci known to be linked to each other and to spc. Phenotypic suppression of Mtr was recognized by reductions of resistance to benzylpenicillin and also to oxacillin and the hydrophobic agents novobiocin and erythromycin. The resistance to each of these antibiotics returned to the Mtr levels in mom+ transformants isolated by selection for increased resistance to either novobiocin or erythromycin; the accompanying change of the outer membrane protein I seroreactions confirmed the proximity of nmp and mom. Thus, some mutant gonococci display wild-type antibiotic susceptibilities but can express multiple resistance following a mom+ mutation that releases the suppressed Mtr phenotype.\r"

Some rabbits were treated by use of an eye cup with no current as a control for iontophoresis, and others were treated with fortified drops (1.36%) delivered topically for comparison with results of earlier studies. One hour after treatment with tobramycin, the concentration of drug in the infected corneas was compared with that achieved in mock-infected and uninfected eyes. Iontophoresis of 25 mg of tobramycin per ml at 0.8 mA for 10 min delivered significantly more drug (P = 0.0001) to corneal tissue than did drops or use of an eye cup without current in P. aeruginosa-infected eyes mock-infected eyes, or uninfected eyes. Tobramycin concentrations in the infected corneas (605.9 micrograms/g) were not significantly different (P = 0.815) from the concentrations in mock-infected eyes (641.4 micrograms/g), but were lower (P = 0.007) than those obtained by iontophoresis in uninfected corneas (853.6 micrograms/g). Use of an eye cup without current delivered tobramycin equally to infected, mock-infected, and normal eyes, i.e., 176.5, 171.0, and 163.1 micrograms/g, respectively (P greater than 0.709). Tobramycin delivered by use of fortified drops delivered topically was detectable in mock-infected corneas (20 micrograms/g) and P. aeruginosa-infected corneas (6.0 micrograms/g). These results suggest that iontophoresis has value as an ocular drug delivery system and that an eye cup could also be useful in a therapeutic regimen for ocular infections.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibition of the proliferation of Ehrlichia risticii cultured in murine macrophage P388D1 cells by eight antibiotics was evaluated by indirect fluorescent-antibody staining with an antiserum specific to E. risticii. There was a negative correlation between the percentage of infected cells and the log10 of the concentrations of all antibiotics examined. The ranks of the antibiotics in the order of 50% inhibitory concentrations (on a microgram-per-milliliter basis) after 48 h of exposure were as follows: demeclocycline, doxycycline, and oxytetracycline less than minocycline less than rifampin less than tetracycline less than erythromycin and nalidixic acid. When the antibiotics were removed after 48 h of incubation, continuous inhibition of proliferation was evident at 72 h. At 96 h regrowth of the organisms occurred in most of the cultures. The rate of regrowth was the highest with nalidixic acid, followed by erythromycin, at all concentrations of the antibiotic tested. Regrowth was observed with less than 0.1 microgram of minocycline per ml and less than 0.01 microgram of oxytetracycline, tetracycline, and doxycycline per ml. With more than 0.01 microgram of demeclocycline per ml, however, the inhibition persisted for up to 72 h after removal of the antibiotic. These results indicate that demeclocycline was slightly more effective than doxycycline, oxytetracycline, and minocycline in eliminating E. risticii in macrophages in vitro, whereas tetracycline and rifampin were less effective. Nalidixic acid and erythromycin were ineffective.\r"

The broth-determined MICs of all drugs with the exception of isoniazid were two to eight times lower than the agar-determined MICs for most of the tested M. avium strains, which is probably due to the higher absorption and degradation of the drugs in solid media. The MICs, especially those determined in broth, are suggested as quantitative measurements of the degree of susceptibility of M. avium complex strains. For a certain percentage of the M. avium strains the broth-determined MICs were within the limits of MICs found for wild susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. These M. avium strains were classified as presumably susceptible. In contrast to M. tuberculosis, the MICs for M. avium strains had a wide range. When the MICs for M. avium strains were only one dilution higher than those for M. tuberculosis, they were tentatively classified as moderately susceptible. The designation moderately resistant or resistant, respectively, is suggested for those M. avium strains for which the MICs were at or above the concentrations achievable in blood. The quantitation of the degree of susceptibility by the MICs and the tentative interpretation of the MICs are suggested for future use in clinical trials as a means of evaluating the patients' responses to chemotherapy compared with the degree of susceptibility of the initial strain isolated before treatment.\r"

Eflornithine (DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine [DFMO]; Ornidyl; Merrell Dow Research Institute, Cincinnati, Ohio) has been used successfully against this protozoan disease in limited clinical trials, although not all patients respond to therapy. In contrast, results of the only reported experiments with DFMO in an animal model were negative. We retested DFMO against P. carinii in an immunosuppressed rat model by inclusion of 3% DFMO in the drinking water, a dose rate about twice that used previously. A combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, a proven anti-P. carinii agent, was used as a positive control. After 3 weeks of anti-P. carinii pneumonia therapy, the surviving rats were sacrificed and the degree of parasitosis was judged by examination of lung sections stained with silver methenamine to reveal cysts. In three separate experiments, DFMO showed definite anti-P. carinii pneumonia activity; the parasitosis of DFMO-treated animals was significantly less than that of control animals (P less than 0.001 for all experiments). DFMO was not as active as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, however. Several other experimental therapies were tested, including dapsone and two additional antiprotozoal agents: suramin and diminazene aceturate (Berenil; Farbwerke Hoechst, Frankfurt, Federal Republic of Germany). Diminazene aceturate, a veterinary drug related to the standard anti-P. carinii pneumonia agent pentamidine, was very active (P less than 10(-10]. Suramin and dapsone were weakly active. The combinations suramin-diminazene aceturate and suramin-DFMO were tested, but they were antagonistic rather than synergistic.\r"

Thus, 2.4 mg of nanoparticle-bound ampicillin (three doses of 0.8 mg each) had a greater therapeutic effect than 48 mg of free ampicillin (three doses of 16 mg each).

A suppression of ATP, indicating growth inhibition, occurred for susceptible but not resistant strains within 5 to 7 days of incubation. Breakpoint concentrations between susceptibility and resistance were determined by comparing these results with those obtained by reference techniques. Full agreement was found in 99% of the assays with the resistance ratio method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium, and 98% of the assays were in full agreement with the radiometric system (BACTEC). A main advantage of the bioluminescence method is its rapidity, with results available as fast as with the radiometric system but at a lower cost and without the need for radioactive culture medium. The method provides kinetic data concerning drug effects within available in vivo drug concentrations and has great potential for both rapid routine susceptibility testing and research applications in studies of drug effects on mycobacteria.\r"

Although inactive against wild-type Escherichia coli, DuP 721 did inhibit E. coli when the outer membrane was perturbed by genetic or chemical means. Pulse-labeling studies with E. coli PLB-3252, a membrane-defective strain, showed that DuP 721 inhibited amino acid incorporation into proteins. The 50% inhibitory concentration of DuP 721 for protein synthesis was 3.8 micrograms/ml, but it was greater than 64 micrograms/ml for RNA and DNA syntheses. The direct addition of DuP 721 to cell-free systems did not inhibit any of the reactions of protein synthesis from chain initiation through chain elongation with either synthetic or natural mRNA as template. However, cell extracts prepared from DuP 721 growth-arrested cells were defective in initiation-dependent polypeptide synthesis directed by MS2 bacteriophage RNA. These cell-free extracts were not defective in polypeptide elongation or in fMet-tRNA(fMet)-dependent polypeptide synthesis stimulated by poly(G.U). We conclude, therefore, that DuP 721 exerts its primary action at a step preceding the interaction of fMet-tRNA(fMet) and 30S ribosomal subunits with the initiator codon.\r"

The median bactericidal titers produced in plasma against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly higher with erythromycin estolate than with the ethylsuccinate ester at both 2 and 8 h after dosing (P less than 0.05 by Student's t test). Both erythromycin esters showed rather weak bactericidal activity against Branhamella catarrhalis; a further look at these results indicated that erythromycin estolate presented 50% of the plasma samples at 2 h with bactericidal titers superior or equal to 1:8, versus 11% for the ethylsuccinate ester. Of the 60 plasma bactericidal activity tests performed against Staphylococcus aureus, only 6 (10%) and 3 (5%) exhibited titers of 1:8 or greater for erythromycin estolate and erythromycin ethylsuccinate, respectively.

PD 127,391 was less active at pH 5, its maximal activity being at pH 7 to 8. The presence of urine at pH 5.9 decreased the bactericidal activity. The protein binding of PD 127,391 was 2 to 7%, and serum had little effect on activity.\r"

Despite a marked increase in the use of 4-quinolones, there was no increase in the percentages of nalidixic acid-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae between 1975 and 1986. However, different bacterial species showed considerable variation, and there were also considerable differences in the percentages of nalidixic acid-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae from different centers. The frequency of resistance to fluoroquinolones was unchanged from 1983 to 1986 and was less than 4% in all species except P. aeruginosa. In this species, there was an increase from about 3 to 10% from 1983 to 1986 for strains for which the MIC was fourfold above the mode MIC of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and ofloxacin.\r"

Heart-lung transplantation was carried out in 11 cynomolgus monkeys. Donor cardiac preservation was achieved with cold crystalloid cardioplegic solution (10 ml per kilogram of body weight) in all animals. Lung preservation was achieved with a rollerhead pump and by cooling (12 degrees C) the donor in one group of 4 animals (deep hypothermia group) and infusing cold (4 degrees C) modified Euro-Collins solution (15 ml/kg X 4 minutes) into the main pulmonary artery of 7 donors pretreated with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) (PGE1 group). PGE1 was given intravenously (0.5 to 4.0 micrograms/kg/min) beginning 15 minutes prior to aortic cross-clamping and was continued during administration of the pulmonary cooling solution. In the deep hypothermia group, no pharmacotherapy was used. Grafts were stored at 4 degrees C for about 6 hours. After heart-lung transplantation, arterial blood gases were measured on 40% inspired oxygen and 2 to 3 cm of positive end-expiratory pressure, and were significantly higher in the PGE1 group than the deep hypothermia group after 8 hours of reperfusion (p = 0.04). The partial pressure of arterial oxygen decreased significantly during the 8 hours of reperfusion in the deep hypothermia group (153 to 108 mm Hg; p = 0.01) and increased in the PGE1 group (189 to 218 mm Hg;p = 0.0002). Eighty-six percent of the animals in the PGE1 group survived more than 24 hours (p = 0.03). There were no survivors in the deep hypothermia group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Estimates of the likelihood and the cost of various outcomes were obtained from a panel of experts using the Delphi group opinion technique. Treatment with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for three days was compared with daily prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim or doxycycline. The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis with either agent (75% to 83%) was greater than that of treatment (38%). Treatment would become more cost-effective than prophylaxis when the cumulative risk of acquiring travelers' diarrhea was less than 0.05 episodes per person per week or if the effectiveness of prophylaxis fell below 35% for doxycycline and 46% for sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. The most important contributor to the mean cost of travelers' diarrhea in this analysis was the cost associated with a day of incapacitation due to illness. On the basis of the results of this decision analysis, we conclude that prophylaxis of travelers' diarrhea is an option that should be considered for individual situations and recommend further studies of its cost-effectiveness.\r"

The hazards of red blood cell alloimmunization and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) complicate the treatment of patients with sickle cell diseases, particularly since such reactions may be misinterpreted as a pain crisis, and, as a result, specific transfusion serologic studies may not be performed. The frequency of alloimmunization in this population has been the subject of several reports; however, the frequency of DHTRs is unknown. To determine the frequency of this event, we retrospectively reviewed the medical and transfusion service records of all adult patients with sickle cell diseases transfused during the six-year period from January 1980 to December 1985. Seventy-three adult patients with sickle cell diseases received transfusions. The prevalence of recognized DHTR was three (4%) of 73. Red blood cell alloimmunization was seen in 22 (30%) of 73 of the patients. The calculated risk of alloimmunization was 3.1% per unit of blood. These observations suggest that alloimmunization and clinically apparent DHTRs occur more frequently in patients with sickle cell diseases and support pretransfusion testing for at least Rh and Kell red blood cell antigens in patients who are at high risk of such events (patients who have formed an alloantibody or who are being enrolled in a transfusion program).\r"

Pneumocystis carinii was diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage in 13 of the 30 patients; two of these patients had P carinii organisms identified in sputum specimens (sensitivity of sputum, 15.3%; negative predictive value, 60.7%). A cost-analysis study demonstrated that sputum examination is not cost effective when the sensitivity is below 24%. We conclude that P carinii can be diagnosed from expectorated sputum in patients with AIDS, but, because of the test's low sensitivity, it cannot be recommended in the routine evaluation of patients with AIDS and pulmonary complaints.\r"

Positional changes (particularly standing) resulted in reassessing of normal supine bladder responses as hyperreflexic. Hyperreflexia was aggravated with sitting and standing. Positional changes did not demonstrate conversion of areflexia to hyperreflexia. The relatively small proportion of dyssynergic sphincter responses probably represents a population of patients with early stage multiple sclerosis. Carbon dioxide cystometry, with positional changes, is relatively safe, easily performed, and an accurate method of evaluating detrusor response in patients with multiple sclerosis who have a changing clinical course or unresponsiveness to treatment.\r"

New heparinoid substances, lacking the hazards of more established anticoagulants, raise the question of DVT prophylaxis for these patients. Two hundred fifty consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients were evaluated for the presence of DVT of the legs in a feasibility study for a trial of low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis. Forty-nine patients were found suitable for the study, of whom 11 (22.5%) developed DVT. All patients underwent clinical examination, I-125 fibrinogen leg scanning, and impedance plethysmography. Five patients were sufficiently alert and without serious neurologic deficits to justify DVT prophylaxis. Recent advances in noninvasive diagnostic techniques to detect DVT early and the development of relatively safe heparinoid compounds increase the need for a prophylactic study in patients with ischemic stroke.\r"

To clarify the role of TNF in PMN activation, neutrophil responsiveness after in vitro treatment with TNF was examined. Neutrophils from seven normal subjects were incubated with TNF for 30 minutes and tested for chemotaxis to leukotriene B4, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and zymosan-activated serum, or the calcium ionophore A23187 to assess leukotriene B4 generation. A range of 10(-13) to 10(-9) mol/L of TNF was used for these assays. When 10(-9) mol/L of TNF was used, the amount of leukotriene B4 that was produced was significantly greater than in control cells. The effect of TNF on PMN chemotaxis was uniformly inhibitory for the three stimuli at 10(-10) mol/L compared with untreated cells. At a picomolar range, PMN migration to leukotriene B4, but not to zymosan-activated serum or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, was significantly increased over that of PMNs not exposed to TNF. This suggests that TNF has a specific facilitatory effect on PMN responsiveness for both leukotriene B4 production and chemotaxis to leukotriene B4 and may be the same signal for this phenomenon in endotoxemic patients.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effects of endotoxin on gut barrier function, we performed paired studies of intestinal permeability in healthy humans (N = 12) receiving intravenous Escherichia coli endotoxin (4 ng/kg) or 0.9% saline solution. Two nonmetabolizable sugars, lactulose and mannitol, which are standard permeability markers, were administered orally, 30 minutes before and 120 minutes after the test injection. The 12-hour urinary excretion of these substances after endotoxin/saline solution administration was used to quantitate intestinal permeability. After endotoxin administration systemic absorption and excretion of lactulose increased almost two-fold (mean +/- SEM, 263 +/- 36 mumol per 12 hours vs 145 +/- 19 mumol per 12 hours during saline studies). Similar but less marked alterations in mannitol absorption and excretion occurred after endotoxin injection (5.7 +/- 0.3 mmol per 12 hours vs 4.9 +/- 0.3 mmol per 12 hours). When individual 12-hour lactulose excretion after endotoxin administration was related to the magnitude of systemic responses, a significant relationship occurred between lactulose excretion and elaboration of norepinephrine and between lactulose excretion and minimum white blood cell count. These data suggest that a brief exposure to circulating endotoxin increases the permeability of the normal gut. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that during critical illness, prolonged or repeated exposure to systemic endotoxins or associated cytokines may significantly compromise the integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier.\r"

Gavage with either Pseudomonas or Candida resulted in significant suppression of DTH responses, while gavage with S epidermidis produced modest enhancement of DTH. Animals given Pseudomonas demonstrated impaired ability to localize a subcutaneous Staphylococcus aureus challenge and decreased IgM but enhanced anti-Pseudomonas IgA and IgG responses after intraperitoneal immunization. Pulmonary bacterial clearance at seven days was normal. These findings suggest that gut colonization with Candida or Pseudomonas may contribute to impairment of cell-mediated immunity in the critically ill patient.\r"

Higher concentrations of fleroxacin were recorded in pus than in serum at each time point up to eight hours after administration, but pus levels of ciprofloxacin only exceeded serum levels after 1.5 hours.

Bacterial killing was quantitated by culturing corneal homogenates and calculating the number of viable bacteria (colony-forming units) per cornea. Corneas receiving shields rehydrated in 4% tobramycin and applied for four hours demonstrated significantly reduced numbers of bacteria compared with untreated control corneas. The collagen shields were as effective in reducing the number of viable bacteria per cornea as 4% tobramycin drops applied every 30 minutes over a four-hour period. Over a nine-hour treatment period, the addition of four drops of 4% tobramycin to shields in situ was as effective as exchange with a new shield rehydrated in 4% tobramycin. These results suggest that collagen shields rehydrated in a water-soluble antibiotic such as tobramycin may be an effective and convenient mode of therapy for Pseudomonas keratitis.\r"

The ability of these compounds to alter the severity of arthritic lesions and to reduce serum levels of the acute-phase reactant, serum amyloid P component (SAP) were monitored. Serum concentrations of SAP were found to correlate strongly (r = 0.985) with disease severity at day 35 postimmunization. Treatment with SK&F 86002, SK&F 104351, phenidone, or dexamethasone significantly reduced disease severity, as judged by clinical score (55%, 72%, 41%, and 45% inhibition, respectively) and SAP levels (62%, 94%, 52%, and 94% inhibition, respectively) in arthritic mice. This profile of activity was not shared by the selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors, which did not uniformly inhibit disease activity by both parameters. The results suggest that dual inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase may prove more effective than selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors as anti-arthritic agents.\r"

Treatment of the cells with dibutyryl cAMP or prostaglandin E2 enhanced both spontaneous and rIL-1 beta-induced 3H-AA release; treatment with indomethacin or naproxen inhibited the response. The effects of these cyclooxygenase inhibitors on 3H-AA release were not reversed by the addition of prostaglandin E2. The activities of phospholipase A, phospholipase C, and diglyceride lipase were detected in the homogenates of rat synovial fibroblasts. Pretreatment of synovial cells with rIL-1 beta resulted in a threefold stimulation of phospholipase A activity and a slight increase in phospholipase C activity in cell homogenates. These data show that rIL-1 beta stimulates phospholipase activities in rat synovial fibroblasts and that at least one of these activities may be regulated by either prostaglandins or cAMP.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone of cardiac origin, released in response to atrial distention, that increases sodium excretion, inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system, and decreases arterial pressure. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by chronic atrial distention, sodium retention with edema, and activation of the RAA system. The role of ANF in the pathophysiology of CHF remains to be defined. Circulating ANF is greatly increased in congestive heart failure. The mechanism of this elevation of ANF is explained by increased synthesis and release of ANF from the atria with atrial depletion of ANF in response to chronic atrial overload. Recent work also suggests the presence of ANF in ventricular myocardium in heart failure in which the ventricle is recruited to synthesize and release this peptide hormone. Despite increased circulating ANF in heart failure, the kidney retains sodium and is hyporesponsive to exogenous administration of ANF. The mechanism of this hyporesponsiveness is multifactorial but may be explained in part by activation of the intrarenal RAA system as well as by a reduction in renal perfusion pressure. A therapeutic role for ANF remains unclear. To date, studies conflict, but some investigations of ANF infusions in man support a unique and selective renal vasodilator action in association with an ability to inhibit the RAA system.\r"

We reviewed our recent experience involving hemophiliacs undergoing a variety of otolaryngologic surgical procedures. A protocol was developed to minimize the risks of hemorrhage through the judicious use of preoperative and post-operative coagulation replacement products. Modern hemostatic techniques, such as the use of the surgical laser, also had a role in lessening the incidence of bleeding problems. The relative risks of the various hemostatic products with regard to the transmission of communicable diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatitis were evaluated. Recent data suggest that heat treatment of factors VIII and IX concentrates eliminates the risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome transmission, and these heated concentrates should be used in preference to older products. Hepatitis remains a problem, but this risk may be reduced to some degree through immunization with hepatitis B vaccines that have recently been proved safe and effective.\r"

In 13 developing human hearts (7-24 weeks' gestation) the immunoreactivity was concentrated in the atrial myocardium and ventricular conduction system but it was also detected in the early fetal ventricular myocardium. Immunoreactivity in five normal adults was largely confined to the atrial myocardium although it was also found in the ventricular conduction tissues of hearts removed from 10 patients who were undergoing cardiac transplantation. The ventricular conduction system is an extra-atrial site for the synthesis of atrial natriuretic peptide. In the failing heart this synthesis may be further supplemented by expression of the gene in the ventricular myocardium. It is possible that ventricular production of the peptide contributes to the raised circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide immunoreactivity found in severe congestive heart disease, particularly in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

Measurements were made with inspired oxygen concentrations varying from 40% to 10%. sGlaw tended to be slightly reduced (indicating bronchoconstriction) by decreasing the oxygen concentration from 40% to 15%, these changes being statistically significant after the administration of atropine. ERV was unaffected by changes in oxygen concentration from 40% to 15%, but was significantly reduced during ventilation with 10% oxygen. This effect was reversed by re-oxygenation and was not abolished by prior administration of atropine. It was concluded that both bronchoconstriction and changes in lung volume may be responsible for changes in airway resistance during hypoxia.\r"

  ".W": "The pulmonary kinetics of fentanyl and alfentanil were studied quantitatively in two groups of five and six surgical patients, respectively, after the induction of anaesthesia. A mixture of one of the opioids and indocyanine green was administered as a bolus. From measurements of the concentrations of the dye in plasma and the opioids in blood, central blood volume and the amount of drug which passed through the pulmonary circulation were calculated. The pulmonary release of fentanyl and alfentanil was calculated from the arterial-mixed venous blood concentration differences. Fentanyl 43.0-86.9% (median 70.9%) and 35.9-79.8% of alfentanil (median 58.6%) were sequestered by the lung on first passage of the opioid-containing blood through the pulmonary capillaries. During the following 14 min, fentanyl was released, apparently from two binding sites (T1/2fast: 0.22 (0.16-0.27) min; T1/2slow: 5.78 (3.65-13.86) min). Initially, there was a rapid release of alfentanil (T1/2: 0.28 (0.08-0.51) min). However, 1-3 min after injection, the arterial-mixed venous blood concentration differences of alfentanil disappeared, although considerable amounts of drug were still present in the lung of five of the six patients studied. It may be expected that a temporary pulmonary sequestration of fentanyl and alfentanil has considerable impact on the time course of their pharmacological effects, on the time necessary to reach their maximum effect and on the intensity and (in case of fentanyl) the duration of these effects.\r"

Plasma concentration of alfentanil, somatic and haemodynamic responses were measured at loss of consciousness, tracheal intubation, sternotomy and during multiple application of electrocoagulation. Additional alfentanil was administered i.v. to control unwanted responses. Study 1 (six patients): lorazepam 0.08 mg kg-1 by mouth 1-2 h before operation, alfentanil priming infusion (60 micrograms kg-1 min-1 for 10 min) followed by maintenance infusion (4.5 micrograms kg-1 min-1). With mean plasma alfentanil 1178 (SEM 54) ng ml-1, two patients required supplementary alfentanil to suppress somatic motor responses; one patients required nitroglycerin to control an increase in arterial pressure which was unresponsive to additional alfentanil following sternotomy. Study 2 (13 patients): lorazepam 0.04 mg kg-1 by mouth as premedication; one of three maintenance infusion rates of alfentanil: 5.4 (n = 4), 6.6 (n = 5), or 7.8 (n = 4) micrograms kg-1 min-1, each preceded by a proportional priming infusion. With plasma alfentanil 2181 (62) ng ml-1, somatic motor responses requiring additional alfentanil occurred in nine patients; haemodynamic responses in four of seven patients tested could not be controlled by alfentanil. The highest plasma concentration of alfentanil to prevent response to a stimulus other than tracheal intubation was different between the two studies (P less than 0.05). We conclude that alfentanil alone is insufficient to suppress haemodynamic and somatic motor responses to noxious stimulation during CABG and that the role of premedication is significant.\r"

Ten healthy volunteers were given 120 mg of terfenadine or placebo in a double-blind randomized two-period cross-over study. Twenty micrograms of histamine were then injected intradermally at 12, 18, and 24 h. The thickness of the resulting weal was measured by an A-scan pulsed ultrasound device. The area and perimeter of the resulting weal and flare were measured by tracing onto acetate sheets and using a digitizing tablet linked to a microcomputer. Just before each dose of histamine was injected, blood was taken to measure the level of the major metabolite of terfenadine. There was a significant difference between terfenadine 120 mg and placebo in the area and perimeter of the weal and the area and perimeter of the weal and flare at 12, 18 and 24 h, but no significant difference in weal thickness. Thus, terfenadine suppresses the wealing response caused by intradermally injected histamine over a 24 h period. It may be possible, therefore, to use a once daily dose of terfenadine.\r"

  ".U": "89051289\r", 
  ".W": "A total of 22,552 workers employed by the Atomic Weapons Establishment between 1951 and 1982 were followed up for an average of 18.6 years. Of the 3115 who died, 865 (28%) died of cancer. Mortality was 23% lower than the national average for all causes of death and 18% lower for cancer. These low rates were consistent with the findings in other workforces in the nuclear industry and reflect, at least in part, the selection of healthy people to work in the industry and the disproportionate recruitment of people from the higher social classes. At some time during their employment 9389 (42%) of the workers were monitored for exposure to radiation, the average cumulative whole body exposure to external radiation being 7.8 mSv. Their mortality was generally similar to that of other employees, even when exposures were lagged by 10 years. The rate ratio after a 10 year lag in workers with a radiation record compared with other workers was 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.10) for all causes of death and 1.06 (0.89 to 1.27) for all malignant neoplasms. The only significant differences were for prostatic cancer (rate ratio 2.23; 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 4.40) and for cancers of ill defined and secondary sites (rate ratio 2.37; 1.23 to 4.56). Cancers of lymphatic and haemopoietic tissues were notable for their low occurrence in the study population, with only four deaths from leukaemia and two from multiple myeloma in workers with a radiation record, 9.16 and 3.55 deaths respectively being expected on the basis of national rates. Among workers who had a radiation record 3742 (40%) were also monitored for possible internal exposure to plutonium, 3044 (32%) to uranium, 1562 (17%) to tritium, 638 (7%) to polonium, and 281 (3%) to actinium. In these workers mortality from malignant neoplasms as a whole was not increased, but after a 10 year lag death rates from prostatic and renal cancers were generally more than twice the national average, these excesses arising in a small group of workers monitored for exposure to multiple radionuclides. Though mortality from lung cancer in workers monitored for exposure to plutonium was below the national average, it was some two thirds higher than in other radiation workers, the excess being of borderline statistical significance. Mortality from malignant neoplasms as a whole showed a weak and non-significant increasing trend with increasing level of cumulative whole body exposure to external radiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A total of 8716 samples of serum collected by five public health laboratories in different parts of England during 1986-7 were tested. Despite the current measles vaccination programme 60% of children aged 1-2 years did not have measles antibody and over 80% did not have antibodies to mumps and rubella. In the 3-4 year age group 17% of the children were susceptible to measles, 55% to mumps, and 73% to rubella. The results suggest that vaccinating children early in the second year of life will be necessary to eliminate the three diseases. The survey provides baseline data for continuing surveillance of the immediate and long term effects of the new vaccination strategy.\r"

Three groups of adult patients were identified: patients with a psychiatric disorder and a new prescription for a psychotropic drug; patients with a psychiatric disorder but no new prescription for a psychotropic drug; and a control group without psychiatric disorder. The percentages of patients having one or more consultation for physical illnesses were stable over the years studied, being roughly 90%, 85%, and 60% respectively. For groups identified in 1972 their patterns of consultation for physical illness were examined in 1957, 1962, and annually from 1967 to 1976. In every year studied except 1957 the group with a psychiatric disorder and a new prescription for a psychotropic drug exceeded both other groups in the percentage of patients having one or more consultations for physical illnesses. Both groups with psychiatric disorders had an excess of consultations over the control group; this excess halved in about four years for the group with a new prescription and in about one year for the group without a new prescription. Mental health care by general practitioners for patients with psychiatric disorders does not seem to have an offset effect on general health care of these patients.\r"

The total group was drawn from all specialties in the hospital, and by interviewing the patients, their carers, the ward sisters, and the patients' general practitioners the factors causing early unplanned readmission for each patient were identified. Seven possible principal reasons were found: relapse of original condition, development of a new problem, carer problems, complications of the initial illness, need for terminal care, problems with medication, and problems with services. There were also contributory reasons, and it was usual for several of these to be present in each case. The unplanned readmission rate was 6%; the planned readmission rate was 3%. It was thought that unplanned readmission was avoidable for 78 (59%) patients. Patients in the study group and in the control group showed significant differences in certain characteristics--such as low income, previous hospital admission, already having nursing care, and admission by general practitioners--and this might help to identify patients who are likely to be readmitted in an emergency.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE--To determine whether mortality from breast cancer could be reduced by repeated mammographic screening. DESIGN--Birth year cohorts of city population separately randomised into study and control groups. SETTING--Screening clinic outside main hospital. PATIENTS--Women aged over 45; 21,088 invited for screening and 21,195 in control group. INTERVENTIONS--Women in the study group were invited to attend for mammographic screening at intervals of 18-24 months. Five rounds of screening were completed. Breast cancer was treated according to stage at diagnosis. END POINT--Mortality from breast cancer. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--All women were followed up and classed at end point as alive without breast cancer, alive with breast cancer, dead from breast cancer, or dead from other causes. Cause of death was taken from national mortality registry and for patients with breast cancer was validated independently. Mean follow up was 8.8 years. Altogether 588 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the study group and 447 in the control group; 99 v 94 women died of all causes and 63 v 66 women died of breast cancer (no significant difference; relative risk 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.35)). In the study group 29% more women aged less than 55 died of breast cancer (28 v 22; relative risk 1.29 (0.74 to 2.25)). More women in the study group died from breast cancer in the first seven years; after that the trend reversed, especially in women aged greater than or equal to 55 at entry. Overall, women in the study group aged greater than or equal to 55 had a 20% reduction in mortality from breast cancer (35 v 44; relative risk 0.79 (0.51 to 1.24)). OTHER FINDINGS--In the study group 100 (17%) cancers appeared in intervals between screenings and 107 (18%) in non-attenders; 51 of these women died from breast cancer. Cancers classed as stages II-IV comprised 33% (190/579) of cancers in the study group and 52% (231/443) in the control group. CONCLUSIONS--Invitation to mammographic screening may lead to reduced mortality from breast cancer, at least in women aged 55 or over.\r"

After the first seizure a second attack had occurred within one month in 56 patients, within three months in 93, and within one year in 159. The median interval between the first two seizures was 12 weeks (95% confidence interval 10 to 18 weeks), between the second and third eight weeks (four to 12 weeks), between the third and fourth four weeks (two to 20 weeks), and between the fourth and fifth three weeks (one to four weeks). When patients who had had three, four, or five untreated seizures were considered separately a similar pattern of decreasing intervals was seen. Successive intervals between seizures could be compared in 82 patients. In 48 the interval decreased, in 16 it did not change, and in 18 it increased. These results suggest that in many patients there is an accelerating disease process in the early stages of epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "Alcohol consumption and drinking habits among Finnish doctors were studied as part of a survey of stress and burnout. A questionnaire containing 99 questions or groups of questions was sent to all 3496 practising doctors aged under 66 randomly selected from the registry of the Finnish Medical Association. Altogether 2671 doctors (76%) responded; this sample was representative of the Finnish medical profession. The average weekly consumption of alcohol during the past year and various aspects of drinking behaviour were assessed, and the presence or absence of symptoms and diseases often encountered among heavy drinkers and addicts was determined. The data were analysed separately for men and women, for those aged less than or equal to 40 and greater than 40, and for the men with high and low alcohol consumption and with high and low scores on the index of drinking habits. Selected variables related to work, stress, and coping were correlated with alcohol consumption and drinking behaviour. The median consumption of alcohol among male doctors was 4876 g (6.2 litres) and among female doctors 2226 g (2.8 litres) of absolute alcohol per person per year and was higher in those aged over 40. Beer was most commonly drunk by men and wine by women. Increased alcohol consumption was associated with older age, disappointment with career, heavy smoking, use of benzodiazepines, stress and burnout symptoms, suicidal thoughts, general dissatisfaction, and diseases related to alcohol. Drinking habits were heavier among doctors working in community health centres, those taking long sick leaves, younger doctors disappointed with their careers or the atmosphere at work, and older doctors immersed in their work. Alcohol consumption among doctors seems to be higher than that of the general population in Finland, and heavy drinking seems to be associated with stress and burnout.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which atherosclerotic disease is induced by cigarette smoking has not yet been identified unequivocally. Chronic cigarette smoking and the generation of vasoactive prostanoids and the size of carotid atherosclerotic plaques were studied in nine pairs of identical male twins discordant for smoking for over 20 years. The urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 (thromboxane B2 metabolite) of the smoking twin was significantly higher (on average 1.8 times higher) in every pair and that of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (prostacyclin metabolite) was significantly higher (on average 1.3 times higher) in eight of the nine pairs. The ratio of excretion of these metabolites was significantly higher, being 4.0 (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 5.4) among the smokers compared with 2.9 (2.1 to 3.8) among the non-smokers, thus favouring a mechanism of vasoconstriction. Excretion of the thromboxane B2 metabolite was related to the urinary concentrations of nicotine metabolites. Atherosclerotic plaques detected by ultrasonography in the carotid arteries were significantly larger among smokers but did not correlate with the urinary excretion of prostacyclin and thromboxane B2 metabolites or intensity of smoking. Smoking was concluded to induce activation of platelets by an effect mediated by nicotine. The increased prostacyclin production, on the other hand, suggested a compensatory mechanism for the general vasoconstrictive properties of cigarette smoking.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised assignment of groups of diabetic volunteers to test and control meals, taken after an overnight fast. Test foods were also analysed for in vitro digestion with human saliva. SETTING--Tertiary care centre. PATIENTS--Groups of six drawn from pool of 16 volunteers with diabetes mellitus (11 men, five women; mean age 64 (SE 3); 10 taking insulin, five taking oral agents, one controlled by diet; other characteristics comparable). INTERVENTIONS--All patients took standard white bread control meals on three occasions spanning the study and on different mornings took test meals containing varying ratios of whole cereal grains (barley or cracked wheat) to milled flour (75:25, 50:50, 0:100). All meals contained 50 g available carbohydrate and were eaten in 15 minutes. Capillary blood samples were taken for determination of glucose concentrations every 30 minutes for three hours. END POINT--Glycaemic index of foods (= increase in area under blood glucose concentration curve for test food divided by increase in area under curve for white bread control X 100). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Significant trend to lower glycaemic index with increasing proportion of whole cereal grains in test bread (p less than 0.05) and lower in vitro digestibility (p less than 0.001). Breads containing up to 75% whole grain were considered palatable. CONCLUSIONS--Breads containing a high proportion of whole cereal grains may be useful in reducing the postprandial blood glucose profile in diabetics because they are more slowly digested. These breads should be called \"wholegrain\" in distinction to \"wholemeal\" breads made from milled flour.\r"

Blood pressure and serum glucose and cholesterol concentrations were all positively related to each other independent of age, sex, kidney function, and obesity. Similar relations between the risk factors were found in subjects with hypertension or hyperglycaemia independent of the degree of overweight. These results suggested that there might be a metabolic syndrome of cardiovascular risk factors. Serum calcium concentration was positively related to systolic and diastolic blood pressures and serum glucose and cholesterol concentrations. Thus a common feature in the syndrome is an increased serum calcium concentration. The relations between serum calcium concentrations and the cardiovascular risk factors were not limited to the upper parts of the distribution, being seen over a wide range. Changes in calcium metabolism seem to be related to a metabolic syndrome of hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperlipidaemia.\r"

Data from the third morbidity study in general practice were used to compare capitation fees with relative workload in differing age and sex groups. The population mix which determined the payment by capitation for the 143 principals in the study provided the basis for examining the advantage or disadvantage the general practitioner got from the existing system. Capitation fees for the elderly underestimated the increased workload by 21% for those aged 65-74 and by 54% for those aged 75 or over but overestimated the workload for male adults aged up to 65. Nevertheless, 60% of the participating general practitioners were not advantaged or disadvantaged by more than 2.5% of their capitation fees (450 pounds a year for the average practitioner with a list of 2000 patients). Similarly 88% were not advantaged or disadvantaged by more than 5%; none were advantaged or disadvantaged by more than 10%. A three scale capitation fee for the age groups 0-64, 65-74, and 75 or over should be applied in the ratio of 3:5:7 rather than in the present ratio of 3:4:5, but given the present population mix in practices there is no case for differential capitation fees by sex or differential fees for the age group 0-4 years.\r"

Thirty two patients (mean age 76) in whom valve replacement was contraindicated were followed up for three to 24 months (mean 8); 25 were in functional class III or IV according to the New York Heart Association's classification. Major complications of the procedure occurred in four patients. Echocardiography and Doppler studies were performed before operation and before discharge in 28 patients, and the area of the valve was measured again six to 50 (mean 23) weeks after operation in 11 patients. The peak to peak aortic pressure gradient fell from a mean of 65 (SD 24) to 46 (20) mm Hg, but the area of the aortic valve, measured by Doppler echocardiography, in 18 patients showed a modest but significant increase, from 0.61 (0.16) to 0.74 (0.23) cm2. One month after dilatation, 29 patients were alive, of whom 17 had improved symptoms. Only two had lasting clinical benefit. Sixteen patients died, 12 of a cardiac cause. The estimated one year survival rate was 49%. Six patients underwent or required valve replacement because of persisting symptoms. In view of its limited long term efficacy balloon dilatation of the aortic valve should be used only for patients with severe symptoms whose life expectancy is limited by other disease or who are considered to be unsuitable for valve replacement. It may have a role in improving the condition of patients who present with cardiogenic shock or pulmonary oedema before valve replacement is undertaken.\r"

Voluntary performance was assessed with a cycle ergometer to exhaustion and by maximal isometric contractions of the quadriceps femoris. The mean maximal heart rate in patients during ergometry was 89% of the predicted rate, and quadriceps strength was either normal or was inappropriate for the available muscle, which suggested submaximal effort. Contractile performance was examined in the absence of volition with stimulated contractions of the adductor pollicis. During stimulated fatiguing activity patients were neither weaker nor more fatigable than controls; thus the excess fatigue experienced by the patients was not due to a defect of the contractile apparatus. The increased perception of effort must therefore be due to impairment of central rather than peripheral mechanisms. The optimal approach to treatment of effort syndromes combines physical and psychological techniques.\r"

In addition, risk factors were studied in order to help in targeting of such treatment to specific groups of patients. DESIGN--Double blind, placebo controlled, randomised, parallel group with endoscopic assessments at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. SETTING--Multicentre outpatient study at secondary referral centres in five European countries. PATIENTS--297 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis over the age of 18 without lesions in the stomach and duodenum at baseline endoscopy (after one week without taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Those taking other antirheumatic agents, concomitant ulcerogenic drugs, or treatment for peptic ulcers within the previous 30 days were excluded. Age, sex, arthritic disease, and type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used were comparable in the two treatment groups. In all, 263 patients completed the trial. INTERVENTIONS--Ranitidine 150 mg twice daily or placebo (plus the selected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) was prescribed within five days after the baseline endoscopy for two consecutive periods of four weeks. Paracetamol was permitted during the study, but not antacids. Patients were withdrawn if the most severe grade of damage (including ulceration) was found at the four week endoscopy or when indicated, or with lesser damage at the investigator's discretion.

During the study period 30,000 patients were seen in the same accident and emergency departments of East Berkshire after road traffic incidents or accidents, of whom 267 either were brought in dead or died within two hours after arrival. Of these patients, 64 (24%) were found to have died of natural causes due to pre-existing disease or to have been killed in an incident that occurred as a result of a medical or psychiatric condition. Twelve of the patients sustained physical injury; all 64 came to necropsy. Only one incident resulted in the death of another person in addition to the natural death of a patient. It is concluded that sudden natural death occurring in road users does not present an appreciable hazard to other road users.\r"

To determine whether this might be due to an underlying endocrine disturbance basal concentrations of luteinising hormone were measured in 54 infertile women treated with pulsatile luteinising hormone releasing hormone and concentrations at the time of maximum follicular growth were measured in 23 of the patients. Forty one patients ovulated. Forty one patients ovulated and 27 conceived, but nine pregnancies terminated within four weeks after ovulation. Basal luteinising hormone concentrations were significantly lower in those who conceived (12.4 (range 1.3-29.0) IU/l) than in those who did not (19.0 (3.5-50.0) IU/l) and in those whose pregnancy progressed (9.6 (1.3-29.0) IU/l) than in those with early loss of pregnancy (17.9 (7.0-29.0) IU/l). Concentrations at the time of maximum follicular growth were significantly lower in women who ovulated (9.4 (2.9-35.4) IU/l) than in those who did not (29.0 (7.0-50.0) IU/l) and in those who conceived (6.2 (2.9-8.5) IU/l) than in those who did not (17.9 (4.0-50.0) IU/l). These results indicate that high concentrations of luteinising hormone during the follicular phase in women with polycystic ovaries have a deleterious effect on rates of conception and may be a causal factor in early pregnancy loss.\r"

Reassessment of those patients prescribed a concentrator in one district showed that 29 out of 61 patients did not fulfil these criteria. Furthermore, in only 28 cases was the daily use of the machine appropriate, though this did not reflect poor patient cooperation but was a result of inadequate prescribing instructions. In addition, 12 out of 54 patients continued to smoke. Overall, in only 18 of the 61 cases was both the prescription appropriate and the concentrator properly used. These results suggest a need for better cooperation between general practitioner and hospital in the initial assessment of patients for long term oxygen treatment and better education of both doctor and patient in the use of oxygen concentrators.\r"

Of the 4155 children included in the analysis, 410 (10%) gave a history of persistent diarrhoea. A comparison with children with acute diarrhoea matched for age showed that 11 factors were correlated with persistent diarrhoea, and strongly associated factors were stools with blood or mucus, or both, lower respiratory tract infection, malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, and antibiotic use before presentation. The peak age was 2 years, and there was no sex difference. Deaths occurred more often in the group with persistent diarrhoea. Although Shigella spp, Campylobacter jejuni, and Giardia lamblia were frequently identified, their rates of isolation were not significantly higher among patients with persistent diarrhoea. No seasonal variation was observed in the rates of persistent diarrhoea. Although the introduction of family food to the diet was associated with higher rates, this factor was difficult to separate from the age dependent risks.\r"

Despite the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics, nephrostomy urine frequently becomes infected (approximately 30% of cases). Noxythiolin irrigation has been used to prevent and treat bladder infections. A double-blind, placebo controlled study was carried out in 20 patients undergoing a single-stage percutaneous nephrolithotomy to evaluate the use of noxythiolin as an upper urinary tract antiseptic. In the patients whose nephrostomy tubes were irrigated with a 2.5% solution of noxythiolin, significant bacterial infection was eliminated from the nephrostomy urine and colonisation of the catheter tip was markedly reduced. Noxythiolin also rendered pre-operative infected bladder urine sterile. There were no untoward local or systemic sequelae in either group of patients. This study indicates that irrigation of the upper urinary tract with noxythiolin solution is safe and may be a useful adjunct to reduce the risk of sepsis in patients undergoing percutaneous drainage procedures.\r"

In contrast, in the groups pre-treated with DES, the first, but not subsequent, injections with Zoladex were associated with a marked surge in luteinising hormone. Treatment with DES beyond the time of the first administration of Zoladex did not provide further endocrinological advantage. Oestrogen priming for 1 month prior to treatment with Zoladex may prevent an exacerbation of signs and symptoms of prostate cancer.\r"

Twelve patients received the escalated doses; subsequent granulocytopenia and a flu-type illness were severe in four of the 12. We observed one partial response of MRI-documented and biopsy-confirmed osseous metastases for 7+ months.

PBL had many natural killer (NK) cells and the highest NK activity, and it showed the highest augmentation of NK activity by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) + recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) among the three groups of lymphocytes. PBL had high lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity of against a broad spectrum of cell lines and moderate activity against autologous tumor cells by increased effector to target (ET) ratio but the lowest ability of IL-2 production of the three groups of lymphocytes. The RLNL not associated with tumor metastasis had a few NK cells and lower NK activity than PBL, but its LAK activity was almost the same but not greater than that of PBL. RLNL had the highest ability of IL-2 production among the three groups of lymphocytes. All activities of RLNL associated with tumor metastasis were lower than those not associated with tumor metastasis. TIL exclusively consisted of T-cells, especially cytotoxic/suppressor T-lymphocytes. NK activity and lymphocyte blastogenesis of TIL were lower than those of other groups. The LAK activity of TIL differed greatly with the case, and it was the highest against autologous tumor cells among the three groups of lymphocytes in three of eight cases. These findings showed that PBL, RLNL, and TIL had characteristic subpopulations of lymphocytes and different functions of host immune responses in lung cancer. Efficient augmentation of the characteristic immune responses will lead to a more effective total cancer therapy.\r"

Systemic treatment, which was started simultaneously with radiotherapy, consisted of a combination of daily oral tamoxifen and a monthly alternation of Doxorubicin + vincristine and cyclophosphamide + methotrexate + 5-fluorouracil (CMF). One of each cycle was given preoperatively at half dosage and five of each were repeated postoperatively at full dosage. All patients became operable. Results of pathologic examination of the operative specimen, available in 51 patients, showed complete disappearance of tumor tissue in breast areas in eight patients, of which three still had positive axillary nodes. After a median follow-up time of 6 years locoregional failure was observed in 12 patients (20%) but in only three (5%) did it occur before distant failure. The actuarial median survival of the entire patient population is close to 4 years. Seven patients are alive without recurrence at greater than 9 years. This aggressive multidisciplinary treatment approach is associated with a projected 30% long-term survival (10 years), excellent local control, but substantial toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) increases coronary artery luminal dimensions by stretching and injuring (\"paralyzing\") the smooth muscle of the arterial wall, we prospectively analyzed spontaneous changes and then intracoronary nitroglycerin-induced changes in segmental coronary artery diameters during the first 30 minutes after uncomplicated single-vessel PTCA in 10 patients. Five additional patients received intravenous nitroglycerin throughout the procedure to determine whether nitroglycerin could prevent vasoconstriction after PTCA. All of the patients were maintained on oral doses of diltiazem and aspirin at the time of the study. Coronary arteriography was performed at 2, 5, 15, and 30 minutes after PTCA and then 3 minutes after 300 micrograms i.c. nitroglycerin. Quantitative measurements (computerized edge-detection) were performed at each time, in coronary segments centered in the dilated segment, distal to the dilated segment, and in a control vessel not manipulated with the balloon catheter or guidewire. Progressive vasoconstriction (defined as a loss of diameter that was reversed by intracoronary nitroglycerin) was observed after PTCA in the dilated and distal segments (10 of 10 patients) but not in the control segment. The vasoconstriction in the dilated segment at 30 minutes (mean, 30 +/- 4%) was highly statistically significant compared with vasoconstriction at 2 and 5 minutes after PTCA (p less than 0.001) and compared with the control segment at 30 minutes (p less than 0.005). There was no significant loss of diameter after PTCA in the dilated segment in the five patients who received intravenous nitroglycerin. In conclusion, 1) spontaneous coronary artery vasoconstriction after PTCA occurs routinely at and distal to the site of balloon dilatation despite pretreatment with aspirin and calcium channel blockers; 2) coronary artery vasoconstriction after PTCA is rapidly reversed by intracoronary nitroglycerin and can be prevented by the continuous administration of intravenous nitroglycerin during and after the procedure; 3) these results are incompatible with the hypothesis that PTCA improves coronary luminal dimensions by arterial \"paralysis\"; and 4) these findings have implications concerning the etiology and prophylaxis of abrupt vessel closure after PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "Adrenergic hyporesponsiveness in congestive heart failure has been understood previously in terms of a reduction in beta-adrenergic receptors. We have examined another hypothesis, one that states the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) that couples the beta-adrenergic receptor to adenylate cyclase activity is also decreased in congestive heart failure. In addition to the 40% decrease in lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors in patients in congestive heart failure (5.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 9.7 +/- 1.4 fmol/mg, p less than 0.05), we found an 80% decrease in levels of Gs compared with age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (72.5 +/- 19 vs. 376 +/- 73 fmol/mg, p less than 0.05). Myocardial Gs levels correlated significantly with lymphocyte Gs levels. We also assessed the hypothesis that reductions in beta-adrenergic receptors and in Gs are reversible after successful therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Treatment with either captopril or lisinopril was associated with clinical improvement, an increase in beta-adrenergic receptor density (from 5.5 +/- 0.7 to 8.7 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg), and a twofold increase in Gs levels (p less than 0.05). Thus, the data are compatible with Gs serving as an adaptable and reversible regulator of the adrenergic response in congestive heart failure. In view of the fact that Gs is a transducing element common to all hormones that stimulate cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate production, the observations could extend to other abnormal neurohumoral mechanisms in congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".U": "89052036\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the involvement of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in secondary hypertension, we examined hormonal and renal responses to ANP infusion (0.025 microgram/kg/min) in 27 patients with renal parenchymal hypertension, 10 with primary aldosteronism, 8 with renovascular hypertension, and 15 normotensive subjects. The preinfusion plasma concentration of ANP was significantly higher in patients with renal parenchymal hypertension (120 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and in patients with primary aldosteronism (98 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) than in the normotensive subjects (40 pg/ml), but it was not greater than in the patients with renovascular hypertension (73 pg/ml, NS). In the patients with renal parenchymal hypertension, plasma ANP correlated negatively with creatinine clearance (r = -0.76, p less than 0.001). Mean blood pressure (-5%, p less than 0.01) and plasma aldosterone (-40%, p less than 0.001) decreased to a similar degree in the four groups during ANP infusion. However, an increase in urinary sodium excretion caused by ANP was higher in the hypertensive than in the normotensive patients (+250% vs. +70%, p less than 0.01) and correlated positively with mean blood pressure during ANP infusion (r = 0.47, p less than 0.001). The removal of adenomas in the patients with primary aldosteronism significantly lowered both plasma levels of ANP and cyclic guanosine 2',3'-monophosphate and reduced an increase in sodium excretion during ANP infusion, whereas the responses of blood pressure and plasma aldosterone to ANP infusion were not altered by the operation. Thus, these results suggest that elevated ANP secretion and increased natriuretic responses to ANP may modify the blood pressure and body fluid volume status in some types of secondary hypertension.\r"

Sixty-one patients who required central TPN were randomized into one of two groups: group 1 (n = 31) received TPN plus NSA (25 to 37.5 g/day) until their measured serum albumin was greater than 3 g/dl, and group 2 (n = 30), who received TPN alone. All patients were followed for hospital complications until discharge or death. The groups were well matched for age, sex, major diagnoses, initial serum albumin concentrations, hospital complications before TPN, and number of operative procedures. Both groups received comparable doses of energy (37.2 +/- 89 vs. 3.30 +/- 6.2 kcal/kg.day) and protein (1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3 g/kg.day). After initiation of TPN, there were significantly more hospital complications in group 2 (1 = 1.1 +/- 1.4, n = 33; 2 = 2.6 +/- 3.0, n = 80, p less than .01). When complications in the patient groups were stratified, significantly more patients in group 2 developed pneumonia (18 vs. 9, p less than .05) and septicemia (11 vs. 2, p less than .05). Increasing serum albumin concentrations with NSA in hypoalbuminemic patients receiving central TPN appears to be associated with a reduction in hospital morbidity.\r"

Since the volume of oxygen consumed by the respiratory muscles must contribute to the increase in VO2 (delta VO2), we explored whether delta VO2 and/or measurements of respiratory power output (Wresp) provide clinically useful information in the evaluation of disease state and weaning decisions in patients with respiratory failure. We determined the metabolic, ventilatory, and hemodynamic responses of ten patients during weaning from controlled mechanical ventilation, and compared delta VO2 and Wresp of patients without overt heart-lung disease (group 1) to that of patients with significant cardiopulmonary dysfunction and ventilator-dependent respiratory failure (group 2). We reasoned that for delta VO2 to be clinically useful, individual values must either clearly differ between groups, must be higher in patients with heart-lung disease, and/or correlate with weaning outcome and independent measurements of respiratory work. The VO2 increased in nine of ten patients. The differences between the groups in the values of delta VO2 (27 ml/min and 49 ml/min) and respiratory power (9.38 J/min and 11.99 J/min) were not significant. delta VO2 and Wresp were not correlated (r = 0.2), and neither predicted weaning outcome. We conclude that the sensitivity and specificity of delta VO2 and Wresp appear insufficient for evaluation of disease state and weaning decisions in individual patients.\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports of pulmonary rehabilitation programs have demonstrated improvement in exercise capacity in subjects with disabling pulmonary disease. However, the cost-effectiveness, benefits to outpatients in a community setting, durability of these improvements, and mechanism of improved exercise capacity remain unclear. Forty-four patients with an average FEV1 of 33 +/- 4 percent of predicted completed a six-week long period of supervised treadmill exercise, as well as a continuing home program. Twenty percent had previously unsuspected cardiac disease discovered through the program, while 36 percent had previously unsuspected exercise desaturation. Cardiopulmonary stress testing before and after the program revealed a 73 +/- 16 percent improvement in aerobic capacity (METs peak [power]) and a 250 +/- 78 percent improvement in endurance (MET-min [work]). No significant change was seen in VE max, HR max, FEV1, or the degree of exercise desaturation. Only a small improvement was noted in VO2 max (15 +/- 8 percent) and O2 pulse (16 +/- 8 percent), suggesting that most of the improvement was due to improved muscle efficiency. Follow-up testing at 12 +/- 3 months in 24 subjects revealed that 89 +/- 7 percent of the peak exercise performance was maintained. The cost of the basic program was +800. The results demonstrated that an outpatient community hospital pulmonary rehabilitation program can accomplish substantial exercise capacity improvement with sustained benefits in a cost-effective manner.\r"

One concern was mechanical ventilation of patients with critical illness or terminal conditions. Information was requested concerning the factors that influence treatment decisions. This report brings together opinions from medical experts in focus groups about a variety of issues raised by the OTA. The answers to those questions represent the therapeutic dilemma facing the decision-maker dealing with the elderly patient and a condition of prognostic uncertainty. Although a variety of responses is presented, some uniform trends among experts are evident. Considering the current public policy debate concerning catastrophic and long-term care of the elderly, the need is apparent to establish a clearing-house of information providing documentation, education, and networking. A documentation center would serve as a resource for public policy and program planning to serve the population that requires prolonged mechanical ventilation.\r"

The severity of side effects (based on need to alter treatment), the nature of each drug's most common side effects, and the doses and plasma levels of occurrence were recorded. Our results show that usually accepted therapeutic ranges are well tolerated. Indeed, although some form of side effect occurred in 50% of patients, treatment had to be changed in only 18% and the drug had to be stopped in only 7%. In decreasing order, the rates for side effects were PHT (71%) greater than PB (64%) greater than CBZ (43%) greater than VPA (43%) greater than PRM (29%). Serious side effects requiring withdrawal of treatment occurred at the following rates: PHT (10%) greater than VPA (8%) greater than PRM (8%) greater than PB (4%) greater than CBZ (3%). Among our patients, the best tolerated antiepileptic drug (AED) was CBZ, and the least tolerated was PHT. Behavioral disorders were most common with PB, neurologic disorders with PHT, digestive tract disorders with VPA, and gingival hyperplasia and hirsutism with PHT. Behavioral disorders involving excitement seen with PB and PRM occurred most commonly at low plasma levels. Behavioral disorders involving depression seen with PB and VPA, those involving excitement seen with PHT and VPA, and digestive disorders seen with VPA occurred particularly when plasma levels were high.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty Japanese patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and 94 normal subjects were genotyped for BglII restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) of the T-lymphocyte-receptor beta-chain (TLR beta)-region gene and analyzed in relation to HLA-DR phenotypes. The antigen frequencies of DR4 and DR9 in the IDDM population were significantly higher than those in the normal population, with relative risks of 1.87 (P less than .02) and 2.42 (P less than .01), respectively. Hybridization of digested DNA with the TLR beta probe revealed two alleles of 9.3 and 8.6 kilobases (kb). The allele frequency of 8.6 kb in patients with IDDM (79%) was significantly (P less than .05) higher than that in normal subjects (64%). When TLR beta-region RFLP in IDDM was further analyzed with respect to the HLA-DR phenotypes, the frequency of 8.6 kb was significantly increased in patients with DR4 but not DR9 (DR4/X) and those with DR9 but not DR4 (DR9/X) compared with the frequency found in normal subjects (P less than .05); the relative risks of 8.6 kb in DR4/X and DR9/X were 2.77 and 4.98, respectively. Although the frequencies of HLA-DR phenotypes and of TLR beta-region RFLP in IDDM and normal subjects were apparently different from those reported for Caucasians, this population-association study indicates that in the Japanese, genes conferring susceptibility to IDDM exist near or at the HLA-DR and the TLR beta loci, as has been demonstrated in Caucasians.\r"

  ".W": "The BB rat spontaneously develops autoimmune abnormalities such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and thyroiditis. The autoimmunity of the BB rat is controlled in part by genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), known as the RT1 complex in the rat, and accumulating evidence suggests the involvement of MHC class II molecules. The RT1 complex specifies two types of class II molecules, which are encoded by the loci RT1.B and RT1.D. We have determined the relative steady-state mRNA levels of the class II genes RT1.B beta, RT1.D alpha, and RT1.D beta in splenic lymphocytes from individual autoimmune BB rats of various ages and from age-matched histocompatible normal Wistar-Furth (WF) rats. The relative steady-state mRNA levels of the RT1.D alpha and RT1.D beta genes, but not of the RT1.B beta gene, were elevated approximately 2.5-fold in lymphocytes of prediabetic BB rats 45-75 days old in comparison with age-matched normal WF rats and older BB rats greater than 75 days old. In the diabetic and nondiabetic BB rats greater than 75 days old, the RT1.D alpha and RT1.D beta transcripts were found at lower normal levels, similar to that of WF rats. In contrast, the RT1.B beta transcripts were found at comparable levels in lymphocytes of the BB and WF rats at all ages examined. The increased steady-state mRNA levels of the RT1.D alpha and RT1.D beta genes in the prediabetic BB rats may reflect differences in the proportion of lymphocytes expressing these genes and thus differences in splenic lymphocyte populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There is also evidence linking AR activity with retinal capillary basement membrane thickening in galactosemic rats, suggesting a possible role in diabetic retinopathy. In this study, we explored one feature of this issue by examining diabetic and nondiabetic eyes for immunoreactive AR. AR was immunohistochemically undetectable in the retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) and neural retinas of nondiabetic human eyes. Weak, focal staining for AR was present unilaterally in the RPE of 1 of 11 diabetic patients without pathologic ocular findings and in 43% of diabetic patients with mild ocular findings. Retinal positivity was found (unilaterally) in only 2 of 19 individuals from either of these mildly affected groups. Fifty-five percent of patients with background retinopathy demonstrated AR positivity in the RPE, and half of these expressed AR in the RPE of both eyes. Of the individuals with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 87.5% showed bilateral staining in the RPE. Retinal positivity was present in 36% of background retinopathy and 75% of proliferative retinopathy cases, demonstrating a positive correlation between AR expression and the severity of the disorder. In weakly staining retinas, only the ganglion cell bodies, nerve fibers, and Muller cells were positive, whereas in intensely staining cases, virtually the entire retina, except for the rod outer segments, was positive. Eyes from patients who had had diabetes less than or equal to 6 yr were negative for AR, but those from long- term-diabetic patients (14-45 yr) manifested positively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Otherwise well patients with biopsy-proven hepatic cirrhosis secondary to previous excess alcohol intake were studied. Prior to study, in basal state, patients had identical blood glucose concentrations but raised serum insulin concentrations (cirrhotic: 8.5 +/- 0.8 mU per liter; matched control subjects: 5.7 +/- 0.5 mU per liter, p less than 0.01). Muscle glycogen content, glycogen synthase activity and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity were normal in the basal state. The cirrhotic patients required less glucose to maintain the clamp in response to 0.1 unit per kg per hr insulin (6.7 +/- 0.5 vs. control 8.3 +/- 0.4 mg per kg per min, p less than 0.05) and deposited less glycogen in muscle during the clamp (8.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 12.0 +/- 1.4 mg per gm protein, p less than 0.05). Glycogen deposition correlated with clamp glucose requirement in the cirrhotic patients (r = 0.78, p less than 0.05). The expressed activity of glycogen synthase activity was significantly lower in cirrhotic patients at the end of the clamp (26.5 +/- 1.1% vs. 30.9 +/- 1.6%) and again correlated with clamp glucose requirement (r = 0.82, p less than 0.05). Skeletal muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was not different in patients and control subjects. Insulin insensitivity in hepatic cirrhosis appears to be related to abnormalities of glucose deposition as glycogen in skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".U": "89053240\r", 
  ".W": "Hemorrhagic disorders are common in patients with liver cirrhosis and result from several factors including impaired platelet function. We evaluated platelet aggregation and arachidonic acid metabolism in response to standard agonists in platelet-rich plasma from 12 cirrhotic patients with mild impairment of liver function (Child A), 12 patients with severe liver dysfunction (Child B and C) and 12 healthy subjects. Platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 production were consistently reduced in patients with severe liver impairment. To determine whether the platelet dysfunction is due to an intrinsic platelet defect or a circulating inhibitor, we measured platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 synthesis on washed platelets in healthy subjects and in Child B and C patients. The aggregating response of washed platelets in response to thrombin, collagen and arachidonic acid was markedly reduced, suggesting an intrinsic platelet defect. The biochemical events underlying platelet aggregation were investigated by prelabeling platelets with [1-14C]arachidonic acid. Thrombin-induced activation of phospholipase C (measured as the release of [1-14C]phosphatidic acid) and phospholipase A2 (measured as the release of [1-14C]arachidonic acid and its metabolites) was greatly impaired in platelets from patients with severe liver impairment. We conclude that in advanced cirrhosis there is a severe reduction in platelet aggregatory response to physiologic agonists due to an intrinsic platelet defect which is related to an impairment of the platelet transmembrane signaling mechanism induced by receptor stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Accumulating evidence suggests that hypertension in blacks is manifested in part by impaired renal excretion of salt. Consequently, this study was performed to determine if hypertensive and normotensive black subjects differ in their ability to generate known natriuretic substances. Fourteen normotensive and 11 hypertensive blacks were maintained on constant metabolic diets containing either 40 or 180 mmol of salt per day for 14 days each. During the last 4 days of each salt intake period, urine was collected for measurement of sodium, dopamine, and norepinephrine. On the last day of each 14-day dietary period, blood pressures were measured, blood was collected for measurement of plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and aldosterone, and urine was collected over 2 hours for measurement of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Both the normotensive and the hypertensive groups manifested salt sensitivity; their mean arterial pressure rose by 7 +/- 0.2 and 6 +/- 0.2%, respectively, when salt intake was increased from 40 to 180 mmol/day. The hypertensive group exhibited decreased (p less than 0.05) dopamine excretion as compared with the normotensive group for both dietary salt intakes. Plasma ANF levels increased (p less than 0.05) in the hypertensive group, but not in the normotensive group, with increasing dietary salt. Plasma aldosterone and urinary norepinephrine and PGE2 were comparable in the two groups for both dietary salt intakes. These data suggest that salt sensitivity is not unique to hypertensive blacks but occurs in normotensive blacks as well. Decreased renal production of dopamine may be a pathogenic factor in the development and maintenance of hypertension in blacks.\r"

The pattern of distribution implies the involvement of ANF in different physiological functions, such as blood pressure regulation, electrolyte and fluid homeostasis, and modulation of the neuroendocrine system. To further investigate a possible involvement of central ANF in spontaneous hypertension, we measured levels of ANF in 18 selected, microdissected brain areas of prehypertensive (4-week-old) and hypertensive (12-week-old) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their normotensive control, Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), by radio-immunoassay. ANF was significantly decreased in seven brain areas in SHR at both ages investigated; the most pronounced decreases were found in the subfornical organ, in the perifornical and periventricular hypothalamic nuclei, and in the medial preoptic nucleus. In addition, in young SHR ANF was significantly decreased in the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis and increased in the median eminence. After the development of hypertension, a significant decrease of ANF could be detected in four more brain areas (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular and arcuate nuclei, dorsal raphe nucleus) of SHR, as compared with normotensive controls, and the increase in the median eminence was no longer detectable. These results suggest a role for ANF in genetic hypertension and the specific importance of certain brain regions.\r"

Clinical trials have demonstrated that thrombolytic therapy can indeed reduce mortality, but one must critically examine study data. It is difficult to compare the results of different studies with varying inclusion-exclusion criteria, sample size, study designs, and interventions. At present, it appears that t-PA plus heparin and aspirin therapy produces the lowest mortality at 14 days, 30 days, and 3 months after MI. In addition, the time-critical nature of thrombolytic therapy must be ingrained in the critical care nurse's assessment process. To reduce mortality in the patient with acute MI, assessment and initiation of therapy must be prompt.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with neurologic disorders are frequently burned in mishaps related directly to their diseases. Once burned, these patients face a mortality rate significantly greater than that of the burn population as a whole. To assess the impact of neurologic disease on burn care, we reviewed the records of 37 patients admitted to our burn center with burns and neurologic illness. Thirty-three patients (89%) sustained injuries directly related to their neurologic problems, the most frequent being bathtub scalds (29.8%) and scald/spills (24.3%). We compared 31 of these patients having nonextensive burn injuries (less than or equal to 25% total body surface area) to a control population with similar-sized burns from our burn unit during the study period. This comparison revealed significantly longer length of stay for the neurologically impaired sample. We presume that costs of care are also increased for this sample. The high frequency of burn injury among neurologically impaired persons, coupled with the greater difficulty in caring for them, suggests that this group should receive intensive burn prevention educational efforts.\r"

Cushing's syndrome was characterized by abdominal obesity and enlarged abdominal fat cells, with adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity elevated 2-3 times that in normal women and low lipolytic capacity. Muscle tissue in women with Cushing's syndrome had a relatively low proportion of type I (30%) and a high proportion of type IIB (32%) muscle fibers, similar to those in android obesity (45% and 25%, respectively) and in contrast to fiber composition in gynoid obesity (55% and 12%, respectively). Glycogen synthase activity in the lateral vastus muscle was very low. We suggest that the enlargement of abdominal fat depots in women with Cushing's syndrome is at least partially due to elevated adipocyte lipoprotein lipase activity and low lipolytic activity. Furthermore, the abnormal muscle fiber composition might be caused by the corticosteroid excess. Such muscle is known to be relatively insulin insensitive and might thus contribute to the marked insulin resistance that occurs during chronic corticosteroid excess.\r"

Fluidity was assessed by fluorescence polarization, using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene as a probe, and AchE and Na+,K+-ATPase activities were measured enzymatically. We found a significant increase in the enzymatic activity of AchE and a change in its enzymatic properties in diabetic patients compared with those in normal subjects. AchE activity correlated inversely with membrane fluorescence polarization, which was decreased in the diabetic patients, indicating an increase in membrane fluidity. Na+,K+-ATPase activity was reduced in the diabetic patients and correlated positively with the fluorescence polarization values. We hypothesize that the abnormal dynamic properties of the erythrocyte membrane may play a major role in determining the described change in enzymatic activity.\r"

The ANF infusions induced changes in plasma ANH concentrations entirely within the range for normal subjects. The small increases in plasma ANH values were associated with a significant rise in urinary excretion of sodium, magnesium, calcium, and cGMP. PRA and plasma aldosterone concentrations uniformly decreased to 50% and 64% of placebo values, respectively. Systolic and mean arterial pressures fell significantly from preinfusion values during the ANH infusions. These findings constitute strong evidence that ANH is a hormone of physiological significance in the regulation of body fluid volumes in normal man.\r"

  ".W": "Men with the complete form of isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (initial mean testes volume less than 4 mL) require 2 or more yr of exogenous gonadotropin therapy combining hCG and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) to achieve maximal, but subnormal, testis size and sperm output. To test whether pulsatile GnRH therapy, which more closely mimics normal hormonal stimulation, would accelerate or further augment testicular growth, hasten the onset of sperm production, and/or increase sperm output more than occurs during conventional exogenous gonadotropin therapy, we administered either hCG/hMG or GnRH from the inception of therapy to 2 comparable groups of men with complete IHH (initial testicular volume, less than 4 mL) and compared their testicular responses during the first 2 hr of therapy. Five men were treated with pulsatile GnRH in doses of 143-714 ng/kg every 2 h, sc, while 11 other men received hCG (2000 IU) and hMG (75 IU FSH and 75 IU LH) im 3 times/week. In the GnRH-treated men, the mean plasma total and free testosterone levels during therapy rose to within the normal range, but were significantly lower (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.02, respectively) than those in the hCG/hMG-treated men. The mean plasma estradiol concentrations during therapy were within the high normal range and were similar in the two groups. The mean plasma FSH levels achieved in the GnRH-treated men were significantly (P less than 0.01) and 1.3- to 3.2-fold higher than those in the hCG/hMG-treated men. The mean testicular size achieved in the GnRH-treated men was not significantly different from that in the hCG/hMG-treated men (P = 0.08); the mean testicular volumes after 2 yr were 4.8- and 4.3-fold the pretreatment values in the GnRH and hCG/hMG groups, respectively. After 12 months of therapy, sperm production had occurred in one man in the GnRH group and in no subject in the hCG/hMG group. After 24 months, two men in the GnRH group and eight men in the hCG/hMG group produced sperm. Thus, 40% of the GnRH-treated men and 80% of the hCG/hMG-treated men (P = NS) produced sperm after 2 yr of therapy. The sperm concentrations in all men were below 5 million/mL and were comparable in the two groups (P = NS). These results suggest that pulsatile sc GnRH therapy for the first 2 yr does not accelerate or enhance testicular growth, hasten the onset of sperm production, or increase sperm output significantly compared to hCG/hMG.\r"

A population of subjects matched for age and sex adapted to 3000 meters above sea level living in Colombia, South America, was also studied (mean O2 saturation, 94 +/- 0.7%). Hypoxemia, either induced at sea level or as a consequence of high altitude living, resulted in significant inhibition of aldosterone secretion after progressive administration of increasing doses of ACTH, but did not affect the cortisol response to ACTH. In addition, it was associated with higher plasma atrial natriuretic hormone levels. PRA declined only during acute hypoxemia induced at sea level and did not change during sea level normoxemia or high altitude living. Plasma sodium and potassium concentrations were no different in the three experimental conditions. We conclude that hypoxemia inhibits ACTH-stimulated aldosterone secretion and speculate that atrial natriuretic hormone may have mediated this effect.\r"

Serum from nine subjects with FDH whose mean serum total T4 (TT4) concentration was 203 +/- 27 nmol/L were matched for TT4 concentrations with serum from nine subjects with acquired TBG excess (TT4, 201 +/- 23 nmol/L) and nine subjects with thyrotoxicosis and normal TBG concentrations (TT4, 205 +/- 28 nmol/L). The subjects' CT4 results were compared to their serum free T4 concentration, measured by equilibrium dialysis (DT4), and their serum free T4 index (FT4I) value. The mean serum DT4 value for the subjects with FDH (23 +/- 5 fmol/L) and those with TBG excess (23 +/- 3 fmol/L) were normal, whereas it was elevated (44 +/- 9 fmol/L; P less than 0.001) for the thyrotoxic patients with normal TBG concentrations. The mean CT4 value also was normal for the subjects with FDH (37.7 +/- 4.9 fmol/plate) and those with TBG excess (36.6 +/- 4.6 fmol/plate), but was elevated for the thyrotoxic patients (62.3 +/- 11.2 fmol/plate; P less than 0.001). In all three groups studied, the relationship between individual CT4 and DT4 values was similar to that previously found in subjects with no T4-binding protein abnormalities. The mean serum FT4I value was lower for the subjects with acquired TBG excess (111 +/- 22) than for the subjects with FDH (133 +/- 22; P less than 0.05), and it was much higher for the subjects with thyrotoxicosis (221 +/- 31; P less than 0.001). In the subjects with FDH and those with thyrotoxicosis the normal relationship between CT4 and FT4I was maintained, while in the subjects with acquired TBG excess, FT4I values were lower than expected. In seven of the nine subjects with TBG excess, the abnormality was associated with conditions known to increase its sialic acid content: hepatitis (one subject), pregnancy (four subjects), and estrogen therapy (two subjects). The CT4 values were similar in nine subjects with acquired TBG excess (seven pregnant women and two subjects with chronic active hepatitis) and five subjects with familial TBG excess (34.8 +/- 4.3 vs. 34.0 +/- 8.6 fmol/plate, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The TSH-secreting cells were excitable and had calcium-dependent action potentials. More than 80% of the cells cultured from the two patients with TSH-secreting adenomas were spontaneously active, whereas fewer cells (20%) cultured from the hypothyroid patient were spontaneously active. TRH (50 nmol/L) induced a complex pattern of electrical changes. The initial response was transient hyperpolarization (activation of potassium conductance), followed by increased low amplitude voltage fluctuations occasionally leading to action potentials. These TRH-induced electrophysiological changes were similar to those reported in rat and human PRL-secreting adenoma cells. These results suggest that TRH may have an identical mode of action in tumoral PRL and TSH cells. In the cells from the hypothyroid patient, the initial response to TRH cells was similar, but the second phase response was greater. The findings that the cells cultured from these patients behaved differently with regard to their electrophysiological characteristics (action potentials) and responses to TRH may reflect the different clinical conditions from which they were derived.\r"

Six normal men were studied on four occasions: 1) Arg-TRH, 30 g arginine were administered in 500 mL saline in 30 min, followed by an injection of 200 micrograms TRH; 2) GHRH-Arg-TRH, 100 micrograms GHRH-(1-44) were given iv as a bolus immediately before the Arg infusion, followed by 200 micrograms TRH, iv; 3) GHRH test, 100 micrograms GHRH were given as an iv bolus; and 4) TRH test, 200 micrograms TRH were given iv as a bolus dose. Blood samples were collected at 15-min intervals for 30 min before and 120 min after the start of each infusion. Anterior pituitary cells from rats were coincubated with Arg (3, 6, 15, 30, and 60 mg/mL) and GHRH (0.05, 1, 5, and 10 nmol/L) for a period of 3 h. Rat GH was measured in the medium. After Arg-TRH the mean serum GH concentration increased significantly from 0.6 to 23.3 +/- 7.3 (+/- SE) micrograms/L at 60 min. TRH increased serum TSH and PRL significantly (maximum TSH, 11.1 +/- 1.8 mU/L; maximum PRL, 74.6 +/- 8.4 micrograms/L). After GHRH-Arg-TRH, the maximal serum GH level was significantly higher (72.7 +/- 13.4 micrograms/L) than that after Arg-TRH alone, whereas serum TSH and PRL increased to comparable levels (TSH, 10.2 +/- 3.0 mU/L; PRL, 64.4 +/- 13.6 micrograms/L). GHRH alone increased serum GH to 44.9 +/- 9.8 micrograms/L, significantly less than when GHRH, Arg, and TRH were given. TRH alone increased serum TSH to 6.6 +/- 0.6 mU/L, significantly less than the TSH response to Arg-TRH. The PRL increase after TRH only also was lower (47.2 +/- 6.8 micrograms/L) than the PRL response after Arg-TRH. In vitro Arg had no effect on basal and GHRH-stimulated GH secretion. Our results indicate that Arg administered with GHRH led to higher serum GH levels than did a maximally stimulatory dose of GHRH or Arg alone. The serum TSH response to Arg-TRH also was greater than that to TRH alone. We conclude that the stimulatory effects of Arg are mediated by suppression of endogenous somatostatin secretion.\r"

Plasma estradiol, progesterone, inhibin, LH, and FSH concentrations were measured by RIA on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and compared with the ovarian steroid and gonadotropin profiles obtained from seven endocrine-normal women. The elevated FSH concentrations in the hypergonadotropic group were not associated with significant changes in E2 and P4, but an increase in LH concentrations was found on days 1, 8, and 22 (medians of 18 and 4, 17 and 6, and 7 and less than 3 U/L for the hypergonadotropic and normal groups, respectively; P less than 0.01). Their plasma inhibin concentrations [213, 242, 747, and 561 U/L (median values on days 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, and 22-28)] were normal. Autoantibodies to adrenal, thyroid, or ovary were present in five (50%) women, and antiovarian antibodies were present in 4. Two women gave a family history of thyroid disease, and one woman was hypothyroid. Repeat assessment 3-6 months revealed persistently elevated FSH concentrations in five (63%) of eight women; the other three had normal ovarian steroid and gonadotropin concentrations. The triad of infertility, regular menses, and elevated plasma FSH concentrations describes a group of women with occult ovarian failure, a condition of compensated granulosa cell function, which may be an early stage of premature ovarian failure. These women with occult ovarian failure had an impaired response to ovarian hyperstimulation and may be at increased risk of developing polyglandular autoimmunity.\r"

  ".W": "A morphological study was carried out on pituitary adenomas removed from 13 normoprolactinemic and 9 hyperprolactinemic acromegalic patients whose hormonal dynamics had been carefully investigated. Double immunocytochemical labeling with the protein-A-gold electron microscopic technique was used to detect the presence of GH and PRL in the adenomas. Two morphological patterns were found; 11 adenomas contained cells positive only for GH, and 11 contained a variable proportion (from 10-98%) of cells positive for PRL. The great majority of cells positive for PRL also were positive for GH and so were actually mammosomatotrophic cells. Among the normoprolactinemic patients, no cells containing PRL were found in the tumors from 8 patients, and 10-26% of the cells of the tumors of the other 5 patients contained PRL. Two thirds of the hyperprolactinemic patients had tumors containing mammosomatotrophs (18-80%) with or without the concomitant presence of mammotrophs (0-18%). A positive correlation was found between the serum PRL levels and the percentage of mammosomatotrophs. No significant differences in GH secretory responses to TRH, dopamine, GHRH, and SRIH were found between patients having tumors with or without cells positive for PRL. We conclude that 1) the frequency of mammosomatotrophs in adenomas from acromegalic patients is higher than that previously estimated using different immunocytochemical methods; and 2) serum GH responses to TRH and dopamine are not strictly related to the presence of mammosomatotrophs and/or mammotrophs within the tumor.\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis by human amnion increases with the onset of labor and is thought to participate in the initiation and maintenance of parturition. Since cortisol levels increase in amniotic fluid in late pregnancy, we studied the effects of glucocorticoids on cultured term human amnion cell PGE2 output. In 24-h studies, the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone stimulated basal PGE2 output 2-fold over control levels at 16-500 nmol/L. PGE2 output was dramatically stimulated (greater than 10-fold) when, after dexamethasone pretreatment, the cells were incubated with calcium ionophore A23187 or arachidonic acid (AA) for 2 h. Maximum effects were achieved at 31 nmol/L dexamethasone. Basal PGE2 output was stimulated at 12 h of dexamethasone treatment, whereas A23187- or AA-stimulated PGE2 output was enhanced after 3-6 h of dexamethasone pretreatment. Cortisol (50 and 500 nmol/L) also enhanced basal and stimulated PGE2 output, while dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 17 beta-estradiol, and progesterone were ineffective. The glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 38486 attenuated dexamethasone-enhanced basal and stimulated PGE2 output. Dexamethasone pretreatment had no effect on basal or stimulated PGE2 output from cultured term chorion cells, suggesting tissue specificity. We conclude that glucocorticoids specifically enhance PGE2 output from cultured amnion cells via a receptor-mediated mechanism. We speculate that the action of glucocorticoids is to increase the capacity of the cells to convert AA to PGE2.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibin is a gonadal hormone thought to be important in FSH regulation. We investigated the effects of the hypogonadotropic state and subsequent GnRH-induced increases in gonadotropin levels on inhibin secretion. Serum levels of inhibin, LH, FSH, and testosterone (T) as well as sperm concentrations were measured in 5 men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) before (baseline) and during 8 weeks of GnRH therapy (5 micrograms, sc, every 2 h). Baseline and peak inhibin levels were compared to those in a group of 19 normal men. Before GnRH administration, the mean serum inhibin level was significantly lower in the IHH men than in the normal men [166 +/- 56 (+/- SE) vs. 588 +/- 30 U/L; P less than 0.001]. Serum inhibin levels rose after 1 week of GnRH therapy (P less than 0.05) and remained higher than the baseline level thereafter. The mean peak inhibin level during GnRH administration was lower than the mean value in normal men (485 +/- 166 vs. 588 +/- 30 U/L; P less than 0.05). Serum LH and FSH levels rose promptly to the midnormal range or slightly above it. Serum T levels did not significantly increase until 4-5 weeks of GnRH administration and remained in the low normal range. All IHH men were azoospermic throughout the study. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibin is produced by the testis under gonadotropin control. They also suggest the possibility of defective Sertoli and Leydig cell function in men with IHH, since the men's serum inhibin and T levels did not rise to the same extent as did their normalized serum gonadotropin levels during GnRH administration.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoids increase GHRH-stimulated GH secretion when added in vitro to cultured monkey, rat, and human pituitary cells and when injected in vivo into anesthetized rats. Yet, in man glucocorticoids inhibit linear growth and GH secretion. To clarify this apparent disparity and to determine if glucocorticoid stimulation can augment GH release in man after direct pituitary stimulation with GHRH, we administered 1 microgram/kg GHRH dosage to seven normal men before and after a 4-day course of prednisone (20 mg, orally, three times daily). The second GHRH test was done 12 h after the last dose of prednisone was given. Prednisone significantly inhibited the mean maximal increase in serum GH after GHRH treatment [20.7 +/- 4.5 (+/- SE) vs. 6.3 +/- 2.4 micrograms/L; P less than 0.01] as well as the GH value obtained by summing and averaging the individual means of the 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 min serum GH concentrations (11.1 +/- 1.2 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.9 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05). The mean serum insulin-like growth factor I and plasma glucose concentrations were not significantly altered by prednisone administration. These results together with previous in vitro findings imply that glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of GH secretion in man does not occur at the level of the pituitary gland, but, rather, at the hypothalamus or above.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibin is a glycoprotein hormone produced by the testis and ovary which is postulated to be an important regulator of pituitary FSH secretion. Animal data indicate that inhibin is produced by the Sertoli cells of the testis under the influence of FSH. To determine the role of FSH withdrawal and replacement in the control of inhibin secretion in man, we measured serum inhibin concentrations in men in whom isolated FSH deficiency had been produced by chronic hCG administration; this was followed by FSH replacement. After a 3-month control period, four normal men received hCG for 7 months, resulting in suppression of serum FSH to undetectable levels and urinary FSH excretion to prepubertal levels. Their mean serum inhibin levels fell to 70% of control values during hCG administration [362 +/- 60 (+/- SE) vs. 518 +/- 56 U/L; P less than 0.01]. While continuing hCG, testosterone enanthate was administered for a further 6 months. Serum FSH and inhibin levels remained suppressed to a similar degree. Testosterone administration then was ceased, and hCG continued for a further 2-4 months. Then, while continuing hCG administration, FSH was replaced as either highly purified human FSH (n = 2) or human menopausal gonadotropin (n = 2) for a period of 4-10 months. Serum FSH levels increased to the mid- and upper normal male ranges, respectively. FSH replacement restored serum inhibin levels to 522 +/- 56 U/L (P = NS vs. control). In summary, prolonged selective FSH deficiency induced by chronic hCG administration suppressed inhibin secretion. Replacement of FSH activity restored inhibin secretion to control values. We conclude that 1) FSH is not absolutely required for inhibin secretion in men; and 2) the maintenance of quantitatively normal inhibin secretion requires the combined action of both gonadotropins.\r"

Twenty ovariectomized monkeys were divided into four sc treatment groups: a) 1.0 mg/kg Nal-Glu-GnRHant; or Nal-Lys-GnRHant at b) 0.3; c) 1.0; d) 3.0 mg/kg. Each monkey received vehicle (propylene glycol/water, 1:1) on day 0, followed by an antagonist preparation on day 11. Serum LH and FSH were measured by RIA; serum LH was also measured by in vitro bioassay. The short-term effects were similar among the four treatment groups. Typically, serum LH declined (p less than 0.05) within 4 to 8 h, achieving maximal reduction by 24 h. Serum FSH levels declined more slowly, but were significantly reduced by 24 h (p less than 0.05). Recovery during the study interval to pretreatment control values occurred in only two groups: a) Nal-Glu-GnRHant (1.0 mg/kg) by day 4 post-treatment and b) Nal-Lys-GnRHant (0.3 mg/kg) by day 2 post-treatment. Monkeys receiving 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg Nal-Lys-GnRHant had a prolonged inhibition of serum LH and FSH levels. In all animals, serum FSH and LH returned to control levels within 2 months. The duration of gonadotropin inhibition was also prolonged when the Nal-Lys-GnRHant was administered iv. In contrast, Nal-Glu-GnRHant reduced serum LH and FSH for 3 days or less in all monkeys. The serum bioassayable LH levels paralleled those of immunoassayable LH. The prolonged inhibition of gonadotropin secretion following Nal-Lys-GnRHant distinguishes its action from those of previous GnRH antagonists and make this compound of great interest for clinical investigations.\r"

These results compare favourably with those obtained using non-heated triple cryoprecipitate. Cryoprecipitate can be heat treated without adversely influencing factor VIII recovery, and the ability to prepare a heat treated cryoprecipitate means that a small pool high yield factor VIII preparation can again be used in routine clinical practice.\r"

Ninety two of 200 (46%) of isolates had an MIC to spectinomycin of 32 mg/l on DST agar. Isolates seemed to be more resistant when tested on the two other media. The methods used in this study could be applied in a routine diagnostic laboratory for immediate clinical benefit and long term epidemiological studies. To enable direct comparisons to be made between populations at different centres, however, methods for gonococcal susceptibility testing need to be standardised.\r"

In three patients the appearance of skin lesions heralded a rapidly deteriorating clinical course, but two other patients had reasonably long survivals despite cutaneous disease (6 and 3 years, respectively). Two histopathologic configurations were identified in cutaneous lesions: nodular and infiltrative. Both patients with the latter form had multiple myeloma. In all cases tumor cells were pyroninophilic. Immunoperoxidase studies on fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues confirmed the electrophoretic findings in two cases, but findings were equivocal in three others. In one case, cells were positive for epithelial membrane antigen, and in another, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin-positive cells were observed in the centers of tumor islands. Cutaneous involvement with plasma cell neoplasms is recognized infrequently. Immunohistochemical techniques may prove to be valuable in evaluating these cases, but they are not without technical and interpretative difficulties.\r"

We believe that this patient's condition represents an unusual connective tissue disease syndrome consisting of abortion, livedo reticularis, thrombocytopenia, circulating \"anticoagulant,\" negative or slightly positive antinuclear antibodies, and false positive results on nontreponemal serologic tests for syphilis. Sclerodermoid lesions were also a unique feature in our patient.\r"

Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide withdrawn from the right atrium before and during sustained ventricular tachycardia (mean tachycardia cycle length 320 +/- 68 ms, duration greater than 30 s) were determined by radioimmunoassay. Hemodynamic measurements included phasic femoral artery blood pressure and mean right atrial blood pressure before and during ventricular tachycardia. During ventricular tachycardia, atrial natriuretic peptide increased from 93 +/- 49 pg/ml to 234 +/- 195 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), systolic arterial blood pressure decreased from 120 +/- 16 to 70 +/- 23 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), diastolic arterial blood pressure decreased from 63 +/- 8 to 51 +/- 16 mm Hg (p = NS) and mean right atrial blood pressure increased from 3 +/- 1 to 8 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.02). In six patients, all hemodynamic variables and the atrial natriuretic peptide were measured during repeated stimulation protocols to investigate the effect of ventricular stimulation for ventricular tachycardia induction on atrial natriuretic factor release. Compared with the values obtained during sinus rhythm, there was no significant increase in atrial natriuretic factor during ventricular stimulation at a cycle length of 600 ms (45 +/- 20 versus 52 +/- 21 pg/ml) or at a cycle length of 400 ms (45 +/- 20 versus 57 +/- 18 pg/ml). No significant linear relation could be found among the changes in mean right atrial pressure, systolic arterial blood pressure and the increase in atrial natriuretic peptide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this 26 center trial, patients were randomized to receive either placebo or 100 mg rt-PA intravenously over 3 h. Heparin (5,000 U bolus injection and then 1,000 U/h) and aspirin (250 mg initially, then 75 to 125 mg every other day) were given to all patients until angiography was performed (10 to 22 days after allocation). Enzymatic infarct size was found to be 20% smaller in the rt-PA group (2p = 0.0018) than in the control group. At angiography, 83% of rt-PA-treated patients had a patent infarct-related vessel compared with 77% of the placebo-treated patients. Ejection fraction was 2.2% points higher (2p = 0.04) and end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were +/- 6 ml smaller (2p = 0.003) than in the control group, indicating an improved left ventricular pump function in the thrombolysis group. Cardiovascular complications such as shock, ventricular fibrillation and pericarditis were markedly fewer in patients treated with rt-PA, but bleeding complications occurred more frequently. An intracranial hemorrhage within 3 days after the infusion of rt-PA was observed in five patients (1.4%). None of these bleeding episodes was causally related to death. Although this European Cooperative trial was not designed primarily as a mortality study, important reductions in early mortality rates were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred eighty-four patients were allocated to noninvasive treatment and 183 to an invasive/intervention policy. Immediate angioplasty was attempted in 168 patients (92%) of the latter group. The trial was terminated after a data review by the ethical monitoring committee showed no benefit in the \"invasive\" group in terms of enzymatic infarct size or left ventricular function, and a trend (although not statistically significant) toward increased mortality in the intervention group. Analysis of coronary patency and residual stenosis at the time of discharge showed no difference in patency rate, but less residual stenosis in the intervention group. The study differed from the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) and the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Phase-IIB (TIMI-IIB) trials in that the philosophy of intervention to produce the earliest and most complete reperfusion resulted in a high incidence of angioplasty procedures in vessels not yet reperfused. The reasons for the failure of this philosophy to show benefit are uncertain, but may include an increased risk of reocclusion after angioplasty or reperfusion damage, or both.\r"

The cumulative experience and data base afford the opportunity to address several important questions regarding aggressive therapy of myocardial infarction. These include predictive factors of in-hospital mortality, improvement of left ventricular function and the occurrence of recurrent ischemia. Consideration of practical issues, such as thrombolytic therapy for patients with cardiopulmonary resuscitation or previous stroke, use of coronary artery bypass surgery and the effect of operator experience on angioplasty success rate, has also been made possible. The major accomplishments as well as the deficiencies of the current approach to patient management after thrombolysis are reviewed, and the new TAMI trials currently underway are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "This review summarizes the multicenter trial results of reperfusion therapy for treatment of inferior myocardial infarction. Therapy with intracoronary streptokinase or intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) produced higher patency rates than did intravenous streptokinase. Reocclusion was more common when the right coronary artery was the infarct-related artery, irrespective of treatment strategy. Left ventricular ejection fraction was improved compared with that in control patients, especially when the time from symptom onset was brief or when patency rates were high. Enzymatic infarct size was reduced in treated patients. A trend toward mortality reduction in treated patients was found in four studies and was statistically significant in the Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2) trial. Precordial ST segment depression in inferior myocardial infarction is associated with values for enzyme release, left ventricular ejection fraction and mortality similar to those in anterior infarction. Patients with inferior infarction who present within 6 h of symptom onset with precordial ST segment depression should be considered candidates for intravenous thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA; immediate cardiac catheterization and possible coronary angioplasty should be limited to those who are in hemodynamically unstable condition. Patients without precordial ST segment depression who present within 3 h of symptom onset and who do not have risk factors for bleeding should also be candidates for intravenous rt-PA therapy. The prognosis of other patients with inferior myocardial infarction is so good that the issue of thrombolytic therapy remains unsettled.\r"

In an attempt to understand better the in vivo therapeutic effects of these drugs, a double-blind, crossover study was carried out. The study compared the effects of terfenadine and loratadine, nonsedative H1-receptor antagonists, on the immediate allergic response of the upper airways to challenge with orchard-grass pollens in 14 highly allergic subjects. Increasing numbers of pollen grains were insufflated into the nostrils, and the response of the subjects was assessed by examining symptoms and measuring the release of histamine and prostaglandin D2 in nasal secretions. Each drug was administered for a week before challenge. This study demonstrated the clinical efficacy of both drugs by comparison to that of a control day, since symptoms were observed for a significantly (p = 0.014) greater number of pollen grains. Only one patient had a significant release of histamine when they were treated with loratadine versus 10 during control day (p less than 0.0023) and six when they were treated with terfenadine (p less than 0.01). Prostaglandin D2 release occurred with a higher allergen dose when patients were treated with both drugs. This study indicates that some H1 antagonists also possess antiallergic activities.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical evidence exists which suggests that normal pigment cell (melanocyte) function is subject to hormonal influences, but the nature of these interactions at a cellular level is poorly understood. We have investigated the effects of the vitamin D-derived secosteroid hormone 1 alpha-25, dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the pituitary-derived peptide alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), and the sex steroid beta-estradiol on melanocytes cultured from normal human foreskin. Human melanocytes specifically internalized 1,25(OH)2D3 with high affinity (Kd 0.5-0.8 nM). Incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-9) M) for 48 h resulted in a 100% increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase activity and a 50% increase in tyrosinase activity. There was no significant effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In contrast to 1,25(OH)2D3, alpha-MSH at a concentration of 5 X 10(-7) M caused a sevenfold increase in intracellular cAMP after 12 min but only a modest increase (less than 20%) in melanocyte tyrosinase activity after 48 h. Incubation with beta-estradiol for 24 h caused a dose-dependent increase in tyrosinase activity. The maximal response varied from 145%-213% of basal activity depending on the donor source. These results indicate that melanocytes from normal human foreskin in culture have the capacity to respond directly to several hormones. They also suggest that these cells form a useful model to study the effect of various hormones on pigment cell function.\r"

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay detected high antigenic levels of myeloperoxidase in sputum samples of seven patients with CF. Myeloperoxidase was purified to homogeneity from CF sputum and from blood neutrophils by a three-step technique involving dialysis, gel filtration, and ion-exchange chromatography. CF sputum myeloperoxidase and neutrophil myeloperoxidase appeared identical by acid gel electrophoresis and Ouchterlony experiments. CF sputum myeloperoxidase also contained approximately the same enzymatic activity as neutrophil myeloperoxidase. The myeloperoxidase enzyme system was tested for its cytotoxic potential in a tracheal ring culture system. Myeloperoxidase-induced cytotoxicity for airway epithelium was confirmed by light microscopy and radiolabelling experiments. These findings suggest a possible role for neutrophil myeloperoxidase in CF lung disease.\r"

To explore these questions, mucosal injury was produced in 50 cm small intestinal segments of anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats perfused in vivo for 0, 5, 15, 30, or 45 minutes with buffer containing 5 mmol/L chenodeoxycholic acid, and to assess mucosal restitution, additional rats were perfused for 45 minutes with chenodeoxycholic acid followed by 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes with chenodeoxycholate-free buffer. The above studies were then repeated in rats receiving either intraperitoneal indomethacin (10 mg/kg) or 15 minutes of preperfusion with buffer containing 1.4 mumol/L (0.5 microgram/ml) 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin pretreatment reduced and indomethacin pretreatment increased significantly the morphologic (as measured by quantitative histology) and functional (as measured by mannitol and water absorption) mucosal injury caused by chenodeoxycholic acid. However, neither pretreatment had a major impact on the time course of functional or morphologic mucosal restitution, with nearly complete restitution occurring within 1 hour. Thus, although both endogenous and exogenous prostaglandins have a significant impact on bile acid-induced small intestinal mucosal injury, this effect is not caused by an acceleration of the rate of mucosal restitution.\r"

Our present data show that 1 to 2 MAC sevoflurane has no significant effect on P50 (P greater than 0.05). Our data also show that sevoflurane did not interfere with polarographic measurements of oxygen tension (P greater than 0.05). Other inhaled agents--halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane--do interfere with these measurements, and we cannot explain the difference.\r"

  ".W": "In view of the current concern that rapid infusion of mannitol might initially aggravate intracranial hypertension, the effects of a mannitol infusion on lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) were investigated in 49 patients. The studies were performed when the patients were under general anesthesia prior to elective craniotomy for tumor resection or intracerebral aneurysm clipping. The patients were divided into two groups: 24 patients with normal CSFP (Group I, mean CSFP 10.5 mm Hg) and 25 with raised CSFP (Group II, mean CSFP 20.8 mm Hg). Measurements of CSFP, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), and central venous pressure (CVP) were made serially during and after the infusion of 20% mannitol (1 gm.kg-1 infused over a 10-minute interval). In both groups, mannitol infusion provoked a fall in MABP and an increase in CVP. An immediate decrease [corrected] in CSFP was observed in Group II, whereas CSFP increased transiently but significantly in Group I. Analysis of the arterial and venous driving pressures which contribute to CSFP suggests that the transient increase in CSFP after mannitol in Group I was partly due to the increase in CVP. The presence of intracranial hypertension may thus alter the CSFP response to arterial and venous pressure changes. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) was measured in dogs in a separate study analogous to the human protocol. The CBV increased approximately 25% over control values after mannitol infusion both in the normal animals and in those with CSFP raised by an epidural balloon. The response of the CSFP to mannitol infusion differed between both groups in a fashion similar to that observed in the human subjects. Thus, differences in CBV changes after mannitol do not account for the difference in CSFP response between normal subjects and those with raised CSFP.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperventilation reduces intracranial pressure (ICP) acutely through vasoconstriction, but its long-term effect on vessel diameter is unknown. In seven rabbits with a cranial window implanted 3 weeks earlier, the effect of prolonged hyperventilation on vessel diameter was studied. Anesthesia was maintained for 54 hours with a pentobarbital drip (1 mg/kg/hr). The pH, CO2, and HCO3- levels were measured in arterial blood and cisterna magna cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The diameter of 31 pial arterioles was measured with an image splitter. After baseline measurements, pCO2 was reduced from 38 to 25 mm Hg and allowed to return to 38 mm Hg for 10 minutes every 4 hours. There was an initial vasoconstriction of 13%, which progressively diminished by 3% every 4 hours. Thus, by the 20th hour, vessel diameters at a pCO2 of 25 mm Hg had returned to slightly above baseline values obtained at a pCO2 of 38 mm Hg. The temporary return of pCO2 to 38 mm Hg every 4 hours caused vasodilation: 12% at 4 hours, gradually increasing to 16% at 52 hours. Thus, at 52 hours, the vessel diameters were 105% of baseline at a pCO2 of 25 mm Hg and increased to 122% at a pCO2 of 38 mm Hg. Arterial pH had returned to baseline at 20 hours, and CSF pH had returned at 24 hours. Bicarbonate in blood and CSF remained decreased throughout the experiments. In three control experiments during which normocapnia was maintained, vessel diameter and pH and bicarbonate levels remained unaltered over the same period. The CO2 reactivity, tested by brief periods of hyperventilation every 4 hours, also did not change. These results indicate that hyperventilation is effective in reducing cerebral blood volume for less than 24 hours and that it should be used only during actual ICP elevations. If used preventively, its effect may have worn off by the time ICP starts to rise for other reasons, and further decreases in pCO2 cannot be obtained. Moreover, the reduction in buffer capacity with lower bicarbonate renders the vessels more sensitive to changes in PaCO2. This could lead to more pronounced elevations in ICP during transient rises in PaCO2, such as during endotracheal suctioning in head-injured patients.\r"

To determine whether 201Tl redistribution could be affected by a metabolic intervention, intravenous ribose was administered postischemia. Seventeen domestic swine were subjected to a 10-min ischemic period followed by either a 30-min i.v. ribose (n = 8) or saline (n = 9) infusion. Thallium-201 was injected during ischemia and myocardial 201Tl activity was continuously monitored in ischemic and nonischemic regions with miniature CdTe radiation detection probes. Coronary flow in the ischemic region was reduced to 25% of that in the nonischemic regions in both saline and ribose groups. The 201Tl time-activity curves demonstrated a significant enhancement of % 201Tl redistribution in the ribose-treated animals at the end of ribose infusion: Ribose (48 +/- 11%), Saline (20 +/- 4%), p less than 0.05. Alteration of 201Tl kinetics by ribose may permit earlier recognition of 201Tl myocardial redistribution after transient ischemia.\r"

The method measures integral CO2 production for up to 3 wk from the difference in elimination rates of deuterium and 18O from labeled body water. Validations against near-continuous respiratory gas exchange have demonstrated that the method is accurate and has a precision of 2-8% depending on the isotope dose and the length of the elimination period. Although the method has been validated, there is still some debate on refinements of the kinetic model that may lead to improved accuracy and precision. Because the method only requires periodic sampling of body fluids, it is non-restrictive and ideally suited to use in free-living subjects. Recent applications of the method have included obesity research, determination of energy requirements in both developing and developed countries and studies of human growth.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of injecting phlorizin subcutaneously and/or feeding propionate on metabolism of glucose, propionate and CO2 were determined for four steers used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Isotope dilution techniques were used to determine a four-pool kinetic solution for the flux of carbon among plasma glucose, rumen propionate, blood CO2 and rumen CO2. Injecting 1 g of phlorizin twice daily for 19 d resulted in 7.1 mol glucose C/d being excreted in urine. The basal glucose production of 13.4 mol C/d was increased to 17.9 mol C/d with phlorizin. There was no change in glucose oxidation or propionate production. The percentage of plasma glucose derived from propionate was unaffected by phlorizin, but 54 +/- 0.4% of total propionate was converted to plasma glucose during phlorizin treatment versus 40 +/- 0.6% during the basal treatment. When propionate was fed (18.3 mol C/d) glucose production increased to 21.2 mol C/d from the basal value of 13.4 mol C/d, and propionate oxidation to CO2 increased to 14.9 mol C/d from the basal value of 4.1 mol C/d. Glucose derived from propionate was 43 +/- 5% for the basal treatment and 67 +/- 3% during propionate feeding. The percentage of propionate converted to plasma glucose and blood and rumen CO2 was not affected by feeding propionate. An increased need for glucose, because of glucose excretion during phlorizin treatment, caused an increased utilization of propionate for gluconeogenesis, but an increased availability of propionate caused an increase in glucose production without affecting the relative distribution of carbon from propionate.\r"

In the 28 clindamycin-treated patients, 23 (82%) had a successful outcome, and five (18%) were improved. No failures were noted in either group. One patient who was receiving penicillin and two who were receiving clindamycin developed diarrhea. Bacteriologic results showed an average of 6.1 organisms per culture (2.5 aerobes and 3.6 anaerobes). Resistance rates for anaerobic isolates were 8.9% to penicillin and 1.9% to clindamycin. It was concluded that penicillin and clindamycin produce similar good results in treating odontogenic infection when the rate of penicillin resistance among oral anaerobic bacteria is at a relatively low level.\r"

  ".W": "Because total parenteral nutrition with vitamins added to the glucose-amino acid mixture is often associated with a reduction in blood levels of vitamin A (retinol) during the routine treatment of many very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (less than 1500 gm), and because retinol losses in the plastic delivery system can be prevented by adding the vitamins to an intravenous lipid emulsion, seven VLBW infants with a mean birth weight of 900 gm (range 450 to 1360 gm) were given 40% of a unit dose vial, per kilogram of body weight, of a multivitamin preparation (M.V.I. Pediatric) (280 micrograms retinol; 160 IU vitamin D; 2.8 mg tocopherol; 0.68 mg riboflavin) in a lipid emulsion, Intralipid. After treatment with the intralipid-vitamin mixture for 19 to 28 days, plasma vitamin A (retinol) concentrations increased significantly from 11.0 +/- 0.76 (mean +/- SEM) before intralipid to 19.2 +/- 0.97 micrograms/dl after the intralipid-vitamin mixture (p less than 0.01); 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations increased from an initial value of 12.6 +/- 2.6 to 20.2 +/- 1.9 mg/dl (p less than 0.01); alpha-tocopherol concentrations increased from an initial value of 0.31 +/- 0.06 to 2.44 +/- 0.13 mg/dl (p less than 0.01); and riboflavin levels increased from 64.1 +/- 7.8 ng/ml to concentrations between 20 and 100 times the initial level. Erythrocyte riboflavin levels increased from 71.8 +/- 14 initially to 166 +/- 41 ng/gm hemoglobin, and erythrocyte flavin-adenine dinucleotide levels increased similarly from 972 +/- 112 initially to 2005 +/- 294 ng/gm hemoglobin. These results show that the addition of M.V.I. Pediatric to Intralipid decreases the extensive in vivo loss of retinol and is associated with an increase in plasma retinol concentrations in VLBW infants. The daily doses of vitamins D (160 IU/kg) and E (2.8 mg/kg) appear sufficient, but the dose of vitamin A (280 micrograms/kg) is insufficient to raise blood levels of all infants into the normal range. The current dose of riboflavin is excessive and may be harmful.\r"

We found that long-term ventilatory assistance may predispose diaphragmatic myofibers to disuse atrophy or to failure or normal growth. This phenomenon may contribute to difficulties in weaning infants from ventilatory support.\r"

Follow-up clinical status was monitored and compared, and plasma prostaglandin levels were analyzed. Chronic lung disease was increased in duration and tended to be more severe after lipid administration. The number of days of mechanical ventilation (37 +/- 35 vs 21 +/- 18) and supplemental oxygen therapy (51 +/- 39 vs 28 +/- 23) was significantly increased in the IL group. Five IL infants developed stage 3 bronchopulmonary dysplasia, in comparison with none of the NL infants. Seven IL infants were discharged on a regimen of supplemental oxygen therapy versus none of the NL infants. Thromboxane B2 levels were significantly increased in the babies receiving Vitrum. We conclude that early administration of Vitrum in the premature neonate is associated with increased respiratory difficulty in the ensuing weeks of life.\r"

The presence of severe, unrelenting otalgia, otorrhea with isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a markedly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and evidence of bone destruction on computed tomography scan should alert the clinician to the diagnosis. Unlike adults, children have a higher incidence of seventh nerve paralysis earlier in the course of the infection. They also manifest more frequent involvement of the middle ear with tympanic membrane destruction. The short interval between the onset of symptoms and facial nerve dysfunction highlights the necessity of prompt diagnosis and institution of anti-Pseudomonas therapy. Our review suggests that this destructive bacterial infection is an emerging clinical entity in children; 73% of the cases have been reported since 1980. Pediatricians should therefore be familiar with the clinical presentation of this treatable infection. Substantial morbidity could be alleviated by prompt diagnosis and early antibiotic treatment.\r"

The mean age of the children was 52.4 +/- 37.9 months; they had received total parenteral nutrition for an average of 3 years. Immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG), coagulation studies (platelets, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen, fibrinogen degradation products, factor V) and components of complement (C3, C4, and CH100) were analyzed. Activation of monocytes by opsonized zymosan was measured by chemiluminescence and compared with that of normal control subjects. The clinically stable children had normal monocyte activation and normal complement levels. The PT and PTT values were significantly increased but improved with increased intralipid dose; other coagulation factors were normal. Acutely sick children, however, had decreased fat tolerance with significantly increased serum triglyceride levels and PT and PTT values; their monocyte activation and complement factors remained normal. These data indicate that the dose of intralipid should be lowered during acute illnesses; we suggest close monitoring of PT and PTT values and of serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels to avoid the fat overload syndrome.\r"
