  ".W": "Arterially administered Lipiodol Ultrafluid contrast medium selectively remained in various malignant solid tumors because of the difference in time required for the removal of Lipiodol contrast medium from normal capillaries and tumor neovasculature. Although blood flow was maintained in the tumor, even immediately after injection Lipiodol contrast medium remained in the neovasculature of the tumor. To target anti-cancer agents to tumors by using Lipiodol contrast medium as a carrier, the characteristics of the agents were examined. Anti-cancer agents had to be soluble in Lipiodol, be stable in it, and separate gradually from it so that the anti-cancer agents would selectively remain in the tumor. These conditions were found to be necessary on the basis of the measurement of radioactivity in VX2 tumors implanted in the liver of 16 rabbits that received arterial injections of 14C-labeled doxorubicin. Antitumor activities and side effects of arterial injections of two types of anti-cancer agents were compared in 76 rabbits with VX2 tumors. Oily anti-cancer agents that had characteristics essential for targeting were compared with simple mixtures of anti-cancer agents with Lipiodol contrast medium that did not have these essential characteristics. Groups of rabbits that received oily anti-cancer agents responded significantly better than groups that received simple mixtures, and side effects were observed more frequently in the groups that received the simple mixtures. These results suggest that targeting of the anti-cancer agent to the tumor is important for treatment of solid malignant tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Factors that are chemotactic for phagocytic leukocytes are known to elicit important acute circulatory changes, and the role of circulating leukocytes in these models is controversial. To evaluate the role of the blood vessel wall in the absence of circulating cells, spiral strips of human umbilical artery were exposed in vitro to the chemotactic peptides f-Met-Leu-Phe (1-100 nM) or C5a (2.5-25 nM). Contractile responses were observed for both peptides. Certain agonist analogues and a selective antagonist of the chemotactic action of f-Met-Leu-Phe behaved correspondingly as agonists and antagonist of the contractile effect on umbilical artery. The anaphylatoxin C3a also exerted a contractile effect on the tissue (25 nM and above), but this effect was highly tachyphylactic. Inhibitory drugs were used to examine the contributions of secondary mediators in eliciting the effects of C5a and f-Met-Leu-Phe. The contractile effect of both peptides was massively inhibited either by indomethacin or the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 antagonist SQ 29548. Dazmegrel, a thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor, had partial inhibitory effects on contractions induced by either peptide. The contractile effect of C3a was prevented by indomethacin pretreatment. Vascular strips did not release measurable histamine in the bathing fluid after challenge with C5a or f-Met-Leu-Phe. The tissue apparently contains neither histamine nor mast cells. Autoradiography of 125I-labeled C5a or f-Met-Leu-Phe analogue showed specific binding of the peptides to cells dispersed in the vessel wall, but more frequently at the periphery. Cells stained positively for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase showed a similar distribution. Pure cultures of smooth muscle cells derived from the umbilical artery failed to release prostanoids when exposed to f-Met-Leu-Phe or C5a, whereas fresh strips of this artery released more thromboxane B2 than the baseline in response to these peptides. We conclude that macrophagelike cells, present in the vessel wall, are the likely target cells for the chemotactic peptides. These cells trigger a contractile effect of the smooth muscle by generating cyclooxygenase products.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported that 5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (5,6-EET) was the only cytochrome P-450-dependent arachidonic acid (AA) epoxide to dilate the isolated, perfused caudal artery of the rat. We have investigated the mechanisms by which 5,6-EET dilates the rat-tail artery by studying the effect of deendothelialization and inhibition of AA metabolic pathways (cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase) on the vascular action of the epoxide. Rat isolated caudal arteries were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, and gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2. Arterial tone was elevated with phenylephrine; acetylcholine (0.5 nmol) was used to detect the presence of intact, functional endothelium. Doses of 5,6-EET, from 6.25 to 25.0 nmol, were injected close-arterially. After obtaining control responses, the same doses were randomly retested after deendothelialization or in the presence of inhibitors of AA metabolism. Removal of the endothelium decreased by 70% the vasodilator responses to 5,6-EET. The endothelial dependency was a function of the epoxide interacting with cyclooxygenase of the endothelium, because indomethacin (3 microM) and aspirin (50 microM) prevented the vasodilator response to 5,6-EET while not affecting the response to acetylcholine. SKF-525A (1.1 microM) and metyrapone (150 microM) did not affect the responses to the 5,6-EET, whereas clotrimazole (0.7 microM) and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (2.5 microM) had nonspecific effects, decreasing responses to 5,6-EET and acetylcholine. Because 5,6-EET failed to stimulate detectable release of prostanoids into the effluent from the caudal artery, we conclude that 5,6-EET requires conversion by cyclooxygenase for expression of its vasoactivity.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the temporal effects of plasmin generated in vivo on platelet function, we infused tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in rabbits over 3 hours and measured ex vivo platelet aggregation. We noted an initial increase in the aggregation response to ADP occurring 30 minutes after the start of infusion. This enhanced response was short-lived and by 180 minutes was reduced, compared with pretreatment levels. Baseline aggregation response was restored by 240 minutes. This pattern of aggregation response to t-PA infusion was also seen with thrombin as the agonist. Coinfusion of either prostaglandin I2 or prostaglandin E1 abolished the initial hyperaggregable phase induced by t-PA; the hypoaggregable phase occurred earlier (after 60 minutes) and persisted throughout the 1-hour recovery period. Similarly, streptokinase infused for 1 hour also increased platelet aggregation at early times and then reduced aggregation responses after the first hour. Plasma plasmin activity increased as expected with t-PA infusion alone, peaking at 30 minutes and returning to baseline by the first hour. Interestingly, prostaglandin E1 blunted the rise in plasma plasmin activity. This same dose of prostaglandin E1 or prostaglandin I2 used alone did not appreciably alter platelet function at any time during the experiment. Our data show that therapeutic doses of t-PA or streptokinase produce a biphasic effect on platelet aggregation response in the rabbit. Coinfusion of either of the antiplatelet agents, prostaglandin E1 or prostaglandin I2, abolishes the hyperaggregable phase and prolongs the inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation produced by t-PA. These data suggest that the effects of thrombolytic agents on platelet function are complex and can be modulated by antiplatelet prostaglandins.\r"

In the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), a multicenter study of patients with ejection fractions of 35% or less, we compared baseline plasma norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, plasma atrial natriuretic factor, and plasma arginine vasopressin in 56 control subjects, 151 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (no overt heart failure), and 81 patients with overt heart failure before randomization. Median values for plasma norepinephrine (p = 0.0001), plasma atrial natriuretic factor (p less than 0.0001), plasma arginine vasopressin (p = 0.006), and plasma renin activity (p = 0.03) were significantly higher in patients with left ventricular dysfunction than in normal control subjects. Neuroendocrine values were highest in patients with overt heart failure. Plasma renin activity was normal in patients with left ventricular dysfunction without heart failure who were not receiving diuretics and was significantly increased (p less than 0.05) in patients on diuretic therapy. We conclude that neuroendocrine activation occurs in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and no heart failure. Neuroendocrine activation is further increased as overt heart failure ensues and diuretics are added to therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Chemical conjugates between recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA) and a murine monoclonal antibody directed against fragment D-dimer of cross-linked human fibrin (MA-15C5), rscu-PA/MA-15C5, and between rscu-PA and a control monoclonal antibody (MA-1C8), rscu-PA/MA-1C8, were produced by cross-linking with N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP). In an in vitro system composed of a [125 I]fibrin-labeled baboon plasma clot immersed in autologous citrated plasma, dose- and time-dependent lysis was obtained with a ratio of the potencies of free and conjugated rscu-PA similar to that in human plasma: 50% lysis in 2 hours required 4.3 micrograms/ml rscu-PA, 1.0 microgram/ml urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) equivalent rscu-PA/MA-15C5, or 15 micrograms/ml u-PA equivalent rscu-PA/MA-1C8. The thrombolytic and pharmacokinetic properties of rscu-PA and of rscu-PA/MA-15C5 were compared in baboons with a 0.8-1.0 ml [125 I]fibrin-labeled autologous blood clot produced in a femoral vein. Continuous intravenous infusion of these compounds during a 2-hour period resulted in dose- and time-dependent lysis. The thrombolytic potency of rscu-PA/MA-15C5 was 3.0 +/- 0.5 times higher (50% lysis with 0.3 +/- 0.02 mg u-PA equivalent/kg body wt) than that of rscu-PA measured by ex vivo isotope recovery from the femoral vein segment (p less than 0.001) and was 2.7 +/- 0.5 times higher (50% lysis with 0.35 +/- 0.02 mg/kg rscu-PA/MA-15C5) by external radioisotope counting (p less than 0.001). A dose of 0.5 mg/kg of rscu-PA/MA-1C8 was much less active than rscu-PA. After the end of the infusion, u-PA-related antigen disappeared from plasma in a biphasic manner with an initial half-time of 2.7 +/- 0.5 for rscu-PA, 24 +/- 1.2 for rscu-PA/MA-15C5, and 21 +/- 0.5 minutes for rscu-PA/MA-1C8 with corresponding plasma clearances of 340 +/- 40, 20 +/- 3, and 24 +/- 2 ml/min, respectively. In conclusion, the increased thrombolytic potency of rscu-PA/MA-15C5 is the result of a reduction of the thrombolytic potency due to coupling of rscu-PA to the antibody molecule, which is counter-balanced by an enhancement of the thrombolytic potency due to fibrin targeting by the specific idiotype.\r"

  ".W": "Protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation in patients is occasionally associated with life-threatening acute pulmonary hypertension. In a sheep model, we evaluated the effect on this adverse cardiopulmonary reaction of modifying the type of heparin (low molecular weight heparin compared with unfractionated heparin) and the type of heparin antagonist (polybrene compared with protamine). Protamine reversal of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and polybrene reversal of unfractionated heparin induced more than a 10-fold increase of plasma thromboxane B2 levels, a threefold increase of pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure, and a 25% decrease of PaO2. A similar adverse reaction followed protamine reversal of conventional unfractionated heparin. However, with polybrene (1 mg/kg) reversal of LMWH (1 mg/kg), we measured neither pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure was 22.6 +/- 3.6 mm Hg at 1 minute after polybrene reversal of LMWH compared with 47.9 +/- 4.2 mm Hg after protamine reversal of unfractionated heparin, p less than 0.005 groups differ), hypoxemia (PaO2 was unchanged 2 minutes after polybrene compared with a decrease of 26 mm Hg 2 minutes after protamine, p less than 0.05), nor acute release of thromboxane into arterial plasma (thromboxane B2 was 0.2 +/- 0.1 at 1 minute after polybrene compared with 3.7 +/- 1.7 ng/ml at 1 minute after protamine, p less than 0.005). The hemodynamic effects and mediator release were also benign after neutralization of larger doses of LMWH (3 mg/kg) by polybrene (3 mg/kg). The increases of activated clotting time and activated partial thromboplastin time due to both types of heparin were completely reversed with polybrene. Anti-Xa activity increased to more than 3 IU/ml 4 minutes after LMWH anticoagulation (p less than 0.01) but was only partially neutralized by polybrene. Various polyanion-polycation complexes that are formed when heparin anticoagulation is reversed induce thromboxane release and acute pulmonary vasoconstriction in awake sheep. Reversal of LMWH anticoagulation with polybrene does not elicit this adverse reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Alterations in vessel wall reactivity (VR) at or adjacent to the dilation site after balloon angioplasty (BA) may vary according to the inflation protocol and the time after angioplasty and may influence outcome. In 64 atherosclerotic rabbit femoral arteries, we evaluated VR after BA with intravenous ergonovine (ERGO) (40 micrograms/min for 5 minutes) and intra-arterial nitroglycerin (NTG) (2,500 micrograms single bolus) 24-72 hours and 28 days after BA. Comparisons were made with atherosclerotic, nonangioplastied, age-matched controls. BA was standardized to three 1-minute inflations, each 1 minute apart. For each balloon size, 2.5- (appropriate size) or 3.0-mm (oversized) vessels were allocated to either 5 or 10 atm inflation pressure. For the analysis, four groups were compared: Group 1, 3.0/5; group 2, 3.0/10; group 3, 2.5/5, and group 4, 2.5 mm/10 atm. Angiographic diameters were measured at, proximal, and distal to the lesion at baseline, 10 minutes after ERGO, and 5 minutes after NTG. Angiograms were measured with electronic calipers by two blinded observers. All segments of control vessels vasoconstricted to ERGO and vasodilated to NTG (p less than 0.05 versus baseline), indicating a normal response. At 24-72 hours after dilatation, the angioplasty sites for all inflation pressure/balloon size combinations were not responsive to either ERGO or NTG. All segments distal to the dilatation sites vasoconstricted to ERGO and dilated to NTG (p less than 0.05 versus baseline), indicating a normal response. Proximal segments of vessels dilated with a 2.5-mm balloon (appropriate size) responded positively to both stimuli (p less than 0.05). Those vessels dilated with a large balloon (3.0 mm) were nonreactive in the segment proximal to the angioplasty site. Twenty-eight days later angioplasty sites dilated with a 2.5-mm balloon (appropriately sized) regained reactivity; however, segments dilated with a large balloon (3.0 mm) remained unresponsive. All proximal segments, including those from vessels dilated with a large balloon, reacted positively. All distal segments reacted appropriately. Restenosis rates were not different between the over- and appropriately sized balloon groups. These data demonstrate that immediately after angioplasty, vessels lose reactivity at the dilatation site. Those vessels dilated with the smaller-size balloon (2.5 mm) regained reactivity. For large balloons, reactivity is not regained at 28 days. For segments proximal to the site of dilatation, transient loss of reactivity is seen only when a large balloon is used. Thus, acute closure originating at the site of dilatation is not a result of spasm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the hypothesis that induction immunosuppressive therapy with murine anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (OKT3) reduces the frequency of rejection episodes in heart transplant recipients receiving 3-drug maintenance therapy with cyclosporine, azathioprine, and steroids. A group of 26 adult heart transplant recipients requiring preoperative intravenous inotropic drugs or with elevated serum creatinine received OKT3 induction as well as long-term triple drug therapy. Cyclosporine was withheld for the first 4 postoperative days allowing for resolution of cardiogenic renal dysfunction. A corresponding group of 26 heart transplant recipients received triple drug therapy alone started immediately before transplantation. Both groups were comparable in age, sex distribution, and follow-up period. The frequency of rejection episodes was identical for the two groups (0.003 episodes per patient month). Time to first rejection episode in the induction group, however, was delayed twofold as compared with the noninduction group (42 versus 21 days, p less than 0.01). Actuarial survival at 6, 12, and 18 months was 88%, 81%, and 81% for the induction group and 92%, 92%, and 87% for the noninduction group (p = NS). Treatment for rejection was not required in 35% of the induction group and 38% of the noninduction group (p = NS). OKT3 provides satisfactory immunosuppression in heart transplant recipients with hemodynamic or renal compromise, yet it does not reduce the frequency of rejection episodes compared with patients receiving triple drug therapy alone. Although the time to first rejection may be delayed, routine adjuvant use of OKT3 for induction in all heart transplant recipients may incur needless expense without providing an important immunological advantage as compared with triple drug immunosuppression alone.\r"

The benefits of corticosteroid-free maintenance immunosuppression include the absence of the cushingoid habitus, fewer infections, less obesity, and lower serum cholesterol. The incidence of allograft coronary artery disease is not increased by corticosteroid-free maintenance. To assess the long-term effects of corticosteroid-free immunosuppression on allograft function, we compared results of hemodynamic study and noninvasive evaluation over the 2-year follow-up of 57 patients on corticosteroid-free maintenance to 40 patients who required corticosteroid. Age and pretransplantation diagnoses were similar, but a greater percentage of those who required corticosteroid maintenance were female (28% versus 2%, p less than 0.001). Indexes of allograft function were similar in both groups and these indexes included ejection fraction, right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and posterior wall thickness. Patient survival was identical in the two groups (98%). These data indicate that corticosteroids can be safely withdrawn with the subsequent early benefits and without compromising long-term allograft function.\r"

  ".U": "91029993\r", 
  ".W": "Secondary valvular stenosis is a significant risk of annular ring implantation during valvular repair in children. To avoid this problem, we have developed an absorbable prosthetic ring (APR), which induces the generation of a biologic fibroelastic ring with mitotic capability and thereby allows atrioventricular annulus growth with age. Twelve polydioxanone (PDS) biodegradable APRs were surgically implanted in immature goats. To avoid possible embolic complications from ring fragments during the absorption period, APRs were covered with an extensible sewing sheath of high-porosity polyester, allowing contact between the PDS, blood, and endocardium. Four APRs were implanted into the right atrial cavity, four in the tricuspid position, and four in the mitral position. Histological studies at 6 months showed a considerable amount of remaining PDS. At 1 year, only small residual fragments of PDS were present, surrounded by collagen and elastic fibers as well as fibroblasts with mitotic activity. This histological structure represents a new biologic fibroelastic ring, which has originated from PDS rings. Echocardiography at 12 months showed that the elasticity of APRs and fibrotic tissue allows normal systolic and diastolic valve motions. These findings, which demonstrate histological changes in native valve annuli as well as stable and elastic annuloplasty without secondary stenosis in growing animals, call for new studies involving hearts with valvular disease.\r"

Plasma was passed through a C18 disposable column, the DLF eluted with methanol and separated by HPLC on a C8 column. Immunoreactive DLF were measured in each 1 ml HPLC fraction using radioimmunoassay (RIA) for digoxin. The immunoreactive peaks were determined and aliquots from each peak analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy (FAB-ms). The compounds in the five major HPLC immunoreactive peaks were identified as: 1) dehydroepiandrosterone glucuronide and tetrahydrocortisone glucuronide; 2) epiandrosterone glucuronide; 3) dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androsterone glucuronide; 4) epiandrosterone sulfate and 5) androsterone sulfate and androstanediol glucuronide. These immunoreactive DLF represent 70% of the total plasma immunoreactive DLF of 0.124 micrograms digoxin equivalents/l. Aliquots of the HPLC fractions were also assayed for ability to displace ouabain from Na,K-ATPase. The ouabain displacing DLF gave a very different elution pattern from that obtained by RIA with the major Na,K-ATPase ouabain displacing DLF eluting in the more polar fractions. They remain unidentified.\r"

The closed-loop feedback mechanism of ovarian inhibin and pituitary FSH has been joined by possible \"inhibin-like\" actions of follistatin and FSH-stimulatory effects of activin. In addition, in vitro experiments suggest possible autocrine and paracrine functions for the gonadal polypeptide hormones. Figure 3 shows a simplistic diagram summarizing our current understanding of inhibin/activin and follistatin action along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Hopefully, research in the coming years will allow us to remove the many question marks still remaining but will undoubtedly add others.\r"

Simultaneous serum, soft-tissue, and bone samples were obtained at regular intervals during surgery. All soft-tissue and bone samples were corrected for cefazolin content. The percentage of cefazolin penetration into soft tissue and bone was calculated using the area under the concentration time curve. Adequate cefazolin concentrations for soft tissue and bone were defined as greater than or equal to 4 x minimum inhibitory concentration90 (MIC90 = 1 microgram/ml) of cefazolin to Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Patients were similar in age, actual body weight, creatinine clearance, and length of tourniquet inflation. The median percentage of cefazolin penetration into soft tissue and bone for the five-, two-, and one-minute groups was 14.5% and 4.6%, 6.7% and 3.0%, and 5.9% and 4.6%, respectively; the percentage of penetration into soft tissue between the five- and one-minute groups was statistically significant. A higher percentage of patients achieved the desired cefazolin concentration (greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/g) if a five-minute interval was selected. The five-minute group achieved the highest mean ratios of concentration to MIC compared with the two- and one-minute groups, although the differences were not statistically significant. The standard 1 g of cefazolin with a five-minute interval between administration and tourniquet inflation resulted in adequate mean soft-tissue and bone concentrations for prophylaxis during TKA with a tourniquet time less than two hours. Additional doses are not warranted after tourniquet release.\r"

This study was designed to compare the effects of two calcium antagonists, isradipine and diltiazem, on antipyrine and indocyanine green (ICG) clearances in the elderly. Eighteen elderly subjects (aged 65 to 80 years) received either isradipine (5 mg every 12 hours), diltiazem (90 mg every 8 hours), or placebo (every 12 hours) for 4 days. On the third day after the study treatment, a 0.5 mg/kg dose of ICG was administered. Blood samples were obtained over 20 minutes for HPLC determination of ICG plasma concentrations. Ten minutes later, subjects ingested 1.2 gm antipyrine. Blood samples were obtained over 48 hours for HPLC determination of antipyrine plasma concentrations. Mean +/- SD antipyrine clearance after diltiazem (0.0258 +/- 0.0065 L/hr/kg) was significantly lower than that observed after isradipine (0.0334 +/- 0.0098 L/hr/kg) or placebo (0.0329 +/- 0.0082 L/hr/kg). Antipyrine clearance after isradipine was not significantly different from that after placebo. Mean +/- SD ICG clearances after diltiazem (9.17 +/- 1.35 ml/min/kg) or isradipine (9.57 +/- 1.82 ml/min/kg) were significantly higher than that observed after placebo (8.06 +/- 1.45 ml/min/kg). These findings suggest that diltiazem, but not isradipine, affects hepatic enzyme activity in the elderly. Both agents accelerate ICG clearance, a marker of hepatic blood flow.\r"

After administration of ritanserin lower amounts of thromboxane B1 were generated in the initial stages of plug formation, suggesting an inhibitory effect on the platelet prostaglandin metabolism. Similar amounts of beta-thromboglobulin were released after the administration of ritanserin compared with placebo, indicating a minor effect of ritanserin on the release reaction. Reduction of thrombin formation by ritanserin in the later stages of hemostasis suggested an inhibitory effect of this substance on the procoagulatory activity of platelets or endothelial cells. This could be attributable to interference with the formation or function of coagulation factor complexes on cell surfaces, or it could be the consequence of a reduction of the platelet activity.\r"

After 4 weeks of isradipine administered once a day, 54% of the patients showed a complete or partial response, whereas 38% of the patients who were changed to placebo showed a response. In contrast, 82% of patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide once a day showed a response, whereas 60% of patients who were changed to placebo showed a response.

To determine whether alterations in membrane sodium transport in airway smooth muscle can alter its contractility, we studied the effect of ouabain (a Na+/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor) and amiloride on contractile responses in bovine trachea and human bronchial rings in a series of studies. 2. Ouabain (10(-6)-10(-4) mol/l) caused concentration-related contraction of bovine trachea with a maximum effect at 30 min; the mean increases in tension with 10(-6), 10(-5) and 10(-4) mol/l ouabain were 19, 27, and 32%, respectively, of the maximum response seen with 10(-3) mol/l histamine (n = 6). In human bronchial rings, ouabain (10(-5) mol/l) caused a mean contraction which was 40% of the maximum response to methacholine (n = 8). 3. Calcium-free fluid (plus ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and nifedipine (10(-5) mol/l) inhibited ouabain-induced contractions, suggesting that contraction was mediated in part by calcium entry via voltage-dependent calcium channels. Phentolamine (10(-5) mol/l) was without effect. 4. Ouabain (10(-5) mol/l) did not alter histamine responsiveness in bovine trachea or methacholine responsiveness in human bronchial rings. 5.

In contrast, in study 2 there were no significant changes in plasma atrial natriuretic factor during the day; instead, plasma atrial natriuretic factor increased overnight, reaching a peak at 24.00 hours after 1 h of recumbency (P less than 0.01). A smaller rise in plasma guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (P less than 0.05) occurred; urinary sodium excretion decreased markedly (P less than 0.01) and there was no change in creatinine clearance. 5. In both studies, recumbency was associated with an initial drop, followed by a rise, in packed cell volume. 6. These data demonstrate that assumption of the supine position induces a rise in plasma atrial natriuretic factor and accounts for most of the observed variation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean plasma alpha-ANP concentration of 22 measurements was 120.1 +/- 79.8 pg/ml (normal 31.7 +/- 12.0, mean +/- SD).

The following information was collected for each ICU patient on admission, then daily, and on ICU discharge: demographic data, procedures, monitors used, laboratory tests, complications, outcome, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score as a measure of acuity. In our study, this information was used as a first step in an attempt to define categories of patients who might benefit most from intensive care and those who would not. From September 1, 1987 to March 1, 1989, 1,062 patients were admitted to the surgical ICU (SICU). Otorhinolaryngology (ENT) patients with major head and neck resections, routinely admitted to the SICU, were compared with those from other surgical services. The ENT patients had the lowest mean admission APACHE II (6.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 11.4 +/- 0.3), lowest mean daily APACHE II (7.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 13.2 +/- 0.1), lowest percent of ventilated patients (7.6% vs. 39.4%) and ventilator days (18.9% vs. 64.6%), and had the least monitoring by central venous catheters (20.9% vs. 57.1%) or pulmonary artery catheters (0.9% vs. 29.8%) (p less than .0001 for all of above). They also had the shortest mean ICU stay (1.2 +/- 0.1 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.2 days, p less than .05).

However, the effect of prolonged treatment with enprostil on the gastrin profile is unknown. The aim of this study was to compare serum gastrin levels over a 24-hr period before (day 0) and on the last day (day 14) of a two-week course of enprostil (35 micrograms twice a day). Nine healthy volunteers (four women and five men), ages 29 +/- 5 years (range 23-39) were studied twice during a 24-hr period. Serum gastrin was measured at 30-min intervals during the day and at 2-hr intervals during the night. Enprostil (35 micrograms) was taken after basal gastrin serum measurement at 8:00 AM and PM. Standardized meals were ingested at 8:30 AM, 12:30 PM, and 8:30 PM. The postprandial integrated serum gastrin response was calculated after the three meals (4-hr period). Fasting serum gastrin levels were similar for the two periods. Integrated postprandial gastrin response was significantly inhibited after breakfast and dinner (P less than 0.001). Average results are expressed as mean +/- SEM (pmol/min/liter). During the night, gastrin levels were significantly decreased by enprostil. After 14 days, the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, which induces an increase of gastrin release with other antisecretory drugs, remained counterbalanced by the antigastrin properties of enprostil.\r"

  ".W": "GRF promotes follicular maturation and ovulation when administered with FSH in the treatment of infertility. Such actions could be mediated by stimulation of GH secretion and insulin-like growth factor I production, but the known actions of the structurally related hormone, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), on granulosa cell function suggested that GRF may also act directly on the ovary to stimulate follicular development. Radioligand binding and activation studies, performed in granulosa cells from immature estrogen-treated rats, revealed a common receptor for VIP and rat (r) GRF in the ovary. Specific binding of [125I]VIP to granulosa cells was saturable and dependent on time and temperature. The relative potencies of VIP-related peptides for inhibition of radioligand binding were: VIP greater than rGRF greater than peptide histidine isoleucinamide greater than [His1,Nle27] human GRF(1-32)NH2 greater than secretin. In binding studies with the potent GRF agonist, [125I] [His1,Nle27]GRF(1-32)NH2, relative potencies were: rGRF(1-43)OH greater than [His1,Nle27]human GRF(1-32)NH2 greater than VIP greater than peptide histidine isoleucinamide greater than secretin. Glucagon and gastric inhibitory peptide, other peptides of the glucagon superfamily, and unrelated peptides including CRF and beta-endorphin, did not inhibit binding of either radioligand to ovarian receptors. In cultured granulosa cells, rGRF and VIP stimulated cAMP formation, consistent with coupling of their receptors to the adenylate cyclase system, and potentiated FSH-induced cAMP production. Both peptides also amplified FSH-induced progesterone biosynthesis, aromatase activity, and LH receptor formation. These observations demonstrate that rGRF is a potent cAMP-mediated agonist in the rat ovary and acts on a common VIP/GRF receptor in maturing granulosa cells. It is likely that the potentiating effect of administered GRF on gonadotropin-stimulated follicular development in vivo is in part mediated by direct actions of the peptide on the VIP/GRF receptor. Also, since GRF is present in the gonads, it is possible that the locally-produced peptide promotes follicular maturation by paracrine modulation of the stimulatory action of FSH on granulosa cell function.\r"

  ".U": "91031244\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a potent ACTH secretagogue which activates the release of hypothalamic CRF but is unable to cross the blood brain barrier. Recently, it was reported that IL-1 beta, instilled directly into the hypothalamic median eminence (ME), rapidly induced ACTH secretion. Thus, due to the lack of a blood brain barrier the ME appears to be a site whereby iv IL-1 beta can access the brain to stimulate CRF and, consequently, ACTH secretion. To evaluate the role of central catecholamines in this process, 250 g male rats were lesioned with 6-hydroxy-dopamine instilled into the lateral ventricle. Ten days later, rats received recombinant h-IL-1 beta (10 or 30 ng) into the ME and blood was sampled via indwelling jugular cannulae. The ACTH response to IL-1 beta, 30 ng, was reduced by approximately 50% in the lesioned rats (P = 0.05), and it was abolished in those receiving IL-1 beta, 10 ng (P less than 0.05). Moreover, in rats given iv IL-1 beta (1 microgram), 6-hydroxy-dopamine significantly reduced the ACTH response by more than 50% (P less than 0.001). To determine the effect of acute epinephrine depletion, 2,3 dichloro-alpha-methylbenzylamine (DCMB, 60 mg/kg BW) and SKF64139 (SKF) (100 mg/kg BW), inhibitors of the enzyme which converts norepinephrine to epinephrine, were administered ip 4 h before intra-ME IL-1 beta (30 ng). DCMB reduced the ACTH response by 80% and SKF reduced it to its own baseline. LY 10853, which acutely depletes both norepinephrine and epinephrine, also reduced the ACTH response by 80%. Because of the reported capacities of DCMB and SKF to block alpha 2 adrenoreceptors in vitro, yohimbine, an alpha 2 receptor antagonist, was studied. Intra-ME yohimbine failed to inhibit the ACTH response to intra-ME IL-1 beta. In contrast, a significant (P less than 0.01) dose-dependent reduction in the ACTH response to intra-ME IL-1 beta (30 ng) was observed in rats pretreated with either a nonselective alpha or beta adrenoreceptor antagonist (phentolamine, 2-40 micrograms or propranolol, 2-20 micrograms, respectively, into the ME). In contrast, intra-ME phentolamine, 20 micrograms, failed to reduce the ACTH response to iv CRF, 1 microgram/kg BW. Thus, the secretion of ACTH stimulated by the action of IL-1 beta at the ME depends, in part, on the local secretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine interacting with both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors.\r"

Adult animals were maintained either under long or short days (14:10D or 6L:18D, respectively) and given single, daily ip injections of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (25 mg/kg BW); control animals received injections of saline. As expected, the testes of the short-day controls had completely regressed to a prepubertal condition within 6 weeks, a change that was associated with significantly reduced mean plasma gonadotropin levels. In contrast, the NMDA-treated hamsters from both the long-day and short-day groups, as well as the long-day controls, all maintained large testes and elevated plasma gonadotropin levels, although plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) was partially suppressed in the short-day group. In a second experiment which lasted 2 weeks, short-day hamsters with completely regressed testes were either transferred to long days, maintained further on short days, or maintained on short days and given a daily ip injection of NMDA (25 mg/kg BW). The short-term exposure to long days caused an expected increase in plasma and pituitary concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, pituitary LH, and testicular weight. Similar, but even more marked, changes were observed in the short-day hamsters that were treated with NMDA, including significant increases in plasma LH and serum testosterone concentrations. Moreover, histological examination revealed that the recrudescing testes from this latter group already contained mature spermatocytes and in some individuals even spermatozoa. These results demonstrate that NMDA receptors may play a pivotal role in both the termination and onset of the breeding season in photoperiodic species.\r"

  ".W": "Use of reverse hemolytic plaque assays revealed that, as in the rat, bovine somatotropes are functionally heterogeneous with respect to regulated GH release. Uniquely, this heterogeneity is manifested by the appearance of a distinct subpopulation of GH cells that release hormone only in the presence of the hypothalamic secretagogues GRF and/or TRH. Although these cells did not release GH in the absence of stimulatory agents, immunocytochemical detection of GH demonstrated these cells were capable of hormone storage. The relative abundance of silent somatotropes varied according to the hypothalamic secretagogue applied to the culture (GRF and/or TRH) and the physiologic state of the tissue donor. In cell cultures obtained from castrated males, 4.2 +/- 1.2%, 3.0 +/- 0.7%, and 6.8 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- SEM; n = 14) of all pituitary cells were induced to release detectable amounts of GH by GRF, TRH, and GRF/TRH, respectively. When pituitary cells obtained from gonad-intact males (n = 4) and females (n = 4) were tested, only incubation with GRF (14.1 +/- 2.5%; 6.9 +/- 2.3%, respectively) and GRF/TRH (15.2 +/- 2.4%; 9.2 +/- 2.6%, respectively) stimulated a significant population of these silent cells. A combined analysis of the proportion of GH secretors and the relative amount of hormone released per cell revealed that a substantial fraction of the GH secreted in vitro after stimulation is attributable to the recruitment of silent somatotropes into the secretory pool. Taken together, these results reveal the existence of a unique form of GH cell heterogeneity--the silent somatotrope. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that this somatotrope population could provide a cellular basis for the readily releasable pool of GH in the bovine pituitary.\r"

  ".W": "Characterization of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) and their pituitary regulation were investigated in intact and hypophysectomized (HX) pregnant and nonpregnant mice. Serum samples were obtained from pregnant mice killed on days 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 18 of gestation and fetal mice killed on day 18 of gestation. Some animals were HX or sham operated (SH) on days 9, 11, and 14 of gestation; HX and SH control animals were killed 3 days post surgery. Identification and relative quantities of IGFBPs were determined by Western ligand blotting (WLB) of whole serum, or immunoprecipitated and/or deglycosylated serum, using [125I]IGF-II as the ligand. Serum IGF-I and -II concentrations were determined in both HX and SH day 14 pregnant, nonpregnant, and day 18 fetal mouse sera. WLB analysis of nonpregnant mouse serum demonstrated IGFBPs with apparent Mr of approximately 45-40, 31-27, and 24 K. The 45-40 K IGFBPs appeared to be the mouse equivalent of IGFBP-3, and one of the 31-27 K IGFBPs appeared to be IGFBP-2. The other IGFBPs present are not yet fully identified. During pregnancy, the amount of IGFBP-3 present in serum (as measured by WLB) gradually decreased to 42%, 17%, and 10% of virgin levels on days 5, 8, and 10 of gestation. The amount of IGFBP-3 present in pregnant serum after day 10 of gestation was not measurable by scanning laser densitometry. Additionally, an IGFBP of approximately 27 K appeared during gestation; after treatment with Endoglycosidase F, this IGFBP decreased to 24 K. The major IGFBP in fetal serum appeared to be IGFBP-2, with lesser amounts of IGFBP-3 and the 27 and 24 K IGFBPs. Hypophysectomy significantly decreased IGFBP-3, IGF-I, and IGF-II in nonpregnant mouse serum, increased the amount of IGFBP2 found in pregnant mouse serum, and had no effect on IGF-I or -II concentration in day 14 pregnant mouse serum. Incubation of nonpregnant serum with late (day 17) pregnant serum for 5 h at 37 C, decreased the amount of IGFBP-3 (as measured by WLB) in the mixed sample to 93% of the amount present in the nonmixed sample. Iodinated recombinant IGFBP-3 ([125I]human (h)IGFBP-3) was incubated with different mouse serum samples, and proteolytic fragments were visualized after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Using ligand blotting and immunoprecipitation we have characterized the insulin like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) produced by cultured porcine granulosa cells. Ligand blot analysis of granulosa cell conditioned medium revealed 5 bands of IGF binding activity with apparent molecular sizes of 44, 40, 34, 29, and 22 kilodaltons (kDa). The 40-44 kDa bands of granulosa- conditioned medium were identified by immunoprecipitation with an antibody to porcine IGFBP-3, the acid-stable subunit of the 150 kDa GH-dependent serum IGFBP complex. The 34 kDa band was immunoprecipitated by an antibody to the rat IGFBP-2, the major IGFBP found in fetal rat serum and in BRL-3A cell cultures. To date we have been unable to immunoprecipitate the 29 and 22 kDa bands with any of the antibodies tested including a panel of monoclonal antibodies to human IGFBP-1, the amniotic fluid IGFBP. The pattern of secretion varied with size of the follicles from which granulosa cells were obtained and the culture conditions. With cells from small (2-4 mm) follicles, short term cultures secreted mainly IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-2, while IGFBP-2 and the 29 and 22 kDa bands were pronounced in longer term cultures. In short term culture, granulosa cells from medium sized (4-6 mm) porcine follicles produced IGFBPs in substantially greater amounts than did those from small (1-3 mm) follicles, but exhibited comparable band patterns. The production of IGFBPs was inhibited by cycloheximide. IGFBP production by granulosa cells in culture was regulated by hormones and growth factors. The most striking effects were the inhibition of IGFBP-3 secretion by transforming growth factor beta and FSH. In contrast, IGFBP-3 levels were enhanced by epidermal growth factor. The IGFBPs produced by cultured porcine granulosa cells are identical in size and immunoreactivity to those previously found in porcine follicular fluid. Thus, follicular cells may be the source of follicular fluid IGFBPs. The IGFBPs may be important modulators of the IGF autocrine/paracrine system in the ovary.\r"

  ".W": "Gonadotropin-induced ovulation is associated with oocyte maturation and preovulatory increases of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) expression. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), an angiogenic factor found in many organs including the ovary, modulates steroidogenesis in granulosa cells and increases PA activity in endothelial cells. Here studies were performed to examine the possible roles of bFGF as an intragonadal regulator of tPA expression and oocyte maturation. In cultured granulosa cells, bFGF caused a time-dependent (onset at 24 h) and dose-dependent (ED50 = 0.6 nM) increase (up to 5-fold) in tPA enzyme activity as measured by the fibrin overlay technique. Northern blot hybridization also revealed that treatment of cells with bFGF (2 nM) increased the level of the 22S tPA messenger RNA. Slot blot analysis indicated that the effects of bFGF were time dependent and dose dependent; tPA message levels increase before tPA activity levels. bFGF (0.6 nM) also significantly increased granulosa cell cAMP production in both the absence and presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In follicle-enclosed oocytes incubated for 24 h in media with or without increasing concentrations of LH or bFGF, germinal vesicle breakdown was observed in only 1.6% of controls, but 85% of LH (1 microgram/ml)-treated oocytes underwent maturation. Likewise, bFGF induced germinal vesicle breakdown (10-80%) over a dose range of 0.6 to 333 nM. In the same follicles, bFGF, like LH, also stimulated prostaglandin E production. These results, coupled with the identification of bFGF in growing follicles, suggest that bFGF acts as an intraovarian inducer of granulosa cell tPA gene expression and oocyte maturation.\r"

  ".U": "91031269\r", 
  ".W": "A pulsatile pattern of hypothalamic GnRH stimulation is necessary for the maintenance of pituitary LH and FSH secretion, with continuous GnRH leading to a decrement in response. Although the physiological pattern of free alpha-subunit secretion closely mimics that of LH, several reports have indicated that free alpha-subunit is not desensitized by continuous GnRH stimulation. To explore the basis of this phenomenon, we have evaluated the responses of all three gonadotrope secretory products to carefully coordinated administration of pulsatile and continuous GnRH in a dispersed rat pituitary perifusion system. Sensitivities (ED50) to GnRH fell within a narrow range for free alpha-subunit (11.5 nM), LH (12.9 nM), and FSH (17.3 nM), although a greater mass of LH than free alpha-subunit or FSH was released after each pulse of GnRH. The response to a standard GnRH pulse (10 nM) administered every 15, 30, or 120 min for 9 h was very stable, with no evidence of priming, summation, or loss of response. LH, FSH, and free alpha-subunit did, however, show significantly (P less than 0.05) higher pulse amplitude with longer interpulse intervals. In contrast to previous observations in vivo, the three gonadotrope secretory products showed parallel desensitization in response to continuous infusions of GnRH. This loss of response was significant (P less than 0.05) after exposure to as little as 0.1 (FSH) to 0.5 nM (LH and alpha-subunit) GnRH for 2 h or to higher concentrations of GnRH (10 nM) for as little as 15 min (LH, FSH, and alpha-subunit). These concentrations and durations of GnRH stimulation are within the range of values measured in vivo. We conclude that 1) free alpha-subunit, LH, and FSH have similar concentration and frequency responses to pulsatile GnRH, although the absolute amount of hormone released is different for each secretory product; 2) the frequency of pulsatile GnRH stimulation can function as an independent determinant of secretion for each of the three products; and 3) in contrast to observations in vivo, free alpha-subunit, LH, and FSH secretion desensitize similarly after exposure to concentrations or durations of GnRH that may occur in vivo. These observations raise the possibility that desensitization plays a role in the physiological regulation of gonadotrope secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of steady state levels of plasma membrane receptors for GnRH is the arithmetic result of processes that contribute to the appearance of receptors (synthesis, recycling, and unmasking) less those that contribute to the loss of receptors (degradation, internalization, and inactivation). We have adapted the density shift technique to evaluate specifically the rate of synthesis of GnRH receptors in rat pituitary cell cultures. Recently, it has been shown that inhibin can decrease the steady state levels of GnRH receptors in rat pituitary cell cultures and can block homologous up-regulation of GnRH receptors. In the present study we have evaluated the ability of purified inhibin to affect the synthesis rate of GnRH receptors under basal conditions and after exposure of cultured gonadotropes (from female weanling rats) to GnRH. Cells were exposed to inhibin alone (4 or 12 ng/ml) or to GnRH (10(-10) M) plus inhibin (0.4, 4, or 12 ng/ml) in the presence of densely labeled amino acids. GnRH was administered as a 20-min pulse, but inhibin treatment was continued for up to 2 days. After these treatments, GnRH receptors were covalently linked to a radio-labeled photoaffinity probe (125I- Tyr5-[azido-benzoyl-D-Lys6] GnRH) and solubilized with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Newly synthesized GnRH receptors (those that had incorporated the dense amino acids) were separated from previously synthesized receptors (those containing normal amino acids) by velocity sedimentation through sucrose gradients (O-20% sucrose, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0; centrifuged at 156,000 x g for 24 h). After velocity sedimentation, gradients were fractionated, and the radioactivity in each fraction was quantified. Treatment with inhibin alone had no effect on the synthesis rate of GnRH receptors compared to that of control cultures (t1/2, 23.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 23.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 22.9 +/- 0.9 h for control, 4 ng/ml inhibin, and 12 ng/ml inhibin, respectively). In contrast, inhibin blocked the stimulation of homologous receptor synthesis by GnRH in a dose-dependent manner (t1/2, 12.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 14.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 19.2 +/- 1.5 vs. 20.0 +/- 2.9 h for GnRH alone and GnRH plus 0.4, 4, or 12 ng/ml inhibin, respectively). These data indicate that in rat pituitary cell cultures, inhibin does not decrease basal levels of GnRH receptors by affecting the synthesis rate of receptors, but prevents up-regulation of GnRH receptors by blocking stimulation of GnRH receptor synthesis by homologous hormone.\r"

Under these conditions, LH release and GnRH receptor number remained unchanged after repeated pulses of 1 nM GnRM, whereas PKC (measured both enzymatically and by radioligand assay) showed an initial increase in kinase activity after the first pulse of GnRH (approximately 2-fold), followed by down-regulation of PKC activity with subsequent pulses of the releasing hormone. It was also observed that the GnRH-stimulated down-regulation of PKC was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium, which was not the case for the initial up-regulation of PKC. These findings are consistent with a modulating role of the GnRH receptor on PKC activity through a Ca2(+)-dependent process. This study also provides further evidence that GnRH-stimulated LH release and PKC activity can be uncoupled.\r"

The differentiation of equine preovulatory follicles with respect to steroidogenic capacity and responsiveness to equine gonadotropins was studied by culturing pieces of follicle wall (FW = theca + attached granulosa cells) from preovulatory follicles isolated during late diestrus (day 14 of cycle, n = 5 mares), early estrus (1st-2nd day of estrus, n = 6) or late estrus (4th or 5th day of estrus, n = 6). FW was cultured with or without equine LH, FSH, LH + FSH, or CG (10 or 100 ng/ml) and medium was collected and replaced at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of culture. Follicular fluid from presumptive ovulatory follicles and medium from FW cultures were assayed for progesterone, androstenedione, and estradiol-17 beta. The cumulative secretion of all three steroids after 72 h of culture was significantly lower in FW isolated during late diestrus (P less than 0.05) as compared with early or late estrus. Maximal progesterone secretion was observed with FW from late estrus whereas maximal androstenedione and estradiol secretion in vitro occurred with FW from early estrus. In contrast to results obtained in vitro, concentrations of progesterone in follicular fluid were not different among stages of follicular development, and concentrations of androstenedione and estradiol in follicular fluid were maximal in late estrous follicles. Equine gonadotropins had their greatest stimulatory effect on steroidogenesis with FW obtained during late diestrus. As compared with controls, the addition of LH, FSH, or LH + FSH (100 ng/ml) increased progesterone secretion by FW from late diestrus (48x, 64x, and 58x, respectively, P less than 0.01), early estrus (24x, 32x, and 36x, P less than 0.01) and late estrus (9x, 9x, and 9x, P less than 0.01). Equine LH and FSH also increased androstenedione secretion by follicles obtained during diestrus and estrus. In contrast, estradiol secretion showed a more rapid loss in responsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation, with both LH and FSH stimulating estradiol secretion by FW from late diestrous follicles (P less than 0.01), but neither stimulating FW from early or late estrous follicles. Overall, eCG was a less potent stimulator of steroidogenesis in vitro than LH and FSH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Stretching of atrial myocytes stimulates atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion, but the cellular processes linking mechanical distention to ANP release are unknown. We studied whether or not protein kinase C activation by phorbol ester affects atrial stretch-induced ANP secretion using the modified perfused rat heart preparation that enabled stepwise distention of the right atrium as an experimental model for stretch-stimulated ANP release. The increase in right atrial pressure (2.65 +/- 0.13 mm Hg) was accompanied by an increase in the perfusate immunoreactive ANP (IR-ANP) concentration (from 8.3 +/- 1.1 ng/5 min to 13.9 +/- 2.0 ng/5 min, P less than 0.05, n = 14). During stretch, a slight inotropic response was observed, while heart rate and perfusion pressure remained unchanged. Increase in right atrial pressure in the presence of a phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), known to stimulate protein kinase C activity in heart cells, resulted in a significantly greater increase in the perfusate IR-ANP concentration than after vehicle infusion. The calculated ANP increase corresponding to the 2 mm Hg increase in the right atrial pressure was 1.52-fold in the control group and 1.84-fold when 10 nM TPA was infused (P less than 0.05). Infusion of TPA at a dose of 24 nM further increased the stretch-induced ANP release by causing 2.22-fold (P less than 0.01) increase in IR-ANP secretion. As judged by gel filtration chromatography, abnormal release of the large mol wt stored ANP could not account for the secretory response to phorbol ester. Additionally, a phorbol ester analog, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, which is incapable of binding to and activating protein kinase C, was inactive as an ANP secretagogue. In contrast, drugs known to increase the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ in myocytes, Bay K8644 (3 and 6 microns) and forskolin (0.14 microM), significantly inhibited the stretch-stimulated ANP release. This study shows that phorbol ester enhances atrial stretch-stimulated ANP secretion from the isolated perfused heart, suggesting that protein kinase C activity is positively coupled to the stretch-induced ANP release. The results further demonstrate the negative effect of increase in intracellular Ca2+ on stretch-induced ANP release.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the role of extracellular Ca2+ in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] rapid stimulation of intestinal Ca2+ transport (termed transcaltachia) in the perfused duodenal of vitamin D-replete chicks. The carboxylic ionophore ionomycin (2 microM) was found to stimulate 45Ca2+ transport from the lumen to the vascular effluent to the same extent as physiological levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3. The increase in duodenal 45Ca2+ transport caused by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was dependent on the presence of medium Ca2+, since it was abolished by prior addition of EGTA and was restored upon the addition of Ca2+. Depolarization of the basal lateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells with 70 mM K+ caused a rapid increase in 45Ca2+ transport (30% above control values within 2 min and 250% after 20 min of vascular perfusion). The rise was also abolished by prior addition of EGTA. Intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) were measured in isolated duodenal cells from vitamin D-replete chicks using the fluorescent dye fura 2. A 1-min incubation with physiological concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (130 pM) caused an increase in [Ca2+]i from a basal level of 168 +/- 23 nM to 363 +/- 44 nM. Pretreatment of intestinal epithelial cells with the protein kinase-C activator tetradeconyl-phorbol acetate (100 nM) or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (10 microM), both shown to induce acute stimulation of intestinal 45Ca2+ transport in the perfused duodenum, also mimicked the stimulatory effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on [Ca2+]i. The increase in [Ca2+]i elicited by the 1,25-(OH)2D3 was due to Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium, since it was blocked by the Ca2+ chelator EGTA (5 mM) and the Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine (1 microM). These results suggest that the acute effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on duodenal 45Ca2+ transport are triggered by the influx of Ca2+ through voltage-operated Ca2+ channels and that both protein kinase-C and protein kinase-A play an important role in mediating or modulating 1,25-(OH)2D3 effects on transcaltachia.\r"

TRH and TRH-Gly immunoreactivities were detectable in almost all tissues studied. TRH was distributed mainly in neural tissues, with the highest mean concentration (126 pg/mg tissue) in hypothalamus. In extra-neural tissues, mean TRH levels ranged from 0.6-4.8 pg/mg tissue; the mean serum concentration was 12.4 pg/ml. In contrast to the distribution of TRH, relatively higher mean TRH-Gly concentrations were observed in serum (76.5 pg/ml) and in extraneural tissues, including prostate (83.3 pg/mg tissue), spleen (19.0 pg/mg), adrenal (16.2 pg/mg), kidney (13.3 pg/mg), and gastrointestinal tract (6.3-19.8 pg/mg). Among brain tissues, the TRH-Gly concentration was highest in pituitary gland (13.1 pg/mg). The mean ratio of TRH-Gly/TRH concentrations was less than 1 in neural tissues and pancreas. The lowest ratio (0.04) was observed in hypothalamus, and the highest ratio (66) in prostate gland. Assuming that tissue TRH-Gly levels reflect TRH synthesis, these results suggest that 1) the processing of TRH-Gly to TRH varies among tissues, 2) TRH-Gly to TRH conversion occurs most efficiently in neural tissues, and 3) TRH-Gly to TRH conversion may be a rate-limiting step in TRH biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to determine the parameters of pulsatile gonadotropin secretion in the adult male rat that are regulated by the suppressive feedback influences provided by factors originating in the Leydig cells or by endogenous inhibin, or both. This was achieved by examining the changes in the secretion parameters of FSH and LH that result from selectively destroying the Leydig cells using the toxicant ethane dimethane sulfonate (EDS) or passively immunoneutralizing endogenous inhibin using high-titer anti alpha-inhibin subunit serum, or both. Both FSH and LH were secreted in a pulsatile manner in intact male rats as determined using two different pulse-detection methods. Destruction of the Leydig cells with EDS 6 days before sampling significantly increased basal FSH secretion without affecting pulsatile FSH secretion. Injection of anti-inhibin serum into intact (vehicle treated) males 18 h before sampling produced no observable alteration in any parameter of FSH secretion. Either administration of anti-inhibin serum or castration of rats previously treated with EDS induced further significant, selective increases in the basal parameters of FSH secretion, raising mean FSH to levels comparable to those observed in 6-day castrate rats. When examined individually, however, the parameters of mean trough and peak FSH level and mean pulse amplitude remained significantly higher in the 6-day castrate males. In sharp contrast to the selective effects on basal FSH, destruction of the Leydig cells with EDS dramatically elevated all parameters of LH secretion to levels comparable to those observed in similarly timed castrate rats. Neither immunoneutralization of endogenous inhibin nor castration of EDS-treated rats 18 h before sampling caused any further alteration in any parameter of LH secretion. The results from these studies demonstrate that the Leydig cell provides all of the suppressive influence of the testes on LH secretion and a major portion of the suppressive influence over FSH secretion. This influence is exerted through a suppression of all parameters of LH secretion, but through a selective suppression of basal FSH secretion parameters. Collectively, the results suggest that the Leydig cell-derived influences suppress those parameters of gonadotropin secretion that are mediated by LHRH, acting, at least in part, through a suppression of pituitary sensitivity to LHRH. In the absence of the Leydig cells, endogenous inhibin can be demonstrated to also suppress basal FSH secretion in the adult male rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF) has been demonstrated within the central nervous system (CNS), where it has been implicated in the regulation of blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte balance. To explore the effect of acute plasma vol expansion on the activation of CNS ANF, changes in ANF levels of CSF drawn from the cisterna magna of anesthetized sheep were measured. Intravenous infusions of Dextran (10 ml/kg body wt, n = 7) or control (total vol 7.5 ml Dextran, n = 7) were administered over 30 min. Compared to control experiments, plasma vol expansion resulted in a 3-fold increase of central venous pressure (P = 0.002), a 25% increase in mean arterial pressure (P = 0.011), and a 20% reduction in packed red cell volume (P = 0.024). Accompanying these hemodynamic changes, plasma ANF concentrations doubled (17.0 +/- 3.0-41.0 +/- 7.8 pmol/liter at 60 min vs. 20.0 +/- 4.7-19.3 +/- 3.6 pmol/liter in controls) and remained elevated for 4 h, whereas CSF ANF concentrations showed a transient 3-fold increase (2.1 +/- 0.3-6.6 +/- 1.9 pmol/liter at 120 min vs. 2.5 +/- 0.5-3.8 +/- 0.7 pmol/liter in controls). The maximum increments of both plasma and CSF ANF were statistically significant (P = 0.002 and 0.03, respectively). Basal CSF levels were approximately 1/10 those in plasma, and no correlation was seen in either basal plasma and CSF levels, or the maximum increments of plasma and CSF ANF concentrations. In vol-expanded sheep, plasma cyclic GMP concentrations tended to increase, although not significantly different from controls, while CSF cyclic GMP was similar to controls throughout the experiments. The entry of ANF to cisterna magna CSF was studied in five additional anesthetized sheep. Infusion iv of ileu rat ANP (50 ng/kg.min over 60 min) raised plasma ANF levels 30-fold, but CSF ANF concentrations did not change. These experiments show that plasma vol expansion in sheep, in addition to stimulating cardiac ANF secretion, induces an increase in CSF ANF, which cannot be accounted for by transfer of ANF from blood into CSF.\r"

This paper demonstrates that the steady state c-jun mRNA level in the avian oviduct is markedly decreased to 50% of control values within 30 minutes after estrogen injection into the animals. In the avian liver, the level is rapidly increased over 10 fold. Nuclear run-off transcription analysis demonstrates that the decrease in the c-jun mRNA levels in the avian oviduct occurs at least in part at the level of transcription. These changes are reproducible in repeat experiments. This response in the avian oviduct is unique since 1) it is the first demonstration of a steroid effect on c-jun expression in any animal system, 2) the changes in c-jun mRNA occur much more rapidly than most steroid responsive genes, and 3) it is the rare demonstration of an estrogen inhibition of the expression of a gene. A role for the c-jun proto-oncogene as an early regulatory gene in the cascade model for steroid action is proposed.\r"

We have demonstrated that a congener of ANP, auriculin B (ANP4-28), was present in long term monolayer cultures of neonatal rat hypothalamic neurons. In addition, forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX) augmented the cellular content of auriculin B in a dose dependent manner. Thus, cyclic AMP may act as an intracellular signal for modulating the functional development of hypothalamic immunoreactive (ir) ANP producing neurons. Furthermore, our data suggest that the form of ANP released from these cultures, following either forskolin treatment alone or forskolin treatment followed by acute high potassium depolarisation, was atriopeptin III (ANP5-28). Thus atriopeptin III, rather than auriculin B, may represent the endogenous ligand for ANP receptors in the central nervous system.\r"

To determine whether P can alter the activation of LHRH neurons, 1) intact female rats were treated with the P antagonist RU486 (5 mg) at 1230 h on proestrus and killed at specified times during the afternoon and evening for comparison of plasma LH levels and cFos expression in LHRH neurons with untreated proestrous rats. RU486 treatment greatly reduced both the magnitude of the LH surge and the degree of cFos induction (numbers of cells expressing cFos and intensity of cFos staining) in LHRH neurons during proestrus. 2) Ovariectomized (OVX) rats were primed with estradiol benzoate (EB, 1 microgram) and then were treated with EB alone (50 microgram) or EB plus P (5 mg). Treatment with EB without P resulted in significantly lower peak LH levels and a reduced cFos response in LHRH neurons than the EB-P treated rats. These data suggest that the actions of P eventuate in an enhanced activation of LHRH neurons that may be responsible for the increased magnitude of the LH surge.\r"

Linkage studies using Bf, HLA serologic, and DNA markers by three independent investigators, one from Los Angeles and two from Berlin, have localized the JME locus to the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p). Because members of the same JME family have the same JME phenotype of childhood absence epilepsy, epilepsy with grand mal (GTCS) seizures, or early childhood myoclonic epilepsy (ECME), our observations give evidence for a single-locus etiology in 6p for JME and for at least some of the childhood absence seizures, epilepsy with grand mal (GTCS) seizures, and ECME. Studies should now address whether locus heterogeneity exists within childhood absence epilepsy, epilepsy with grand mal (GTCS) seizures, or ECME. Markers linked to JME (Bf, HLA serologic, and DNA markers in the DQ region) can be used to resolve etiologic heterogeneity. Using such markers, both linked and unlinked forms of phenotypes that are clinically indistinguishable may be detected and provide evidence for etiologic heterogeneity. Studies should also concentrate on narrowing the JME locus to 2 to 3 cm by screening families with recombinant events using RFLPs, candidate genes, and new expressed sequences on chromosome 6.\r"

The diagnosis and treatment of these syndromes has been enhanced by the use of modern science and technology. Epidemiologic studies have changed our approach to febrile convulsions. This developmental seizure disorder is benign and self-limited. We have been forced to think carefully about threshold, therapy, and whether other seizures in childhood may be equally benign. This framework of developmental specificity can also be applied to West syndrome, especially with respect to neurophysiology, neurochemistry, neuroimaging, and epidemiology--the types of seizures, clustering, variations associated with sleep, PET scans, and therapy. Rasmussen's syndrome and other unilateral developmental epilepsies are progressive but remain confined to a single hemisphere. However, they usually are devastating to global neurologic function. They are models for examining the impact of epilepsy in one pathologic hemisphere on the function of the entire brain. Current therapy for this condition is hemispherectomy. Recovery of function after this major surgery is striking and provides clues to brain organization. The analysis of these three syndromes provides windows on the dynamic, changing central nervous system of the child and may lead to better understanding and therapy for other seizure disorders.\r"

Indolent low-grade gliomas may be associated with a long-standing seizure disorder refractory to medical treatment. Surgical resection of the neoplasm and the epileptogenic area may render patients seizure-free. Removal of the tumor alone may also be associated with an excellent survival rate and surgical outcome. Conventional neurosurgical procedures are restricted in patients with tumors that are deep-seated lesions or involve functional cerebral cortex. Computer-assisted stereotactic surgical procedures have been developed for biopsy and resection of intra-axial brain-mass lesions. Stereotactic tumor resection may allow pathological determination of intracranial lesions and produce a worthwhile reduction in seizure activity in some patients with intractable partial epilepsy.\r"

Findings were compared with 8 normal ovulatory controls. Folliculogenesis on CC therapy, based on our data, was 78%; however, only 44% ovulated spontaneously, 34% required hCG for follicle rupture. There were no apparent hormonal indicators to predict responders from nonresponders. The absence of an LH surge in the presence of follicles and sustained high E2 concentrations in 34% of patients may be associated with a decreased E2 sensitivity at the hypothalamic-pituitary level. Ultrasound easily identified patients who responded to CC with folliculogenesis but did not initiate an LH surge. Follicle rupture was achieved promptly by hCG administration.\r"

Protocol 2 consisted of daily GnRH-a beginning in the midluteal phase. Stimulation with 150 IU hMG commenced after pituitary down regulation and ovarian suppression were achieved. Human menopausal gonadotropin was continued in both protocols until adequate follicular development and serum estradiol concentrations were obtained. Protocol 2 patients reached egg retrieval significantly more often (87%) than Protocol 1 patients (61%), but the mean number of mature eggs retrieved and the pregnancy rate per retrieval were not significantly different between the two groups.\r"

The mitotic index (MI) of follicular granulosa cells and the proportion of recruitable healthy follicles were analyzed 4 to 5 days after hMG injection, the findings being compared with those in unstimulated ovaries from 22 normally cycling patients.

The granulosa cell MI was highly stimulated by hMG when administered in late-luteal or early-follicular phases; however, no granulosa cell MI stimulation was noted when hMG was administered in the midfollicular or late-follicular phases. The progressive abolition of the ability of hMG to stimulate follicular growth as ovulation approaches supports the existence of an inhibitory activity (possibly ovarian) designed to suppress the selection and the maturation of the less developed antral follicles from the midfollicular phase of the spontaneous human menstrual cycle.\r"

We retrospectively studied 101 patients treated with the GnRH-a leuprolide acetate, begun in the luteal phase of the prior menstrual cycle and continued until the day of hCG administration. On the day of hCG, 72 patients had P less than 0.9 ng/mL and 29 had less than or equal to 0.9 ng/mL. Patients in the high P group had a significantly greater estradiol level on the day of hCG.

Along with increased oocyte number, greatly increased estradiol (E2) levels have been found. We sought to determine the clinical effect of very high E2 levels on the outcome of IVF cycles. Estradiol levels were measured in 141 patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with leuprolide acetate and human menopausal gonadotropin for IVF. Whereas the number of oocytes recovered and fertilized and the number of embryos available for cryopreservation were directly proportional to the E2 level, the fertilization rate and embryo cleavage rates were unrelated to the E2 level. When the patients were grouped in thirds according to E2 levels, pregnancy rate (PR) was highest in the patients with the highest E2 levels (E2 greater than 2,777 pg/mL, PR = 37%). One mild, one moderate, and one severe case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome occurred in patients with E2 greater than or equal to 3,000 pg/mL (n = 21), but in general, high E2 levels were attained with few complications. We conclude that high E2 levels are not detrimental to the pregnancy outcome of IVF. Our experience further suggests that cycles with E2 levels of less than or equal to 5,000 pg/mL need not be canceled and can proceed to oocyte recovery and embryo transfer.\r"

Histochemical activity of delta 5,3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was demonstrated in samples of cumulus obtained from 62 oocytes recovered from 24 women. Patients were treated with clomiphene citrate in combination with human menopausal gonadotropins and human chorionic gonadotropin injections. The cumulus was found to contain small and large cell types. Small cells possessed more delta 5,3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity predominantly in the area near the oocyte. Cytoplasmic vacuolation has been noted in large, pale cells with moderate or low enzyme activity. The most active cells were predominant in cumulus from which oocytes were fertilized. Significant differences have been found between high and low delta 5,3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity of cumulus cells from mature oocyte-corona-cumulus complexes leading to a successful fertilization and cleavage of oocytes and between groups with different histochemical activity when aspirated complexes were scored immature and the IVF of oocytes has failed.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation is decreased in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It is not known whether this decrease is due to a primary defect in the oxidative pathway or is secondary to impaired glucose transport and/or phosphorylation. To address this issue, glucose oxidation was measured under steady-state conditions at low (approximately 270 pmol) and high (approximately 17 mumol) insulin concentrations in seven patients with NIDDM and seven healthy nondiabetic subjects matched for sex, age, and obesity. Glucose oxidation was measured simultaneously by indirect calorimetry and the isotopedilution technique. Although glucose oxidation and nonoxidative storage were lower (P less than 0.05) in diabetic than nondiabetic subjects during the low- and high-dose insulin infusions, oxidation of intracellularly derived glucose, estimated by subtracting the rate of oxidation measured isotopically (i.e., glucose oxidation derived from the extracellular space) from that measured by indirect calorimetry (i.e., total glucose oxidation), did not differ in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects during the low-dose insulin infusion (3.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.1 mumol.kg-1.min-1). Both techniques provided identical estimates of glucose oxidation during the high-dose insulin infusion. Impaired oxidation of extracellularly but not intracellularly derived glucose strongly suggests that the cause of decreased glucose oxidation in patients with NIDDM is secondary to impaired glucose transport and/or phosphorylation rather than a primary abnormality in the oxidative pathway.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the role of muscle and liver in the pathogenesis of postprandial hyperglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we administered an oral glucose load enriched with [14C]glucose to 10 NIDDM subjects and 10 age- and weight-matched nondiabetic volunteers and compared muscle glucose disposal by measuring forearm balance of glucose, lactate, alanine, O2, and CO2 (with forearm calorimetry). In addition, we used the dual-lable isotope method to compare overall rates of glucose appearance (Ra) and disappearance (Rd), suppression of endogenous glucose output, and splanchnic glucose sequestration. During the initial 1-1.5 h after glucose ingestion, plasma glucose increased by approximately 8 mM in NIDDM vs. approximately 3 mM in nondiabetic subjects (P less than 0.01); overall glucose Ra was nearly 11 g greater in NIDDM than nondiabetic subjects (45.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 34.4 +/- 1.5 g, P less than 0.01), but glucose Rd was not significantly different in NIDDM (35.1 +/- 2.4 g) and nondiabetic (33.3 +/- 2.7 g) subjects. The greater overall glucose Ra of NIDDM subjects was due to 6.8 g greater endogenous glucose output (13.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 6.8 +/- 1.0 g, P less than 0.01) and 3.8 g less oral glucose splanchnic sequestration of the oral load (31.4 +/- 1.5 vs. 27.5 +/- 0.9 g, P less than 0.05). Although glucose taken up by muscle was not significantly different in NIDDM and nondiabetic subjects (39.3 +/- 3.5 vs. 41.0 +/- 2.5 g/5 h), a greater amount of the glucose taken up by muscle in NIDDM was released as lactate and alanine (11.7 +/- 1.0 vs. 5.2 +/- 0.3 g in nondiabetic subjects, P less than 0.01), and less was stored (11.7 +/- 1.3 vs. 16.9 +/- 1.5 g, P less than 0.05). We conclude that increased systemic glucose delivery, due primarily to reduced suppression of endogenous hepatic glucose output and, to a lesser extent, reduced splanchnic glucose sequestration, is the predominant factor responsible for postprandial hyperglycemia in NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "The extrapancreatic effects of sulfonylurea drugs include increased glucose uptake by certain peripheral tissues. To study this effect, we used BC3H1 myocytes, which are reported to respond to these drugs. Within 30 min, tolbutamide and glyburide increased [3H]-2-deoxyglucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner. The inactive analogue carboxytolbutamide had no effect on glucose transport. Because increases in glucose transport may be mediated by activation of the diacylglycerol-protein kinase C signaling system, we examined the effects of these drugs on lipid metabolism and protein kinase C activity. Unlike insulin, tolbutamide and glyburide failed to increase [3H]glycerol labeling of diacylglycerol or labeling of phospholipids by 32P. After 30 min of treatment with tolbutamide or glyburide, however, membrane-associated and cytosolic protein kinase C activity were each increased. When cells were treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 48 h to deplete certain isoforms of protein kinase C, glyburide, tolbutamide, and acute TPA treatment failed to increase glucose uptake, suggesting that TPA and sulfonylureas operate through activation of a common pathway. The effect of glyburide was additive to TPA in stimulating glucose uptake at low but not high TPA concentrations. As with insulin and TPA, extracellular Ca2+ was not essential for sulfonylurea-stimulated glucose uptake. Staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, blocked glyburide-, tolbutamide-, and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In intact cells, glyburide stimulated the phosphorylation of both 80,000-Mr and 40,000-Mr proteins, which are markers for protein kinase C activation. Addition of sulfonylureas directly to the protein kinase C assay system in vitro provoked dioleinlike effects, in that sensitivity of the enzyme to Ca2+ was increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The highest frequencies and most severe retinopathy were found in insulin-using individuals with undetectable or low plasma C-peptide (less than 0.3 nM), whereas the lowest frequencies of retinopathy were found in older-onset overweight individuals not using insulin. In older-onset individuals using insulin, having no detectable C-peptide was significantly associated with the presence of proliferative retinopathy. Otherwise, within each group (younger onset using insulin, older onset using insulin, and older onset not using insulin), after controlling for other characteristics associated with retinopathy, there was no relationship between higher levels of C-peptide and lower frequency of or less severe retinopathy.\r"

To classify subjects as insulin sensitive or insulin resistant, whole-body and forearm glucose disposal, oxidative and nonoxidative glucose disposal (indirect calorimetry), and glycogen synthesis (muscle glycogen content in needle biopsies) were measured under euglycemic conditions at two insulin concentrations. Whole-body and forearm muscle glucose disposal were significantly reduced in diabetic patients compared with control subjects. The reduction in total glucose disposal was due to similar relative reductions in oxidative and nonoxidative glucose disposal, pointing toward rate limitation early in glucose metabolism. The defect in nonoxidative glucose disposal was at least partly due to a defect in muscle glycogen synthesis, because muscle glycogen content failed to increase in response to an increase in the plasma insulin concentration in the diabetic patients. The most-insulin-resistant type 1 diabetic patients were restudied under conditions where, by glucose mass action, whole-body glucose disposal was forced to be similar to that in the control subjects. Matching glucose fluxes in the two groups resulted in similar rates of forearm and whole-body oxidative and nonoxidative glucose disposal and muscle glycogen synthesis, but it did not result in accumulation of free intracellular glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, or lactate in muscle. These data imply that the rate-limiting defect for glucose disposal in skeletal muscle of type I diabetic patients is at the level of glucose transport.\r"

IC injection of either human interleukin-1 beta, human interleukin-1 alpha, or rat interleukin-1 beta induced a dose-dependent inhibition of gastric acid output. At IC doses less than 100 ng, human interleukin-1 beta was more effective than the other forms or sources of interleukin-1, whereas at higher doses (100-500 ng), human interleukins-1 beta and -1 alpha and rat interleukin-1 beta were equipotent. The inhibitory effect was observed 30 minutes after interleukin-1 injection and maintained throughout the 6-hour experimental period. IC injection of interleukin-1 beta inhibited vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion induced by IC injection of the stable thyrotropin-releasing hormone analogue RX 77368. Indomethacin (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg, IP, -30 minutes) induced a dose-related prevention of the inhibitory effect of IC interleukin-1 beta. IC injection of the corticotropin-releasing factor antagonist alpha-CRF9-41, bilateral adrenalectomy, and noradrenergic blockade with bretylium did not influence the antisecretory effect of interleukin-1. Polypeptide action was not related to changes in circulating gastrin levels. Human interleukin-1 beta injected IV also inhibited gastric acid secretion, but the peripheral dose required to induce a significant effect was 10(3)-fold higher than when given centrally. These results show that IC interleukin-1 beta acts centrally to induce a long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, and this effect requires the integrity of prostaglandin pathways. These data suggest a possible interaction between the immune and gastrointestinal systems.\r"

The patients were placed on total parenteral nutrition and treated concomitantly with corticosteroids, antibiotics (often metronidazole), sulfasalazine, and/or azathioprine. Fifteen of the 16 Crohn's colitis patients were initially managed without surgery. Four patients subsequently relapsed, two responded to reinstituted medical therapy, and two underwent colon resection 2 and 4 years later. Of 22 ulcerative colitis patients, 16 required surgery during the initial hospitalization, one patient subsequently had surgery, and one died after refusing surgery. Three of the other four continue in remission on medical therapy. Thus, there were significant differences in this series between the clinical courses of severe ulcerative colitis and severe Crohn's colitis. While most of the ulcerative colitis patients with severe disease underwent colectomy, most of the patients with severe but uncomplicated Crohn's colitis responded to aggressive medical therapy, of which total parenteral nutrition and perhaps bowel rest seemed to be an important part. Afterwards, the majority remained in remission on long-term medical therapy.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that supplemental dietary calcium decreases hyperproliferation of colonic epithelial cells because calcium precipitates and thus inactivates luminal bile acids. Therefore, 12 healthy men were studied before and after dietary calcium supplementation (35.5 mmol/day) to quantify intestinal associations of calcium, phosphate, and bile acids. The supplemental dietary calcium was almost completely (95%) recovered, mainly in feces. Calcium increased the fecal excretion of both phosphate (31%) and bile acids (53%) and decreased the ratio of dihydroxy to trihydroxy bile acids in duodenal bile almost twofold. In vitro studies showed that precipitation of glycodeoxycholic acid was caused by the formation of insoluble calcium phosphate. Water-soluble and calcium-associated amounts of phosphate and bile acids in feces were measured by resolubilization studies, using the calcium chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetate. In both the control and calcium periods, significant amounts of phosphate (80% and 90%) and bile acids (33% and 50%) were calcium-associated. Moreover, the calcium-induced increments in fecal phosphate and bile acids were completely calcium-associated. Calcium decreased the amount of water-soluble phosphate but not of bile acids. These results indicate that supplemental calcium stimulates formation of insoluble calcium phosphate in the intestinal lumen and thus increases binding of luminal bile acids.\r"

  ".W": "The Caco-2 cells have been used as a model system to study the pathways of diamine oxidase secretion by the intestinal epithelium. When grown in Transwell filter chamber devices, the polarized cell monolayers released the enzyme preferentially into the basal chamber. Heparin (1-10 USP U/mL) rapidly induced a marked stimulation of enzyme secretion only when in contact with the basolateral cell membrane, where high affinity binding sites for [3H]heparin were also exclusively located. Among the other glycosaminoglycans tested, only heparan sulfate (150 mg/mL) was able to induce enzyme release; chondroitin sulfate (150 mg/mL) and dermatan sulfate (150 mg/mL) were without effect. Four monoclonal antibodies specific for human diamine oxidase were produced and found to immunoprecipitate a single protein with a molecular weight of 95,000 (under reducing conditions) from the culture medium of Caco-2 cells. Immunofluorescence staining of cryostat sections of human small intestine with these four antibodies localized diamine oxidase at the lateral and basal sides of the villus cells. Staining was markedly reduced in specimens obtained from patients who received doses of heparin in vivo. This study concludes that release of diamine oxidase by intestinal cells occurs specifically at the basolateral aspect of the cells, most likely through the constitutive secretory pathway. Heparin may induce its marked stimulation of enzyme release by complexing with diamine oxidase bound to the cell surface or through interaction with specific binding sites also located in the basolateral membrane. In the intestinal mucosa in vivo, the basal aspect of the villus cells represents the main site of diamine oxidase storage in the presence of normal circulating levels of heparin.\r"

Hepatocytes were incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta, recombinant interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Synthesis of C-reactive protein was studied at the mRNA and protein levels. Only recombinant interleukin-6 was capable of inducing C-reactive protein-mRNA and C-reactive protein-protein synthesis. Also, fibrinogen and alpha-1-antitrypsin synthesis measured by immunoprecipitation with specific antisera increased in a dose-dependent, time-dependent manner, whereas albumin synthesis decreased to about 50% of controls. Maximal effects were observed at 100 to 300 units of recombinant interleukin-6/ml culture medium after 20 hr of incubation. Although the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone slightly modulated the effect of recombinant interleukin-6, it was not an absolute requirement for the induction of acute-phase protein synthesis in human hepatocytes. In pulse-chase experiments it was shown that the time course of the disappearance of the acute-phase proteins from the cells and their appearance in the medium is not influenced by recombinant interleukin-6. This finding suggests that recombinant interleukin-6 exerts its regulatory effect on acute-phase protein synthesis at the pretranslational level.\r"

Cultured VSMC were obtained from the renal arteries of 14-week-old Wistar rats by the explant method. Micromolar concentrations of dexamethasone, given as pretreatment for 48 hours, suppressed the ANF-mediated response. The dexamethasone-induced suppression was detectable at 6 hours and reached a maximum 24 hours after administration in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibitors of protein synthesis blocked this effect of the glucocorticoid. The basal activity of guanylate cyclase in the dexamethasone-treated cells was lower than in the control cells. Other steroids having glucocorticoid action mimicked this suppression of the ANF-mediated response. This suppression was blocked by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. The results suggest that glucocorticoids suppress ANF-mediated cGMP formation by VSMC through glucocorticoid type II receptors and the induction of protein synthesis. Suppression of the ANF-mediated response may play a role in glucocorticoid-induced hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Ten episodic cluster headache patients in their active cluster period, ten patients in remission and five control subjects were monitored for minute to minute changes in oxygen saturation (SaO2) and pulse rate before and after nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. A transient but significant decrease in SaO2 and increase in pulse rate of 25 minutes duration occurred following NTG in all groups. These changes may reflect physiologic hemodynamic effects of NTG as a smooth muscle relaxant. Subsequently, SaO2 levels and pulse rate recovered to baseline values in remission and control groups. In contrast, SaO2 values in the active cluster group decreased further and after an extended period culminated in cluster headache attacks in 10/10 patients. Three major changes, therefore, distinguished active cluster patients from remission and control groups. First, the magnitude of oxygen desaturation increased after the physiological effects of NTG ceased. Second, oxygen desaturation was sustained for an additional 9 to 30 minutes duration. Third, the hypoxemic state culminated in attacks in all cases. Our findings suggest that the active cluster period may be characterized by an impaired mechanism to autoregulate, and thus compensate, for hypoxemia. It is further proposed that persistence of hypoxemia and the cluster attack onset may share a common mechanism, coupling the two events. We suggest that abnormal central and/or peripheral chemoreceptor activity may be responsible for these events.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we instilled FC-100, a fluorocarbon, and Tween 20, a detergent, which have higher minimum surface tensions and less hysteresis than surfactant, into 15 full-term and 14 preterm lambs. FC-100 and Tween 20 were as efficient as natural surfactant in improving gas exchange and compliance in preterm lambs with respiratory failure. Dynamic compliance correlated with the equilibrium surface tension of the alveolar wash in both full-term (P less than 0.02) and preterm (P less than 0.008) lambs. Functional residual capacity in full-term and preterm lambs was lower after treatment with the two test agents than with surfactant, findings consistent with qualitative histology. Oxygenation in full-term lambs correlated with mean lung volumes (P less than 0.003), suggesting that the hysteresis and/or low minimum surface tension of surfactant may improve mean lung volume, and hence oxygenation, by maintaining functional residual capacity. The effects of the test agents suggest that agents with biophysical properties different from surfactant may still aid lung expansion.\r"

  ".W": "A theoretical analysis of the CO2 control of the respiratory system is presented using both analytic and simulation techniques. A stability index (SI) is obtained by linearizing a dynamic first-order model with a time delay. Analytically, SI values greater than unity predict an unstable response to a disturbance. Because the first-order model is reduced from a higher-order physiological model, SI can be algebraically related to physiological parameters. This relationship shows that SI increases with a decrease in system tissue volume, metabolic rate, or inspired CO2 partial pressure; SI decreases with a decrease in time delay, cardiac output, controller gain, or controller intercept. Analytically, SI distinguishes stable from unstable domains. By simulations of the nonlinear first-order model, three domains are obtained: an unstable domain (sustained oscillations, SI greater than 1.1), an underdamped stable domain (transient oscillations, 0.3 less than SI less than 1.1), and an overdamped stable domain (no oscillations, 0 less than SI less than 0.3). With this classification, disturbances such as change of state (e.g., from awake to asleep) or sigh may produce transient oscillations if the system becomes underdamped even though stable. Potential applications of this work include quantitative distinction of the physiological factors in control disorders associated with short-term periodicities (e.g., Cheyne-Stokes breathing, sleep apnea, breathing at altitude).\r"

We measured ventilatory output via pneumotachograph in the nasal mask, PETCO2, esophageal pressure, inspiratory and expiratory resistance (RL,I and RL,E). Changes in PETCO2 were confirmed with PCO2 measurements in arterialized venous blood in all conditions in one subject. During wakefulness, pulmonary resistance (RL) remained constant throughout inspiration, whereas in stage 2 and especially in stage 3-4 NREM sleep, RL rose markedly throughout inspiration. Expired minute ventilation (VE) decreased by 12% in HRS, and PETCO2 increased in LRS (3.3 Torr) and HRS (4.9 Torr). CPAP decreased RL,I to AW levels and increased end-expiratory lung volume 0.25-0.93 liter. Tidal volume (VT) and mean inspiratory flow rate (VT/TI) increased significantly with CPAP. Inspiratory time (TI) shortened, and PETCO2 decreased 3.6 Torr but remained 1.3 Torr above AW. During CPAP (RL,I equal to AW), with PETCO2 returned to the level of LRS, VT/TI and VE were 83 and 52% higher than during LRS alone. Also on CPAP, with PETCO2 made equal to HRS, VT, VT/TI, and VE were 67, 112, and 67% higher than during HRS alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because activated neutrophils extrude cytotoxic proteases, the current study was conducted to evaluate the role of proteases in the pulmonary microvascular injury. Twelve sheep, instrumented for collection of lung lymph, were insufflated with cotton smoke. The sheep were treated 30 min after smoke inhalation with either gabexate mesilate (an inhibitor of serine proteases) or vehicle. Smoke inhalation resulted in an increased protease activity in the lung interstitium, as evidenced by decreases in both antiprotease activity and immunoreactive alpha 2-macroglobulin. Intravenous infusion of gabexate mesilate prevented the decrease in antiprotease activity. The protease inhibitor significantly attenuated the smoke-induced increase in transvascular fluid and protein flux, with untreated animals exhibiting 460% increases in flux compared with 180% in the inhibitor treated sheep. The protease inhibitor also eliminated the functional degradation in gas exchange that was observed in the untreated sheep. These studies strongly suggest that an increase in pulmonary proteolytic enzyme activity is responsible for a significant fraction of the degradation in microvascular integrity and gas exchange that is associated with smoke inhalation injury.\r"

In pentobarbital-anesthetized, vagotomized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated cats, chemoreceptor activation enhanced the inspiratory depolarization of membrane potential in 32 of 36 IHMs. This was manifested as an increase in either the amplitude (n = 13) or duration (n = 3) or an increase in both amplitude and duration (n = 16) of the inspiratory membrane potential depolarization. The amplitude and duration of the inspiratory membrane potential depolarization increased 98 +/- 15% (n = 29) and 78 +/- 13% (n = 19), respectively. Similar patterns of enhanced activity (increased duration and/or amplitude of membrane depolarization) were observed in five expiratory hypoglossal motoneurons (EHMs) after chemoreceptor activation. In 16 of the 32 IHMs, chemoreceptor activation also evoked changes in IHM membrane potential during expiration: enhanced post-inspiratory discharge (n = 6), expiratory depolarization/discharge (n = 6), and tonic depolarization/discharge, which persisted for several respiratory cycles (n = 4). The arterial chemoreceptors provide a powerful excitatory input to IHMs during both inspiration and expiration. This excitatory drive to IHMs and EHMs will aid in the maintenance of upper airway patency throughout the respiratory cycle during increases in end-tidal CO2.\r"

In seven animals with acute HA, plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration increased progressively from 189 +/- 34 to 483 +/- 80 pg/ml (P less than 0.04) as arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) increased in steps from 40 to 80 Torr (pH 7.17 +/- 0.01). Plasma epinephrine (EPI) concentration increased from 30 +/- 15 to 125 +/- 66 pg/ml (P = NS) over the same change in PaCO2. At PaCO2 of 110 Torr, plasma NE increased 3.4-fold above maximal basal concentrations; plasma EPI was 1.8-fold greater than basal under the same conditions. With HA, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased from 1,748 +/- 110 to 1,392 +/- 145 dyn.s.cm-5 (P less than 0.0002), cardiac output (CO) increased from 3.4 +/- 0.3 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 l/min (P less than 0.01), and heart rate (HR) increased from 117 +/- 11 to 154 +/- 17 beats/min (P less than 0.03). To demonstrate that catecholamine secretion was related directly to acidosis caused by an increase in PaCO2, HCO3- was infused in eight other swine to buffer extracellular acute HA (pH 7.37 +/- 0.01 at PaCO2 of 80 Torr). Buffering attenuated the increase in plasma NE, which remained within the normal range at PaCO2 of 80 Torr. The decrease in SVR and increases in CO and HR also were also attenuated by HCO3- buffering of HA.

Synthetic human alpha-ANP was injected into the pulmonary arteries of awake sheep chronically instrumented for measurement of lung mechanics and hemodynamics (n = 7). Base-line dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) and pulmonary resistance (RL) did not change after ANP injection. On separate days, the dose required to reduce Cdyn to 65% of base line (ED65Cdyn) to progressive doses of aerosol histamine and the dose required to increase RL by 100% of the base-line values (ED200RL) to progressive doses of aerosol carbachol were determined. ANP was given as bolus injections of 1, 5, and 10 micrograms/kg 3 min after either the ED65Cdyn or ED200RL doses of histamine and carbachol, respectively, and the airway response was monitored for 10 min. ANP significantly reversed the rise in RL after carbachol administration (n = 10). This action of ANP was not altered by cyclooxygenase inhibition with ibuprofen. ANP did not reverse the reduction in Cdyn caused by either histamine (n = 7) or carbachol. The bronchodilating effect of ANP appears to be more prominent in the larger central airways than in the peripheral airways. The hemodynamic effects of ANP were similar to those reported by others. Heart rate and cardiac output had a biphasic response, with an initial rise followed by a drop below the base line. Systemic arterial and left atrial pressures decreased significantly. Pulmonary arterial pressure did not change significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients had elevated serum TSH and alpha-subunit concentrations despite high serum thyroid hormone levels. In addition, one patient (no. 1) had elevated serum GH levels with clinical evidence of acromegaly. GH-releasing hormone infusion increased serum levels of TSH, alpha-subunit and GH in the two patients. TRH injection increased serum TSH levels in both patients and, concomitantly, serum alpha-subunit and GH levels in patient 1. Basal TSH levels and their responses to TRH changed reciprocally to changes in serum thyroid hormone levels, although TRH-induced GH release did not. The administration of GnRH also increased serum TSH, alpha-subunit, and GH levels in patient 1. In accordance with these in vivo results, pituitary adenoma cells in culture obtained from patient 1 responded to GH-releasing hormone, TRH, or GnRH to secrete TSH, alpha-subunit, and GH. Incubation of cells with dexamethasone resulted in inhibition of TSH and stimulation of GH secretion without a significant change in alpha-subunit secretion. On the basis of light microscopic and electron microscopic double gold immunohistochemistry, the tumor from patient 1 was a bimorphous adenoma composed of two separate cell types: cells with TSH beta-subunit (TSH beta) and alpha-subunit, and those with GH and alpha-subunit. The remainder consisted mainly of cells with TSH beta and alpha-subunit. The coproduction of the unusual combination of two hormones such as GH and alpha-subunit in a single-type of adenoma cell and the coexistence of thyrotrophs and somatotrophs in one pituitary adenoma along with the aberrant responses of TSH beta, alpha-subunit, and GH to multiple hypothalamic hormones suggest the dedifferentiation of pituitary cells to multipotential progenitor cells by neoplastic transformation.\r"

The circulating levels of the whole N-terminus [amino acids 1-98; pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) from the midportion of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone were increased 2-fold in patients with both extraadrenal and intraadrenal pheochromocytomas. In both the intraadrenal and extraadrenal patients N-terminus [pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) circulating levels increased further during surgical manipulation and returned to normal after surgical removal of their respective tumors. Each of these pheochromocytomas was found to have pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67)-binding sites that were functional, since they could enhance the guanylate cyclase-cGMP system 2-fold in these pheochromocytomas. The entire 126 amino acids of the prohormone were present within each of the pheochromocytomas, since both the whole N-terminus and C-terminus (i.e. ANF) of the prohormone were present. Examination of the pheochromocytomas by electron microscopy revealed electron-dense granules similar to those in the heart, which have been associated with the synthesis and storage of the ANF prohormone. We conclude that 1) the whole N-terminus [pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) of the ANF prohormone circulate at higher concentrations in persons with pheochromocytomas and return to normal with removal of the tumors; 2) pheochromocytomas contain specific binding sites for pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67); 3) these binding sites are functional, since pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67) could enhance the enzyme guanylate cyclase within these tumors; and 4) the entire 126 amino acids of the ANF prohormone are present within these tumors, which have electron-dense granules associated with polypeptide hormone synthesis, suggesting that the ANF prohormone is being synthesized within the pheochromocytomas.\r"

Discrepancy in serum hTSH level was observed by different assay methods. Coexistence of both autoantibodies for hTSH and for anti-hTSH antibody were demonstrated by the reaction of the patient's antibody with both 125I-hTSH and 125I-anti-hTSH (monoclonal antibody; mAb). These two autoantibodies belong to the polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG). The autoantibody for hTSH recognized only beta-subunit of hTSH. Neither stimulating type of TRAb in Graves' disease nor blocking type of TRAb in primary hypothyroidism interfered with the binding of the patient's antibody to 125I-hTSH or 125I-anti-hTSH. Anti-idiotypic antibody (anti-ID antibody) for anti-hTSH antibody was purified by anti-hTSH antibody affinity chromatography. The binding reaction of 125I-anti-hTSH (mAb) with this anti-ID antibody could be inhibited by the unlabeled hTSH. This anti-ID antibody might represent the internal image of the nonbiological active site of TSH molecule, because of absence of thyroid stimulating activity. Goiter in this patient may have occurred by the unbound TSH with IgG (free TSH) and the bound TSH with IgG, because TSH levels in both the whole serum and the IgG free serum (the unbound TSH with IgG) were decreased significantly by T4 treatment. Coexistence of these antibodies may participate in the autoimmune mechanism of an idiotype-anti-idiotype network.\r"

  ".U": "91035820\r", 
  ".W": "Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by an unusual phenotypic appearance and reduced biological activity of the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G-protein of adenylyl cyclase (Gs alpha). In most AHO patients deficient Gs alpha activity is associated with generalized target organ resistance to hormones that act via stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. This form of the disorder is termed pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (PHP Ia). By contrast, other patients with Gs alpha deficiency fail to demonstrate clinical evidence of hormone resistance and are considered to have the related disorder pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (pseudoPHP). Previous studies demonstrating deficient Gs alpha bioactivity in cell membranes from patients with AHO used functional assays that were unable to distinguish between reduced amounts of normal Gs alpha protein and normal amounts of defective Gs alpha protein. In the present study we used specific Gs alpha antisera to analyze immunoactive Gs alpha protein in erythrocyte and fibroblast membranes from 20 patients with AHO who had either normal or reduced levels of Gs alpha mRNA. Cell membranes were subjected to immunoblot analysis using Gs alpha antisera developed against synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid sequences in the amino- or carboxyl-terminus of the Gs alpha molecule. Fibroblast membranes from patients with AHO who had reduced or normal levels of Gs alpha mRNA contained both the 45- and 52-kDa forms of the Gs alpha protein in quantities that were significantly less [mean +/- SE, 52 +/- 6%; (n = 8) for reduced mRNA and 35 +/- 19% (n = 2) for normal mRNA, percentage of control values] than those present in membranes from normal subjects. Similar reductions were found in the level of the 45-kDa form of Gs alpha in erythrocyte membranes from all AHO patients studied [40 +/- 4% (mean +/- SE) of control values]. No abnormal forms of Gs alpha protein were detected. Cell membranes from patients with PHP type Ia and from patients with pseudoPHP contained levels of immunoactive Gs alpha that were equivalently reduced (43 +/- 4% vs. 42 +/- 5%, respectively). By contrast, erythrocyte membranes from patients with PHP type Ib, who have normal Gs alpha activity, had normal levels of Gs alpha immunoactivity (101 +/- 7%). These results indicate that most patients with AHO have reduced levels of Gs alpha protein as the basis for deficient Gs alpha bioactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment with human leucocyte interferon (IFN alpha) has been associated with the development of thyroid autoimmunity and hypothyroidism, but it is not certain whether this phenomenon was a result of contamination with IFN gamma, which induced HLA class II antigen expression on T-lymphocytes. We prospectively studied 11 subjects (5 females and 6 males; mean age, 26.8 yr; range, 18-36) with chronic active hepatitis B who were randomized to receive recombinant human IFN gamma (rhIFN gamma; 10(6) U/m2.day, im, 3 times/week) for 16 weeks. Goiter was not present, and no patient had a history or family history of autoimmune diseases. Serial thyroid functions, including serum T4, T3, free thyroid hormone index, free T4 and TSH before, during, and on subsequent follow-up for a period of 1 yr were all normal. Eight patients had adequate serial samples for study of serological and lymphocyte subpopulations. None of the patients treated with rhIFN gamma developed thyroglobulin or thyroid microsomal antibodies. However, four patients developed antinuclear and smooth muscle autoantibodies during or after rhIFN gamma treatment. Treatment with rhIFN gamma resulted in a significant increase in circulating T-lymphocytes and HLA-DR-positive T-cells (P less than 0.05), with equal proportions of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells becoming DR positive. The percentage of HLA-DR-positive T-cells remained elevated after discontinuation of rhIFN gamma. Also, rhIFN gamma treatment led to a decrease in the number of circulating granulocytes and interleukin-2 receptor-positive cells. In conclusion, we did not observe any thyroid dysfunction or thyroid autoimmunity in our patients treated with the studied dose of rhIFN gamma, but induction of other autoantibodies was observed.\r"

  ".W": "Having recently demonstrated highly vectorial and FSH-stimulated inhibin secretion by immature rat Sertoli cells in vitro, we wished to determine if vectorial secretion of inhibin was also characteristic of primate Sertoli cells. By adapting techniques for isolation of Sertoli cells from testes of the immature rat and cynomolgus monkey. Sertoli cells were isolated from immature baboon testes. Sertoli cells were then plated onto matrix-impregnated porous filters and cultured in twin chamber assemblies in fully defined, supplemented HEPES-buffered Eagles medium. Inhibin was measured in conditioned culture media by an heterologous RIA validated for primate inhibins. Throughout 28 days of culture immunoreactive inhibin was readily detectable in the upper chambers whereas inhibin was undetectable or just detectable in the lower chambers. The median ratio of upper to lower chamber inhibin content was 15.3 under basal conditions rising to 41 under FSH stimulation. Inhibin secretion into the upper chamber was increased 2.5 +/- 0.4 times by stimulation with ovine FSH (100 ng/ml). We conclude that immature Sertoli cells from a nonhuman primate demonstrate FSH-responsive and highly vectorial secretion of inhibin almost exclusively into the upper chamber. These data suggest that during maturation mammalian Sertoli cells secrete inhibin vectorially mainly from the apical surface of the cell towards the seminiferous tubular lumen. The predominance of inhibin secretion into the seminiferous tubule during testicular maturation suggests that inhibin may have an important paracrine or autocrine role in the developmental biology of spermiogenesis.\r"

Mean 24-h LH and FSH levels rose significantly with increasing pubertal stage in both girls and boys. LH peak amplitude increased significantly with increasing pubertal stage for both sexes, whereas FSH peak amplitude did not. LH and FSH peaks were present throughout the 24-h period in all children, but the frequency did not change significantly with increasing pubertal stage. Mean gonadotropin levels, peak amplitudes, and peak frequencies tended to be higher at night from pubertal stages 1-4 of puberty. There were no significant sex differences in mean LH, LH peak amplitude, or LH peak frequency. The LHRH-stimulated peak LH to peak FSH ratio was greater in boys than girls during pubertal stages 1-3 and was less useful in distinguishing pubertal from prepubertal boys. For girls, the most accurate index of pubertal gonadotropin secretion was a LHRH-stimulated peak LH to peak FSH ratio greater than 0.66, which detected 96% of the pubertal girls with no false positives. For boys, the most accurate index was a maximum spontaneous nighttime LH level of 12 IU/L or more, which detected 90% of the pubertal boys with no false positives. We conclude that there are important sex differences in the gonadotropin responses to LHRH during puberty, and that criteria for the onset of pubertal gonadotropin secretion should be sex specific.\r"

This study was designed to determine the effect of inhibin on hCG secretion both early and late in gestation. Villus tissue from 3 term and 3 first trimester (8-10 week) placentas was maintained in an in vitro explant culture model for 5 days. Tissue from each placenta was incubated with control medium in 24 replicate wells for the first 72 h. During the final 48 h, 12 wells received control medium, and 12 wells received medium containing 1% rabbit antiserum raised against the alpha-subunit (residues 1-32) of the human inhibin peptide. The antiserum demonstrated biological activity by increasing serum FSH concentrations in an immature female rat bioassay. The relative increase in hCG secretion at the conclusion of days 4 and 5 in control and antiserum-treated groups for each first trimester and term placenta were compared to pretreatment hCG concentrations on day 3. The relative increases in hCG secretion of first trimester control groups on day 4 (mean +/- SD, 34 +/- 11%) and day 5 (63 +/- 23%) were compared to those in antiserum-treated groups on day 4 (39 +/- 13%) and day 5 (54 +/- 5%) and showed no significant difference between groups on either day. The same comparison in term cultures showed the relative increases in hCG secretion of control groups on day 4 (31 +/- 10%) and day 5 (64 +/- 50%) to be significantly lower than those in antiserum-treated groups on day 4 (100 +/- 41%) and day 5 (150 +/- 108%; P less than 0.001). These findings suggest that inhibin suppresses hCG secretion in term, but not first trimester, placentas.\r"

GnRH release was assessed indirectly by monitoring the LH response by the pituitary, the sensitivity of which had been heightened by prior exposure to pulsatile GnRH. Four of these animals received an i.v. bolus of 0, 1.5, 4.8, 15, 48 and 150 mg/kg BW of each of the amino acids. Plasma gonadotropin and amino acid concentrations were measured immediately before and for 3 hours after administration of Asp and Glu. The 150 mg/kg dose of both amino acids resulted in a dramatic rise in plasma LH concentrations that peaked at 10 min after injection. At this dose plasma Asp and Glu levels increased 200-fold and 50-fold, respectively. No significant LH release was seen with any of the lower doses. These results indicate that i.v. administration of these acidic amino acids in prepubertal monkeys stimulates GnRH release. Based upon this observation, we hypothesize that Asp or Glu could be used to develop a clinical test of GnRH neuronal function.\r"

This study reports on the differences between acromegalic patients bearing tumors without (group 1; n = 51) or with (group 2; n = 29) this alteration. No difference in age, sex, clinical features, duration of the disease, or cure rate was observed between the two groups. By contrast, group 2 patients had higher basal GH levels than group 1. Moreover, a significant difference in sellar morphology was found; group 2 patients more frequently showed sellas of normal size (grade I) than group 1. Hypersecretory activity of group 2 tumors was also apparent at electron microscopy; contrary to those of group 1, cells of group 2 tumors were densely granulated and showed prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. With respect to group 1, group 2 patients were less responsive to GH-releasing hormone, while they were more sensitive to somatostatin- and dopamine-induced GH inhibition. These results suggest that patients with constitutively active adenylyl cyclase have hyperactive tumors; the sensitivity of these tumors to inhibitory agents (somatostatin and dopamine), possibly counteracting the expression of activating mutations, might explain the low rate of tumor growth.\r"

Integrated plasma samples were collected every 10 min for 40 min before iv administration of cocaine (0.4 or 0.8 mg/kg) or an equal volume of vehicle control solution. Synthetic LHRH (100 micrograms, iv) was administered 10 min after cocaine or placebo-cocaine administration, and 10 plasma samples were collected for an additional 100 min. LHRH stimulated a significant increase in LH within 10 min after placebo-cocaine administration (P less than 0.05) and after each dose of cocaine (P less than 0.0001). Cocaine (0.4 mg/kg) significantly enhanced LHRH stimulation of LH compared to placebo or 0.8 mg/kg cocaine administration (P less than 0.01). FSH increased significantly within 20-30 min after LHRH alone (P less than 0.008) and after 0.4 mg/kg cocaine (P less than 0.0001). LHRH-stimulated FSH levels also were significantly higher after 0.4 mg/kg cocaine than after placebo or 0.8 mg/kg cocaine (P less than 0.01). These data indicate that cocaine does not suppress LHRH stimulation of pituitary gonadotropins, and low doses of cocaine significantly enhance LH and FSH release. Consequently, cocaine does not compromise anterior-pituitary function at the level of the gonadotroph and may stimulate hypothalamic release of endogenous LHRH. PRL levels were unchanged by LHRH and placebo-cocaine administration. After LHRH and cocaine administration, PRL levels decreased significantly (P less than 0.05-0.01) and remained suppressed throughout the 110-min postcocaine sampling period. These data indicate that cocaine's significant suppression of PRL is not blocked by LHRH. These findings are consistent with dopaminergic inhibitory control of PRL and suggest that cocaine's inhibition of dopamine reuptake down-regulates pituitary lactotroph activity in rhesus monkey.\r"

To examine which ovarian parameters are altered with aging, 486 cycles from 225 ovulatory infertile women undergoing human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) superovulation and washed intrauterine insemination were analyzed. Infertility factors included endometriosis (68%), unexplained infertility (8.4%), male factor (12.9%), and ovulatory dysfunction (10.7%). Parameters that demonstrated a linear relationship with increasing age included numbers of ampules of hMG required per cycle (r = 0.79; P less than 0.05), days of stimulation (r = 0.73; P less than 0.01), estradiol level at the time of hCG (r = -0.92; P less than 0.0001), number of follicles larger than 15 mm (r = -0.61; P less than 0.05), and rate of rise of estradiol (r = -0.92; P less than 0.0001). These same age-dependent changes were observed in women receiving a standard stimulation protocol (3 ampules hMG beginning on cycle day 2). When standard cycles were limited to the first cycle only, the preovulatory estradiol (r = -0.92; P less than 0.005), slope of estradiol rise (r = -0.92; P less than 0.005), and number of preovulatory follicles (r = -0.92; P less than 0.005) still showed a significant decrease with age. Although the mean estradiol level per preovulatory follicle showed a slight decrease with maternal age, no statistically significant trend was noted. In addition, the cycle day of hCG administration was unaffected by age. With advancing age, there appears to be a decreased ovarian response to an increased amount of stimulation, as measured by steroidogenesis and follicular recruitment; yet the estradiol/follicle remains unaltered, indicating continued health of the follicle. These observations may explain in part the observed decrease in fecundity in older women.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were undertaken to determine whether fasting hyperglycemia can compensate for decreased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, oxidation, and storage in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) as well as to determine whether hyperglycemia normalizes insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glycogen synthase and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activities. To accomplish this, we used the glucose clamp technique with isotopic determination of glucose disposal and indirect calorimetry for measuring the pathways of glucose metabolism, and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies to determine the effects of insulin on glycogen synthase and PDH activities. Nine patients with NIDDM and eight matched non-diabetic subjects were infused with insulin (40 mU/m2.min) while plasma glucose was maintained at the prevailing fasting concentration. During insulin infusion, rates of glucose disposal, storage, and oxidation were the same in the two groups. Insulin infusion significantly activated glycogen synthase fractional velocity to the same extent in NIDDM (0.210 +/- 0.056 vs. 0.332 +/- 0.079) and controls (0.192 +/- 0.036 vs. 0.294 +/- 0.050). Insulin infusion increased PDH fractional velocity in controls (from 0.281 +/- 0.022 to 0.404 +/- 0.038), but not in NIDDM (from 0.356 +/- 0.043 to 0.436 +/- 0.060), although the activity of PDH during insulin infusion did not differ between the groups. We conclude that prevailing fasting hyperglycemia normalizes the nonoxidative and oxidative pathways of insulin-stimulated glucose in metabolism in NIDDM and may act as a homeostatic mechanism to normalize muscle glucose metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "91035882\r", 
  ".W": "In isolated human trophoblastic cells, dopamine (DA) significantly inhibited the angiotensin-II (AII)-stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation by 44 +/- 8% (EC50, 0.5 +/- 0.2 microM) and human placental lactogen (hPL) release by 85 +/- 5% (EC50, 1.0 +/- 0.8 microM). These effects were blocked by sulpiride, a specific D2 antagonist. On the contrary, scherring 23390 (a specific D1 antagonist) and propranolol (a specific beta-adrenergic antagonist) were ineffective, suggesting that these DA effects are mediated through a DA receptor of the D2 subtype. The mechanism by which DA inhibited AII-stimulated inositol phosphate production implicates a GTP-binding protein sensitive to the islet-activating-protein (IAP), since DA's effects on IP accumulation and hPL release were blocked by this toxin. To further characterize this GTP-binding protein, particulate fractions of placental cells were incubated with [alpha-32P]NAD and IAP. Solubilized extracts were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two proteins of 40 and 41 kDa mol wt were specifically ADP ribosylated. They were probably involved in the DA inhibitory processes, since IAP treatment, known to suppress the effects of DA, also reduced the labeling of these two molecules by around 40%. The effects of AII and DA on hPL release appear to be insensitive to the external calcium concentration, since the results were not significantly different in normal (1.8 mM Ca2+) and low Ca2+ (10(-5) M Ca2+) concentrations. On the other hand, increasing the intracellular concentration of cAMP by adding forskolin did not modify the effect of DA on either IP accumulation or hPL release, suggesting that cAMP is not implicated in hPL release from freshly isolated human trophoblastic cells.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the nature of anterior pituitary secretory events in vivo, we have applied a novel waveform-independent deconvolution technique that dissects the underlying secretory behavior of endocrine glands quantitatively from available serial plasma hormone concentration measurements assuming one- or two-compartment elimination kinetics. We used this new tool to ask the following physiological questions. 1) Does the pituitary gland secrete exclusively in randomly dispersed bursts, and/or does a tonic (constitutive) mode of interburst hormone secretion exist? 2) What secretory mechanisms generate the nyctohemeral rhythms in plasma hormone concentrations? Analysis of 24-h plasma concentration profiles of GH, LH, FSH, PRL, TSH, ACTH, and beta-endorphin (n = 6-8 men/group) revealed that 1) pituitary secretion in vivo occurs in an exclusively burst-like mode for all hormones except TSH and PRL (for the latter two, a mixed burst and constitutive mode pertained); 2) significant nyctohemeral regulation of secretory burst frequency alone was not demonstrated for any hormone; 3) prominent 24-h variations in secretory burst amplitude alone were delineated for ACTH and LH; 4) TSH, GH, and beta-endorphin were both frequency and amplitude controlled; 5) no significant diurnal variations in FSH secretory parameters occurred; and 6) a fixed hormone half-life yielded fits of the 24-h data series with a normalized residual variance of less than 8%. We conclude that the normal human anterior pituitary gland releases its multiple (glyco)protein hormones via punctuated secretory episodes unassociated with tonic basal (constitutive) hormone secretion, except in the case of TSH and PRL. Hormone-specific amplitude and/or frequency control of secretory burst activity over 24 h provides the mechanistic basis for the classically recognized 24-h rhythms in plasma concentrations of adenohypophyseal hormones in men.\r"

After treatment with a GnRH agonist and gonadotropin, serum estradiol and follistatin levels were increased, and there was a direct positive correlation between the elevated levels of estradiol and follistatin (r = 0.93, p less than 0.01). Thus, the level of circulating follistatin may likely reflect follicular maturation and be applicable in IVF procedures to determine the optimal timing for oocyte retrieval.\r"

Histopathologic studies revealed dermal infiltration with mature activated T cells (CD4+, CD25+, DR+) with nuclear convolutions and epidermatotropisim. High titers of specific human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I antibodies were detected in the serum. Molecular analysis of DNA extracted from the skin tumor biopsy specimen showed a clonal integration of an HTLV-I provirus and a T-cell clonal population as demonstrated by T-cell receptor beta and gamma gene rearrangement studies. Neither HTLV-I provirus nor T-cell receptor rearrangements were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells DNA despite the presence of rare adult T cell leukemia cells (less than 1%) and a small excess of DR-expressing cells, and detection of HTLV-I Pol and Px sequences by in vitro gene amplification. In this case only gene analysis of the skin lesions made possible an early diagnosis of a cutaneous adult T cell leukemia. This illustrates the need for such molecular studies to differentiate, in HTLV-I seropositive patients from endemic areas, a HTLV-I-induced T cell lymphoma from HTLV-I-nonrelated cutaneous T cell lymphomas.\r"

To further characterize the direct coronary hemodynamic actions of atrial natriuretic peptide in humans and to assess the safety of its administration in patients with coronary artery disease, incremental doses of synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide and nitroglycerin were infused into the left coronary artery in 14 patients, 11 of whom had coronary artery disease. Both agents caused dose-related increases in total coronary sinus blood flow. The largest dose of atrial natriuretic peptide given to all patients (100 micrograms) increased mean coronary sinus blood flow from 127 +/- 7 to 149 +/- 9 ml/min (p less than 0.05) and decreased coronary vascular resistance from 0.93 +/- 0.07 to 0.81 +/- 0.05 mm Hg/ml per min (p less than 0.05); mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were not affected by this dose of atrial natriuretic peptide. The greatest changes in coronary sinus blood flow (+25%) and coronary vascular resistance (-18%) after atrial natriuretic peptide administration occurred in the patients with coronary artery disease and no other associated cardiovascular disease. The maximal effects of atrial natriuretic peptide were similar to those of nitroglycerin, and no untoward effects were observed. Thus, atrial natriuretic peptide is a direct coronary vasodilator in humans. Its maximal dose effects are similar to those of nitroglycerin and were well tolerated in this small group of patients. The physiologic importance and therapeutic potential of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with coronary artery disease merit further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "The evaluation of survivors of sudden cardiac death with serial electrophysiologic studies involves a lengthy and expensive hospitalization, especially when an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is ultimately necessary. The cost efficacy of this conventional approach was therefore compared with direct implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator after the first electrophysiologic study. Thirty-two survivors of sudden death who had inducible ventricular tachycardia during their initial electrophysiologic study underwent serial drug trials. At discharge 12 (37%) were taking an antiarrhythmic drug found to prevent induction of ventricular tachycardia and 20 underwent cardioverter-defibrillator implantation after serial drug trials proved ineffective. The average length of hospitalization for this group that had undergone serial drug testing was 20.2 +/- 9.3 days at an average cost of $48,900 +/- $31,600. Seven survivors of sudden death had no inducible ventricular tachycardia during their initial electrophysiologic study and underwent direct cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Their average length of hospitalization was 12.6 +/- 6.2 days at an average cost of $40,400 +/- $8,300. It is concluded that automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation as an early intervention is not more costly and indeed may be cost-effective compared with therapy guided by serial electrophysiologic testing. As antitachycardia devices become more versatile, long lived and easier to implant, earlier implantation is likely to compare even more favorably with drug therapy.\r"

Left anterior descending artery diameter increased 55% in normal subjects, 27% in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 10% in those with end-stage renal disease with left ventricular hypertrophy. These results demonstrate that high frequency ultrasound can detect nitroglycerin-induced changes in left anterior descending artery diameter. The percent increase is related to the diameter before nitroglycerin administration, which is related to the underlying diagnosis and left ventricular mass index.\r"

  ".W": "The production of an anterior myocardial infarction as part of an experimental animal model for sudden death was burdened by a persistently elevated mortality rate (30%) despite the use of traditional antiarrhythmic drugs. Mortality was reduced when tocainide (600 mg three times daily) was empirically administered for 4 days before and 4 days after myocardial infarction. Retrospective analysis showed that mortality at 4 days after infarction was significantly lower in the tocainide-treated dogs than in the preceding large group of dogs that had not been so treated (5 [9%] of 55, versus 64 [32%] of 199, p less than 0.01). This difference was still evident 30 days after myocardial infarction (13 [24%] of 55 versus 83 [42%] of 199; p less than 0.05). This observation led to the present prospective study in 106 dogs with a similar protocol but with a randomized sequence. At 4 days after myocardial infarction, the mortality rate was 55% lower in the tocainide group than in the control group (7 [12.5%] of 56 versus 14 [28%] of 50; p less than 0.05). During the 10 days after treatment withdrawal 9 (18%) of 49 dogs in the tocainide group died compared with only 2 (5%) of 36 in the control group. This rebound in mortality produced similar survival figures in the two groups at 14 and at 30 days after infarction when mortality was 30% (17 of 56) in the tocainide group and 34% (17 of 50) in the control group. The tocainide plasma levels were 7.4 +/- 4 micrograms/ml the day before infarction and 7.2 +/- 3 micrograms/ml 3 days after infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate whether two different antihistamines could inhibit local eosinophil infiltration and allergen-induced nonspecific nasal hyperreactivity, 15 subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study outside the pollen season. At steady-state levels of either 60 mg of terfenadine, twice daily, cetirizine, 10 mg once daily, or placebo, a nasal methacholine challenge was performed before and 24 hours after a nasal allergen challenge. The volume of the methacholine-induced nasal secretions was measured. The response to allergen was determined with a scoring technique. Cells from the nasal mucosal surface were harvested with the aid of a rhinobrush. Both antihistamines induced a similar (p less than 0.01) reduction in nasal symptoms after the allergen challenge compared with placebo. Both antihistamines inhibited the increased nonspecific nasal reactivity induced by methacholine 24 hours later (p less than 0.05). The allergen challenge induced an increase in surface eosinophils, which, however, appeared unaffected by any of the active treatments. Since histamine per se does not induce changes in nonspecific reactivity, we suggest that the antihistamines possess other properties besides being H1-receptor antagonists.\r"

Two hundred thirty-three patients (aged 12 to 65 years) from eight centers were randomized to treatment, one spray per nostril, four times daily, with nedocromil sodium, cromolyn sodium, or matched placebo (80, 76, and 77 patients, respectively). All patients had at least a 2-year history of ragweed seasonal allergic rhinitis. Treatment was for 8 weeks during the ragweed season, and daily pollen counts were used to identify the peak 3-week period. Clinic examinations were made before and after the 1-week baseline and after 1, 3, 5, and 8 weeks of treatment. Rhinitis symptoms were recorded each day by the patients. Nedocromil sodium was more effective than placebo (p less than 0.05) in relieving symptoms as recorded by the patients. Cromolyn sodium was also more effective than placebo, but the difference was not usually significant. Similarly, the active treatments were both better than placebo for clinical parameters measured at visits and for global opinions of treatment, and more rescue therapy was used by the placebo-treated group. There was no significant difference between the two active treatments, but the trend throughout was in favor of nedocromil sodium. Our findings demonstrated nedocromil sodium to be at least as effective as an established therapy (cromolyn sodium) in reducing symptoms of rhinitis during the peak ragweed pollen season.\r"

  ".W": "Unlike the classic antihistamines, the new H1-receptor antagonists do not block cholinergic or central H1 receptors and thus do not produce the side effects, such as sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, and excessive mucosal drying, that are commonly associated with the older agents. Important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences that exist among this class of antihistamines translate into varying pharmacologic effectiveness. Terfenadine, loratadine, and cetirizine are all rapidly absorbed in healthy and allergic volunteers (peak plasma levels, 2 to 5 hours); astemizole, however, has an initial distribution phase of 2 to 3 days. Further, astemizole has the longest time to relief of symptoms in this class; histamine wheal inhibition is not apparent until the second day of 10 mg dosing and does not peak for 9 to 12 days. In comparison, terfenadine's antihistaminic action peaks at 3 to 4 hours, loratadine's at 4 to 6 hours, and cetirizine's at 4 to 10 hours. However, whereas the recommended dose of loratadine (10 mg) confers 50% wheal inhibition, 60 mg terfenadine produces an 85% to 90% inhibition. In addition, loratadine and cetrizine have apparent dose-related sedative effects.\r"

  ".W": "Because the older antihistamines possessed relatively weak antihistaminic action, as well as sedative and anticholinergic effects, they could not be administered in doses high enough to confer relief to atopic patients with asthma. In contrast, the newer nonsedating, more potent H1-receptor antagonists appear to achieve effective histamine blockade in patients with asthma. Terfenadine and astemizole inhibit bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled allergens by 50% in the early asthmatic reaction. High-potency antihistamines also significantly reduce cough and wheeze as compared with placebo in grass pollen-sensitive asthma patients. Significant reductions in symptom severity and bronchodilator use were found with terfenadine, 120 mg twice daily, although these improvements may be confined to younger patients. Some of the newer antihistamines have demonstrated interesting effects on the late-phase allergic response. Azelastine partially inhibits bronchoconstriction in the allergen-induced late reaction of atopic persons with asthma, possibly by suppressing the release of additional inflammatory mediators. In the skin, cetirizine has been found to reduce eosinophil and neutrophil late-phase infiltration and prostaglandin D2 release. These interesting properties now warrant further investigation in clinical studies.\r"

Then, patients with CU (15) and NC subjects (10) were randomly assigned to take either hydroxyzine (100 mg/day), terfenadine (120 mg/day), or placebo for 28 days. The effects of such treatment on the clinical response and on the profile of compound 48/80-induced HR during a 4-hour period were analyzed. Treatment with hydroxyzine in patients with CU improved the clinical symptoms and modified the profile of HR; more histamine was recovered at 1 hour (p less than 0.05) and 2 hours (p less than 0.05), as compared with baseline. Terfenadine and placebo had no effect on the clinical response or on the profiles of HR. In the NC group, the amounts of histamine recovered at 1 hour after challenge with compound 48/80 were lower than amounts of the pretherapy values (p less than 0.01). It could be concluded that (1) the profile of HR in patients with CU is reproducible during a period of 28 days, (2) only hydroxyzine modifies both the clinical response and the profile of HR, and (3) anti-H1 compounds decrease the HR in the NC group.\r"

Subjects were 151 consecutive, elderly, community-living persons discharged from two acute hospitals to SNFs after surgery for a hip fracture. Medical, functional, psychological, social, and outcome data were collected from hospital and nursing home charts. Ninety-seven subjects (64%) were discharged home within 6 months; 50 (33%) became permanent SNF residents; and four died. Multiple logistic regression identified orientation, younger age, ability to bathe independently, family involvement, ability to ambulate or transfer independently, and greater number of available physical therapy hours as factors contributing independently to returning home. Likelihood of returning home increased from 7% among subjects with fewer than two of the patient characteristics to 82% among subjects with four or more characteristics (P less than .0005). These results suggest that hip fracture patients at high risk of permanent SNF placement can be identified at time of hospital discharge. Investigations are needed to determine whether more intensive rehabilitation and discharge planning may improve the chance of returning home for a large percent of hip fracture patients.\r"

The major subset uses the V gamma 9 and the V delta 2 gene segments and the minor subset the V delta 1 gene segments in its functional TCR rearrangement. Upon in vitro activation, these TCR-gamma delta lymphocytes display MHC-unrestricted lytic activity, against a wide variety of tumor cells of distinct histologic origin. Here we show that fresh TCR-gamma delta lymphocytes that express a V gamma 9-V delta 2 encoded TCR display a specific proliferative response to Daudi, Burkitt's lymphoma cells. Moreover, cloned V gamma 9-V delta 2 lymphocytes show the capacity to lyse Daudi cells, whereas none of the cloned V gamma 1 TCR-gamma delta lymphocytes shows such specificity. Nucleotide diversity at the V-D-J junction of the TCR-V delta 2 gene did not contribute to this Daudi cell specificity. Comparison of the MHC-unrestricted cytolytic capacities of the V gamma 9-V delta 2 and the V delta 1 clones using a panel of distinct types of tumor target cells showed that on average, the level of MHC unrestricted lysis of V gamma 9-V delta 2 clones against these tumor cells exceeded that of V delta 1 clones. However, in contrast to all these tumor cell lines, only the Daudi cells showed such an absolute distinction in susceptibility to lysis by V gamma 9-V delta 2 and V delta 1 clones. V gamma 9-V delta 2 clones that were generated with a stimulator cell other than Daudi did not lyse their stimulator cells but nevertheless showed specific cytolysis of Daudi cells. The specific proliferation to and cytolysis of Daudi cells of the entire V gamma 9-V delta 2 subpopulation of TCR-gamma delta lymphocytes is reminiscent of a superantigen response.\r"

  ".W": "The T cell populations present in normal murine bone marrow have not been previously analyzed in detail, mainly because of their relative rarity. In order to permit such analyses, bone marrow T cells were enriched by depleting Mac1-positive cells, which constitute 65 to 90% of bone marrow cells (BMC), and then studied by two-color flow cytometry. Analysis of the remaining cells revealed that the T cell profile of adult murine bone marrow is markedly different from that of other lymphoid organs. A very high proportion of bone marrow CD3+ cells (approximately one-third) are CD4-CD8-. CD3+CD4-CD8- cells are much more concentrated among BMC T cells than among thymocytes or splenic T cells, suggesting that bone marrow may be either a site of extrathymic TCR gene rearrangement, or a major site to which such cells home from the thymus. The expression of NK1.1 was also evaluated on Mac1-depleted BMC populations. Surprisingly, up to 39% of alpha beta TCR+ BMC were found to express NK1.1. Most alpha beta TCR+NK1.1+ BMC also expressed CD4 or CD8. NK1.1+ alpha beta TCR+ cells represented a much greater proportion of BMC T cells than of other lymphoid (splenocyte or thymocyte) T cell populations. Mac1-depleted BMC of nude mice contained very few cells with this phenotype. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NK1.1+ alpha beta TCR+ cells are generated primarily in the thymus of normal animals and migrate preferentially to bone marrow, where they may function as regulatory elements in hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "Autoimmune diseases are known to be induced in some donor-recipient combinations of mice undergoing the graft-vs-host reaction (GVHR). In this paper, we report on the development of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)-like hepatic lesions and also on pancreatic insulitis in (B6 x bm12)F1 mice injected with B6 CD4+ T cells. At the sites of these lesions, cellular infiltration around ductal structure was observed. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were present in the lesions of the liver and pancreas. To clarify the role of the CD8+ T cells, which were probably of host origin, we used a mAb against the Lyt-2 molecule. Both the PBC-like hepatic lesions and pancreatic insulitis were exacerbated by eliminating CD8+ T cells from mice with MHC class II GVHR. Also, autoantibodies against the pyruvate dehydrogenase-E2 component, which has been recently found to contain an immunodominant site (autoepitope) for B cell reactivity in patients with PBC, were detected in the sera of these mice by ELISA and their presence was confirmed by immunoblotting procedures. Our findings suggest that similar mechanisms as in GVHR caused by MHC class II disparity are active in the development of PBC. It should also be noted that, in addition to the hepatic lesions, insulitis closely resembling that seen in the nonobese diabetic mouse was induced in our experimental system. The results suggest that our model provides a unique opportunity to study organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Because the effector in our experimental system was defined to be CD4+ T cells responding to Iabm12 Ag, our findings support the hypothesis that an excessive immune response directed against Ia Ag can produce autoimmune disease.\r"

Local bone-resorbing agents such as IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and LPS greatly induced IL-6 mRNA expression in both MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblast-like cells. Parathyroid hormone slightly increased expression of IL-6 mRNA in primary osteoblast-like cells but not in MC3T3-E1 cells. Neither IL-6 nor 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased expression of IL-6 mRNA in either of the osteoblast-like cells. In agreement with the expression of IL-6 mRNA, biologically active IL-6 was produced in response to the treatment with IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and LPS in MC3T3-E1 cells. Adding IL-6 dose dependently stimulated the release of 45Ca from prelabeled fetal mouse calvaria. Simultaneously adding suboptimal concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1 alpha induced bone resorption cooperatively. In accord with the increase in the release of 45Ca by IL-6, there were three times as many osteoclasts in the bone sections of calvaria cultured with IL-6 for 5 days as in the controls. IL-6 slightly suppressed alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells. These results indicate that IL-6 is also produced by osteoblasts, preferentially in response to local bone-resorbing agents, and it induces bone resorption both alone and in concert with other bone-resorbing agents.\r"

  ".W": "IFN-gamma is an essential immunoregulatory lymphokine for a variety of immunologic functions including upregulation of MHC Ag. The elucidation of the structure, particularly the receptor binding domains, should further enhance our understanding of its mechanism of action, and provide a rational basis for modulation of its activity by alteration of its structure. A predicted model of murine IFN-gamma structure has been constructed based on data derived from our synthetic peptide studies, circular dichroism spectra, and predictive algorithms for secondary structure, surface accessibility, and tertiary structure, as well as predicted structural similarities to IL-2. Direct synthetic peptide competition studies using five overlapping peptides that encompassed the entire IFN-gamma sequence of 133 amino acids showed that only the N-terminus of IFN-gamma, IFN-gamma(1-39), blocked binding to receptor, suggesting that the N-terminus is directly involved in receptor binding. Rabbit antibodies to the N-terminal (IFN-gamma(1-39)) and C-terminal (IFN-gamma(95-133)) peptides neutralized IFN-gamma activity, whereas antibodies to the three peptides that spanned the internal region, sequence 36-107, were without effect. Thus, the antibody data support the involvement of the N-terminus as a receptor binding domain and also suggest that the C-terminus of the molecule is also a binding domain. Predictive algorithms assign six alpha-helices and five turns to the molecule and circular dichroism spectra of both intact human and murine IFN-gamma and synthetic peptides of murine IFN-gamma showed that the molecule is mainly alpha-helical in structure. Drawing mainly on the four alpha-helix bundle model, a common motif in globular proteins such as IFN-gamma and IL-2 (whose crystalline structure is known), we constructed a simple model of the tertiary structure of IFN-gamma that fits well with our synthetic peptide and circular dichroism data. The model consists of the four-alpha-helical bundle along with N- and C-terminal helices that are predicted to be closely associated and together form the receptor binding domains. The model presented should contribute to further understanding the molecular basis of IFN-gamma action and allow us to begin modulating the function of IFN-gamma through the design of agonists and antagonists.\r"

Using cDNA probes for human IL-6, granulocyte-monocyte-CSF, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), we identified mRNA for these cytokines by RNA blot analysis of total RNA preparations derived from TE cells. We demonstrated that TE cells produced IL-6 transcripts and that TE cell culture supernatants contained IL-6 biologic activity, as determined by the ability to support proliferation of the T1165 plasmacytoma line. The 1.0-kilobase (kb) transcript of granulocyte-monocyte-CSF was also detected in TE cell-derived total RNA. TE cell culture supernatants contained LIF activity, as determined by proliferation of the murine cell line DA-1a, and a 4.0-kb LIF transcript was detected in TE cell-derived total RNA preparations. The 4.0-kb LIF transcript from TE cell-derived total RNA corresponded in size to the LIF transcripts in PMA-activated T lymphocytes. Thus, using biologic assays and RNA blot analysis, we demonstrated that cultured normal human TE cells produced both immunoregulatory cytokines and cytokines that drive various differentiation stages of human hematopoiesis. Our findings support the hypothesis that TE cells may play a role in providing cytokines that are important for the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells that migrate to the thymus during fetal and postnatal human thymic development.\r"

Preincubation for 2 h with 100 and 200 U/ml of IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha/beta, respectively, inhibited PMC cytotoxicity against WEHI-164 target cells. Lower concentrations of IFN-gamma (12.5 U/ml) and IFN-alpha/beta (25 U/ml) inhibited cytotoxicity of PMC after 8 h preincubation. The inhibitory effect of IFN was concentration and time dependent. In contrast to cytotoxicity, the release of histamine by PMC was not stimulated by the target cells WEHI-164 and there was no correlation between histamine release and cytotoxic activity of PMC. Specific antibody to subclasses of IFN prevented the inhibition of PMC cytotoxic activity, but preincubation with antibodies to the alternate subclass of IFN did not affect the observed inhibition. Moreover, the presence of both subclasses of IFN showed an additive inhibition of PMC cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic activity of PMC can be completely inhibited by the addition of anti-TNF during the assay. At high concentrations (400 U/ml), IFN inhibited the release of TNF from PMC. In the presence of RNA or protein synthesis inhibitors, IFN did not inhibit cytotoxicity of PMC further. We postulate that IFN may alter gene expression in mast cells in a manner that down-regulates their functions.\r"

  ".W": "To determine roles of MHC class I and II genes in protection against Toxoplasma gondii, H-2 congenic and mutant mice were infected perorally with bradyzoites of T. gondii and brain cysts were enumerated 30 days later. As B10 mice (H-2b) are cyst susceptible and B10.A mice (H-2a) are cyst resistant, B10 congenic mice having the same alleles but different H-2 haplotypes were used to locate the controlling gene. Genes located at H-2L (i.e., class I genes) were found to regulate the number of brain cysts which form following peroral infection with T. gondii (p less than 0.001) with Ld being resistant and Lb being susceptible. The regulatory function of the H-2L gene product was confirmed through the study of D mutant (dm) mice. B10.D2-H-2dm1 (dm1) mice have a gain-loss mutation in Dd and Ld (i.e., recombination of Ld and Dd) and BALB/c-H-2dm2 (dm2) mice have a deletion of the Ld gene. Both these dm strains were cyst susceptible (p less than 0.001). These results provide the first direct evidence that class I genes regulate numbers of T. gondii cysts that form. In vivo ablation of CD8+ T cells with mAb YTS 169.4 converted cyst resistant B10.BAR12 mice to cyst susceptible. This result is consistent with a role for MHC restricted CD8+ cytotoxic (or suppressor) T cell regulation of cyst formation. A mutation in Ia in B6.C-H-2bm12 (bm12) mice amplified cyst numbers in susceptible mice, which is consistent with the importance of helper/inducer T cells in the induction of cytotoxic T cells. These findings are relevant to understanding the complex immunologic mechanisms that protect against T. gondii infection, development of protective preparations, and provide a conceptual basis for determining whether similar immunogenetic regulation of susceptibility is also operative in humans.\r"

In many other cells their expression can be induced by IFN-gamma. Conserved upstream promoter sequences regulate this tissue-specific expression of class II genes. In the DRA promoter, one of these cis-acting regulatory motifs is the X2-box to which nuclear factor X2 (NF-X2) binds. Here, we present the isolation and characterization of the full-length cDNA clone encoding NF-X2. This cDNA clone was isolated by expression cDNA cloning, and encodes the human c-Jun protein, which together with c-Fos forms the heterodimeric activator protein-1 transcription complex. Whereas c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers do not exist in B cells, they form and bind to the X2-box in class II nonexpressing cells. Thus, c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers might contribute to the repression of DRA gene expression.\r"

Four nominal allotypic variants designated b4, b5, b6, and b9 have been found to be co-dominantly expressed at the C kappa 1 gene locus. Latent allotypes are nonallelic and appear as unexpected and transitory molecules in the serum as well as on B cell surfaces. To determine the mechanism of latent kappa 1 allotype expression, rabbits were initially induced to produce latent b5 and b6 allotypes by infection with Trypanosoma brucei and RNA was extracted from the lymph nodes of these rabbits. The polymerase chain reaction using allele specific oligonucleotide primers was used to detect and amplify the mRNA encoding the latent b5 and b6 sequences. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned products revealed that the latent b5 and b6 cDNA sequences were identical to their nominal allelic counterparts, b5 and b6, respectively. Thus, the identification of transcripts encoding latent b5 and b6 sequences rules out serologic artifacts and idiotypic mimicry as explanations of latent allotype expression.\r"

Tissue plasminogen activator is also detectable immunocytochemically in lesional psoriatic but not normal epidermis. Similarly, mRNA for tPA is observed in lesional epidermis only. These results suggest that lesional psoriatic epidermis synthesizes enhanced levels of tPA compared to normal. Additional data support the hypothesis that enhanced tPA may be another marker common to psoriatic epidermis, epidermis during wound repair, and keratinocytes in culture. The significance of elevated tPA in psoriatic lesions is presently unclear, but its possible relationship to epidermal proliferation and cutaneous inflammation is under study.\r"

Lesional epidermis from patients with psoriasis, pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, and Hailey-Hailey disease contains elevated levels of tissue-type PA (tPA) activity compared to non-lesional epidermis or to epidermis from normal individuals. In the present study, we have used Northern blot analysis to demonstrate that mRNA for tPA is detectable in lesions from patients with psoriasis, pemphigus, and bullous pemphigoid, but is not detectable in normal epidermis. These data strongly suggest that the tPA enzymatic activity present in lesional epidermis results from enhanced synthesis of the enzyme in situ, secondary to elevated steady-state levels of tPA mRNA. Cultured keratinocytes likewise are shown to contain tPA mRNA. Previous investigators have suggested that the phenotypes of keratinocytes in culture, psoriatic epidermis, and epidermis in the process of wound reepithelialization are comparable. Our findings, combined with those of other investigators, suggest that elevated tPA expression may be another common feature of epidermis under these circumstances.\r"

Tyrosinase was detected in all skin samples with the highest levels in skin type IV and the lowest levels in skin type I. Following psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy for several weeks, significant increases in the amounts of tyrosinase were found in skin types III and IV. The presence of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) (100 mumol/l) or the long-acting analogue [Nle4, DPhe7] alpha-MSH (1-10 mumol/l) in the incubation medium failed to alter tyrosinase levels in the skin biopsies taken from patients both before and after receiving PUVA therapy. Bromo-adenosine 3,5-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt (8-bromo-cAMP) (10 mmol/l), on the other hand, increased the amounts of tyrosinase both before and after PUVA, but these effects were only seen in biopsies of type III and IV skin. These results indicate that MSH fails to stimulate tyrosinase synthesis in human melanocytes. Nevertheless, tyrosinase synthesis and its regulation by cyclic AMP-dependent mechanisms could be important control points in the pigmentary response.\r"

Because human nidogen gene has been mapped to chromosomal locus 1q43 in the human genome, we examined the possibility that nidogen, an integral component of all basement membranes, would be the candidate gene in this family of EBS2. Restriction fragment-length polymorphism, which was shown with several restriction endonucleases to be present within the nidogen gene, was utilized for linkage analyses. The results using an informative PvuII polymorphism as a marker of allelic inheritance supported exclusion of the EBS2 locus from approximately 10 cM in either side of the nidogen locus, when Lod score of -2.0 was taken as the limit of exclusion. This study demonstrates the feasibility of examining other families with EB for possible linkage to the nidogen locus.\r"

Elevated expression of the c-myc gene was also detected in two long-term cultured melanoma cell lines (RPMI 7951 and SKMEL-30). Analysis of c-myc expression by in situ hybridization in HM1 cells showed that expression was not localized to a sub-population of cycling cells and all cells were overexpressing c-myc mRNA.

  ".W": "Despite recent advances in the understanding of normal T lymphocyte immunobiology, there has been little progress in characterizing the non-HTLV cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and leukemias (CTCL) Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary syndrome. The two major impediments to in vitro studies of these malignancies have been the contamination of CTCL cells with normal T cells and the inability to induce a vigorous proliferative response or establish long-term cultures with standard T-cell mitogens. The ideal reagent for identifying CTCL cells in a given patient would be tumor specific. Although a monoclonal antibody to the clonotypic antigen receptor on CTCL cells would approach this ideal, it is not currently feasible to generate such antibodies for each CTCL patient. As a compromise, we chose to test an \"almost clonotypic\" reagent by examining whether monoclonal antibodies directed at the variable (V) region of the T-cell antigen receptor could be applied to CTCL. We identified three Sezary patients, who by standard T-cell phenotype and Southern blot analysis for clonality had a virtually pure peripheral blood population of leukemic cells (PBL). We then screened the PBL of these patients with a panel of seven commercially available monoclonal anti-V region antibodies and found one patients' cells reacted greater than 99% with alpha V beta 5. The other patients' cells were non-reactive. In addition, we utilized a solid-phase system to cross-link V beta 5 on the one CTCL patients' PBL cells, and found that they proliferated vigorously in the presence of 10 units of IL-2 and IL-4. Parallel cultures have been maintained for one month by restimulation twice a week. These findings suggest that anti-V region antibodies should prove useful for investigating the immunobiology of CTCL.\r"

To facilitate monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy, a rapid, new flow cytometric assay (FCA) lymphocyte p24-FCA, has been devised to quantify peripheral blood lymphocytes expressing cell-associated HIV-1 p24 antigen. Results from 55 asymptomatic, HIV-1-seropositive, serum p24 antigen-negative individuals ranged from undetectable (less than 0.1%) to 13.6% p24+ lymphocytes (mean, 2.0%). Mean values for three other groups studied were 0.1% for seronegative, viral culture-negative laboratory workers (n = 24); 4.2% for untreated patients with AIDS (n = 16); and 0.3% for AIDS patients receiving zidovudine (n = 11). Lymphocyte p24-FCA values were inversely related to the number of days to positive viral cultures and to levels of CD4+ lymphocytes. The ratio of p24+ lymphocytes to CD4+ lymphocytes may reflect the fraction of infected CD4+ lymphocytes. Lymphocyte p24-FCA determination may provide a method for monitoring response to antiretroviral therapy regardless of serum p24 antigen status.\r"

  ".W": "To predict the efficacy of antibiotics in eliminating nasopharyngeal carriage of organisms such as Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a novel approach for measuring drug concentrations in nasal secretions was developed. Five healthy individuals received four doses of rifampin and then, at a later date, ciprofloxacin. At 2, 5, and 8 h after the last dose, serum, saliva, and cold-stimulated nasal secretion samples were collected, and drug levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Nasopharyngeal levels of rifampin reached but did not substantially exceed 90% of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) for H. influenzae, exceeded the MIC90 for N. meningitidis, and were well above that for MRSA. Ciprofloxacin levels in nasal secretions far exceeded the MIC90 for meningococci and Haemophilus organisms but were below that for MRSA. These findings are consistent with the clinical studies showing that rifampin eliminates, in most instances, the nasal carriage of N. meningitidis and to a lesser extent H. influenzae. A single dose of ciprofloxacin has been shown to eradicate meningococci, yet a long course of treatment with this drug is not adequate for MRSA. On the basis of these results, clinical trials with ciprofloxacin to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of H. influenzae appear to be warranted.\r"

Specific IgG3 antibodies were undetectable or present only in low amounts in children less than 4 years old but were an important constituent of the response of older children. OMPs prepared from different isolates had similar molecular masses and bound IgG with identical immunoblotting patterns. Binding appeared subclass-specific, with IgG3 binding to the broadest range of OMPs. These findings should provide a better understanding of the pathogenic role of this organism and suggest possible strategies for the development of a vaccine.\r"

Cells incubated with metabolically active rickettsiae secreted significantly more PGI2 and PGE2 than did those incubated with buffer alone or with killed rickettsiae. The amount of PGI2 secreted was directly related to the number of hemolytically active rickettsiae present; abolishing rickettsial hemolytic activity abolished their effect on PGI2 secretion. Mice injected with a lethal dose of native typhus rickettsiae exhibited a rapid rise in circulating PGI2 levels; mice given hemolytically inactive rickettsiae survived and exhibited no rise in plasma PGI2 levels. Finally, endothelial cells were infected with rickettsiae, and secretion of prostaglandins was monitored during rickettsial multiplication; intracellular accumulation of rickettsiae resulted in endothelial destruction and a dramatic increase in endothelial secretion of PGI2 and PGE2. Therefore, typhus rickettsiae can increase endothelial secretion of arachidonate-derived autocoids.\r"

The patients were interviewed extensively for potential risk factors associated with transmission. Of the 203 patients with type B hepatitis, 34 (30 men, 4 women) showed serologic evidence of acute HDV infection (HDV+ group), while the other 169 did not (HDV- group). Of the 30 HDV+ men, 27 (90%) had had sexual intercourse with prostitutes within 3 months of admission, while only 31 (22.7%) of the 136 HDV- men, 8 (17.4%) of the 46 men with non-A, non-B hepatitis and 5 (8.3%) of the 60 control men had done so (P less than .001). Of the 4 HDV+ women, 1 was a prostitute and another was the wife of a patient with active HDV infection. There was no significant difference in exposure to other risk factors among these groups of patients. The results suggest that heterosexual exposure, particularly prostitute contact, is the most important route of HDV transmission in the general population of this area endemic for HBV infection.\r"

Only 15 patients failed to develop antihantaviral antibodies; most sera contained high titered IgM antibody on admission, and all were IgM-seropositive by day 7 after onset. Attempts to detect hantaviral antigen were unsuccessful. All seropositive patients had highest plaque reduction neutralization titers to Hantaan virus, suggesting that this virus was responsible for the disease seen. These results confirm that hemorrhagic fever of the Korean Conflict was due to Hantaan virus and demonstrate that measurement of specific IgM antibody is the method of choice for diagnosis of acute disease.\r"

This rapid clearance correlates with a striking influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils that is of equal magnitude in both C5+ and C5- animals. Supernatant from Todd-Hewitt broth culture of B. catarrhalis exhibits in vivo chemotactic activity in the murine lung and in vitro chemotactic activity in Boyden chambers.

Interferon was also present in secretions of women with gonorrhea. Higher levels were seen in secretions from older women with positive chlamydial cultures. Interferon levels in secretions did not correlate with simultaneous plasma levels, the number of organisms recovered in tissue culture, or clinical correlates of inflammation. These data suggest that interferon-gamma is present at the site of chlamydial infection; however, further experiments are needed to determine whether interferon is specifically involved in protection or is a nonspecific indicator of inflammation.\r"

Percentages of lymphocytes with B1, T11, T3, T4, T8, T6, B4, Ia, NKH phenotypes and T4 to T8 ratios of infected and uninfected babies were the same (p greater than 0.05). Lymphocytes from congenitally infected babies had lower blastogenic responses (mean stimulation index [SI] = 5) to Toxoplasma lysate antigens (TLA) than lymphocytes from adult control groups with recent and chronic infection (Mean SIs = 32, 72; p less than 0.001). Compared to infected adults, congenitally infected children had similar or greater responses to concanavalin A (mean SIs = 94; 118, 76, p greater than 0.05) and in mixed leukocyte culture (mean SIs = 63; 22, 26, p greater than 0.05). For symptomatic babies, low blastogenic response to TLA correlated with more severe disease at presentation (p = 0.002). Lymphocyte blastogenic responses to TLA were increased for most children when they were older than 15 months, but responses remained less than adult levels for 9 of the 17 older children studied. There was no correlation between concomitant serum pyrimethamine levels and lymphocyte blastogenic responses to TLA. Pyrimethamine and sulfonamide treatment in vitro and in vivo did not alter lymphocyte response to TLA. Lymphocytes from congenitally infected babies failed to produce either gamma interferon or Interleukin 2 when cultured with TLA. In contrast, they produced these lymphokines when cultured with concanavalin A or phytohemagglutinin. Specific deficits in cell-mediated immune responses to TLA may account for the significant organ damage that occurs in infants and children with congenital toxoplasmosis.\r"

The ventral roots at segmental levels L7 and S1 of treated nondeformed fetuses (TND) and deformed fetuses, demonstrated significant reductions (20-30%) of four of the parameters measured; total fascicular area (TFA), myelinated axon number (AN), Schwann cell counts (SCC) and axoplasmic area. In the dorsal roots of treated animals, thalidomide affected primarily segmental level S2, where significant reductions (15-30%) were observed in three parameters (TFA, AN, SCC). The occurrence of significant reductions in these measures in TND fetuses may indicate a neurotoxic action for thalidomide in the embryo. Despite apparent reductions in Schwann cell numbers in dorsal and ventral nerve roots, analyses of axon caliber and myelin sheath thickness indicated no evidence for any effects of thalidomide on the myelination of either sensory or motor axons. The segmental distribution of the axonal lesion, being maximal at segmental levels L7 and S1 in the ventral roots and at segmental level S2 in the dorsal roots, indicates a discrete period during development when nervous tissue is susceptible to the effects of thalidomide. The results of this study suggest thalidomide may have effects on neural development as well as on limb development.\r"

  ".W": "With conventional immunocytochemical techniques on fixed tissue, antibodies which recognize highly phosphorylated neurofilament proteins strongly label axons, but often react poorly with perikaryal neurofilaments. The reactivity of one such antibody, SMI31, with neurofilaments in vivo has been investigated by microinjecting purified SMI31 into large neurons in living cultures of embryonic mouse spinal cord. Microinjected SMI31 (SMI31I) labeled perikarya and dendrites in a fibrillar pattern indistinguishable from that of microinjected SMI32 (SMI32I), which labels hypophosphorylated neurofilaments of perikarya and dendrites in fixed tissue. SMI31 also labeled perikarya and dendrites when applied to whole unfixed cultures after extraction with 1% Triton X-100 or to cultures fixed in acetone after Triton-extraction, but prior to exposure to primary antibody. SMI31 labeled mainly axons when applied after fixation with acetone without Triton-extraction. Positive labeling of neurofilaments and various inclusions in neuronal somata with antibodies against highly phosphorylated neurofilaments has been described in a number of neurotoxic and neurodegenerative diseases and after neuronal injury. The results of this study indicate that explanations other than alterations in phosphorylation could account for these observations.\r"

  ".W": "To further improve the effect of high-dose chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer, we sought to develop a second active high-dose noncross-resistant regimen to use in tandem with our customary high-dose regimen of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (CVP). We performed a phase II trial of high-dose mitoxantrone 30 mg/m2, etoposide 200 mg/m2 every 12 hours x 6, and thiotepa 250 mg/m2 x 3 days (MVT) in 31 patients with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer and one with locally advanced chemotherapy-refractory breast cancer. These patients were ineligible for high-dose CVP chemotherapy because of the amount of prior treatment and poor-response status. Of the 32 patients, 14 responded to cycle 1, did not experience any grade 4 toxicity, and received a second cycle of MVT. Overall, seven of 31 patients achieved a complete response (CR; 23%). Four of the 14, who were partial responders to the first cycle, achieved a CR after the second cycle. The overall response rate was 19 of 31 (61%) with an overall median freedom from progression of 4 to 5 months and an overall median survival of 9 months. Toxicity consisted primarily of mucositis (grade 3 or 4 in 69%). The results indicate that high-dose MVT produces significant activity, even in heavily pretreated patients. Administration of a second cycle of high-dose therapy with MVT increased the CR rate, and the morbidity and mortality from the second cycle were not greater than that for the first cycle. Because of the high incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis with this regimen, we are currently completing a follow-up study of high-dose mitoxantrone and thiotepa alone.\r"

  ".U": "91038171\r", 
  ".W": "From July 1986 to July 1989, 40 patients (92% pretreated) with deep-seated, advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS, 25 patients), Ewing's sarcomas (ES, eight patients), osteosarcomas (OS, three patients) and chondrosarcomas (ChS, four patients) were treated at the University of Munich in a protocol involving regional hyperthermia (RHT) combined with ifosfamide plus etoposide. A total of 265 RHT treatments (mean, 6.6 RHT per patient) were applied including 33 pelvic, four extremity, and three abdominal sites. The mean tumor volume was 537 cc (range, 50 to 2,980 cc). For systemic chemotherapy, all patients received ifosfamide (1.5 g/m2, days 1 to 5), etoposide (100 mg/m2, days 1, 3, and 5), and mesna (300 mg/m2 x 4, days 1 to 5) with RHT given only on days 1 and 5 in repeated cycles every 4 weeks. Acute toxicity consisted primarily of pain (57%) combined with local discomfort within the annular phased array applicator (AA) of the BSD hyperthermia system (BSD Medical Corp, Salt Lake City, UT). The average maximum systemic temperature was 37.4 +/- 0.5 degrees C, and there was no indication of enhanced bone marrow toxicity due to the addition of RHT to the systemic chemotherapy. Detailed thermal mapping by invasive thermometry was performed in all patients. In 38 assessable patients, the overall objective response rate was 37%: six complete responses (CRs), four partial responses (PRs), and four favorable histologic responses (FHRs) (95% confidence limits, 22% to 54%). Complete responders are alive and disease-free at 40, 35, 23, 19, 19, and 8 months. Of patients with PR and FHR, two died from metastatic disease after 4 and 17 months and one died from other disease after 27 months. The remaining five patients are stable at 37, 25, 21, 13, and 8 months. Eleven patients showed no change (NC), and 13 patients showed local tumor progression (PD). The mean observation time for all patients was 11.6 months. The time-averaged temperatures (Ts) of all RHT treatments calculated as 20% (T20), 50% (T50), or 90% (T90) of measured tumor sites differed significantly between responders and nonresponders (T20, P = .003; T50, P = .006; and T90, P = .004; respectively). These data support activity for ifosfamide-etoposide combined with RHT in pretreated patients with advanced sarcomas.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-one patients with bidimensionally measurable hormone-refractory prostatic cancer received trimetrexate (TMTX). Serial values of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and acid phosphatase (SAP) were correlated with response. Five patients (17%; 95% confidence interval, 3% to 30%) achieved a partial remission for a median of 3 months (range, 3 to 7.5 months). Marker levels showed large variations with no discernible patterns. Serial PSA and SAP in 19 patients with abnormal baseline values showed a correlation with measurable disease response in only 68% (13 of 19) and 47% (nine of 19) of patients, respectively. Values were then smoothed using an exploratory data analysis technique of running medians and averages. Trends in marker changes were much more apparent. Several \"decision rules\" were evaluated for use of markers as indices of disease progression. A 50% increase from the patient's minimum value in either PSA or SAP on two successive determinations correlated with progression in 90% of cases in this trial. TMTX has modest activity in prostatic cancer, and further trials are not warranted. Biochemical markers do not uniformly reflect disease activity in hormone-refractory disease, and changes in biochemical markers must be interpreted cautiously when used as the sole end point to assess efficacy in clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "Testicular function was evaluated in 60 long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). All the patients were treated on two consecutive Children Cancer Study Group protocols and received identical chemotherapy and either 18 or 24 Gy radiation therapy (RT) to one of the following fields: craniospinal plus 12 Gy abdominal RT including the gonads (group 1); craniospinal (group 2); or cranial (group 3). The median age at the time of their last evaluation was 14.5 years (range, 10.5 to 25.7), which took place a median of 5.0 years (range, 1 to 10.3) after discontinuing therapy. The incidence of primary germ cell dysfunction as judged by raised levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or reduced testicular volume was significantly associated with field of RT; 55% of group 1, 17% of group 2, and 0% of group 3 were abnormal (P = .002). Leydig cell function, as assessed by plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone, and pubertal development, was unaffected in the majority of subjects regardless of RT field. These data indicate that in boys undergoing therapy for ALL, germ cell dysfunction is common following testicular irradiation and can occur following exposure to scattered irradiation from craniospinal RT. In contrast, Leydig cell function appears resistant to direct irradiation with doses as high as 12 Gy.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty patients with advanced measurable pancreatic adenocarcinoma were entered onto a phase II trial with recombinant interferon gamma (Biogen, Cambridge, MA; 10(6) U/m2 daily for 4 days) and monoclonal antibody (Mab) 17-1A (Centocor, Malvern, PA; 150 mg in autologous leukocytes on days 2, 3, and 4 following interferon infusion). The effect of a single interferon gamma treatment on natural and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), Fc receptor occupancy by antibody, and human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression on monocytes and lymphocytes was also studied. Toxicity was modest and generally limited to grade I to II fever, nausea and vomiting, and hepatotoxicity. Five patients were considered to be nonassessable for response. Of the 25 assessable patients, one objective response (complete remission for a duration of 4 months) was observed. Stable disease for 2 months or greater was noted in nine patients. The median survival for the group was 5 months. Analysis of cytotoxicity data obtained prior to treatment showed reduced natural cytotoxic activity in these patients compared with normal volunteers. A significant improvement in natural cytotoxic activity to normal levels occurred within 24 hours following the interferon gamma infusion. This was also associated with augmented antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Although HLA-DR expression was not increased on either monocytes or lymphocytes, an increased capacity of both lymphocytes and monocytes to bind Mab 17-1A was observed. In all in vitro assays of ADCC, the presence of antibody excess was associated with improved cytolytic activity. In spite of the favorable modulation of cytolytic activity and improved ability of effector cells to bind Mab, we failed to demonstrated adequate clinical efficacy in the treatment of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma using this dose and schedule of interferon gamma and Mab 17-1A. Future trials will focus on alternate schedules of Mab 17-1A with the hope of improving tumor antigen saturation and circulating levels of infused antibody.\r"

Thyroglobulin levels were measured in 61 patients receiving L-thyroxine therapy after thyroidectomy, and again after suspension of therapy, before performing a whole-body scan with iodine-131. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of thyroglobulin levels, measured during L-thyroxine therapy, for diagnosis of tumor residue or metastases were then calculated and compared with results obtained by diagnostic whole-body scanning. Our data show that neither thyroglobulin levels nor whole-body scans alone can discriminate between patients with or without metastases. Sensitivity reached 95.7%, specificity 100%, and accuracy 96.7% if results of both procedures were also taken into consideration. We conclude that in the management and follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma both parameters need to be evaluated.\r"

Relevant problems include poor health status and disproportionately high expenditures for medical care, inappropriate mix and distribution of medical manpower, and insufficient attention to chronic illness and disability. To help address these problems, Health of the Public, funded jointly by the Pew Charitable Trusts and the Rockefeller Foundation, has established programs in six academic health centers: Columbia; Johns Hopkins; Tufts; and the Universities of New Mexico, North Carolina, and Washington.

These options are: 1) fee-for-service; 2) a periodic preventive health visit fee; 3) capitation; and 4) a preventive services account. The report concludes with recommendations for constructing an equitable system for increasing access to preventive services. A multi-pronged approach is recommended involving improvements in public and private coverage of these services; development of a periodic preventive health visit fee payment mechanism; initiation of additional research and demonstration efforts designed to determine cost-effectiveness of services and payment approaches; and modifications to the current coding system that would lead to a more appropriate method for reimbursement of preventive care services.\r"

There was a highly significant reduction (p less than 0.001) in the tcPCO2 values and croup scores after inhalation of epinephrine. The changes in the tcPCO2 values correlated with the clinical findings. Mild sedation also significantly improved the croup scores but failed to influence the tcPCO2 values. There was not statistically significant difference in pulse oximetry saturation, fraction of administered oxygen, heart rate, or respiratory rate before and after inhalation of epinephrine or chloral hydrate administration. Monitoring tcPCO2 appears to be a reliable and objective tool for managing patients with upper airway obstruction, whereas croup scores may be misleading.\r"

Six patients had obstructive apnea, four had hypoxemia (arterial oxygen saturation less than 90% while breathing room air), and four had hypoventilation (end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure greater than 45 mm Hg) before epiglottoplasty. Mean age (+/- SEM) at epiglottoplasty was 10.3 +/- 5.3 months. No patients had surgical complications. An endotracheal tube was in place for 25 +/- 7 hours postoperatively, and patients were discharged 4 +/- 1 days postoperatively. Polysomnography performed 2.8 +/- 1.0 months after surgery showed that all patients had improved. Two patients had residual, mild episodes of obstructive apnea, and one patient had mild hypoventilation and desaturation. No patient had further life-threatening events or required further hospitalizations after epiglottoplasty. We conclude that epiglottoplasty is an effective and safe treatment for a selected group of patients with severe laryngomalacia.\r"

  ".W": "Because we have noted discordant results in the measurement of IgG subclass concentrations by means of a widely available commercial radial immunodiffusion (RID) kit in comparison with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), we conducted in a blinded manner a comparison of the two assays, using sera from 48 healthy children. The correlation coefficients between the assays were 0.92, 0.82, 0.93, and 0.86 for the IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 assays, respectively. However, the RID assay assigned lower values for IgG1 and IgG4 determinations than the ELISA did. Furthermore, the \"normal lower range values\" provided by the RID assay were higher for each IgG subclass. When the sera from the healthy control subjects were analyzed with the RID assay, 12 (25%) of 48 subjects had values below the normal range for at least one subclass measurement. In contrast, with the CDC ELISA, all values were within the 95% confidence limits determined for the CDC ELISA. We suggest that age-specific normal limits be established with the use of sera from many healthy subjects for any assay measuring IgG subclass concentrations. As new groups of immunodeficiencies are defined and potential therapies are advocated, careful attention to assay standardization will result in a clearer delineation of these disease groups and of their response to treatment.\r"

Enrollment was completed when the combined analysis reached the sequential design boundary indicating no treatment difference. Mortality rates (19% among infants receiving high-frequency jet ventilation vs 24% among infants receiving conventional ventilation), the incidence of air leaks (48% vs 52%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (39% vs 41%), and intraventricular hemorrhage (33% vs 43%), and assignment crossovers (14% vs 24%) did not differs significantly between the treatment groups.

Babies were fed a standard formula intraduodenally at 4 ml/kg/2 hr by infusion pump. Small bowel motility responded to feeding; fasting patterns were replaced with long periods of persistent activity. During the infusion of formula, there was no significant difference in motor activity between preterm and term infants. Four characteristics of motor activity changed with feeding: motility index, the number of pressure peaks per 30-minute period, mean amplitude of pressure peaks, and duration of periods of quiescence. The number of pressure peaks per 30-minute period was the most sensitive index of the motor response to feeding, and it was used to characterize the fed pattern response. The start and duration of the fed response were similar in both groups of infants. Thus, despite the presence of immaturity in fasting patterns, the intestine of the preterm infant responds appropriately to feeding. These data help explain why preterm infants usually tolerate antral feedings, and support their use.\r"

Seven considerations in the selection of an end point are observability, relevance, definition, time needed for observation, verifiability, variability, and implementability. We discuss these considerations and illustrate the principles with an example from a clinical trial conducted by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group.\r"

  ".W": "Preliminary data are presented of a clinically feasible pilot study to select a significant subgroup of patients among those with muscle-invading bladder tumors for local cure and bladder preservation, while also to offer all patients the possibility of preventing the development of distant metastases. Transurethral debulking surgical resection was combined with neoadjuvant methotrexate, cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy plus 2 additional courses of cisplatin and 4,000 cGy. If tumor was found on cystoscopic re-evaluation by biopsy and for cytology after cisplatin and partial irradiation (4,000 cGy.) immediate cystectomy was advised. If tumor was not found consolidation by a radiotherapy boost to a total of 6,480 cGy. plus 1 additional course of cisplatin was given. Of 53 consecutive patients the planned treatment was completed in 42 (79%). With a median followup of 26 months (range 15 to 42 months), 72% of all entered patients were alive, 70% have not required cystectomy and 74% have not had distant metastases. Among the 42 patients who completed the planned protocol chemotherapy dose reductions were required in 39% for stomatitis, bone marrow depression and/or renal dysfunction. There were 2 serious complications but no treatment-related sepsis, deaths or significant renal dysfunction. Eight patients underwent immediate radical cystectomy because of positive biopsy and/or cytology results after 4,000 cGy., while 34 completed full chemotherapy and radiotherapy without any significant bladder or bowel injury. Of 42 patients 22 (52%) have maintained the bladder without any recurrence, and of those selected for full chemotherapy and radiotherapy this number increased to 65%. To date 12 patients have persistent or recurrent bladder tumors: 5 (15%) had invasive tumors treated by cystectomy and 7 (21%) had carcinoma in situ treated by intravesical therapy. The true success of this or other selective bladder-preserving treatments will require 3 to 5 years of followup to be confident that such treatment has sterilized the bladder of cancer. This feasibility study has been clinically practical, modestly well tolerated and encouraging for the significant proportion of patients with a sustained complete response and for the 70% over-all survival rate at 2 years. To evaluate critically the efficacy of methotrexate, cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy in the prevention of occult distant micrometastases and in increasing the rate of successful bladder preservation, in May 1988 we began a randomized phase 3 trial with and without neoadjuvant methotrexate, cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy.\r"

Between September 1986 and December 1987 serial prostate specific antigen values were determined in 43 patients before and after definitive radiation therapy. The study group included 6 patients with stage T0d, 10 with stage T1, 11 with stage T2 and 16 with stage T3 disease, with a mean pre-treatment prostate specific antigen level of 49.2 +/- 10.8. For all patients the first post-treatment prostate specific antigen level was less than the pre-treatment level. One patient failed locally with recurrent prostatic cancer that invaded the rectum. The 6 patients who failed with symptomatic metastases had an increasing prostate specific antigen level 2 to 7 months before detection of recurrence. Based on the absolute value and trend of the prostate specific antigen, patients were described as being at high, intermediate or low risk for distant metastases. Of 9 high, 6 intermediate and 28 low risk patients 4 (44%), 2 (33%) and 0 (0%) have experienced recurrent disease (p = 0.0025). We conclude that serial post-irradiation prostate specific antigen values may be useful in the early identification of patients at risk for treatment failure.\r"

To confirm this we modified a commercially available radio-immunoassay for detection of this lymphokine in urine. The urinary levels of IFN gamma were compared in serial urine samples taken from six patients undergoing treatment with Evans strain BCG and seven patients receiving intravesical mitomycin C/epirubicin. IFN gamma was detected consistently in response to BCG with levels reaching a peak (mean 67.1 U/ml., range 7.9 to 155.9 U/ml.) four to six hours post-instillation whereas after other intravesical agents no IFN gamma was detectable after seven of 13 instillations. After the remaining six instillations lower levels were detected (mean 7.4 U/ml., range 0.6 to 22.4 U/ml.). The difference in peak levels between the two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.001 Mann Whitney U test). These results are further evidence of specific cellular immune activity in response to intravesical BCG therapy and suggest anti-tumour mechanisms similar to allograft rejection and autoimmunity.\r"

  ".W": "Struvite crystals were produced by Proteus mirabilis growth in artificial urine, in the presence of a number of naturally occurring crystallization inhibitors. The use of phase contrast light microscopy enabled the effects of added chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate C, heparin sulfate, or sodium citrate, on struvite crystal growth rates to be rapidly monitored as changes in crystal habit. Struvite crystals formed as a consequence of the urease activity of P. mirabilis under all chemical conditions. In the absence of inhibitor, early crystal development was marked by large quantities of amorphous precipitate, followed immediately by the appearance of rapidly growing X-shaped or planar crystals. Addition of the glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate C, or heparin sulfate to the artificial urine mixture had no effect on the rate of crystal growth or appearance. When sodium citrate was present in elevated concentrations, crystal appearance was generally slowed, and the crystals assumed an octahedral, slow growing appearance. None of the added compounds had any influence on bacterial viability, pH, or urease activity. It is therefore likely that the inhibitory activity displayed by sodium citrate might be related to its ability to complex magnesium or to interfere with the crystal structure during struvite formation. From these experiments it would appear that citrate may be a factor in the natural resistance of whole urine to struvite crystallization.\r"

A total of 73 patients was studied (6 with stage B2, 16 with stage C, 9 with stage D1 and 42 with stage D2 disease). Endocrine therapy included bilateral orchiectomy, diethylstilbestrol diphosphate and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue. Pre-treatment serum prostate specific antigen levels were determined in all patients with an enzyme immunoassay kit. During a followup of 4 to 68 months (average 24 months) clinical disease progression occurred in 24 of the 73 patients. The pre-treatment prostate specific antigen level by itself did not predict disease progression. Changes in prostate specific antigen level with treatment were correlated with the interval to disease progression in the 44 patients who had prostate specific antigen determinations at regular intervals after endocrine therapy and whose initial level was greater than 10 ng./ml. Patients who had a decrease in the prostate specific antigen levels of 80% or more within 1 month after the beginning of therapy survived significantly longer free of disease progression (p less than 0.001). Patients whose prostate specific antigen level remained elevated for more than 3 months had a high risk of disease progression within 2 years. Our study suggests that patients with the more favorable prognosis can be identified early, after 1 to 3 months of endocrine therapy, by the rapid decrease in the prostate specific antigen levels.\r"

With gradual refinements in staging and therapy the prognosis has improved. Between 1960 and 1988, 18 patients 2 to 18 years old were treated at the Children's Hospital. Management consisted of inguinal orchiectomy, staging evaluation and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy according to the stage of the disease. In 11 patients (61%) the disease was confined to the scrotum, while 7 presented with spread to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, including 3 children with more distant metastases. Histological study revealed predominantly embryonal characteristics except for 1 alveolar cell type. Chemotherapy consisted of actinomycin D in 2 patients, vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide in 2, pulse vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide in 10, and doxorubicin plus vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide in 4. A total of 17 patients remain free of disease (median followup 4 years) with 1 death. The actuarial survival without relapse and over-all survival rate are 89 and 94%, respectively. We conclude that paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma represents a favorable subgroup of rhabdomyosarcoma.\r"

Two patients are summarized who received luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy without flare blockade and died suddenly during month 1 of therapy. A review of 765 patients in 9 series found 10.9% who suffered disease flare and 15 who died during disease flare. Of these 17 patients 12 were similar to our 2. These data suggest that any patient placed on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for prostate cancer merits some form of flare blockade during the initial 1 or 2 months of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown earlier that the administration of cyclosporine impairs testicular function and causes a decrease in sperm counts, sperm motility and fertility. In order to determine whether or not the deleterious effects of CsA could be reversed by hormonal therapy, we injected sexually mature male Sprague Dawley rats with cremaphor + saline or CsA (40 mg./kg./d) alone or in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; five micrograms./d/rat) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH; five micrograms./d/rat). The injections were given subcutaneously for 14 days. As expected, CsA administration decreased the body and reproductive organ weights, testicular and epididymal sperm counts, sperm motility and fertilizing ability. Serum levels of LH were elevated and testosterone was decreased. The administration of FSH + hCG to the CsA treated rats restored the body and reproductive organ weights, sperm counts and motility. Seventy five percent of gonadotropin treated males were fertile as compared to 25% in the CsA treated group. In the hormone treated group, the blood levels of CsA were 50% of that of CsA treated group. In order to verify whether or not the decline in the blood levels of CsA was the cause for the amelioration of CsA-induced changes in the reproductive function, we compared the CsA + hormone treated group with another group treated with five mg./kg./d CsA which had blood levels of CsA comparable to the former group. In the five mg./kg./d group the reproductive functions were significantly lower than the CsA + hormone treated group suggesting, therefore, that the restoration of reproductive functions in the CsA + hormone treated group is a result of hormonal treatment. Administration of CsA (40 mg./kg./d) reduced the kidney weight and increased the levels of serum creatinine: these changes were also ameliorated by the administration of hCG + FSH.\r"

Dihydropyridine (DHP) binding sites have been characterized in other tissues using the ligands 3H-nitrendipene and (+)3H-PN200-110. Saturation experiments were performed on homogenates obtained from five human prostate adenomas using these ligands. The binding of 3H-nitrendipine and (+)3H-PN200-110 in the prostate was saturable and of high affinity. The mean Kd of 3H-nitrendipine and (+)3H-PN200-110 was 0.92 +/- 0.11 nM and 0.14 +/- 0.02 nM, respectively. The mean Bmax of 3H-nitrendipine and (+)3H-PN200-110 was 0.57 +/- 0.06 and 0.19 +/- 0.02 fmol/mg. wet wt., respectively. The percent specific binding of 3H-nitrendipene and (+)3H-PN200-110 was 18 +/- 1% and 38 +/- 4%, respectively. The pharmacology of (+)3H-PN200-110 binding sites was further characterized using competition displacement experiments. The IC50 corrected values for Bay K 8644, nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem in the human prostate and other tissues are of the same order of magnitude. The prostate contains an abundance of high affinity DHP binding sites. The physiologic significance of the DHP binding sites in the prostate requires further investigation.\r"

Vaccination before a change in the measles vaccine stabilizer in 1979 (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 28.9) and vaccination before age 15 months (odds ratio, 13.9; 95% confidence interval, 5.9 to 32.6) were identified as risk factors. Revaccination strategies for all students ($3444 per case prevented), students vaccinated before 1980 ($3166 per case prevented), and students vaccinated before age 15 months ($2546 per case prevented) were evaluated, assuming use of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine after the initial case was detected in a school. However, a large proportion of cases (43% to 53%) may not have been preventable using these strategies. Therefore, revaccination in all schools assessed to be at risk for measles may be necessary to prevent large outbreaks until a two-dose vaccination schedule is fully implemented.\r"

Measured serum concentrations of terfenadine and its main metabolite showed excessive levels of parent terfenadine and proportionately reduced concentrations of metabolite, suggesting inhibition of terfenadine metabolism. We believe that a drug interaction between terfenadine and ketoconazole resulted in the elevated terfenadine levels in plasma and in the cardiotoxicity previously seen only in cases of terfenadine overdose.\r"

Fifteen patients who had been established on IVN were allocated at random to receive either BSHGH (0.1 mg/kg/day) or placebo daily for 7 days. All patients received the same feeding regimen which contaminated 14 gN, 1000 kcal of glucose and 1000 kcal of fat (Intralipid) daily. The mean nitrogen balance for days 4 to 7 was significantly more positive with BSHGH (7.0 +/- 0.6 gN/day) than with placebo (4.4 +/- 0.7 gN/day). The BSHGH group were lighter (53 +/- 4.6 kg body weight) than controls (68 +/- 5.1 kg), but the difference was not significant. Resting energy expenditure (expressed as percentage of day 1) increased throughout the study in patients receiving BSHGH (day 7, 120.8 +/- 5.5%), whereas in patients receiving placebo it remained stable (day 7, 98.9 +/- 2.7%). The nonprotein respiratory quotients were similar for BSHGH (mean days 4-7, 0.94 +/- 0.04) and placebo (mean days 4-7, 0.93 +/- 0.01) (p greater than 0.05). This study demonstrates more positive nitrogen balance, which may in part be due to different substrate loads, and an increase in energy expenditure in patients receiving BSHGH.\r"

Ileal mucosal protein content decreased by 63% (p less than 0.01) in the oral TPN-fed mice, although they gained weight on this diet. These TPN-fed mice also exhibited changes in mucosal structure and the normal ecology of their cecal microflora was disrupted leading to overgrowth with Gram-negative enteric bacilli. These changes in intestinal mucosal mass, morphology, and gut bacterial ecology were associated with an increased incidence of bacterial translocation (BT) (TPN group 70% BT vs control group 15% BT: p less than 0.01). The administration of cellulose fiber or kaolin (bulk-forming agents), but not of citrus-pectin (a fully-fermentable, nonresidue fiber) reduced the incidence of BT in the TPN-fed mice to control levels. The beneficial effects of these bulk-forming agents appeared to be due to their ability to prevent TPN-induced disruption of the intestinal microflora and alterations in intestinal morphology, even though they did not prevent ileal mucosal protein levels from decreasing. These results suggest that the administration of bulk forming agents will prevent the loss of intestinal barrier function against luminal bacteria that occurs in mice fed an oral TPN solution.\r"

Observed plasma lipid indices, carnitine and nitrogen balances, and plasma carnitine concentrations were not different in the prestudy period. Under standardized, steady-state conditions, 0.5 g/kg Intralipid was administered intravenously over 2 hr prior to carnitine administration, after infants received 7 days of 50 mumol/kg/day, and after a second 7 days of 100 mumol/kg/day of continuous intravenous L-carnitine as part of parenteral nutrition. Triglyceride (TGY), free fatty acid (FFA), acetoacetate (AA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOB), and plasma carnitine concentrations were measured prior to and at 2, 4, and 6 hr after the initiation of the lipid bolus. Twenty-four-hour urine collections for nitrogen and carnitine balance were obtained on days 7 and 14. Neonates receiving carnitine had significantly greater concentrations of plasma carnitine on days 7 and 14 (p less than 0.001). Greater nitrogen (p less than 0.05) and carnitine (p less than 0.001) balances and weight gain (week 2, p less than 0.05) were found in the carnitine-supplemented group when compared with controls. On day 14, (BOB + AA)/FFA ratios were significantly higher (p less than 0.05), and peak TGY concentrations and 6-hr FFA concentrations were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in the treatment group. Carnitine supplementation was associated with modest increases in growth and nitrogen accretion possibly by enhancing the neonate's ability to utilize exogenous fat for energy.\r"

A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted to determine the effect of prolonged total parenteral nutrition on body composition in 12 AIDS patients. Five patients were malnourished because of problems with food intake or absorption, while seven had systemic infections, with or without a malabsorption syndrome. The AIDS patients gained body weight and body fat content in response to total parenteral nutrition, while mean body cell mass, estimated as total body potassium content, was unchanged. However, all five patients with altered intake or absorption had significant repletion of body cell mass which was significantly different from the patients with systemic infections. Calorie and nitrogen intake did not differ between the two groups. It is concluded that body mass repletion is possible in AIDS patients in whom malabsorption is the major pathogenetic factor in producing malnutrition and is less successful in patients with serious ongoing systemic diseases. Thus, the response to nutritional support is dependent on the particular clinical circumstances.\r"

  ".W": "Since the addition of lipid to intravenous feeding formulas, animal and human studies have shown impairment of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) due to slow rates of clearance and gradual accumulation of long chain triglycerides (LCT) in the liver. Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) accumulate only minimally in the liver and do not impair the RES. However, results from animal studies using technetium sulfur colloid (TSC) to assess RES function have been inconclusive. The present study reevaluates RES function after lipid infusion in guinea pigs as measured by organ distribution of TSC. Guinea pigs were fed 300 kcal/kg/day of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 2.5 days, with 50% of nonprotein calories as fat in the form of LCT or MCT, then injected intravenously with 2.5 or 25 microCi of TSC, and uptake by liver, spleen, and lungs was determined. Liver, lungs, and spleen all increased in size after TPN with LCT or MCT. Liver TSC uptake was significantly affected by the dose of TSC (p less than 0.05), with the high dose probably inducing an increased capacity of the liver to clear TSC from the blood. Liver uptake was not influenced by diet, but feeding MCT did significantly stimulate lung uptake of TSC (p less than 0.0001). This suggests that the hepatic TSC uptake system is not saturable, and may not be an appropriate measure of Kupffer cell function since the colloid is not phagocytosed. However, TSC blood clearance remains an excellent prognostic indicator for bacteremia and mortality in humans, and is useful for measuring global RES function.\r"

The present studies evaluated eight patients who received the same total lipid dose of LCT infused continuously as in a three-in-one admixture, and another nine patients receiving the same amount of fat as a medium chain triglyceride (MCT)/LCT (75%/25%) emulsion intermittently over 10 hr at 0.13 g kg-1hr-1 for three consecutive days. Patients were given continuous total parenteral nutrition (TPN) comprised of protein, 1.5 g kg-1day-1, and dextrose, 4.5 g kg-1day-1. RES function was examined by measuring the clearance rates of intravenously injected TSC while receiving TPN containing only protein and dextrose, and again after three days of fat infusion. Mean (+/- SEM) clearance rate constants before and after continuous LCT infusion were 0.38 +/- 0.09 and 0.41 +/- 0.08 min-1, respectively, while those before and after intermittent MCT/LCT infusion were 0.50 +/- 0.18 and 0.73 +/- 0.24 min-1, respectively. In contrast to intermittent LCT infusion, the administration of continuous LCT or an intermittent MCT/LCT mixture does not impair TSC clearance by the RES. These findings suggest that condensing the daily period of LCT infusion at standard dosage may exceed the rate of metabolic utilization, resulting in increased fat removal and diminished TSC uptake by the RES.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with SVCO had been on HPN a mean of 51.5 months and had used 6.2 (range 1-50) central catheters, including short- and long-term, before SVCO was diagnosed. The frequency of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with SVCO was approximately the same as that in our general HPN population. Positive blood cultures were present immediately preceding the diagnosis of SVCO in 40% (six of 15) of cases. Atypical line placements were noted in two cases. The most common management strategies employed were conversion to enteral feedings in five patients and placement of a new catheter directly into the right atrium by thoracotomy in another five patients. Two of the five with right atrial catheters experienced a postpericardiotomy syndrome (fever, pericardial rub, and pulmonary infiltrates) that responded promptly to indomethacin. The most significant long-term sequela of SVCO was the need for a left jugular vein to right atrial appendage bypass in one patient with chronic venous congestion from her SVCO. Once the SVCO is confirmed, systemic heparinization provides immediate antithrombotic effect and minimizes the risk of pulmonary embolism. The use of streptokinase may result in rapid thrombolysis.\r"

Intravenous sites were changed an average of 1.1 times per patient during the course of therapy and only one serious complication was noted in 20 patients. Patients were followed through delivery and this information is presented. Total peripheral parenteral nutrition appears to be an acceptable alternative to conventional total parenteral nutrition to pregnant patients needing nutritional support.

Protein deficiency caused inter alia a decrease in body weight; a decrease in RNA/DNA ratio and an increase in the specific RNA labeling in liver and kidney; an altered nucleotide profile in the liver; an increase in the nucleotide/DNA and RNA/DNA ratios and a decrease in the specific labeling of the acid soluble fraction, RNA, and DNA in the bone marrow. These changes were prevented to the same extent by giving essential amino acids, either orally or intravenously. The minor changes in intestinal nucleotide profile in protein deprivation were prevented to a slightly larger extent by amino acids orally than parenterally. 5-Fluorouracil treatment gave a decrease in the RNA/DNA ratio in the liver and kidney but an increase in the nucleotide/DNA and RNA/DNA ratios in the bone marrow.

A jugular venous catheter was placed, and patency was maintained with a continuous infusion of normal saline at 3 ml/hr. After a 10-day recovery period, eight normal saline control rats were sacrificed and the remaining eight rats were given a parenteral nutrition solution (PN-50) at 3 ml/hr, providing 50% of the rat's daily energy requirement as 5% dextrose and 2% Intralipid. On day 14, study rats were further divided into two subgroups. Subgroup A received tryptophan (180 mg/day) added to the solution for 5 days. Subgroup B received the serotonin-receptor blocker, cyproheptadine 24 mg/kg/day, continuously for 5 days, and on day 16, tryptophan (0.25% = 180 mg/kg/day) was added to the solution for 3 days. Chow and water was continuously available and spontaneous food intake was measured daily. Study rats were sacrificed on day 19. Plasma amino acids and insulin and whole brain biogenic amines were compared with those in control rats using Student's t-test. With administration of PN-50, spontaneous food intake decreased to about 60% compared with the pre-PN level. The addition of tryptophan to the continuous infusion of PN-50 did not decrease spontaneous food intake further.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91039818\r", 
  ".W": "Several studies have reported that gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance symptoms are the limiting factor to enteral alimentation in the immediate postoperative period and often the reason for resorting to total parenteral nutrition (TPN). We postulated that Reabilan HN (a recently developed small peptide-based formula, in part obtained by enzyme hydrolysis of proteins) might be better absorbed and better tolerated so as to avoid the need for TPN. Accordingly, 19 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to receive Reabilan HN via jejunostomy or an equicaloric isonitrogenous TPN regimen. Both were begun 6 hr postoperatively at 25 ml/hr and increased by 25 ml/hr at 12-hr intervals up to the rate providing 1.5 times the calculated REE. GI tolerance to enteral feeding was excellent during the first three postoperative days, allowing the progression of the feeding rate to 99% of goal. During the next 3 days (starting on average 1.7 days after the return of bowel sounds), GI intolerance symptoms required a reduction in feeding rate to 52% on average. Subsequently, the symptoms resolved and the feeding rate reached 96% of goal. Although overall mean daily calorie and nitrogen intakes were lower for the enteral than for the TPN group (79.6 +/- 10.2% vs 94.6 +/- 3.8% of goal; p less than 0.01), the enteral group was nevertheless in positive caloric and nitrogen balance, and maintained similar serum albumin, prealbumin, and plasma transferrin levels. Average daily cost of supplies was $44.36 for enteral vs $102.10 for parenteral nutrition (p less than 0.001). We conclude that enteral feeding using this formula is well tolerated and cost-effective in the immediate postoperative period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have conducted a double-blind randomized crossover study to evaluate the effects of two enteral formulae (Enrich, 12.8 g of dietary fiber per 1000 kcal and Ensure, fiber-free) on stool frequency, fecal weight, laxative use, gastrointestinal tolerance and bowel function in chronic care tube-fed patients. Twenty-eight subjects (24 male, 4 female) completed the study. Mean daily number of stools and mean daily fecal wet weight in Enrich-fed patients were not significantly different from those of patients receiving Ensure. Ensure-fed patients required significantly more laxatives (p = 0.02) than those receiving Enrich. There were 26 reports of diarrhea in the Ensure-fed group as compared to 6 in the Enrich-fed group, and this difference was significant (p = 0.006). Reporting rates for constipation were not significantly different in the two groups. At the end of the study, the bowel function of 57.1% of patients receiving Enrich was improved when compared with that of 14.3% of Ensure-fed patients, and this difference was significant (p = 0.005). These results suggest that the addition of dietary fiber to enteral formulae improves gastrointestinal tolerance and bowel function, and reduces laxative use in long-term enterally fed patients.\r"

It is demonstrated in this study that loss of phenytoin to tubing is a function of pH. Nonionized phenytoin is irreversibly bound to NG tubing from solution at the pH of enteral nutrient solutions while this is not the case for anionic phenytoin in unbuffered water or saline. In experiments pulsing phenytoin through glass vs NG tubing perfused with buffer at varying pH, reversible loss to tubing was observed at high pH while irreversible loss was observed at low pH. In addition, the irreversible loss of phenytoin was greater in NG tubing than glass particularly at low pH. It is suggested that in those cases where tubing is placed into the duodenum, inadequate gastrointestinal residence time for dissolution of phenytoin solid and suspension dosage forms coupled with irreversible drug loss from solution to NG tubing will result in decreased phenytoin absorption and subsequently lower drug plasma levels.\r"

Each patient received gentamicin therapy via intravenous piggyback (IVPB) and in-line burette (ILB) methods. In the IVPB method, the drug was mixed in 5% dextrose in water (D5W) and infused intermittently. In the ILB method, the drug was mixed using the patient's total nutrient admixture (TNA) solution as the diluent in an ILB, which was inserted between the TNA bottle and its administration set and infused intermittently. A serial sampling of four sets of serum concentrations of the gentamicin was obtained. Pharmacokinetic parameters (Kel, Vd, and a maximum serum concentration) were calculated from the four sets of concentrations collected per patient. The IVPB method yielded mean values of Kel, Vd, and C1.5mg/kg of 0.13 hr-1, 0.39 liter/kg, and 5.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The ILB method yielded mean values of Kel, Vd, and C1.5mg/kg of 0.14 hr-1, 0.34 liter/kg, and 5.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. A t-test for paired samples was applied to these mean values. Significant difference was not found (p greater than 0.05). The intermittent infusion of gentamicin, using TNA as the diluent and an ILB, produced equivalent serum concentrations when compared with D5W as the diluent.\r"

We reviewed our data in an effort to determine relative efficacy and cost effectiveness of the two techniques. Thirty-five patients with PEGs were matched for age and diagnosis with 35 patients with GTs done by the same surgical service. PEGs were done in the endoscopy suite; GTs were done in the operating room: both under local anesthesia. Patients in PEG and GT groups were comparable in sex, diagnosis, and age. The PEG took less time to insert (15.3 vs 25.4 min, p less than 0.001). Major postoperative morbidity was similar with 10 systemic complications for each group and 11 deaths for the PEG vs 12 deaths for the GT group (at 90 days). Minor morbidity was higher for the PEG group with nine complications vs 1. Estimated cost for PEG was half the cost of GT. Hospital stay for the two groups was similar (36 vs 45 days, p greater than 0.1), but postop stay for the PEG group tended to be shorter (17 vs 24 days, p less than 0.08). The PEG is faster and cheaper to insert than the GT, however major morbidity and mortality are the same.\r"

Previously, it was difficult to maintain ketosis when parenteral (iv) nutrition therapy was necessary. The use of iv MCT in a 5-year-old girl with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who had diarrhea and dehydration is reported. Conventional 20% iv fat emulsion (long-chain triglycerides, LCT) and dextrose free hyperalimentation (HAL) in a 4:1 ketogenic ratio did not maintain adequate ketosis during bowel rest. Compassionate use of iv MCT (Clintec Nutrition) infused as a 70:30 MCT/LCT ratio plus HAL maintained moderate ketosis. Seizures were well controlled during the iv MCT regimen, which allowed normal daily functioning. Complications included abnormal liver function tests and severe iron deficiency anemia of unknown etiology. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels increased to 1717 mg/dl and 614 mg/dl, respectively, but decreased with a reduction of lipid infusion and use of an antihyperlipemic drug. Nutritional status was maintained. In this case, iv MCT proved to be a relatively safe and effective short-term method of continuing parenteral nutrition while maintaining ketosis for seizure control.\r"

  ".W": "It is now clear that atrophy of the intestinal mucosa can occur rapidly after injury and that the degree of atrophy is quantitatively related to the severity of injury. Such atrophy can be associated with translocation of bacteria and endotoxin, which can trigger the hypermetabolic response and induce a septic state, which may ultimately lead to multiple system organ failure. Early enteral feeding following trauma can prevent atrophy of the intestinal mucosa and is associated with a decrease in the hypermetabolic response and the incidence of septic complications and diarrhea. Enteral feeding of complete diets can also improve outcome with other forms of intestinal injury such as gamma irradiation or cytotoxic drugs. In contrast, total parenteral nutrition and elemental enteral diets are associated with atrophy of the intestinal mucosa and increased translocation. The addition of glutamine and/or fiber to elemental diets may decrease translocation in some but not all circumstances. It is now clear that enteral nutrition can influence the incidence and severity of translocation, which in turn can potentially reverse or prevent the adverse effects of injury and inflammation in traumatic injury and serious illness.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen reactive species are normally formed in cells and play an essential part of the bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells. The damaging effect of these oxygen reactive species is prevented by the endogenous scavengers SOD, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, circulating transferrin, ascorbic acid, and membrane-bound alpha-tocopherol. However, when excess amounts of oxygen radicals and hydrogen peroxide are formed, as in reperfusion injury or trauma, the endogenous scavengers are insufficient to react with these active molecules. Lipid peroxidation is an important part of the formation of oxygen reactive species. Lipid peroxidation, especially peroxidation of LDL, may have a significant role in atherosclerosis. Thus dietary manipulation of PG and TX formation through either feeding cold water fish oils or plant oils containing high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids may be a two-edged sword. Also, the dietary manipulation of arachidonic acid through increasing its precursor linoleate may cause a decrease in the immune response as seen in animal experiments. The marine oils may be regarded as a natural aspirin in that formation of PGs of the bisenoic series will be replaced by the PGs of the trienoic series. This results in the formation of TXA3, which is biologically inactive, and PGI3, which is biologically active like PGI2. This may have no physiologic consequences but it is used to illustrate a possible mechanism for the postulated beneficial cardiovascular effects of these oils. The issues and the mechanisms are controversial and frequently highly speculative. The subject is a boon for the lipid biochemist and nutritionist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Time and distance have allowed some of the controversy to die down, and as time has elapsed it has become clear that at least in the area of nutritional support of patients with hepatic failure, BCAA are the preferred alternative to treat patients who are otherwise protein intolerant. A recent unbiased review using the techniques of meta-analysis has concluded that the BCAA are efficacious for the treatment of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Since this manuscript was completed another study has been reported. In this study, it was notable that those patients treated with oral BCAA became neurologically normal, a finding which the authors found very striking.\r"

The present studies were designed to investigate the relationship between renal nerve integrity and renal proximal tubule (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity of basolateral membranes (BLMs) enriched from proximal tubules of five-week-old SHR was greater, 328.6 +/- 18.9 nmol Pi/mg protein.min, than in age-matched genetic controls rats (Wistar-Kyoto, WKY, rats), 262.3 +/- 34.6 nmol Pi/mg protein.min (P less than 0.02). There was no detectable difference in (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity of 13-week-old SHR and WKY rats. Prior renal denervation was associated with a reduction in proximal tubule basolateral membrane (BLM) (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity, 316.8 +/- 23.8 to 223.1 +/- 23.9 nmol Pi/mg protein/min (P less than 0.02), in five-week SHR. However, denervation had no effect on renal (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in either WKY rats, nor did sham-denervation in SHR. In addition, exogenous norepinephrine, 1 microM, produced a more pronounced stimulation of (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in basolateral membranes from SHR as opposed to WKY controls (40.2% vs. 28.7%). Therefore, renal nerve integrity and exogenous catecholamines have a greater stimulatory influence on proximal tubule (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in the early stages (prior to 5 weeks) of the development of hypertension in SHR than in age-matched WKY rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with AGN and NS had comparable edema (AGN 2.8 +/- 0.53 kg; NS 3.36 +/- 0.47 kg; SE) and urinary Na excretion (mean +/- SEM: AGN 0.97 +/- 0.11 mEq/hr; NS 1.06 +/- 0.16 mEq/hr), but AGN patients had five times higher ANF (AGN 27.2 +/- 4.06 fmol/ml; NS 5.51 +/- 1.02 fmol/ml; P less than 0.001) and six times lower PRA ng/liter.sec levels (AGN 0.187 +/- 0.047; NS 1.144 +/- 0.222; P less than 0.001) than NS patients. The degree of edema was correlated with ANF levels in AGN patients (P less than 0.001) but not in NS patients. There was a strong exponential negative correlation (r = -0.773, P less than 0.0001) between ANF and PRA, in which AGN patients and Na-restricted controls were located in the opposite ends of the volume sensing-response, and NS patients in the middle, alongside controls with regular Na intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Transport in this segment displays saturation kinetics, and exhibits a higher capacity for reabsorption in the earliest portion. Reclamation of bicarbonate is highly regulated in the proximal tubule: an increase in luminal [HCO3-], flow rate and arterial PCO2 increase, while alkalinization of the peritubular surface inhibits bicarbonate absorption. Angiotensin II also appears to regulate bicarbonate transport, especially in the S1 segment. The majority of the filtered bicarbonate load which escapes reabsorption in the proximal tubule is reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Bicarbonate reclamation in this segment is enhanced by luminal [HCO3-] and furosemide, and by chronic metabolic acidosis and increased dietary sodium intake. Amiloride, AVP and glucagon inhibit absorption in the thick ascending limb.\r"

A better prognosis was obtained by treatment with a combination of intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Immunohistochemical studies were performed by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. The positive rates in descending order were bombesin (80%), synaptophysin (74.3%), neurofilament (68.6%), neuron-specific enolase (60%), low molecular weight cytokeratin (54.3%), high molecular weight cytokeratin (25.7%), chromogranin-A (22.9%), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (0). Seven cases were examined and found to be ultrastructure; only 3 cases were found to contain neurosecretory granules. We emphasize that electron microscopy is not necessary as a routine diagnostic procedure, while light microscopy should be employed whenever possible; the immunohistochemical study should be considered within this context.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effectiveness of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with mitomycin C (MMC), 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil (tegafur), plus PSK, an immunomodulator, for patients with advanced gastric cancer who underwent histological curative resection. The effect of chemotherapy on prognostic serosal (ps) invasion [ps(-) or ps(+)] and lymph node metastasis [n(-) or N(+)] was examined. One hundred eighteen patients were in the no-chemotherapy group and 137 were on the drugs. The median follow-up time for the 86 survivors at the time of analysis was 13.8 years. With regard to prognostic factors, there were no differences between the two groups. Generalized Wilcoxon test of the two survival patterns revealed a P value of .0351, and the survival rate for 15 years was 45.7% for patients in the no-chemotherapy group and 56.9% for those of the chemotherapy group. In particular, adjuvant chemotherapy was effective for patients with ps(-)n(+) (P less than .05) and ps(+)n(-) (P less than .05), but not for those with ps(-)n(-) and ps(+)n(+). Our findings show that the concomitant prescription of MMC, tegafur, and PSK improves the 15-year survival rate for patients with advanced gastric cancer, following curative resection. As the survival rate is low for the patients with ps(+)n(+), an even more aggressive postoperative chemotherapy is recommended.\r"

All controls but not patient before thyroxine was started had a normal thyroid response to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), circulating concentrations of which were increased by administration of 500 micrograms thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). During treatment with thyroxine, 22 patients recovered thyroid responsiveness to TSH, and when treatment was stopped these patients have remained euthyroid for 1-8 years, whereas all 70 who did not recover thyroid TSH responsiveness became hypothyroid within 3 months. Over 20% of patients with hypothyroidism after Hashimoto's thyroiditis may recover satisfactory thyroid function, and can be identified during thyroxine treatment by their thyroid response to TSH in a TRH test.\r"

Samples of red cells from 12 D-positive subjects were sensitised in vitro with various amounts of antibody, the number of antibody molecules bound to the cells was estimated, and the cells were reinjected into the donor's circulation. Both antibodies mediated clearance but substantially fewer IgG3 than IgG1 antibody molecules were required to produce a given rate of clearance. The IgG3 antibody was slightly more effective than polyclonal anti-D, as judged by comparison with previously published results. Since there is believed to be an association between the rate of red cell clearance by anti-D and the ability of the antibody to suppress D immunisation, the IgG3 monoclonal antibody may prove suitable for the immunoprophylaxis of Rh D haemolytic disease.\r"

Compared with the children with uncomplicated malaria, mean plasma TNF levels were twice as high in cerebral malaria survivors and ten times as high in the fatal cases. Although high TNF levels were associated with high parasitaemia and with hypoglycaemia, they predicted fatal outcome in cerebral malaria independently of parasitaemia and glucose concentrations. Concentrations of interleukin-1 alpha, but not interferon gamma, were also related to the severity of malaria. We conclude that increased TNF production is a normal host response to P falciparum infection, but that excessive levels of production may predispose to cerebral malaria and a fatal outcome.\r"

Since the pattern of HBV infection in Africa is such that, compared with south-east Asia, infection occurs later in childhood and spread is horizontal rather than vertical, investigation of the method of spread of HBV may result in a means of control other than by vaccination. In the meantime, because of the overlap in the means by which HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are spread, it could be worthwhile taking advantage of existing AIDS prevention programmes to educate people about how to avoid both HBV and HIV infections.\r"

In an experimental circulation-occlusion model using flowing whole blood, human cadaveric arterial samples were irradiated by a sapphire probe with the Nd-YAG laser. The following experiments were performed: 1) lasing without perfusion, 2) lasing with saline perfusion of the probe, and 3) lasing with CO2 perfusion. Different perfusion flow rates of saline and CO2 were used. Results showed that the mean ablation area was 1.6-fold larger with CO2 than with saline perfusion (P less than 0.05, Student's t test). The mean lateral injury at the site adjacent to the ablation crater and at the area directly facing the probe was not significantly different with either perfusion medium. The larger ablation area with CO2 was probably due to the fact that CO2 is a good insulator for maintaining a higher probe temperature and keeps the probe free of blood debris. In conclusion, our results show that CO2 perfusion facilitates more effective laser ablation of atheromatous plaque than saline perfusion by the sapphire probe with the continuous wave Nd-YAG laser.\r"

  ".W": "A recently developed nonparametric regression technique, called a polynomial smoothing spline, is presented for detecting the ventilatory threshold (VT) and respiratory compensation (RC) points from gas exchange response data taken during an incremental exercise test. This type of curve fitting has the advantage of not requiring investigators to specify, a priori, the form of the underlying model, as is required with all linear regression techniques. This procedure yields a mathematically optimal fitted curve through the O2 uptake (VO2) vs CO2 output (VCO2) data and estimates of the process' first and second derivatives. A breakpoint or threshold is indicated by an increase in the value of the derivative and a peak in the second derivative. To evaluate this approach we analyzed gas exchange data collected on nine healthy subjects during a ramp exercise test (15 W.min-1) to the limits of tolerance. Utilizing this procedure we detected VT and RC breakpoints in four subjects and only VT breakpoints in the remaining five subjects. Our results and those obtained using the more conventional linear regression method were similar for those subjects whose RC points were detected using the smoothing spline procedure. However, using regression techniques for subjects with low or otherwise undetectable RC breakpoints, the linear regression method yielded less reliable results in our hands.\r"

Of the 9 patients studied, 8 were male, 8 were black, 6 were born in Haiti, 3 were homeless, 2 were intravenous drug users, and 1 was homosexual. At the time of diagnosis, 3 patients had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 5 patients had CD4 lymphocyte counts less than or equal to 170 cells/mm3, indicating marked immunodeficiency. All 9 patients presented with temperature greater than 38.3 degrees C, 5 (50%) had abnormal chest roentgenogram on admission, and each of the patients tested had elevations of at least 2 liver function tests. Eight patients (80%) had M. tuberculosis isolated from sputum or other body fluids and tissues. All blood isolates of M. tuberculosis were identified from Dupont Isolator tubes. Antibiotic-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis were cultured from 3 of the 6 patients born in Haiti. One patient died before diagnosis and received no antimycobacterial therapy; 7 of the remaining 8 patients appeared to respond to treatment. Our data, and a review of the literature, suggest that bacteremia due to M. tuberculosis is becoming more frequent, and that blood cultures may be helpful in establishing or confirming a diagnosis of tuberculosis in patients with HIV-1 infection.\r"

  ".W": "Despite provision of adequate calories and nitrogen, patients receiving current nutrition support formulations often have suppression of immune function. Certain nutrients may act pharmacologically on the immune system. The choice of nutrients appropriate for a given disease state must take into consideration the nutritional status of the subject, presence of infection, injury or hypermetabolism, and the specific immune defect. Nutritional therapy specific for certain disease states is complex and in its infancy but may hold promise for improved patient outcome. Randomized prospective trials to evaluate efficacy are mandatory. Continued research into individual nutrients to elucidate mechanisms of immunomodulation must follow. In the meantime, broad application of products shown to be effective for a specific indication is inappropriate.\r"

  ".W": "Seven patients with Parkinson's disease and three patients with progressive supranuclear palsy underwent adrenal medullary transplant to the caudate nucleus for treatment of their neurologic disease. Preoperative nutritional assessment demonstrated that a significant number of the Parkinson's patients had mild to moderate nutritional depletion. Motility problems, manifest by dysphagia and delayed gastric emptying causing problems over a number of years, were probably responsible. Of the 10 patients studied, 6 were studied by videofluoroscopy. All patients had variable dysphagia of variable servility with or without aspiration. Etiologic factors included the basic underlying neurologic disease, delay in resumption of anti-parkinsonian medications, use of metoclopramide, and postoperative medical complications leading to a debilitated clinical state.\r"

  ".W": "Enteral tube feedings have once again emerged as the first choice for nutritional support of the patient on the basis of safety, convenience, and economy. In order to provide adequate nutrition, an appropriate route of administration must be identified. Tube selection will depend on an accurate assessment of the patient, including the duration of therapy, history of abdominal procedures, competency of gag reflex, level of debilitation, gastrointestinal function, and discharge plan. Since placement of these tubes may involve several different physicians, a coordinator is necessary. The clinical specialist in nutrition support may be the appropriate health professional to coordinate this care. With an emphasis on shorter hospital stays, more patients may go home with enteral feeding regimens. The clinical specialist will need to be aware of these changes and become more involved in the initial enteral access device decision to insure appropriate selection.\r"
