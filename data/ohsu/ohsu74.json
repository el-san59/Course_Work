  ".W": "The nocturnal pattern of plasma prolactin (PRL) and cortisol in male epileptics with complex partial seizures and primary generalized seizures was studied by all-night polygraphic recordings with continuous video monitoring and sequential blood sampling at 30-minute intervals. Mean nocturnal plasma PRL concentrations in both groups of epileptics were significantly elevated when compared with nonepileptic control subjects studied in a similar fashion. Eight subclinical and three clinical partial seizures were recorded during sleep. Although a tenfold increase of plasma PRL level occurred following a short brief clinical complex partial seizure, there was no direct correlation between single subclinical partial seizures and nocturnal fluctuations of plasma PRL concentrations. We did not observe recognizable plasma cortisol changes following partial seizures during sleep, nor significant differences of mean nocturnal plasma cortisol levels between epileptics and controls. The data obtained in this environmentally controlled study indicate that postictal elevation of plasma PRL is a specific phenomenon related to seizure discharges; however, failure of such a rise does not exclude partial seizures.\r"

Angiographic findings in this disorder include disproportionate involvement of the distal common carotid artery and unusually long carotid lesions. Pathologic findings include destruction of the internal elastic lamina and replacement of the normal intima and media with fibrous tissue.

Our results replicated those of Storandt and coworkers in that these tests did distinguish normal persons from patients with both SDAT and other dementias.

These results indicate that assessment batteries utilizing additional procedures to supplement cognitive testing are indicated to more accurately discriminate among the dementias.\r"

Eighty percent of the patients had evidence of PVH, which increased significantly in patients older than age 50 years. In addition to age, history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and extracranial malignancy showed a significant association with PVH. A linear correlation was observed between the severity of PVH and an abnormal neurologic examination. In this retrospective, uncontrolled study, we concluded that PVH incidence among white men is high and increases with age or the presence of cardiovascular disease or extracranial malignancy. The degree of PVH positively correlates with abnormal neurologic evaluation and additional abnormalities seen on magnetic resonance imaging. However, the disease-related specificity is as yet undetermined.\r"

Significant impairment in any three areas, compatible with diagnosis of a dementia syndrome, was observed in 28% of these patients, and lesser or no cognitive impairment characterized the remaining patients. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the number and distribution of lesions as well as the presence of cerebral atrophy and atrophy of specific anatomic structures such as the corpus callosum. Results suggest that neither the number of lesions, the distribution of lesions, nor the extent of generalized cerebral atrophy was significantly greater in demented compared with non-demented patients. The primary finding was that atrophy of the corpus callosum was significantly more extensive on MRI scans in demented patients. Although the callosum itself may not be implicated directly in the pathogenesis of dementia, the presence of callosal atrophy on MRI scans should alert the physician to the possible occurrence of dementia in patients with multiple sclerosis.\r"

Six patients had a patent foramen ovale demonstrated by cardiac catheterization or surgery. Three patients had a newly discovered atrial septal defect, and one had an atrial septal defect that had previously been treated surgically. Results of the cardiac physical examination, chest roentgenography, and electrocardiography were unremarkable in 12 patients. Eighteen patients had a right-to-left shunt demonstrated by contrast echocardiography. Nine of these patients underwent cardiac catheterization; seven had abnormal catheterization study results: four had a patent foramen ovale and three had an atrial septal defect. Sixteen patients received medical therapy only while four underwent surgery. All patients survived the initial insult. There were no deaths or ischemic recurrences on follow-up ranging from one month to three years. We believe that contrast echocardiography can provide important diagnostic information, even in situations in which cardiac involvement is not suspected. Additional studies are needed before the optimal treatment of presumptive paradoxical cerebral embolism can be determined.\r"

Total IgM production by unstimulated cultured mononuclear cells, pokeweed mitogen-induced antibody synthesis, and plasma levels of IgM-RF were also lower in MTX-treated patients than in other RA patients. The numbers of circulating B cells, T4 and T8 cells, the T4:T8 cell ratio, and mitogen-induced proliferation indices were similar in MTX-treated and non-MTX-treated patients. Eleven additional patients were studied prospectively after initiation of MTX therapy. All showed significant decreases in spontaneous IgM-RF synthesis, with declining IgM-RF:IgM ratios, including all of the 9 who were studied during the first 24 hours of treatment. The results indicate that MTX has rapid effects on IgM-RF synthesis, and this action might be associated with its therapeutic efficacy in RA.\r"

  ".U": "87241748\r", 
  ".W": "19S IgM rheumatoid factors (RF) are polyclonal autoantibodies that may play an important pathogenic role in sustaining inflammatory synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RF in RA have reactivity for as-yet-uncharacterized antigenic determinants in IgG Fc. We hypothesized that qualitative differences might exist between some of these RF molecules, and that differences such as reactivity and affinity might characterize more pathogenic RF molecules. Previous observations in our laboratory indicate that RF produced by rheumatoid synovial cells (RSC) have greater reactivity with human IgG and IgG3 subclass, in contrast to serum RF, which has greater reactivity with rabbit IgG and human IgG1. These observations were made using a complement-dependent RF plaque-forming cell assay. The purpose of this study was to validate and extend those observations. Therefore, we examined the reactivity of RSC and serum RF with human and rabbit IgG and the reactivity and avidity of RSC-RF for IgG1 and IgG3 molecules and Fab, F(ab')2, and pFc' fragments thereof in a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay. In particular, we found: RSC-RF had at least twice as much reactivity with human IgG as with rabbit IgG; serum RF had approximately equal reactivity with human and rabbit IgG; RSC-RF had greater reactivity and avidity for IgG3 and IgG3 pFc' than for IgG1; and RSC-RF was nonreactive with Fab or F(ab')2 from either IgG1 or IgG3. These results suggest that the major antigenic determinant for RSC-RF resides in the CH3 domain of the IgG3 molecule. Precise characterization of this epitope may provide further insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of RA.\r"

Rheumatoid arthritis monocytes had more cell-associated IgG (P less than 0.001) and bound more 125I-labeled heat-aggregated IgG in vitro (P less than 0.02) than did monocytes from control subjects. Interaction of rheumatoid factor (RF) with monocytes was then investigated. Purified 125I-labeled IgM-RF and IgG-RF bound directly to monocytes from normal individuals. Furthermore, preincubation of normal monocytes with RF augmented subsequent binding of aggregated IgG to the cells. We conclude that monocyte-associated RF can enhance binding of IgG-containing immune complexes to the cells and can exaggerate the measured number of Fc receptors. Such cell-bound RF may affect clearance of immune complexes by the reticuloendothelial system in vivo.\r"

The paper also describes the risk factors for work loss among patients with RA. It uses data from a panel of 698 RA patients, observed for 4 years, from the practices of a random sample of northern California rheumatologists. Of these 698, 353 had worked for pay at some point in their lives. Three hundred six of the 353 had worked when diagnosed as having RA. Of these 306, 157 (51%) were no longer working in 1985. Forty-seven individuals started working after the onset of illness, but of these, approximately one-third had stopped working by 1985. In all, 50% of RA patients with some work experience stopped working within a decade of diagnosis, 60% within 15 years, and 90% within 30 years. We found that the probability of work loss is lessened among persons in jobs that have few physical requirements, among those with high levels of discretion over the pace and activities of work, and among those who were able to stay on the job held when the diagnosis was made. The probability of work loss is increased among service workers. The findings of this longitudinal study, showing that work characteristics profoundly alter the probability of work loss among persons with RA, are consistent with the findings of our earlier cross-sectional studies of work outcome and RA.\r"

We used agarose affinity electrophoresis with concanavalin A (Con A) as a ligand. Results were expressed as reactivity coefficients (RC), which are the ratios of variants reactive with Con A to the variants not reactive with Con A. No significant differences were found between the mean RC (+/- SD) in healthy individuals (1.35 +/- 0.26) and that in patients with various degrees of SLE activity. In contrast, a significantly higher mean RC was found in sera from patients with intercurrent infection (2.70 +/- 0.76) compared with each of the other groups studied (P less than 0.001). An RC greater than 2.25 was found in none of 42 sera from patients without infection and in 15 of 18 sera from patients with infection (sensitivity 83%, specificity 100%). C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in SLE patients with intercurrent infection than in patients with very active disease (P less than 0.05). Levels of CRP greater than 60 mg/liter were found in 3 of 42 SLE patients without infection and in 8 of 18 patients with infection (sensitivity 39%, specificity 93%). The results show that in SLE patients, the finding of a relative increase in Con A-bound serum alpha 1-acid glycoprotein is a more sensitive indicator of intercurrent infection than is the finding of increased levels of CRP.\r"

Bradykinin, at and above a 3-nM concentration, caused a dose-dependent stimulation of bone mineral mobilization and matrix degradation. Bradykinin-stimulated resorption was inhibited by calcitonin, an increased concentration of phosphate in the culture medium, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, indomethacin, meclofenamic acid, naproxen, and 5, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraenoic acid. The results suggest that bradykinin stimulates osteoclast-mediated bone resorption by a process that is dependent on endogenous prostaglandin production. The stimulatory effect of bradykinin, but not of parathyroid hormone and prostaglandin E2, was potentiated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, BPP5a. Treatment with carboxypeptidase B did not affect the capacity of the peptide to stimulate 45Ca release. DesArg9-bradykinin (1 mumole/liter) stimulated 45Ca release to the same degree as did bradykinin. Bradykinin (3 microM) did not affect the degradation of cartilage proteoglycans, as assessed by the release of 35S-sulfate from prelabeled calf articular cartilage in organ culture. These findings suggest that generation of bradykinin in inflammatory lesions of rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis may contribute to the bone resorptive process seen in the joints and alveolar bone; however, bradykinin does not directly activate chondrocytes into a catabolic state.\r"

While BALB/c mice developed minimal myositis when infected with a diabetogenic variant (EMC-D), the same strain inoculated with a newly isolated myopathic variant (EMC-221A) developed viral dose-dependent elevations in muscle-associated enzymes, bilateral limb muscle weakness, and the histopathologic changes of severe polymyositis.

  ".W": "Although ultraviolet (UV) light is generally harmful to patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, most clinical and immunologic studies of UV exposure have evaluated the effects of UV-B (280-320 nm). The long-wavelength UV-A band (320-400 nm), however, is less toxic than UV-B and has different immunologic actions. Therefore, we studied the effect of UV-A irradiation on survival and immunologic function in the (New Zealand black x New Zealand white)F1 hybrid mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus. Twenty-one (New Zealand black x New Zealand white)F1 mice were treated with 3.5 joules/cm2/day of UV-A light for 5 days each week, beginning at age 10 weeks. A control group consisted of 20 untreated animals. All UV-A-irradiated mice survived to 32 weeks, compared with 12 of 20 mice in the nonirradiated group (P = 0.0013). Splenomegaly was significantly decreased in the irradiated mice (P less than 0.03). Mice that received UV-A treatment combined with depilation had significantly improved lymphocyte responses to phytohemagglutinin and lipopolysaccharide and significantly decreased levels of anti-DNA antibodies compared with mice that received neither treatment. Reductions in spleen size and anti-DNA antibody titer were significantly correlated with improved parameters of lymphocyte function. These results suggest that a relatively small dose of UV-A exerts significant therapeutic action in murine lupus, perhaps through an effect on immunologic regulation.\r"

Leydig cells were incubated for two hours in sealed plastic vials with various concentrations of ethanol (0.3-40 mM) or acetaldehyde (5-40 microM). Very low ethanol concentrations (2.5 mM) reduced testosterone production significantly, whereas even 40 microM acetaldehyde added repeatedly to the incubation medium had no effect on testosterone levels. An inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, 4-methylpyrazole, abolished the ethanol-induced inhibition of testosterone synthesis. A suggested mechanism for the inhibition is an elevated free [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio in Leydig cells caused by the metabolism of ethanol.\r"

It is concluded that mild hyperglycaemia and glucose intolerance can occur in regular heavy drinkers who are otherwise clinically normal.

The metabolism of ethanol by all four types of murine tissue macrophage was only slightly suppressed by pyrazole, 4-iodopyrazole and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, which are known to inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), pi ADH and catalase respectively. By contrast, ethanol metabolism by these cells was strongly suppressed by three inhibitors of the cytochrome P-450-dependent microsomal ethanol-oxidising system--namely, carbon monoxide, metyrapone and tetrahydrofurane.\r"

It has been shown that chronic ethanol intake decreases the enterocyte turnover and enhances galactose absorption. Whether it affects iron absorption is still controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chronic ethanol ingestion on whole body iron absorption in rats. Twenty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were pair-fed a liquid diet containing either ethanol as 36% of total calories or an isocaloric diet where fat was substituted for ethanol. On the 28th day, four-hour fasted rats were given an oral dose of 59Fe (0.5 microCi) and were immediately counted by a whole body counter. 59Fe levels were then monitored over the following nine days. Although ethanol- and control-fed rats had a similar hepatic iron content (59.5 +/- 5.8 vs 60.2 +/- 7.4 micrograms/100 mg dry liver weight) (mean +/- S.E.M.), the 59Fe total body content was greater in the ethanol group (75% +/- 3%) compared with the control group (45% +/- 4%). These results show that chronic ethanol ingestion increased iron absorption in rats. A reduction of enterocyte turnover may play a role in determining this effect.\r"

Turnover was decreased in the corpus striatum after ethanol treatment due to a decrease in 5-hydroxyindol-3-ylacetic acid (5-HIAA), and an increase in 5-HT, concentration. Noradrenaline concentration was also increased in this region, but those of dopamine and GABA were similar to control values. Ethanol had no effect on any of the neurotransmitters studied in the brain stem and hippocampus, nor on the activity of monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A) and 5-HT uptake in the three brain regions. Chronic ethanol administration caused a selective decrease in striatal 5-HT turnover which was unrelated to either its rate of inactivation, or the activity of other brain neurotransmitters. These findings are discussed in relation to those obtained in previous studies.\r"

Ventilation volumes and airway pressures were not correlated with hand size or device type. Techniques that used one hand to squeeze the bag resulted in significantly lower average tidal volume than two-handed techniques, with no significant difference in peak or average airway pressure. There was no difference between emergency department and prehospital personnel in average tidal volume delivered. However, prehospital personnel ventilated at significantly higher airway pressures. Emergency department nurses delivered the greatest average tidal volume (923 cc), while emergency department physicians delivered the least (775 cc). Paramedics recorded the highest airway pressures (average, 53 cm H2O; peak, 72 cm H2O), while respiratory therapists recorded the lowest pressures (average, 34 cm H2O; peak, 54 cm H2O). Ventilation during CPR is a complex, learned skill. Large variation exists among different operators. However, appropriate tidal volumes can be delivered using safe airway pressures. Ongoing assessment and retraining of individuals performing ventilation during CPR are essential.\r"

  ".W": "Elevated cerebral lactate levels following cerebral ischemia have been associated with brain cell damage and death. We previously found that pre- or postischemia treatment with dichloroacetate (DCA), presumably by its activation of brain pyruvate dehydrogenase, effectively lowers cerebral lactate levels in rats subjected to 30 minutes of partial global ischemia (PGI) followed by 30 minutes of recirculation. The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of preischemia DCA treatment on cortical lactate levels during the ischemia period or during early recirculation. Rats (four in each group) received preischemia treatment with DCA and were then subjected to 0, 10, or 30 minutes of PGI or 30 minutes of PGI followed by 15 minutes of recirculation. Cortical lactate levels in pretreated animals were not significantly different from lactate levels of untreated rats at any time during PGI, but were significantly lower than levels in untreated rats at 15 minutes of recirculation (P less than .05, ANOVA). These results suggest that preischemia treatment with DCA does not limit the accumulation of cortical lactate during PGI but may promote its clearance during recirculation following PGI. If reperfusion events influence the degree of brain cell injury, DCA may enhance cell recovery by lower cortical lactate levels in the reperfusion period.\r"

RAPS is an abbreviated version of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE-II) using only parameters routinely available on all transported patients (i.e. pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale). RAPS has a range from 0 (normal) to 16. Two hundred eighty-three patients were transported by helicopter; 62 died. Pretransport RAPS was available on 282 of 283 patients (mean, 3.85; median, 3). Because of death, discharge, or transfer, 227 complete APACHE-II scores using least physiologic values for the first 24 hours after transfer were collected (mean, 14.98; median, 13). Stepwise logistic regression showed that when all APACHE-II and RAPS values were available, the best single predictor of mortality was worst value APACHE-II (X2(1) = 57.09, P less than .01). When pretransport RAPS was considered as a single explanatory variable, it too had significant predictive power for mortality (X2(1) = 92.53, P less than .01). Correlation analysis comparing RAPS with APACHE-II values at similar points in time revealed a significant relationship in all cases, with the highest correlation between RAPS worst values and APACHE-II worst values (r = .8472, P less than .01). It was concluded that RAPS can be applied usefully in complement with APACHE-II and may have limited utility when used alone.\r"

During an eight-year period, the author observed this complication in 20 children. The mechanism of this edema is complex and not yet fully understood. In addition to hypoxia, profound hemodynamic changes occur during the inspiratory phase of the obstruction; highly negative transpulmonary pressure may lead to an increase in pulmonary blood volume and biventricular dysfunction, and possibly disruption of integrity of the pulmonary endothelium. These hemodynamic changes appear to be counterbalanced by the positive pleural and alveolar pressures and decreased venous return during the expiratory component of the obstruction. Nevertheless, when an artificial airway is inserted, this compensation is disrupted abruptly, resulting in an increase in systemic venous return and thus pulmonary edema. Although this type of edema usually is observed in cases of severe obstruction, it may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed.\r"

Forty-seven consecutive patients who presented to the emergency department with subungual hematoma involving more than one fourth of the nail bed were included in this study. In these cases, radiographs were taken, and the nail was lifted to look for a laceration. In the subgroup of patients who had subungual hematoma associated with a fracture, all of them had a laceration requiring repair. Patients with a subungual hematoma greater than one half of the size of the nail bed had a 60% incidence of a laceration requiring repair. The authors believe that patients presenting with a subungual hematoma involving greater than one half of the nail surface and a fracture of the distal phalanx should have the nail lifted and the nail bed explored and repaired.\r"

Hydrogen cyanide gas, the most toxic product of combustion, seldom is recognized as a significant hazard in smoke inhalation. During the first four months of 1986, toxic amounts of cyanide were found in four of the six fatalities from house fires in Akron, Ohio. These cases illustrate the increasing frequency of cyanide poisoning in household fires. Sources of cyanide toxicity include the increased use of synthetic polymers in building materials and furnishings. Prompt recognition of and therapy for cyanide intoxication may reduce the morbidity and number of delayed deaths in fire victims. The key point in the diagnosis of cyanide poisoning is a high index of suspicion. The clinical presentation of cyanide intoxication, its diagnosis, and subsequent treatment are discussed. Finally, a prehospital protocol for treating smoke-inhalation victims who may have been exposed to cyanide gas is suggested.\r"

The frequency of significant stenoses in the left main coronary artery was greater in men than in women. The arteries that were least affected were the distal branches of the right coronary artery. A notable feature was the widespread nature of the coronary atherosclerosis: only 26 of the total of 1840 segments of coronary artery examined in the 92 victims could be described as having a normal intima (less than or equal to 10% loss of the area within the internal elastic lamina).\r"

Particular attention was paid to the following: the large and small coronary arteries, the nerves and ganglia, the conduction system, and the histological and cellular features of the cardiomyopathy. There were pleomorphic nuclei and focal fibrosis and degeneration throughout each heart including the conduction system. There were distinctive abnormalities of both large and small coronary arteries, and focal degeneration of nerves and ganglia. These observations suggest a mosaic concept for the pathogenesis for the cardiomyopathy of Friedreich's ataxia that involves the interplay of molecular faults, cardiomyopathy, cardioneuropathy, and coronary disease.\r"

The survival rates of patients operated on between the ages of four and 20 years are 97%, 97%, 92% at 10, 20, and 30 years after operation. For patients operated on after the age of 20 the corresponding rates are 93%, 85%, and 68%. This difference is statistically significant from the fifteenth year of follow up onwards. The survival of patients operated on before the age of 20 is not significantly different from that of a comparable general Italian population. Recoarctation occurred in only 8% of patients who had end to end anastomosis, whereas it occurred in 35% of those who had other types of operation. Two thirds of the patients were hypertensive at the last visit. The actuarial curve shows that blood pressure was normal in most patients 5-10 years after operation, but 30 years after coarctation repair only 32% of patients are expected to be normotensive. Thus early repair of aortic coarctation appears to improve long term survival. Intervention in older patients and when blood pressure is high seem to be the most important predictors of late hypertension.\r"

Data on alcohol consumption were obtained by interviewing the patients and their age and sex matched controls on admission. The mean daily alcohol intake of group 2 patients during the week preceding atrial fibrillation was significantly larger than that of either controls or group 1 patients. Compared with controls significantly more patients in both groups with atrial fibrillation had consumed alcohol within two days of the onset of the arrhythmia. Significantly more patients had onset of arrhythmia on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday than on any other weekday, including patients with high alcohol intake. This study establishes alcohol as an important precipitating factor for new onset atrial fibrillation.\r"

The frontal plane P wave axis was displaced leftwards and upwards in four out of seven cases in which an electrocardiogram was available. No case showed arrhythmia on a standard electrocardiogram preoperatively. Echocardiograms were available in four cases and in each case diagnosis of the anomalous connections of the systemic vein was possible. Only one third of the cases showed a crescentic shadow of the persistent left superior caval vein on chest x ray. A chest x ray and electrocardiogram do not provide the means of reliable diagnosis of this condition, though they may suggest the possibility of its existence.

Analysis of the drop-outs did not indicate that the presence of hand eczema was an important selection factor for response to the questionnaire. Those subjects considering themselves to have had hand eczema within the previous 12 months were invited to a dermatological examination to verify the diagnosis and for further investigation. Seventy-one per cent accepted the invitation. Analysis of drop-outs showed that willingness to attend the dermatological examination was to some extent dependent on the severity of the hand eczema. It was found that almost 11% considered themselves to have had hand eczema at some time during the previous 12-month period; approximately two thirds were women. Five point four per cent had had hand eczema at a particular point in time (prevalence) and 2% had had continuous problems with hand eczema during the previous year.\r"

Eleven point one per cent of 615 infants developed a haemangioma. Haemangiomas were more common in girls than boys, and in infants of lower gestational age. Hypothermia in the first hours of life and neonatal illness were associated with lower prevalence, suggesting that neonatal skin perfusion influences haemangioma development; this is consistent with a tendency for haemangiomas to be distributed centripetally. However, the major aetiological determinants are unknown. Children with a haemangioma were more likely to have had a febrile convulsion than those without a haemangioma.\r"

Histopathologically there were discrete foci of hyperkeratosis with some parakeratosis over an attenuated and partially spongiotic epidermis. A genetic influence in this disorder was suggested by its occurrence in sisters in two families and in a mother and daughter. Immunohistochemical and biochemical studies suggested that there is a disorder of keratinocyte proliferation in the disease.\r"

The ultimate efficacy index is expressed as the UVR dose under which a selected percentage of the population is safely protected by a sunscreen. This method takes into account several sources of bias in the current test procedure, in particular the considerable variability in individual responses. It also takes into account subjects in whom the MED of the protected skin is either higher or lower than the range of challenge doses to which they were exposed, thereby increasing the effective sample size. This method provides a more precise and comprehensive index of sunscreen protection, and enables statistical comparison of different preparations, or of the effect of other factors on their efficacy.\r"

Erythrocyte/human umbilical vein EC interactions were studied under controlled flow conditions for normal (AA), homozygous sickle cell (SS), sickle cell trait (AS), mechanically injured normal, and \"high-reticulocyte control\" RBC by using video microscopy and digital image processing. The number of adherent RBC was determined at ten-minute intervals during a washout period. Results indicate that SS RBC were more adherent than AA RBC. Mechanically injured (sheared) AA RBC were also more adherent than control normal cells but less adherent than SS RBC. AS RBC did not differ significantly in their adhesive properties from normal RBC. Less-dense RBC were more adherent to EC than dense cells for normal, SS, and high-reticulocyte control RBC. The number of cells adherent at a given time during washout was a very strong function of wall shear rate. In addition, at all shear rates studied, the average velocity of individual SS RBC in the region near the EC surface was approximately half that of AA RBC at the same bulk volumetric flow rate through the flow chamber. These findings suggest that the increased adhesion of sickle RBC is at least partially related to the increased numbers of less-dense RBC present. Increased adherence of the less-dense cells to the EC lining vessel walls could contribute to microvascular occlusion by lengthening vascular transit times of other sickle cells.\r"

Ghosts from spx thalassemia intermedia patients had a significant increase in their globin content (which was mostly heme reactive) and contained extra polypeptides in the protein 4.2 to 5 and 6-globin areas. The Triton-extracted MS from all of the thalassemic patients showed two major abnormalities: they retained up to twice the amount of protein 3 when compared with controls; they had a significant increase in their globin content, the concentration of which was independent of their protein 3 content. Analysis of the IOV revealed no differences between those prepared from normal controls and those of the patients. MS from spx thalassemia intermedia patients were grossly abnormal when examined by scanning electron microscopy and they exhibited aggregates of material that on transmission electron microscopy suggested the presence of globin precipitates. We propose that, although the integral protein composition, as reflected in the IOV, from severely affected beta-thalassemics is intact, their MS assembly is deranged. The altered skeletal structure of thalassemic RBC could result from attachment of denatured globin to the skeleton components. These abnormalities may contribute to the premature cell death seen in severe beta-thalassemia.\r"

This study was designed to determine the postnatal development of the human coagulation system in the healthy full-term infant. Consecutive mothers of healthy full-term infants born at St Joseph's Hospital in the city of Hamilton were approached for consent. One hundred eighteen full-term infants (37 to 42 weeks' gestational age) were entered into the study. Demographic information and a 2-mL blood sample were obtained in the postnatal period on days 1, 5, 30, 90, and 180. Between 40 and 79 full-term infants were studied on each day for each of the coagulation tests. Plasma was fractionated and stored at -70 degrees C for batch assaying of the following tests: prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin clotting time, and factor assays (biologic): fibrinogen, II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and high-molecular weight kininogen. Factor XIII subunits A and S, von Willebrand factor, and the inhibitors antithrombin III, alpha 2-antiplasmin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, C1 esterase inhibitor, protein C, and protein S were measured immunologically. Plasminogen, prekallikrein, and heparin cofactor II were measured by using chromogenic substrates. The large number of infants studied at each time point allowed us to determine the following: the range of normal for each test at five time points in the postnatal period; that coagulation tests vary with the postnatal age of the infant; that different coagulation factors show different postnatal patterns of maturation; and that near-adult values are achieved for most components by 6 months of life. In summary, this large cohort of infants studied consecutively in the postnatal period allowed us to determine the normal development of the human coagulation system in the full-term infant.\r"

Bone marrow megakaryocyte ploidy distribution was determined by using unfractionated bone marrow, a polyclonal megakaryocyte-specific probe, and two-color, fluorescence-activated flow cytometry. With these techniques, the modal megakaryocyte ploidy class in normal murine bone marrow was 16N. Serial studies of bone marrow megakaryocyte ploidy after the induction of acute, severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count, less than 0.05 X 10(6) microL) demonstrated no detectable change in the ploidy distribution at 12, 24, and 36 hours after the onset of thrombocytopenia. At 48 hours, the modal ploidy class shifted from 16N to 32N, and the 64N class increased significantly (P less than .001). The ploidy distribution returned to normal 120 hours after the onset of thrombocytopenia. A lesser degree of thrombocytopenia (platelet count reduction to 0.100 to 0.200 X 10(6)/microL) delayed the modal ploidy class shift from 16N to 32N until 72 hours after the onset of thrombocytopenia. Chronic, severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count, less than 0.05 X 10(6)/microL for seven days) resulted in a modal ploidy class shift from 16N to 32N during the thrombocytopenic phase and an enhanced increase in the 64N megakaryocyte class during the recovery phase. Mean platelet volume (MPV) was simultaneously measured on isolated total platelet populations after induction of thrombocytopenia. MPV was significantly increased (P less than .001) as early as eight hours after the onset of acute, severe thrombocytopenia, 40 hours before a shift in the ploidy distribution. Mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count reduction to 0.400 X 10(6)/microL) was not associated with a ploidy shift but did result in a significantly increased MPV (P less than .001). These studies demonstrate that the temporal relationship and magnitude of the effects of thrombocytopenia upon megakaryocyte ploidy distribution are dependent upon the degree and the duration of the thrombocytopenic stimulus and that the effects of experimental thrombocytopenia on platelet volume and megakaryocyte ploidy are dissociated.\r"

Studies of red cells, hemolysates, purified hemoglobin solutions, and artificial mixtures of Hb A and Setif suggest that pseudosickling is produced by intracellular crystallization of insoluble hemoglobin. Increased tonicity of the suspending medium accentuates the process, probably by causing a rise in intracellular hemoglobin concentration. If precipitates from A/Setif mixtures are analyzed, they always contain Hb A, suggesting an unusual mechanism for the process. Despite the fact that osmolality in the renal medulla is similar to that which produces pseudosickling in vitro, carriers do not have renal dysfunction of the type found in patients with sickle cell disease.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies on platelet HLA indicate that greater than 50% of platelet HLA antigens are adsorbed on the platelet surface and may be derived from plasma. It has been speculated that platelet HLA may be directly proportional to plasma HLA concentration. To determine the quantitative correlation between plasma and platelet HLA, a precise competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for measurements of soluble and cellular HLA antigens was developed by using purified HLA antigens and W6/32 anti-HLA monoclonal antibody. The useful range of the standard curve for the assay was 0.01 to 5.0 micrograms/mL. The intraassay and interassay variations were 7% and 14%, respectively. The plasma HLA concentrations measured in 61 healthy adults ranged from 0.25 to 4.1 micrograms/mL, and the mean plasma HLA concentration was 1.47 +/- 0.87 micrograms/mL (+/- SD). Platelet HLA concentrations determined in the same 61 persons ranged from 4.7 to 17.33 fg/platelet, and the mean concentration was 9.3 +/- 2.9 fg/platelet (+/- SD). Chloroquine-elutable platelet HLA concentrations were also determined in 42 of the 61 persons, with the mean value of 5.7 +/- 2.1 fg/platelet (+/- SD). The plasma HLA concentration of each individual was then correlated with the same person's total or chloroquine-elutable platelet HLA concentration. Linear regression analyses of the results revealed no significant correlation between platelet and plasma HLA concentrations. Thus, it is unlikely that chloroquine-elutable HLAs are derived from plasma. The developed solid-phase assay for HLA will be useful for further study of the quantitative significance of plasma HLA antigens in allosensitization of transfused individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with beta zero thalassemia arising from premature terminator codon mutations in the gene for beta globin do not produce beta globin protein; these individuals also exhibit a decreased amount of beta globin mRNA in their erythroid cells. The absence of beta globin protein is readily explained by the inability of the beta zero-39 mRNA to be translated. The decrease in beta globin mRNA has been attributed to either decreased cytoplasmic stability of the nontranslatable decreased cytoplasmic stability of the nontranslatable mRNA or to an undefined nuclear lesion. To compare directly the relative stabilities of normal and beta zero-39 thalassemic globin transcripts, we prepared normal and thalassemic beta globin pre-mRNAs and mRNAs using cloned DNA templates and the SP6 promoter-polymerase system. The stability of the transcripts was assessed by incubation in various cell-free extracts. Our results indicate that although the stabilities of the beta globin transcripts varied considerably from one extract to another the stabilities of the beta zero-39 thalassemic pre-mRNAs and mRNAs were equal to those of normal beta globin mRNAs in every extract tested.\r"

In the experiments we report, the kinetics of renal Epo production in response to acute hypoxia and the intrarenal localization of cellular Epo synthesis were studied at the level of Epo mRNA. Erythropoietin mRNA expression was determined by Northern blot analysis of rat kidney RNAs using a probe derived from the mouse Epo gene. Renal Epo mRNA content increased as early as 1 hour after initiation of hypoxia and continued to accumulate during 4 hours of stimulation. Discontinuation of the hypoxic stimulus resulted in rapid decay of mRNA levels. Kidney and plasma Epo levels measured by radioimmunoassay paralleled, with respective lag times, the changes in renal Epo mRNA content, suggesting that Epo production in response to acute hypoxia represents de novo synthesis and is regulated by changes in Epo mRNA. Northern blot analysis of RNAs extracted from separated glomerular and tubular tissue fractions revealed Epo mRNA in the tubular fraction, whereas glomerular tissue did not contain Epo mRNA. Thus, the site of cellular Epo synthesis is located in the renal tubule or its interstitium and not in the glomerular tuft.\r"

  ".W": "Red cell concentrates (RCC) are stored for 35 to 42 days in plastic containers manufactured with the liquid plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). DEHP leaches from the polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastic bag, then binds to and stabilizes the RC membrane. This study was undertaken to determine the deformability of the RC membrane using an osmotic gradient ektacytometer and to relate these measurements to the concentration of DEHP in the stored RCC. Pooled RCC was aliquoted into PL146 (PVC), PL732 (polyolefin), and PL732 (with added DEHP) bags with samples removed weekly for analysis of osmotic fragility, deformability, and DEHP concentration. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content was also measured. The increase in osmotic fragility during storage was greater when RCC was stored without DEHP. In addition, there was a decrease in the maximum elongation index (El max) when there was decreased DEHP in the storage bag. The osmolarity (Omax) at which El max occurred, as well as the Omin, the osmolarity at which minimum elongation (El min) occurred was higher in the PL732 container than in the PL146 or in the PL732 to which DEHP had been added. These changes could be reversed by addition of DEHP at the beginning of the storage period, showing a direct correlation between DEHP concentration during storage and RC membrane flexibility. By a better understanding of the mechanism of DEHP protection, it might be possible to substitute a less toxic stabilizing compound.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained using reticulocytes from phenylhydrazine-treated rats and iron-deficient rats. Each step in the iron uptake mechanism was investigated, ie, transferrin-receptor interaction, transferrin endocytosis, iron release from transferrin, and transferrin exocytosis. Although there were quantitative differences, no fundamental difference was found in any of the abovementioned aspects of cellular function when the reticulocytes from Belgrade rats were compared with those from iron-deficient animals. The basic defect in the Belgrade reticulocytes must therefore reside in subsequent steps in iron uptake, after it is released from transferrin within endocytotic vesicles, ie, in the mechanism by which it is transferred across the lining membrane of the vesicles into the cell cytosol. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of reticulocyte ghosts extracts demonstrated a prominent protein band of mol wt 69,000 that was absent or present only in low concentration extracts from the other two types of reticulocytes. This may be a result of the genetic defect.\r"

In this study, membrane protein changes occurring during phagocytosis were studied in human neutrophils using surface radiolabeling before or after phagocytosis of various target particles. Cells were labeled at the cell surface using lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination or neuraminidase-galactose oxidase-NaB3H4, galactose oxidase-NaB3H4, or periodate-NaB3H4 techniques. Such studies are complicated by the fact that these techniques identify many surface proteins on the phagocyte, and labeling after phagocytosis occurs often results in radiolabeling proteins of the target particle, thus making changes in cell-surface proteins more difficult to detect. Immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody AHN-1, which reacts with a carbohydrate present on several human neutrophil surface proteins and inhibits phagocytosis, eliminated interference caused by radiolabeled proteins of the target particle and simplified analysis by restricting the study to a limited number of proteins. AHN-1 immunoprecipitated less radiolabeled protein from neutrophils labeled after phagocytosis of particles opsonized with IgG or complement than from cells labeled before phagocytosis. Isolation of phagocytic vesicles containing opsonized emulsified paraffin oil demonstrated that three proteins of mol wt 105,000, 140,000, and 170,000 recognized by AHN-1 were internalized in the phagocytic vesicle during phagocytosis.\r"

The serum uric acid level showed an increase from the first to the third day post-operatively and returned to normal within a week, but in patients undergoing other urological operations there was no post-operative increase.

In this preliminary study, a variety of anti-BGA reagents, with known specificities that involve the carbohydrate backbone in addition to the BGA specific terminal monosaccharides, were used to study the expression of the A and H (O) BGA in cryostat sections of 16 patients with benign prostatic disease and nine with prostatic cancer. Positive staining, appropriate to the patients' blood group, was seen in all of the benign tissues when anti-BGA reagents that included specificity against type 2 backbone structures were used. Staining was absent, however, if the reagent had only type 1 specificity. The anti-A and anti-H (O) reagents which gave the best staining patterns in benign tissues were used in malignant tissues. No cancer was found to express A antigen but eight of the nine prostatic cancers were positive for the H (O) antigen irrespective of blood group. Using fresh frozen material and appropriate reagents, BGA may be reproducibly detected in the epithelium of all non-malignant prostates, suggesting that a significant component of BGA is probably lipid-based on type 2 carbohydrate backbone chains. Further studies of changes in BGA expression in prostatic cancer are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "The phenomenon of sympathetic orchiopathia, in which ischaemia of one testis results in histological damage to the contralateral testis, is now well documented. This study used immunocytochemical techniques to investigate whether this damage is caused by antibody penetrating the \"blood-testis\" barrier and affecting spermatogenic and supporting cells of the seminiferous tubules. It has been demonstrated that IgM antibodies breach the \"blood-testis\" barrier of the contralateral testis 7 days after infarction and that they are replaced by IgG antibodies after 28 days. Cells affected are the epithelial cells of the membrana propria, the Sertoli cells and immature spermatogenic cells. Beyond 28 days after infarction no significant amounts of antibody of either class were demonstrated within the seminiferous tubules of contralateral testes.\r"

  ".W": "Neural control of the penile artery and vein of dogs was investigated using isometric tension recording and microelectrode methods. Field stimulation evoked twitch-like contractions of these two vessels and these contractions were blocked by guanethidine. In the artery, twitch-like contractions were more effectively blocked by yohimbine than by prazosin. During high tone of arterial and venous tissues evoked by noradrenaline (NA) in the presence of guanethidine, field stimulation evoked muscle relaxation that was not affected by atropine but was abolished by tetrodotoxin. In parallel to the mechanical responses, field stimulation evoked excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) in both arterial and venous smooth muscle cells. In the case of the artery, an action potential was superimposed on the EJP. The NA-induced contraction was suppressed by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), dose-dependently. On the other hand, alpha, beta-methylene-ATP did not affect the muscle relaxation induced by field stimulation. These results indicate that the penile artery and vein of the dog are innervated by adrenergic excitatory nerves and non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic inhibitory nerves. The transmitter possibly involved in the latter is discussed.\r"

In a double-blind crossover study, 18 impotent men received either a 2 ml injection of a solution containing 30 mg papaverine and 1 mg phentolamine or a similar volume of normal saline into the corpus cavernosum. The immediate and delayed effects (4 weeks later) were assessed independently and the alternative injection then given. All injections with papaverine and phentolamine were followed by an immediate increase in penile length and rigidity, and 70% of these patients were able to have sexual intercourse for periods of 1 to 4 weeks. No change in penile length or rigidity occurred following the saline injection and only one patient showed some improvement in erection over the next 4 weeks. In the crossover study, no patient developed any increase in length or rigidity of the penis following injection of saline, and improvement in spontaneous erection occurred in only two cases. In contrast, all patients who received papaverine and phentolamine had an increase in penile length and rigidity, and 50% were able to have normal sexual intercourse over the next 4 weeks. This study confirms the value of a combination of vasoactive agents in the management of impotence, irrespective of its aetiology, and suggests that any placebo effect is minimal in this group of patients with considerable psychological overlay.\r"

The indications for splenectomy were for the diagnosis of unknown cause (n = 5), for the relief of pain (n = 8), as the initial treatment of hairy cell or prolymphocytic leukaemia (n = 8), and for the correction of a haematological cytopenia (n = 26). Splenectomy was completely successful in relieving pain and in establishing a diagnosis, and provided effective palliation in patients with hairy cell and prolymphocytic leukaemia. An immediate correction of a haematological cytopenia was achieved in 24 patients, and the correction was maintained for over 1 year in 11 patients. There were no postoperative deaths and morbidity was acceptably low. We conclude that patients with massive splenomegaly can derive considerable benefit from splenectomy and that massive splenomegaly should not be regarded as a contra-indication to splenectomy.\r"

Six were treated without operation. Eighty-one patients were treated surgically. Sixteen cases with type I splenic injury were subject to simple splenorrhaphy, and twenty-three cases with type II splenic injury underwent splenorrhaphy plus omentoplasty. Twenty-four cases had type III splenic injury; of these, 20 were treated by ligation of the splenic artery (the main splenic artery in 14 cases and the upper segmental artery in six cases) with splenorrhaphy and omentoplasty, and the remaining four cases were treated by partial splenectomy and omentoplasty. In 16 of the 18 patients with type IV splenic injury, splenectomy was inevitable and heterotopic splenic autotransplantation was added. In the remaining two cases, it was possible partially to preserve the spleen. No complication was observed due to any of these spleen-saving procedures. Moreover, splenic implants increased complement C3 levels and improved filtration function. Despite other injuries, the mortality rate of this group was 5.7 per cent. The splenic salvage rate was 82 per cent.\r"

The outcome regarding the disease and the immediate and long-term complications of splenectomy in this group of 185 patients are presented. Splenectomy has an acceptably low morbidity, even in patients with serious haematological disease, in the hands of an experienced surgical team, where there is close co-operation between surgeon and haematologist. Occasionally, late overwhelming infections may occur, despite prophylaxis with penicillin and pneumococcal vaccination. It seems likely that, in their zeal to report such hazards, authors may allow the pendulum against splenectomy to swing too far, in the direction of leaving patients, especially adults, with considerable symptoms and poor health, rather than risk the occasional consequences of the asplenic state.\r"

All benign tumours were cured by local treatment. Malignant tumours can be identified clinically; the only consistent microscopic feature was invasion of the muscularis propria. All patients with malignant tumours died, despite radical surgical treatment; lymph node metastases were invariably present in the operation specimens. Because radical treatment for malignant carcinoid tumours of the anorectum is largely unsuccessful, a flexible surgical approach is advocated.\r"

The difference in rectal ornithine decarboxylase activities between cancer patients, 3.58, and controls was also significant, P = 0.001.

This type of operation may be the treatment of choice in the elderly, where an abdominal procedure is considered unwise and in cases of rectal prolapse associated with faecal incontinence.\r"

To evaluate more precisely the effectiveness of BAS, 22 patients in Group I (Group I-ST) and 26 patients in Group II (Group II-ST) who were operated upon by the same surgeon during the same period were reviewed retrospectively. The selection of patients for the use of BAS was randomized. In Group I-ST, one patient had a minor leak; no major leaks or operative deaths occurred. Two of the twenty-six patients in Group II-ST had minor leaks and one patient had a major leak causing death. This new technique for pancreaticojejunostomy using a biological adhesive system may be useful for preventing anastomotic leaks, especially in a patient with a normal pancreas.\r"

We identified 378 episodes of acute pancreatitis (196 males and 182 females). The mean annual incidence for first attacks of acute pancreatitis was 242 per million of the population. The commonest aetiology was biliary tract disease (30 per cent of males and 53 per cent of females). Alcohol related pancreatitis occurred in 26.5 per cent of males but only 3 per cent of females.

At initial presentation 14 patients were unemployed (37 per cent) and 11 worked as unskilled labourers (29 per cent). Twenty-seven patients (71 per cent) required more than one hospital admission. Surgery was indicated in 14 patients (37 per cent): 4 diagnostic laparotomy, 3 cholecystectomy, 3 drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst and 1 pancreatic abscess, 3 biliary bypass and 4 pancreatic resection. Four patients required more than one operative procedure. Five deaths occurred during the study period: one following biliary bypass, one following total pancreatectomy and three not directly related to pancreatitis. Follow-up attendance rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 76, 47 and 34 per cent respectively. Alcohol induced pancreatitis in Teesside, UK, is a disease of young adult males of lower socio-economic status with a recurring pattern leading to repeated hospital admissions and an unexpectedly high incidence of surgery. The study demonstrates the problem of ascertaining data related to long term follow-up in a condition where, despite intensive efforts, patient compliance is poor.\r"

Eighty-eight patients with AP were included. Amylase, lipase, trypsin and the P3 amylase fraction were measured in serum obtained at the time of discharge. Patients were followed for 60 days after discharge and divided into two groups: 75 patients who did not have complications, of whom 22.6 per cent displayed elevation of one or more pancreatic enzymes at discharge (17.3 per cent hypertrypsinaemia, 9.3 per cent hyperlipasaemia and 6.6 per cent P3 fraction); and 13 patients who had an unsatisfactory outcome (4 died, 4 developed a pseudocyst and 5 presented with recurrent pancreatitis). All of the latter group had an increase in at least one enzyme at the time of discharge (92.3 per cent P3 fraction, 69.2 per cent trypsin, 15.3 per cent lipase, and 7.6 per cent amylase). Both the persistence of the P3 fraction and hypertrypsinaemia were significantly more frequent in patients with an unfavourable outcome than in those with an uncomplicated course (P less than 0.001). On the other hand, persistent elevation of total amylase and lipase were unrelated to outcome. The hospitalization time was similar in both groups (good outcome 21.4 +/- 1.9 days, unfavourable outcome 17.3 +/- 5.3 days). It is concluded that the presence of P3 amylase fraction or hypertrypsinaemia at the time of discharge from hospital in a patient with acute pancreatitis suggests a risk of a later complication. Careful surveillance until enzyme levels become normal is urged. It is suggested that isoamylase P3 determination is the most sensitive assay to screen for the complications of acute pancreatitis.\r"

The incidence of complications correlated well with the pre-operative peak expiratory flow rate when it was less than 65 per cent of the predicted normal value. However, the predictive ability of peak expiratory flow rate was much less than the patient's age, pre-operative serum albumin level, pre-operative Pa,O2 and number of surgical wounds when all risk factors were considered. Significantly more complications occurred when the patient was greater than 65 years old, Pa,O2 was less than 10 kPa, serum albumin was less than 39 g/l and when the operation required three incisions. These findings may serve as guidelines for identification of high-risk patients in the future.\r"

The test involves swallowing a 10 ml poached egg white bolus labelled with 99mTc sodium pertechnetate and external scanning by a gamma camera. An on-line computer program allows detailed analysis by the condensed image technique (which demonstrates the pattern of oesophageal transit) and activity-time curves for the whole, the upper, middle and lower thirds of the oesophagus. The reproducibility of the test is good (coefficient of variation of the total transit of 14 per cent). The results on the normal volunteers have shown that oesophageal transit slows in an aboral direction with transit being faster in the upper, when compared with the middle and lower thirds. The test clearly differentiates patients with oesophageal disease from the normal. The condensed image analysis appears to be useful in outlining the pattern of transit in patients with motility disorders. Patients with reflux oesophagitis have delayed oesophageal transit.\r"

Only 12 were found to have specific motility disorders such as achalasia and scleroderma. A total of 147 had a variety of non-specific motility disorders and, of these, 112 (76.2 per cent) had coexistent gastro-oesophageal reflux. There was a significant association between the symptoms of dysphagia and the occurrence of predominantly non-propagated motor activity in the oesophagus. A similarly significant relationship existed between crushing chest pain and oesophageal spasm. Despite this statistical association, detection and treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux was found to be the most useful part of clinical management. Symptoms of associated motility disorders resolved in more than 90 per cent of patients treated by Nissen fundoplication. Preoperative assessment of motility was of no value in detecting those who might develop postoperative dysphagia. Oesophageal manometry is useful for the assessment of a small proportion of patients with oesophageal symptoms in whom gastro-oesophageal reflux has been excluded by vigorous investigation, including 24 h pH recording.\r"

Group G patients received the operation under general anaesthesia, and their postoperative pain was relieved by intermittent injections of analgesics. Group PE received prolonged epidural analgesia with local anaesthetics during and after surgery. Group EM received epidural analgesia intra-operatively and epidural morphine postoperatively. Urinary nitrogen excretion during the first three postoperative days was significantly less in the PE and EM groups than in the G group, and the PE group excreted slightly less nitrogen than the EM group. In the G group, urinary excretion of adrenaline increased mainly on the day of operation, and noradrenaline chiefly on postoperative days. These catecholamine responses were almost completely abolished in the PE group, and significantly inhibited in the EM group. Plasma cortisol response was most remarkable shortly after the operation and then decreased in all groups, but was significantly lower in the two epidural groups than in the G group throughout the study. Plasma glucagon increased postoperatively in all groups, and the increase was less pronounced in both epidural groups than in the G group. These results suggested that an elevated sympathetic activity, represented by increased noradrenaline excretion and elicited by painful nociceptive and sympathetic nervous afferents, is responsible for the postoperative nitrogen loss which is mediated by glucagon and cortisol.\r"

Comparing the results in patients without complications (n = 99) with those in patients with complications (n = 18) and the results in patients who survived (n = 109) with those who died (n = 8), we found that only ALB, DH, TFN and PNI showed significant differences in both comparisons. Correlations of complications with combined parameters was made by multiple linear regression analysis; a modified PNI (mPNI), including these three single variables, has emerged. Considering its risk values, the nutritional parameters showed the following sensitivity and specificity, respectively: ALB less than 3.2 g/dl (72 and 71 per cent), anergy (67 and 64 per cent), TFN less than 205 mg/dl (67 and 55 per cent) and mPNI less than 20 (72 and 70 per cent). Using Bayes' theorems, ALB, DH and calculated indices showed the same predictive capacity and we conclude that single or multiple association of nutritional parameters have no additive effect. To predict complications of nutritional origin it seems only necessary to consider ALB, taking into account the type of operation and the normal duration of postoperative hospital stay without oral intake.\r"

We have examined the effect of pulsed infrared light from a 100 microseconds pulsed Nd-YAG laser on the dog aorta in order to determine the dose response, perforation thresholds and healing properties in vascular tissue. We used 100 microseconds pulses of 0.5 J energy at 10 Hz repetition rate via a 400 micron optical fibre to make 205 craters in 10 dogs at total energies of 5-25 J. The perforation threshold was 15 J in six animals and 20 J in four. The dose response was linear at 10 micron tissue vaporized per Joule delivered. Animals were killed immediately and at intervals of 24 h, 4, 7 and 10 days, 2, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months. Material was retrieved for histology and examined by light and scanning electron microscopy. The tissue exhibited features of laser damage that were less marked than those seen with continuous wave lasers; there was less heat damage surrounding the craters which healed well, even after perforation. This laser is likely to be suitable for human laser angioplasty provided the energy is given in increments of 15 J or less.\r"

The patients were randomly assigned to receive 10, 50 or 100 burns. Topical therapy was stopped for 1 week before treatment and for 1 week before reassessment 6 weeks later. Patients who received 50 or 100 burns had significant pressure reduction (p = 0.000). The difference in mean reduction between these two groups was not significant. Ten burns occasionally produced a reduction in pressure. Some patients may need fewer laser burns than are currently given, but most require the current treatment schedules.\r"

The high rate could not be attributed to the fact that a large number of the patients were from rural areas and thus may have had less access to medical care. The incidence rate of diabetes mellitus, 3.5%, appeared higher than would be expected on the basis of recent age-matched population surveys. Recommendations are made for preoperative assessment of cataract patients.\r"

All but 1 of 165 eligible families participated. The children underwent surgery between February and July 1981. The day-care surgery group (59 families) incurred average total time costs of 16.1 hours, compared with 37.1 hours for the inpatient surgery group (105 families), as parents in the latter group remained with their child during the longer hospital stay. Parents from out of town incurred the greater time and financial costs. In both groups parents of younger children tended to spend more time at the hospital than parents of older children. Type of surgical management was not a significant factor in out-of-pocket expenses. Loss of income was associated with employment of the mother as a professional or a manager and may reflect inequalities in access to compassionate leave between men and women in equivalent positions. Opening day-care surgery facilities on weekends might reduce the financial burden on working mothers. Overall, day-care surgery was found to be cost-effective for families.\r"

Previous cesarean section (in seven patients) was not the only predisposing factor: a history of dilatation and curettage (in two patients) or laparoscopy (in one) were also implicated. Long, obstructed labour did not appear to be a factor. Rupture also occurred in patients at low risk. The most frequent immediate complication was hypotension, in five patients. The rupture site was repaired in 11 of the patients; the other 4 underwent hysterectomy. Close surveillance and prompt intervention are the keys to good fetal and maternal outcome.\r"

The organism was detected in 105 (11.4%) of the patients. After adjustment for confounding variables, four variables were found to be independent risk factors for chlamydial infection: age 24 years or less (prevalence ratio 3.0 [p less than 0.001]), two or more sexual partners during the previous year (prevalence ratio 1.8 [p = 0.001]), no contraception or the use of a nonbarrier method (prevalence ratio 1.9 [p = 0.030]) and living in an urban area (prevalence ratio 1.6 [p = 0.046]). The results confirm that chlamydial infection is prevalent in this population. The identified risk factors may prove useful in determining the target population for screening programs.\r"

The heterozygotes had low-normal hemoglobin levels and mean corpuscular volumes; coexisting iron deficiency, present in 62% of these children, resulted in substantially lower hemoglobin levels, very low mean corpuscular volumes and lower than expected levels of hemoglobin E on electrophoresis. The children with hemoglobin EE were only slightly anemic, but those with hemoglobin E-beta-thalassemia had severe anemia and required long-term transfusion therapy. Nutritional factors and parasitic infestations were the main causes of iron depletion, which was common, particularly in children less than 2 years old (87%). Physicians of patients of Southeast Asian origin should be aware of the clinical and hematologic presentation of these hemoglobinopathies.\r"

A total of 38 episodes in 37 patients were documented; data were available on 37 episodes in 36 patients. The organism accounted for 3.8% of all cases of septicemia and 6.7% of cases of nosocomial septicemia and was associated with 0.03% of all admissions. The incidence remained stable over the 5 years. The rate of survival 28 days after the episode was 78%. Most of the episodes (31) originated from infected vascular access sites. Of the 37 isolates 15 (41%), all S. epidermidis, were slime producing. S. epidermidis accounted for 33 of the isolates; of the 33, 5 were methicillin-resistant and slime producing. Various in-vitro susceptibility testing methods and testing for beta-lactamase production yielded conflicting results. Methicillin resistance, slime production and speciation as S. epidermidis were not confirmed as virulence markers. Five patients with methicillin-resistant organisms were treated with cephalosporins, and all recovered. These findings as well as examination of the literature do not support the recommendations that laboratories report such isolates as resistant to all beta-lactam agents and that vancomycin be given in all such infections. The different case mix in community hospitals as compared with university centres results in different patterns of nosocomial infection. Since the community hospital patient population is much larger, more information on the patterns of infections in these centres is needed.\r"

No complications of the procedure were observed. In three children the foreign body could not be removed by this means; it was subsequently removed by endoscopy (in two cases, both of coins) or esophagotomy (in two cases, both of coins) or esophagotomy (in one, of a stone). When carefully performed, removal of blunt, recently ingested esophageal foreign bodies with a Foley catheter under fluoroscopic control is a safe mode of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the reasons for the increasing use of platelet concentrate in Canada, we undertook a 4-month study of platelet concentrate transfusion in six eastern Ontario hospitals in 1985. A total of 4801 units of platelet concentrate were transfused on 687 occasions to 303 patients; the average number of transfusions per patient was 2.3, the average number of units per transfusion 7.0 and the average number of units per patient 15.8. The cardiovascular service used the largest proportion of units (28%), aortocoronary bypass grafting being the most common procedure. The mean pretransfusion platelet count for the medical and oncology services was about 30.0 X 10(9)/L, compared with 155.5 X 10(9)/L for the cardiovascular service. An increment in platelet count 1 hour after transfusion was noted with 238 (75%) of the transfusions for which the data were available; the average increment was 3.4 X 10(9)/L per unit of platelet concentrate transfused. When the data for patients who did not respond were excluded, the average increment was 6.9 X 10(9)/L. Single-donor platelet concentrate was requested for only half of the transfusions to which no response was detected. The current medical literature supports the appropriate use of platelet concentrate in patients with thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy, but prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients undergoing cardiovascular bypass procedures is being questioned. We advise continued surveillance of the use of these products and re-evaluation of the aims of platelet transfusion therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The creatinine clearance was calculated in standard fashion from a timed urine specimen (measured creatinine clearance [MCC]) and from a previously published formula (estimated creatinine clearance [ECC]), in 55 instances, in 19 consecutive patients who were admitted to the hospital for treatment with cisplatin. Using creatinine excretion as an index of completeness of urine collection, there were 19 (35%) inaccurate collections. The correlation between creatinine clearances calculated by both methods was excellent (r = 0.684, P less than .001) and improved when inaccurate collections were excluded (r = 0.922, P less than 0.001). A discrepancy between the two methods of 25% or more was found in 19 collections. Using data from patients with two or more collections to test whether or not the two methods produced equally variable results, indicated that the MCC is a more variable, less reliable method than the ECC. In eight of 55 urine collections, the results of MCC were not used as a guide to chemotherapy and, in an additional 16 should have not been used because of inaccuracy in the urine collection. These results suggest that the creatinine clearance as calculated by an alternative method (ECC) should replace the use of MCC when assessment of the renal function is needed before the administration of nephrotoxic agents.\r"

  ".W": "The toxicity of high dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) in 23 leukemic children aged 1.5 years to 16 years 11 months was evaluated. The group included 11 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), nine with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), two with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) in blastic crisis, and one with Burkitt's lymphoma. Toxicity consisted of bone marrow suppression in all patients, with a mean nadir time of 11 days for platelets and granulocytes. All patients experienced nausea and vomiting; 12 of 23 had drug induced fever; seven of 23 conjunctivitis; five of 23 mucositis; four of 23 diarrhea, and one of 23 elevated transaminase with hyperbilirubinemia. Adverse reactions were mild and reversible in all patients. No serious neurologic toxicity was seen. The toxicity observed in four patients with prior cranial irradiation was not any different from nonirradiated patients. The only life-threatening effect was neutropenia, the consequences of which were generally well controlled with antibiotic therapy. While this agent was effective in induction of remission in AML patients resistant to standard doses of Ara-C, it had no significant effect in a very small number of patients with relapsed ALL and CML in blast crisis. Side effects of high dose Ara-C though relatively substantial are manageable enough to warrant wider scale efficacy trials of this agent in childhood leukemias and solid tumors.\r"

Assessment of the relation between specimen androgen receptor site content and survival using either scatterplots or Kaplan-Meier analyses showed specimen receptor content was a poor prognostic P greater than 0.1, of survival subsequent to orchiectomy or diethylstilbestrol (DES) therapy. The possibility that heterogeneity of specimen androgen receptor site content contributed to this finding was evaluated by comparing receptor content of multiple small or large tissue specimens from the same prostate gland of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or nonmetastatic prostatic cancer. This evaluation showed significant microheterogeneity of human prostate androgen receptor site content which was substantially masked in large tissue specimens. We conclude that microheterogeneity of human prostate androgen receptor site content compromises the use of biopsy specimen androgen receptor measurements as a prognostic of patient survival subsequent to initiation of hormonal therapy.\r"

Five prognostic factors influenced survival: axillary node status, primary T stage, length of disease-free interval, and number and size of recurrences. Four prognostic factors influenced the local control: axillary node status, primary T stage, disease-free interval, and number of recurrences. Patients with three or more, out of five, favorable prognostic factors fared much better than those with two or less: 75% versus 15% survival at 5 years.

A prospective, published pilot study confirmed this added risk and demonstrated the importance of the family history of cancer as a marker of potential malignancy. The study group was enlarged to include 471 asymptomatic adult, first degree relatives of patients having large bowel neoplasia (cancer or adenomatous polyps) but without polyposis syndromes. These first degree relatives were screened by fecal occult blood examinations and flexible sigmoidoscopy, followed by colonoscopy when indicated. Adenomatous polyps or cancer were found in 8.1% of the study group as compared with 3.7% in a comparison group of screens, not having the same family history of neoplasia and undergoing similar screening tests. Of the study group the age-adjusted rate for colorectal adenomas or cancer increased threefold (P less than 0.001) for subjects older than 40 years and an even higher fivefold relative risk was found for large bowel cancer only (P = 0.01). This was true even if there was only one relative with colorectal neoplasia (P less than 0.01) but was even more pronounced among those having more than one affected relative. The results confirm the usefulness of the family history, of even one member with large bowel neoplasia, in isolating a group at high risk for these lesions. This group would most likely benefit from regular cancer and adenomatous polyp screening particularly when older than 40 years.\r"

Group 1 consisted of 20 patients who had progressive metastatic breast cancer and echocardiography performed on a routine basis as a part of a clinical trial involving 38 patients. All 20 had small unexpected effusions, and only one patient developed symptomatic malignant pericardial disease late in her clinical course. Group 2 consisted of 32 patients who were without evidence of metastatic disease at the time of positive echocardiography and the etiology was considered benign in all patients. Six patients required pericardiectomy, five for severe radiation induced pericarditis and one for amyloid. No patient developed proven or suspected malignant pericardial disease. Group 3 comprised 38 patients who had known metastatic disease outside the pericardium at the time of positive echocardiography. Nineteen patients in Group 3 had histologically proven malignant involvement during life or at autopsy, and five more had suspected malignant pericardial disease. Ten patients initially were treated with pericardiectomy and 28 patients were managed with systemic therapy alone (24 patients) or with pericardiocentesis (four patients). Among the 12 patients with malignant effusion treated without surgery, proven local progression of pericardial disease occurred in six, with sudden death in two of those patients. No patient treated initially with surgery suffered progression of her pericardial disease. It was concluded that: small, clinically unsuspected pericardial effusions appear to be relatively common in women with metastatic breast cancer; no patient with clinical pericardial disease confirmed on echocardiography and no evidence of metastatic breast cancer developed malignant pericardial involvement; 50% of patients with known metastatic disease and a clinically apparent pericardial effusion had malignant pericardial disease; and nonsurgical therapy in patients with histologically proven or clinically suspected malignant pericardial effusion was associated with a high incidence of progressive pericardial disease.\r"

Weeks 1 to 6 continuous (24 hours) infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 300 mg/m2/d; weeks 6 to 10 or 12 infusional 5-FU administered concomitantly with radiation to the primary tumor site using standard fractionation with a cumulative median dose of 5000 rad; range 4400 to 6900 rad. Surgery was performed in five patients. All patients were evaluable for assessing response to the initial 5-FU infusion and 11/13 patients demonstrated tumor regression. Of 12 evaluable patients subsequently receiving combined infusional 5-FU and concomitant radiation, all 12 achieved complete clinical (10) or pathologic (two) tumor regression. Two of five patients having surgical resection had no pathologic evidence of tumor. All patients had relief of dysphagia within 1 week of initiating chemotherapy. Acute complications of therapy included stomatitis (two patients); hand-foot syndrome (two patients), and subclavian vein thrombosis (two patients). Stricture requiring periodic dilation occurred in three patients, and one patient developed a tracheoesophageal fistula at 36 months. Local control was maintained in 12/13 evaluable patients. Four of 13 patients were alive and without disease at 12 to 46 months. Nine patients died of distant metastases at 6 to 40 months. Median survival for the whole group was 16 months. Ten of the 13 patients (77%) survived for more than 1 year and 3/13 (22%) survived more than 3 years. This pilot study demonstrates the activity of 5-FU administered on an infusion schedule in both squamous and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the capacity to deliver infusional 5-FU throughout standard fractionation radiation. The local control and survival data may provide a basis for expanded Phase II trials, and a comparative trial against surgery alone might also be justified.\r"

  ".W": "This retrospective study of 44 patients who received postoperative radiotherapy soon after hysterectomy for early Stage IB to IIA carcinoma of the cervix was undertaken to determine the need for additional vaginal cuff irradiation (AVCI) following external pelvic irradiation (EPI). The reasons for adjuvant radiotherapy administration were mostly the nonradical type of performed hysterectomy or the presence of adverse prognostic histopathologic features. The overall survival and local control rates were 80% (35/44) and 89% (39/44) at 2 years and 63% (26/41) and 80% (33/41) at 5 years, respectively. Although the 2-year results seemed to indicate that AVCI was necessary, this was not supported by the obtained longer term data. Moreover, it appeared that AVCI could perhaps be safely done after EPI, when occult early-stage cervical carcinoma was found after total abdominal hysterectomy. Data from this study and the literature concerning AVCI's appropriate role in this particular disease condition are discussed.\r"

Induction chemotherapy was administered in 34 cases of nonmetastatic soft tissue sarcomas. All patients had large tumors for which only mutilating surgery, if any, was possible. In 21 patients, a combination of Adriamycin (doxorubicin), cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, vindesine, and DTIC (DCPAV) produced two complete remissions (CR) and 6 partial remissions (PR). A combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin, and DTIC (CYVADIC) produced three PR in eight patients, and a combination of Adriamycin and ifosfamide (AI) produced two PR in five patients. After two to seven cycles of chemotherapy, 24 patients underwent surgery. In 19, gross tumor excision was performed; 12 proved to be microscopically fully resected. Disease in two patients entered CR with chemotherapy alone, but surgery was performed in both patients as well. Irradiation was administered in ten patients to produce or insure CR (eight cases of residual disease postoperatively), and in two patients with unresectable disease. Four patients with disease in CR after surgery also received radiation due to the initial massive tumor size. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves at 2 years showed 18% total survival in the patients in whom CR of disease was not achieved, and 80% survival in patients with disease in CR. Of the 22 patients with disease in CR (by all means), disease-free survival was 1 to 44 months (mean, 13.7). Disease currently remains in CR in ten patients with a mean follow-up of 13.6 months (3 to 34 months from end of therapy). Ten patients had a local recurrence following a CR after 3 to 44 months (mean, 15.3 months).\r"

Routine stained marrow smears appeared normal. Six of 13 patients demonstrated abnormal colony/cluster formation. Four patients had no colony formation at all. Ten of 12 patients showed decreased sensitivity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) to PGE inhibition. The studies suggest that defects in myelopoiesis are detectable in patients treated for germ cell tumors with combination chemotherapy. The clinical significance of these findings requires long-term follow-up and surveillance for overt hematopoietic abnormalities in survivors of testicular cancer.\r"

The tumor showed extensive necrosis, but the clinical effects were relatively short-lived and the patient died 11 weeks later. Biopsy specimens taken early in apheresis showed intense new infiltration of tumor by lymphocytes and monocytes; later biopsy specimens showed predominantly plasma cells with trapping and lysis of tumor cells. No other anti-cancer therapies had been used for 16 months before this trial, and no replacements were given other than saline and albumin.\r"

  ".W": "Toxicity of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Pasteur strain, given in a dose of 120 mg once a week for 6 weeks, was retrospectively evaluated in a study of 107 patients with recurrent superficial bladder cancer. Only six patients had no symptoms of toxicity. Severe cystitis (ten patients) was most likely to occur in those with decreased bladder compliance before treatment. Systemic symptoms resembling those of influenza (flu) were severe in six patients. Potentially serious complications occurred in six patients. Overall, toxic reactions were mild and self limited, and toxicity often could be easily managed by a reduction in the BCG dose (17 patients), temporary interruption of treatment (five patients), or cessation (four patients). Late occurrence of bladder granulomas (32 patients) and cystoscopic appearance of significant cystitis (55 patients) did not correlate with posttreatment voiding symptoms, and these changes were temporary and confined to the first 6 months after treatment. There were no cases of late bladder contracture, and none of the patients free of voiding symptoms before treatment had such symptoms afterward. Extravesical granulomas were observed in 37 patients and were the cause of obstruction of the urinary tract in nine. Pretreatment skin reactivity did not correlate with toxicity, and concurrent percutaneous administration of BCG had no effect on toxicity. BCG has a cumulative effect, so increased toxicity is to be expected during long-term administration. BCG toxicity is primarily a response of the cell-mediated immune system, and transient local or systemic infection appears to be important. This fact suggests that immunosuppression is a relative contraindication to BCG use.\r"

Those tissue culture data are still cited as evidence supporting that the mesothelial cell has multipotentiality of differentiation and the mesothelial cell is a sole precursor of malignant mesothelioma cells. Six cell lines of heterotransplanted human malignant mesothelioma in nude mice and one cell line of subcultured human malignant mesothelioma in vitro have been established. To establish the validity of the classic concept of multipotentiality of malignant mesothelioma, we studied malignant mesothelioma cells of the seven cases using in vivo cultures, xenografts in nude mice and an in vitro tissue culture, utilizing histology, histochemistry, immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. The nature of the original malignant mesothelioma cells was clearly shown to be well preserved in both the heterotransplanted and subcultured cells. Data did not support earlier hypotheses that mesothelial cells are capable of differentiating into distinct cell lines. The mesothelial cell and the submesothelial connective tissue cells are the precursors of the neoplastic cells in malignant mesothelioma.\r"

In the patients with ovarian cancer the sensitivities of LSA and CA 125 for patients with clinical evidence of disease were 71% and 76% respectively; the specificities for patients with no clinical evidence of disease were 90% and 86% respectively. Using both tumor markers, a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 85% was obtained. Additionally, CA 125 was elevated in 59% of patients with clinically advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, and LSA was elevated in 63% of patients with clinical evidence of cervical cancer. Neither CEA nor CA 19-9 levels correlated with clinical status in patients with ovarian or cervical cancer. The values of Ca 125 and LSA were examined in relation to the findings at second-look surgery in patients with ovarian cancer. Absence of elevated tumor markers does not obviate the need for second-look surgery; the false negative rate for CA 125 was 40% (6/15). However, the finding of two elevated plasma markers 1 month or more apart, in ovarian cancer patients who were clinically free of disease, was strongly suggestive of recurrent cancer; 13 of 14 such patients showed this association. This latter finding may help to identify a group of patients in whom early surgical intervention is indicated.\r"

We collected 100 consecutive lung cancer cases, including 35 autopsies and 65 surgical resections, which were extensively sampled (average, ten blocks per case) and analyzed for histologic heterogeneity. Slides were randomized and classified by five pathologists using the 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme. Five-year follow-up data were obtained for the surgical cases, and detailed information on staging and survival from time of diagnosis was available in 91 cases. Survival time was analyzed with respect to the patient's age, sex, stage, predominant histologic pattern, and presence or absence of major heterogeneity. The latter is defined as the presence on at least one slide of a major histologic pattern different from that of the remaining slides for that case. The only statistically significant predictor of survival was tumor stage (P less than 0.0001). Heterogeneous tumors appeared to have a worse survival, but this did not reach statistical significance. There was no relationship between survival and predominant histologic pattern (cell type), sex, or age.\r"

Of these 199 patients, 147 had estrogen receptor data available. There were 104 patients (71%) who were estrogen receptor negative, and 16 (15%) had developed local or distant recurrence with a median follow-up of 44 months. Five patients had died of breast cancer. Of the 43 patients who were estrogen receptor positive, there was one recurrence, and no breast cancer deaths. This difference in recurrence is statistically significant (P less than 0.01) by the log-rank probability test. Of the 17 patients with recurrent disease, 14 (82%) had primary tumors 2 cm or larger in size. If only those patients with tumors 2 cm or larger are considered, 23% (13/57) who were estrogen receptor negative and 5% (1/19) who were estrogen receptor positive recurred. This remains statistically significant (P less than 0.025). We conclude that tumor hormone receptor status and size of tumor are significant prognostic factors in identifying premenopausal, node negative women at risk for recurrent disease.\r"

Measurements were made using a dextran-coated charcoal technique involving a seven-point Scatchard plot analysis. In carcinoma of the cervix significant numbers of ERc (greater than 3 fmol/mg protein) were found in 41% of the cases, and of PRc (greater than 3 fmol/mg protein) in 30%; only 28% of the 56 cases contained both ERc and PRc. In the normal cervices, 59% contained significant levels of ERc and 41% significant levels of PRc. No correlation was found between ERc and PRc and menopausal status of the patient, stage, cell type, or histologic grade of the tumor. A weak (P = 0.063) correlation between the presence of PRc and length of survival was also found, but there was no correlation between ERc and survival. Unlike the situation for breast cancer, measurement of ERc and PRc appears to add little of value to the clinical management of cervical carcinoma.\r"

Thirty one patients had documentation of nodal disease only (Stage IVA). Nine patients had histologic evidence of visceral involvement (Stage IVB). A wide variety of topical, regional and/or systemic therapies were used in the management of these patients. The median survival for the entire group was 14.5 months. Eleven patients (28%) obtained a complete response (CR) and had a median survival of 21 months as compared with 8 months among 29 patients not obtaining a CR. One patient is without evidence of disease (NED) at 10 years. Multiple prognostic factors were examined with respect to survival. Prognostic factors found to be significant at the P = 0.05 level included ECMF at presentation of skin disease (versus at the time of relapse), the ability to achieve a CR, and management incorporating the use of topical therapy, especially electron beam treatment. Tabulation of all trials of chemotherapy either at diagnosis of ECMF or subsequently revealed that cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (CVP) and cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (COP-Bleo) were the most effective chemotherapeutic combinations. In a multivariate analysis with survival as the endpoint, the best model consisted of only two covariates: ECMF at presentation of skin disease, and the use of topical therapy. Other covariates found not to be significant at the P = 0.05 level included age, gender, clinical extent of cutaneous and extracutaneous disease, Stage IVA versus Stage IVB disease, the presence of Sezary cells in the peripheral blood smear, and management incorporating the use of systemic therapy.\r"

The observed rates are fitted to a log-linear model in order to examine the effect of each of the three variables, age, period and cohort, simultaneously for each sex. For Connecticut incidence, there is little evidence of either an increase or decrease from 1865 to 1955 birth cohorts. For the US mortality rates, from the 1875 to 1950 birth cohorts, there is a decline by more than twofold in men and more than threefold in women. Monitoring of those trends is discussed with respect to increases in exposure to cigarette smoking and formaldehyde. Regarding the age distribution, both incidence and mortality data are consistent: men show a linear increase of the log (rate) with log (age) in a fashion characteristic of other epithelial nongynecologic malignancies; for women, in contrast, there is a downward curvature around age 50 followed by an upward curvature in the 55 to 70 age range. The rate in most postmenopausal age groups is 20% to 67% of the rate expected on the basis of a linear increase of the log (rate) with log (age). The age patterns in women are similar to \"Clemmesen's hook\" observed for female breast cancer. There is evidence that the pattern in female subjects differs significantly from that for male subjects. The female age pattern requires confirmation in other populations. An etiologic role for sex hormones is hypothesized in view of that age distribution and in view of physiologic and laboratory observations.\r"

In Sapporo City, the capital of Hokkaido Prefecture, the condition of the three parameters improved significantly after the institution of mass screening (e.g., the 48-month survival rate improved--from 21.3% to 87.5%). In Hokkaido Prefecture (Sapporo City excluded), however, where the mass screening had not yet been performed, no significant change was observed in any of the three parameters (48-month survival rate changed only from 21.1% to 28.1%).

To measure the technical transfer or scientific transfer, the American College of Surgeons successfully conducted national surveys of the 50 states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The analysis of such data has shown that between 1970 and 1983 the 2-year survival of nonseminomatous testicular cancer to have been improved from 74% to 92%. Similarly recorded improvements have been documented for both localized and regionalized prostatic cancer from 1974 through 1984 in some cases where the improvements have exceeded an improvement in 5-year survival rate exceeding a net 10%.

Pelvic lymphadenectomy usually is performed with radical cystectomy for bladder cancer and may confer therapeutic benefit on patients having only minimal nodal involvement. A limited extraperitoneal pelvic lymphadenectomy, including only the nodes surrounding the obturator nerves, is performed in prostate cancer patients who are considered to be potential candidates for radical prostatectomy, but is of doubtful therapeutic benefit. The effectiveness of chemotherapy for germ-cell testicular tumors has diminished the utilization of routine surgical staging and also has decreased the scope of lymphadenectomy when performed. The substantial complications associated with traditional ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy for carcinoma of the penis and the unreliability of aspiration or excisional node biopsy have militated against routine surgical staging of patients having clinically negative nodes. This policy should be reconsidered in light of suboptimal treatment results and newer surgical techniques.\r"

Data from the studies of the American College of Surgeons and from the National Cancer Institute document these trends. For prostate cancer, the 5-year survival rate, for all stages, increased during the 1970s. Although seminomas of the testes have had high survival rates for several years, nonseminomas have had much poorer outcomes. Data from the 1985 survey of the American College of Surgeons indicate that the prognosis for nonseminoma tumors of the testes is now much improved. Analyses have been conducted to assess the influence of patient and tumor characteristics on end results. Age, race, stage and, histologic type continue to be the major determinants of survival. The role of treatment setting also has been studied. The data reveal that outcomes for similar patients differ little among hospitals which meet approval standards for operation of a cancer program. Issues regarding validity of the observations and the influence of \"stage migration\" on the end results have been examined. The distribution of survival improvements across stages, and, the correlation of changing survival with improved patterns of care may suggest that the improvements in urologic cancer outcomes are more than statistical artifacts.\r"

If clinical Stage II disease is evident, radiotherapy versus primary chemotherapy is being studied. Primary chemotherapy is treatment of choice for clinical Stage III disease. Postchemotherapy radiographic lesions are safe to follow without surgical extirpation as they are usually necrotic. Surveillance for clinical Stage I disease is another option. For nonseminoma, clinical Stage I disease has been managed with staging RPLND. But 70% of such cases will have negative nodes. Hence, primary surveillance studies are under way, with chemotherapy reserved for those who relapse clinically (estimated 95% survival). Sadly, surveillance has not been effective when applied on an ad hoc basis at the community level. Problems are compliance, delayed detection of relapse, nonreporting of failures. Clinical Stage II disease is managed with RPLND. Adjuvant, limited postoperative chemotherapy is an option versus no postoperative chemotherapy followed by full chemotherapy for those who relapse as Stage III disease later. Another option under study for Stage II disease is primary chemotherapy with RPLND surgery reserved for those who achieve only a partial remission.\r"

The urologist and pathologist are chiefly responsible for collecting this information, but other laboratory approaches also are being developed.

The integration of clinical stage, histologic grade, and pelvic lymph node evaluation has improved the selection of the ideal candidate for radical prostatectomy. In men with localized disease, there is no evidence that any treatment other than radical prostatectomy produces better control of the primary lesion and of distant metastases than does total surgical excision of the prostate. Recently the morbidity of radical prostatectomy has been reduced by improvements in surgical technique. Intraoperative identification and preservation of the branches of the pelvic plexus that innervate the corpora cavernosa has resulted in long-term postoperative potency rates of 70% without compromising complete excision of the tumor. Thus it appears possible today to preserve sexual function in a majority of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy without compromising the cancer operation, an observation that may encourage more physicians to take greater interest in diagnosing prostatic cancer in young men at a stage when it is still curable.\r"

Accurate preoperative staging is therefore of critical importance, and computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are the most accurate staging modalities. The traditional operative procedure for RCC has been the radical nephrectomy with excision of Gerota's fascia and its contents, resulting in a 60% to 70% 5-year survival of patients with localized tumors (T1-2 and N0 and M0). Extensive lymphadenectomy has not appreciably improved the cure rate. Indeed, less aggressive surgery has been recently proposed by some authors, based on the excellent results achieved after partial nephrectomy or for tumors in solitary kidneys, with survival after partial nephrectomy or enucleation similar to that after radical nephrectomy. Preoperative adjuvants such as angioinfarction or radiotherapy have not increased survival or local tumor control, and no regional or systemic postoperative adjuvant has proven to be of value. Until further data is accumulated, radical nephrectomy remains the treatment of choice for localized RCC.\r"

Psychological preparation is an intrinsic component of early doctor-patient interactions, whether or not the physician and patient perceive it as such. Guidelines for the pivotal discussion concerning diagnosis and treatment plan are provided. The results of a survey of psychosocial adaptation among 39 patients treated for seminomatous testicular cancer and 39 controls are presented. Patients were found to exhibit typical or average emotional status. They were significantly more satisfied than controls with spouse/partner relationships. Despite important sexual and reproductive limitations reported by others, patients treated for testicular cancer adapt well, and most attain average or better degrees of satisfaction with interpersonal and sexual relationships. Newly diagnosed patients, beginning their adjustment to what often appears to be an overwhelming set of problems and potential limitations, should benefit from the knowledge that psychosocial adaptation is an eventual reality. Physicians' management of early discussions, as well as their openness to ongoing communication, contribute importantly to the perspective that will guide patients and families through this process.\r"

Some cancer treatments damage the physiological systems involved in reproduction. All have a psychological impact on sexuality. For men with prostate cancer, current issues in sexual rehabilitation include the debate on nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, the role of vascular damage in causing erectile dysfunction after radiotherapy, and the need for a better understanding of hormonal effects on central and peripheral mechanisms of sexual function. In the treatment of men and women with bladder cancer, the sexual function morbidity of radical cystectomy is described in data from prospective interview studies. Sexual desire and orgasm remain normal after surgery despite disruption of the genital vasocongestion accompanying sexual arousal. Long-term follow-up studies of testicular cancer patients suggest that some increase in sexual dysfunction does occur. Infertility remains a concern for a subgroup of younger, childless men. Attempts to modify or eliminate retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy are discussed, as is recovery of spermatogenesis after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Sexual function in patients with penile, urethral, or renal cell carcinoma is briefly reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "As the success rate of earlier diagnosis and more effective cancer therapy increases, more individuals are finding that they are living with a cancer diagnosis. Cancer, as a chronic illness, requires that all health care professionals view the patient from a perspective of functional abilities rather than from a disease process. Rehabilitation is a dynamic process and is generally goal-directed. The goal of rehabilitation is to help the individual to function at his maximum level within the limitations and constraints of the disease and treatment protocols (Dudas, 1984). The physical, mental, emotional, social, sexual, and economic potential of the individual are the broad areas involved in the assessment, plan, implementation, and evaluation of rehabilitation programs. The rehabilitation team consists of the oncologist, surgeon, nurse, social worker, physical therapist, occupational therapist, nutritionist, and others depending on the special needs of the individual. The most important members of the team are the patient and family. The patient involved on the team can help to identify specific needs throughout the trajectory of the cancer diagnosis and treatment. The spouse and friends of the patient with cancer are important support systems and assist the patient in exploring feelings and needs (Frank-Stomborg and Wright, 1984). Dietz (1980) described four rehabilitation stages for cancer programs: preventive, restorative, supportive, and palliative. During each phase of rehabilitation the physical, mental, emotional, social, sexual, and economic needs of the patient must be considered. This report identifies specific areas of concern for the patient and family during the four stages of rehabilitation and to identify potential action plans for individual patients.\r"

  ".W": "The term quality of life (QL) is a global characterization usually consisting of the following factors: physical function, symptoms from disease and/or treatment, occupational and social interactions, and psychological parameters, including mood with some overall assessment of well-being, such as happiness or satisfaction. For the purposes of individual patient management, the physician often assesses many of these in the process of making decisions about cancer care. The aggregate assessment of QL in groups of patients is more difficult. The increasing subjectivity and difficulty in measurement as medical observers move from the physical (objective parameters) to the psychosocial (subjective parameters) has hindered our ability to study QL. The changing status of the patient from initial symptomatic disease, to the incapacitation related to the treatment and/or the ongoing course of the disease often leading to death makes the measurement of QL a moving target. One must be very specific as to the malignancy, the status of disease, the treatments with their side effects and sequela, and the time of measurement in this dynamic spectrum, if the data is to be comparable and to permit generalizations. For the purposes of clinical trials the emphasis remains with the physical factors: function and symptom control. Even these factors are difficult to assess consistently, making the aggregation of such data from similarly treated groups of patients sometimes suspect. The ability to determine the impact of disease and treatment on these factors in a reliable manner could make possible, with aggregated data from many patients, more objective assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of a particular therapy. Late sequelae of treatment may also be important. When cure or prolonged survival are not likely or possible then the ability to determine the probable effects, physical and psychosocial, of a specific treatment on an individual patient is valuable. Treatment then can be guided to some extent by QL considerations.\r"

Of urologic cancers, bladder cancer has been the most intensively studied epidemiologically. Cigarette smoking is the most important known preventable cause of the disease. Occupational exposures continue to come under suspicion. It appears that neither coffee drinking nor use of artificial sweeteners are important risk factors. Current questions in the etiology of prostate cancer concern its relationships to benign prostatic hypertrophy, to components of the diet and to hormone metabolism. Little is known of the etiology of kidney cancer other than probable associations of the disease with cigarette smoking and exposure to asbestos. Testicular cancer is associated with undescended testis and possibly other urogenital anomalies. The relationships of testicular cancer to pesticide exposure, in utero estrogen exposure, and infection are current research issues.\r"

When altered by mutation, deletion, translocation or amplification in cancer cells, proto-oncogenes may disrupt fundamental cellular processes. Such aberrant functioning by abnormal proto-oncogenes may play crucial and even causative roles in cancer development. Altered proto-oncogenes have been identified in cancers of the human urogenital tract. Studies on the expression of proto-oncogenes in genitourinary cells will increase understanding of basic biological properties of these cells, and may yield information relevant to staging, diagnosis, risk factors, and markers of pathologic classification.\r"

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed in 16 prisoners, all of whom were IVDA, and four nonprisoner IVDA. The observed number of prisoners with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (11) diagnosed between January 1, 1981 and December 12, 1984, significantly greater than the expected number (2.28) based on age adjusted incidence rates for the US population (P less than 0.001). The calculated average incidence rate for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among New York State prisoners aged 20 to 49 years was 21.5/10(5) to 67.2/10(5), which was nearly sixfold to 18-fold higher than the general population. For prisoner IVDA, specifically, this incidence may be as high as 164/10(5), which represents a 40-fold increase in the relative risk compared with the general population.

Fifty-seven of the 124 patients were treated with irradiation to the mediastinum as well as to an infradiaphragmatic field. One patient received supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy only. The remaining patients had radiation treatment limited to the infradiaphragmatic field only. Median dose to the mediastinum among the 58 patients was 2400 cGy. Four patients developed heart disease (one fatal myocardial infarction, one uncomplicated myocardial infarction, one constrictive pericarditis resulting in permanent total body anasarca, and one patient requiring aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting for atherosclerotic disease) and two died suddenly. The two sudden deaths were thought to be cardiac in origin by the patient's primary physicians. All six complications occurred in the group that received mediastinal irradiation. No cardiac disease was manifested in the group not treated with mediastinal irradiation. This difference in the incidence of cardiac disease between the two groups is statistically significant (two sided, P = 0.019). Neither group had a statistically significant difference in cardiac disease rate from a normal population (Framingham study), although the ratio of observed to expected cardiac disease was 1.97 in the group receiving mediastinal radiation. Further experience from this and other institutions is necessary to confirm this finding.\r"

Analysis of progression-free survival at 24 months revealed that amplification of N-myc was associated with the worst prognosis (P less than 0.001). In the untreated group, no amplification of N-myc was detected in any of two ganglioneuromas and four ganglioneuroblastomas, whereas amplification of N-myc was observed in all two round-cell and six of 20 rosette fibrillary neuroblastomas. On the other hand, the authors detected amplification of N-myc in three of eight less differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas in the treated group and observed the worst prognosis in these three patients. The total percentage of the cases from both untreated and treated groups suggest that amplification of N-myc may occur more frequently in undifferentiated types of neuroblastomas than in less malignant types. In conclusion, the amplification of N-myc in neuroblastomas was closely associated with the worst prognosis, which was suggested by both disease stage and histologic characteristics.\r"

In 13 neuroendocrine (NE) tumors (nine small cell lung carcinoma [SCLC], three atypical NE tumors, and one carcinoid tumor), the NE differentiation was assessed by ultrastructural determination of neurosecretory granule (NSG) density. Twelve non-NE lung tumors also were studied (three adenocarcinomas, four epidermoid, two composite, two large cell undifferentiated carcinomas, and one lymphoma). Four normal lung tissues and 1 human brain were used as controls. The gamma gamma isoenzyme was present at a high level (mean +/- SE, 12 +/- 3%) in all NE carcinomas and consistently absent in all non-NE tumors as well as in normal lung. The alpha gamma isoenzyme was found in significantly higher proportion in NE carcinomas (mean +/- SE, 29 +/- 2%) than in non-NE tumors (mean +/- SE, 8 +/- 1%) (P less than 0.0001), despite an equally high level of total enolase activity in both groups of tumor. The separation of alpha gamma and gamma gamma isoenzymes of enolase allows for the accurate diagnosis of NE tumors and NE components of atypical NE carcinomas, and the gamma gamma isoenzyme, in contrast to gamma chain detection by immunoassay, can be considered to be a specific marker in itself of NE differentiation in lung neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "Flow cytometrically determined cellular DNA content has been measured on specimens from 101 patients affected by lung cancer (40 epidermoid cell carcinoma, 22 adenocarcinoma, 21 large cell carcinoma, 11 small cell carcinoma, and seven undifferentiated carcinoma), and one by mesothelioma. Ninety-eight of 102 (96%) patients with neoplastic disease evidenced the occurrence of at least one cytometrically aneuploid cell subpopulation. Fifty-five of 102 (54%) cases evidenced the occurrence of multiclonality, that is, the presence of more than one aneuploid stem cell line. However, the incidence of multiclonality in lung carcinoma was statistically different in surgical cases (where multiple site sampling from the primary and lymph nodes was possible) in comparison to the nonsurgical ones (e.g., bronchial washing): 48/77 (62%) and six of 24 (25%), respectively. Therefore, only the 77 surgical patients were used for further analysis. The cases were classified according to the DNA index (DI) in the following way: Group A (tumors with one or more stem lines with DI ranging from 1 to 2) and Group B (tumors with at least one stem line with DI less than 1 or greater than 2). A significant correlation has been found between the cytometric ploidy condition so defined (Groups A and B) and the tumor mass doubling time (DT), Group B being associated with fast growing tumors (DT lower than 90 days). A statistically better 12-month survival rate (5-year maximum follow-up) was observed in Group A (88%) in respect to Group B (47%) and is evident in the patient survival time course. A better prognostic indication can be achieved by stratifying the patients according to both the cytometric ploidy condition and the tumor DT. Flow cytometric data can usefully contribute to the prognostic assessment of lung carcinoma provided that representative cellular material is collected by multiple site sampling.\r"

By using carefully defined anatomic criteria, various substages of tumor spread have been examined prospectively for their prognostic significance in a group of 1117 patients accessioned over 14 years and documented by the same pathologist. Spread from the muscularis propria into surrounding tissues was not associated with a significant deterioration in prognosis if the lines of resection were clear of tumor and there were no known metastases or free mesothelial surface invasion. Free mesothelial surface invasion by potentially curable tumors was associated with a significant reduction in patient survival. Patients with potentially curable tumors but with lymph node metastases had a significantly poorer probability of survival if the apical lymph node was involved. Among those with incurable tumors, there was no significant difference in survival depending on whether incurability was due to distant metastases or surgical transection of tumor. Substaging offers a means of refining the ability to predict tumor behavior.\r"

One of the two also had a markedly elevated anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) EBV titer. The two lymphoma patients were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical, but two unaffected siblings shared the same HLA haplotypes. One of the lymphoma patients and four unaffected family members were anergic; and three unaffected family members had a decreased percentage of T-cells.

One hundred three patients (60%) received transfusions within 1 month of surgery and 37 patients (22%) developed recurrent cancer. No overall relationship between transfusion status (yes or no) and tumor recurrence or patient survival was found, although among subsets of patients (those with colon cancer or Dukes' Stage C2 disease), patients who had received transfusions were less likely to develop recurrent cancer than patients who had not (P = 0.01). No effect of transfusion on patient survival was found, even after consideration of potential confounding variables. The conflicting data regarding blood transfusion and cancer recurrence are reviewed, but it would appear to be premature to alter radically current blood transfusion practices based on the possibility that transfusion may adversely influence the risk of cancer recurrence.\r"

Eight patients with a residual tumor after radiotherapy underwent a modified radical mastectomy.

The effect of 17 factors on overall survival or disease-free survival was analyzed. With univariate analysis, eight factors were found to affect overall survival or disease-free survival: extent of initial erythema, size of initial edema, lymph node involvement, erythema present at the end of initial chemotherapy, erythema present at the end of radiotherapy, tumor size at the end of induction chemotherapy, residual breast tumor at the end of maintenance chemotherapy, and performance of a radical mastectomy. Age at diagnosis, menopausal status, type of chemotherapy, and date of appearance of inflammatory signs did not influence prognosis. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model isolated three bad prognosis factors: erythema involving the whole breast at initial diagnosis, erythema present at the end of initial chemotherapy, and lymph node involvement.\r"

In these 19 patients, absolute neutrophilia was detected in 13, eosinophilia was present in three, and eleven exhibited concomitant thrombocytosis. Tumor-associated leukocytosis occurred predominantly, and eosinophilia exclusively, in patients with large cell pulmonary neoplasms. These results suggest an unusual myeloproliferative stimulus in this type of cancer. It may result from tumor cell production of hemopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activity; however, additional studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism(s), and to determine whether this is a peculiar characteristic of the cells that comprise large cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung.\r"

Men had higher proportions of intestinal-type carcinoma than women. The intestinal-diffuse carcinoma ratio increased progressively with age. Although the relative intestinal-diffuse carcinoma ratios in women appeared to reflect the relative incidence rates of stomach cancer of the different ethnic and dialect groups, the ratios in men were inconsistent. Indian men had a higher intestinal-diffuse carcinoma ratio than Chinese men despite a lower incidence of stomach cancer. Hokkien men had the highest incidence of stomach cancer and the lowest intestinal-diffuse carcinoma ratio among the Chinese dialect groups. The use of the ratio as an indicator of relative risks for gastric cancer between populations of different genetic makeup is inconsistent and unreliable.\r"

(table; see text) Stroke volume by RV ANGIO correlated with Fick (n = 10, r = .86) and thermodilution stroke volume (n = 21, r = .88). It is concluded that although the thermodilution method is an accurate way to measure flow, it is not an accurate way to measure right ventricular ejection fraction, and by inference, ventricular volumes. The most likely explanation for this finding is incomplete mixing as in previous studies of indicator methods of measuring left ventricular volumes.\r"

In 149 out of 153 consecutive procedures, where the number of associated major complications was less than 1%, King's bioptome and a specially designed radiopaque long introducer catheter were used. The rather thickwalled sheath had a conical tip which facilitated percutaneous entry and a preshaped distal bending which was particularly useful in the right ventricle for obtaining a steady and safe position in the direction of the interventricular septum. With respect to the histopathological information from an average of 4.2 biopsies per patient, a high clinical yield was gained in 28% of the patients, in the form of specific diagnoses and/or findings influencing subsequent therapy, and useful diagnostic information was gleaned from a further 53%. Thus, the procedure appears safe as a part of routine cardiac catheterization, and biopsy may contribute to a more accurate and clinically relevant classification of a substantial number of patients with suspected myocardial disease.\r"

Their relationship can be characterized by a formula; reaching distance = sin beta X length of the arm. The two clinically most useful multiple angulations--double and triple angles--were evaluated in 54 patients in whom commercial J-wire failed to pass the lesion in 120 s. This value was compared with an average time of 57.90 +/- 3.9 s needed to pass an angled, individually shaped guidewire from the tip of the guiding catheter through the lesion. (P much less than 0.001 or highly significant.) All patients had tortuous vessels, sharply angled branches, and the largest diameter of the stenosed vessel less than 50% of the largest diameter of the left main coronary artery. Thirty-seven lesions were in the obtuse marginal arteries and 17 in the diagonal arteries. The study suggested that angled guidewires shaped according to described guidelines have superior success to commercial, unshaped J-wires in instrumentation of the tortuous vessels with angled branches and markedly varying diameter.\r"

We reviewed our experience with these catheters in our first 100 consecutive cases. All cineangiograms were diagnostic, though 9% were deemed only of fair quality (incomplete luminal filling in some frames) by two experienced observers. Technical problems encountered with the use of these catheters included instability of the right Judkin's catheter in the right coronary ostium owing to high torquability, streaming of contrast during left coronary injections, and difficulty entering the left ventricle with a pig-tail catheter.\r"

To test this hypothesis in vivo, rats were prepared for electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves. Blood pressures and heart rates were monitored, and the animals were treated with alpha-agonists and alpha-antagonists. The alpha 1-selective agonist phenylephrine significantly attenuated vagally induced bradycardia in a dose-dependent fashion (ED50 = 19 micrograms/kg). This is consistent with the hypothesis that there is alpha-adrenergic inhibition of ACh release. In contrast, the alpha 2-selective agonist, BHT-920, caused no change in heart rate during vagal stimulation. The effects of phenylephrine to raise heart rate and blood pressure during vagal stimulation were blocked by the alpha 1-selective antagonist prazosin (ID50 approximately 1 microgram/kg) but not by the alpha 2-selective antagonists yohimbine and rauwolscine. This further supports an alpha 1 assignment to the prejunctional adrenergic receptor mechanism, which can regulate the release of acetylcholine from cardiac parasympathetic neurons.\r"

Phosphonic acids have been suggested as useful 31P-NMR extracellular markers. The present study was designed to assess the utility of phenylphosphonic acid (PPA) as a 31P-NMR extracellular marker in perfused smooth muscle. Rabbit bladder strips were exposed to PPA concentrations of 1-20 mM. Tension development in response to maximal carbachol challenges (10 microM) was independent of PPA concentration. Addition of PPA (6 mM) to the perfusate supplying the isolated resting rabbit bladder had no effect on 31P-NMR-detectable phosphatic compounds. PPA's resonance frequency was distinctly downfield from endogenous phosphates and demonstrated a pH-dependent chemical shift of +/- 1.12 ppm/pH unit over the range of 6.4 to 7.6 with a pK' of 7.09 at 23 degrees C. The time courses for washing PPA in and out of the resting bladder were best described by monotonic exponential growth (r = 0.972; n = 3) and decay (r = 0.972; n = 3) equations, respectively. Rate and time constants for PPA wash-in (0.039 +/- 0.004 min-1 and 25.7 +/- 2.3 minutes) and washout (0.038 +/- 0.000 min-1 and 26.3 +/- 0.0 minutes) were not significantly different. Using steady state PPA and ATP peak intensities and concentrations, an extracellular-to-intracellular ratio was calculated to be 0.31 +/- 0.03 (n = 3). These data indicate that PPA remains distributed exclusively in the extracellular spaces.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ventricular components that vary their morphology and morphometry in a hypertrophic state are the muscle cells, connective tissue elements, vasculature, or a combination of some or all of the above. Morphologic quantification of the progressive tissue changes occurring throughout the natural life span of the spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats has not been thoroughly documented. Using perfused-fixed tissue from both strains at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age, we have determined the morphometric changes that occurred in the subepicardial and midwall regions of the left ventricle. Myocyte cell size, wall thickness, and arterial blood pressure were elevated in 1-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats, reached significance by 6 months, and remained significantly greater throughout the 24 months examined. Tissue morphometry demonstrated significant tissue component volumetric differences at 6 months in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Age-related morphometric tissue changes occurred in both strains yet were exacerbated (percent volume of myocytes) or diminished (percent volume interstitial space) in the mature and aging spontaneously hypertensive rat. Capillary density of SHR left ventricle showed a drastic decline so that 6-month-old SHR had the same density as a senescent Wistar-Kyoto. Tissue morphometry and capillary density data strongly support the hypothesis that tissue oxygenation is diminished in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, and as a result, tissue necrosis and myocyte cell death occur.\r"

Ryanodine (10(-10)-10(-5) M) irreversibly decreased contraction amplitude by 10-70% relative to control in a concentration-dependent manner with minimal effects on electrical activity. Ryanodine caused a slight decrease in rapid 45Ca uptake, but no change in total exchangeable calcium content or rapid 45Ca efflux. Caffeine (1-20 mM) caused a transient (less than 10 seconds) 5-12% increase in contraction amplitude followed by a sustained 9-76% decrease in contraction amplitude and a 10 mV decrease in diastolic membrane voltage. Caffeine caused a decrease in rapid 45Ca uptake, a decrease in total exchangeable calcium content, and an increase in rapid 45Ca efflux. These results suggest that caffeine produces a decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ uptake, and/or an increase in SR Ca2+ release that eventually depletes the SR of Ca2+, presumably accounting for the negative inotropic effect. The ryanodine effects on contraction are more difficult to account for solely in terms of alterations of transsarcolemmal Ca2+ fluxes and Ca2+ contents. Our data indicate an important role for the SR in excitation-contraction coupling in cultured chick embryo ventricular cells and suggest that SR Ca2+ is part of the rapidly exchanging Ca2+ compartment noted in 45Ca flux studies.\r"

  ".U": "87244712\r", 
  ".W": "Positron emission tomography is a unique noninvasive imaging technique that provides cross-sectional images of radiotracer concentrations in myocardium and permits measurement of blood flow as well as metabolism. Ammonia and glutamate have been labeled with the positron-emitter 13N (half-life 10 minutes) for use with positron emission tomography as tracers of flow and metabolism, respectively. In order to characterize the fate of these 13N-labelled compounds in myocardium, isolated rabbit interventricular septa were used to study the kinetics of [13N] glutamate ([13N]glu) and 13NH3 under aerobic and anoxic conditions. Tissue analyses 6 minutes after injection of a [13N]glu bolus into myocardium revealed that 70% of the 13N-label was present in [13N]glu 12%, 11%, and 4% in [13N]alanine ([13N]ala), [13N]aspartate ([13N]asp), and [13N]glutamine ([13N]gln), respectively. The corresponding relative specific activities were 1.0:0.4:0.5:0.01. Anoxia resulted in a significant increase in [13N]ala with a reduction in [13N]glu. This was consistent with increased pyruvate production due to increased anaerobic glycolysis and transamination of pyruvate with [13N]glu to yield [13N]ala. In support of this, addition of 2 mM pyruvate to the perfusate under control conditions produced a tissue distribution of 13N similar to that with anoxia. Six minutes after a bolus of 13NH3 during both control and anoxic conditions, 60% of the tissue 13N-label was in [13N]gln with no detectable amounts in other amino acids. The rest of the 13N-label was in 13NH3. Time-activity curve analyses demonstrated that anoxia significantly reduced the tissue retention of 13N-label from 13NH3 but not from [13N]glu. Thus, 13N from 13NH3 and [13N]glu was retained in tissue by different mechanisms involving glutamate, which were affected differentially by anoxia. These results suggest that positron emission tomography imaging with 13NH3 and [13N]glu in combination may be useful in identifying ischemic myocardium.\r"

Test pulses to negative potentials from holding potentials of -90 to -40 mV elicited currents that inactivated quickly and in a voltage-dependent manner (called I low for low threshold). A second calcium current persisted even at relatively positive holding potentials of -30 to -10 mV, required stronger depolarizations for maximum current, and inactivated slowly (I high for high threshold). I high transported barium more than calcium, whereas I low transported the two ions equally. Single-channel current records (90 mM barium) showed a larger conductance that activated at relatively positive potentials and a smaller (about one-third) conductance that activated at weak depolarizations. Nitrendipine suppressed I high, and the effect was voltage dependent as observed in cardiac cells, although block of resting channels was much greater in vein cells (KR approximately 10(-8) M). Exposure to the stereoisomer (-)Bay K 8644 increased I high but not I low. The (-)Bay K 8644 also increased the channel activity and prolonged the open time of the larger conductance current. Thus, two types of calcium channels, differing in potential-dependence of activation and inactivation, calcium/barium selectivity, single-channel conductance, and sensitivities to dihydropyridines were identified in smooth muscle cells isolated from a large cutaneous vein.\r"

The beta-receptor subtype specificity and the effect of adenylate cyclase activation were determined. Potassium concentrations were continuously recorded by PVC-valinomycin minielectrodes in the left atrial cavity and in coronary sinus blood diverted through a shunt to the right atrium. The difference in potassium concentration between the left atrial cavity and coronary sinus, and the accumulated myocardial potassium uptake were calculated after computerized data sampling. By intracoronary drug infusion, changes in heart rate and systemic effects were minimized. Isoproterenol (0.6-0.8 microgram/min), a nonspecific beta-agonist, reduced coronary sinus potassium concentration transiently to a nadir of 0.28 (0.15-0.43) mM (median and 95% confidence interval) below control values (n = 12). The potassium uptake, which amounted to 140 (79-202) mumol/100 g tissue, corresponding to an intracellular potassium increase of about 3 mM, was abolished after selective beta 1-blockade by pafenolol. The specific beta 1-agonist dobutamine (40 micrograms/min) caused a similar potassium uptake before and after selective beta 2-blockade by ICI 118, 551. Salbutamol (2 micrograms/min), a specific beta 2-agonist, induced a minor potassium uptake of 4 (1-20) mumol/100 g, blocked by pafenolol. After nonselective beta-blockade by propranolol the adenylate cyclase stimulator forskolin caused a myocardial potassium uptake of similar magnitude to that of isoproterenol before beta-blockade. We conclude that a myocardial potassium uptake ensues during beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation and adenylate cyclase activation.\r"

In control hearts from rabbits fed normal chow, perfusion pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, maximum +dP/dt, and the rate of intravascular clearance of radiolabelled albumin remained constant during 5 hours of continuous perfusion, while the mean transit time of radiolabelled albumin increased 1.6 X baseline. In ischemic hearts from rabbits fed normal chow, perfusion pressure increased 59% during reperfusion while left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and maximum +dP/dt returned toward control levels. The rate of intravascular clearance of radiolabelled albumin decreased 36%, and the mean transit time of albumin increased approximately 3 X baseline. Ischemia-reperfusion injury to the cardiac vasculature and musculature was markedly increased in hearts of rabbits fed chow supplemented with 2% cholesterol for 2-3 weeks compared to rabbits fed the same diet for a longer duration (5-16 weeks) or rabbits fed normal chow. Prior to ischemia, permeation of the coronary vasculature by albumin was increased twofold in rabbits fed cholesterol for 2-3 weeks while myocyte contractile function was normal relative to chow-fed controls or the group fed cholesterol for 5-16 weeks. These effects of acute cholesterol feeding precede occlusive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and occur at plasma cholesterol concentrations one third of those in rabbits fed cholesterol for the longer duration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During an investigation of the effect of ryanodine on contractions in cardiac muscle, it was found that long rest periods removed all or most of the drug's effect. Therefore, we studied the kinetics of block development and recovery from block produced by low concentrations of ryanodine (1-100 pM) on the postrest contractions of ferret papillary muscle. At 100 pM, ryanodine depressed steady-state contraction amplitude slightly (4.2 +/- 1.1% mean +/- SEM, n = 10) but strongly inhibited (40-80%) the first contraction (postrest contraction) elicited on restimulation of the preparation after rest periods of 1 second to 5 minutes. Under control conditions, the nearly maximal potentiation of the twitch occurring after a standard test rest period (30 seconds of rest) was not affected by a preceding conditioning rest of up to 20 minutes. In the presence of 100 pM ryanodine, a conditioning rest increased the amplitude of the twitch elicited after a test rest, and the test rest contraction recovered toward control (drug-free) amplitude monoexponentially (time constant, 582 +/- 105 seconds). Block of postrest contraction could be reinduced by stimulation and occurred faster when higher rates were used (time constants, 758 seconds at 1 Hz and 107 +/- 26 seconds at 3 Hz). Since rest potentiation of twitch tension is believed to be mostly dependent on extra calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the results suggest that the ryanodine-induced blockade of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is use-dependent and recovers during diastole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of adrenergic receptors in specific components of the heart such as vessels and myocytes cannot be determined easily with assays of membranes prepared from homogenates of whole tissue. Accordingly, we characterized the binding of the potent nonsubtype selective antagonist [125iodo]cyanopindolol to beta-receptors in unfixed transmural slices of feline and canine left ventricle. Specific binding ratios greater than 90% were achieved at radioligand concentrations near Kd and greater than 80% at saturating ligand concentrations. Binding of radioligand to receptors in transmural slices was rapid, saturable, stereoselective, and displaceable by antagonists and agonists with the rank order of potency expected of beta-adrenergic receptors. Analysis of binding isotherms indicated maximum binding capacities of 27.8 +/- 6.6 and 40.6 +/- 5.1 fmol/mg tissue protein and dissociation constants of 10.1 +/- 1.8 and 21.3 +/- 1.6 pM in feline and canine ventricular slices, respectively. The distribution of beta-receptors in myocytes and selected vascular components of the heart was determined with quantitative film autoradiography and high resolution computer-based analysis and display of the density of binding sites, maximum binding capacity, and binding affinity measurements. The results of autoradiographic analysis revealed a uniform transmural distribution of receptors in regions composed primarily of ventricular myocytes but an inverse relation between the density of beta-receptors and the diameter of coronary vessels. Large epicardial conductance arteries had half the receptor density of subjacent myocytes; small mural arteries had approximately 60% of the beta-receptor density of nearby myocytes, and the coronary resistance arterioles had the highest receptor density of any vascular compartment, which was equivalent to that of myocytes. The methods developed should be of particular value in characterizing the distribution and function of receptor subtypes and mechanisms of regulation of adrenergic responsiveness in intact myocardium.\r"

This process occurs at specific junctional sites distributed over the endocardial surface of both ventricles. At these junctional sites, action potentials can be recorded from cells that appear to be interposed between the Purkinje cells and the ventricular muscle cells. The action potential upstrokes recorded from these \"transitional\" cells have characteristic double phases produced by electrotonic interactions with the Purkinje cells and the ventricular muscle cells. We have shown that these junctional regions in the canine subendocardium appear to be fixed anatomic sites with locations independent of the activation sequence of the Purkinje network. In addition, the activation delay between the Purkinje cells and the ventricular muscle cells at a junctional site and the patterns of the action potential upstrokes of transitional cells at a junctional site are independent of the activation sequence of the Purkinje network. We have also demonstrated that at some locations there are multiple Purkinje activation signals recorded with a surface electrode and that these multiple activation signals represent discrete groups of Purkinje cells, some of which contribute to the junctional process while others appear to be substantially uncoupled from neighboring Purkinje cell groups and the underlying transitional cells.\r"

Exposure of cells in a medium containing 1 mM CaCl2 to rotenone and uncoupler resulted in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion from 17.08 +/- 2.26 to 0.63 +/- 0.11 nmol/mg within 8 minutes, and the cells went into contracture. In this time, the cells lost 1.65 +/- 0.1 nmol Ca/mg of total rapidly exchangeable cellular calcium, and the level of free cytosolic calcium as measured by indo1 rose from 47.4 +/- 16.3 nM to 79.8 +/- 27.6 nM. The subsequent rate of rise of intracellular free calcium concentration was just 4 nM/min for at least 40 minutes. Therefore, we investigated the effect of ATP depletion on the rate of calcium entry. In cells loaded with sodium by ouabain treatment without calcium, the initial rate of calcium influx on calcium addition was inhibited by 82-84% when cellular ATP was depleted, as measured by 45Ca or indo1. Quin2 also showed a strong inhibition of calcium influx by ATP depletion, but itself also caused a strong inhibition of calcium influx. The rate of calcium influx declined even further in ATP-depleted cells after the initial influx: Between 1 and 12 minutes after calcium addition, the residual 45Ca uptake rate of the first minute was inhibited by an additional 90%. We conclude that ATP depletion per se does not quickly elevate cytoplasmic free calcium and that such an elevation is prevented by a very strong inhibition of the rate of calcium entry.\r"

The purification procedure involves sequential DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography, calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography using a Spherogel TSK DEAE 5PW column. By SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified cardiac phosphatase consists of two subunits of Mr 61,000 and 19,000, similar to the brain enzyme, calcineurin. Protein phosphatase activity of the cardiac enzyme is stimulated by Ca2+-calmodulin and inhibited by the calmodulin antagonist drug, calmidazolium. Effects of a series of divalent cations on catalytic activity of the cardiac calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase are similar to those observed with calcineurin, when the two enzymes are assayed under identical conditions. Highly enriched preparations of bovine cardiac sarcolemma contain substrates of cAMP-dependent protein kinase of Mr 166 K, 133 K, 108 K, 79 K, 39 K, and 14 K, which are specifically dephosphorylated by the calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase with pseudofirst-order rate constants of 0.23, 0.46, 0.69, 0.35, 0.69, and 0.115 min-1, respectively. These substrates are not present in purified preparations of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. These results support a role of the calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase in the Ca2+-regulation of specific sarcolemmal processes by protein dephosphorylation.\r"

ATECD was investigated in an experimental model in which bovine passage 0 cultured endothelial cells (EC) were incubated with aggregating platelets and autologous plasma in a computer-operated aggregometer-like device. A maximal platelet aggregation required 150 X 10(-6) M adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to be present in ECs. A 5-minute coincubation for ECs and platelets was found to be adequate in evaluating the maximal ATECD value. By increasing the EC number in the aggregation suspension, platelet aggregation was progressively inhibited through a sigmoid curve (50% inhibition of aggregation required 2 X 10(4) EC). Pharmacologic modulations of ATECD by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) + 2-isosorbide mononitrate (2-ISMN) + 5-isosorbide mononitrate (5-ISMN) were investigated under experimental conditions reflecting either an acute nitrate effect (platelet + control ECs + drug + ADP) or a chronic effect (platelet + 5-day nitrate-treated ECs + ADP). Under acute circumstances, ISDN antiplatelet activities were profoundly magnified by ECs. Aggregation was fully arrested with 5 X 10(-5) M ISDN and an EC number of 2 X 10(4), whereas the same ISDN concentration alone induced 30% inhibition of control aggregation. In contrast, there were no significant changes in platelet aggregation whether incubation was done in the presence or absence of 2-ISMN or 5-ISMN, ISDN metabolites. Long-term exposure of ECs to isosorbide nitrates (ISN) resulted in increased acquired EC changes in ATECD. 5-ISMN was a poor antiplatelet agent but was capable of counteracting ISDN effects on ATECD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 51 open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused through an extracorporeal bypass tube from the carotid artery, and adenosine release into the local coronary vein was measured by the radioimmunoassay technique following the reduction of perfusion pressure for 20 minutes under alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenoceptor attenuations. Adenosine and lactate concentrations in the coronary arterial and venous blood sampled from the perfused area were determined, as well as fractional shortening. In the untreated condition, adenosine release was significantly (p less than 0.01) increased from 1.7 +/- 0.8 (SEM) to 8.8 +/- 1.3 nmol/100 g/min, 20 minutes after the onset of hypoperfusion (coronary blood flow: 28 +/- 2 ml/100 g/min) following the initial overshoot release. Neither beta- nor alpha 2-adrenoceptor attenuation affected the increase in adenosine release during hypoperfusion except for the slight attenuation of the overshoot release by beta-attenuation. In contrast, intracoronary infusions of prazosin and phentolamine during coronary hypoperfusion markedly attenuated (p less than 0.01) release of adenosine (1.8 +/- 0.7 nmol/100 g/min at 20 minutes). The extents of decreases in fractional shortening and lactate production were comparable between the untreated and alpha 1-adrenoceptor attenuation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, the time to reach maximum contracture is delayed, and the magnitude of the contracture pressure is reduced. Preischemia myocardial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) values in the hypothyroid rat hearts are similar to those of control, but the rate of decrease in ATP is slower in the hearts of hypothyroid rats. Thus, it appears that in the hypothyroid state the development of ischemic contracture is associated with a slower fall of ATP.\r"

The cells appeared normal morphologically, excluded trypan blue dye, showed normal levels of release of lactate dehydrogenase, and contained normal amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Incubation of cells with iodoacetate (3-5 microM), an inhibitor of glycolytic metabolism, prevented the stimulation of 5-HT uptake but did not impair cellular proliferation. A similar, but less pronounced, effect was produced by 1 mM deoxyglucose. On the other hand, the mitochondrial inhibitors antimycin A, sodium azide, potassium cyanide, and 2,4-dinitrophenol inhibited cellular replication similar to the effect of anoxia but did not alter the stimulation of 5-HT uptake. 5-HT uptake correlated strongly with lactate production by the cells exposed to anoxia (r = 0.98). We conclude that stimulation of 5-HT uptake by prolonged exposure of the endothelial cell to hypoxia/anoxia causes alteration of a membrane function (serotonin transport) of the endothelial cell. This alteration is associated with enhanced glycolytic activity of the cell during exposure to hypoxia. The mechanism for translation of enhanced glycolysis to later stimulation of 5-HT uptake remains to be determined. Endothelial cellular replication is dependent on aerobic metabolism.\r"

Intracoronary infusion of adenosine and its derivatives 5'-N-ethyl-carboxamide-adenosine (NECA), (-)-N6-(R-phenyl-isopropyl)-adenosine (R-PIA), and (+)-N6-(S-phenyl-isopropyl)-adenosine (S-PIA) caused dose-dependent parallel increases in both coronary flow and the coronary efflux of radioactive cAMP with a rank order of potency: NECA greater than R-PIA greater than adenosine greater than S-PIA. In contrast, adenosine receptor stimulation of isolated cardiomyocytes in primary culture decreased the cellular release of cAMP below control levels with a rank order of potency: R-PIA greater than NECA. Under control conditions, coronary efflux of adenosine and cAMP was 34.3 +/- 2.3 and 3.9 +/- 0.8 pmol/min (mean +/- SEM, n = 6), respectively. NECA (12 microM) caused an increase in cardiac cAMP release of 3.8 times and elevated the specific radioactivity of cAMP 5 times to 63.7 +/- 6.0 Ci/mol, a value 11 times greater than the specific radioactivity of tissue ATP. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the coronary endothelium possesses adenosine A2 receptors linked to adenylate cyclase, which are activated in parallel with increases in coronary flow and that cardiomyocyte adenosine receptors are predominantly of the A1 subtype. In addition, the contribution of the coronary endothelium to total cardiac adenosine release was calculated to be 14% using the specific radioactivities of adenosine and cAMP released into the effluent perfusate.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of acute myocardial ischemia on the myocardial elastic modulus has been a matter of controversy. To evaluate this question, diastolic elastic modulus was assessed by finite element analysis of left ventricular geometry using three-dimensional echocardiographic reconstructions and right and left ventricular pressure recordings. Elastic properties were estimated before and after coronary occlusion in 6 open-chest dogs. Elastic modulus values were derived by means of a computer program that determined the global elastic modulus that best predicted the diastolic changes in left ventricular geometry. In the finite element analysis after coronary occlusion, two analyses were performed: one utilizing the control elastic modulus for all segments of the left ventricle and one in which ischemic (dyskinetic) segments were assigned a higher elastic modulus. Results showed that the control elastic modulus was a poor predictor of diastolic left ventricular expansion after coronary occlusion. The finite element analysis in which the ischemic segments were assigned a higher elastic modulus better predicted ischemic diastolic wall motion patterns. Error values (difference between predicted and actual left ventricular segmental diastolic motion) were: control, 1.9 +/- 0.3 mm (mean +/- SD), ischemia, 2.9 +/- 0.5 mm, and 2.2 +/- 0.4 mm using the stiffer elastic modulus for ischemic segments. Error values were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) under ischemic conditions when the control elastic modulus was uniformly applied compared with control and ischemia with dyskinetic segments assigned a higher elastic modulus. From these data, it is concluded that the myocardial diastolic elastic modulus is increased by ischemia and that this approach may allow clinical assessment of intrinsic muscle stiffness.\r"

However, the synthesis rates of alpha-myosin heavy chains in the same hearts were not altered significantly. There was a differential increase in the fractional synthesis rate of beta vs. alpha heavy chains in 2-day and 4-day pressure overload and in 2-day shams, suggesting switching toward beta heavy chain synthesis had occurred at these time points. beta heavy chain synthesis, as a proportion of total (alpha + beta) heavy chain synthesis, was significantly higher in 4-day pressure overload (78 +/- 9%) than in 4-day sham rabbits (63 +/- 6%). This increase in relative beta-synthesis was associated with a significant increase in the relative proportion of beta heavy chain mRNA level (76 +/- 13% vs. 56 +/- 7%).

Pressure-flow data at given volume and time were independent of flow duration, starting volume, and ejected volume for flow-clamp durations exceeding 30 msec. Flow history independent of pressure-flow relations was linear for flow values larger than +/- 5 ml/sec. The time-varying elastance model, E(t), of the ventricle was extended with a resistive component. Transient effects of flow can be explained by including a second elastance. The resulting verified 3-component model is consistent with recent reported experimental findings. The properties of internal resistance correspond to a constant unloaded ejection flow Qmax, which was tested by extrapolating the linear pressure-flow relations to zero pressure. Qmax reached a plateau value of approximately 25 ml/sec within 50 msec after the start of contraction. In relaxation, Qmax is only slightly smaller. Qmax did not depend on volume; therefore, the following equation was adequate for the relation between pressure, p(t); volume, V(t); and flow Q(t), during the flow-clamped ejections from 30 minutes after the start of the flow: (t) = E(t).(V(t)-Vd).(1-Q(t)/Qmax)\r"

Studies were performed during control treadmill exercise, which produced regional myocardial ischemia (blood flow measured with microspheres) and wall dysfunction (measured using sonomicrometers). A second run was performed after the administration of atenolol (0.3-1.0 mg/kg i.v.), and the reduced heart rate caused by atenolol during early steady-state running was then prevented by atrial pacing during the latter portion of the run. Atenolol reduced the exercise heart rate from 217 +/- 25 beats per minute (SD, n = 9) to 166 +/- 15, and ischemic zone wall thickening during systole improved from 27 +/- 22% of the resting value in the control run to 50 +/- 25% of the resting value in the atenolol run (p less than 0.01). Atrial pacing then increased heart rate to 217 +/- 23 beats per minute, and regional wall thickening deteriorated to 15 +/- 25% of the resting value. Regional subendocardial blood flow in the ischemic zone during atrial pacing with atenolol was slightly less than that observed in the control run, in both ischemic and control zones, indicating no remaining beneficial effect of atenolol when heart rate reduction was eliminated. We conclude that the only significant mechanism for the improvement in exercise-induced ischemia and wall motion produced by atenolol is a reduction in the exercise heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test the mechanical behavior of the contractured muscles (at 24 degrees C), the central segment length was sinusoidally oscillated (amplitude 1%) at 15 different frequencies (0.05-30 Hz). The dynamic stiffness of the central segment was calculated from the ratio of force response amplitude to length perturbation amplitude. At low frequencies (below 0.4 Hz), stiffness was approximately constant and reflected the force-length relation. However, in a localized range near 1 Hz, there was a distinct drop in the magnitude of dynamic stiffness to approximately half its low-frequency baseline. This range may reflect the dynamics of attachment and detachment of force generators. The frequency of minimum stiffness was consistent among all muscles (1.3 +/- 0.3 Hz). Moreover, no significant change in this frequency was found over the examined range of lengths (90-100% of the segment length that produced maximal developed force) and activation levels (Ba2+ concentration 0.3-1.0 mM). From 2 to 8 Hz, dynamic stiffness appeared to reflect force-velocity properties, but at higher frequencies, another elastic property emerged. At 30 Hz, stiffness was proportional to force, with an apparent series elasticity less than 1.8%. Even though the muscles had only moderate longitudinal inhomogeneity, quantitatively significant (35%) errors would have been introduced had the study relied on total muscle length instead of central segment length.\r"

This study included muscles from thyrotoxic rabbits and newborn rabbits, rabbit atria, and normal papillary muscles at different temperatures. The usual excitation-contraction coupling process was bypassed by replacing bathing Ca2+ with Ba2+. The ensuring actively maintained contracture allowed us to focus more specifically on the contractile properties of the myofilaments. Dynamic stiffness was determined by sinusoidally oscillating muscle length at many different frequencies over the range 0.05-50 Hz while holding average muscle length at 95% of the systolic length, thus giving maximal developed force. The form of the stiffness modulus spectrum was similar for all muscles studied: stiffness was fairly constant at low frequencies, decreased to a minimum at an intermediate frequency, and then increased steeply, followed by a milder rate of increase over high frequencies. Differences in contraction speed were evident by shifts in the frequencies at which corresponding portions of the stiffness spectrum appeared. The clearest landmark was the frequency where stiffness became minimum (fmin). This varied strongly with temperature (Q10 = 2.9). Compared to normal adult papillary muscles (fmin = 1.2 Hz), fmin was 2.2 times faster in thyrotoxic myocardium, 1.9 times faster in 1-week-old rabbits, and 3.7 times faster in atrial trabeculae. These ratios of functional speed are similar to the corresponding ratios of myosin Ca2+-ATPase activities reported in the literature.\r"

  ".W": "Propagation in cardiac muscle is faster in the longitudinal than in the transverse axis of the cells. Yet, as a result of the larger upstroke velocity of action potentials propagating transversely, it has been suggested that longitudinal propagation is more vulnerable to block. To study the relation between conduction velocity and maximal upstroke velocity (Vmax), as well as the time course of conduction delay and block in the transverse vs. longitudinal direction, thin square pieces of sheep epicardial muscle were superfused with the cellular uncoupler heptanol (1.5 mM). Action potentials were recorded with microelectrodes at opposite corners of the preparation while stimulating alternately in the longitudinal or transverse direction with bipolar electrodes located at contralateral corners. In all cases, block occurred more promptly for transverse than for longitudinal propagation. The decrease in conduction velocity was greater than expected for Vmax decay and, in some cases, Vmax increased while conduction velocity decreased. In the presence of high grade conduction impairment, foot potentials appeared and the upstrokes became \"notched.\" We conclude that when intercellular coupling is impaired, transverse propagation is more vulnerable to block, and need not be dependent on changes in Vmax.\r"

Smooth muscle membrane potential and contractile force were measured simultaneously in isolated pieces of rat tail artery exposed to a range of concentrations of norepinephrine, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, or raised external potassium. Potassium caused depolarization and contraction when the membrane was depolarized beyond -40 mV. Maximum contraction occurred at -19 mV, and further depolarization gave no increase in contraction. Both norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine caused contraction and depolarization, but the relation between depolarization and contraction was not the same as when potassium was used. There was significant contraction when the membrane potential was more negative than -50 mV, and the membrane potential was around -30 mV during maximal contractions. Although they acted on pharmacologically different membrane receptors, the relation between membrane potential and contraction was the same for norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Prazosin reduced the responses to norepinephrine but did not change the relation between membrane potential and contractile force. These results indicated that norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine binding to their respective receptors might activate the same sets of intracellular processes that subsequently caused both depolarization and contraction.\r"

Systolic force-time integral, FTI, also correlates with VO2. In this study, stroke volume was increased from 0 (isovolumic) in isolated cross-circulated canine left ventricle in a stable contractile state while keeping PVA constant with a servo pump. Ventricular total force was calculated from ventricular pressure and volume by the force-equilibrium equation and was integrated from the end of diastole to the end of systole as identified with the time of Emax to yield FTI. Under the conditions of constant PVA, FTI significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased by 10 +/- 7% and 25 +/- 8% with increases in stroke volume from 0 to 8 +/- 4 ml and 17 +/- 3 ml and in ejection fraction from 0 to 0.24 +/- 0.10 and 0.61 +/- 0.05, respectively, while VO2 and Emax remained constant. Therefore, we conclude that in a stable contractile state, it is possible to keep PVA constant even when stroke volume and ejection fraction are varied and that under such conditions, FTI no longer predicts VO2. PVA remains a reliable predictor of VO2 regardless of ventricular loading conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC), the main component of the sarcomere, contains the ATPase activity that generates the contractile force of cardiac and skeletal muscles. The different MHC isoforms are encoded by a closely related multigene family. Most members (seven) of this gene family have been isolated and characterized in the rat, including the alpha- and beta-cardiac, skeletal embryonic, neonatal, fast IIA, fast IIB, and extraocular specific MHC. The slow type I skeletal MHC is encoded by the same gene that codes for the cardiac beta-MHC. Each MHC gene studied displays a pattern of expression that is tissue and developmental stage specific, both in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, more than one MHC gene is expressed in each muscle while each gene is expressed in more than one tissue. The expression of each MHC gene in cardiac and skeletal muscles is modulated by thyroid hormone. Surprisingly, however, the same MHC gene can be regulated by the hormone in a significantly different manner, even in opposite directions, depending on the muscle in which it is expressed. Moreover, the skeletal embryonic and neonatal MHC genes, so far considered specific to these 2 developmental stages, are normally expressed in certain adult muscles and can be reinduced by hypothyroidism in specific muscles. This complex pattern of expression and regulation of the MHC gene family in cardiac and skeletal muscle sheds new light on the mechanisms involved in determining the biochemical basis of the contractile state. It also indicates that the cardiac contractile system needs to be examined in a broader context, including skeletal muscles, in order to understand fully its developmental and physiologic regulation.\r"

Physiologically sequenced contractions were studied in 18 left ventricular papillary muscle preparations (stimulation rate, 12/min). To study the effects of changing loading conditions, only one loading variable (preload, total load, or late load) was changed during each contraction, while the others were held constant. To study the effects of isoproterenol (10(-6) M) and temperature (28 vs. 33 degrees C) on maximum isotonic lengthening rate, preload and late load were held constant and +dL/dt was examined at a common total load. When preload was increased from 0.7 +/- 0.1 to 1.4 +/- 0.1 g/mm2, muscle length increased from 0.98 +/- 0.003 to 1.01 +/- 0.002 muscle lengths, the extent of shortening increased from 0.05 +/- 0.003 to 0.08 +/- 0.003 muscle lengths, but minimum length (0.93 +/- 0.01 muscle lengths) and +dL/dt (1.1 +/- 0.1 muscle lengths/sec) were unchanged.

Late load (the load borne by or applied to the muscle during isotonic lengthening) was altered by changing its magnitude (g/mm2) or time (milliseconds after stimulation) of application. As late load was increased from 1.4 +/- 0.02 to 2.1 +/- 0.3 g/mm2, +dL/dt increased from 1.3 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.3 muscle lengths/sec.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Middle cerebral arteries were cannulated at both ends. Within each cannula was a stimulating electrode. Electrical stimulation (0.5-msec square current pulses at 0.5 Hz yielding 160 microA of current between electrodes) resulted in significant reduction in diameter that was greater at both 40 and 80 mm Hg vs. 100 or 140 mm Hg. Conversely, adventitial stimulation of perivascular nerves with transmural platinum stimulating electrodes resulted in significant vasodilation. The constrictor response to intimal stimulation, as well as the dilatory response to adventitial stimulation, was blocked by tetrodotoxin. The constrictor response to luminal stimulation was enhanced by scorpion toxin demonstrating a functional role for tissues containing fast Na+ channels. Perfusion with collagenase to disrupt the endothelium also abolished the constrictor response to luminal stimulation. The divergence of responses between adventitial and luminal surface stimulation may suggest that different cell layers within a blood vessel serve different functions, one to increase resistance and another to decrease resistance. For example, in cat middle cerebral arteries, the adventitial nerves (i.e., via reflexes) may increase flow, while blood-borne substances may mediate release of agents that reduce flow.\r"

In the equilibrium binding study carried out in sarcolemma-enriched fractions, there were no major differences in the Kd values of these radioligands between coronary artery and aorta. However, the densities of beta-, alpha 1-, and alpha 2-adrenoceptors and [3H]nitrendipine receptors of coronary artery were 258, 12, 12, and 561 fmol/mg protein, respectively, while those of aorta were 37, 525, 1,000, and 215 fmol/mg protein. beta-Adrenergic agonists competed with [3H](-)dihydroalprenolol binding sites in coronary artery, the order of potency being (-)isoproterenol greater than (-)norepinephrine greater than (-)epinephrine greater than (+)isoproterenol. In case of aorta, the order was (-)isoproterenol greater than (-)epinephrine greater than (-)norepinephrine. The competition by (+/-)bisoprolol (beta 1-selective antagonist) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective antagonist) for [125I](-)iodocyanopindolol binding sites in coronary artery resulted in nonlinear Hofstee plots (beta 1:beta 2 = 90%:10%). In case of aorta, linear Hofstee plots were obtained. From these results, we conclude that coronary beta-receptors in pigs are predominantly of beta 1-type, while those of aorta are of beta 2-type; regarding the relative population of adrenoceptors, coronary artery is beta-dominant (beta/alpha = 11), while aorta is alpha-dominant (beta/alpha = 0.02); compared with alpha-adrenoceptors, coronary artery has a greater number of [3H]nitrendipine binding sites (nitrendipine/alpha-adrenoceptor = 23) than aorta (nitrendipine/alpha-adrenoceptor = 0.14).\r"

Seven mongrel dogs were chronically instrumented to measure ascending aortic blood flow (electromagnetic flowmeter); intrapericardial, right atrial, and aortic blood pressures; regional myocardial blood flow (radionuclide labelled microspheres); and myocardial consumption of lactate, pyruvate, and oxygen. Data were collected during progressive cardiac tamponade induced by intrapericardial saline infusion to the point of hemodynamic decompensation. Decompensated cardiac tamponade (DCT) was defined as a decline in mean aortic blood pressure to 70% of the level present when the pericardial space was drained of fluid (baseline) and was produced in all animals within 25 minutes. Cardiac tamponade caused a continuous decline in coronary artery blood flow from 1.26 +/- 0.35 (baseline, mean +/- SD) to 0.53 +/- 0.15 ml/min/g (DCT, p less than 0.01), which was associated with a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption from 1.26 +/- 0.35 (baseline) to 0.74 +/- 0.27 ml/min/g (DCT, p less than 0.05) and a slight increase in myocardial oxygen extraction from 71 +/- 3 (baseline) to 81 +/- 4% (DCT, p less than 0.05). This change in oxygen extraction occurred because of both an increase in arterial and a decrease in coronary venous oxygen content. At all degrees of cardiac tamponade, the lactate-pyruvate ratio did not change significantly from baseline (7.56 +/- 2.31), there was no evidence of lactate production, and the normal endocardial to epicardial blood flow ratio present at baseline (1.41 +/- 0.23) was preserved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although prolonged functional abnormalities after transient myocardial ischemia have been well described, the interrelationship between postischemic systolic and diastolic alterations remains controversial. Therefore, 24 chronically instrumented conscious dogs were studied with left ventricular and pleural micromanometers, ultrasonic dimension transducers in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary distribution, and vena caval and coronary artery occluders. The LAD was occluded for 15 minutes and reperfused for 24 hours while vena caval occlusions were performed at intervals to measure myocardial segment length at 0 mm Hg transmural diastolic left ventricular pressure (L0). Coronary occlusion produced an immediate fall in systolic function as assessed by ejection shortening and stroke work and also induced a 16 +/- 4% increase in L0, which was termed diastolic creep. Throughout reperfusion, reversal of diastolic abnormalities correlated strongly with recovery of segmental shortening and stroke work (p less than 0.001). Correlation between systolic dysfunction and diastolic creep was also observed during alteration of inotropic state by dopamine, during initial reperfusion hyperfunction, and during pharmacologic manipulation of afterload. In 5 additional dog hearts fixed in diastole by rapid glutaraldehyde infusion after coronary occlusion, myocardial creep measured by the segment length transducers paralleled sarcomere elongation measured by electron microscopy. Thus, the direct correlation between diastolic creep and systolic dysfunction throughout reperfusion and during hemodynamic alterations suggests that diastolic properties of postischemic myocardium may not be entirely passive and that systolic and diastolic dysfunction induced by ischemia may have a common basis at the cellular level.\r"

  ".W": "Microvascular reactions to increases in intravascular pressure were studied in the cremaster muscle of the anesthetized rat by enclosing the animal in an airtight box with the muscle exteriorized for observation of the microcirculation. Since the cremaster was exposed to atmospheric pressure, increasing pressure within the box produced equal increases in arterial and venous pressures. Thus, intravascular pressure was altered without affecting the pressure gradient for blood flow. Raising box pressure had no effect on respiration or heart rate and did not change the systemic activity of the sympathetic system, angiotensin II, or vasopressin. Diameters and flows were measured for first (107 +/- 3 micron, mean +/- SEM), second (87 +/- 5), third (29 +/- 2), and fourth (15 +/- 2) order arterioles during increases in intravascular pressure of +10, +20, and +30 mm Hg. No significant changes in the diameters of first or second order arterioles were elicited when pressure was increased. However, when box pressure was increased to +10, +20, or +30 mm Hg, a sustained constriction occurred in third (29%, 45%, and 63%, respectively) and fourth (5%, 38%, and 57%, respectively) order arterioles. Blood flow was significantly reduced in all arterioles, and perivascular PO2 was decreased adjacent to third and fourth order arterioles. Furthermore, the third order arteriole constrictor response was not abolished by local alpha-receptor blockade (phentolamine), indicating that it was not mediated by a local sympathetic axon reflex. Collectively, these data indicate that a potent, non-neural, pressure-dependent mechanism for vasoregulation is present in small arterioles of the cremaster. The sustained constriction in the presence of reduced blood flow and reduced periarteriolar oxygen tension indicates that the vascular response is independent of and capable of overriding flow-dependent (i.e., metabolic) control in resting skeletal muscle. The observations are compatible with the operation of a powerful myogenic mechanism in small arterioles.\r"
