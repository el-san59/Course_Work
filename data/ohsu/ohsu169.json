Voluntary exercise of the hand muscles was performed at different hand temperatures, both before and after treatment with tocainide. All patients developed stiffness, prolonged weakness, and small compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) following exercise; the temperature at which this occurred was individually different. Two patients with PC and associated episodes of generalized weakness underwent potassium loading. A prolonged exercise test was performed both immediately before and 90 minutes after K-loading. Exercise-induced weakness and CMAP-decline occurred only with high serum K levels. Thiazide treatment in these two patients was ineffective. All seven patients responded well to tocainide. Treatment response and side effects were dose-dependent. Good clinical improvement has been maintained in all patients for more than 6 months, with relatively small doses of tocainide (400-1200 mg/day).\r"

  ".U": "87144568\r", 
  ".W": "During the search for genes coding for the mouse alpha and beta subunits of the antigen-specific receptor of mouse T cells we encountered a third gene, subsequently designated gamma. This gene has many properties in common with the alpha and beta genes, somatic assembly from gene segments that resemble the gene segments for immunoglobulin variable (V), joining (J) and constant (C) regions; rearrangement and expression in T cells and not in B cells; low but distinct sequence homology to immunoglobulin V, J and C regions; other sequences that are reminiscent of the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic regions of integral membrane proteins; and a cysteine residue at the position expected for a disulphide bond linking two subunits of a dimeric membrane protein. Despite these similarities the gamma gene also shows some interesting unique features. These include a relatively limited repertoire of the germ-line gene segments, more pronounced expression at the RNA level in immature T cells such as fetal thymocytes and an apparent absence of in-frame RNA in some functional, alpha beta heterodimer-bearing T cells or cultured T clones and hybridomas. To understand the function of the putative gamma protein it is essential to define the cell population that expresses this protein. To this end we produced a fusion protein composed of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase and the gamma-chain (hereafter referred to a beta-gal-gamma) using the phage expression vector lambda gt11 and raised rabbit antisera against the gamma determinants. Using the purified anti-gamma antibody we detected a polypeptide chain of relative molecular mass 35,000 (Mr 35K) on the surface of 16-day old fetal thymocytes. The gamma-chain is linked by a disulphide bridge to another component of 45K. No such heterodimer was detected on the surface of a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone 2C from which an in-phase gamma cDNA clone was originally isolated.\r"

It was found that a fraction of these clones express CD3 proteins but not the monomorphic Ti alpha beta determinant recognized by WT31 antibody. One interleukin-2-dependent CD3+ WT31- clone, termed F6C7, was used for immunization of mice to generate monoclonal antibodies directed at a potentially novel recognition receptor. It was shown that F6C7 cells, which transcribe Ti beta but not Ti alpha genes, surface-express a clonotypic structure, termed NKFi. Immunoprecipitations performed with anti-NKFi monoclonal antibody (mAb) indicated that the corresponding molecule is resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as a single band of relative molecular mass approximately 85,000 (Mr approximately 85K). After reduction, a major band was detected at 44K and a faint band was present at 41K. The present study was designed to characterize this structure. It was found that NKFi represents either two 44K disulphide-linked gamma (TCR) chains, or possibly one gamma chain associated to an additional undetected molecule, and that the 41K material corresponds to a partially glycosylated fraction of the gamma protein. Anti-NKFi mAb both induces a specific autocrine proliferative response and blocks cytotoxic function, demonstrating that gamma chains serve as functional receptor structures on subpopulations of normal human lymphocytes.\r"

It is generally thought that a single enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum, PtdIns synthase (CDP-diglyceride:myoinositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase, EC 2.7.8.11), is responsible for PtdIns synthesis and that newly synthesized PtdIns is transported to the plasma membrane by exchange proteins. Several investigators have proposed that there are two functionally distinct pools of PtdIns, one responsive to stimulation and the other not, and that the stimulus-responsive pool may be synthesized at a different site within the cell, perhaps within the plasma membrane. Indeed, it was suggested that there is PtdIns synthase activity in plasma membrane isolated from rat liver. GH3 rat pituitary tumour cells are an excellent model system to study stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Conversion of PtdIns to polyphosphoinositides and TRH (and GTP)-activated phosphoinositide hydrolysis are known to occur in plasma membrane isolated from GH3 cells. Here we report that PtdIns synthase activity in the plasma membrane of GH3 cells is distinct from that present in the endoplasmic reticulum. The plasma membrane PtdIns synthase may be responsible for a portion of PtdIns re-synthesis that occurs during cell stimulation.\r"

Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase mediates the action of noradrenaline on the Ca2+ current of cardiac muscle cells. Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase mediates the serotonin-induced modulation of the Ca2+ current in identified snail neurons. The Ca2+/diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) has also been found to regulate Ca2+ currents of neurons. However, no neurotransmitter has yet been shown to regulate Ca2+ current through the activation of protein kinase C. We now report that cholecystokinin, a widely occurring neuropeptide which is present in molluscan neuron, modulates the Ca2+ current in identified neurons of the snail Helix aspersa, and that this effect appears to be mediated by protein kinase C. Specifically, sulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide 26-33 (CCK8), activators of protein kinase C, and intracellular injection of protein kinase C, all shorten the Ca2+-dependent action potential and decrease the amplitude of the Ca2+ current in these cells. All these effects are not reversible within the duration of the experiments. Moreover, intracellular injections of low concentrations of protein kinase C, which are ineffective by themselves, enhance the effectiveness of low concentrations of CCK8 on the Ca2+ current.\r"

It has three subunits, each with a different architecture and function: TnC binds Ca2+; TnI binds to actin and inhibits contraction; and TnT binds one complex to each tropomyosin molecule. The troponin complex has an elongated shape with TnC and TnI forming a globular 'head' region and TnT a long (approximately 160 A) 'tail'. TnT binds to two widely separated regions of tropomyosin: the head region of the complex is near Cys 190 of tropomyosin and the tail region is near the overlapping joint that links the tropomyosin molecules into filaments. Here we report the X-ray structure determination at 17 A resolution of glutaraldehyde-treated tropomyosin crystals in which native troponin complex or fragments of TnT have been bound. Our results show that the amino-terminal tail end of TnT spans the head-to-tail joint of the tropomyosin filaments, and that the 'head' region of the whole troponin complex binds approximately 200 A away near residues 150-180 of the tropomyosin molecule.\r"

As an initial approach to understanding the role of this gamma-chain of TCR (TCR gamma) in T-cell development, we have studied the ontogeny of TCR expression at the protein level in the developing murine thymus. We show here that the first T3-associated TCR to be expressed in the developing thymus is a disulphide-linked heterodimer composed of a gamma-chain of relative molecular mass 35,000 (Mr 35K) and a 45K partner (termed TCR delta). This TCR gamma delta is first detected approximately two days before the appearance of cell-surface TCR alpha beta heterodimers. We report that N-glycosidase digestions reveal that all of the gamma-protein expressed on fetal thymocytes, as in adult CD4-8-(L3T4-, Lyt2-) thymocytes, bear N-linked carbohydrate side chains. The major gamma-gene transcribed in mature, alpha beta-bearing T cells (V gamma 1.2C gamma 2)encodes no N-linked glycosylation site so these results suggest that the fetal gamma delta receptor defines a distinct T-cell lineage whose development in the thymus precedes classical alpha beta-bearing cells.\r"

The specific antigen recognition structure (TCR) on murine T cells has been shown to be dependent on a polymorphic set of disulphide-linked heterodimers, containing two integral membrane glycoprotein chains, TCR alpha and TCR beta, expressed in non-covalent association with an invariant complex of proteins, CD3 (T3). Recently, a novel TCR/CD3 complex, that includes the product of the TCR gamma gene, has been identified on a subset of both peripheral cells and thymocytes. Here we examine the expression of TCR/CD3 complexes in fetal ontogeny and in the adult thymus. The results demonstrate that CD3+4-8-(T3+,L3T4-,Lyt2-)cells are detected in day-15 fetal thymi, throughout fetal development and in adult thymus. In situ hybridization studies indicate that these early CD3+ cells express high levels of TCR gamma-specific RNA, low levels of TCR beta-specific RNA and no detectable TCR alpha-specific RNA. Day-16 CD3+,4-,8- fetal thymocytes can be activated to proliferate and demonstrate cytolytic activity when cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies and interleukin-2 (IL-2). These results suggest that CD3-bearing cells, present early in thymic ontogeny, express a functional TCR and may, therefore, be important in repertoire development.\r"

Whereas both chains of Ti, an acidic alpha-chain of Mr 48-54K and a more basic beta-chain of Mr 40-44K, contain variable and constant region domains, the component peptides of CD3 are invariant. Several laboratories have more recently reported the expression of CD3 in association with a novel protein. On the surface of long-term T-cell lines and one thymocyte clone this novel structure consists of a 40K protein noncovalently linked to a 55 or 62K protein identified as the protein product of the Ti gamma-chain gene, a T-cell specific gene which like the Ti alpha- and Ti beta-chain genes undergoes rearrangement of variable (V) and joining (J) region gene segments. On the human T-cell leukaemic line PEER we have detected only a single 55K glycoprotein associated with CD3. We here demonstrate that an anti-Ti gamma-peptide antiserum reacts with the 55K CD3-associated protein on PEER. Most previously described human Ti gamma-chain complementary DNA clones encode the products of non-functional rearrangements. One of the Ti gamma cDNAs isolated from PEER, however, represents a functional rearrangement reported for the first time in a cell which expresses a Ti gamma-chain protein product on the cell surface. Interestingly, a 48-base-pair (bp) sequence in the constant (C) region domain of this functional Ti gamma-chain cDNA is triplicated in PEER and duplicated in other cDNAs isolated from PEER and other cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular clock hypothesis postulates that the rate of molecular evolution is approximately constant over time. Although this hypothesis has been highly controversial in the past, it is now widely accepted. The assumption of rate constancy has often been taken as a basis for reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among organisms or genes and for dating evolutionary events. Further, it has been taken as strong support for the neutral mutation hypothesis, which postulates that the majority of molecular changes in evolution are due to neutral or nearly neutral mutations. For these reasons, the validity of the rate constancy assumption is a vital issue in molecular evolution. Recent studies using DNA sequence data have raised serious doubts about the hypothesis. These studies provided support for the suggestion made from immunological distance and protein sequence data that a rate slowdown has occurred in hominoid evolution, and showed, in agreement with DNA hybridization studies, that rates of nucleotide substitution are significantly higher in rodents than in man. Here, rates of nucleotide substitution in rodents are estimated to be 4-10 times higher than those in higher primates and 2-4 times higher than those in artiodactyls. Further, this study provides strong evidence for the hominoid slowdown hypothesis and suggests a further rate-slowdown in hominoid evolution. Our results suggest that the variation in rate among mammals is primarily due to differences in generation time rather than changes in DNA repair mechanisms. We also propose a method for estimating the divergence times between species when the rate constancy assumption is violated.\r"

Sequence analysis shows an overall homology of 60% between LCa and LCb and the presence of brain-specific insertion sequences. These findings suggest that the different light chains have both shared and specialized functions. To address this question we have used a panel of monoclonal antibodies to identify two structurally and functionally distinct regions in the clathrin light-chain sequences. One region (residues 158-208) is exposed in native clathrin structures (triskelions and coated vesicles) and includes the brain-specific insertion sequences. The second region (residues 93-157), which is cryptic in native clathrin structures, is involved in binding the clathrin heavy chain and contains the region of strongest homology with intermediate filament proteins.\r"

  ".U": "87144660\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of resting T lymphocytes is initiated by the interaction of cell-surface receptors with their corresponding ligands. In addition to activation through the CD3 (T3)-Ti antigen-receptor complex, recent experiments have demonstrated induction of T-cell proliferation through the CD2 (T11) molecule, traditionally known as the erythrocyte(E)-receptor, through which T cells can bind red blood cells (RBC). This 'alternative pathway' of T-cell activation was observed in vitro in response to combinations of anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to distinct epitopes of CD2, such as mAbs against T11(2) plus T11(3). The physiological importance of this activation pathway can be assessed only by studying the effects of a naturally occurring ligand of CD2 on T-cell activation. We have recently described such a ligand, a glycoprotein of apparent relative molecular mass 42,000 (Mr 42K) that is expressed on all blood cells and some other tissues. Here we demonstrate that binding of this cell surface molecule, termed T11 target structure or T11TS, to CD2 (T11) induces reactivity in resting T cells to a mitogenic stimulus given by a mAb to the T11(3) determinant or by submitogenic concentrations of anti-T11(2+3) mAbs. Thus, one of the signals required for T-cell activation through the alternative pathway is provided by the interaction of CD2 with a naturally occurring complementary cell-surface molecule.\r"

It has been postulated that induction of class II in epithelial cells such as endocrine cells, which are normally class II negative, may result in autoimmunity. In type I diabetes, islet beta cells, the target of the autoimmune process, selectively express class II antigens. But in contrast to most other cell types, islet beta cells are not stimulated to express class II by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and thus the conditions under which this induction occurs have been particularly elusive. The cytotoxins tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin (LT) synergize with IFN-gamma in a number of activities. We report here that IFN-gamma in combination with either TNF or LT induces islet cell class II expression. This finding has important implications for the pathogenesis of type I diabetes and the understanding of the differential control of class II expression.\r"

Single-agent chemotherapy induced complete remission in 38 of 42 patients (91%) with low-risk metastatic disease. Survival of high-risk patients has improved markedly over the past two decades; complete remission was attained in 13 of 24 high-risk patients (54%) from 1965-1975, and in 21 of 27 (78%) from 1976-1985. Survival correlated with the number of high-risk factors, the prognostic score, and the type of treatment. From 1965-1975, 54% (13 of 24) of high-risk patients were treated with single-agent chemotherapy alone, while in the last decade only 7% (two of 27) were so treated. Twenty-one patients with traditional high-risk factors had a prognostic score of 7 or less, and all achieved remission, with 67% (14 of 21) treated with primary single-agent chemotherapy. The prognostic scoring system was more effective than traditional high-risk criteria at predicting which patients require intensive combination chemotherapy to attain remission.\r"

Ovarian estrogen secretion was reduced to castrate levels during most of the course of treatment. Blinded evaluation of laparoscopic photographs confirmed marked suppression of visually apparent disease, but biopsy specimens showed occult, inactive endometriosis in most cases. Marked pain relief was noted by all patients. As a result of this \"medical oophorectomy,\" the women experienced severe hot flashes, and many had insomnia and emotional disturbances. Vaginal cytology showed menopausal changes but related symptoms were generally mild. Calcium excretion rose to menopausal levels. High-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol remained unchanged. These results indicate that GnRH agonist administration has impressive effects on endometriotic implants, and these actions may be enhanced with longer therapy. Further development of this new form of therapy should involve either use of lesser degrees of ovarian suppression or adjunctive therapy to counter the side effects of \"medical oophorectomy.\"\r"

Proper management of streptococcal pharyngitis has contributed significantly to the decline in ARF. Penicillin treatment has clearly altered the natural history of streptococcal infection; the acute illness is shortened, risk of spread of infection is reduced, suppurative complications are prevented and ARF is prevented. Some cases of acute glomerulonephritis may be prevented. The decline in rheumatic fever has probably contributed to a greater interest in clinical benefits of therapy. Antigen detection tests appear promising for providing a more rapid bacteriologic diagnosis of streptococcal infection, which in turn permits prompt treatment. While penicillin has been the treatment of choice for four decades, a disturbing trend of increasing numbers of clinical relapses or recurrent infections has been noted in recent years. Alternative antibiotics, such as the oral cephalosporins, may now be superior to oral penicillin in terms of lessening the risk of relapse. This advantage must be weighed against other factors including cost effectiveness. The most pressing dilemma for the clinician is management of the patient with repeated episodes of acute streptococcal pharyngitis. Certain of these problem patients may benefit from a period of penicillin prophylaxis during the seasons when streptococcal infections are most prevalent. There is now agreement that posttreatment throat cultures need not be done in the child who remains asymptomatic following therapy. However, it is incumbent on the clinician to make certain that appropriate therapy is prescribed and that compliance with oral regimens of therapy is satisfactory in the management of the patient with acute streptococcal pharyngitis.\r"

Some authors have suggested that some contribution to neurofibromatosis's variability may be an adverse effect of a mother's neurofibromatosis on the overall severity seen in her offspring with neurofibromatosis. In the present study of 188 maternal affected, paternal affected, and sporadic von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis cases, the maternal influence question was systematically examined. Overall severity, selected features most likely to reflect in utero maternal influence, and other common neurofibromatosis-I features were analyzed statistically. Age, racial composition, and gender of the three groups were similar. No significant differences were found (P less than or equal to .01) between maternal affected, paternal affected, and sporadic cases in terms of overall severity, probability of reaching advanced severity as a function of age, indications of possible prenatal influence (eg, congenital neurofibromas, tibial pseudarthrosis), or other neurofibromatosis features. These results demonstrate that the nature and severity of neurofibromatosis for maternal affected cases are essentially the same as for paternal affected and sporadic cases.\r"

The first three patients also received radiation therapy (5,500 rads). Locally recurrent tumors developed in four of the children after previous operative removal; the other two had tumors that could not be removed initially. The tumors arose in the neck (three patients), pelvis (two patients), or foot (one patient). In the three patients treated with VAC alone, complete disappearance of tumor was confirmed at second operation in two, and greater than 75% shrinkage on CT scans occurred in the third, all at 4 to 6 months after VAC was started. In two of the three patients who received VAC plus radiation therapy, complete disappearance of tumor occurred at 13 and 16 months; the third had no response. Five of the six patients are free of recurrent fibromatosis at 1, 2, 4, and 11 years after VAC was begun; the sixth has required multiple operations during the last 6 years. We conclude that combination chemotherapy with VAC can produce regression of fibromatosis in some children with recurrent or unresectable lesions. The administration of VAC should be considered for children with fibromatosis in whom operative removal is not feasible, would prove mutilating, or is unlikely to produce long-term control of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that intracellular Ca2+ is an essential component of the intracellular mechanism of insulin action in the adipocyte was evaluated. Cells were loaded with the Ca2+ chelator quin-2, by preincubating them with quin-2 AM, the tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester of quin-2. Quin-2 loading inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport (IC50, 26 microM quin-2 AM) without affecting basal activity. The ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in quin-2-loaded cells could be partially restored by preincubating cells with buffer supplemented with 1.2 mM CaCl2 and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. These conditions had no effect on basal activity and omission of CaCl2 from the buffer prevented the restoration of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by A23187. Quin-2 loading also inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation (IC50, 11 microM quin-2 AM) and the ability of insulin to inhibit cAMP-stimulated lipolysis (IC50, 78 microM quin-2 AM), without affecting their basal activities. Incubation of cells with 100 microM quin-2 or quin-2 AM had no effect on intracellular ATP concentration or the specific binding of 125I-labeled insulin to adipocytes. These findings suggest that intracellular Ca2+ is an essential component in the coupling of the insulin-activated receptor complex to cellular physiological/metabolic machinery. Furthermore, differing quin-2 AM dose-response profiles suggest the presence of dual Ca2+-dependent pathways in the adipocyte. One involves insulin stimulation of glucose transport and oxidation, whereas the other involves the antilipolytic action of insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Evolutionary aspects of high mutation pressure were studied in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have irradiation histories up to 600 generations. Dose-response regressions for the x-ray induction of various types of mutation were obtained from six of these populations. The sensitivity of these irradiated populations relative to an unirradiated control population was characterized by dose reduction factors. Sensitivity decreased stepwise with the stepwise increase in irradiation levels to which the populations had been exposed every generation (0 R, 2 kR, 4 kR, 8 kR; 1 R = 0.258 mC/kg) but remained the same over hundreds of generations when the irradiation levels were constant. Resistance is controlled by single genetic factors. Additional factors evolved in subpopulations exposed to increased irradiation levels, and different factors evolved in populations that were kept separate from the beginning of their irradiation histories. Two of three factors persisted in subpopulations no longer irradiated, but one factor disappeared; this last one behaved like a transposon. Factors of relative radio-resistance are stage specific (immature oocytes) and some of them are assumed to modify or control mutation-rate genes. The resistance factors enable populations to achieve an equilibrium between the amounts of environmental mutagens and intrinsic mutation rates.\r"

A molecular clock (silent molecular clock), measured by the degree of sequence divergence at the synonymous (silent) positions of protein-encoding regions, was introduced for the present study. From the comparison of nucleotide sequences of alpha1-antitrypsin and beta- and delta-globin genes between humans and Old World monkeys, the silent molecular clock was calibrated: the mean evolutionary rate of silent substitution was determined to be 1.56 X 10(-9) substitutions per site per year. Using the silent molecular clock, the mean divergence dates of chimpanzee and orangutan from the human lineage were estimated as 6.4 +/- 2.6 million years and 17.3 +/- 4.5 million years, respectively. It was also shown that the evolutionary rate of primate genes is considerably slower than those of other mammalian genes.\r"

Using the V kappa-Ars gene as a hybridization probe, we provide evidence that the V kappa 10 family is relatively small and that only one member gives rise to the productive allele in all Ars-A antibodies. An unusual feature of Ars-A light chains is that all contain an arginine at position 96, the V-J junctional position. We had shown by chain recombination that arginine-96 was essential for antigen binding. In the present study, an arginine codon was not found either at the 3' end of the V kappa-Ars gene segment or at the 5' end of J kappa 1. However, an arginine codon (CGG) can easily be generated by recombination between these two germ-line elements. Thus, we document that junctional diversity through intracodonic recombination can be crucial to the antibody binding function of the resulting molecule.\r"

W6/32, a monomorphic antibody directed against class I HLA-A,B,C antigens, significantly inhibited the phytohemagglutinin-induced cell proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Almost complete suppression of cell activation was achieved on a subfraction of peripheral blood lymphocytes enriched in Mo1+ monocyte/macrophage cells. This inhibition of cell proliferation takes place at an early stage of activation and was found to be adherent cell dependent. Removal of monocyte/macrophage type cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes completely abrogated the inhibitory influence of anti-HLA-class I antibody, and, upon adding them back, suppression reappeared. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that the expression of receptors for interleukin 2 and transferrin was impaired in the presence of antibody. Although the amount of interleukin 2 synthesized by these cells was also reduced, the addition of exogenous purified interleukin 2 did not restore cell proliferation. Mitogenesis induced by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was similarly suppressed, but mitogenesis induced by the phorbol diester phorbol myristate acetate, which activates cells by directly stimulating protein kinase C, was not suppressed. These results are consistent with a hypothesis that HLA class I antigens regulate an early event(s) of the Ca2+-dependent pathway of activation of T lymphocytes and that this event(s) apparently occurs before protein kinase C stimulation.\r"

We report that purines (A greater than G) in the first and/or fourth base-pair positions of occupied echinomycin-binding sites are hyperreactive to diethyl pyrocarbonate. The correspondence of the solid-state data and the sites of diethyl pyrocarbonate hyperreactivity suggests that diethyl pyrocarbonate may be a sensitive reagent for the detection of Hoogsteen base-pairing in solution. Moreover, a 12-base-pair segment of alternating A-T DNA, which is 6 base pairs away from the nearest strong echinomycin-binding site, is also hyperreactive to diethyl pyrocarbonate in the presence of echinomycin. This hyperreactive segment may be an altered form of right-handed DNA that is entirely Hoogsteen base-paired.\r"

Along the other axis the mean distance was 4.1 A and appeared to vary monotonically over several intermolecular distances, indicating that a superstructure of longer range may exist. The molecular density was one molecular per 19.4 A2. The surprising ability of the scanning tunneling microscope to image the individual molecular chains demonstrates that electrons from the graphite can be transferred along the molecular chains for a distance of 50 A.\r"

NaDodSO4/PAGE analysis of eye proteins of flies carrying one, two, or three copies of the ninaC region shows that two eye-specific proteins of molecular weight 170,000 and 130,000 display a strong dependence on the dosage of the ninaC gene, although the dependence is evident only when the dosage is decreased and not when it is increased. All mutations in the ninaC gene studied to date have pronounced effects on these two polypeptides. These results suggest that the ninaC locus encodes these two polypeptides.

In small amounts (between 0.1 and 1 microgram/ml), elastin peptides strongly increased calcium influx and inhibited calcium efflux by an apparently calmodulin-dependent mechanism. They also were shown to increase sodium influx and to decrease rubidium influx in monocyte preparations obtained from human blood. Only the ouabain-sensitive portion of rubidium influx was inhibited. The action of elastin peptides is strongly concentration-dependent; the maximal activity observed in the above reactions was less than 1 microgram/ml. These results suggest that elastin peptides may play a role in the regulation of the biological activity of mesenchymal cells, in the proximity of which they are released by the action of elastase-type enzymes. Such enzymes were demonstrated in aorta smooth muscle cells (membrane-bound serine protease) and in fibroblasts (metalloprotease). Monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were also shown to carry elastase-type enzymes. The release of peptides from elastin by elastase-type enzymes and the action of such peptides on the ion fluxes through the cell membrane may well be involved in mechanisms of the modulation of the phenotype of mesenchymal cells during aging as well as in the development of age-dependent pathologies such as arterioclerosis.\r"

For example, in a reconstituted system containing rabbit liver microsomal P-450 form 2, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, and NADPH, cumyl hydroperoxide yields acetophenone and methane, but no cumyl alcohol is formed. The stoichiometry of the reaction and similar results with alpha-methylbenzyl, benzyl, and t-butyl hydroperoxides are in accord with the following general equation, in which X represents an alkyl group and R and R' are either alkyl groups or hydrogen atoms in the starting peroxide: XRR'C-OOH + NADPH + H+----XRCO + R'H + H2O + NADP+. Because 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid yields pentane under these conditions, we propose that the known formation of alkanes and aldehydes in membrane lipid peroxidation involves reductive cleavage by P-450 to give the products predicted by the above equation. The cleavage reaction is thought to involve stepwise one-electron transfer, resulting in homolysis of the peroxide oxygen-oxygen bond and generation of an alkoxy radical, with beta-scission of the latter followed by reduction of the secondary radical to the hydrocarbon. In accordance with this scheme, when the cleavage reaction with cumyl hydroperoxide was done in 2H2O, deuteromethane was formed.\r"

This insert was subsequently used in both in vitro hybrid selection and hybrid-arrested translation studies. An mRNA species from HeLa cells of 3.6-3.7 kb was selected that was translated into a 116-kDa protein, which was selectively immunoprecipitated with anti-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. To confirm that the 1.3-kb insert from lambda gt11 encodes for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, the insert was used to screen a 3- to 4-kb subset of a transformed human fibroblast cDNA library in the Okayama-Berg vector. One of these vectors [pcD-p(ADPR)P; 3.6 kb] was tested in transient transfection experiments in COS cells. This cDNA insert contained the complete coding sequence for polymerase as indicated by the following criteria: A 3-fold increase in in vitro activity was noted in extracts from transfected cells compared to mock or pSV2-CAT transfected cells. A 6-fold increase in polymerase activity in pcD-p(ADPR)P transfected cell extracts compared to controls was observed by \"activity gel\" analysis on gels of electrophoretically separated proteins at 116 kDa.

To determine whether the phylogenetically conserved Phe-87 of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c helps to mediate electron transfer between cytochrome c and cytochrome c peroxidase, we have constructed mutants of cytochrome c that are altered at this position and now have studied the kinetics of long-range electron transfer within their complexes with zinc-substituted cytochrome c peroxidase. We find that the rate of electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to the zinc cytochrome c peroxidase pi-cation radical is four orders of magnitude greater when phenylalanine or tyrosine is present at position 87 than when serine or glycine is present.\r"

Biological evidence strongly suggests that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation modulates chromatin functions, although the precise molecular mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated. Here we describe conditions for the rapid uptake of exogenously supplied NAD+ by living hepatocytes in primary monolayer culture. Raising the intracellular NAD+ concentration by 70% caused a 5-fold increase of chromatin-bound poly(ADP-ribose). We conclude that the constitutive level of posttranslational poly(ADP-ribose) modifications of chromatin proteins in mammalian cells is related to the availability of NAD+, which varies in different physiological and pathological states. We propose that poly-(ADP-ribose) may serve a hitherto unrecognized function by signaling altered metabolic conditions to the chromatin and thus modulate its functions in tune with changing metabolic states.\r"

Using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter to enumerate cytotoxic T lymphocyte-target cell conjugates, we show that phorbol esters at concentrations that triggered lysis of non-antigen-bearing target cells also increased the number of stable conjugates with these target cells. The results point to the importance of the antigen-nonspecific engagements of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in immunologic surveillance. The data also show that the linkage between the T-cell receptor and antigen is not mandatory for conjugate formation, for the strengthening of conjugates, and for lysis.\r"

Similar crosslinking-induced signals were seen for a subset of mouse thymocyte differentiation antigens. The various antigens on human T cells differed in the extent of crosslinking required for generating the calcium signal, as evidenced by comparisons with monoclonal versus polyclonal second-step antibody. The [Ca2+]i increase that occurs after crosslinking represents mobilization of cytoplasmic calcium since the initial component of the signal is resistant to depletion of extracellular calcium by chelation with EGTA. The [Ca2+]i increase is completely inhibited by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin, indicating that a substrate for pertussis toxin regulates the signal transduction. Crosslinking of antigens other than the CD3/T-cell receptor complex did not result in T-cell proliferation. Crosslinking of CD2 and Tp44, but not other antigens, resulted in expression of functional interleukin 2 receptors. Comparisons of three different anti-CD3 antibodies showed that a second calcium signal was generated by crosslinking, even when the anti-CD3 antibodies were used at optimal concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Among the nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs there is generally a close correlation between the potency of their inhibition of arachidonate cyclooxygenase, and thus prostaglandin production, and their antiinflammatory activity. One anomaly in this generalization is that whereas aspirin and salicylate are equipotent as antiinflammatory agents, salicylate is less active than aspirin in inhibiting prostaglandin production in vitro. Using rats, we have now measured the concentrations of aspirin and salicylate in plasma and in inflammatory exudates after their oral administration and determined their effects on thromboxane B2 production in clotting blood and prostaglandin (PG) E2 concentrations in the exudates. We have also investigated the effects of both drugs, at concentrations achieved in the exudates, on PGE2 production by nonproliferative explants of acutely inflamed tissues. Aspirin is rapidly metabolized, resulting in peak concentrations of salicylate in the plasma and exudate that exceeded peak concentrations of aspirin by 30- to 50-fold. Furthermore, concentrations of aspirin rapidly declined, whereas high concentrations of salicylate persisted in the plasma and in the exudate for up to 6 hr after a single administration of aspirin. Both drugs reduced PGE2 concentrations in inflammatory exudates by 50-70%, but aspirin was considerably more potent than salicylate in inhibiting thromboxane B2 production in clotting blood. The concentration of salicylate found in inflammatory exudates 6 hr after the administration of aspirin was sufficient to reduce PGE2 production in explants by more than 50%. We conclude that the antiinflammatory action of both drugs depends on the inhibition of PGE2 synthesis by salicylate.\r"

Fungal causes have been reported far less frequently. Bacillus species are being recognized increasingly as major causes of posttraumatic ocular disease, with rates of infection often making them the second most commonly isolated organisms. Bacillus cereus, an especially virulent pathogen, causes a fulminant endophthalmitis characterized by rapid destruction of intravitreal contents and a uniformly poor visual outcome. Certain toxins elaborated by the organism may contribute to its particular virulence. The currently recommended approach to suspected posttraumatic infection involves early use of diagnostic vitrectomy and intraocular culture, use of intravitreal antibiotics, and combination treatment with systemic and periocular antibiotics.\r"

The technique known as \"reverse genetics,\" in which chromosomal map positions and genetically linked DNA markers are used to identify and clone such genes, is complicated by the fact that the molecular distances from the closest DNA markers to the gene itself are often too large to traverse by standard cloning techniques. To address this situation, a general human chromosome jumping library was constructed that allows the cloning of DNA sequences approximately 100 kilobases away from any starting point in genomic DNA. As an illustration of its usefulness, this library was searched for a jumping clone, starting at the met oncogene, which is a marker tightly linked to the cystic fibrosis gene that is located on human chromosome 7. Mapping of the new genomic fragment by pulsed field gel electrophoresis confirmed that it resides on chromosome 7 within 240 kilobases downstream of the met gene. The use of chromosome jumping should now be applicable to any genetic locus for which a closely linked DNA marker is available.\r"

When injected into the hypothalamus, however, vasopressin specifically inhibited the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Thus, vasopressin may exert differential regulatory effects on thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.\r"

In addition to the two known monoadducts, a bisadduct was obtained. Reductive MC activation with Na2S2O4 (sodium dithionite) leads to exclusive bifunctional alkylation. The structure of the bisadduct was determined by spectroscopic methods that included proton magnetic resonance, differential Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and circular dichroism. Formation of the same bisadduct in vivo was demonstrated upon injection of rats with MC. Computer-generated models of the bisadduct that was incorporated into the center of the duplex B-DNA decamer d(CGTACGTACG)2 indicated that the bisadduct fit snugly into the minor groove with minimal distortion of DNA structure. A mechanistic analysis of the factors that govern monofunctional and bifunctional adduct formation is presented.\r"

The injected oocytes expressed a novel voltage-dependent potassium current. This current was not observed in oocytes injected with RNA from several other excitable tissues, including rat brain and uterine smooth muscle from ovariectomized rats not treated with estrogen. The activation of this current on depolarization was exceptionally slow, particularly for depolarizations from relatively negative membrane potentials. Such a slowly activating channel may play an important role in the slow, repetitive bursts of action potentials in the myometrium.\r"

All the peptides bound more than one Ia molecule; however, for 11 of 12 peptides, the dominant binding was to the restriction element, whereas in one instance the dominant binding was to a nonrestriction element. When the peptides were used to inhibit the presentation of antigen by prefixed accessory cells to T cells, an excellent correlation was found between the capacity of a peptide to inhibit the binding of an antigen to purified Ia and the capacity of the peptide to inhibit accessory cell presentation of the antigen. Thus, the binding of peptide to purified Ia is immunologically relevant, and Ia seems to be the only saturable molecule on the surface of the accessory cell involved in antigen presentation. Inhibition analysis also indicated that all peptides restricted to a particular Ia molecule competitively inhibited one another, suggesting that each Ia restriction element has a single binding site for antigen. Cross-linking of labeled peptides to Ia followed by electrophoretic analysis and autoradiography suggested that this single binding site is made up of portions of both alpha and beta chains of Ia.\r"

The increased transport rate in ras- and src-transfected cells was paralleled by a marked increase in the amount of glucose transporter protein, as assessed by immunoblots, as well as by a markedly increased abundance of glucose transporter messenger RNA. Exposure of control cells to the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 18 hours had a similar effect of increasing the rate of glucose transport and the abundance of transporter messenger RNA. For ras, src, and TPA, the predominant mechanism responsible for activation of the transport system is increased expression of the structural gene encoding the glucose transport protein.\r"

The action of the kappa enhancer augments that of the octanucleotide in B lymphoid cells; when both elements are present, tk promoter activity is increased by more than an order of magnitude. In contrast, the presence of the octanucleotide in this promoter markedly reduces its response to a nonimmunoglobulin enhancer.

  ".W": "The role of calcium in regulating the contractile state of smooth muscle has been investigated by measuring calcium and contraction in single smooth muscle cells with the calcium-sensitive dye fura-2 and the digital imaging microscope. The concentration of free calcium in the cytoplasm increased after stimulation of the cells by depolarization with high potassium or by application of carbachol. Changes in calcium always preceded contraction. The increase in calcium induced by these stimuli was limited to less than 1 microM. Calcium within the nucleus was also subject to a limitation of its rise during contraction. Intranuclear calcium rose from 200 nM at rest to no more than 300 nM while cytoplasmic calcium rose to over 700 nM. These apparent ceilings for both cytoplasmic and intranuclear calcium may result either from negative feedback of calcium on cytoplasmic and nuclear calcium channel gating mechanisms, respectively, or from the presence of calcium pumps that are strongly activated at the calcium ceilings.\r"

  ".W": "Fiscal considerations prompted comparison of cefotaxime (a third generation cephalosporin) with cefamandole (a second generation cephalosporin) for prophylaxis in the surgical treatment of the biliary tract. One hundred and eight patients who underwent an operation upon the biliary tract received three 1 gram doses of cefotaxime (54 patients) or cefamandole (54 patients) at induction of anesthesia and then one and three hours later. The study was prospective, blinded and randomized. The groups (cefotaxime versus cefamandole) were statistically comparable for age, sex, diagnosis, type and duration of operation and positive cultures. The most prevalent bacteria isolated from qualitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures of bile and the wall of the gallbladder were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus and Klebsiella. The incidence of bactibilia in patients with one of these conditions was: 75 per cent for cancer; 69 per cent for patients more than 60 years old; 33 per cent for jaundice; 58 per cent for pancreatitis; 60 per cent for exploration of the common bile duct, and 22 per cent for acute cholecystitis. Microbiologic agar diffusion assays of tissue from the wall of the gallbladder, subcutaneous fat and rectus muscle and samples of bile and serum obtained 30 minutes after the second dose of antibiotic showed a statistically significant greater concentration of cefamandole in the wall of the gallbladder. Otherwise there was no difference between the concentration of cefamandole and cefotaxime. The groups showed no statistical difference for temperature of more than or equal to 38 degrees C. on two consecutive measurements, postoperative wound and urinary infections, postoperative hospital stay and days in the intensive care unit and incidence of readmission within a month. Prophylactic use of cefotaxime in a three dose regimen provided no advantage in prophylaxis compared with cefamandole.\r"

They comprised 193 patients of whom 180 underwent fornicotomy for the treatment of epilepsy, and 13 underwent removal of third ventricle colloid cysts. Only 4 were reported to have persistent memory loss postoperatively and they were in the colloid cyst group. Within the limitations inherent to this type of analysis and to the problems of detection and quantification of memory deficits, the reviewed material supports the hypothesis that with anterior fornix section we are only interfering with a part of the structural system subserving memory and that the tumor, the surgical trauma, or other destructive pathology, or a combination of factors including the variability of neural localization, may cause persistent memory loss by additional damage to structures other than the anterior fornix. Language and geographical barriers may explain the apparent failure in communication between early investigators.\r"

  ".U": "87149563\r", 
  ".W": "Hypercapnia in patients with pulmonary disease is believed to result from an interaction between mechanical lung impairment and intrinsic chemical respiratory drive. We tested this hypothesis in this study by examining the ventilatory (delta VE/delta PCO2) and occlusion pressure (delta P100/delta PCO2) responses to CO2 in 12 obese patients with no history of alveolar hypoventilation and correlating these with their ventilatory responses to abdominal surgery. Preoperatively the mean vital capacity (VC) was 78% +/- 6% standard error of the mean predicted, the delta VE/delta PCO2 was 1.56 +/- 0.26 L/min/torr, delta P100/delta PCO2 was 0.25 +/- 0.08 cm H2O/torr, the mean PaCO2 37.9 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, and mean PO2 77.6 +/- 3.7 mm Hg. Postoperatively the VC decreased to 56% +/- 6% of the preoperative value. PCO2 values at 24 hours increased in six patients, were unchanged in three, and decreased in three patients. However, over the entire spectrum of PCO2 change, both indexes of CO2 chemosensitivity correlated strongly with the postoperative change in PCO2 (r = -0.86 for delta VE/delta PCO2 and r = -0.66 for delta P100/delta PCO2). All six patients with a delta VE/delta PCO2 of 1.5 L/min/torr or less manifested postoperative increases in PCO2, while those with greater values did not (p = 0.005). In contrast, neither preoperative nor postoperative VC showed high correlations with postoperative PCO2 (r = -0.56 and -0.43, respectively). Thus ventilatory responses to CO2 predicted postoperative PCO2 at both ends of the spectrum; low responders hypoventilated while high responders hyperventilated. We conclude that in obese subjects, CO2 chemosensitivity plays a permissive role in determining the net ventilatory responses to situations that either mechanically load the respiratory system or modulate ventilation such as postoperative pain or analgesia.\r"

  ".U": "87149863\r", 
  ".W": "We have studied the effects of the mucolytic thiol agent mercapto-ethanesulphonate (mesna) on the activity of both polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN) elastase and antileucoprotease in vitro. In all tests a specific synthetic substrate was used to measure elastase activity, which was then related to enzyme activity in the absence of mesna. The relative elastase activity decreased to 67.5% of control values after the enzyme had been incubated in a 120 mmol/l mesna solution. In the sol phase of purulent sputum, elastase activity decreased to 45% after the sol phase had been incubated in a 600 mmol/l mesna solution. The inability to reverse the inhibition of mesna by increasing the substrate concentration indicated that mesna acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of PMN elastase. Incubation of elastase with antileucoprotease reduced the relative elastase activity to 21%. When antileucoprotease was preincubated in a 60 mmol/l mesna solution under identical assay conditions, a relative elastase activity of 39% was observed. Inhibition experiments with mesna treated antileucoprotease, in which sulphydryl groups were blocked with iodoacetamide, strongly suggested that the dissociation constant (Ki) of the fraction of antileucoprotease that retains activity after the incubation with mesna was not changed. Elastase inhibitory activity in mucoid sol phase, which can be ascribed mainly to antileucoprotease, decreased to 53% after incubation with mesna at a concentration of 960 mmol/l. Incubation of PMN elastase/antileucoprotease complex with mesna did not result in any release of active PMN elastase from the antileucoprotease. It is concluded that mesna and other thiol compounds, when locally administered, may influence the proteinase-antiproteinase balance in the airways by their effect on both PMN elastase and antileucoprotease.\r"

All seven were significantly improved by the use of 4 volumes of serum, rather than 1, with 1 volume of red cell suspension, and a low-ionic antiglobin test (LIAGT) was distinctly superior to the other six procedures evaluated. In this test, during the incubation of serum and cells at 37 degrees for 20 minutes, ionic concentration was reduced 62 percent. However, after removal of all supernatant, the red cells were washed three times with an isotonic solution that provided 80 percent reduction in ionic concentration, and the washed cells were tested for their agglutinability with low-ionic (80% ionic reduction) anti-IgG antiglobin reagent. This modified LIAGT was usually more, and apparently never less, sensitive than a test described earlier and is expected to be associated with much less nonspecificity. The extreme sensitivity of LIAGT for many long-term frozen stored alloantiserums is a retained property of the modified test and has been associated with IgG aggregation during storage.\r"

One hundred antibodies were coded, titrated, and tested in parallel. LIP did not detect 36 antibodies: 31 anti-K, two anti-E, two anti-Fya, and one anti-Jka. LIPAT did not detect seven anti-K, two anti-E, and two anti-Jka. The combination of LIP and LIPAT did not detect two anti-E that were reactive only in a two-stage enzyme test and seven anti-K that had titers of 2 or lower by LISS. LISS detected all antibodies except for the two enzyme-reactive anti-E. There were no significant differences in the titers of 63 percent of the antibodies studied. For 54 percent of the antibodies in the Kell system, LISS produced significantly higher titers; for 25 percent of antibodies in the Rh system, LIP did so. The poor sensitivity of the Polybrene kit for anti-K makes it unsuitable as a primary method for antibody screening.\r"

The extra step of an Rh control, which is necessary with IgG slide and rapid tube anti-D serums, is thus eliminated. However, this report shows that adopting this practice can be misleading and dangerous. Two cases are reviewed in which the chemically modified anti-D gave false-positive results and the ABO typing did not act as an adequate control.\r"

Heat treatment of the lyophilized concentrate for 72 hours at 60 degrees C results in less than 10 percent loss of factor VIII activity. This process does not require expensive fractionation equipment, is suitable for small-to medium-scale batch concentrate production and could be adopted by moderately well-equipped regional blood processing laboratories for the decentralized production of a high-quality, heat-treated factor VIII concentrate.\r"

We applied knowledge of the radiographic appearance of spinal alterations in modern humans to the evaluation of 48 fused thoracic and lumbar fossilized spine specimens from the prehistoric saber-toothed cat (Smilodon californicus), in which prominent paravertebral ossification is frequently found. Inspection, conventional radiography, and, in some cases, CT and fluoride analyses were performed. The spinal alterations in the saber-toothed cat, which previously were believed to be caused primarily by trauma, showed characteristics of three major pathologic processes: trauma, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, and inflammatory disease of a type similar to ankylosing spondylitis. The last two categories have rarely been diagnosed in species other than humans. The results suggest that diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and inflammatory spondyloarthropathy are diseases that occurred in prehistoric times and are not confined to the human species.\r"

Although 10 of the 15 patients had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure, as well as normal ventricular wall thickness and normal values for left ventricular systolic function, five (50%) of them showed mild or moderate myocardial uptake. On the other hand, none had characteristic highly refractile myocardial echoes on the two-dimensional echocardiographic images (p less than 0.01), and values for diastolic function were reduced in four of the five and normal in the remaining one. In 85 control subjects, diffuse positive pyrophosphate scans of the heart were found in four (5%) of them (three with dilated cardiomyopathy and one with sarcoidosis), and highly refractile granular sparkling echoes were observed in nine (11%) (five with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, three with aortic stenosis, and one with hypereosinophilic syndrome). We conclude that Tc-99m-PYP scanning is a more sensitive and specific method and may have the potential ability to detect amyloid heart disease in the earlier stage of familial amyloid polyneuropathy than two-dimensional echocardiography.\r"

Conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved within 45 minutes in 76%: in 25 patients with atrial fibrillation (76% conversion), 15 with atrioventricular (AV) nodal or AV reentrant tachycardia (100% conversion) and 10 with atrial flutter or atrial reentrant tachycardia (40% conversion). Adverse effects were noted in 21 patients (42%): paresthesia in 9, drowsiness in 8, nausea in 2, accelerated ventricular rate in 5, ventricular tachycardia in 1, sinus bradycardia in 1 and hypotension in 5. Adverse effects were associated with larger dosage and atrial flutter or atrial reentrant tachycardia. Thus, flecainide acetate is effective in converting to sinus rhythm acute atrial fibrillation and AV nodal and AV reentrant tachycardias, but not atrial flutter or atrial reentrant tachycardia.\r"

Eight patients responded to initial application with more than a 20% reduction in mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure. Cardiac index increased from a control value of 2.1 +/- 0.5 to 2.4 +/- 0.6 liters/min/m2 at 2 hours (p less than 0.05) and mean pulmonary wedge pressure was reduced from 22 +/- 5 to 16 +/- 6 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). The 2 nonresponders had the largest left ventricular volumes on 2-dimensional echocardiograms. Responders were randomized to intermittent (16 hours/day) or continuous (24 hours/day) treatment for 1 month followed by a month of the alternate treatment. After 1 month of intermittent treatment, the hemodynamic response after reapplication was similar to the initial response. After another month of continuous treatment, hemodynamic values 24 hours after application were similar to initial control values and there was no change after removal and reapplication. Thus, the moderate vasodilator effect of transdermal nitroglycerin in CHF is maintained with intermittent treatment, whereas tolerance develops with continuous treatment.\r"

Metabolic rate (M) was measured by indirect calorimetry following an overnight fast. Subgroups then received a continuous intragastric infusion of a formula diet at three levels: submaintenance (mean +/- SEM, 1.02 +/- 0.04 times fasting M, n = 6), maintenance (1.39 +/- 0.01 times fasting M, n = 20), or supramaintenance (2.77 +/- 0.2 times fasting M, n = 14). Formula inflow was started in the evening, and intraprandial M was measured throughout the following day. Relative to fasting, submaintenance and maintenance infusions produced no detectable change in M. With supramaintenance infusion, M increased significantly (10.1%, p less than 0.05) above fasting level. Hence during continuous formula infusion a rise in M above fasting occurs only when rate of energy infusion exceeds rate of thermal energy losses. These results have implications in regard to energetic efficiency of continuous fuel infusion relative to intermittent food or formula ingestion.\r"

However, sweet acidophilus milk, which contains lactase-rich organisms, does not enhance lactose digestion. Using breath-hydrogen measurements to indicate malabsorption in 14 human subjects, we compared utilization of: milk, yogurt, heated yogurt, yogurt plus lactose, heated yogurt plus lactase, sweet acidophilus milk (SAM), and SAM made with sonicated cells. Results indicate that both the reduction of lactose during fermentation and the presence of indigenous bacterial lactase are responsible for the increased ability to tolerate lactose in yogurt. Improved utilization of SAM by sonication suggests that intracellular lactase is not available during digestion and that sonication releases the lactase activity from the cells.\r"

Weight-for-length gain for initial 60 days in Zn-supplemented group was 9% of standard vs 3% for placebo (p less than 0.05). Energy intake was similar in both groups. Incidence of infections, especially pyoderma, was significantly higher in placebo group: 10 of 16 vs 3 of 16 in the supplemented group (p less than 0.025). Plasma Zn was correlated with number of febrile days in the prospective month (r = -0.66, p less than 0.05). The percent anergic infants decreased and serum IgA increased significantly only in Zn-supplemented group. Zinc supplementation has significant effects on weight gain and host defense mechanisms despite normal plasma levels. Zinc supplementation is recommended for optimal recovery from marasmus.\r"

These results were obtained by a new electrooptical device (Technicon H X 1) that provides complete blood cell counting and sizing. If whole blood is collected and diluted with a reagent used by the instrument to sphere and fix red blood cells and platelets, MPVs values do not change significantly within 180 minutes from venipuncture. This approach allows one to study the true values of MPVs on Technicon H X 1.\r"

The authors have examined 62 examples of MPNST immunohistochemically, using antibodies to S-100 protein, myelin basic protein (MBP), and Leu-7, all of which are potential neural markers. Sixty-eight percent of all cases expressed at least one of these three determinants, representing a higher rate of immunoreactivity than that seen for single nervous system antigens in previous studies. Conjoint reactivity for S-100/Leu-7, S-100/MBP, and MBP/Leu-7 was seen in 34%, 34%, and 24% of cases, respectively. This coexpression of antigens is important, because none of them in isolation is immunospecific for nerve sheath tumors. In addition, stains for epithelial membrane antigen were reactive in two epithelioid tumors in this series, and eight spindle-cell neoplasms demonstrated desmin positivity. Analyses for cytokeratin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and Factor VIII-related antigen were negative in all cases. These results indicate an overlap between the immunocytochemical attributes of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and other soft tissue sarcomas and emphasize the desirability of assessing multiple neural markers in such cases.\r"

The tissue quantitation method was precise, particularly at low values, where it was better than the FACS. A simpler and faster estimation method employing categories within 10 percentage units was also tested in this study; this method correlated as well with the FACS as the quantitation method and gave the best interobserver correlations.\r"

Electron microscopic examination revealed that these cells differed from true Gaucher cells and resembled storage cells previously described in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The patient's peripheral blood leukocyte beta-glucosidase and serum acid phosphatase levels were elevated, ruling out the diagnosis of inherited Gaucher's disease. After treatment with six monthly cycles of systemic chemotherapy (nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine, bleomycin, doxorubicin, and prednisone), all signs of Hodgkin's disease and pseudo-Gaucher cells disappeared. Repeat leukocyte beta-glucosidase and serum acid phosphatase levels were unchanged. The present case is unique with its documentation of classical enzyme patterns for beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase and electron microscopic features. The authors postulate that pseudo-Gaucher cells result from excessive cell breakdown with an overload of available beta-glucosidase.\r"

Serial gastric washes were performed after test meal administration and gastric contents were analyzed for DNA, pepsin, blood, sodium, potassium, parietal cell secretion, and nonparietal cell secretion. Both red pepper and black pepper caused significant increases in parietal secretion, pepsin secretion, and potassium loss. Gastric cell exfoliation (as reflected in DNA loss into gastric contents) was increased after red or black pepper administration; the increase after red pepper administration was dose dependent. Mucosal microbleeding was seen after spice administration and one subject had grossly visible gastric bleeding after both red pepper and black pepper administration. There were no significant differences from control between the test meals, in nonparietal volume, fractional recovery of the gastric secretions, or sodium secretion. Finally, no spice was significantly different from aspirin in any parameter studied; indeed, aspirin was comparable to the higher doses of pepper. The long-term result of daily pepper ingestion is unknown. Whether spices are detrimental, beneficial (e.g., inducing an adaptive cytoprotective response), or have no significant long-term effect on the gastric mucosa is unknown and deserves further study.\r"

Using sublines of the Walker 256 carcinoma, differing in the pattern of bone involvement, etidronate was found to inhibit hypercalcemia caused by systemically acting humoral factors, to inhibit bone metastasis following inoculation of tumor cells into the abdominal aorta, and to reduce the invasion of bone adjacent to tumors. Etidronate was also found to prevent bone metastasis in syngeneic rat mammary carcinoma. Etidronate was found devoid of direct antineoplastic activity, whether administered intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intravenously, in a series of murine tumors of different histologic varieties. At the same time, it was shown that etidronate did not modify the antineoplastic activity of any of the major chemotherapeutic agents used in these studies, nor did it demonstrate any degree of immunosuppression. The experimental models used for this study should prove useful in evaluating agents that may affect the various types of bone involvement seen in neoplastic disease. The drug's apparent lack of interference with the antineoplastic activity of standard cytotoxic agents and its lack of immunosuppressive activity suggest that it may be readily adaptable to combination chemotherapy regimens.\r"

Serum calcium reverted to normal levels in all patients, with the mean pretreatment serum calcium level of 12.5 +/- 0.4 mg/dl dropping to 9.2 +/- 0.2 mg/dl (p less than 0.01) by Day 7. Elevated urinary calcium (1,107 +/- 134 mg/g creatinine) and hydroxyproline levels (154 +/- 16 mg/g creatinine) declined to 245 +/- 52 mg/g creatinine and 75 +/- 14 mg/g creatinine, respectively, suggesting a marked reduction in bone resorption following treatment. Serum phosphorus levels were unchanged, but urinary phosphorus levels dropped rapidly from 1,181 +/- 125 mg/g creatinine before treatment to 723 +/- 94 mg/g creatinine after two days. Serum parathyroid hormone levels (mid-molecule assay) were suppressed before treatment (64 +/- 16 pg/ml), but rose rapidly to 223 +/- 68 pg/ml by Day 7 of treatment. The value of serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was initially below normal (16 +/- 3 pg/ml), but rose rapidly with treatment to 42 +/- 12 pg/ml by Day 7. Symptoms of hypercalcemia and bone pain improved with treatment, and no serious adverse reactions to treatment were encountered. Intravenous etidronate is apparently an effective and safe treatment for neoplastic hypercalcemia.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous etidronate disodium (etidronate) in controlling hypercalcemia of malignancy, 20 patients with known malignant disease and hypercalcemia were randomly assigned on a two-to-one basis to receive etidronate, 7.5 mg/kg of body weight, or placebo for three to five days. All patients received 3,000 ml of saline and 40 mg of furosemide per day. Eighteen patients completed the study. Eleven of 12 patients (92 percent) in the etidronate group attained normocalcemia, compared with two of six (33 percent) in the placebo group (p = 0.05). The etidronate group showed a greater decrease in the serum calcium level than did the placebo group (p less than 0.02). Renal calcium excretion decreased significantly in the etidronate group but not in the placebo group. Intravenous etidronate in combination with rehydration and furosemide constitutes a safe and effective alternative in the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "The induction of hypercalcemia in malignant disease is almost invariably associated with increased bone resorption. However, tumor-induced changes in bone formation and renal tubular resorption of calcium are also important factors that induce hypercalcemia in some patients. In addition, alterations in calcium fluxes to and from the extracellular fluid secondary to hypercalcemia are important in maintaining or aggravating the hypercalcemic effects of increased bone resorption. These factors significantly affect the responses to treatment of hypercalcemia with inhibitors of bone resorption. This study examined the relative importance of these factors and the effects of intravenous etidronate disodium (etidronate) in neoplastic bone disease with and without hypercalcemia and in Paget's disease of bone. It is concluded that intravenous etidronate is an effective inhibitor of bone resorption, which accounts in large measure for its effects on serum calcium concentrations. These studies of etidronate in hypercalcemia suggest the response is sustained for several weeks.\r"

The dosage for patients with Paget's disease was 4.3 mg/kg/day, infused on each of seven consecutive days. Nine of the 19 patients also received oral etidronate 5 mg/kg/day for three months after administration of intravenous therapy. Etidronate administered orally sustained the decreases in urinary hydroxyproline produced by the infusions, whereas levels returned to pretreatment values in most patients receiving only the intravenously administered drug. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels were not reduced in the 10 patients receiving only intravenously administered etidronate, but they declined by approximately 50 percent in the nine patients who received the additional orally administered etidronate. Transiliac-crest bone biopsy specimens obtained three months after intravenous therapy revealed a regular lamellar structure, compared with the characteristic woven pattern of pagetic bone. In all four patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy, normocalcemia was achieved by the 10th day of treatment using a dosage of 4.3 mg/kg/day. Oral etidronate therapy was beneficial in maintaining normocalcemia.\r"

The control group had releasable t-PA levels of 0.70 +/- 0.10 IU/ml of plasma. Levels of releasable t-PA in the patient population were 0.09 +/- 0.03 IU/ml for those with active vasculitis (p less than 0.0001 compared with the control group by the Student t test), 0.23 +/- 0.12 IU/ml for those with inactive vasculitis (p less than 0.001), and 0.03 +/- 0.01 IU/ml for those with atrophie blanche (p less than 0.0001).

Such a defect may contribute to the pathogenesis of lesions as well as the thromboembolic disease that may be observed in these patients.\r"

These complications include fatty liver, cholestasis, and nonspecific triaditis. The experience with hepatic complications during long-term total parenteral nutrition is also reviewed. Evidence that progressive liver injury develops in some patients requiring lifelong total parenteral nutrition raises a serious dilemma for both patients and physicians. Better understanding of the pathogenesis is required before appropriate treatment can be prescribed.\r"

Elderly men had a higher number of underlying conditions such as atherosclerosis, previous gastrectomy, and malignancy, whereas alcoholism was more prevalent in the younger group. The classic symptoms and signs of tuberculosis were noted in a significantly higher proportion of the younger group: fever (62 percent versus 31 percent), weight loss (76 percent versus 34 percent), night sweats (48 percent versus 6 percent), sputum production (76 percent versus 48 percent), and hemoptysis (40 percent versus 17 percent) (p less than 0.05). Abnormal mentation was more common in the elderly group (31 percent versus 10 percent) (p less than 0.05). Radiographic findings were similar in both groups. Mortality related to tuberculosis was 20 percent in elderly men versus 3 percent in the younger men (p less than 0.05). Tuberculosis is frequently not considered in the differential diagnosis when elderly patients present with multiple medical problems and nonspecific complaints. Since there are differences in the clinical presentation and the outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis in elderly patients, a high index of suspicion for the disease should be maintained.\r"

Five patients are described with Gambian trypanosomiasis treated in Belgium with difluoromethylornithine, using various intravenous and oral dosage schedules. Three patients had late-stage and two had early-stage disease. Difluoromethylornithine treatment was associated with clearing of parasites from blood within one to four days, a trend towards normalization of all altered biologic values associated with the disease, and marked amelioration of clinical symptoms. Side effects of difluoromethylornithine, including loose stools in three patients and both anemia, and a decrease in auditory acuity in one patient, were mild, transient, and never required interruption of drug treatment. The presence of difluoromethylornithine in cerebrospinal fluid, determined in three patients, demonstrated that difluoromethylornithine penetrates into the central nervous system. In three patients, follow-up of at least 24 months after treatment demonstrated a continued healthy state without evidence of relapse. These promising, albeit preliminary, results of difluoromethylornithine therapy, even in patients with central nervous system involvement, indicate that extended clinical trials are warranted to determine the optimal dosage regimen in patients with early- and late-stage disease.\r"

With intermittent chlorambucil and prednisone therapy, the lymphoma was controlled for five years and she had no evidence of cryoglobulinemia. Because of the presence of intractable pulmonary infection and hypogammaglobulinemia G, she was given an intravenous infusion of gamma globulin. Within 72 hours, renal failure and a sustained decrease in serum concentrations of IgM and IgG began concurrently. A kidney biopsy specimen obtained five days after the infusion showed hyaline \"thrombi\" in numerous glomerular capillaries and glomerular necrosis, consistent with acute, severe mixed cryoglobulinemic nephropathy. Immunostaining showed strong positivity for IgM, IgG, and light chains in glomerular capillary lumina and subendothelial sites; immunostaining with a monoclonal antiidiotypic antibody specific for the patient's paraprotein established the presence of the rheumatoid factor paraprotein in the deposits. These observations strongly suggest that complexes consisting of IgM kappa rheumatoid factor, IgG, and complement initiated the renal damage. Therefore, demonstrable serum rheumatoid factor activity in patients with B cell neoplasms should be considered a contraindication to the administration of intravenous gamma globulin.\r"

In an attempt to determine the mechanism of action, serum levels of androstenedione, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol were determined before and after the laparoscopic ovarian cautery in six women with polycystic ovarian disease who had failed to ovulate with clomiphene citrate and human chorionic gonadotropin. Six regularly cycling women undergoing laparoscopy for investigation of infertility or tubal ligation served as controls. In patients with polycystic ovarian disease but not in controls, serum androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol, and luteinizing hormone significantly decreased to nadir levels on postoperative days 3 and 4. In contrast follicle-stimulating hormone levels rose after operation. These results resemble those reported after ovarian wedge resection. Of the six treated women, five ovulated postoperatively and four conceived. Laparoscopic ovarian cautery appears to be a promising alternative treatment for patients with polycystic ovarian disease in whom initial medical management fails.\r"

Each diagnosis-related group is considered a distinct group in which cases are homogeneous with respect to resource consumption. Because the diagnosis-related group system is based primarily on data from community and secondary care hospitals, it does not differentiate sufficiently among high-risk obstetric patients seen at tertiary care institutions, such as Florida's Regional Perinatal Intensive Care Centers. We developed an alternative scheme for diagnosis-related groups, called obstetric care groups, using the federal diagnosis-related groups as the model from which to depart. Data collected for 4192 women during a 2 1/2-year period indicate that obstetric care groups provide more homogeneous groups than diagnosis-related groups for our population of high-risk patients. The obstetric care groups differentiate between no complications, one complication, and two or more complications, while the diagnosis-related groups differentiate only between no complications and one or more complications. Also, complications for obstetric care groups are based on only 19 diagnoses that contribute significantly to resource consumption, while the list of possible complications exceeds 200 for diagnosis-related groups. Although the obstetric care group classification system is simpler than that for diagnosis-related groups, it results in a more accurate reimbursement of hospitalization charges for high-risk obstetric care.\r"

  ".W": "There is a strong association between preterm labor and infection. Some potentially pathogenic bacteria have phospholipase activity, and it has been suggested that release of phospholipase from these organisms may increase prostaglandin E2 synthesis in amnion cells and hence initiate preterm labor. In this study we established monolayer amnion cell cultures from tissue collected at elective cesarean section at term before labor. Cells were prelabeled with tritiated arachidonic acid and then further incubated after addition of 2%, 5%, or 10% (vol/vol) filtered medium in which either group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, or Lactobacillus had been growing. Tritiated arachidonic acid and its metabolites released by the amnion cells in these or control incubates were extracted from culture medium and separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Addition of conditioned medium from each of the organisms with the exception of Lactobacillus caused an increase in overall arachidonic acid metabolism. There was an increase in the ratio of cyclooxygenase to lipoxgenase metabolism and in prostaglandin E2 production in particular when compared to controls. The profile of arachidonic acid metabolism in amnion cells following addition of filtered bacterial medium resembled that obtained from amnion cells cultured following spontaneous labor. We suggest that abnormal bacterial colonization of the genital tract may lead to an increase in arachidonic acid metabolism in amnion cells with an increase in prostaglandin E2 production and the consequent initiation of preterm labor.\r"

  ".W": "Synaptophysin is an integral membrane glycoprotein originally isolated from presynaptic vesicles of bovine neurons. The authors have studied a wide spectrum of neuroendocrine (NE) neoplasms by immunofluorescence microscopy on cryostat sections of freshly frozen tissues using a monoclonal antibody to this protein (SY 38). Without exception, they found the identical--or a very similar--protein expressed in all neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, ganglioneuromas, pheochromocytomas, and paragangliomas studied. In these \"neural\" type NE neoplasms, synaptophysin was coexpressed with neurofilament proteins. Synaptophysin was also demonstrated in NE neoplasms of \"epithelial\" type in which it was predominantly coexpressed with cytokeratins and desmoplakin. It was invariably found in all variants of islet cell neoplasms and in all medullary thyroid carcinomas. Synaptophysin was also demonstrated in several adenomas of the hypophysis and parathyroids, in the majority of carcinoids of the bronchopulmonary and gastrointestinal tracts, and in many, though not all, NE carcinomas of the same sites, and of the skin. Conversely, SY 38 did not immunostain any of a large number of benign and malignant non-NE epithelial neoplasms; nor was any immunostaining obtained in a group of mesenchymal tumors. It is remarkable that SY 38 did not immunostain a number of malignant melanomas, including several that were immunostained for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and several neuropeptides. Parallel studies conducted on conventionally fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections immunostained by the use of the avidin-biotin complex technique yielded very similar results. The findings indicate that synaptophysin is expressed in the whole range of NE neoplasms without detectable relation to the expression of other NE markers such as NSE, serotonin, and neuropeptides. Nor could the expression of synaptophysin by these tumors be correlated with their epithelial and/or neural cytoskeletal characteristics, their clinical aggressiveness, or the presence or absence of endocrinologic abnormalities. While the consistent expression of synaptophysin by the \"neural\" type of NE neoplasms would seem predictable its presence in diverse benign and malignant NE tumors of \"epithelial\" type is remarkable. It is concluded that synaptophysin is a significant as well as novel NE marker, and the use of antibody SY 38 as a broad range marker for the study and diagnosis of NE neoplasms is proposed.\r"

These three polypeptides are integral subunits of the intermediate filaments (IFs) found in normal neurons. Other cell type-specific IF proteins (keratin, desmin, and glial filament polypeptides) are not present in D283 MED cells. Further, the immunocytochemical, immunochemical and ultrastructural data suggest that the neurofilaments in these cells are abnormal, possibly because of a paucity of the low-molecular-weight NF subunit. This is the first human cell line derived from a central nervous system tumor that is capable of expressing all three NF triplet proteins. It is a unique model system for studies of normal and abnormal human NF metabolism as well as for probing the cell biology of medulloblastomas.\r"

Low levels of receptor expression were seen in reactive lymphoid lesions, low-grade B-cell lymphomas, and nonhematopoietic tumors (20%, 7%, and 25% of cases, respectively, with greater than 10% positive cells). High levels of receptor expression were seen in cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and histiocytic proliferations (86% and 100% of cases, respectively, with greater than 10% positive cells). Intermediate levels of expression were seen in Hodgkin's disease (including Reed-Sternberg cells) and some cases of intermediate and high-grade B-cell lymphomas (58% and 50% of cases, respectively, with greater than 10% positive cells). IL-2 receptor expression is not confined to T-cell neoplasia, but is also a feature of neoplastic and nonneoplastic histiocytic proliferations, Hodgkin's disease, and some intermediate and high-grade B-cell lymphomas. Biologic and therapeutic implications are discussed.\r"

Because of this, the authors studied 20 cases of neurofibrosarcoma (NFS), 7 of leiomyosarcoma (LMS), 3 of fibrosarcoma (FS), 8 of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), 5 of monophasic spindle cell synovial sarcoma (MSS), 5 of neurilemmoma, and 5 of neurofibroma for Leu-7 reactivity, to determine its utility in differential diagnosis. Selected examples of each tumor type were also studied ultrastructurally. Leu-7 was compared with the expression of S-100 protein, myelin basic protein, desmin, cytokeratin, and epithelial membrane antigen in the 43 neoplasms. Fifteen examples of NFS, 2 of LMS, and 2 of MSS were Leu-7+; 2 neurofibromas and 4 neurilemmomas also demonstrated reactivity with this antibody. In contrast, all cases of FS and MFH were Leu-7-. Synovial sarcomas could be effectively separated from NFS by reactivities for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen in the former, but not the latter, lesions. However, LMSs and NFSs demonstrated significant immunocytochemical overlap, including shared positivity for S-100, desmin, and myelin basic protein in several cases. These results suggest that Leu-7 has restricted utility in immunohistochemical diagnosis, and must be utilized only in concert with other antigens. Moreover, it would appear that in selected instances, smooth-muscle and neurogenic sarcomas must be separated on the basis of clinical, histopathologic, and ultrastructural features alone.\r"

Further, we produced monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) specific for egg antigens and evaluated their abilities to modulate pulmonary granuloma formation and inhibit soluble egg antigen (SEA)-stimulated lymphocyte blastogenesis. A homogeneous, 140 Kd egg glycoprotein, SJe; 140-GP was nearly as effective as intact eggs in sensitizing for egg-focused pulmonary granuloma formation, while SEA, or the heterogeneous immunoaffinity (IA)-purified C10 antigens were ineffective. The in vivo administration of chronic infection serum (CIS) or Mabs reactive with SJe; 140-GP, to egg-sensitized/egg-challenged mice, modulated pulmonary granuloma formation. Two of these modulatory SJe; 140-GP-specific Mabs (1 A1-1 or 14B3-8), an IgG1, and an IgG3, respectively, did not alter the responses of SEA-stimulated lymph node cells from mice with acute or chronic schistosomiasis japonica. In contrast, another SJe; 140-GP-specific IgG3 Mab (7A6-5), CIS, immunoaffinity purified anti-SEA from CIS, or the non-SEA-binding fraction of CIS, all resulted in dose-related inhibition of SEA-induced proliferation. These data confirm the antibody-driven nature of some immunoregulatory networks in murine schistosomiasis japonica, and extend these observations to include certain Mabs. The immunogenic nature of SJe; 140-GP, and the modulatory and inhibitory activities of Mabs specific for this glycoprotein, indicate it may play a central role in granuloma formation and modulation in this infection.\r"

Spreading depression of cortical activity was used to present a reproducible K+ load to the extracellular space. Baseline [K+]e and the half-time for resolution of the [K+]e changes seen with spreading depression waves were measured for the hypocarbic and normocarbic states by means of double-barrelled K+ microelectrodes placed approximately 400 micron below the cortical surface. Three spreading depression waves were initiated in each animal for the two CO2 states. In group 1 (n = 10), the rats were initially normocarbic (PaCO2 41.6 +/- 3.0 mmHg; mean +/- SD), then hypocarbic (PaCO2 19.0 +/- 2.5 mmHg) for the second series of measurements. The baseline [K+]e was significantly higher in the normocarbic state 3.4 +/- 0.4 versus 3.0 +/- 0.4 mM l-1, P less than 0.01 (paired t test). During normocarbia, the K+ load (delta[K+]e) presented to the extracellular space following spreading depression was 49.4 +/- 7.5 mM l-1, n = 10 (peak [K+]e - baseline [K+]e). The half-time for resolution of the presented [K+]e load was 24.3 +/- 6.1 s. Following hypocarbia of 1.4 +/- 0.6 h, there was no change in delta[K+]e (49.0 +/- 6.0 mM l-1) but resolution t1/2 had increased to 35.8 +/- 11.2 s, P less than 0.01 paired t test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the absence of preexistent myocardial dysfunction, the risk of producing cardiac decompensation in patients being treated with any of the conventional antiarrhythmic agents is low. The availability of disopyramide for clinical use in 1977 produced optimism for an effective antiarrhythmic agent that was free of the well-known immediate and late toxicities of quinidine and procainamide. Unfortunately, shortly after its clinical introduction, reports appeared that raised concern about the negative inotropic actions of disopyramide and the possible role of this drug in precipitating heart failure. In clinical use, the frequency of adverse effects on ventricular function appeared to be out of proportion to disopyramide's greater negative inotropic activity and the contrasting (augmenting) effect on the peripheral vascular resistance compared to that of either quinidine or procainamide, suggesting that the other factors contributed to these observations. Review of the reported literature reveals that certain factors encourage such adverse reactions. These primarily include the routine use of oral and especially intravenous loading dosages of disopyramide in an effort to attain rapid onset of action, the failure to adequately reduce dosages of disopyramide in the setting of compromised renal function, and, most importantly, the use of standard (and even loading) dosages in patients with active heart failure, compromised left ventricular function, or a history of heart failure. The avoidance of loading dosages of disopyramide, adequate reductions of maintenance dosages in the setting of renal insufficiency, gradual dose titration for additional drug action, and omission of patients with decompensated heart failure or significant left ventricular dysfunction should significantly enhance safety in the use of disopyramide.\r"

The reactions were manifested by urticaria, choking, and bronchospasm and were not prevented by pretreatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids. Intradermal skin test with factor VIII was positive. Serum levels of circulating immune complexes were slightly elevated. Persistently low serum C2 levels were consistent with genetic C2 deficiency. These findings suggest the possibility of Type I (IgE mediated) and Type III (immune complex) immunopathogenic mechanisms.

Antigen-induced histamine release was inhibited by approximately 50% in both tissues by prior treatment with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone treatment also inhibited the release of immunoreactive sulfidopeptide leukotriene from parenchymal strips. In tracheal rings, dexamethasone treatment reduced spontaneous release of all cyclooxygenase metabolites (PGE2, PGF2 alpha, TXB2, PGD2, and 6-k-PGF1 alpha were tested), with the exception of PGD2, and also inhibited the antigen-induced release of all cyclooxygenase metabolites studied. Dexamethasone-treatment did not inhibit the spontaneous release of cyclooxygenase metabolites in the guinea pig lung strips, and only modestly inhibited the antigen-induced release of PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and PGD2. The results suggest that the inhibition of contractile response of guinea pig lung strips and airway tissue to antigen by dexamethasone is the result of a reduced release of inflammatory mediators. The inhibition by dexamethasone of antigen-induced release of mast cell mediators from guinea pig lung parenchyma contrasts with results previously obtained with human parenchymal lung tissue.\r"

In order to determine whether the luminal or abluminal surfaces of lung capillary endothelial cells differ with respect to surface charge, we compared the binding of cationic ferritin, an electron dense probe, with these cell surfaces in lung capillaries. Because lung capillaries are not normally permeable to cationic ferritin, lungs were examined from rats with increased permeability edema caused by pretreatment with alpha-naphthylthiourea (ANTU). We found that more cationic ferritin particles bound to the luminal than to the abluminal surfaces of lung capillary endothelium. In order to determine whether this was due to inaccessibility of cationic ferritin to the lung interstitium, we also compared cationic ferritin binding to the apical and basal surfaces of bovine calf aortic and main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells in tissue culture. We found that more cationic ferritin bound to the apical than to the basal surface of the cultured cells. The binding of cationic ferritin to cultured endothelial cells was due to charge since native, anionic ferritin did not bind to either surface and binding was decreased by neuraminidase pretreatment of cultures. Cultures incubated with thiourea, another thiocarbamide that causes increased permeability edema in vivo, also showed greater binding of cationic ferritin to the apical cell surface, suggesting that the differences seen in vivo were not due to thiocarbamide injury. However, another cationic probe, ruthenium red, bound to both the apical and basal surfaces of cultured endothelial cells. These results suggest that the basal endothelial cell surface does not lack anionic sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The administration of chemotherapy by isolated regional perfusion was developed in 1957 at Tulane University and was found to be of greatest benefit for patient with melanoma of the limbs. From 1957 to 1984, 897 patients were treated by this method. The 10-year survival rate for 831 patients with primary melanoma was 77 per cent. Women survived longer than men, with 10-year rates of 81 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively. Prophylactic lymph node dissection was of benefit for males with poor prognosis distal lower limb lesions, but other groups did not benefit. Primary lesions on the arm and thigh did better than lesions of the hand or foot, with plantar and subungual lesions having the least favorable results. Thickness, level, and histologic type were also significant prognostic indicators. Thirty-three patients with locally recurrent melanoma (stage II) treated by perfusion and excision had a 10-year survival rate of 59 per cent. For 129 patients with metastases to the regional lymph nodes (IIIB), perfusion plus RLND produced a 10-year rate of 51 per cent; survival rates for those with a single positive node was 64 per cent. Seventy patients with satellitosis or intransit metastases (IIIA) had a 10-year survival rate of 23 per cent. Thirty-eight patients with metastases to limbs from unknown primaries had a 10-year survival rate of 52 per cent. The overall 10-year rate for all stage III patients was 41 per cent. Perfusion produced useful palliation in 144 patients with limb melanoma in the presence of systemic metastases.\r"

In our study of 60 consecutive patients, we found the frequency of the lupus anticoagulant by Russell viper venom time was 6.7% (95% confidence interval, 16.2 to 1.8) and by anticardiolipin antibody assay was 25% (95% Cl, 37.0 to 15.7), compared with 0% (p = not significant) and 2.5% (p = 0.002), respectively, in the normal control population. The Russell viper venom time (p = 0.0001 by t-test) and anticardiolipin antibody levels (p = 0.01) were significantly associated with presumed thrombotic events (stroke, deep venous thrombosis, and digital gangrene). No association with miscarriage or pulmonary hypertension was detected.

We critically examine the six major arguments used to condemn alkali treatment. We highlight the shortcomings of frequently cited uncontrolled human studies, experiments in animals, and in-vitro chemical analyses not clearly related to the human condition. The damaging hemodynamic effects of acidemia, which centralizes blood volume while depressing myocardial contraction (thereby causing hemodynamic collapse), are discussed and offered in support of alkali therapy. We also emphasize the extreme sensitivity of patients with acidosis to further small decreases in serum bicarbonate concentration or increases in arterial PCO2. In short, we have found no basis by which to condemn the use of alkali and believe that those who have scorned its use have yet to demonstrate its danger clearly. Until that time, sodium bicarbonate should remain the standard of therapy for this life-threatening condition.\r"

Functional disturbances seen on FDG-PET did not always correlate with abnormalities revealed by x-ray computed tomographic scan. This classification of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome into four major metabolic subtypes not only provides a new perspective toward understanding cerebral function in this complex syndrome, but may also prove useful in the clinical management of these patients.\r"

Group 3 received the emulsion at a constant rate of 4 g/kg a day over 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of free fatty acids and serum concentrations of total bilirubin, apparent unbound bilirubin, and albumin were measured at regular intervals. Effects of the three regimens on serum bilirubin measurements were determined. The regimen of fat infusion and rate of infusion seemed to have no effect on serum concentrations of total and apparent unbound bilirubin, although there was a trend towards greater variability in apparent unbound concentrations with the intermittent regimen.\r"

  ".W": "Rates of whole body protein synthesis and catabolism in normal volunteers and in a group of severely septic patients were isotopically determined. In addition, the effect in the patients of either glucose infusion or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on protein dynamics was assessed. The basal rate of net protein catabolism (NPC) was significantly higher in the septic patients than in the volunteers (p less than 0.05). The values obtained in the volunteers and patients were 1.44 +/- 0.18 and 2.20 +/- 0.10 g/kg/day, respectively. This increase in NPC was primarily due to a major increase in whole body catabolism that was partially counteracted by a modest increase in protein synthesis. When the patients were infused with glucose (4 mg/kg/min), NPC decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) to 1.96 +/- 0.08 g/kg/day, and during TPN the value was significantly lower again (p less than 0.04) (0.63 +/- 0.28 g/kg/day). In each instance the conservation of host tissue was due to an increase in protein synthesis: the accelerated rate of whole body protein catabolism continued irrespective of the nutritional status. The following conclusions were reached from these data: severely ill septic patients have an accelerated rate of NPC compared with normal volunteers, and this is primarily due to a large increase in whole body protein catabolism; TPN is an effective means of conserving host tissue in severely septic patients via the promotion of whole body protein synthesis; despite the beneficial effect of TPN in these patients, whole body protein catabolism continues unabated, and as a result, protein losses still occur at approximately one fourth the rate seen in the absence of TPN; and there is no obvious advantage in terms of protein-sparing when protein is provided in amounts exceeding 1.5 g/kg/day.\r"

  ".U": "87155540\r", 
  ".W": "In 1942, 53% of medically treated patients with cirrhosis were dead 6 months after the onset of ascites. Only 30% survived 1 year. This dismal outlook has improved only slightly with advances in medicine. Yet, some internists reject the peritoneovenous shunt (PVS) for this fatal condition even if they are aware that a diminished blood volume causes the abnormal sodium retention responsible for ascites. Their objections are based on life-threatening complications of PVS, especially post shunt coagulopathy (PSC). Blood shed into the peritoneal cavity becomes incoagulable. Such blood is immediately coagulated by a protocoagulant (soluble collagen) and concurrently lysed by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) secreted by the peritoneal serosa. Wide zones of lysis surround peritoneal tissue placed on fibrin plates. Large volumes of ascitic fluid infused into circulating blood simulates the fate of blood shed into the peritoneal cavity with lysis playing the major role. Addition of ascitic fluid to normal platelet-rich plasma in vitro initiates clot lysis on thromboelastogram (TEG). Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) counteracts this lysis. EACA and clotting factors normalize the TEG and arrest PSC. Disposal of ascitic fluid at surgery prevents or ameliorates PSC. Mild PSC was encountered only twice in 150+ consecutive patients (1.3%) with only one case being clinically significant (0.6%). Severe PSC occurred seven times in 98 early shunt patients whose ascitic fluid was not discarded. Severe PSC requires shunt interruption and control of bleeding with clotting factors and EACA. Peritoneal lavage with saline prevents the recurrence of PSC on reopening the shunt. In four patients, EACA and clotting factors were adequate to arrest coagulopathy. Three earlier patients died of PSC before its cause and treatment were understood. Proper management eliminates this life-threatening complication, and PSC cannot be considered a deterrent to PVS. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is produced in experimental animals only by the injection of thrombin or thromboplastin. PSC is a distinct entity differing from DIC; EACA and not heparin is the antidote for PSC.\r"

Multivariate analysis identified four parameters that significantly predicted endocarditis in staphylococcemic patients at time of initial evaluation: absence of a primary site of infection; community acquisition of infection; metastatic sequelae; and valvular vegetations detected by echocardiography. Echocardiography was most predictive of endocarditis in patients with community-acquired S aureus bacteremia from an obvious primary focus. In 11 (69%) of 16 patients with endocarditis and vegetations on two-dimensional echocardiography, this technique also revealed other important findings, including ventricular dilatation, and/or underlying valvular lesions. In 18% of patients with S aureus bacteremia without stigmata of endocarditis, echocardiography provided information that led to a diagnosis of endocarditis and a subsequent change in therapy. Our findings support the routine use of two-dimensional echocardiography in all cases of community-acquired S aureus bacteremia to identify occult endocarditis in patients without classic stigmata of disease, and to provide important prognostic data in clinically apparent endocarditis.\r"

Porphyrin precursors, urine levels of lead, and results from an edetic acid-provocative test gave poor diagnostic information and low correlation values with lead levels in blood. However, erythrocyte delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity showed a closer correlation with lead levels in blood, although we observed a frequent overlap of results in severe cases.

  ".W": "The efficacy of lithium carbonate as a treatment for alcoholism was examined in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 104 men and women meeting DSM-III criteria for alcohol dependence. Subjects entered the study during inpatient treatment and were subsequently followed up for 12 months. Survival analysis disclosed essentially three categories of treatment response: one for noncompliant subjects (0% to 7% abstinent), one for compliant subjects not attaining therapeutic serum lithium levels (31% to 44% abstinent), and one for compliant subjects with therapeutic serum levels (67% abstinent). Two findings led us to believe that therapeutic serum levels of lithium were associated with better outcome over and above a behavioral compliance effect. First, in a dose-response analysis, serum lithium levels and abstinence rates were not linearly associated. Second, all subjects who started lithium carbonate therapy as inpatients were significantly less likely to relapse to drinking during the first month than were placebo-compliant subjects. There was no evidence that depressed alcoholics showed a better treatment response than nondepressed alcoholics or that lithium had any significant impact on the mood or social adjustment of alcoholics. Although the sample size and the difficulties of ascertaining placebo compliance caution against drawing firm conclusions, the data add further support to the hypothesis that lithium has an effect on drinking behavior not related to the treatment of affective symptoms.\r"

The enzyme was also demonstrated in normal and metaplastic intestinal absorptive cells, and in gastric adenocarcinoma of the usual and superficial types. The enzyme was normally absent in antral and Brunner's glands, normal and metaplastic goblet cells, and signet ring tumor cells. Gastritis and duodenitis were associated with a decrease in the staining intensity of the enzyme in surface epithelial cells, suggesting a possible decreased enzyme activity, which may enhance the risk for peptic ulceration in susceptible persons.\r"

Only the two cases of interdigitating reticulum cell lymphoma and two of the 12 cases of histiocytosis X exhibited significant EMA positivity.

Plasma and peritoneal fluid glucose, amino acid, and electrolyte concentrations and osmolarities were measured serially for six hours following infusion, and nutrient absorptions were calculated. Plasma osmolarity rose minimally, peritoneal fluid osmolarity declined rapidly, and there was a small increase in peritoneal fluid volume. Peritoneal fluid concentrations of glucose and amino acids fell precipitously during the initial two hours, while plasma concentrations rose in reciprocal fashion. Two thirds of the glucose and 83% of the amino acid loads were absorbed at six hours, with most of the absorption occurring within the first two hours. Amino acid absorption was independent of molecular weight and configuration. While glucose and amino acids were rapidly absorbed in adequate amounts, an intraperitoneal nutrition support system will require fat to provide total energy needs.\r"

A possible hypothetical relationship between psychosis and epilepsy regarding the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and kindling of this system with epileptic discharge in temporal-limbic circuits could induce a florid psychotic state in some patients. This biochemical relationship to schizophrenia with heightened dopamine activity would also easily explain the amelioration of acute psychotic activity in our seven patients with neuroleptic agents and their antagonism of this increased dopaminergic outflow state.\r"

The high frequency of virulent Bacillus infections in the setting of trauma necessitates the use of antibiotics that are active against this organism in posttraumatic endophthalmitis. The combination of clindamycin and gentamicin can be effective therapy in Bacillus species infections if used early in the course of the disease.\r"

To determine the role of the lipoxygenase and cyclo-oxygenase products of arachidonic acid in the modulation of granulomatous uveitis, one group of experimental animals was treated with nafazatrom, while another group was treated with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (lipoxygenase inhibitors). Both resulted in significant attenuation of granulomatous inflammation, with reduced giant-cell infiltration into the choroid. In contrast, indomethacin (a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor) therapy resulted in increased giant-cell formation. These findings suggest that the lipoxygenase and cyclo-oxygenase products of arachidonic acid play a role in the development of granulomatous uveitis and that such inflammation can be selectively suppressed by lipoxygenase inhibitors.\r"

No arrhythmias were seen during insufflation and surgical conditions in all groups were good. Spontaneous respiration via a face mask did not lead to significant hypercarbia, acidosis or cardiac arrhythmia. A high incidence of minor morbidity was found in all groups.

Because of the slow response of the infra-red carbon dioxide analyser, satisfactory recordings of end-tidal carbon dioxide could not be obtained at frequencies greater than 1 Hz. The interruption of high frequency jet ventilation by conventional ventilation resulted in approximately equal arterial and end-tidal PCO2 values during the first breath, and restoration of the normal arterial to end-tidal PCO2 difference by the third breath. It is concluded that, when high frequency jet ventilation at 1, 3 or 5 Hz is interrupted with normal tidal volumes at low frequencies, the arterial PCO2 can be estimated from recordings of the end-tidal PCO2.\r"

In those 15 women, mean serum prolactin levels during the mid-follicular and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle were 29.8 (SEM 1.8) ng/ml and 29.5 (SEM 1.3) ng/ml, respectively. Although serum FSH and LH levels were similar in normal and hyperprolactinaemic women, serum oestradiol level during the mid-follicular phase was subnormal in hyperprolactinaemic women (P less than 0.05). In contrast, serum oestradiol and progesterone levels during the mid-luteal phase and luteal phase length were similar in normoprolactinaemic and hyperprolactinaemic groups. The results suggest that hyperprolactinaemia is associated with defects of follicle development as measured by oestradiol production during the mid-follicular phase, but not with corpus luteum function as measured by progesterone production during the mid-luteal phase, and luteal phase length.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms of sensitization and attachment of drug-dependent antibodies to RBC in drug-induced immune hemolytic anemias are largely speculative. Nomifensine has been incriminated in causing immune hemolysis in a large number of patients. The hemolysis was usually of the so-called immune complex type, less commonly of the autoimmune type, and more surprisingly, few patients had developed both types of hemolysis. To determine whether nomifensine (metabolite)-dependent antibodies (ndab) exhibit specificity for antigenic structures of RBC membranes, 30 ndab were tested against large panels of RBC with common and rare antigens. We found that only 14 out of 30 ndab were invariably reactive with all cells tested. Nine antibodies were, similar to the majority of idiopathic or drug-induced autoantibodies, not or only weakly reactive with Rhnull RBC. Three antibodies did not react with cord RBC and could be inhibited by soluble I antigen. The remaining four antibodies gave inhomogeneous reaction patterns or were even negative with selected RBC; their specificity could not be identified. On a Scatchard plot analysis of one ndab, a maximum of 173,000 drug-dependent antibodies of the IgG class can specifically bind per RBC in the presence of the drug. Although nomifensine and its metabolites do not attach tightly onto RBC, our results clearly indicate that RBC do not act as \"innocent bystanders,\" but rather serve as a surface for a loose attachment of drugs that possibly cause a subtle structural change in the cell antigens and, by this means, allow in vivo sensitization; and a specific binding of the resultant antibodies. This concept would explain why these antibodies can be directed against drug-cell complexes, against cell antigens alone (autoantibodies), or against both in the same patient.\r"

In a variable number of cases SmIg are not detectable because of their low density on the cellular surface. Because a constant presence of CyIg in 20 subjects suffering from B-CLL has been reported recently, we reexamined 15 SmIg-negative and 10 SmIg-positive B-CLL patients by SmIg and CyIg determinations. We used a direct immunofluorescence method on peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the detection of SmIg and, after fixation, for CyIg. CyIg were detectable in 24 out of 25 cases, with a fluorescence intensity ranging from weak to moderate. The existence of frequent negative results for CyIg determination in B-CLL reported in the literature probably depends on the low sensitivity of the method used. We conclude that CyIg determination is useful in phenotyping every B-CLL patient, especially SmIg-negative ones.\r"

Rearrangements of the T cell receptor beta and gamma genes appear concurrently and are preceded by surface expression of the 3A1 (CD7) molecule. Subsequent transcription of the beta gene is coordinated with surface expression of T1 (CD5) and T11 (CD2), transcription of T3 delta mRNA, and the appearance of intracellular T3 (CD3) protein. As late events, T alpha gene transcripts appear and, finally, T3, the multichain complex linked to the T cell receptor, is presented on the cell surface. Findings reported here provide a model of the developmental orchestration of genes encoding antigen recognition in human T cells.\r"

In the absence of myeloid markers, strong positivity for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and reactivity with T cell antibody 3A1, but lack of more mature T cell antigens, provided evidence for immature T cell differentiation. Molecular analysis of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) in chromosome 22 revealed a rearrangement and thus confirmed the CML origin of the early T cell blasts. T cell receptor beta chain sequences were found in germline configuration and therefore suggest a very immature stage of T cell differentiation in the CML blasts.\r"

Most patients responded badly to aggressive therapy. Progression is presently noted in one patient; five patients died 10, 11, 13, 18, and 22 months after diagnosis. No patient developed leukemia. The tumors were highly proliferative, had a diffuse growth pattern, and comprised clear cells of variable size. They could not be classified histologically, but could, however, be immunohistologically characterized as B cell lymphomas. In all cases, the immunophenotype was LC+, cALLa-, CD19+, CD20+, CD21-, Ig (surface/cytoplasm)-, and PC-1+. In addition, the neoplastic cells exhibited variable defects in the expression of HLA-A,B,C and HLA-DR and inconstant expression of other B cell-restricted/associated antigens. This combination of immunophenotypical and clinical features suggests that the mediastinal clear cell lymphoma (MCCL) is a previously undescribed type of B cell lymphoma corresponding to the terminal steps of B cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that structural changes in DNA, including the ligation of pre-existing DNA breaks and the opening and closure of new breaks, occur shortly after exposure of granulomonocytic precursors (CFU-GM) to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating activity (GM-CSA). Monocytic differentiation of CFU-GM is selectively inhibited by compounds known to inhibit the nuclear enzyme ADP-ribosyl transferase (ADPRT). Since this enzyme, which transfers ADP-ribose units to chromatin proteins, is known to activate DNA ligase, we attempted to determine whether ligation of one or both types of DNA break is required for monocytic differentiation. Breaks in DNA were examined using the nucleoid sedimentation technique in which DNA breaks cause loss of DNA supercoiling in nucleoids and concomitant changes in their sedimentation through neutral sucrose gradients. We here report that two distinct patterns of DNA strand breakage and ligation are associated with differentiation to the granulocyte and monocyte lineages. Monocytic inducers (phorbolester and vitamin D3) predominantly produce closure of pre-existing strand breaks, whereas granulocytic inducers (granulocyte colony stimulating activity, G-CSA; retinoic acid) cause opening and closure of new breaks. Only ligation of the pre-existing breaks is highly sensitive to inhibition by 3-methoxybenzamide (a potent ADPRT inhibitor), and only monocytic differentiation is impaired by addition of this compound. These findings suggest that DNA structural changes may be directly involved in granulocyte-macrophage switching.\r"

A short (one-hour) treatment of normal Mo with F VIII concentrates led to a significant (P less than 0.001) down modulation of Fc receptors expressed in the Mo plasma membrane. This down modulation was accompanied by a decrease of Mo effector functions that was expressed by a reduced capacity of F VIII-treated Mo to release O2 radicals (40% of controls) and to kill bacteria (% killing: control Mo, 65%; F VIII-treated Mo, 24% to 51%). Further studies showed that the modulating activity was due to a contaminant present in F VIII concentrates (immune complexes or IgG aggregates). Fractionation using molecular sieving revealed that the modulatory activity was confined to a high-molecular range fraction (Mr greater than 1,270,000 daltons), while the fraction containing monomeric IgG had no effect. Further fractionation by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose separated the coagulation activity (effluent) from the Mo function-modulating activity (eluate). We conclude that treatment with F VIII concentrates might contribute to an immunocompromised state in some hemophiliacs and facilitate opportunistic infections in these patients.\r"

The colony-stimulating factor (CSA) used in our experiments was found to contain IL2. IL2 depletion from CSA resulted in a reduction in CFU-C colony proliferation. Addition of exogenous IL2 caused an increase in CFU-C colony numbers in a dose-dependent manner. This increase could be prevented by anti-Tac, a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to the IL2 receptor. Moreover, anti-Tac in the absence of exogenous IL2 resulted in an overall decrease in colony numbers. Depletion of either adherent cells or T lymphocytes abolished the effect of IL2 and anti-Tac on colony growth. In the presence of IL2, re-addition of T lymphocytes to the T-depleted marrow or adherent cells to adherent cell-depleted marrow resulted in a significant increase in CFU-C colony numbers, whereas no significant effect was found when IL2-depleted CSA was used. Although T lymphocytes were not themselves essential for CFU-C colony growth, our studies indicate that IL2 and IL2-responsive T cells can regulate in vitro granulopoiesis.\r"

Using an anti IL2 receptor monoclonal antibody (McAb aIL2r) in indirect immunofluorescence we found significant proportions (42.2% +/- 19.7 SD) of the CML cells (previously depleted of E rosetting T cells) to be IL2 receptor positive following incubation in suspension for 18 hours at 37 degrees C. Noninduced cells did not express IL2 receptors. After induction the aIL2r positive and negative cell subpopulations were sorted and analyzed separately for morphology, lineage specific cell surface markers, and clonogenic cell numbers. The IL2 receptor positive CML subpopulations mainly contained blast cells and monocytes and revealed reactivity with myeloid McAbs but not with T cell, B cell, platelet, or erythroid markers. Clonogenic cells (CFU-GEMM, BFUe, and CFU-GM) were selectively recovered from aIL2r positive CML cells and thus were IL2 receptor positive. The addition of recombinant IL2 (rIL2) to CFU-GM and BFUe cultures, in concentrations from 50 to 500 U/mL, did not influence the efficiency of colony formation. Binding of a radiolabeled IL2 preparation to the in vitro activated CML cells indicated the presence of low affinity receptors for IL2. In contrast to CML, normal human marrow cells were consistently aIL2r nonreactive. Thus, IL2 receptor inducibility is a characteristic feature of CML clonogenic cells, which they share with AML, but not with normal marrow progenitors. The role of IL2 receptors in the regulation of proliferation of CML cells requires further investigation.\r"

Tannic acid has been used in the present study as an electron-dense stain to follow the secretory process in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that tannic acid precipitates fibrinogen, and binds osmium tetroxide to fibrinogen and fibrin strands. Examination of platelets fixed at short intervals after exposure to thrombin and incubated in solutions containing tannic acid revealed electron-dense deposits of osmium not apparent in resting platelets. Granules and lumina of channels making up the open canalicular system (OCS) were unstained in discoid cells. However, exposure to thrombin at concentrations of 1 to 5 U/mL for thirty seconds or more resulted in intense staining of alpha granules by osmium. Some granules communicated directly with dilated channels of the OCS, and several were frequently connected to the same canaliculus. The electron-dense substance in swollen granules and channels appeared to be in the process of extrusion through narrow or dilated openings of the OCS onto the platelet surface. Granule-to-granule fusion and formation of sealed vacuoles of fused granule products unstained by tannic acid-osmium were not observed. The findings support the concept that secretion by stimulated human platelets results from development of direct communications between granules and channels of the OCS and subsequent extrusion of products through channel pores to the surrounding medium.\r"

Similarly, natural or antibody-mediated cytotoxic activities fluctuated in vivo and in vitro. Cells from the patient with T3- T8+ proliferation were able to inhibit directly the growth of early CFU-GM, CFU-E, and BFU-E and to a lesser extent of late CFU-GM, as shown by cultures of autologous blood or marrow progenitors after depletion (and subsequent addition) of granular cells. In the other six patients with T3+ T8+ cells, no such effect was found. However, after a 24-hour incubation of the progenitors with the granular cells, CFU-GM growth was clearly inhibited; this was not observed in all experiments, a finding which may be related to the spontaneous variations of cell killer functions. Finally, no correlation was noted between the clinical course or extent of lymphoid proliferation and cell function or phenotype or with the monoclonal (two cases), polyclonal (three cases) or germ-line (one case) patterns of T cell receptor beta gene configuration.\r"

Cells simultaneously expressing both monocyte/macrophage phenotype (typically induced by TNF) and granulocyte characteristics (typically induced by RA) are induced by a combination of the two factors, indicating that TNF and RA potentiate each other's activity. The results obtained using immune interferon (IFN-gamma) in combination with the two inducers suggest that the mechanism of action of TNF and IFN-gamma are possibly different. The inhibitory effect of RA on the expression of HLA class I antigens and of the high-affinity Fc receptor is potentiated by TNF but completely reversed by rIFN-gamma.\r"

Cytofluorometric analysis and immunoprecipitation were performed using murine monoclonal antibodies specific for HLA-DR (L-243) and HLA-DQ (Leu 10). The expression of mRNA for HLA-DR and HLA-DQ chains was determined by Northern blot and RNA dot-blot analysis. Lymphoid cell lines expressed both HLA-DR and HLA-DQ antigens, with consistently higher levels of expression of DR. Myeloid cell lines of early myeloblast or bipotent (myeloid-erythroid) phenotype (KG-1, KG-1a, HEL) expressed HLA-DR at high levels, whereas cell lines manifesting a greater degree of myeloid maturation (ML-3, HL-60, U937) expressed DR at low or undetectable levels. The HLA-DQ antigen was expressed at low levels on the surface of KG-1 and KG-1a cells but was not detectable on other myeloid cell lines. The expression of mRNA for HLA-DR and HLA-DQ chains paralleled the pattern of expression of the respective antigens. The HL-60 and U-937 cells stimulated to differentiate in vitro to macrophages with 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] were induced to express detectable levels of HLA-DR antigens. Exposure to gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) increased the expression of HLA-DR antigens by all myeloid cell lines. Induction of differentiation in vitro with either 1,25(OH)2D3 or dimethyl sulfoxide potentiated this effect of gamma-IFN. Expression of the HLA-DQ antigens was increased on KG-1 myeloblasts after exposure to gamma-IFN. HLA-DQ expression could not be detected on other myeloid cell lines after exposure to gamma-IFN, nor was HLA-DQ expression stimulated by gamma-IFN after HL-60 and U-937 cells were induced to differentiate to macrophagelike cells in vitro. These results provide additional evidence that expression of the HLA-DR and HLA-DQ genes may be independently regulated in human myeloid cells.\r"

Our original results showed that five of eight samples contained a mutation in codon 13 of the N-ras gene. In a subsequent study involving 37 samples, we found only one N-ras-13 mutation, and, in addition, mutations in codon 61 of the N-ras gene in four cases and a mutation in codon 12 of the Ki-ras gene in two cases. Amplification of ras genes was not observed. We conclude that in approximately 20% to 25% of AML cases, a mutated ras oncogene is present, predominantly the N-ras gene. The occurrence of mutations does not correlate with the cytological features of the leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of circulating tumor idiotype interferes with the in vivo effectiveness of anti-idiotype antibodies. We developed two assays that permit identification of patients with high levels of serum idiotype without the need for first producing an anti-idiotype antibody. A cell suspension made from the tumor was cultured for seven days with or without phytohemagglutin (PHA) and/or phorbol myristic acetate (PMA). Ig secretion in vitro by patients' tumor cells varied. In 4 patients, no secretion in vitro occurred, 5 patients had low levels, and 5 patients had high levels of Ig secretion. In three patients, Ig secretion occurred only after stimulation with PHA, PMA, or both. Spontaneous or induced immunoglobulin secretion in vitro is related to the levels of tumor idiotype secretion that exist in vivo. Eight patients with serum idiotype levels greater than 100 micrograms/mL (mean 265 micrograms/mL), had a minimum of 1.0 microgram/10(6) cells of idiotype secretion in vitro. Nine patients with serum idiotype levels less than 30 micrograms/mL (mean 3.7 micrograms/mL), had less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/10(6) cells of idiotype secretion in vitro. In another assay, the levels of IgM kappa and IgM lambda in patients' sera were compared with those in normal serum. An imbalance in the relative amounts of IgM kappa and IgM lambda indicated high levels of circulating idiotype in the serum, but this assay was less sensitive than the in vitro secretion assay and limited to IgM-secreting tumors. These assays will be useful for future clinical studies using anti-idiotype antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "A new Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive cell line, designated TOM-1, was derived from bone marrow cells of a patient with Ph1-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The TOM-1 cells were positive for Ia and B1 antigens and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) but negative for common ALL antigen. Although neither surface Ig nor cytoplasmic Ig was detected, the TOM-1 cells contained rearranged immunoglobulin-H chain genes but retained germ-line kappa chain and germ-line T cell receptor beta-chain genes. These results indicate that the TOM-1 cells reside as the progenitor of pre-B cells. We have investigated the chromosome 22 breakpoint and c-abl gene expression in the TOM-1 cells. We found that the breakpoint on chromosome 22 was within the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) in the TOM-1 cells. We also found the breakpoints within or near bcr in four of six Ph1-positive ALL cases, similar to the findings in Ph1-positive CML cases. Amplification of the c-abl gene was not detected in the TOM-1 cells. The leukemic cells isolated from a patient with CML in myeloid crisis contained a novel 8-kilobase (kb) abl-related messenger RNA (mRNA), but the TOM-1 cells contained c-abl transcripts of only normal sizes, despite the fact that they showed the bcr gene rearrangement.\r"

In the control group there was a small but significant reduction in fasting blood glucose concentration but overall glucose tolerance and hormone concentrations were unaffected. In contrast, the patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus showed a significant improvement in their glucose tolerance, which paralleled the severity of their diabetes. This response seems to reflect decreased degradation of insulin rather than increased pancreatic output. These observations suggest that treatment with chloroquine or suitable analogues may be a new approach to the management of diabetes.\r"

The serum calcium concentrations decreased significantly after treatment with aminohydroxypropylidene diphosphonate. Ten patients became normocalcaemic (normal range, adjusted for serum albumin, 2.25-2.75 mmol/l), two became hypocalcaemic, three showed decreases in serum calcium concentrations of more than 0.75 mmol/l, and one showed a decrease of more than 0.55 mmol/l. Only one patient had a minimum concentration greater than 2.77 mmol/l. Aminohydroxypropylidene diphosphonate was effective in metastatic and non-metastatic hypercalcaemia, and its hypocalcaemic effect was prolonged in some cases. There were no appreciable side effects. Single high dose infusions of aminohydroxypropylidene diphosphonate could replace conventional daily lower dose infusions, but the optimum frequency of high dose infusions remains to be determined.\r"

In group 1 endoscopic stone clearance was successful in 50 patients (91%); five of these patients refused elective surgery, though this was subsequently necessary in one. In group 2 common bile duct stones were cleared surgically in 54 of 59 patients (91.5%); one patient was treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy alone because of a myocardial infarct. The overall major complication rate in group 1 was 16.4% and included two deaths; in group 2 this was 8.5% and included one death. The minor complication rate in group 1 was 16.4% and that in group 2 13.6%. These differences in outcome were not significant. Despite a significant reduction in total hospital stay of patients in group 1, these results do not support the routine use of preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy in patients having biliary surgery for stones in the common bile duct.\r"

Death was judged unavoidable in 19 patients who seemed to have precipitous attacks despite apparently good long term management. Delays in seeking medical help because of overreliance on beta agonist delivered by nebuliser were evident in 12 cases and possible in a further 11, but these represented only 8% of the 271 verified deaths from asthma in New Zealanders aged under 70 during the period. Evidence for direct toxicity of high dose beta agonist was not found. Nevertheless, the absence of serum potassium and theophylline concentrations and of electrocardiographic monitoring in the period immediately preceding death precluded firm conclusions whether arrhythmias might have occurred due to these factors rather than to hypoxia alone. In most patients prescribed domiciliary nebulisers death was associated with deficiencies in long term and short term care similar to those seen in patients without nebulisers. Discretion in prescribing home nebulisers, greater use of other appropriate drugs, including adequate corticosteroids, and careful supervision and instruction of patients taking beta agonist by nebuliser should help to reduce the mortality from asthma.\r"

Most referrals were for soft collars (44%), lumbar sacral supports (30%), and dorsilumbar supports (7%). Thirty eight patients failed to attend, 54 declined an appliance, and four referrals were considered to be inappropriate. A few patients were subsequently referred to consultant outpatient clinics, 22 for physiotherapy and 34 were referred simultaneously to the open access clinic. The referral rates for general practitioners with access to community hospitals were low. Such an arrangement merits wider consideration.\r"

Local recurrence rates varied greatly with the disease site, being low after axillary (3%) and perianal surgery (0%) and high after inguinoperineal (37%) and submammary (50%) excision. Recurrence results from inadequate excision or an unusually wide distribution of apocrine glands, but physical factors such as obesity, local pressure, and skin maceration played a part in a few patients. Recurrence due to inadequate surgery tended to be the most troublesome. At follow up 75 (91%) of the patients were pleased with the results of their operation. A quarter of the patients developed disease at a new anatomical site after operation. Radical surgery gives good symptomatic control of severe hidradenitis suppurativa of the axilla, inguinoperineal, and perianal regions but is less satisfactory for submammary disease.\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen unselected patients who had essential hypertension and whose average supine blood pressure when they were not receiving any treatment and their usual sodium intake was 162/107 mm Hg were treated with captopril 50 mg twice daily. After one month's treatment their supine blood pressure had decreased to 149/94 mm Hg. They were then instructed to reduce their sodium intake to about 80 mmol(mEq)/day. After two weeks of moderate sodium restriction they were entered into a double blind randomised crossover study comparing the effect of 10 Slow Sodium tablets (100 mmol sodium chloride) with matching placebo tablets while continuing to take captopril and restrict sodium in their diet. After one month of taking placebo their mean supine blood pressure was 137/88 mm Hg with a urinary sodium excretion of 83 mmol/24 h, while after one month of taking Slow Sodium tablets their mean supine blood pressure was 150/97 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) with a sodium excretion of 183 mmol/24 h. The mean supine blood pressure during moderate sodium restriction therefore decreased by 9% and correlated significantly with the reduction in urinary sodium excretion. These results suggest that the combination of treatment with a moderate but practical reduction in sodium intake and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is effective in decreasing the blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. This combined approach overcomes some of the objections that have been made to salt restriction alone and to converting enzyme inhibitors alone.\r"

Further studies are necessary to identify other regions of the cerebral cortex that are selectively damaged in brain damage associated with alcohol.\r"

Six hundred and two (98%) of the population studied showed evidence of current or previous infection. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen was 31% (188/615) and of the e antigen was 9% (58/615). Infection was acquired early in life, and the prevalence of both antigens declined with age. The rates of infection were similar in all age groups examined (0-70) including early childhood. Both hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen were detected in exudates from tropical ulcers, which may be a source of environmental hepatitis B. Concordance of antigen presence was higher in pairs of siblings than in mother-child pairs. All Gilbertese children should receive hepatitis B vaccine at birth or soon after if the long term consequences of hepatitis B infection are to be minimised.\r"

  ".W": "The mental state of 211 women attending a urodynamic clinic was assessed using questionnaires. Patients with genuine stress incontinence had scores comparable with other patients with longstanding physical complaints. Patients with sensory urgency were more anxious than those with genuine stress incontinence. Patients with detrusor instability were as anxious as patients with sensory urgency and in addition had higher scores on the hysteria scale. A subset of patients (roughly a quarter of the total) was identified, comprising members of all three diagnostic groups, for whom urinary symptoms rendered life intolerable. These patients were as anxious, depressed, and phobic as psychiatric inpatients, emphasising the serious psychological morbidity experienced by patients with urinary symptoms. Fifty patients with detrusor instability or sensory urgency entered a randomised trial comparing psychotherapy, bladder drill, and propantheline. The psychotherapy group significantly improved on measures of urgency, incontinence, and nocturia, though not on frequency. Bladder training was an effective treatment for frequency and patients became less anxious and depressed. There was a modest improvement in frequency of micturition in patients given propantheline. Frequency may be a learnt disorder which responds to the direct symptom oriented approach of bladder training. Patients with urgency and nocturia predominating might derive more benefit from psychotherapy.\r"
