In recent years it has become clear that a variety of hormones are present in the heart and may participate in the genesis of left ventricular hypertrophy. Our group has demonstrated the synthesis of renin by cultured canine arterial smooth muscle cells and has recently demonstrated the presence of renin and angiotensin II in myocardial cell preparations. Angiotensin II concentration was (+/- standard error of the mean) 4.19 +/- 1.52 pg/10(6) cells. Evidence has been developed to suggest that these components of the renin-angiotensin system are modulatable. These data, taken together with studies from our laboratory and others, raise the distinct possibility that components of the renin-angiotensin system together with catecholamines play a role in the genesis of left ventricular hypertrophy. Recent evidence suggests that the myc proto-oncogene is activated in cells undergoing catecholamine-induced hypertrophy and our laboratory has detected activation of the sis proto-oncogene in at least 1 model of left ventricular hypertrophy. These findings raise the possibility that similar pathogenetic cellular mechanisms operate to produce myocardial hypertrophy, vascular hyperplasia and hypertrophy, and some forms of benign neoplasia. The possible significance of these findings and their relation to peptide hormones and growth factors are discussed.\r"

Although individual patient considerations, such as associated illnesses and potential side effects, are of primary importance in choosing therapy, the influence of demographic factors has received increasing attention. The effect of age, race and gender on the response to antihypertensive therapy will be examined. Several studies have indicated that the beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are more effective in younger than in older patients. Conversely, there is a trend toward greater responses in older subjects to the diuretics and calcium antagonists. In the few studies available that have compared agents in various classes, it appears that diuretics, and probably calcium antagonists, are significantly more effective than beta blockers or ACE inhibitors in patients over 60 years of age. However, the interdrug differences in young patients are probably less important. With regard to race, the relative lack of effect of beta blockers and ACE inhibitors in blacks is well accepted; in comparative studies, diuretics proved significantly better. From the few available studies, it does not appear that the calcium antagonists are more potent in either racial group, but they may be superior to the beta blockers and ACE inhibitors in blacks. Far less information is available concerning differences in antihypertensive responses between men and women. There is some suggestion that women may be less responsive to beta blockers than men.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A better understanding of the strain pattern in patients with LV hypertrophy has arisen from experimental animal studies showing how an increase in cardiac mass can lead to myocardial ischemia and from clinical studies showing that the patient with LV hypertrophy and strain is at risk from myocardial ischemia as a consequence of both associated coronary artery disease and increased LV mass. All the clinical syndromes associated with myocardial ischemia are increased in patients with LV hypertrophy and therefore earlier recognition of both cardiac involvement and myocardial ischemia is likely to improve survival in this particularly high-risk group of patients.\r"

This combination of factors is probably reflected in the epidemiologic findings of increased coronary morbidity and mortality in hypertension, particularly when it is associated with LV hypertrophy. The failure of several antihypertensive trials to reduce coronary morbidity and mortality emphasizes the importance of early detection of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) among hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy. A strategy to detect asymptomatic CAD based on combined probability of 2 noninvasive tests is discussed. Results obtained in hypertensive LV hypertrophy showed a 20% to 30% incidence of abnormal exercise test results, and these positive findings were predictive for the development of typical angina during a 3-year follow-up. Based on these results and reported data, it is extrapolated that patients with silent ischemia may contribute up to 40% of the coronary mortality observed in previous antihypertensive trials. These findings suggest the need for an early detection and separate follow-up of these patients with silent CAD, to better assess the influence of antihypertensive treatment on coronary morbidity and mortality.\r"

Hypertensive endothelial injury is the likely root cause of the intimal thickening. High potassium diets prevent wall thickening of small renal arteries and arterioles in hypertensive Dahl S rats and also greatly reduce both medial and intimal thickening of the aorta and mesenteric and carotid arteries in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats. In view of this, it is quite likely that the low potassium diet characteristically seen in blacks exaggerates the hypertensive intimal thickening. A high potassium diet could possibly preserve these arteries and avert much renal failure.\r"

This review underscores the hemodynamic maladaptations and consequences and the evidence that suggests that glomerular hypertension is a necessary accompaniment to renal damage. The evidence reviewed indicates that high pressure develops in fragile glomerular capillaries after loss of a critical amount of renal mass and causes progressive sclerosis and destruction of remaining nephrons. This maladaptive renal response ensures progressive destruction in a variety of renal diseases including diabetes mellitus. Reduced protein intake and converting enzyme inhibitor therapy may prevent or attenuate the progression of these diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Both traditional and newer treatments of essential hypertension are discussed in relation to kidney function and renal perfusion. In essential hypertension, renal vascular resistance is routinely increased and renal blood flow is often decreased. Reduced sodium intake as a form of therapy will cause a decrease in both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, most likely due to an angiotensin-induced renal vasoconstriction caused by the reactive increase in renin release. Treatment with diuretics produces the same effects, also angiotensin-mediated. The addition of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent to prevent renin release may be a good choice, but individual agents within this class must be examined for direct renal vasoconstriction. The effects of \"nonspecific\" vasodilators on renal perfusion and renal sodium handling vary with the patient but may produce antinatriuresis, sodium retention and decrease in glomerular filtration. Studies with calcium antagonists have shown promising results. Nifedipine studies show a substantial increase in renal plasma flow, a well-maintained glomerular filtration rate and a brisk diuresis and natriuresis. However, patients with the lowest baseline renal flow do not show these benefits. Diltiazem has shown a potentiated renal vascular response in normotensive patients of hypertensive parents. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril have produced increased renal blood flow and well-maintained glomerular filtration in patients with essential hypertension. The agents available for treating hypertension have improved dramatically in the past decade. A salutary effect on the kidney will remain high on the list of important characteristics to be considered in choosing one of these agents.\r"

It is important to identify the patients destined to develop nephropathy, to define the pathophysiology responsible for the nephropathy in this subset of patients and to develop programs to interrupt the pathophysiology early in its course and hopefully prevent the progression to end-stage renal failure. Potential markers to identify patients who will develop nephropathy include a family history of hypertension, increased glomerular filtration rate and renal mass and presence of significant microalbuminuria. Studies are needed to evaluate various classes of drugs for their efficacy in altering the pathophysiologic hemodynamic changes leading to nephropathy.\r"

This disproportion raises the question of whether the renal circulation of blacks is more sensitive to the damaging effects of elevated intraarterial pressure or whether it is structurally different in ways that would render it more prone to damage. The first part of the question has not been conclusively answered although some data support the hypothesis. For the second part, it is clear that malignant nephrosclerosis of blacks is different from that of whites in an absence of fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles and glomeruli and the presence of musculomucoid intimal hyperplasia of small arteries. Whether this is a genetically determined reaction to damage has not been determined. It is a widely held belief that the kidney is the cause of much essential hypertension. In fact 6 cases of essential hypertension in blacks have been \"cured\" by renal transplantation, strongly supporting the belief. Also blacks differ from whites in 2 ways that could be relevant for their increased prevalence of hypertension: they excrete sodium loads more slowly and have a markedly lower urinary kallikrein. The former could be responsible for the predominance of salt-dependent hypertension in blacks and the latter could reflect a racial deficiency in a naturally occurring vasodilator system.\r"

The high sensitivity (roughly 10-fold greater) and specificity of echocardiography for detection of LV hypertrophy and assessment of the severity and the various forms of such hypertrophy have prompted critical evaluation of the risk associated with such LV hypertrophy. Initial information suggesting considerable risk associated with echocardiographically detected increases in LV mass suggests significant clinical and public health importance of this tool. Further detailed cost-benefit analyses are needed to aid in assessing the role of echocardiography in the evaluation of patients with borderline and mild hypertension.\r"

This contribution to risk exceeds that of the often accompanying hypertension. Once overt coronary disease occurs, electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy also further escalates risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The risk associated with electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy is particularly great when repolarization abnormality is present. Electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy and silent electrocardiographic myocardial infarction are similar in evolution and prognosis. LV hypertrophy is an important predictor of risk of cardiac failure; the electrocardiographic manifestation of LV hypertrophy predisposes to cardiac failure more than x-ray cardiac enlargement. Electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy heralds the onset of serious cardiovascular disease and premature mortality despite lack of associated symptoms. The serious prognosis of this abnormality warrants vigorous preventive management. More prospective data are needed comparing the prognosis of echocardiographic anatomical hypertrophy with that diagnosed by electrocardiography.\r"

  ".W": "Recent data demonstrate that in addition to its conduit function, the blood vessel is an active synthetic and secretory organ containing several autocrine and paracrine systems that are involved with the local regulation of its own function. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in modulating the balance between thrombogenesis and thrombolysis. In addition, it secretes vasorelaxant and vasoconstrictive substances, growth factors and inflammatory mediators that exert paracrine influences on vascular myocyte function. The vascular myocyte also expresses autocrine substances which influence its own function. The autocrine systems include angiotensin, prostaglandins, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor and heparin. These local factors exert modulatory influences on myocyte contractility and growth. It is conceivable that genetic or acquired abnormalities of one or several of these check and balance systems can result in increased vascular tone, generalized vascular hypertrophy or hyperplasia, or a combination, and contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. These autocrine-paracrine systems may be important targets for antihypertensive drug development.\r"

The serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] varied with sunshine score and were paralleled by serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]. The control subjects showed a higher sunshine score and higher serum 24(OH)D levels than the patients with hip fracture. Dietary vitamin D intake was similar in both groups (mean 115 IU/d). A positive correlation between vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D was observed in the patients with low sunshine exposure. It appeared from this relation that dietary vitamin D intake should be approximately 300 IU/d to maintain an adequate serum (25(OH)D concentration. Vitamin D status was very poor in patients who were institutionalized before hip fracture. Multiple regression analysis on serum 25(OH)D confirmed the primary role of sunshine exposure as determinant of vitamin D status. The principal determinants of serum 1,25(OH)2D were serum 25(OH)D, serum creatinine, and serum phosphate.\r"

Absorption of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol peaked earlier and was greater than absorption of cholecalciferol at all times in all three groups. Patients with mild cholestasis (normal bilirubin and fecal fat excretion) absorbed both forms of the vitamin normally. Those with severe cholestasis (jaundice and steatorrhea) had minimal absorption of cholecalciferol but relatively preserved absorption of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. Absorption of cholecalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol was inversely related to fecal fat excretion. The superior absorption of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol may partly explain its greater efficacy in oral treatment of vitamin D deficiency in patients with severe cholestasis.\r"

Plasma folate levels fell 60% during the depletion period and continued to fall until 200 micrograms/d of naturally occurring food folates were provided. Supplements of 300 micrograms/d of naturally occurring folates produced a small rise in plasma folate levels although erythrocyte folate levels continued to fall. Lymphocyte deoxyuridine suppression, neutrophil hypersegmentation, and other measurements related to folate metabolism were performed. When compared with PGA, dietary folates appeared to be no more than 50% available. A daily intake of 200-250 micrograms of dietary folates appears to meet the folate requirements of nonpregnant adult women whereas an intake of 300 micrograms/d provides an allowance for storage.\r"

Body compositional variables reflecting active protoplasmic tissue were all highly interrelated. Body weight alone gave prediction values for RMR that were comparable to those of other variables of active protoplasmic tissue mass. Regional distribution of fat had no influence on the RMR and the influence of age on RMR was trivial. The classic prediction equations and tables overestimate RMR of men. The 95%-confidence limits for both lean and obese men were broad. This conclusively demonstrates that metabolic efficiency is not necessarily or exclusively related to obesity. New regression equations for predicting the RMR based on weight and fat-free mass were developed: RMR = 879 + 10.2 WT kg and RMR = 290 + 22.3 FFMD kg, where FFMD is fat-free mass from densitometry measurements.\r"

These diets consisted of foods that were similar in appearance and palatability but differed in the amount of high-fat ingredients used. Relative to their energy consumption on the medium-fat diet, the subjects spontaneously consumed an 11.3% deficit on the low-fat diet and a 15.4% surfeit on the high-fat diet (p less than 0.0001), resulting in significant changes in body weight (p less than 0.001). A small amount of caloric compensation did occur (p less than 0.02), which was greatest in the leanest subjects (p less than 0.03). These results suggest that habitual, unrestricted consumption of low-fat diets may be an effective approach to weight control.\r"

During weeks 4-6, subjects underwent exercise training (30 min cycling/d, 5 d/wk, at 70% VO2max). The first 3 wk of caloric restriction decreased REE by 13% (from 1437 +/- 76 to 1254 +/- 66 kcal/24 h, means +/- SEM, p less than 0.05). Exercise training increased VO2max (from 1717 +/- 108 to 1960 +/- 120 mL/min, means +/- SEM, p less than 0.05) but did not elevate the dietary-depressed REE (from 1254 +/- 66 to 1262 +/- 62 kcal/24 h). The greatest decrease in body fat (3.7 +/- 0.4 kg) occurred during exercise training, resulting in a small apparent increase in REE when expressed per kilogram total body weight. However, expressed per unit lean body mass, REE remained suppressed throughout the period of caloric restriction. We conclude that exercise training of sufficient intensity to substantially increase VO2max does not reverse the dietary-induced depression of REE.\r"

During each study period, we measured plasma and urinary estrogens, plasma free and protein bound-estradiol-17 beta, the binding capacity of sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), androgens, progesterone, and prolactin levels. The omnivores consumed significantly more protein, total and saturated fatty acids, oleic and linoleic acids, and cholesterol than did the vegetarians. Hormonal status and binding capacity of SHBG were similar in both groups. However, for nonvegetarians, prolactin levels were positively correlated with dietary energy, protein, total and saturated fatty acids, and oleic acid. Further study delineating the effects of specific dietary nutrients on the basal level of prolactin secretion is warranted.\r"

Milk yield and litter weight at day 14 of lactation were compromised in the groups restricted during lactation. Dietary restriction during lactation had consistent negative effects on milk nutrient and energy contents. Plasma and milk corticosterone values were twice as high in the groups restricted during lactation as in the controls. Corticosterone but not prolactin values were correlated with many measures of lactational performance. These results suggest that the increase in corticosterone values may be one mechanism by which malnutrition exerts its effects on lactational performance.\r"

Total essential AA in patients increased as much as in control subjects; however, threonine and phenylalanine showed greater increases while leucine had a smaller increase. As a consequence of the observed alterations, a striking unbalance in the postprandial pattern of arterial AA ensued in CRF patients.

Expansion was due to a downward shift in proliferating cells towards the muscularis mucosa of the oat bran and pectin groups (p less than 0.01) while pectin also expanded the proliferative zone toward the mucosal surface (p less than 0.05). Because expanded proliferative zones have been shown to precede and accompany neoplastic transformation, these data suggest a potentially negative effect of dietary fiber on the gastric mucosa.\r"

Blood was drawn pre- and postexercise and post-30 min and post-60 min of exercise and analyzed for plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and total B-6. Twenty-four-hour urines were analyzed for 4-pyridoxic acid and urinary B-6. PLP and total B-6 increased significantly with exercise and decreased significantly from post- to post-60 min for all diets. Four-pyridoxic acid increased significantly from the preexercise day to the day of exercise for all diets. Although there was a significant change in B-6 metabolism with exercise, neither training, increased CHO, nor age had an effect on this change.\r"

The cases with diagnostic errors were reevaluated to define the pitfalls encountered in the intraoperative diagnosis of breast lesions by both methods. Results with the cytologic technics are more variable than with frozen sections, but when read by experienced observers the smears are as accurate as frozen sections and have the additional advantages of rapidity, sparing of tissue for other studies, better correlation with fine-needle aspiration cytologic results, and more complete sampling of large or multiple specimens. The authors recommend that intraoperative cytologic examination be employed routinely in breast diagnosis, initially always in conjunction with frozen section examination but eventually in many cases as an alternative technic.\r"

The special stains used in their differential diagnosis are nonspecific and not always sensitive. Therefore, the expression of cytokeratins of different molecular weights (54, 57, and 66 kilodaltons [kD]) was studied in 26 intraepithelial neoplasms in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues with the use of an avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method with monoclonal cytokeratin antibodies. These included 9 cases of Paget's disease, 11 cases of Bowen's disease, and 6 cases of Pagetoid superficial spreading melanoma. Paget cells from vulva and breast were always positive for 54-kD cytokeratin, variable for 57-kD cytokeratin, and negative for 66-kD cytokeratin. The neoplastic cells in all 11 cases of Bowen's disease were stained for 57-kD and 66-kD cytokeratins but not for 54-kD cytokeratin. The neoplastic cells in all cases of melanoma did not express any of the cytokeratins studied. The results indicate that antibodies to cytokeratins of different molecular weights may be used as a diagnostic tool in the distinction of Paget's disease from Bowen's disease and melanoma.\r"

None of the patients had clinical evidence of systemic granulomatous disease, although one patient subsequently was found to have hepatic portal granulomas. This uncommon tissue response to neoplasm is distinct from carcinomas with osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells.

Patients' red blood cells were washed in saline and layered on top of the membranes. After 5 minutes the membranes were washed and the results were read. A positive reaction had a red dot of adherent cells on the membrane, whereas a negative membrane remained white. Good correlation was observed between the DOT DAT and the hemagglutination DAT after testing of 131 patient samples. The primary advantages of the DOT DAT were its stability, simplicity, and objective end point.\r"

IgM class antibodies are detected as late as six months after the acute infection. In this study the authors describe a modified HAVAB test that inactivates the IgM class antibodies. It thus measures the proportion of IgG antibodies out of the total anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies. In a study of 139 patients with impaired liver function, the available and modified tests showed good agreement except for the convalescent phase of hepatitis A. During serial testing for three months after the acute infection, the commercial tests continuously detected IgM class antibodies. The modified test detected predominantly IgG class antibodies from four weeks on. By six weeks, 85% of the patients had predominantly IgG class antibodies. The modified test thus provides information on the timing of recent hepatitis A infection.\r"

The detection ratio (\"positive\" specimens detected by the Yellow IRIS divided by \"positive\" specimens detected by the manual method) for the presence of various analytes, as well as the presence of abnormal numbers of analytes, was determined. The significance of each detection ratio was tested by calculating the McNemar's statistic, which is useful in the evaluation of nonparametric data collected by two different methods on identical specimens. Results were considered abnormal if the red blood count was greater than or equal to three per high-power field, the white blood cell count was greater than or equal to five per high-power field, or squamous epithelial cells were greater than or equal to five per high-power field. The results indicate that the Yellow IRIS enhances the detection of urinary sediment components.\r"

Of the 109 calls evaluated, one was judged to have been handled incorrectly, and 7 others were considered to have been answered in a conditional manner. The Blood Bank generated the largest number of calls (66), and requests for blood products were the single most common call (29). The review of all on-call problems with staff pathologists proved to be a valuable educational tool, both for the residents and staff. In addition, the study served as an impetus for development of a useful program for evaluating and, if necessary, correcting decisions made by pathology residents.\r"

Parents of children with cardiac conditions perceived their children as more vulnerable and rated themselves and their children as having less control over improving their children's health status than did parents of the well children. Increased school absentee rates for the cardiac group were associated with measures of illness severity, parental patterns of absenting their child from school for minor illnesses, and decreased belief in their child's ability to improve his or her health status. For the well comparison group, increased absence was related to external health locus of control beliefs, increased maternal sick days, and demographic factors. School absence was not significantly related to social adaptation, self-esteem, or school achievement for either the well or cardiac groups.\r"

The most troubling question to arise, however, is whether a pregnant woman has a legal duty to avoid negligent behavior that may injure her future child. The unique and compelling conflicts that surround the recognition of such a prematernal duty encompass the child's right to be born free of any negligently induced injury and the pregnant woman's rights to personal privacy and bodily autonomy.\r"

In a retrospective review, the charts of 48 patients admitted between 1980 and 1985 with a history of a vertical fall from a height were examined. In comparison, a previous review from the same institution disclosed that 66 patients were admitted because of a vertical fall from a height between 1965 and 1974, suggesting an increase of 37.5%. Most children fell from heights of 12 ft or less, although an increasing proportion of children in our series (33%) fell from heights of 36 ft or less. Sites included windows, walls, and roofs. The peak age of incidence has increased from 2 to 6 years; however, the mean age of children in whom significant injury occurred was 7.5 years, with only 27% of children under 3 years of age suffering a documented injury, as opposed to 67% of children over 3 years of age. Children are more apt to suffer a fracture than any other injury, most likely a fracture of the ulna and/or radius. Although hospital costs are high, mortality rates (2%) and the incidence of long-term sequelae (4%) are low. In conclusion, falls in the urban setting continue to be a significant public health problem, particularly in the 6- to 7-year age group.\r"

A small number of families accounted for a disproportionately large number of visits for injuries. Individual members of families tended to have similar rates of injury, and these rates were stable over time. Individual accident experience is influenced by the family to which one belongs.

  ".W": "Three hundred twenty-two human bites in children, occurring during a six-year period, were reviewed. The majority occurred during warm-weather months between 2 PM and 11 PM. The upper extremities (42%), face and neck (33%), and trunk (22%) were most commonly bitten. At the time of injury, children were most often engaged in fights (61%) or play (26%). Seventy-five percent of wounds were superficial abrasions, 13% were punctures, and 11% were lacerations. None of the 242 abrasions became infected as opposed to 38% of the punctures and 37% of the lacerations. Other factors associated with increased risk of infection were delay in initial physician assessment beyond 18 hours after injury, location of the bite on the upper extremities, and occurrence of injury during sports activities. Prophylactic use of penicillin was probably not effective in reducing infection rates in these children; however, prospective data are needed to properly address this issue.\r"

We describe two typical patients and a study in experimental animals comparing the effectiveness of several previously described methods for removal. The most effective method involved using tweezers to remove clumps of spines followed by a thin layer of glue covered with gauze, which was allowed to dry and then peeled off to remove individual spines. Attempts to use adhesive tape or a thin layer of a commercial facial mask to aid in removal of the spines produced more retention and inflammation three days after removal than no treatment.\r"

Retinopathy of prematurity was replaced by genetic ocular disorders as the leading cause of congenital blindness, although the former is reemerging. The rate of congenital rubella infection also declined. There has been a significant increase in the rate of births with optic nerve lesions during the past 15 years, while the rate of births with lesions of the lens fell, reflecting the decline in the rate of maternal rubella infection. There are fewer children with congenital ocular legal blindness who have no light perception today, and they also have fewer associated handicaps.\r"

More than 90% of the infants weighing over 2500 g had none of these signs. In asymptomatic infants with one or more birth complications, the rate of CP by 7 years of age was 2.3/1000; among asymptomatic infants whose births were uncomplicated, the rate of CP was 2.4/1000. The risk for CP rose with number of abnormal neonatal signs, and children with sustained neonatal abnormalities were at higher risk than those whose abnormalities were transient. Most children with CP did not derive from groups at increased risk. The full-term infant whose birth was complicated but who was free of certain abnormal signs in the newborn period was not at increased risk of CP.\r"

A linear dose response was observed between the six levels of fiber intake (r = 0.983, p less than 0.01) with a 1-g increase in wheat fiber, producing a mean 2.7-g increase in fecal weight. This increase was independent of the initial daily fecal weight of the volunteer (mean 117 +/- 64 g/day, range 5-297 g/day, n = 73). The maximum increase in fecal output due to cereal fiber was reached after the first week on the supplement.

Early diagnosis may improve the chances of responding to specific antiviral therapy. We analyzed retrospectively the diagnostic evaluations of 26 AIDS patients with histopathologically confirmed CID infections and 19 AIDS or AIDS-related complex patients without CMV infections. The groups were similar demographically and clinically. Characteristic CMV inclusion bodies were found on antemortem biopsy in 92% of patients, including 80% for rectal biopsy alone. The specificity of the viral inclusions for CMV was established using an immunohistological technique. Rectal culture for virus isolation was much less sensitive (30%) than biopsy. Urine cultures were positive more frequently (39%) than were rectal cultures, but were less specific. Furthermore, the presence of immunoglobulin G anti-CMV was nonspecific and the presence of immunoglobulin anti-CMV was both insensitive and nonspecific. We conclude that mucosal biopsy is a rapid and reliable means of detecting cytomegalovirus infections, and is an indispensible part of the evaluation for this disease.\r"

All of the women had regular menstrual cycles, were normolipidemic, and on a hospital diet. On the same morning, blood and the darkest duodenal bile were taken after cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulation. Standard laboratory procedures were used to analyze serum and bile lipids. We found: 1) statistically significant (t test, p less than 0.05) but only slight hypercholesterolemia (+ 12%) in patients with gallstones; 2) a negative correlation of serum cholesterol with cholesterol saturation index of bile, both in the control group (r = -0.654, p less than 0.05) and in gallstone patients (r = -0.665, p less than 0.05); 3) a correlation of high density lipoprotein cholesterol with cholesterol saturation index only in normal women (r = -0.619, p less than 0.05); 4) conversely, a correlation of triglycerides with the same index in only gallstone patients (r = 0.641, p less than 0.05). With the stepwise multiple regression analysis (independent variables: diagnosis of gallstones, serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides; dependent variable: biliary cholesterol saturation index), only gallstone diagnosis and serum cholesterol influenced significantly (F test, p less than 0.05) the biliary cholesterol saturation index. These findings suggest that young women with radiolucent gallstones are slightly hypercholesterolemic, that in women both with and without gallstones there is a negative correlation between serum cholesterol and biliary cholesterol saturation, but women with gallstones have a higher cholesterol saturation index of the bile than women without gallstones with the same level of cholesterol in the blood.\r"

The level of 2,3-DPG in liver diseases occurred in the following increasing order: chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. A significant negative correlation between the 2,3-DPG concentration and serum albumin concentration was found in the liver diseases. The 2,3-DPG level was correlated to the serum concentration of total bile acids and to the arterial blood pH. A negative correlation was found between the arterial blood pH and the serum albumin concentration. The level of 2,3-DPG in hepatocellular carcinoma and/or liver cirrhosis was higher than that in more hypoxic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And an increased level of 2,3-DPG was also shown in nonhypoxic patients with liver diseases. These results suggest that the level of erythrocyte 2,3-DPG increases according to the severity of the liver disease, and compared to the level in hypoxic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the level of erythrocyte 2,3-DPG is higher in both hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis.\r"

Ultrasonography and computerized tomography scanning could not identify any pancreatic tissue in the region of the body or tail. Another endoscopic investigation revealed the main papilla in the third part of the duodenum. The ducts of Santorini and Wirsung were identified. Santorini's duct was dilated and contained calculi. Wirsung's duct was nearly normal. The junction between the two ducts was slightly narrowed. After papillotomy of the accessory papilla, the patient's abdominal pains disappeared.

  ".W": "It had been previously thought that protein excretion in hypertensive nephrosclerosis was less than 0.5 to 1.0 g/24 h. Furthermore, it was believed that proteinuria in the nephrotic range associated with hypertension was probably due to primary renal disease, malignant hypertension, renal artery stenosis, or pheochromocytoma. We report eight patients with biopsy-proven hypertensive nephropathy and heavy proteinuria in the absence of malignant hypertension or renal artery stenosis. The 24-hour protein excretion ranged from 2.7 to 4.3 g. All patients had renal insufficiency, with serum creatinine ranging from 2.0 (176.8) to 7.8 mg/dL (689.5 mumol/L). Renal function worsened in most patients during the follow-up period despite adequate control of the hypertension, and three patients had to be started on hemodialysis. Three patients died during the follow-up period. We conclude that hypertensive nephrosclerosis must be included in the differential diagnosis of marked proteinuria in patients with essential hypertension and that heavy proteinuria, along with renal insufficiency, are poor prognostic indicators in such patients.\r"

  ".W": "The preferred method of vascular access for routine hemodialysis is via an arteriovenous fistula into which two needles are inserted. Single-needle access is an alternative to this method. Thorough evaluations of the efficiency of the single-needle method are lacking. The present study evaluates the weekly time-averaged urea concentrations (TACUrea) and protein intake (PI) in 76 patients routinely treated with single-needle dialysis on a chronic basis. Furthermore, other clinical parameters of dialysis adequacy, such as hematocrit, nerve conduction velocity, hospitalization rate, and cumulative survival also were evaluated, as well as fistula survival. TACUrea appeared to be 53.2 +/- 6.0 mg/100 mL, a value corresponding to adequate two-needle dialysis with low morbidity, as outlined by the American National Cooperative Study Group. PI was evaluated from urea generation rates (G) and from outpatient dietary records. G was 6.07 +/- 2.42 mg/min, and the corresponding PI was calculated to be 1.07 +/- 0.28 g/kg body weight/24 h. PI estimated from dietary records was 1.14 +/- 0.43 g/kg body weight/24 h. The relation of total clearance over distribution volume (KT/V) averaged 0.98 +/- 0.23. Mean hematocrit and nerve conduction velocity during 2 years of follow-up ranged between 24% and 26% and 38 and 40 m/s, respectively. Hospitalization rate during 1 year was 18%. Five years' cumulative survival was 64% for the period 1975 to 1985, and 79% for the period 1980 to 1985. Five years' fistula survival was 74%, a value higher than in four studies on two-needle dialysis of comparable extent. It is concluded that urea kinetic data and other parameters of dialysis adequacy indicate that the efficiency of the single-needle technique is at least as good as that obtained in the more currently used two-needle technique. Subsequently, the current reluctance towards single-needle dialysis as a routine procedure in chronic renal failure, appears to be unjustified.\r"

Normal rats and rats with either glomerulopathy (nephrotoxic serum nephritis, adriamycin nephropathy), ablative nephropathy, or acute renal failure (ischemic, HgCl2) were subjected to simultaneous Ccr and inulin clearance (Cin) determinations at a time that plasma creatinine concentrations were maintained at 10 to 20 mg/dL by exogenous creatinine infusion. Cin ranged from 0.02 to 2.49 mL/min, and a nearly perfect correlation with Ccr (r = .997) was obtained. Excellent correlations between Ccr and Cin were found in each of the individual study groups. When the rats were subdivided into groups according to their level of renal function (Cin greater than 1.5 mL/min; Cin 0.5 to 1.49 mL/min; Cin 0.02 to 0.49 mL/min), excellent correlations between Cin and Ccr were still observed (r = .93, .97, and .97, respectively). We concluded that exogenous Ccr accurately reflects GFR in the rat over the entire range of renal function and in a wide variety of experimental nephropathies. Given the simple methodology, exogenous Ccr could have substantial research application for assessing degrees of excretory function in experimental renal disease.\r"

Studies were performed after 4 weeks of placebo and 6 weeks of amlodipine therapy, and included the assessment of systolic and diastolic BP, renal clearances of inulin and p-aminohippurate, and determination of body fluid composition. Systolic and diastolic BPs were reduced following 6 weeks of amlodipine monotherapy. In spite of significant decreases in mean arterial pressure, there were increases in inulin clearance (+ 13%), and p-aminohippurate clearance (+ 19%). Filtration fraction was not changed. Renal vascular resistance was decreased (-25%). Total blood volume, extracellular fluid volume, and total body water and body weight were not changed. We conclude that amlodipine therapy has the potential to reverse renal abnormalities encountered in the hypertensive state.\r"

Human glucocerebrosidase cDNA contains two potential ATG start codons in its long open reading frame. The signal peptides that are initiated from each ATG are quite different in their hydrophobicity. We demonstrate that either ATG can function independently to produce active glucocerebrosidase enzyme in cultured fibroblasts. The glucocerebrosidase activity produced from translation products initiated at either ATG is found predominantly in the lysosomes.\r"

Their derived amino acid sequences and that previously determined for the PIF protein completely explain the electrophoretic phenotypes of the acidic proline-rich proteins (PRPs) Pa, Db, and PIF. Thus, the Cys substitution near Arg 106 in the Pa protein sterically interferes with proteolytic cutting at Arg 106 and accounts for the single-banded phenotype. In contrast, the Db and PIF proteins are proteolytically cut at Arg 106 and show a double-banded phenotype. The Db protein has an extra 21-amino acid repeat that accounts for its larger size compared with the equal sized Pa monomer and PIF proteins. Several amino acid substitutions account for the charge and mobility differences of the Pa, Db, and PIF proteins in isoelectric-focusing gels. These DNA/protein correlations, as well as the extremely similar genomic-DNA sequences that differ by less than 1%, establish that Pa, Db, and PIF are alleles at the PRH1 locus. On the basis of the DNA sequences, we conclude that Db and Pa alleles diverged more recently from a common precursor than did the PIF allele from its precursor.\r"

Segregation analysis utilizing pedigree and cytogenetic data from 31 kindreds including five additional kindreds from additional sources has provided computation of genetic risks for counseling. An inv(8) carrier parent has a 6.2% risk of having a rec(8) child. The transmission rate of the inv(8) was significantly higher for inv(8) carrier mothers (59%) than for carrier fathers (42%). The combined transmission rate for both sexes was 53%. Risk for spontaneous abortion or stillbirth (11.3%) was not higher than the general population frequency of 13%-15%. It is significant that all kindreds identified to date are of Hispanic background with ancestors traced to the southern Colorado/northern New Mexico region. By means of extended pedigree information, three independently ascertained kindreds have been linked through common ancestry 4 generations in ascendance. The Hispanic background, geographic localization, and common ancestry in three kindreds suggest a single founder of the Hispanic inv(8) in the Southwest.\r"

The enzyme has the structure alpha 4 beta 4, with the alpha chain containing a covalently bound biotin prosthetic group. Patients have been placed into two major complementation groups, pccA and pccBC, that may correspond to the genes encoding the alpha and beta chains of PCC. The pccBC group is further divided into two subgroups, pccB and pccC, apparently owing to intragenic complementation. We previously reported combined alpha- and beta-chain deficiency in pccA mutants and absence of beta chain in pccC and pccBC mutants after isotope-tracer labeling and immunoprecipitation of cultured-fibroblast extracts. Using cDNA clones coding for the alpha and beta chains as probes, we found absence of alpha mRNA in four of six pccA strains and presence of beta mRNA in all pccA mutants studied. We also found presence of both alpha and beta mRNAs in three pccBC, two pccB, and three pccC mutants. From these data, we confirm the gene assignments of the complementation groups (PCCA gene = pccA complementation group; PCCB gene = pccBC and subgroups) and support the view that pccA patients synthesize a normal beta chain that is rapidly degraded in the absence of complexing with alpha chains.\r"

Individual recombinant phage containing human DNA inserts were identified by their hybridization to total human DNA sequences and by their failure to hybridize to total mouse DNA sequences. A repeat-free human DNA fragment was then subcloned from each of 14 such recombinant phage. An independent somatic-cell hybrid was used to assign all 14 subcloned fragments to chromosome 21. Thirteen of the fragments have been regionally mapped using a somatic-cell hybrid containing a human 21 translocation chromosome. Two probes map proximal to the 21q21.2 translocation breakpoint, and 11 probes map distal to this breakpoint, placing them in the region 21q21.2-21q22. One of seven probes used to screen for restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms recognized polymorphic DNA fragments when hybridized to genomic DNA from unrelated individuals.

We apply a stochastic (probabilistic) single-gene model to the occurrence of malformations in mouse and man. The stochastic single-gene model suggests the feasibility of isolating individual genes that determine morphogenesis and sets limits on the precision with which the recurrence of malformations can be predicted.\r"

Under appropriate hybridization conditions, these two probes can hybridize to their specific complementary alleles and thus allow the genotyping of the ALDH2 locus.\r"

Nabumetone is rapidly metabolized to an active metabolite, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (BRL 10720). The pharmacokinetics of the metabolite were studied in 24 healthy adult male volunteers. Each received a 1-g dose of the nabumetone formulations in a balanced, randomized, two-way crossover investigation. Serum metabolite concentrations were determined over a 120-hour interval by high-performance liquid chromatography. The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters computed for tablet and suspension are presented in that order: area under the curve = 1,269:1,338 mg.hour/ml; absorption half-life = 1.04:0.83 hour; elimination half-life = 27.16:25.15 hours; lag time = 0.19:0.07 hour; peak concentration = 27.56:31.91 micrograms/ml, and time to peak concentration = 4.99:4.17 hours. The mean concentration of BRL 10720 was found to be higher during the first eight hours for the suspension than for the tablet. Using criteria for statistical significance, the values for peak concentration, time to peak concentration, elimination half-life, and lag time were found significant (p less than 0.05). These results may well be reflecting the increased absorption characteristics of the suspension due to the pharmaceutical characteristics of the preparation. The formulations were found to be bioequivalent when compared on the premise that no significant difference was detected when area under the curve and all other parameters were compared, based upon the 75/75 rule analysis.\r"

This, unlike nabumetone, is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis and is considered to be the active anti-inflammatory metabolite. Nabumetone is active in all standard laboratory models of inflammation and has a greater ratio of active to gastric irritant doses (therapeutic ratio) in the rat than any other NSAID tested. The lack of effect on the gastric mucosa in all species has been a notable feature of the toxicology studies. In humans, relative bioavailability is similar after administration of different dose levels, the mean terminal plasma half-life of BRL 10720 being about 24 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing. The half-life of BRL 10720 does not change on repeated dosing, and no unexpected or irreversible accumulation occurs in elderly patients.\r"

  ".W": "Nabumetone, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug of the naphthylalkanone class, was studied in an open-label fashion to compare the relative single-dose and steady-state kinetics in young healthy male volunteers and in elderly patients with degenerative joint disease. Seventeen healthy male volunteers 21 to 30 years of age and 17 patients 60 to 75 years of age were studied. After a single oral dose of 1,000 mg nabumetone, blood and urine samples were collected over a five-day period. Plasma was assayed for nabumetone and the active metabolite, 6-methoxynaphthylacetic acid, and the urine was assayed for five metabolites. Following this phase, they received daily oral doses of 1,000 mg nabumetone for 14 days. After the final dose, blood and urine samples were again collected for five days for the same assays. These data were fitted to a single compartment model and the derived data are as follows: mean maximal plasma concentration, maximal time concentration, area under the plasma-time curve, elimination rate constant, and elimination half-life in the young group after single dose were 22.9, 8.4, 838, 0.032, and 21.2, respectively, whereas on steady-state, values were 33.6, 4.1, 666, 0.031, and 22.1, respectively. In the elderly group after single dose, these values were 30.2, 10.8, 1,538, 0.024, and 29.2, whereas on steady-state, they were 50.0, 7.2, 1,092, 0.027, and 25.6. The accumulation ratio was 1.6 in the young and 1.8 in the elderly. Side effects in the young were mild and consistent of headaches, epigastric discomfort, nausea, and vomiting, whereas in the elderly they consisted mainly of headaches. No significant changes in complete blood cell count, blood chemistries, or urinalysis were noted. We concluded from these data that the drug does not accumulate if given every 24 hours; therefore, a single daily dose should provide sufficient therapy and that due to a difference in elimination, elderly patients may require a lower dose.\r"

Semiquantitative scoring methods for cartilage loss and osseous erosions developed by Sharp (Arthritis Rheum 1971; 14: 706-720) and Larsen (Scand J Rheum 1973; 2: 136-138) have established standards for sensitivity and interobserver reliability. Sharp (Arthritis Rheum 1985; 28: 16-24) has shown that in order to reliably measure change in erosion score, a certain degree of worsening (i.e., progression) must take place. At least one year is necessary, preferably two. Others have shown that rheumatoid arthritis erosions take place and progress early (Years 1 to 3) in most patients, and once destruction is established it may not be possible to adequately assess further change radiographically. Therefore, in order to perform a clinical trial of \"disease modifying\" agents with radiographic analysis as endpoint, the selections of a proper study population and time interval are most critical. Although it may be difficult to perform, an ideal clinical study for a therapeutic intervention would use patients with rheumatoid arthritis of less than five years' disease duration and perform radiographic analysis at a 24-month minimum interval. The selection of a proper control group may be a near impossibility under these circumstances.\r"

  ".W": "The chondrocyte holds a key position in the development of osteoarthritis. As the only living element of the articular cartilage, it produces the components of the matrix, i.e., collagens and proteoglycans. In the course of its life, the chondrocyte is susceptible to nutrient and toxic dangers. This leads to a qualitative and quantitative jeopardy of the matrix production. Collagens and proteoglycans are also subject to metabolic influences. Whatever the cause(s), osteoarthritis results in deficient masking of the collagen fibers and in roughening of the cartilaginous surface. Thus, the phase of \"wear and tear\" is initiated, which is characteristic of osteoarthritis. This process may provoke a total loss of cartilage and opening of the subchondral medullary spaces. However, osteoarthritis probably only becomes clinically manifest when a secondary synovitis supervenes, which is caused by mediators developing from degradation products of the cartilaginous matrix. Thus, osteoarthritis can be considered to develop from a disproportion between the quality of the matrix and load to the cartilage. Aside from avoiding non-physiologic overload to the articular cartilage, therapy must influence the secondary synovitis. Furthermore, an attempt should be made to interfere effectively with the chondrocytic metabolism by means of \"chondroprotective substances.\"\r"

They then synthesized a new cartilage matrix and were morphologically differentiated; they had a round shape and were situated inside small individual cavities (lacunae). The amounts of proteoglycan released into culture medium and present in chondrocyte clusters were maximal on the third to fifth day of culture; production decreased and stabilized from the 10th day to the end of culture. During the first days of culture, monomeric proteoglycans were present in large proportion; they gradually decreased between the sixth and 11th day of culture. These results suggest a modified synthesis of proteoglycan and hyaluronic acid during cultivation.\r"

At the end of the treatment period, animals were killed, and the articular surfaces of the knees were studied using histologic and histochemical techniques. Microscopic studies showed that the number of cells and the depth of the cartilage were significantly (p less than 0.001) increased in SAMe-treated rabbits in comparison with placebo-treated animals. No difference was found in comparing data in animals given SAMe at the two dosage levels. In conclusion, these results suggest a chondroprotective effect of SAMe in animals with experimental osteoarthritis.\r"

  ".W": "The fibric acid derivatives continue to have a place in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. The third generation of these drugs, including fenofibrate, appears to offer some advantages over those currently available in the United States. These drugs should be prescribed only after dietary and lifestyle changes have been offered as the preferable treatment. In severe hypertriglyceridemia, clofibrate, gemfibrozil, or fenofibrate may reduce the very low-density lipoprotein and chylomicron levels adequately. Dysbetalipoproteinemia may also be completely controlled by a combination of diet and any one of these drugs. When the low-density lipoprotein level is elevated, the newer fibric acid derivatives, such as fenofibrate, may be more effective in lowering the plasma cholesterol levels. This is true for those patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein and normal very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride levels, as well as those with elevated very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride levels. A 20 percent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is expected when the triglyceride levels are not elevated. When the very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride levels are elevated, the low-density lipoprotein response is more variable, and on occasion the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level may rise as the very low-density lipoprotein level is reduced. The average reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (about 6 percent) caused by fenofibrate may be greater in patients with elevated very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride levels than by other fibrates. In combination with other agents that lower low-density lipoprotein levels more specifically, such as the bile acid sequestrants and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, fenofibrate may act to effect control of the triglycerides allowing management of those patients with disorders producing elevated very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein levels. Extensive European experience with fenofibrate (six million patient-years) indicates that severe side effects are unlikely. However, the physician should monitor patients for skin rash, liver and renal function abnormalities, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and generalized muscle tenderness. All of these usually appear very early in the course of treatment and are reversible. Of greater concern is the possibility of an increased incidence of cholelithiasis, since the bile becomes relatively enriched in cholesterol during therapy with any fibric acid derivative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

It explores the issue by: (1) reviewing the history of the problem and the \"state of the art\" today, (2) examining the moral problem of using brain-dead persons as incubators for potential or actual others, (3) searching for moral differences between maternal death early or late in pregnancy, and (4) presenting a possible resolution in such tragic cases. It concludes that (1) a moral necessity to deliver viable infants from brain-dead mothers exists; (2) the farther from viability brain death occurs, the more maintaining the mother as an incubator resembles experimental therapy with its imperative for careful, informed consent; (3) experimental therapy not being morally necessary, its proceeding under these tragic circumstances should invoke community support for the next of kin in dealing with the immediate and long-term costs; (4) all ethical problems proceed in a context to which the moral actors must be sensitive and one that alters the conclusions made.\r"

To better characterize factors that predispose women to unintended laparotomy, we analyzed data from the Collaborative Review of Sterilization. Of the 5027 women undergoing laparoscopic tubal sterilization, 12 had unintended laparotomies to manage complications, whereas 39 women had unintended laparotomies because of technical inability to complete the laparoscopic procedure. Women with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery had an increased risk of unintended laparotomy (relative risk = 10.2, 95% confidence interval = 5.3 to 19.7). Women with a history of intrauterine device use or pelvic inflammatory disease had elevated risks that were not statistically significant (relative risk = 2.2 and 1.5, respectively). Comparative studies of alternative surgical approaches for tubal sterilization are needed to formulate recommendations for women who may be at increased risk of unintended laparotomy associated with the laparoscopic approach.\r"

However, women whose first pregnancy or livebirth occurred before age 20 years showed elevated risks of subsequent myocardial infarction compared with nulliparous ones (relative risks = 2.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.1 to 4.9), and there was a significant trend of increasing risk with earlier first birth. These associations were evident in both younger and middle-age women and were not explained by allowance for several identified potential confounding factors.\r"

Free testosterone (16.6 ng/dl) and estriol (10.8 ng/ml) reached their peak at 36 weeks of gestation. During the second term pregnancy, peak values of human chorionic gonadotropin (150,900 mIU/ml) and total testosterone (870 ng/dl) occurred at 10 and 5 weeks of gestation, respectively, before two fetuses of a triplet pregnancy degenerated.\r"

  ".U": "88074517\r", 
  ".W": "Incompetence of the uterine cervix is a syndrome of painless, progressive dilatation and effacement occurring between the sixteenth and twenty-fourth weeks of gestation that represents abnormal functioning. It may serve as a model to elucidate normal function. Because the incompetent cervix results in painless opening of this organ without uterine contraction before term gestation, it is considered one of the causes of midtrimester spontaneous abortion, habitual spontaneous abortion, and early preterm labor. Untreated, it leads to rapid expulsion and often death of the fetus. We used light microscopy to compare decreased elastic fibers in incompetent cervices with those of normal nonpregnant and pregnant cervices. Morphologic analysis of this difference was extended to biochemical quantification of elastin content in one patient with cervical incompetence. The decrease in elastin suggests that one function of cervical elastin may be to maintain a closed and undilated cervix throughout gestation. There may be a relationship between changes in cross-linked elastin and the incompetent cervix; further studies are therefore indicated.\r"

The mean duration for the achievement of a contraction stress test was 20.9 +/- 11.5 minutes for the breast stimulation test group and 81.3 +/- 48.4 minutes in the oxytocin challenge test group. Uterine hyperstimulation occurred once in each group. No gravida went into labor within 24 hours.

During the 30-year period 1950 through 1979, the committee reviewed in detail 75.9% of the pregnancy-related deaths that occurred in Oklahoma. The maternal mortality ratio in 1950 was 95.1/100,000 live births, and for 1979 it was 8.1/100,000 live births, a decrease of 91.5%. The risk of death from childbearing remained greater for black women than for American Indian or white women throughout the three decades. For American Indian women, the risk of death associated with pregnancy has decreased and is almost equal to the risk for white women. The Maternal Mortality Committee estimated that two thirds of Oklahoma's maternal deaths were preventable. The proportion of deaths judged preventable did not vary substantially during the study period. We conclude that maternal mortality in Oklahoma can be reduced to fewer than three deaths per 100,000 live births. Intensive monitoring and investigation of deaths and their causes by local maternal mortality committees continues to be an important mechanism for obtaining information to assist health workers in the prevention of deaths.\r"

A three-part self-administered, self-rating grief index questionnaire was used. There was no statistical difference on overall grief scores between the two matched groups. The treatment group reported significantly lower scores than the control group on the two grief subscales of anger-hostility and physical symptoms. Women who reported more life changes before the perinatal death tended to have fewer problems with the symptomatology of grief. Social support was an important variable in explaining grief symptomatology.

A 2-month therapy with 1.25 mg of gestrinone daily induced a degree of cellular inactivation and degeneration of the endometriotic implants that was more pronounced than after 4 months of therapy with either gestrinone (2.5 mg twice or thrice weekly) or danazol (600 mg daily). There was no correlation between the morphologic response to treatment and either the hormonal response of the foci during the menstrual cycle before therapy or the change in laparoscopic staging of endometriosis at the end of therapy. It is suggested that a short-term medical treatment should be further evaluated clinically in the treatment of endometriosis and infertility.\r"

  ".W": "In 14 pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth retardation, the umbilical cord was sampled before delivery under ultrasonic guidance for rapid fetal karyotyping. Fetal blood was analyzed for respiratory gases, acid-base balance, and lactate concentrations. Two patients were excluded from the study because cord samples were diluted with amniotic fluid. In six patients (group 1), the clinical assessment warranted continuation of pregnancy. Cesarean sections were performed in the remaining eight patients (group 2) within 8 hours of cord sampling. The data from the two groups were compared with those obtained from umbilical venous blood at the time of elective repeat cesarean section in term appropriate for gestational age infants (controls). No significant difference in PO2 was found between groups 1 and 2 and controls. In contrast, there were significant differences in oxygen saturation and acid-base balance between groups 1 and 2. Lactate concentration was inversely correlated with pH and was elevated in five of six fetuses requiring a prompt cesarean section: In two of these five fetuses, nonstress fetal heart rate tracings were reactive. The results suggest that fetal blood biochemistry, and particularly lactate concentration, may represent an additional indicator of fetal well-being in pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth retardation.\r"

If there is some type of intrauterine constraint, the tensile forces on the cord will be diminished, and cord length at term will be shorter than if no such constraint is present. One would expect that the voluntary movements of twins would develop under a constraint and that they would have less free space to move compared with single fetuses. If this hypothesis is valid, cord lengths of twins at term would be shorter than those of single pregnancy infants. We measured the cord lengths of 118 infants in 59 twin births and compared them with cord lengths in 9601 single pregnancies. We found that on the average, the umbilical cord length of the twins was 7.90 cm shorter than that of single pregnancy infants.\r"

Analysis of variance was adjusted for length of gestation and sex. A significant caffeine-cigarette interaction was found on birth weight (F = 85.4, p less than 0.01). Among women smoking 15 cigarettes or more per day, birth weight was 206 gm (+/- 57.7 gm) lighter for babies whose mothers consumed 300 mg or more of caffeine per day. Head circumference and length of the newborns were affected only by cigarette smoking. Another caffeine-cigarette interaction was observed on placental weight (F = 15.0, p less than 0.01). Among women who consumed less than 300 mg of caffeine daily, placental weight increased with cigarette consumption. However, it diminished (p less than 0.05) among women smoking 15 cigarettes or more per day if they consumed 300 mg or more of caffeine daily. This is the first time that such interactions were found to influence birth and placental weights, indicating that the concomitant consumption of caffeine and cigarette constitutes a higher risk for the developing fetus.\r"

This study was carried out to determine whether zinc status would be affected in pregnant women exposed to cadmium through cigarette smoke. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the levels of cadmium and zinc; 65 pregnant women who smoke and 84 who do not smoke were studied. Our data reveal that increased cadmium levels in pregnant women as the result of smoking increase placental zinc levels and decrease cord red blood cell zinc levels. Significantly higher levels of both cadmium and zinc were found in the placentas of pregnant women who smoke; moreover, stepwise multiple regression showed that maternal whole blood cadmium levels predicted placental zinc levels. In regard to cord blood, a significant 9% decrease in the red blood cell zinc level was observed in infants of mothers who smoke and this decrease was correlated with smoking activity, as evaluated by measuring plasma levels of thiocyanate. Also cord red blood cell zinc levels were found to correlate with placental zinc levels in nonsmokers but not in smokers. Overall, our data show that a cadmium/zinc interaction does take place in the maternal-fetal-placental unit of pregnant women who smoke and results in less favorable zinc status in the infants.\r"

  ".W": "It is universally accepted that smoking during pregnancy results in decreased infant birth weight. However, the mechanism for decreased birth weight is not completely understood. This study tested the hypothesis that the cadmium/zinc interaction in the maternal-fetal-placental unit of the mother who smokes could be related to birth weight. Thiocyanate was used as the index of smoking status and atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to determine trace elements. Results show that cord vein red blood cell zinc and maternal whole blood cadmium levels are significant predictors of infant birth weight when variance that is due to clinical factors and thiocyanate is controlled with stepwise multiple regression techniques (n = 202). Bivariate correlation techniques showed that the factors affecting birth weight were different in the smoking and nonsmoking groups. For example, in nonsmokers (n = 125), the cord vein red blood cell zinc level was positively related to birth weight. In smokers (n = 77), maternal whole blood cadmium, placental cadmium, and placental zinc levels were negatively related to birth weight; the ratio of placental zinc to placental cadmium and the cord vein red blood cell zinc level were positively related to birth weight. The results suggest that increased maternal cadmium and decreased cord vein red blood cell zinc levels in infants of smokers may be significant clinically since increased maternal whole blood cadmium and decreased cord vein red blood cell zinc levels are both significantly related to decreased birth weight.\r"

In the nulliparas, both the mean arterial pressure and the maximal mean arterial pressure during the second trimester were greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg in 22% and 34% of the patients, respectively. For the multiparas, the percentages with greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg were 30% and 35%, respectively. Only 8.7% of nulliparas with eclampsia had a maximal diastolic pressure during the second trimester greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg and no patient had a diastolic pressure of greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg. A review of the literature suggests that the mean arterial pressure observed during the second trimester has poor predictive value for future development of preeclampsia-eclampsia. We conclude that there is no correlation between second-trimester blood pressure recordings and subsequent eclampsia.\r"

Acute reduction of oxygen tension in the maternal perfusate induced prompt fetoplacental vasoconstriction that recovered rapidly on restoration of oxygen to the perfusate. The response, hypoxic fetoplacental vasoconstriction, could be repeatedly demonstrated in the same cotyledon. The time course of hypoxic fetoplacental vasoconstriction was inversely related to oxygen tension of maternal arterial and maternal and fetal venous perfusates. Maternal and fetal venous perfusate pH and PCO2 did not change during the response. It is concluded that hypoxic fetoplacental vasoconstriction is triggered by decreased oxygen availability. It is suggested that hypoxic fetoplacental vasoconstriction may play a role in local regulation of human fetoplacental blood flow in vivo and may contribute to poor fetal prognosis in preeclampsia.\r"

  ".W": "Lidocaine was recently found to rapidly cross the placenta and result in considerable fetal exposure after local infiltration of the perineum for episiotomy. For this reason, a more appropriate agent for local perineal infiltration might be a drug with rapid metabolism and inactive metabolites. 2-Chloroprocaine, an ester-linked local anesthetic agent, is available but is not commonly used for this procedure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the placental transfer of 2-chloroprocaine after local perineal infiltration. The drug was administered to 17 normal term pregnant women for episiotomy. After local perineal infiltration, the levels of 2-chloroprocaine and/or its metabolite, chloroaminobenzoic acid, were quantitated in maternal and neonatal plasma or urine. The pharmacologic data indicated that 2-chloroprocaine was nondetectable at delivery in maternal and umbilical cord vein; one patient had trace levels in the cord. Chloroprocaine was not detectable in neonatal plasma, but chloroaminobenzoic acid was detectable in both maternal and cord vein plasma. Mean levels of chloroaminobenzoic acid in maternal plasma at delivery were 1.04 +/- 0.32 micrograms/ml, and mean levels in cord vein were 0.35 +/- 0.54 micrograms/ml. Clinically, 2-chloroprocaine provided good analgesia. These results indicate that very little, if any pharmacologically active drug, reaches the fetus after local perineal infiltration with 2-chloroprocaine. Therefore 2-chloroprocaine appears to be preferable to lidocaine when used for local perineal infiltration.\r"

The preterm birth initiated by RU 486 was preceded and accompanied by the extensive development of gap junctions between myometrial cells. R 5020, but neither progesterone nor dexamethasone, prevented preterm birth and the development of gap junctions. Estrogen and progesterone levels declined after RU 486 treatment but only after a major proportion of the fetuses were delivered. This study indicates that progesterone may normally inhibit uterine contractility by suppressing the genome responsible for the expression of gap junctions.\r"

Drug concentrations in the maternal and fetal plasma and the amniotic and tracheal fluids were measured by means of capillary gas-liquid chromatographic assay techniques. Both metoclopramide and diphenhydramine were excreted into tracheal fluid in substantial quantities. Tracheal metoclopramide concentrations were found to exceed fetal plasma levels by about fifteen-fold while diphenhydramine attained maximal excretion in tracheal fluid of about five times that seen in fetal plasma. Drug levels were observed to accumulate slowly in amniotic fluid and eventually to exceed tracheal concentrations. The markedly elevated concentrations of these drugs in fetal lung fluid suggests that the fetal lung may be an important route of drug distribution, elimination, and excretion.\r"

Patients who developed this complication tended to be young males with severe retinal neovascularization and extensive retinal ischemia; traction retinal detachment as an indication for surgery; placement of a scleral buckle; postoperative rubeosis iridis, recurrent vitreous hemorrhages, and retinal detachment; and multiple surgeries. Four eyes progressed to atrophia bulbi.

  ".W": "The primary data in this report showed that prolonged multiplication of the M strain of Plasmodium cynomolgi in splenectomized rhesus monkeys led frequently to emergence of parasites whose virulence for monkeys with intact spleens was markedly attenuated while that for splenectomized monkeys was unimpaired. Expressions of attenuation regularly included reductions in the height of the peak parasitemia and in some instances failure to induce infection with inocula 1,000-fold those infective for splenectomized monkeys. Attenuation of virulence, once established, was maintained through as many as 17 serial passages in intact monkeys and more than 100 such transfers in splenectomized monkeys. Not only asexual blood stages, but also sexual stages (gametocytes) carried the attenuated characteristic, as indicated by its ready passage through mosquitoes. Studies in monkeys with sporozoite-induced infections showed that the persisting exoerythrocytic stages did not participate in the attenuation phenomenon; for when erythrocytic parasites of reduced virulence were cleared from the blood by either immune processes or chemotherapy, they were replaced upon relapse with parasites of unimpaired virulence. A major effort to determine whether splenectomized monkeys carried plasma or erythrocyte factors responsible for displays of attenuated virulence was nonproductive. An intact spleen was the essential element in these displays, for they disappeared immediately upon removal of this organ. The attenuation phenomenon probably reflects selection of spontaneously occurring mutants with limited capacity to escape normal splenic clearance mechanisms and unimpaired or even enhanced capacity to multiply in splenectomized monkeys.\r"

It was found that female worms containing less than 20 uterine eggs contributed little to the accumulation of eggs in the tissues of infected mice. Such worms also generally appeared to be immature. The variable rate of maturation of worms is likely to have profound effects on the immune reactions of mice as well as on the pathologic response to infection. Systematic delay in oviposition was serendipitously found in worms from mice which had been irradiated for other purposes prior to exposure to S. japonicum, and from the fourth to the sixth week after infection egg production by worms in irradiated mice lagged well behind that in intact mice. Seven to 10 weeks after infection these worms were laying normal numbers of eggs, as judged by egg passage per worm pair in the feces and the accumulation of eggs in the tissues. S. mansoni developed normally in irradiated mice.\r"

All developed high serum levels of antibodies to dirofilarial antigens and became persistently microfilaremic. The dogs were killed at various times between 398 and 562 days post-infection and renal lesions were examined by light, electron, and immunofluorescent microscopy and antibody elution techniques. A membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis was observed in all dogs. Immunofluorescence was positive in all; predominantly in a fine granular pattern along the glomerular capillary wall. Ultrastructural examination showed intramembranous globular electron-dense deposits and a linear band of fine electron-dense particles in all dogs. Antibody elution studies demonstrated antibody reactive to dirofilarial antigens. In a subsequent experiment, an aqueous-soluble antigen prepared from adult female D. immitis was infused into the renal arteries of 5 heartworm-naive dogs. Immunofluorescent examination of the infused kidneys showed dirofilarial antigen present on the glomerular capillary wall in a fine granular pattern indicating there was adherence of the antigen to the capillary wall. These observations support the hypothesis of in situ immune complex formation as part of the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis associated with dirofilariasis.\r"

  ".W": "Protective immune responses against the infective larvae of Brugia malayi have been demonstrated in BALB/c mice. Various factors governing resistance to reinfection have been examined to provide baseline data for use of this model in studies of immunoprophylaxis. Parasites that established following a primary infection survived for approximately 10 days, following which numbers declined rapidly to a low level. Resistance was evidenced by a more rapid clearance of secondary infection parasites. The degree of immunity expressed was not related to the route of administration of the initial infection (subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal). However, both the level of resistance and the rapidity of its expression were dependent on dose, with as few as 2 larvae stimulating measurable immunity. Sensitization with living male or female adult worms, fourth stage larvae or microfilariae of B. malayi, or infective larvae of B. pahangi conferred substantial resistance to larval challenge. Significant levels of immunity were also induced by dead B. malayi larvae (46%) and their aqueous extracts (76%), but not with the corresponding insoluble fraction. We suggest that this experimental system is ideally suited to aid in the identification of putative protective antigens in brugian filariasis.\r"

  ".W": "Alveolar hydatid disease is a serious and often fatal condition caused by infection with the metacestode form of Echinococcus multilocularis. Sera of 21 patients with histologically confirmed disease were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a semi-purified E. multilocularis antigen fraction (Em2) and by indirect hemagglutination (IHA) and double diffusion (DD5) tests using antigens prepared from E. granulosus cyst fluid. At diagnosis, sera from all 21 patients were positive by Em2 ELISA, 18 (86%) by IHA, and 5 (24%) by DD5. Em2 ELISA detected an antibody response earlier than IHA in 4 of 9 patients from whom sera were available before diagnosis. Following complete surgical resection, Em2 ELISA converted from positive to negative in serum of 2 of 3 patients, while IHA results did not change. Following incomplete resection, 14 of 15 patients tested remained positive by Em2 ELISA, while 12 remained positive by IHA. Of sera from 361 healthy persons from regions free of E. multilocularis, none were positive by Em2 ELISA, while 8% were positive by IHA. Of sera from 59 patients with non-echinococcal parasitic infections, none were positive by Em2 ELISA, while 31% were positive by IHA. Thus, in comparison with tests using E. granulosus antigens, Em2 ELISA appears to be more sensitive and specific for diagnosing AHD, useful on follow-up of resected patients, and positive earlier in the course of disease.\r"

During the first 24 hr of therapy, there was a reduction in the number of stools in 18/21 (86%) of patients treated with the 5-day regimen (trimethoprim-5) and 13/15 (87%) of patients treated with a single dose (trimethoprim-1), compared with 7/17 (41%) of the placebo group (P less than 0.025, both comparisons). The mean number of stools passed in the first 24 hr of therapy was 10.6, 10.8, and 21.3 stools in the trimethoprim-5, trimethoprim-1, and placebo groups, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) change in number of stools from baseline among treated patients during the first 24 hr was -4.9 (6.6) and -6.3 (6.3) for the trimethoprim-5 and trimethoprim-1 groups, respectively, compared with an increase of +2.4 (14.8) for the placebo group. There was a clinical failure at 48 hr in 9% of the trimethoprim-5 patients and 13% of trimethoprim-1 patients compared with 70% of placebo patients (P less than 0.005, both comparisons). Although we were unable to demonstrate a difference in efficacy between the two dosage schedules of trimethoprim, we conclude that both treatment regimens are effective for the treatment of Shigella dysentery.\r"

Culture of blood samples in BSK II medium demonstrated that cotton rats developed spirochetemias that lasted for a minimum of 3 to 4 weeks and were of sufficient concentration to infect simultaneously feeding normal I. scapularis nymphs. The spirochetemias were characterized by alternating spirochete-positive and spirochete-negative phases similar to patterns caused by relapsing fever borreliae. The possibility that B. burgdorferi is subject to antigenic variations, as reported for the relapsing fever spirochete, B. hermsii, is suggested.\r"

Strains of virus employed for dengue types 1, 2, 3, and 4 were from Fiji, Bangkok, Burma, and Medan, respectively. After parental females were infected by intrathoracic inoculation, F1 larval and pupal progeny were tested for the presence of virus by inoculating aliquots of triturated suspensions into Toxorhynchites amboinensis mosquitoes. Dengue type 1 was transmitted vertically by 11 strains of mosquitoes representing 8 species with the highest filial infection rates observed for Ae. cooki (1.2%). Vertical transmission of the other dengue virus serotypes was observed for fewer species of mosquitoes, however the filial infection rates of those demonstrating vertical transmission were between 1%-2% for types 2 and 3, and about 0.5% for type 4. Tests with the progeny of individual Ae. cooki and Ae. polynesiensis infected with dengue virus types 1 and 3, respectively, showed that approximately greater than or equal to 50% of the parental females transmitted virus to their progeny. Highest filial infection rates were 6.7% for Ae. cooki and 4.6% for Ae. polynesiensis.\r"

This uniformity suggests that the distribution of Thogoto virus is due to repeated introduction of virus from common sources and that such introduction may depend on the movement of tick-infested domestic animals.\r"

Recovery time from administration of the sedative until compliance with simple commands was significantly longer in the nalbuphine/morphine group (89 vs 196 seconds) but this was not felt to be of clinical importance. This combination was better in terms of sedation at the time of insertion of the nerve blocks, lack of recall of insertion of the nerve block, incidence of intra-operative complications, surgeon's assessment of operating conditions and patient acceptability. This fixed dose by weight drug combination for intravenous sedation should be applied widely.\r"

There were no significant differences between sides in terms of [H+] or PCO2. It is considered that the differences in capillary PO2 were due to local tissue vasodilatation. The presence of chlorbutol in the sodium heparin flushing solution is implicated as the causative factor. Further study of 20 patients using preservative-free heparin demonstrated no significant differences between cannulated and non-cannulated sides in terms of capillary PO2, PCO2 or [H+]. Sodium heparin with chlorbutol appears to improve local tissue oxygenation and is recommended for use in flushing solutions for invasive arterial monitoring.\r"

Accumulation of guanethidine at the sympathetic nerve ending, resulting in autonomic denervation, might be the underlying mechanism of the prolonged hypotension.

In two patients with dural puncture in whom air had been used to locate the epidural space, cerebrospinal fluid did not drip from the hub of the needle. A test dose did not reveal incorrect catheter placement in seven patients. The provision of an epidural infusion of Hartmann's solution for 24 hours, together with bed rest, appeared to delay the onset of dural puncture headache rather than prevent it entirely. Blood patching was required only in five of the 21 patients but was entirely successful. The implications of these observations in relationship to obstetric epidural practice are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A guinea pig model of halothane hepatitis was used to explore the humoral immune response induced by multiple halothane exposures and the potential role this response might play in contributing to liver damage. Three different strains of guinea pigs (Strain 2, Amana, and Hartley) were exposed to 1% halothane under either 21 or 80% oxygen for 4 hr at 2-week intervals. In each strain, halothane induced the appearance of an antibody cross-reactive with trifluoroacetylated guinea pig serum albumin (TFA-GSA). Three of six Strain 2 guinea pigs demonstrated an association between antibody titer and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase levels. However, the possible cause and effect relationship between these two factors requires more investigation. Hartley guinea pigs had a 4- to 11-fold higher level of anti-TFA antibody than the other two strains because of either a \"higher responder\" genetic background or exposure conditions that favored oxidative metabolism of halothane. Immunization of Amana guinea pigs with TFA-GSA evoked a specific anti-TFA antibody response. However, the presence of this antibody before halothane exposure did not potentiate the transient liver damage induced by exposure. Thus, these results demonstrate that in guinea pigs multiple exposures to halothane induce the formation of an antibody that recognizes a reactive intermediate of halothane formed during the anesthetic's metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether there is a relation between patient age and the effective dose of epidural morphine for relief of incisional pain after abdominal hysterectomy, experience treating 66 patients between the ages of 22 and 84 years was retrospectively examined. Linear regressions were plotted for age vs effective 24-hr morphine dose, age vs pain at rest, and age vs pain during coughing. To evaluate the frequency of side effects, the population was classified into three age groups (less than 40, 40-60, greater than 60 yr) and examined by Fisher's exact test for possible differences. Although there was wide interpatient variability, there was a correlation between patient age and effective 24-hr morphine dose (r = -0.40, P less than 0.01). The relation is described by the following equation: 24-hr morphine dose (mg) = 18-age(0.15). The quality of analgesia did not diminish with the smaller doses administered to the older patients. The frequency of side effects did not differ significantly in the three age groups. These observations may be related to higher CSF morphine concentrations or to a greater analgesic effect from morphine absorbed systemically from the epidural space in older patients.\r"

Myocardial contractility was quantified by the end-systolic pressure-length relation (ESPL). When the mean aortic pressure was increased by 40% above the control value for a given concentration of inhalation agent, the end-diastolic volume increased and thereby maintained stroke work. However, as the end-tidal concentrations of the anesthetics increased, this compensatory mechanism became progressively more ineffective as a result of myocardial depression caused by the anesthetics. No evidence could be found of an improvement in myocardial contractility as the aortic pressure was increased. Mild depression of myocardial contractility could be demonstrated for 1.1 MAC halothane, 0.6 MAC enflurane, and 1.0 MAC isoflurane. Severe depression of contractility occurred at 2.3 MAC halothane, 1.2 MAC enflurane, and 1.5 MAC isoflurane.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with phenobarbital and exposed for 1 hr to 12% O2 and no anesthesia (control) or to 1.2 MAC of one of three anesthetics: I-653, isoflurane, or halothane. Liver, kidney, and lung specimens were taken 24 hr after exposure concluded. The livers of all rats given halothane (n = 6) had swelling (20.5 +/- 5.7% of a lobule [mean +/- SD]) and centrilobular necrosis (6.7 +/- 2.1% of a lobule). Isoflurane produced only slight injury (6.7 +/- 3.5% swelling and 1.0 +/- 0.0% necrosis in 3 of 15 rats). No hepatic injury occurred in control rats (n = 20) or in those given I-653 (n = 16). Pulmonary and renal injury were not evident with any agent. Results suggest that I-653 has equivalent or less effect on hepatic, renal, and pulmonary integrity than currently available inhaled anesthetics.\r"

After the induction of general anesthesia, CO2 was added to the inspiratory gas mixture. After 15 min, ventilation with addition of CO2 (PaCO2 8-9 kPa) isoflurane (3%) was added. Hemodynamic measurements were made to study the effects of acute hypercapnia and the effects of isoflurane during hypercapnia. The addition of carbon dioxide resulted in increases in cardiac output, systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressures, and right and left ventricular stroke work. The addition of isoflurane during hypercapnia decreased systemic arterial blood pressure, but pulmonary arterial blood pressure was unaffected, cardiac output and stroke volume did not change, and left but not right ventricular stroke work decreased. In conclusion, acute pulmonary hypertension induced by hypercapnia was not affected by isoflurane but, despite increased right ventricular stroke work, there were no signs of right ventricular failure.\r"

Right ventricular strips were mounted in oxygenated Krebs' solution and stimulated with supramaximal voltages at 1.0 Hz, while isometric force of contraction was continuously recorded. Halothane (0.4, 0.7, and 1.1%) caused a significant dose-dependent depression of both peak developed tension (42, 61, and 70%, respectively) and maximum rate of rise of isometric tension (40, 56, and 64%, respectively) of newborn myocardium. Newborn myocardial preparations exhibited approximately 20% greater depression of contractility than adult myocardium at each concentration studied (P less than 0.05), thus a parallel shift of the dose-response curves was observed. It was concluded that halothane exerts a potent depressant effect on newborn myocardium that is greater than that on adult myocardium. The depression effect of halothane on the newborn myocardium may contribute to its hypotensive effect in newborn infants.\r"

The study was performed on ten individuals with various chronic pain syndromes. Tactile sensitivity was measured in the normal skin area with the use of von Frey filaments and a two-alternative forced-choice procedure with a staircase presentation of touch stimuli. With stellate ganglion block, touch threshold decreased on the side of the block by 48.8 +/- 8.% (P = 0.002) without any significant change in the threshold on the healthy, nonblocked side (P = 0.003 for the difference between the sides). With epidural sympathetic block, touch threshold decreased to the same extent on the diseased and healthy sides, which were both affected by the block (46.2 +/- 11.4%, P = 0.027 and 47.7 +/- 12.5%, P = 0.032, respectively). The results show that sympathetic blockade increases tactile sensitivity. They also suggest that sympathetic efferent activity modulates the function of tactile receptors. It is hypothesized that the sympathetic modulation makes tactile receptors less sensitive to touch, less specific, and probably more prone to code tactile stimuli in such a way that the brain recognizes this code as pain.\r"

A reversible decrease in the action potential amplitude of A fibers in desheathed nerves was observed after exposure to 100 micrograms/ml of each drug. The action potential amplitude of C fibers was also decreased but not to the same degree as was the A fiber action potential. Pretreatment with naloxone failed to block the reduction in action potential amplitude produced by the two opiates. No evidence of irreversible conduction blockade indicative of local neural toxicity was seen in these studies.

No dogs given enflurane anesthesia developed arrhythmias. Serum potassium levels increased significantly 3 and 5 min after succinylcholine in all groups. Serum epinephrine levels increased in the halothane-hypoxia:hypercarbia and enflurane:hypoxia groups and, after the injection of succinylcholine, epinephrine levels increased further in dogs in the halothane:control, halothane:hypoxia, halothane-hypoxia:hypercarbia, enflurane:hypoxia, and enflurane-hypoxia:hypercarbia groups.

Both agents were absorbed at all temperatures tested (0, 20, 40, and 60 degrees C). Absorption of isoflurane into a molecular sieve-like portion of dry soda lime was 30% (40 degrees C) to 115% (0 degrees C) greater than that of I-653. Similarly, the quasipartition coefficient for dry soda lime was 18% (0 degrees C) to 212% (20 degrees C) greater with isoflurane than with I-653. Degradation rates for the two anesthetics were comparable, although slightly higher for I-653 than for isoflurane. Fractional degradation rates for both agents increased with increasing temperature and decreased as the concentration of agent increased.\r"
