  ".W": "Many neurotransmitters, hormones and growth factors act at membrane receptors to stimulate the phosphodiesteratic hydrolysis of phosphatidyl-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate generating the comessengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol stimulates protein kinase C3 while Ins(1,4,5)P3 is postulated to activate specific receptors leading to release of intracellular calcium, probably from the endoplasmic reticulum. In recent preliminary reports, Rubin and associates detected 32P-Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to liver and adrenal microsomes and to permeabilized neutrophils and liver cells. We now report the biochemical and autoradiographic demonstration in brain of high affinity, selective binding sites for 3H- and 32P-labelled Ins(1,4,5)P3 at levels 100-300 times higher than those observed in peripheral tissues. The potencies of various myoinositol analogues at the Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding site correspond to their potencies in releasing calcium from microsomes, supporting the physiological relevance of this receptor. Brain autoradiograms demonstrate discrete, heterogeneous localization of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors. In some regions localizations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors resemble those of protein kinase C14, while in others they differ markedly, suggesting a novel mechanism whereby the relative activity of the two limbs of the PI cycle can be differently regulated.\r"

There was bilateral retinal reattachment, clearing of vitritis and regression of retinal exudates and hemorrhages, with concomitant resolution of viral shedding in urine and blood, on ganciclovir 7.5 mg/kg per day. There was recurrence of exudative detachments, vitritis and retinitis when the dose was reduced to 2.5 mg/kg per day, and regression of these findings when the dose was again increased to 7.5 mg/kg per day.

Stimulation effects were evaluated by neuropsychologic testing, endocrine studies, positron emission tomographic measurements of regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, EEG and evoked potentials. During stimulation, vital signs and pupillary diameter increased and a left hemiparesis and left hemisensory loss developed. Verbal functions deteriorated and visuospatial processing improved. Plasma growth hormone concentrations decreased, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone and cortisol levels rose. With stimulation, glucose metabolism increased in both thalami and both hemispheres, reversing baseline right-sided hypometabolism and right-left asymmetries. EEG and both somatosensory and brain-stem auditory evoked potentials remained unchanged during stimulation, while visual evoked potentials revealed evidence of anterior visual pathway dysfunction in the left eye. This case establishes the potential for addiction to deep brain stimulation and demonstrates that widespread behavioral and physiological changes, with concomitant alteration in the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, may accompany unilateral thalamic stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Among children less than 12 years of age residing in Dallas County, Texas, and in the state of Minnesota we conducted prospective, active surveillance of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease. During 18 months, 616 cases were identified, of which 600 were caused by type b organisms. The annual incidence of disease was significantly greater in Dallas than in Minnesota (109 v 68/100,000 children younger than 5 years of age, P less than .001) and was greater in Dallas, even when rates for white children in the two regions were compared (P less than .001). Other regional differences were observed. In Dallas, a larger proportion of cases were in children attending day-care centers (27% compared with 12% in Minnesota, P less than .001) and more patients attended day care for greater than 40 h/wk (56% compared with 30% in Minnesota, P less than .001). Outer membrane protein subtyping of isolates revealed that in Dallas 6U isolates were associated significantly with cases in black children who attended day care. In Minnesota, but not in Dallas, isolates with subtype 1H were associated significantly with cases in children in day care. These data indicate that there are regional differences in the epidemiology of type b Haemophilus disease that may relate to differences in strains, day-care practices, or other unknown cultural or environmental factors. Finally, because only 15% of systemic Haemophilus disease in these regions occurred in children in the age groups recommended for vaccination (24 to 59 months), the new Haemophilus type b polysaccharide vaccine is expected to have a limited impact on the overall incidence of disease.\r"

  ".W": "The impact of alcohol and marijuana abuse on the physical health and nutritional status of adolescents has not been well documented. The health consequences of alcoholism and chemical abuse in adults may not relate to the pediatric population. Forty-nine adolescent boys (mean age 15.8 years) with varying degrees of alcohol and marijuana use by self-report were evaluated as to their general health, pubertal development and nutritional status using health and dietary history, physical examination, anthropometrics, and biochemical assays of liver function and tissue nutrients. Thirteen (27%) were alcohol and marijuana abusers, 20 (41%) marijuana abusers, and 16 (32%) nonusers. There were significant differences between alcohol and marijuana abusers and marijuana abusers compared to nonusers with respect to endorsing symptoms of nutritional deficiency (muscle weakness, bleeding gums, tiredness, etc) (P less than .001). There were no significant differences between subgroups in other nutritional measures except plasma zinc concentration which was low in marijuana abusers (mean 85 micrograms/dL). All adolescents reported consuming adequate nutrients, although alcohol and marijuana abusers reported eating more snack foods and less fruit, vegetables, and milk than other groups. There were no significant differences in hematologic status (complete blood cell count, transferrin, folate), liver function (gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase), or anthropometric and sexual maturational indices of growth. There were no chronic signs of chemical abuse by physical examinations. It appears that health and nutritional disability from chemical abuse in adolescents relates more to poor dietary habits and symptomatic deterioration in general health than to specific effects on growth or nutritional status. Studies with larger numbers of subjects need to document these findings.\r"

  ".U": "87118222\r", 
  ".W": "The first step in the processing of 47S precursor rRNA in mouse cells is reproduced in vitro in an S-100 transcription reaction and consists of an endonucleolytic cleavage at residue +650 of the primary transcript followed by rapid degradation of the fragment upstream from residue +650. An analogous processing occurs in human rRNA. The mouse and human rRNA sequences are approximately equal to 80% conserved for 200 nucleotides on the 3' side of these processing sites, suggesting that this conserved region may be important in specifying the processing. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a systematic series of deletion mutants approaching the mouse rDNA processing region from both the 5' and 3' directions and analyzed the processing of their transcripts in vitro. The 5' boundary of the region required for processing is quite sharp and corresponds to the rRNA cleavage site at the 5' end of the conserved sequence region. The 3' boundary is more complex: The 3' deletions extending to between 250 and 130 nucleotides beyond the processing site cause about a 50% decrease in the amount of the processed RNA. A 3' deletion that extends to 109 nucleotides beyond the processing site greatly reduces the processing efficiency. Deletions to or beyond 91 nucleotides on the 3' side of the processing site virtually eliminate processing. Under altered ionic conditions, transcripts of 3' deletions extending to only 41 nucleotides beyond the processing site can still direct a low level of accurate processing. These results demonstrate that the mouse/human conserved sequence just on the 3' side of the primary rRNA processing site consists of several domains that direct and/or augment both the initial endonucleolytic cleavage and the closely coupled selective degradation of the upstream fragment that together constitute the primary rRNA processing event.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of ethanol to rabbits is known to induce a unique liver microsomal cytochrome P-450, termed isozyme 3a or P-450ALC, which is responsible for the increased oxidation of ethanol and other alcohols and the activation of toxic or carcinogenic compounds such as acetaminophen and N-nitrosodimethylamine. To further characterize this cytochrome P-450 we have identified cDNA clones to isozyme 3a by immunoscreening, DNA hybridization, and hybridization-selection. The cDNA sequence determined from two overlapping clones contains an open reading frame of 1416 nucleotides, and the first 25 amino acids of this reading frame correspond to residues 21-45 of cytochrome P-450 3a. The complete polypeptide, including residues 1 to 20, contains 492 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 56,820. Cytochrome P-450 3a is approximately 55% identical in sequence to P-450 isozymes 1 and 3b and 48% identical to isozyme 2. Hybridization of clone p3a-2 to electrophoretically fractionated rabbit liver poly(A)+ RNA revealed multiple bands, but, with a probe derived from the 3' nontranslated portion of this cDNA, only a 1.9-kilobase band was observed. Treatment of rabbits with imidazole, which increases the content of isozyme 3a, resulted in a transient increase in form 3a mRNA, but this was judged to be insufficient to account for the known 4.5-fold increase in form 3a protein. Genomic DNA analysis indicated that the cytochrome P-450 3a gene does not belong to a large subfamily.\r"

  ".W": "The complete nucleotide sequence of the Bacillus subtilis dnaB gene and its flanking regions was determined. The dnaB gene is essential for both replication initiation and membrane attachment of the origin region of the chromosome and plasmid pUB110. It has been known that there are two different classes (dnaBI and dnaBII) in the dnaB mutants; dnaBI is essential for both chromosome and pUB110 replication, whereas dnaBII is necessary only for chromosome replication. The nucleotide sequence revealed that dnaBI and dnaBII are two functional domains in the single dnaB gene. The mutation sites of two mutants, belonging to dnaBI and dnaBII, respectively, were also determined as substitutions of amino acids. The putative DnaB protein deduced from nucleotide sequence consists of 472 amino acids (55 kDa) with no cysteine residue. A 55-kDa polypeptide produced in an in vitro transcription-translation system was labeled with [35S]methionine but not with [35S]cysteine. The DnaB protein has a highly hydrophobic sequence of 20 amino acids in its N-terminal region, a possible DNA binding site, and two possible ATP binding sites. The dnaBI domain is between the DNA binding site and one of the ATP binding sites; the dnaBII domain is close to the other ATP binding site. Comparison of the amino acid sequence between the \"dnaB protein\" and those of other dna genes of Escherichia coli showed no homology, suggesting that the dnaB gene of B. subtilis may be analogous to a hitherto undiscovered gene in E. coli.\r"

The amino acid sequence, deduced from the cDNA sequence, contained the sequence of eight peptides obtained by tryptic and cyanogen bromide fragmentation of rat liver AdoHcy hydrolase. Identification of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal peptides in the amino acid sequence showed that the complete sequence was obtained. A \"fingerprint\" sequence was found that is characteristic of dinucleotide-binding domains of many proteins. For AdoHcy hydrolase, this region from the lysine at position 213 to the aspartate at position 244, containing the sequence Gly-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gly at positions 219-224, is presumably the site of binding for NAD+, which is required for the activity of the enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "DNAs from hamster embryo cells and mouse C3H/10T1/2 cells transformed in vitro by x-irradiation into malignant cells transmit the radiation transformation phenotype by producing transformed colonies (transfectants) in two mouse recipient lines, the NIH 3T3 and C3H/101/2 cells, and in a rat cell line, the Rat-2 cells. DNAs from unirradiated cells or irradiated and visibly untransformed cells do not produce transformed colonies. The transfectants grow in agar and form tumors in nude mice. Treatment of the DNAs with restriction endonucleases prior to transfection indicates that the same transforming gene (oncogene) is present in each of the transformed mouse cells and is the same in each of the transformed hamster cells. Southern blot analysis of 3T3 or Rat-2 transfectants carrying oncogenes from radiation-transformed C3H/10T1/2 or hamster cells indicates that the oncogenes responsible for the transformation of 3T3 cells are not the Ki-ras, Ha-ras, or N-ras genes, nor are they neu, trk, raf, abl, or fms, although quick blot analysis using 11 oncogene probes detected increased transcripts of c-abl and c-fms in the 3T3 transformants containing oncogenic sequences from the x-ray-transformed C3H/10T1/2 cells. The work demonstrates that DNAs from mammalian cells transformed into malignancy by direct exposure in vitro to radiation contain genetic sequences with detectable transforming activity in three recipient cell lines. The results provide evidence that DNA is the target of radiation carcinogenesis induced at a cellular level in vitro. The experiments indicate that malignant radiogenic transformation in vitro of hamster embryo and mouse C3H/10T1/2 cells involves the activation of unique non-ras transforming genes, which heretofore have not been described.\r"

  ".W": "We report the establishment of a spontaneous interleukin 1 (IL-1)-producing subclone derived from the human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-containing B-lymphoblastoid cell line (721 LCL) and show that the IL-1 produced by this B-cell subclone is distinct from other types of IL-1. The parental cell line 84.5, a deletion mutant of the 721 LCL cell line, can be induced to produce IL-1 activity when stimulated by certain inducers such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the presence of fetal calf serum. From this parental 721/84.5 clone, a subclone, termed 3B6, has been developed. This 3B6 subclone has an immature B-cell phenotype, expresses only HLA class II DP subregion antigens, and spontaneously releases IL-1 in the culture supernatant with relatively few inhibitory molecules under serum-free culture conditions. The 3B6-derived IL-1 was purified from 3B6 conditioned medium with a three-step procedure. The molecular weight of this IL-1 is 13,500, and the isoelectric point values are pH 4.9 and 5.1 without any component focusing near pH 7. The N-terminal amino acid sequence differs markedly from those reported for the two IL-1 species produced by monocytes. The purified material shares several biological properties with monocyte IL-1, since it could induce the proliferation of murine thymocytes, the production of interleukin 2 by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cloned HSB2 T cells, and the proliferation of human fibroblasts. However, this IL-1 activity could not be blocked by polyclonal anti-monocytic IL-1 antibodies, and, more importantly, it was not pyrogenic in rabbits. Finally, it promotes the growth of B-cell clones derived from the parental 721/84.5 lines in the absence of fetal calf serum, which suggests that it could act as an autocrine growth factor in this Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated expression of an IgE-binding factor (IgE-BF) cDNA in both COS-7 monkey kidney cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Transient expression of the IgE-BF clone in either cell type yielded IgE-BF, which potentiated an in vitro IgE response and had an affinity for lentil lectin. In contrast, when the transient expression experiments were carried out in the presence of tunicamycin, the factors no longer bound to lentil lectin. Moreover, IgE-BF expressed under these conditions suppressed an in vitro IgE response. IgE-BF lacking affinity for lentil lectin and suppressing the IgE response also resulted from transient expression of the IgE-BF gene in the presence of glycosylation inhibiting factor, a phospholipase inhibitory protein. Thus, IgE-BF that either potentiate or suppress the IgE response can be expressed from a single cloned gene; the difference in biological activities appears to be determined principally by the type of glycosylation of the common polypeptide chain. Previous work showed that IgE-BF bears an antigenic determinant recognized by the anti-Ia monoclonal antibody OX3. IgE-BF produced in the presence of tunicamycin, and IgE-BF expressed from a mutant cDNA lacking one of two carbohydrate-attachment sites, lacked the OX3 determinant. Thus, the OX3 determinant on IgE-BF appears to be associated with a site of N-linked glycosylation.\r"

  ".U": "87118256\r", 
  ".W": "Clonal expansion of T lymphocytes of the helper/inducer class is generally thought to be mediated by an interleukin 2 (IL-2)-dependent autocrine mechanism. Thus, T cells stimulated by antigens or mitogenic lectins secrete IL-2 and, under appropriate conditions, express membrane receptors for IL-2, and the specific hormone-receptor interaction induces cellular proliferation. Recent studies indicate that B-cell stimulatory factor 1 (BSF-1) is secreted by T cells and is capable of stimulating T-cell proliferation. We now report that BSF-1 and not IL-2 is the sole autocrine growth factor for certain cloned lines of inducer T lymphocytes. On stimulation by the lectin concanavalin A, anti-receptor antibody, or specific antigen with antigen-presenting cells, such clones secrete a lymphokine that stimulates DNA synthesis by the \"IL-2 indicator line,\" HT2, but is identified as BSF-1 by specific inhibition with monoclonal antibodies. The proliferative response of such BSF-1-secreting clones to receptor-mediated signals is dependent on BSF-1 and not IL-2. These results demonstrate a function of BSF-1 and confirm the existence of a previously unknown autocrine pathway of T-cell activation.\r"

The cDNA library was constructed from RNA isolated from the rostral portion of the rat corpus striatum, the site of striatonigral cell bodies. Two types of cDNAs were isolated and defined by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing to encode both substance P and neurokinin A. The two predicted preprotachykinin protein precursors (130 and 115 amino acids in length) differ from each other by a pentadecapeptide sequence between the two tachykinin sequences, and both precursors possess appropriate processing signals for substance P and neurokinin A production. The presence of a third preprotachykinin mRNA of minor abundance in rat striatum was established by S1 nuclease protection experiments. This mRNA encodes a preprotachykinin of 112 amino acids containing substance P but not neurokinin A. These three mRNAs are derived from one rat gene as a result of differential RNA processing; thus, this RNA processing pattern further increases the diversity of products that can be generated from the preprotachykinin gene.\r"

When one branch was occluded for 10 min (11 patients), there was insignificant increase of the flow through the nonoccluded branch. The mean joint graft flow and branch flow increased insignificantly after administration of dipyridamole. Lower blood flow in one branch of the sequential graft than in the joint graft is due to insufficient collateral system. High rate of flow in the joint graft probably reduces the rate of early and late occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of immunodominant peptides derived from several antigen systems to compete with each other for T cell activation was studied. Only peptides restricted by a given transplantation antigen are mutually competitive. There is a correlation between haplotype restriction, ability to bind to the appropriate transplantation antigen, and ability to inhibit activation of other T cells restricted by the same transplantation antigen. An exception was noted in that a peptide derived from an antigen, bacteriophage lambda cI repressor, binds to the I-Ed molecule in a specific way, yet is not I-Ed-restricted. Comparison of the sequence of the repressor peptide with that of other peptides able to bind to (and be restricted by) I-Ed and a polymorphic region of the I-Ed molecule itself revealed a significant degree of homology. Thus, peptides restricted by a given class II molecule appear to be homologous to a portion of the class II molecule itself. The repressor-derived peptide is identical at several polymorphic residues at this site, and this may account for the failure of I-Ed to act as a restriction element. Comparison of antigenic peptide sequences with transplantation antigen sequences suggests a model that provides a basis for explaining self, nonself discrimination as well as alloreactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) types I and II are unusual among replication-competent retroviruses in that they contain a fourth gene (chi) necessary for replication. The chi gene product, p chi, transcriptionally transactivates the viral long repeat (LTR), and is thus a positive regulator. To investigate p chi transactivation, sequences from the U3 regions of the LTRs of HTLV-I and -II were inserted into the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) LTR by recombinant DNA techniques. Transient expression assays of the chimeric LTRs indicated that the HTLV sequences conferred to the M-MuLV LTR responsiveness to HTLV p chi protein. M-MuLV enhancers were not required for function of the chimeric LTRs. Infectious recombinant M-MuLVs containing chimeric LTRs were also generated. These viruses showed higher infectivity when assayed in mouse cells expressing HTLV-II p chi protein compared to normal mouse cells. Thus the HTLV sequences were able to confer p chi responsiveness to infectious M-MuLV. The generation of a virus dependent on a transactivating protein for its replication has implications for the evolution of the human T-cell leukemia viruses.\r"

The measurements were performed with subjects at rest, without sensory deprivation. The values of rCBF, rOEF, rCMRO2 and rCBV in more than 40 anatomical structures of the brain were evaluated by studying a large series of scans in each region of interest after the functional PET image had been anatomically identified using x-ray computed tomographic images corresponding to the PET. In mean gray values, only CMRO2 showed significant reduction with age. rCMRO2 significantly decreased with age only in the supratentrium, and much more in the left hemisphere. Especially remarkable was rCMRO2 reduction in the left caudate region. Both CBF and OEF were variable and less age-dependent.

  ".W": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by xenon-133 inhalation tomography in 18 patients with cerebrovascular disease before and 4 months after extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery. Only patients who showed a reduced CBF in areas that were intact on the CT scan and relevant to the clinical and angiographical findings were operated. The majority of the patients had suffered a minor stroke with or without subsequent transient ischemic attacks. They were studied at least 6 weeks following the stroke. All patients had an occlusion of the relevant internal carotid artery. To identify preoperatively the patients with a compromised collateral circulation and hence reduced CBF due to reduced perfusion pressure, a cerebral vasodilatory stress test was performed using acetazolamide (Diamox). In normal subjects, Diamox has been shown to increase tomographic CBF without change of the flow distribution. In the present series 9 patients showed a significant redistribution of flow in favor of the non-occluded side (\"positive\" Diamox test). Two of these 9 patients showed even a paradoxical decrease in focal CBF preoperatively, i.e., a \"steal\" effect. These 2 patients were the only patients who improved in focal CBF after shunting. The remaining 9 patients all showed uniform flow responses (\"negative\" Diamox test), and none of these increased in focal CBF postoperatively. The finding of an unchanged flow map postoperatively confirmed that the low flow areas were not due to restricted flow via collateral pathways. However, an increase in the regional vasodilatory capacity was observed postoperatively in the majority of patients.\r"

  ".U": "87121311\r", 
  ".W": "Cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism have been measured with the steady-state oxygen-15 technique and positron emission tomography in anesthetized dogs. Regional microembolization was induced by infusing Sephadex particles (diameter, 40 micron) into one of the common carotid arteries. In the first series of experiments, 2.5 mg Sephadex was infused, and the dogs were examined within 3-4 hours after embolization. In a second series 0.55 mg Sephadex was infused, and the dogs were examined either in the first 3-4 hours or 24-48 hours after embolization. Cerebral blood flow, oxygen extraction ratio, and cerebral oxygen utilization were measured at 3 PCO2 levels. In the acute experiments, cerebral oxygen utilization in the embolized hemisphere was 6 (0.55 mg Sephadex) and 25% (2.5 mg Sephadex) lower than on the contralateral side. While cerebral blood flow was symmetrically distributed in normocapnia and hypocapnia, it was 9 (0.55 mg Sephadex) and 35% (2.5 mg Sephadex) lower in the embolized hemisphere during hypercapnia. In normocapnia and hypocapnia the lower oxygen utilization in the embolized hemisphere was characterized by a lower oxygen extraction ratio, and in hypercapnia by an unchanged (0.55 mg Sephadex) or by a higher (2.5 mg Sephadex) extraction ratio. The different effect on oxygen extraction ratio in the control and embolized hemispheres resulted in images of uncoupling between perfusion and oxygen demand that varied according to the PCO2. The experiments also showed a fall in cerebral blood flow in the embolized hemisphere after 3-4 hours, indicating delayed hypoperfusion. After 24-48 hours, blood flow was about 10% higher in the embolized hemisphere, and this was observed at the 3 PCO2 levels, while the oxygen extraction ratio was systematically lower. Oxygen utilization in the embolized hemisphere was depressed to practically the same extent as in acute experiments. It can be concluded that between 4 and 24 hours after microembolization the cerebral microcirculation shows important changes, with installation of luxury perfusion in the face of an unchanging decreased oxygen metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen chronic cerebral infarcts were investigated by a highly sensitive, dedicated brain single photon emission computerized tomography system using 123I-isopropyl iodoamphetamine (IMP) and 133Xe. IMP uptake was measured 10 minutes, 2 hours, and 5 hours after injection, and regional cerebral blood flow was measured with 133Xe. In 4 cases a positron emission tomography system was used to measure the rCBF and the regional metabolic rate of oxygen with C15O2 and 15O2. The results obtained allowed us to identify 2 abnormal zones. One, the \"central area,\" was characterized by a severe decrease in IMP uptake and rCBF averaging 34% and 46% respectively and by a hypodense image on the x-ray computerized tomography scan. The second, the periinfarct or \"peripheral area\" was characterized by a moderate decrease in IMP uptake and regional cerebral blood flow averaging 13 and 19% respectively; this area extended around the central area and had a normal density on computerized tomography scan. The IMP hypofixation of the peripheral area observed at the 10th minute tended to disappear at the 5th hour. The volume of this area was often found to be quite large, covering more than 30% of a hemisphere whereas the central area did not exceed 25%. Volume appeared to be correlated with the neurological status of the patient. The nature of the peripheral area is not established with certainty. It may be caused by deafferentation of areas not directly affected by the ischemic insult and/or selective ischemic neuronal loss. The results stress the important role played by the peripheral area, which may be useful in establishing the prognosis and evaluating the efficacy of therapy in individual stroke cases.\r"

Biological false positives (BFP) occurred at a rate of approximately 0.5 percent using each antigen source. However, distinct populations of BFP donors were detected when the two antigen sources were compared. Results indicate that at least two separate sets of antigens are recognized in ELISA by our normal population and result in BFP. Sequential utilization of tests using these distinct sources adds a second discriminator to identification of BFP, with the potential for decreasing the requirement for Western blot analysis.\r"

This finding is in contrast to the high levels of both C3d and immune complexes in SLE. The discrepancy may be caused by a lack of immune complex mediated complement activation by the procainamide induced antibodies, or may be due to a difference in severity of disease. The acetylator phenotype of the patients was determined but due to the low frequency of fast acetylators no comparison of the immunological response of the two phenotypes could be done.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of infection and reflux on the diameter of the ureter at excretory urography in children with acute, febrile urinary tract infections and in infants with bacteriuria found at screening. Standardized measurements of ureteral diameter were obtained for 79 children (2 months to 6 years old) with urinary tract infections and for 45 infants with bacteriuria. Patients with urinary tract obstruction or malformations were excluded. Seventy-one children with febrile urinary tract infection had ureteral visualization that allowed measurements. Ureteral diameter in this group was significantly wider than in a reference group, and 42 children (59%) had ureteral diameters that were more than 2 standard deviations above the normal mean. Ureteral diameter at excretory urography increased with increasing grades of reflux, but dilatation occurred also in the absence of reflux. Twenty-two of the 45 infants in the group with bacteriuria had sufficient ureteral visualization for measurements. The ureters in this group were wider than in the reference group, and eight infants had ureteral diameters that were more than 2 standard deviations above the normal mean. We conclude that ureteral dilatation is a common effect of acute urinary tract infection and bacteriuria in children.\r"

Voiding cystourethrograms and excretory urograms of 560 girls referred for evaluation of urinary tract infections were reviewed retrospectively. Duplex collecting systems (complete and partial) were found in 8%. Vesicoureteral reflux was seen in 69% of complete duplex systems and in 22% of partial duplex systems. Parenchymal scarring was evident in 17% of those girls with complete duplication and in 6% of those with incomplete duplication. The statistics for girls with partial duplication were very similar to those for girls with urinary tract infection and nonduplex systems. These data indicated that girls with partial duplex systems clinically appear similar to those girls with anatomically normal systems. Girls with complete duplex systems had a higher prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux and associated anomalies, indicating a need for closer follow-up and/or surgical intervention.\r"

Expressed as a mean fraction of the preinfusion controls, the postinfusion physiologic values were pulmonary artery pressure = 0.89 mm Hg, pulmonary vascular resistance = 0.68 mm Hg X min/L, cardiac output = 1.36 L/min, central venous pressure = 0.77 cm H2O, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure = 0.92 mm Hg, PAO2/FlO2 = 1.08, and shunt fraction = 0.95.

Six areas of the lung in each patient were assessed by both techniques for profusion (number) of opacities (small nodules), coalescence, and the presence of large opacities. CT scans and chest radiographs yielded similar average scores for detection of opacities. CT identified significantly more coalescence and large opacities in patients with simple silicosis. In patients with complicated silicosis, CT results were comparable with those of chest radiographs. CT of the thorax in workers exposed to silica does not identify more patients with minimal parenchymal disease, but it does detect earlier changes of coalescence.\r"

The anterior mediastinum was analyzed on imaging studies for thymic morphology and the presence of mass lesions, and the findings were then correlated with the results of surgical resection and pathologic examination. The chest radiographs detected an anterior mediastinal mass in two patients consistent with thymoma on subsequent CT and MR examinations. Chest radiographs in the other 14 patients were normal. In seven patients with a final diagnosis of thymic hyperplasia, both CT and MR demonstrated normal thymic morphology in five, an enlarged thymus in one, and a small thymus in one that was easily identified on CT but was difficult to define on MR. In the other seven patients with a normal thymus on pathologic examination, both CT and MR showed an involuted thymus in four, a normal thymus in two, and an enlarged thymus in one. While both CT and MR were superior to chest radiography for studying the thymus, CT provided better spatial resolution and thymic definition in a much shorter scanning time than MR did. This study suggests that CT should remain the procedure of choice when further imaging of the thymus is needed after the initial chest radiographs in patients with myasthenia gravis.\r"

Although more older women had lucent parenchyma, 37% of women more than 50 years of age had dense patterns. Thus, these factors cannot be used to predict radiographic density. Phototiming is required to maintain image quality, and only a test exposure can accurately predict breast density.\r"

The primary tumors exhibited central areas of low attenuation representing tumor necrosis (n = 26), irregular contrast enhancement (n = 16), detectable calcification (n = 9), and a thin, capsulelike rim surrounding the tumor (n = 7). Tumors metastasized to liver (n = 9), lung (n = 5), and lymph nodes (n = 5). In eight of nine cases of liver metastasis the primary tumor arose in the left adrenal gland. Evidence of endocrinopathy was present in each of nine patients with lesions 6 cm or less in diameter, but in only two of seven adults with lesions exceeding 15 cm in diameter. We conclude that, contrary to established concepts, adrenocortical carcinoma may present as a smooth, homogeneous, functioning mass 6 cm or less in diameter on CT.\r"

Patient management was altered in only one patient as a result of the additional information provided by CT. The contrast enema should remain the initial and routine examination for the evaluation of patients with suspected diverticulitis.

All images were compared with corresponding cryomicrotome sections from cadaver shoulders. The rotator cuff was analyzed in detail. It appeared as a complex, heterogeneous band to tissue superficial to the humeral head. The areas of low signal intensity corresponded to the central tendons of the four rotator cuff muscles. These tendons could be distinguished from each other as well as from the intervening components of the cuff, which have a moderate intensity. We concluded that MR is capable of imaging the normal rotator cuff and of separating the various components. This may allow for improved precision in the diagnosis of rotator cuff disorders.\r"

The seventh nerve was followed in the internal auditory and fallopian canal and through temporal bone to the stylomastoid foramen. The entire labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid portions, as well as the geniculate ganglion, could be shown with appropriate scan planes. MR produces excellent images of the facial nerve with high-contrast resolution. Unlike CT, no beam-hardening artifact from the temporal bone is apparent.

  ".W": "Newer methods of radiation therapy for treating oligodendroglioma after surgical resection have produced promising results using high doses of radiation. However, these doses are close to those that cause necrosis of normal brain, making the accurate spatial localization of tissue at risk for containing tumor cells more important. Because MR imaging is superior to CT in detecting some types of intracranial disease, nine patients with oligodendroglioma were studied with both MR and CT. Results were compared with surgical findings. In six cases, MR identified some tumor volume found during surgery that was not detected by CT. In addition, the interface between abnormality (tumor plus edema) and normality was depicted much more clearly by MR than by CT in most cases. Such superior depiction of the margins of abnormality is important for radiation therapy planning because of the known tendency of oligodendroglioma to infiltrate adjacent edema, making all areas of abnormality potential tumor-bearing tissue. Finally, MR showed normal brain tissue in areas considered suspicious by CT, because they were not well seen on CT in several patients. In these cases of low-grade oligodendroglioma, MR was believed to be superior to CT in providing information needed for radiation therapy planning because of its ability to distinguish tumor and adjacent edema (considered tissue at risk for containing microscopic tumor) from contiguous normal brain.\r"

Sixty-seven orbital wall fractures with intact orbital rims (36 floor, 22 medial wall, nine roof) were identified in 47 orbits. Since persistent diplopia and/or enophthalmos may warrant surgical repair of orbital floor fractures, optimal imaging should include an evaluation of extraocular muscle status, the nature and amount of displaced orbital contents, and an accurate definition of fracture margins. For orbital floor fractures, a combination of the direct oblique sagittal and direct coronal projections optimally displayed all fracture margins, the fracture's relationship to the inferior orbital rim and medial orbital wall, and the amount of displacement into the maxillary sinus. Inferior rectus muscle status with 36 floor fractures was best seen on the direct oblique sagittal projection in 30 fractures (83.3%) and was equally well seen on sagittal and coronal projections in two fractures (5.5%). Floor fractures were missed on 100% of axial, 5.5% of sagittal, and 0% of coronal projections. Since the direct oblique sagittal projection complements the direct coronal projection in evaluating orbital floor fractures, it should not be performed alone. A technical approach to the CT evaluation or orbital wall fractures is presented.\r"

Although abdominal organs were well seen with 2-sec scan time, overall evaluation of these organs was better on routine T1-weighted images. Vascular structures, however, were seen as well or better on the 2-sec images in 60% of cases. The images were extremely sensitive to field nonhomogeneity, and metallic artifact was exaggerated in five patients with surgical clips. Two-sec MR images provide a rapid method of localizing abdominal organs for further evaluation. The sensitivity to blood flow may assist in the assessment of vascular patency.\r"

Taking into account a patient's age, coronary anatomy, degree of ischemia and left ventricular function, one can use available data to define the expectations for bypass surgery with reasonable accuracy. If important ischemia is present and the coronary anatomy is favorable, bypass surgery should improve the patient's quality of life and may significantly enhance survival.\r"

Follow-up averaged 96.16 months/patient. Actuarial freedom from reoperation was 100% at 12 months, 95% at 60 months, and 89.4% at 120 months. Actuarial freedom from cardiac death was 100% at 12 months, 94% at 60 months, and 87% at 120 months. Actuarial freedom from an LAD graft failure myocardial event was 100% at 12 month, 94% at 60 months, and 77% at 120 months. Our SVBG failure rate did increase from 1.2%/year during the first 5 years to 3.4%/year during the second 5 years. We are presently selectively employing IMA grafts to the LAD. Our results with the SVBG and the palliative nature of all coronary artery bypass graft procedures remove the imperative to always use the IMA. Individual patient considerations such as age, clinical stability, IMA flow, and the residual anatomy for the potential reoperation are important considerations.\r"

Forty-nine coronary events occurred in the 276 men who performed the exercise test during the following year, whereas only 5 coronary events occurred among the 118 women. The only variable of prognostic importance in women was nontransmural myocardial infarction. In men, the clinical variables increasing age, duration of angina, ST- or T-segment changes on the rest electrocardiogram and increasing angina or nontransmural myocardial infarction as inclusion criteria were associated with increased occurrence of coronary artery bypass surgery, transmural myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Findings of ST-segment depression, limiting chest pain or low rate-pressure product during the exercise test were of greater value than any clinical variable in prediction of coronary artery bypass surgery, transmural myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Within all clinical subgroups of men, the results of the exercise test had an additive predictive value for future coronary events. Combinations of clinical data and exercise test results enabled the best identification of patients with high or low risk for coronary events.\r"

Compared with control group, only the presence of eccentric lesions (72% vs 24%) and intimal tears (78% vs 34%) was more predominant in the group with acute occlusion. Redilation was attempted in 31 patients and was successful in 27 (87%). Nine of these patients eventually required coronary bypass surgery and 18 were discharged and followed for 11 to 34 months (mean 18). Thus, redilation is a safe and effective approach to manage patients in whom coronary occlusion develops after PTCA.\r"

We studied lymphocyte subsets in 27 patients with chronic hepatitis B utilizing standard monoclonal antibodies including Leu 1,2a,3a,7 and D1/12 (against the common determinant of the Dr molecule), as well as a newly described monoclonal antibody, \"5/9,\" which is thought to characterize a unique subpopulation of T4 cells with specific helper/inducer function. These results were compared with those obtained using the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction assay for the same patients in order to further delineate the lymphocyte alterations in chronic hepatitis B. A significant reduction in the mean number of Leu 3a (T4) positive cells was observed as well as a reduction in the number of 5/9 positive cells. These changes were most evident in those positive for HBeAg in serum. Reduction in Leu 3a cells was associated with a reduced autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction assay response, and was most marked in the HBeAg-positive individuals. These findings suggest that HBeAg-positive patients in whom active viral replication is occurring have a defect in T lymphocyte number and function, which may be due in part to reduced 5/9 positive cells. These alterations may be related to the persistence of virus in chronic active hepatitis B patients.\r"

However, a barium meal study revealed an intussusception with a suspicious nodular lesion in the proximal jejunum as the leading edge, which, after laparotomy, was proven to be a metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and the cause of the gastrointestinal bleeding. The serosal side of this lesion was free from cancer involvement and there was no peritoneal implantation or lymph node involvement. The metastasis is probably hematogenous. The extremely unusual location involved by hepatocellular carcinoma in this patient signifies the ubiquitous nature of metastasis in this cancer.\r"

Basal plasma cortisol concentration was normal in end-stage renal disease; however, considering the corresponding elevated ACTH concentrations, cortisol levels were inadequately low. Thus, the hypothalamus as well as the adrenal gland seems to contribute to the alterations in HPA function observed in patients with chronic renal failure; involvement of the pituitary gland and effects of metabolic alterations cannot be ruled out.\r"

The two conditions were resting and activation, and an eye tracking task was used. Patients with more negative symptoms showed lower global metabolic rates and more severe hypofrontality than did the patients with fewer negative symptoms. Differences among the patients were distinguished by the task: sicker patients failed to show a metabolic activation response. These findings suggest that cerebral metabolic patterns reflect clinical characteristics of schizophrenic patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of enflurane (end-tidal concentration 0.7%) on central and coronary hemodynamics and myocardial oxygenation were studied during steady state, high-dose fentanyl anesthesia in ten patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting operations. Compared with the response in ten patients receiving the same fentanyl anesthesia (100 micrograms/kg) without enflurane supplementation, enflurane caused a moderate reduction in mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular stroke work index. No patient showed signs of myocardial ischemia, and mean coronary sinus flow and calculated coronary resistance remained unchanged. Surgical stimulation induced no central or coronary hemodynamic responses in the enflurane-fentanyl group. No coronary hemodynamic changes occurred in the fentanyl group, but a marked increase in arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance was seen. Myocardial oxygen extraction decreased in the enflurane supplemented group although it increased in the fentanyl group after surgical stimulation. Three fentanyl group patients and one enflurane-fentanyl group patient had a low myocardial lactate extraction as a sign of myocardial ischemia during surgery. We conclude that a 0.7% enflurane supplementation of 100 micrograms/kg fentanyl anesthesia does not endanger myocardial oxygenation and effectively prevents central and coronary hemodynamic responses to skin incision and sternotomy in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery.\r"

  ".U": "87125868\r", 
  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects of esmolol were studied in 40 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery surgery to determine whether the administration of esmolol in chronically beta-blocked patients would result in additional attenuation of sympathetically mediated hemodynamic stress responses to noxious stimuli. Patients were randomly assigned to receive IV infusions of esmolol or 5% dextrose in water (D5W). All received their regular dose of beta-adrenergic blocker within 6 hr of surgery and were anesthetized with diazepam, pancuronium, and enflurane. Increases (greater than 25% above baseline) in systolic blood pressure were treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Esmolol was started before induction of anesthesia and continued until 5 min after maximal sternal spread. There were no statistically significant differences between the esmolol and control groups in any hemodynamic parameter during induction, intubation, skin incision, and sternotomy. Only at 5 min after maximal sternal spread was there a statistically significant lower systolic blood pressure in the esmolol-treated group. However the incidence and magnitude of SNP use in the control group was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater. Thus, the lower blood pressure, in the absence of changes in systemic vascular resistance, cardiac index, heart rate, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure points toward a decrease in myocardial contractility, suggesting that the addition of esmolol to chronically used beta-blockers resulted in an additional negative inotropic effect. We conclude that in patients with coronary artery disease in whom chronic beta-blocker therapy is continued until the time of surgery, esmolol does not further attenuate the heart rate response but does attenuate the increase in blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acetylation of procainamide results in the formation of N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) the propensity of which to induce SLE and to increase antinuclear antibodies is negligible while its antiarrhythmic properties remain. Slow acetylators of PA have a greater tendency to induce SLE consistent with the observation that it is the level of PA that is responsible for the observed immunologically-mediated side effects of the compound. This is also suggested by the remission of PA-induced SLE when PA is replaced with NAPA for the control of cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, NAPA, compared to the parent compound, has little tendency to induce SLE.\r"

The PTL airway was inserted in ten patients and the barium solution was instilled in the nose until it was full. Radiographs were taken to determine the extent of containment of the radiopaque liquid. The PTL airway successfully controlled the simulated upper airway hemorrhage in nine of the ten cases studied including one patient with a cleft palate. There was leakage in the tenth case due to a balloon leak. The PTL airway may be the prehospital airway of choice in trauma patients due to its ability to control upper airway hemorrhage, but it requires further clinical testing.\r"

Administration of tamoxifen (10 mg twice daily) to 30 Z homozygotes for a 30-day period was not associated with adverse reactions. However, although serum alpha 1AT levels increased significantly (p less than 0.03), the increase was minor (average pretreatment levels, 32 +/- 1 mg/dl; levels at 30 days of therapy, 35 +/- 1 mg/dl) and far below the \"threshold\" level of 80 mg/dl considered \"protective\" against an increased risk for emphysema. Thus, while the concept that increasing alpha 1AT synthesis and/or secretion is a rational goal for treating the Z homozygous form of alpha 1AT deficiency, tamoxifen will not be useful in this regard.\r"

Of 98 women participating in the trial, 60 had renal infections with susceptible strains, complied with drug therapy, and completed 6 weeks of follow-up. Before treatment, 39 women had symptoms and signs of acute pyelonephritis; 21 had symptoms of cystitis but positive tests for antibody-coated bacteria. All 60 women had alleviation of symptoms and resolution of bacteriuria after 7 days of therapy. Subsequent recurrences occurred in 12 of 27 women given ampicillin, compared with 4 of 33 given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (p = 0.008). Serotyping showed that most recurrences were reinfections with ampicillin-resistant strains. With each drug, a 2-week regimen of therapy proved as efficacious as a 6-week regimen, but the longer regimen was less well tolerated. We conclude that a 2-week treatment regimen is sufficient to manage acute pyelonephritis in outpatients and that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is preferable to ampicillin therapy.\r"

The stimulus consisted of 2.5- to 4.0-mA cathodal pulses, each of 1-ms duration, beginning at a frequency of 10 Hz and increasing by 10-Hz increments to 100 Hz. Unilateral stimulation from 10 to 30 Hz resulted in a graded vocal cord abduction, with the maximal glottic aperture occurring at 30 Hz. Stimulation above 30 Hz produced a graded cord adduction, with nearly complete glottic closure at 100 Hz; bilateral stimulation yielded similar results, with total glottic closure at 100 Hz. Confirmation of the RLN as mediator of this frequency-dependent cord motion was achieved by surgically isolating it and attaining identical results with direct stimulation. No cardiopulmonary alterations were observed in any trial. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the RLN seems to be a relatively safe, reliable, and noninvasive method of controlling vocal cord position and thereby the glottic airway in monkeys.\r"

The efficacy of acyclovir, vidarabine, bromovinyldeoxyuridine, and 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl) guanine in HSV-1-infected Vero cell monolayer cultures was compared with that seen with brain cell aggregates. At a mean 50% inhibitory dose with Vero cells, acyclovir showed a 99% reduction of virus titer in brain cell aggregates. Vidarabine and 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl) guanine gave a dose-dependent reduction in virus titer with Vero cells; however, in aggregate cultures treated with the same drugs a dose-dependent decrease at 24 h was followed by an increase to a point of no inhibition at 72 h postinfection. Pretreatment of brain cell aggregates with a hybrid human leukocyte interferon (Le IF-AD) reduced virus titers at 48 h postinfection but did not maintain this reduction at 72 h. In contrast, infected Vero cell monolayer cultures demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in virus titers with Le IF-AD. Postinfection treatment with Le IF-AD did not reduce plaque formation in Vero cells but was effective in reducing virus titer in HSV-1-infected brain cell aggregates at 48 h postinfection. Antiviral concentrations of up to 200 micrograms or 200,000 IU/ml for interferon did not appear morphologically toxic to brain cells. Antiviral therapy of HSV-1-infected brain cell aggregates may more closely mimic in vivo responses than monolayer cultures.\r"

Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for the individual compounds were determined from plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates. All clearances (total, renal, and nonrenal) and urinary recoveries of unchanged drug were found to be linearly related to creatinine clearance (CLCR). The steady-state volume of distribution (9.9 and 12.9 liters for ticarcillin and clavulanic acid) approximated the extracellular fluid space and was not related to CLCR. The half-lives increased with reduced renal function and ranged from 56 to 392 min for ticarcillin and 26 to 266 min for clavulanic acid. The clearances of both drugs decreased proportionately with reduction in renal function, facilitating dosing adjustments based on CLCR. Calculations of expected steady-state maximum and minimum concentrations in plasma using constant doses and an extended dosing interval related to CLCR further rationalized use of the 30:1 drug combination ratio for all patients.\r"

No correlation between octanoic and decanoic acid concentrations and control of seizures was established, but further studies with octanoic and decanoic acid using animal models are necessary to assess the role of these acids and of control of seizures.\r"

We investigated the use of lidocaine to prevent ventricular fibrillation during this period. In a blind, prospective, randomized trial, 91 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft procedures were given lidocaine (2 mg/kg) or normal saline immediately before removal of the aortic cross-clamp. The groups were similar with respect to demographic, clinical, and intraoperative variables. Myocardial preservation techniques were similar in both groups. Of 47 patients receiving lidocaine, 38 recovered a supraventricular rhythm without ventricular fibrillation, compared with only 5 of 44 patients in the control group (p less than .001). When ventricular fibrillation occurred, patients in the control group required a greater number of direct-current countershocks (2.31 versus 1.86) to convert to sinus rhythm. Transient heart block, requiring temporary pacing, developed in 3 patients in the lidocaine group, compared with 1 patient in the control group. There was no significant difference between the groups in the requirement for perioperative inotropic support (6 of 47 versus 6 of 44) or the number of myocardial infarctions (2 of 47 versus 1 of 44), and there were no deaths in either group. Lidocaine infusion immediately before removal of the aortic cross-clamp significantly reduces the incidence of ventricular fibrillation during the reperfusion period after cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

The dual-phase study compared incrementally increasing doses (50, 100, and 150 micrograms/kg) of diltiazem using a single-blind, randomized schedule with an equivalent volume of placebo added to each of three infusions of cold (10 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C) blood containing potassium chloride at 25 mEq/L for the initial infusion (400 ml) and at 12 mEq/L for the next two infusions (300 ml each). Observations included a number of operative variables, creatine kinase (CK)-MB curves, two-dimensional echocardiography, and pulsed Doppler sonography before operation and on postoperative days 1 and 5. Pulmonary artery thermistor catheter responses were observed for 16 hours postoperatively, as were left ventricular micromanometer-tipped catheter responses in 7 patients. As the dose of diltiazem was increased, there was increasing time to atrioventricular node refunction (23.6 to 62.0 minutes). Diltiazem at 100 micrograms/kg (D-100) resulted in a significantly lower peak CK-MB activity than its placebo. Peak - dp/dt increased in treated patients and decreased in patients given the placebo. The cardiac index in D-100 patients was greater on the first postoperative day than preoperatively. The stroke index returned to the control level by the fifth postoperative day in D-50 and D-100 patients only, and it remained depressed in placebo patients. Although few benefits were realized from the addition of diltiazem to cold blood potassium cardioplegia, there was dose-related prolongation of the atrioventricular node recovery time, which required cardiac pacing and thus was associated with its attendant risks.\r"

Patients with higher scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale had higher absolute metabolism and higher left relative to right hemispheric metabolism than did patients with lesser severity.

The steeper subcortical to cortical gradient in schizophrenics, present in the first study, persisted in the second. Changes in this gradient were uncorrelated with changes in clinical status. Laterality (right-left) was stable across studies, and changes toward higher right relative to left hemispheric metabolism were correlated with clinical improvement.

This study evaluated the influence of TENS on intraarticular (IA) temperature and pressure and synovial tissue of inflamed rabbit joints. Four hours after induction of acute bilateral hind joint arthritis by single intraarticular injection of urate crystals, the knees of 14 anesthetized rabbits were fixed at 90 degrees between femur and tibia. TENS was supplied from an electrical stimulator to the left knee joint while the other joint was unstimulated as a control. A microprobe needle for temperature measurement was inserted into the knee joint. Intraarticular pressure was recorded by polygraph connected to an IA needle. Readings were carried out at 10-min intervals three times before and four times after 5 min of TENS. A significant increase in IA temperature from mean 36.2C to 36.6C and significant reduction of IA pressure (mean decrease of 0.8 mmHg, from 2.5 mmHg to 1.7 mmHg) were found in the stimulated joints, which also showed a reduction of synovial fluid volume and total leukocyte count in comparison to the controls. While the nonstimulated synovial membrane showed massive leukocytic infiltration with neutrophilic exudate and fibrin clot in the intraarticular cavity, the stimulated synovial membrane demonstrated moderate homogeneous leukocytic infiltration through all layers, with absence of inflammatory exudate in the intraarticular cavity. These results suggested that the analgesic effect of TENS on arthritis may be partially attributed to decrease in IA synovial fluid pressure, volume, and leukocyte count. Therefore, TENS may be useful for reducing pain from inflammatory arthritis.\r"

The initial sepsis score was a strong determinant of survival: in survivors it was significantly lower than in nonsurvivors. Only 8% of patients with a sepsis score above 20 survived. At the onset of severe sepsis, the plasma levels of all four acute-phase proteins were significantly lower in nonsurvivors. A significant elevation of C3a levels in the plasma of both surviving and nonsurviving patients indicated marked consumption of complement components in all patients with severe sepsis. A linear equation was developed to predict survival: sepsis index of survival (SIS) % = 121 + 0.26 (complement factor B) + 0.36 (alpha-1-acid glycoprotein)-6 (sepsis score). Based on our analysis, at the onset of severe sepsis, an SIS of 50% or more can correctly predict 88% of survivors and an SIS less than 50% can correctly predict 86% of nonsurvivors several days in advance of clinical outcome.\r"

Ten mice subjected to a 25% scald were compared with ten anesthetized littermates (controls) and six untreated mice (normal mice) 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days after burn. Production of IL-2 by splenocytes was stimulated by concanavalin A alone, or in the presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or flurbiprofen. The IL-2 content of the resulting supernatant was determined by the response of the IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-2. The IL-2 production was significantly suppressed in the burned mice at three days (mean +/- SEM, 30.9% +/- 5.2%), five days (19% +/- 5.5%), seven days (41.6% +/- 6.4%), and 21 days (20% +/- 4.5%). Significant enhancement of IL-2 production by indomethacin was seen in the burned group (mean, 95%), but not in controls (mean, 23.8%) or normal mice (mean, 17.2%), and similar effects were seen with flurbiprofen. In separate experiments the effects of exogenous prostaglandin E2 on lymphocyte blastogenesis and IL-2 production were studied, and an increased susceptibility to the inhibitory effects of prostaglandin E2 was observed following thermal injury.\r"

  ".W": "The tendency of corticosteroids to exacerbate ocular infections limits their usefulness. Ketorolac tromethamine, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, is under development as an anti-inflammatory ophthalmic drug. In this study, rabbits ocularly infected with Candida albicans were treated topically four times daily with 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine or 0.1% dexamethasone for seven days after infection. Severity of infection was scored using both the Draize scale and Candida colony counts. Seven days after treatment ended, both the overall ocular scores (6/20) and colony count scores (0.5/3) were the same for ketorolac as for the vehicle, indicating no exacerbation of the infection, whereas with dexamethasone these values increased (13/20 and 2.3/3, respectively). During treatment, both ketorolac and dexamethasone reduced conjunctivitis equally (1.5/10) when compared with the vehicle (3.4/10). However, after treatment, conjunctivitis became more severe only in dexamethasone-treated eyes (6/10). Thus, unlike dexamethasone, ketorolac seems to be a drug that can suppress inflammation without exacerbating fungal ocular infection.\r"

  ".W": "An experimental therapeutic regimen for congenital lupus erythematosus, which consists of treating the mother with high doses of dexamethasone and performing plasmapheresis (3 times per week), was developed. This regimen was administered to a woman whose pregnancy was complicated by the abrupt onset of fetal pericarditis, myocarditis, and complete heart block in the twenty-fourth week of gestation. The effectiveness of plasmapheresis was evidenced by a decrease in the very high titer of SS-B (La) antibodies in the mother. After 5 weeks of therapy, the cardiac disease was ameliorated. The infant tolerated delivery at week 31, and the heart block has persisted. The rationale for this therapy for fetal disease is discussed, with emphasis on 2 goals: to diminish the quantity of maternal antibody that is transmitted to the fetus, and to suppress the manifestations of fetal carditis with the use of glucocorticoids that are not inactivated by the placenta. Tentative recommendations for more intensive prenatal monitoring of maternal and fetal status for those at risk are outlined.\r"

Alcohol misuse was directly or indirectly responsible for about 5-10% of hospital admissions in Sri Lanka. Prevalence of alcoholism in patients below 40 years (43% of cases) or with a strong family history (56% of cases) were demographic features simulating trends in developed nations. Although rarely an occupational hazard, the majority in this lower socio-economic group drank illicitly-manufactured brews with high alcohol content while many consumed a mixture of beverages. Lone drinkers were predominant (86%); features of psychological interest were sleep disturbance (64%), emotional problems (42%) and loneliness (34%); domestic problems (36%), social problems (24%) and financial problems (34%) were also noted. Many such factors, either singly or in combination, initiated or perpetuated the drinking habits of the patients. Drug misuse and suicidal tendencies were not observed. Severe hepatic damage was noted in 63% of 42 patients where the histology was demonstrated, and who usually presented with significant hepatomegaly; about 50% of patients below the age of 40 had hepatic damage of a serious or irreversible nature. Direct toxicity of ethanol, toxic contamination during the preparation of illicit brews and nutritional factors appear pertinent to hepatic damage in developing nations. Nutritional factors may cause variations in relation to abnormalities in liver function tests and also liver size among the population studied when compared to findings from the western world.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results showed that cefixime, administered in moderately low doses (8 mg/kg of body weight, two times per day), readily penetrated the chinchilla middle ear and rapidly sterilized the effusion. The data also suggest that the effusions were resolved more quickly in the cefixime-treated group compared with a group of animals treated with ampicillin or an untreated control group. No adverse side effects were noted in the cefixime-treated animals. The results of this study warrant the testing of cefixime for acute otitis media in the clinical setting.\r"

The lesions are strikingly similar to those detected in the infants of mothers with connective tissue diseases. In these infants the damage is associated with the transplacental passage of a maternal antibody to tissue ribonucleoproteins (anti-Ro). The same antibody was identified in 60% of 55 patients with polymyositis and in 69% (23/33) of those with associated cardiac damage including four with complete heart block. Forty five per cent of those patients who were anti-Ro seropositive had no clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac lesions. They were in the acute phase of illness, however, and no other more detailed heart investigations had been done. It is postulated that cardiac damage in polymyositis is caused by the antibody and that its presence may serve as a marker for heart involvement.\r"

In human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) there was depletion of intraepithelial lymphocytes, especially of T4+ subset, with reversal of the ratio of T4+ to T8+ subsets to less than one. In contrast, there was no significant reduction in the number of lymphocytes in the subepithelial stroma. Tac+ (antigen primed and clonal expanding) lymphocytes were absent both within the epithelium and in the subepithelial stroma. These findings support our suggestion that there is a localized immunodeficiency in HPV infection and CIN. The aetiological and therapeutic implications are discussed.\r"

Primiparity, induction of labour by amniotomy/oxytocin, forceps delivery, long first and second stages, oxytocin compared with syntometrine (oxytocin plus ergometrine maleate), as a prophylactic oxytocic, were identified as significant risk factors. Epidural analgesia contributed indirectly to an increase in the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. The changes in labour ward practice over the last 20 years have resulted in the re-emergence of PPH as a significant problem.\r"

  ".W": "In childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), abnormalities in the short (p) arm of chromosome 9, particularly those leading to the loss of material in the p21-p22 region, may be associated with bulky disease at diagnosis (so-called \"lymphomatous\" ALL) and a T cell immunophenotype. To assess these associations further, we reviewed the clinical and laboratory data for 100 consecutively evaluated children with ALL who had successful cytogenetic studies. From analysis of clinical and laboratory features, 8 of the 100 patients were classified as having lymphomatous ALL. Seven of the 100 patients had aberrations involving the 9p arm or were missing an entire chromosome 9. The prevalence rate of 9p abnormalities in cases of lymphomatous ALL was not significantly different from that in cases without lymphomatous features (1 of 8 v 6 of 92, P = .62). Moreover, all seven patients with 9p abnormalities had the common ALL phenotype. These data suggest that although 9p abnormalities in childhood ALL occur frequently, there is no consistent association with either the occurrence of lymphomatous clinical features or the presence of T cell disease.\r"

Because we previously demonstrated that the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) has antiproliferative properties and modulatory effects on cell differentiation, a protocol was designed for in vitro study and for clinical use in the patient. At diagnosis, blast cells were morphologically undifferentiated, had nondiagnostic cytochemistry, showed an abnormal karyotype (t[4;11]), expressed markers of B cell lineage, and demonstrated C mu gene rearrangement. Tissue culture of marrow or blood cells yielded colonies of leukemic blasts. Increasing concentrations of DFO produced a dose-dependent suppression of patient's blast colony growth in vitro, and blasts within colonies showed a marked change in surface antigen expression from lymphoid to myelomonocytic markers, became monocytic in appearance, and developed intense staining for nonspecific esterase. When DFO was given intravenously to the patient as a single agent for 48 hours, blasts no longer expressed lymphoid antigens and became strongly positive for myelomonocytic markers, identical to the in vitro findings. Intravenous DFO halted rising peripheral blood blast cell numbers and allowed a several-fold increase in normal hematopoietic progenitor colony growth. When combined with low-dose cytosine arabinoside in the treatment protocol, DFO caused striking leukemic cytoreduction. Our findings indicate that DFO has antileukemic properties by virtue of its effects on proliferation and differentiation, and they prompt further experimental and clinical studies with this agent.\r"

  ".W": "We reported previously that a cell line (TC-1) derived from adherent marrow cells produced colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and a separate activity that acts synergistically with CSF-1 to stimulate giant macrophage colonies. We now report that an activity in TC-1 conditioned media (CM) separate from CSF-1 also synergizes multilineage colony formation by pure interleukin 3 (IL 3) and a crude source of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA) (murine lung-conditioned media). IL 3-induced megakaryocyte colony formation is also synergized. The CSF-1-dependent synergistic activity is not blocked by antibodies to IL 3 and is characterized as a nondialyzable (mol wt cutoff 3,000), heat-stable (56 degrees C, 30') activity that binds to DE-52 cellulose under conditions in which IL 3 does not. This material has an apparent mol wt of approximately 200,000 by Sephadex G100 chromatography, and the bulk of it binds to Concanavalin A (Con A) and elutes off with alpha-methyl mannoside, indicating that it is a glycoprotein. As reported separately, these purified active fractions also have a pre-B cell-inducing activity. In addition, a non-IL 3 activity stimulates proliferation of the factor-dependent cell lines FDC-P1 and DA-1. These data indicate that an adherent marrow cell line produces a growth factor(s) that synergizes with IL 3, GM-CSA, and CSF-1 and induces pre-B cell formation. This may be an important regulator of early multilineage lymphohemopoiesis.\r"

Blood involvement was related to the type of cutaneous T-stage, being present in 90% of patients with erythroderma (T4), 27% of those with cutaneous tumors (T3), 9% of those with generalized (T2), and 0% of those with limited skin plaques (T1). Untreated patients with blood involvement (38 of 105) had a higher frequency of CTCL in lymph nodes and viscera and survival inferior to that of patients with normal or nondiagnostic lymphocyte morphology (P less than .001). Multivariate analysis showed skin stage and age to be the most important pretreatment risk factors for survival. Although blood involvement was not an independent risk factor for the entire group, it appeared to have some adverse influence in the T2/T3 subsets (P = .051). Both lymphocytosis and size distribution of the circulating CTCL cells at initial diagnosis influenced survival. Patients with \"mixed cell\" cytology (greater than 20% large [greater than 11 microns] CTCL cells), had a worse survival than those with predominantly small circulating CTCL cells (P = .009). The former were more likely to have aggressive features, including lymph node effacement by tumor (P less than .001) and visceral disease (P = .074), than were \"small cell\" patients. Our data indicate that detailed review of the blood lymphocyte morphology in patients with diagnosed or suspected CTCL is helpful in predicting extent of disease and prognosis.\r"

In the presence of fibrin, the amount of gamma-thrombin required for activation was not affected. Catalytically inactive i-Pr2P- and D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2-alpha-thrombin were found to inhibit over 95% of the activation by alpha-thrombin in the presence of fibrin. Unlike plasma factor XIII, the concentration of alpha-thrombin required for 50% activation of platelet factor XIII (a2 dimer) was lower, and the activation was not enhanced by fibrin. However, when the a2 platelet factor XIII was incubated with purified b-chains, the alpha- and gamma-thrombin concentrations required for activation increased tenfold and reached levels similar to those required for activation of the plasma factor XIII. When fibrin was present, the alpha-thrombin concentrations needed for activation of the a2b2 complexes were reduced, and the presence of fibrin had no effect on gamma-thrombin cleavage of the a2b2 complexes. Therefore, the b-chains must inhibit a-chain cleavage by alpha-thrombin in the absence of fibrin. These results imply that the formation of a cocomplex involving alpha-thrombin, fibrin, and plasma factor XIII causes some conformational change in plasma factor XIII such that the b-chains no longer inhibit cleavage of the a-chains.\r"

BFU-E from BM mononuclear cells (MNC) were cultured in methylcellulose medium and erythropoietin (Ep) +/- monocyte-conditioned medium (MoCM, a source of burst-promoting activity, BPA) in the presence or absence of autologous T cells (T) and/or monocytes (M phi) under either 5% or 21% O2 after depletion of T (MNC-T), M phi (nonadherent buoyant cells, NAB) or both T and M phi depletion (NAB-T). MNC BFU-E growth under 5% O2 was augmented over 0.1 to 1.5 U/mL of Ep. BFU-E augmentation under 5% O2 was abolished by depletion of BM M phi, T, or both from MNC. The addition of MoCM affected neither a BFU-E increase under 5% O2 nor the abrogation of that increase upon T or M phi depletion. The addition of 5% to 20% M phi or 10% to 20% T to NAB-T failed to restore the BFU-E increase under 5% O2. However, BFU-E augmentation under 5% O2 was reestablished when 10% autologous M phi, 10% T, or 10% T plus 10% M phi were added back to marrow NAB, MNC-T, or NAB-T. BM BFU-E was not augmented in the presence of varying concentrations of catalase, superoxide dismutase, or reduced glutathione at 21% O2; moreover, BFU-E augmentation was maintained at 5% O2 relative to 21% O2 in the presence of each of these antioxidants. CM prepared under 5% or 21% O2 from BM M phi, T, or M phi plus T were assessed for BPA against BM NAB-T using a sensitive BPA assay incorporating delayed Ep addition to cultures. Only CM from mixtures of M phi and T cells at 5% O2 demonstrated potent BPA; little or no BPA was detected with T or M phi CM at 5% O2 and at 21% O2 or T and M phi CM at 21% O2. The sensitivity of NAB-T BFU-E to exogenous BPA was virtually identical at 21% and 5% O2. These results indicate that human BM BFU-E are augmented under 5% O2 and that T cells and M phi together mediate that augmentation by collaborating to produce BPA-like activity in response to physiological O2 tensions.\r"

  ".W": "Many patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) have a platelet aggregating factor in their serum that may be pathologically linked with the disease process. To help characterize the type of platelet aggregation and platelet release induced by the sera from seven TTP patients, we measured the ability of a variety of inhibitors of platelet function as well as the ability of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against platelet glycoproteins to inhibit TTP sera-induced platelet aggregation and release. These results were compared with the ability of the same inhibitors to block platelet aggregation induced by ristocetin, collagen, ADP, thrombin, and IgG-immune complexes. Monoclonal antibody directed against platelet glycoprotein Ib totally inhibited ristocetin-induced aggregation and release but had no effect on aggregation and release induced by the TTP sera or by any of the other platelet agonists. However, the MoAb against glycoproteins IIb/IIIa inhibited aggregation and release caused by TTP sera as well as by collagen, thrombin, and ADP but had no effect on aggregation and release induced by ristocetin. The aggregating activity could be abolished by heparin but not by the serine protease inhibitor PMSF (1 mmol/L). And although monomeric human IgG and purified Fc fragments of IgG inhibited IgG-immune complex-induced aggregation and release, they had no effect on TTP sera-induced aggregation and release nor on aggregation and release induced by any of the other agonists. Consistent with these in vitro studies showing no effect of IgG were the in vivo observations that intravenous (IV) IgG was without effect when administered to three patients with TTP. This study indicates that although a von Willebrand factor (vWF)-rich preparation of cryoprecipitate enhances the in vitro platelet aggregation and release caused by sera from the seven TTP patients we studied, the pathway of aggregation and release is not via platelet glycoprotein Ib. Also the aggregating factor of TTP sera is not neutralized in vitro or in vivo by IgG.\r"

The clinical features of the two groups were compared. Mean disease duration was 11.7 years for the ACA-positive group and 1.1 years for the ACA-negative group. No ACA-positive patient had generalized skin SD, whereas all ACA-negative patients with disease duration greater than 6 months had moderate or severe proximal scleroderma. Only one ACA-positive patient had serious extra-oesophageal internal organ involvement, excluding primary biliary cirrhosis (three patients) which is itself associated with ACA. Three ACA-negative patients had serious extra-oesophageal internal organ involvement. No ACA-positive patient had been treated with penicillamine or captopril compared with 11 ACA-negative patients. Thus ACA appears to be a favourable prognostic indicator. Analysis of individual CREST manifestations in ACA-positive patients revealed that most had 'incomplete CREST', lacking one or two of the five features. The classification of SD patients as ACA-positive or ACA-negative is suggested.\r"

Rheumatoid arthritis was the predominant inflammatory joint disease, but was less severe. Ankylosing spondylitis is probably rare among the Saudis. Brucellosis was an important cause of acute back pain. Osteoarthritis was characterized by frequent involvement of the knee while the hip was rarely involved. Environmental factors may be responsible for this disease pattern. Regional pain syndromes, associated with obesity, bad posture, and poor physical fitness were also frequent problems.\r"

Its etiology and pathogenesis are uncertain, probably varied, and the distinction between inflammatory and malignant processes is difficult despite extensive clinical and histopathologic evaluation. The need for new techniques for rapid diagnosis has important therapeutic implications. Using an extensive panel of T- and B-cell monoclonal antibodies the authors describe a patient with clinically and pathologically typical LMG demonstrating an \"activated\" T-cell phenotype with a \"novel\" pattern characteristic of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, strongly implying that some cases of LMG are more closely related to neoplastic T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders than to inflammatory conditions. Further studies using these immunotyping techniques may help clarify the pathogenesis of LMG, and may uncover specific diagnostic and prognostic phenotypic patterns.\r"

The lymphoproliferative disorder was characterized by polyclonal, polymorphic B-cell content without evidence of cellular atypia, necrosis or prominent mitotic activity but with predominantly extranodal systemic and prominent pulmonary involvement. Since the lesion has overlapping features it is considered to be intermediate between benign and malignant lymphoproliferations and designated as polyclonal, polymorphic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (PBLD) of pediatric AIDS. The PBLD is part of a spectrum of lymphoid lesions in pediatric AIDS consisting of follicular lymphoid hyperplasia of nodal and extranodal sites, pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia/lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis complex (PLH/LIP complex) in cases previously reported by the authors, and also malignant lymphoma reported by others. It is possible that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by itself or in synergism with human T-lymphotropic virus-type III (HTLV-III) is related to pathogenesis of PBLD in children with AIDS.\r"

This study tested the hypothesis that 99mTc-PPi accurately sizes myocardial infarctions produced by temporary coronary artery occlusion and reflow in dogs. Three groups of dogs were studied: group A underwent 3 hr of occlusion followed by 2 hr of reperfusion, with 99mTc-PPi injected 10 min after reflow (n = 10); group B underwent 3 hr of occlusion followed by 2 hr of reperfusion, with 99mTc-PPi injected 90 min after reflow (n = 11); and group C underwent 3 hr of occlusion followed by reflow with 99mTc-PPi injected at 10 min and again at 48 hr after reflow (n = 5). Myocardial slices from group A and B dogs were imaged in vitro. Group C dogs were imaged with single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) in vivo, and myocardial slices were imaged in vitro at the conclusion of the study. The extent of myocardial infarction was defined with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, and coronary blood flow was estimated with radioactive microspheres. In addition, transmural myocardial tissue samples were taken from the center of the myocardial infarction, the lateral portion of the myocardial infarction, the normal myocardium adjacent to the lateral aspect of the infarcts, and from the normal myocardium and counted for 99mTc-PPi activity. A significant correlation was found between infarct size determined by areas of increased 99mTc-PPi uptake and that estimated from TTC staining for both group A (r = .89) and group B animals (r = .98).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The proportion of PBMC was examined by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibodies OKT and Leu series. NK activity in patients with nephrotics of minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) was significantly lower compared to those of the normal controls. In addition, ADCC activity in patients with nephrotics of MPGN was significantly lower compared to the normal controls. The sera from patients with diminished NK activity inhibited NK activity of PBMC from healthy individuals. Furthermore, OKM1 positive lymphocytes were significantly higher in the MCNS, MGN and MPGN patients and Leu7 positive lymphocytes were significantly higher in the MPGN patients. These data suggest that several mechanisms contribute to the defects of NK and ADCC activities in patients with PGD, and the defects in NK and killer cells are common in patients with nephrotics of MCNS, MGN and MPGN, and may be important in the pathogenesis of PGD.\r"

The proportion of autoradiographically visualized 3H-thymidine incorporating blasts at the S phase of the cell cycle was 1.2 +/- 0.3 percent. This phenomenon further confirms the impression that, in spite of activation, most of the pleural fluid mononuclear cells are resting cells. The T4/T8 ratio in the functionally active blast cell population determined by a double labeling method combining ABC staining with autoradiography was similar to the total T4/T8 ratio (2.3 +/- 0.7 vs 2.7 +/- 0.8, p greater than 0.05) calculated for all pleural fluid mononuclear cells.\r"

The functional activity of plasma alpha 1-protease inhibitor (in micrograms of enzyme inhibited per microgram of alpha 1-protease inhibitor) was slightly but significantly lower in smokers, compared with nonsmokers, both for TIC and EIC (smokers' TIC and EIC were 88.0 +/- 16.2 percent (+/- SD) and 90.4 +/- 17.9 percent of the respective mean values in nonsmokers; p less than 0.05). Among smokers, there was a significant negative correlation (r = -0.37; p less than 0.05) between the average number of cigarettes smoked per day and the functional activity of plasma alpha 1-protease inhibitor; the seven subjects who smoked 40 or more cigarettes per day had significantly lower EIC and TIC than the remaining smokers. In 12 smokers tested before and after a two-hour period of intense smoking of eight cigarettes, there was a statistically significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in EIC one hour after smoking to 93.9 +/- 2.5 percent (+/- SE) of the initial value prior to smoking. It is concluded that there is a slight but significant decrease in the functional activity of plasma alpha 1-protease inhibitor in smokers, both for TIC and EIC.\r"

We analyzed the registry data using multivariate discriminant analysis to identify and quantitate those factors that might predict operative mortality (OM) for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafts at Loyola University Medical Center: Operative mortality was defined as death within 30 days following surgery. A total of 50 clinical and angiographic variables were analyzed for possible univariate association with operative mortality. Twenty-two variables were found to have significant univariate association with OM, and these 22 variables were subjected to multivariate discriminant analysis. For patients undergoing isolated, elective coronary artery bypass, the factors found to be predictive of OM are age (greater than 70) (F = 11.57), severe (more than six stenoses) coronary artery disease (F = 5.81), diffuse disease (F = 5.54), positive family history (F = 5.17), and number of coronary arteries bypassed (F = 4.78).\r"

Hemorrhage was severe as indicated by a mean blood transfusion requirement of 9.4 units. Extravasation of contrast (46%), or an obvious vascular abnormality suggestive of a bleeding site (32%), was identified in 78% of patients. Extravasation was seen more frequently in patients with greater than or equal to 3 units of transfusion (66%) than in those with less than 3 units of transfusion (17%, P less than 0.001). After the introduction of pharmacologic techniques using heparin, tolazoline, streptokinase, and indwelling arterial catheters, the percentage of studies with extravasation of contrast increased from 32 to 65% (P less than 0.01). Application of aggressive angiographic techniques increases the diagnostic yield of angiography in acute severe lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage while exposing the patient to modest increased procedure-related risks which can be accepted in selected patients.\r"

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a protein produced by macrophages and is believed to be a primary mediator of host responses. IL-1 induces prostaglandin and fibrinogen synthesis and stimulates fibroblast proliferation. This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of IL-1 in the infertility associated with mild endometriosis. Peritoneal fluid (PF) was obtained at laparoscopy from 11 patients with minimal or mild endometriosis and from 7 women undergoing tubal ligation. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated and cultured for 24 hours. Peritoneal and macrophage culture fluids were studied for IL-1 activity, which was measured with the EL-4 assay. IL-1 activity was present in the PF of 10 of the 11 patients with endometriosis and 11 of the 11 macrophage culture fluids and was absent in the PF and macrophage culture fluid of the tubal ligation patients. The effect of recombinant alpha-IL-1 on the in vitro growth of 2-cell mouse embryos was also studied. IL-1 in concentrations similar to those present in the PF (greater than 1 U/ml) was toxic to mouse embryo development. We conclude that the IL-1 may play a role in the infertility associated with endometriosis.\r"

A marked decrease in CGRP-LI nerve fibers mainly around the ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus of both ileum and proximal colon was observed in diabetic rats. The sparsely located immunoreactive nerve cell bodies in the control rats were absent in the diabetic preparations. There were, however, intensely stained CGRP-LI varicose nerve fibers that ran through the internodal strands and over the myenteric ganglia of the diabetic intestines. These findings indicate the presence of CGRP-LI nerve fibers of dual origin in the intestinal wall. The absence of positive cell bodies and diminished CGRP-LI nerve fibers around the ganglion cells in the diabetic tissues suggest that the state of diabetes selectively affects CGRP-LI nerve fibers of intrinsic rather than extrinsic origin. Furthermore, the absence of change in substance P-like immunoreactivity in the enteric system of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes of the same duration suggests that calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P are contained in different populations of intrinsic nerve fibers in the gastrointestinal tract of the rat.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether 99mTc-iminodiacetic acid planar biliary scintigraphy combined with single photon emission computed tomography could detect sclerosing cholangitis and provide additional information regarding the extent and severity of disease. Thirteen patients with sclerosing cholangitis and 13 normal control subjects were studied. Scintigraphic results were also compared with previously reported studies of patients with isolated common bile duct obstruction and with primary biliary cirrhosis. The planar scintigraphy in patients with sclerosing cholangitis showed beading or bandlike constrictions of the biliary tract corresponding to lesions seen on cholangiography, and the image pattern was distinctly different from images obtained from patients with isolated common bile duct obstruction or primary biliary cirrhosis. The single photon emission computed tomography images of the liver in patients with sclerosing cholangitis demonstrated multiple focal areas of 99mTc-iminodiacetic acid retention, representing bile stasis in intrahepatic bile ducts. Compared to controls, the mean hepatic clearance half-time of 99mTc-iminodiacetic acid was markedly delayed in patients with sclerosing cholangitis (6-10 times normal). Individual patients with sclerosing cholangitis had wider variation in isotope clearance half-time from three regions of the liver than patients with isolated common bile duct obstruction, consistent with regional difference in disease severity and variable impairment of bile flow. In 4 patients with sclerosing cholangitis with incomplete filling of the right and left hepatic ducts at cholangiography, planar and single photon emission computed tomographic scintigraphy provided evidence of significant intrahepatic sclerosing cholangitis. In conclusion, combined 99mTc-iminodiacetic acid planar and single photon emission computed tomographic scintigraphy is a sensitive noninvasive test for the diagnosis of sclerosing cholangitis and reliably differentiates sclerosing cholangitis from isolated common bile duct obstruction or primary biliary cirrhosis. Measurement of isotope clearance half-time provides quantitative physiologic data that may be useful in the longitudinal follow-up of patients with sclerosing cholangitis.\r"

The lesions responsible for haemorrhage were colonic angiodysplasia (52 patients), small bowel vascular anomalies (16), Meckel's diverticula (nine), small bowel smooth muscle tumours (seven), gastric vascular anomalies (four), chronic pancreatitis (three), colonic diverticular disease (three) and 16 other miscellaneous lesions. No lesion was found in 21 cases. Lesions were first shown by visceral angiography (69 patients), at laparotomy (23), on endoscopy (11), on gastrointestinal contrast radiological studies (four), and at ERCP (three). Lesions which were undetectable at operation increased markedly with age (p less than 0.0001). Expert visceral angiography is strongly recommended before surgery in patients over 45 years of age and after laparotomy when no cause has been found. Exploratory laparotomy is recommended at an early stage for younger patients, and for older patients after non-diagnostic angiography.\r"

  ".W": "Using a genetically defined rat model for the heterotopic transplantation of a vascularized knee in the rat, histological and histochemical studies of acute rejection in vascularized allografts of bone were carried out. The graft consisted of the knee joint with the distal end of the femur, the proximal part of the tibia, the cartilaginous growth plates, the articular cartilage, and a minimum cuff of muscle, which was transferred to a location under the abdominal skin. A total of 160 transplants, including vascularized and non-vascularized isografts, vascularized and non-vascularized allografts that were transplanted across a strong histocompatibility barrier, and vascularized allografts of bone that were transplanted across a weak histocompatibility barrier, were studied by light microscopy at intervals for as long as twelve weeks after transplantation. Vascularized allografts of bone that were transplanted across a strong histocompatibility barrier showed evidence of rapid rejection, similar to that after transplantation of allografts of visceral organs. This was manifested at one week by necrosis of osteocytes, cessation of microcirculatory flow, massive extravasation of red cells, and deposition of fibrin in the marrow. The large vessels demonstrated changes that were characteristic of vascular rejection. Allografts that were transplanted across a weak histocompatibility barrier showed a more gradual, less intense process of rejection that allowed observation of the evolution of the process. In these grafts, the osteoblasts and marrow in the primary spongiosa of the metaphysis were early targets of rejection, as indicated by necrosis of osteoblasts, extravasation of red blood cells, and deposition of fibrin in the marrow spaces. Loss of osteoblasts from the surfaces of osteoid as well as from bone on spicules of calcified cartilage resulted in the cessation of new-bone formation. Calcification of the longitudinal septa between the lowermost hypertrophic chondrocytes was decreased. However, the proliferation and maturation of chondrocytes in the zone of proliferating chondrocytes and in the upper hypertrophic zone continued and resulted in the formation of a thickened growth plate. The loss of osteocytes in other areas of the graft occurred later and only in the areas where the microcirculation had been lost. These data suggest that ischemic damage, which is probably secondary to an immune-related vascular compromise, is a significant factor in the failure of grafts. In the grafts that were transplanted across a weak histocompatibility barrier, the growth of new bone and revascularization by the host occurred by twelve weeks.\r"

Among 32 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, anti-DNA antibody was positive in 7. None of the patients with simple goiter had positive or weakly positive anti-DNA antibody results. Although the quantity of antibodies did not correlate well in individual patients, the rates of positive TSH binding-inhibiting immunoglobulin and anti-DNA antibody tests were roughly comparable in these patient groups. None of these patients with thyroid disease associated with anti-DNA antibody had clinical or other serological evidence suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus or related collagen vascular disorders. The finding of anti-DNA antibody provides a new aspect of immunological abnormality associated with hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease.\r"

Scatchard analysis of the binding of [3H]CVZ to cytosol from ICR 27 cells was consistent with a single class of receptors of uniform affinity (0.7 nM). Cytosolic [3H]CVZ complexes had a sedimentation coefficient of 4.6S on linear sucrose gradients and eluted from DEAE-cellulose columns at a potassium phosphate concentration of 250 mM. CVZ also competed with [3H]DEX mesylate for binding to a 96,000 mol wt protein. Incubation of ICR 27 cells with CVZ caused 50% growth inhibition and 50% maximal induction of glutamine synthetase activity at concentrations of 20 and 35 nM, respectively. Elution profiles of [3H]CVZ complexes from DEAE-cellulose columns showed that complexes formed upon thermal activation were relatively unstable, and little or no increase in binding of [3H]CVZ-receptor complexes to DNA-cellulose was observed. Thus, [3H]CVZ identifies functional glucocorticoid receptors in a cell line previously described as DEX resistant. Although the binding of [3H]CVZ to activated receptors in vitro appears unstable, high concentrations of CVZ may facilitate stabilization of activated complexes that can mediate both anabolic and catabolic effects.\r"

  ".U": "87138152\r", 
  ".W": "Adrenal steroidogenesis is dependent upon cholesterol derived from both de novo biosynthesis and uptake of plasma lipoproteins through the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients homozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia have a mild impairment in cortisol secretion during maximal ACTH stimulation. Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, has been used clinically to inhibit de novo cholesterol synthesis in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. In this study we examined hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function in seven patients with defects in the LDL receptor pathway, both before and during treatment with oral mevinolin (20 mg, twice a day), to assess whether inhibition of cholesterol synthesis influences steroidogenesis under basal conditions and in response to ovine CRH and exogenous ACTH. Two months after initiation of therapy, high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly elevated, and LDL cholesterol levels were reduced, although not normalized. Basal and ovine CRH-stimulated adrenocortical function were normal in all patients both before and during therapy. Plateau plasma cortisol concentrations achieved during maximal ACTH stimulation were lower than those in control subjects in all patients both before and during therapy. All patients, however, had an approximately 3-fold increase over basal values. These results suggest that treatment of patients with defects in the LDL receptor pathway with mevinolin improves the plasma lipid profile and does not result in adrenal dysfunction or further exacerbation of the mild impairment of adrenal function during maximal ACTH stimulation.\r"

  ".U": "87138162\r", 
  ".W": "The augmentation of GH secretion that occurs during puberty has been attributed to changes in sex steroid levels that enhance the frequency and amplitude of GH pulses. To investigate the specific GH pulse characteristics responsible for such augmentation we analyzed the serum GH concentration profiles of 10 boys in Tanner stages I-II of sexual development (group A; aged 10 5/12-15 1/12 yr) and compared their GH pulse characteristics with those of 5 boys at Tanner stages IV-V of development (group B; aged 14 8/12-15 1/12 yr). We also reanalyzed previously reported data from 5 prepubertal boys (group C; aged 13 6/12-15 5/12 yr) before and after 10 weeks of treatment with testosterone enanthate (100 mg/4 weeks, im). Using a pulse detection algorithm that constrains the false positive pulse detection rate to less than 5% (Cluster), we found that group B boys had a significantly higher mean serum GH pulse amplitude compared to group A boys (17.1 +/- 2.6 vs. 8.6 +/- 1.7 ng/mL; P = 0.012), but both groups had the same mean GH pulse frequency (group B, 5.4 +/- 0.5 pulses/24 h vs. group A, 5.5 +/- 0.4 pulses/24 h; P greater than 0.05). Similar changes were found in group C boys before and after testosterone therapy; there was no significant change in GH pulse frequency (6.6 +/- 0.9 before vs. 7.6 +/- 0.5 pulses/24 h after treatment; P greater than 0.05), but there was a significant increase in the GH pulse amplitude after therapy (6.8 +/- 1.6 before vs. 15.4 +/- 2.4 ng/mL after treatment; P = 0.04). When the 24-h GH concentration profiles were analyzed using a mathematically distinct method for the estimation of pulse amplitudes, namely the Fourier expansion time series, we confirmed a significant increase in GH pulse amplitude with later stages of puberty and androgen treatment. We conclude that the augmentation in GH secretion that occurs during either spontaneous puberty or exogenous testosterone therapy is an amplitude-modulated phenomenon, relatively independent of changes in pulse frequency. Such an effect may be secondary to the action of sex steroid hormones modulating either the responsivity of somatotrophs to endogenous GH-releasing hormone, the amount of GH-releasing hormone secreted, or the tonic inhibitory tone of somatostatin.\r"

The patients were studied for the presence of an adrenal steroidogenic defect by ACTH stimulation testing (Cortrosyn, 0.25 mg iv bolus dose). Based on published nomogram standards for serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), seven patients (30%) were diagnosed as having the nonclassical symptomatic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency [mean post ACTH 4244 +/- 1113 (SD) ng/dl]. Three patients (13%) were diagnosed to have a mild form of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency based upon the response of serum delta 5-17-hydroxypregnenolone (delta 5-17P) and dehydroepiandrosterone, and the ratio of delta 5-17P/17-OHP to ACTH stimulation (delta 5-17P: 1543 +/- 272 ng/dl vs. Tanner stage I control subjects, 350 +/- 197 ng/dl; dehydroepiandrosterone: 675 +/- 190 ng/dl vs. Tanner stage I control subjects, 82 +/- 79 ng/dl; delta 5-17P/17-OHP: 8.1 +/- 2.6 vs. Tanner stage I control subjects, 1.4 +/- 0.6). No enzyme defect could be identified in the remaining 13 patients (57%). Eleven patients with premature pubarche, with and without an adrenal enzymatic defect, underwent dexamethasone suppression. In all patients the measured steroid levels were suppressed. Thus, the dexamethasone suppression test alone did not distinguish the pathogenesis of premature pubarche. In conclusion, premature pubarche is more commonly due to a partial enzyme defect in adrenal steroidogenesis than has been previously recognized.\r"

Many of the perimenopausal nonosteoporotic women had increased serum osteocalcin values, but 15 yr or more after the menopause most of the women had serum osteocalcin levels in the normal range. Comparing normal women before and after menopause, the mean serum osteocalcin levels [7.8 +/- 4.7 (+/- SE) and 10.1 +/- 9.4 ng/mL] were not significantly different; however, the TBCa values (898 +/- 99 and 806 +/- 111 g) were significantly different (P less than 0.001). When the normal postmenopausal women were regrouped according to high vs. low osteocalcin values, TBCa and phosphorus content as well as forearm linear bone density were significantly lower in the high osteocalcin group, even though most of the other variables, including urinary hydroxyproline excretion, serum alkaline phosphatase, age, height, and weight, were not different. Osteoporotic women had a mean serum osteocalcin concentration of 17.4 +/- 8.6 ng/ml and a TBCa of 657 +/- 83 g, both significantly different from the respective values in normal and pre- and postmenopausal women (P less than 0.001 for both variables in comparison to each group). These data suggest that high serum osteocalcin levels, at least on a group basis, are an index of low skeletal mass.\r"

In patients with primary aldosteronism (n = 21) elevated as well as normal values of urinary 21-deoxyaldosterone were found, indicating that in some patients aldosterone may be formed not only from corticosterone but also from the 21-deoxy compound. In patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (n = 21) urinary 21-deoxyaldosterone was invariably elevated, whether the patients had the virilizing or salt-losing form of the disease. Although the clinical manifestations of the salt-losing form seem unrelated to the inability to convert 21-deoxyaldosterone to aldosterone, the determination of 21-deoxyaldosterone adds insight into the biosynthesis of aldosterone in primary aldosteronism and 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\r"

Until recently, expression of the CALC-II gene had been detected only in a metastasis of medullary thyroid carcinoma. In this study, expression of the CALC-II gene was demonstrated by Northern blot hybridization analysis in four of six cell lines established from different Ewing sarcomas, a malignant neoplasm of bone. Expression of the CALC-I gene was not detected in any of the six cell lines. A presumed large mol wt immunoreactive precursor of CGRP-II and small amounts of mature CGRP-II, but no CT, were found in medium from IARC/EW 1 cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned cDNA from this cell line confirmed the production of CGRP-II mRNA. CALC-II gene expression in Ewing sarcoma might be useful for studies concerning regulation of gene expression in the CALC gene family and possibly for tumor classification.\r"

Fifty-seven clones were successfully expanded and tested for reactivity, cytotoxicity, helper/suppressor function, and phenotype. In the reactivity assays clones were tested for responses to autologous and allogeneic PMC, thyroid cells, human thyroglobulin (hTg), and microsomal antigen. Two distinct patterns of functional T cell clones emerged from these characterization studies. Seventy-five percent of T cell clones recovered from Graves' disease thyroid tissue (n = 21) were of helper-induced (CD4+/4B4+) phenotype, and most were effective immunoglobulin helper clones. Fifty percent of Graves' T cell clones responded to autologous PMC, and 33% had a proliferative response to autologous thyroid cells. No cytotoxic clones were derived from Graves' thyroid tissue. By contrast, intrathyroidal T cell clones from patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (n = 36) were 59% suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8+) phenotype, 17% suppressed immunoglobulin secretion, and 55% were cytotoxic to allogeneic blast cells. Fifty-five percent of clones also responded to autologous PMC, and one clone was nonspecifically autocytotoxic. In the thyroid antigen proliferation assays 11% of thyroiditis clones reacted to human thyroglobulin, but none responded to microsomal antigen. Two clones were cytotoxic to autologous but not allogeneic thyroid cells. These data demonstrate that the majority of intrathyroidal T cells in autoimmune thyroid disease are autoreactive. However, small numbers of thyroid-specific T cell clones are present within the thyroid of such patients; they are principally helper-inducer T cells in Graves' disease thyroid and cytotoxic T cells in autoimmune thyroiditis.\r"

Two other inhibitor patients, the brothers, were shown to have a presumably identical complex rearrangement of the factor IX gene involving two separate deletions. The first deletion is of approximately 5.0 kb and removes exon e. The second deletion is between 9 and 29 kb and removes exons g and h but leaves exon f intact. An abnormal Taq I fragment at one end of the deletion junctions acted as a marker for the inheritance of hemophilia B in the patients' family. Five other inhibitor patients have a structurally intact factor IX gene as detected by this method. Our studies indicate that whereas large structural factor IX gene defects predispose hemophilia B patients to developing an anti-factor IX inhibitor, the development of an inhibitor can be associated with other defects of the factor IX gene.\r"

  ".W": "Immunosuppressive effects of E-series prostaglandins have been demonstrated in many in vitro assays of immune responsiveness as well as in autoimmune diseases. To explore the mechanisms underlying prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-associated immunosuppression in autoimmunity, we treated SJL mice immunized to produce immune-mediated interstitial nephritis with PGE1, PGF2 alpha, or vehicle alone. Mice receiving PGE1 treatment do not develop interstitial nephritis, nor do they display delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to the immunizing renal tubular antigen preparation. The observed immunosuppression is critically dependent on PGE1 administration during the period of effector T cell induction. We therefore investigated the effect of PGE1 on the in vitro induction of DTH effector T cells reactive to renal tubular antigens (SRTA). PGE1 inhibits effector T cell induction in a dose-dependent, reversible manner, but has no inhibitory effect on fully differentiated DTH effector cells or SRTA-reactive cell lines. The PGE1 effect is indirect and mediated via nonspecific suppressor lymphokines. This suppression can be overcome by recombinant interleukin 1 (IL-1), which suggests a mechanism related to either diminished IL-1 secretion or target cell sensitivity to IL-1.\r"

In order to assess a possible role for EGF in the pituitary hyperfunction characteristic of the in utero fetus, we measured changes in plasma immunoreactive ACTH concentrations after acute administration of saline, purified mouse EGF or synthetic ovine corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) to chronically catheterized fetal sheep. Both CRF and EGF were associated with increases in plasma immunoreactive ACTH concentrations. Peak values 60 min after 10-micrograms injections of either EGF or CRF increased from baseline ACTH values of 61 +/- 11 pg/ml to 191 +/- 37 and 178 +/- 25 pg/ml, respectively. Dose-response studies indicate that at low doses (less than 20 micrograms) EGF is as potent a stimulus for ACTH release as CRF. EGF infusion was not associated with detectable changes in circulating CRF, catecholamines, arginine vasopressin levels, or plasma growth hormone concentrations. We speculate that EGF may be important in the regulation of pituitary function in the developing mammalian fetus.\r"

  ".W": "The response to skin testing with tuberculins extracted from various species of mycobacteria was studied in 49 patients from Dundee with chronic obstructive airways disease. Seventeen had never been treated with steroids (group 1), 17 were receiving short term high doses of prednisolone (group 2) and did not have impaired Synacthen tests; 15 were receiving long term maintenance treatment and did have impaired Synacthen tests (group 3). Erythematous and indurated reactions were seen in a few patients, more commonly to antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis than to the other species: neither of the latter treatment groups showed appreciable reduction in reactivity compared with that of the group 1 patients. The number and microanatomical distribution of the T4 and T8 lymphocytes and the M3 bearing monocytes and macrophages was studied immunocytochemically in cryostat sections of biopsy specimens from the antigen injection sites. The density of these cells was significantly less in clinically negative reactions than in those with erythema or induration, but was unrelated to the presence or absence of a history of treatment with prednisolone. The T4:T8 ratio in the section as a whole was similar to that of the peripheral blood, but T8 cells were relatively more common in the perivascular and periappendicular foci, and T4 lymphocytes were predominant in the diffuse component of the infiltrate. I12 receptor bearing lymphocytes were uncommon: such cells were least common in the clinically negative reactions, but the number and distribution were apparently unrelated to the presence or absence of prednisolone treatment. It was concluded that currently accepted regimens of treatment with prednisolone did not reduce the effector arm of type IV (delayed type hypersensitivity) responses and so are unlikely to compromise this aspect of protective immunity.\r"

The reference range was derived from measurements in 20 controls without gastrointestinal disease. Alpha-1-antitrypsin excretion was increased in patients with excessive 51Cr-albumin loss, and correlations were found between alpha-1-antitrypsin clearance and 51Cr-albumin excretion. Because of the considerable overlap of faecal alpha-1-antitrypsin excretion between controls and patients, sensitivity and specificity of the test were only 58% and 80%, respectively. This poor reliability could not be explained by sampling error or temporal variations in alpha-1-antitrypsin excretion. These results show that although faecal alpha-1-antitrypsin excretion correlates with 51Cr-albumin excretion when whole groups of patients are studied, its poor sensitivity makes it an unreliable measure of enteric protein loss.\r"

The operators of the assays were unaware of the clinical diagnoses. In the group with rheumatoid arthritis 75.4% were positive by latex fixation, 73.9% by haemagglutination, and 55.1% by nephelometry. In the group with non-rheumatoid arthropathies 10.4% were positive by latex fixation, 8.6% by haemagglutination, and 10.4% by nephelometry. Thus the simple and inexpensive latex fixation test was as good as the haemagglutination test, and both were significantly better than nephelometry in the laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of definite or classic rheumatoid arthritis (chi 2 = 5.40 and 4.56, and p less than 0.025 and less than 0.05, respectively). None of these tests was significantly better or worse than the others in producing positive results in the group with non-rheumatoid arthropathies.\r"

In order to determine if these disorders are also similar immunologically, we studied the immunopathology of five biopsy specimens from three cases of pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta and three biopsy specimens from three cases of pityriasis lichenoides chronica. We then compared them to our prior immunohistologic study of nine cases of lymphomatoid papulosis. Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta and pityriasis lichenoides chronica both exhibited a dermal and epidermal infiltrate of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing activation antigens. These were admixed with numerous macrophages. The lesional epidermis was diffusely human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+ and contained decreased CD1+ dendritic cells. Endothelial cells were also HLA-DR+. Cells bearing the phenotypes of B cells, follicular dendritic cells, or natural killer/killer cells were essentially absent. Except for the lack of large atypical cells, the results resembled those described previously for lymphomatoid papulosis. These findings indicate that pityriasis lichenoides chronica, pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta, and lymphomatoid papulosis share several immunohistologic features. Together with certain clinicopathologic similarities, they are consistent with the hypothesis that these three disorders are interrelated.\r"

Two hundred sixty-nine of these received therapy for greater than 3 months and had at least two antinuclear antibody (ANA) determinations. We have found that the difference between the number of significantly positive ANAs pre-PUVA therapy (4 of 269) compared to post-PUVA therapy (16 of 269) was not statistically significant. Furthermore, of the patients who did develop a significantly positive ANA, not one was found to have any symptoms, signs, or laboratory evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. We therefore suggest obtaining ANAs prior to initiating PUVA therapy and obtaining follow-up ANAs only if the initial ANA is significantly positive. Patients with pre-PUVA--positive ANAs can be started on PUVA therapy if there is no evidence of lupus erythematosus.\r"

We questioned if the remaining elements of the mononuclear cell (MNC) population also played a part in the immunologic abnormalities noted. We therefore evaluated the ability of MNC populations from homosexuals with AIDS and AIDS-associated conditions to suppress the mitogenic responses of control MNCs in an assay of \"spontaneous suppressor\" cell activity (SSCA). Asymptomatic homosexuals and homosexuals with chronic lymphadenopathy, Kaposi's sarcoma, or opportunistic infections (OIs) had levels of SSCA equal to or greater than that of control subjects. Levels were significantly higher in patients with lymphadenopathy (p less than or equal to 0.1) and in patients with OI (p less than or equal to 0.05). Although percentages of Ia+ cells were increased in all homosexual groups and highest in patients with OIs (p less than or equal to 0.05), percentages of either monocytes or suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, potential mediators of SSCA function, did not correlate with levels of SSCA observed. Therefore, patients with AIDS and AIDS-associated conditions have MNC populations that appear to interact in producing normal or augmented down regulation of residual T-lymphocyte function, even in the face of helper/inducer T-lymphocyte depletion.\r"

Antigen-specific Ts were induced in CBA mice by i.v. priming with 3 X 10(7) syngeneic spleen cells (SC) that were chemically coupled with the hapten azobenzenearsonate (ABA). Transfer of splenic T cells from these mice by i.v. injection suppressed the induction in syngeneic assay hosts of ABA-reactive helper and cytotoxic T cell (Tc) responses. Although the Th responses and their suppression were ABA specific, in that they were not induced or activated by trinitrophenyl (TNP)-coupled SC, both Tc responses and their suppression were occasionally nonspecific. Induction of Th was assayed by measuring the release from primed lymph node cells of IL 2 and IL 3 in response to haptenated SC in vitro. Both cytotoxic and Th responses could be made dependent on the provision of exogenous Th by reducing the antigen dose. This stratagem allowed the assay in vivo of a long-term cultured ABA-specific Th cell line (E9). Injection of 10(5) E9 cells/mouse (with antigen, in the rear footpad) helped the induction of both Tc and Th in response to a reduced dose of antigen. These responses, which were dependent on the E9 cell line, were also suppressed by i.v. transferred Ts. When normal doses of antigen were used, the injection of 10(5) E9 Th overcame suppression. These results show that Ts act by inhibiting the activation of Th, thereby suppressing Th-dependent responses generally. The fact that the E9 Th cell line could be suppressed also shows that long-term culture of T cells does not affect their capacity to be regulated in vivo.\r"

In this study we examined PL metabolism in highly purified trinitrophenyl (TNP)-binding B cells after their activation with various forms of TNP-carrier protein. Such cells show similar changes in PL metabolism when stimulated with either antigen or anti-Ig, i.e., increased incorporation of 32PO4 into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl inositol (PI) but not phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, or phosphatidyl serine. We have demonstrated that these responses to antigen are TNP-specific and dose-related between 1 and 50 micrograms/ml, producing up to a 2.5-fold stimulation of 32PO4 incorporation into PI. The PL response is also directly related to the density of TNP on the carrier and can be augmented by additional cross-linking of the carrier protein. These data suggest that cross-linking of surface Ig by antigen induces a change in PL metabolism as an early event in B cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from healthy donors immune to the soluble antigens tetanus toxoid (TT) and/or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) were exposed to infectious human T lymphotropic virus, type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV) with and without prior activation by TT or KLH. After exposure to the virus, PBMNC that had been activated by antigen were 10 to 100 times more susceptible to viral replication, as estimated by measurement of production of reverse transcriptase and viral antigens, than PBMNC that had been preincubated without antigen. In addition, exposure of PBMNC to HTLV-III/LAV led to a loss of lymphocyte blastogenic responses after 2 to 3 wk in culture. HTLV-III/LAV-induced inhibition of lymphocyte blastogenic responses occurred in the absence of detectable production of RT but required the use of live rather than heat-inactivated virus. These results demonstrate that HTLV-III/LAV infection is amplified by antigen-induced activation of PBMNC, and that low levels of HTLV-III/LAV infection in vitro can suppress lymphocyte blastogenic responses. This study provides an in vitro model for the analysis of HTLV-III/LAV-induced immune defects.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, when exposed to soluble products of peripheral blood monocytes, elaborate granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA) and erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA). We have performed studies to determine if the monokine IL 1 can stimulate endothelial cells to release hematopoietic growth factors and whether such factors can also support human megakaryocyte (Meg) and mixed-cell colony growth. Various concentrations of recombinant human IL 1 beta (rIL 1) and media conditioned by monocytes (MCM), endothelial cells (ECM), and endothelial cells cultured for 3 days in 50% MCM (ECMM) or rIL 1 (ECMrIL 1) were added to marrow mononuclear cells cultured in methylcellulose. ECMM and ECMrIL 1 stimulated, in a dose-dependent fashion, the growth of Meg, mixed-cell, and GM colonies and erythroid bursts. In contrast, ECM, MCM, and rIL 1 displayed little or no activity in the colony-forming assays. Preincubation with specific antisera to native human IL 1 or rIL 1 reduced by 75 to 100% the activity of MCM in stimulating endothelial cell release of BPA, GM-CSA, Meg-CSA, and mixed-cell CSA. Meg-CSA, although readily detectable at ECMM and ECMrIL 1 concentrations in culture of 1 to 5%, was partially masked by lineage-specific inhibitors of Meg colony growth. When ECMM was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography, the megakaryocytopoietic inhibitory activity eluted in the high Mr fractions (greater than 75 kD). Meg-CSA co-eluted with GM-CSA and BPA in a single peak of 30 kD. We conclude that endothelial cells, in response to IL 1, produce one or more growth factors that probably act on multiple classes of progenitor cells.\r"

  ".W": "When cultured with native or recombinant interleukin 2 (IL 2), human lymphoid cells proliferate and acquire the ability to lyse both NK-sensitive and NK-resistant tumor targets. Such IL 2-activated killer (IAK) cells generally do not destroy nonmalignant nontransformed cells. Due to their apparent specificity for tumor cells, adoptive immunotherapeutic trials of IAK cells and IL 2 have been initiated, with promising results. However, infusion of high doses of IL 2 causes systemic toxicity in patients and experimental animals resulting in the development of a vascular leakage syndrome. Certain aspects of such toxicity suggest IL 2-induced, cell-mediated destruction of normal tissue. This study examines the interaction between IL 2-induced human lymphoid cells and endothelial cells (EC). IL 2, in a dose-dependent manner, causes lymphocytes to strongly adhere to EC, but not to tumor cells, fibroblasts, or epithelial cells. In addition, these IL 2-activated lymphocytes were highly cytotoxic not only to NK-resistant Daudi cells but also to vascular and corneal EC. The IAK cells caused lysis of not only human EC but also bovine EC. Although IAK cells did not display significant adherence to normal human fibroblasts or epithelial cells, when brought together by 50 X G centrifugation, these targets were lysed by IAK cells. The ability to lyse EC was not confined to any single subpopulation of IL 2-activated lymphocytes. The lysis of EC was mediated by both IL 2-activated large granular lymphocytes and small agranular lymphocytes. Furthermore, cells within both CD4+ and CD8+ sublineages of T cells, and also non-T subpopulations, mediated IL 2-induced cytolysis of EC. The destruction of EC by IAK cells may contribute in part to the systemic toxicity associated with infusions of high doses of IL 2.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate the possible contribution of other cytokines to the lytic activity of NKCF-containing supernatants. We compared some of the functional properties of human NKCF and purified recombinant human rLT and rTNF. It was found that the target cell specificity of rLT was quite different from NKCF in that rLT was neither species specific nor NK specific. Furthermore, antibodies against rLT did not affect the lytic activity of NKCF. These results demonstrate that LT does not significantly contribute to the lytic activity mediated by NKCF. The target specificity of rTNF was found to be related to that of NKCF with the exception of one NK-resistant cell line that was lysed by rTNF in a 20-hr 51Cr-release assay. However, rTNF was not toxic to any of the target cells tested as assessed by trypan blue exclusion in a 20-hr assay unless the targets were labeled with 51Cr. In contrast, NKCF did kill target cells as detected by trypan blue exclusion that were not labeled with 51Cr. Further analysis of this mechanistic difference in the lytic activity of rTNF and NKCF revealed that rTNF in combination with either cycloheximide or mitomycin C but not IFN-gamma could lyse unlabeled U937 target cells. In addition, pretreatment of U937 target cells with nonradioactive Na2CrO4 at concentrations equivalent to that used to 51Cr-labeled cells resulted in their susceptibility to lysis by rTNF as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. These findings suggest that lysis of several susceptible target cells in 20 hr by rTNF requires the presence of additional agents that may be sublethally toxic and/or inhibitory to macromolecular synthesis. Antibody inhibition studies revealed that anti-TNF mediated from partial to complete inhibition of lysis of U937 by unfractionated supernatants containing NKCF. However, fractionation of such supernatants on chromatofocusing columns yielded two distinct peaks of activity eluting in the pH range of 5 to 6 and 7 to 8. Anti-TNF could inhibit the acidic form of NKCF but not the neutral form. It is concluded that NKCF activity is mediated in part by TNF or an antigenically related molecule as well as some other distinct factor(s). The lack of consistent inhibition of NK CMC by anti-TNF suggests that TNF alone is not sufficient to mediate NK activity, or else it is inaccessible to the added antibody.\r"

Because in different DRw13 haplotypes one DRw13 beta-chain can be associated with other distinct DRw13 beta-chains, such complex associations allowed us to determine the ability of a given DR beta-chain to present the antigen or COT C2. The presence of the DR beta-chain 6B5, and only this chain, is associated with the ability to induce the proliferation of clone COT C2 whatever the second DR beta-chain associated with 6B5 is, namely 6B4 or 6B3. The DRw13 cells that express 6B4 or 6B3 but not 6B5 could not present the antigen to COT C2. Moreover, ILR2, a monoclonal antibody that precipitated 6B5, blocked the proliferation of COT C2, whereas 7.3.19.1, a monoclonal antibody that precipitated only 6B4 and 6B3, could not block the proliferation of this clone. Thus, the DRw13 beta-chain 6B5 appears as the unique class II element that restricts the response of the T cell clone COT C2.\r"

  ".W": "The B10.A T cell proliferative response to pigeon cytochrome c is largely directed to a single site in the molecule located at the carboxyl terminus within the amino acid sequence of residues 81 to 104. This study uses the pigeon cytochrome c-specific T cell clone A.E7 and synthetic peptide analogs to clarify the role of certain residues within this sequence in T cell recognition. By using the helically constrained amino acid, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, alternated with alanine in an amino-terminal leader sequence, we generated a series of molecules of similar length and alpha-helical conformation but which contain increasing lengths of the native sequence. By comparing the stimulatory ability of this series of peptides, we have clearly identified that the isoleucyl residue at position 95 in pigeon cytochrome c is essential for T cell recognition. This series, when compared with a series containing the same native sequences but without the leader sequence, also showed that the presence of the leader sequence has a general effect on enhancement of T cell recognition. An analysis of the conformational preferences of the peptides using circular dichroism indicated that all of the peptides with leader sequences have a strong preference for the alpha-helical conformation in nonpolar solvents. However, the introduction of helix-breaking residues into these peptides, with a concomitant measured reduction in alpha-helix, did not affect their recognition by clone A.E7. This implies that factors other than conformational stabilization are responsible for the full potency of these peptides. Binding studies to phospholipid vesicles indicated that residues in the leader sequence and in the amino terminus of segment 81-104 beyond residue 95 were important in increasing the ability of the antigens to bind to membranes. These results suggest that the capacity to bind to membranes may be a significant factor in the dose response of T cells to exogenously presented peptides.\r"

  ".W": "A rat hybridoma producing a high-affinity IgG2a monoclonal antibody (B3B4) directed against against the murine lymphocyte IgE receptor (Fc epsilon R) was established by using purified Fc epsilon R from Fc epsilon R+ murine hybridoma B cells as immunogen. The monoclonal and polyclonal anti-Fc epsilon R inhibited the binding of IgE to the murine lymphocyte Fc epsilon R and were also used to isolate the Fc epsilon R. B3B4 specifically recognized only the 49-Kd Fc epsilon R on murine B lymphocyte as determined by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis. In addition to its reaction with intact Fc epsilon R, B3B4 also recognized Fc epsilon R fragments that were present in the culture media of Fc epsilon R+ hybridoma cells. The predominant fragments isolated were 38 Kd and 28 Kd by SDS-PAGE analysis. When tested for reactivity with other cell types, B3B4 was highly specific for murine B lineage cells in that it did not significantly react with Fc epsilon R on macrophages and T cells and, in addition, did not react with the high affinity mast cell Fc epsilon R. B3B4 completely blocked IgE rosetting, and a reciprocal inhibition of binding was seen in a dose-dependent fashion between IgE and B3B4, indicating a close proximity of the IgE and B3B4 binding sites. Saturation binding analysis indicated that the Fab' fragment of B3B4 bound to twice as many sites/cell as IgE, suggesting that there are two identical B3B4 determinants per 49-Kd Fc epsilon R or that the IgE binding site is formed by the association of at least two 49-Kd Fc epsilon R. However, unlike IgE, neither B3B4 nor F(ab')2-B3B4 nor Fab'-B3B4 were very effective in causing Fc epsilon R upregulation on murine hybridoma B cells; in fact, B3B4 prevented this upregulation when added in combination with IgE. These results suggest that a site-specific interaction provided only by IgE may be essential for ligand-specific upregulation. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies will be useful in further studies concerning the functional relationship between the membrane Fc epsilon R and the soluble Fc epsilon R fragments.\r"

Pretreatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes with mAb 8/1 plus complement abrogated the proliferative response in vitro to mitogen, soluble antigen, and MHC determinants. Dual-parameter immunofluorescence revealed that resting porcine T8+ as well as T4+ lymphocytes express the 8/1 antigen, whereas after in vitro activation, cell surface expression of the antigen was low or absent in both T cell subsets. Thus, the 8/1 antigen represents a marker that discriminates between resting and activated T lymphocytes. Distribution and functional criteria indicate that 8/1 represents a novel marker not described before for any other mammalian species.\r"

  ".W": "C1 activation is controlled by the regulatory protein C1-inhibitor (C1-INH). In contrast to immune-complex-induced activation, which is insensitive to C1-INH, antibody-independent activation of C1 is modulated by C1-INH. The mechanisms regulating nonimmune activation were studied with two phospholipids varying in their capacity to activate C1 in the presence of C1-INH: cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). Whereas C1-INH consistently suppressed activation by PG vesicles, a dose-dependent increase in C1 activation was measured with CL vesicles above 40 mole %. A similar dose-response binding of C1s requiring C1q, but not C1r, was detected only on CL vesicles, but neither on PG vesicles nor on immune complexes. This binding was Ca2+-dependent, suggesting that dimeric C1s is involved and was inhibited by spermine. The C1q-bound C1s was specifically cleaved at 37 degrees C into its active 58 kDa and 28 kDa chains, in the absence of C1r. On the addition of anti-CL antibodies, the C1q-mediated cleavage of C1s by CL vesicles was specifically inhibited. The cleavage of C1r on CL vesicles was also determined. When macromolecular C1 was offered in the presence of C1-INH, C1r cleavage was detected; however, the presence of C1s was a critical factor for C1r activation, because it was required on CL vesicles, but not on immune complexes. These results show that nonimmune activation of C1 presents specific features which distinguish it from immune complex-induced activation. These characteristics varied with the capacity of antibody-independent activators to activate C1 in the presence of C1-INH.\r"

The exposure of human PBL to agents that cause DNA strand breaks to accumulate can deplete NAD pools by increasing NAD consumption for poly(ADP-ribose) formation. However, the pathways of NAD synthesis and degradation in viable PBL have not been carefully documented. The present experiments have used radioactive labeling techniques to trace the routes of NAD metabolism in resting PBL. The cells could generate NAD from either nicotinamide or nicotinic acid. PBL incubated with [14C]nicotinic acid excreted [14C]nicotinamide into the medium. Approximately 50% of a prelabeled [14C]NAD pool was metabolized during 6 to 8 hr in tissue culture. Basal NAD turnover was prolonged threefold to fourfold by 3-aminobenzamide (3-ABA), an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase. Supplementation of the medium with 3-ABA also prevented the accelerated NAD degradation that ensued after exposure of PBL to deoxyadenosine plus deoxycoformycin at concentrations previously shown to cause DNA strand break accumulation. These results demonstrate that quiescent human PBL continually produce NAD and utilize the nucleotide for poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis.\r"

  ".U": "87139230\r", 
  ".W": "The complement-derived anaphylatoxin peptides, C3a and C5a, have long been considered to manifest their spasmogenic activities primarily through stimulation of mast cells. Although mast cells represent the major non-circulating repository for histamine, these cells also elaborate a number of additional, highly potent spasmogenic mediators derived from arachidonic acid. The same lipid mediators can be released by many other cell types. As a result, evaluation of the role of mast cells in anaphylatoxin-dependent responses cannot be based exclusively upon an analysis of the mediators released. We evaluated the role of mast cells in anaphylatoxin-induced ileal smooth muscle contractions by testing isolated segments of ileal tissues derived from genetically mast cell-deficient mice and their congenic normal (+/+) littermates. Isolated tissues from either congenic normal (+/+) or mast cell-deficient Sl/Sld mice responded similarly to acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, prostaglandin E2, and the thromboxane A2 analog, U-46619. At 1 microgram/ml, histamine induced contractions of greater magnitude in tissues from mast cell-deficient animals; however, this mediator also desensitized the tissues to repeat challenge with histamine at the same concentration. C5a at 1 nM resulted in contractions equivalent to approximately 50% of the maximal KCl response; normal and mast cell-deficient tissues responded in a similar manner. C5a also released histamine from the normal mouse ileum, in addition to causing contraction of the tissues. C3a at 200 nM also produced similar contractile responses in both +/+ and S1/S1d tissues. These studies show that the anaphylatoxin peptides C3a and C5a are capable of contracting smooth muscle-containing tissues by a mechanism completely independent of mast cells. In addition, we also demonstrated that mast cell degranulation does not necessarily provoke ileal contraction. Thus compound 48/80, a mast cell degranulating agent unrelated to the anaphylatoxins, did not induce contractions in ileal tissues, even when used at concentrations as high as 100 micrograms/ml. Compound 48/80 did release histamine from the +/+ ileum, however, indicating that the agent was able to cause degranulation of ileal mast cells. Taken together, these data indicate that spasmogenic responses to anaphylatoxins (and possibly other agents) that are associated with mast cell degranulation need not necessarily require mast cell mediator release for their expression.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 1 (IL 1) is a principal mediator of the host immune response to microbial challenge. Accessory cells of the monocyte-macrophage series are a major source of this cytokine and are also chronically parasitized by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. This suggests that characterization of the macrophage IL 1 response to Leishmania would increase our understanding of the regulation of host immunity to these organisms. In the present study, the macrophage IL 1 response to Leishmania donovani was examined because infections with this organism have findings consistent with parasite-specific T cell unresponsiveness. Cytokine activity was measured either by direct stimulation or by co-stimulation of thymocytes. Conditioned media from BALB/c resident peritoneal macrophages infected with amastigotes of L. donovani contained no more IL 1 than did supernatant fluids of control cells. In contrast, supernatants from cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes had significantly increased cytokine content. Resident cells infected with L. donovani for 4 hr before being stimulated with Listeria demonstrated a suppressed IL 1 response (approximately 40% of Listeria alone) to this secondary particulate stimulus. In contrast, the secondary response of leishmania-preinfected cells to lipopolysaccharide was not affected. To examine whether accessory cell nonresponsiveness to L. donovani (with respect to IL 1) was related to the state of macrophage activation, elicited peritoneal macrophages obtained by injection of proteose peptone were also studied. These cells responded to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and fixed Staphylococcus aureus with increases in intracellular, membrane, and secreted cytokine activities. In contrast, L. donovani failed to induce any of these activities. This was found to be the case irrespective of whether amastigotes were alive or killed or opsonized with specific antibodies. Elicited cells preinfected with Leishmania responded normally to secondary stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, but not S. aureus (64% of Staphylococcus alone). In addition, attachment and penetration of L. donovani promastigotes and their subsequent conversion to amastigotes within macrophages failed to induce IL 1 synthesis. The findings of this study indicate that L. donovani has the ability to both evade and suppress the macrophage IL 1 response. Because this monokine provides an obligatory signal during macrophage-dependent T cell activation, evasion of signal transduction for IL 1 synthesis may be related to defects in cell-mediated immunity which occur during infections with this organism.\r"

The autoreactive T cells caused extensive necrosis at the injection site. A treatment regime consisting of two successive injections of anti-I-Ab monoclonal antibody 3JP prevented the inhibition of tumor growth, supporting the hypothesis that the autoreactive T cells inhibited the growth of melanomas by releasing LT and IFN-gamma upon recognition of I-A antigen-bearing cells at the injection site. The CGG-specific control T cells did not cause necrosis and survived within the nests of uninhibited tumor cells. Autoreactive T cells administered i.v. immediately after i.v. injection of B16 melanoma cells markedly reduced pulmonary metastases, whereas CGG-specific T cells did not. These results indicate that autoreactive T cells can function in vivo as inhibitors of tumor growth.\r"

  ".W": "The incubation of murine splenocytes in recombinant interleukin 2 (RIL 2) gives rise to lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells that can lyse fresh, NK-resistant tumor cells but not normal cells in 4-hr 51Cr-release assays. Lysis by this IL 2-activated cell population was enhanced up to 100-fold by prior reaction of target cells with specific antisera reactive with antigens on the target cells. This antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) also resulted in lysis of fresh normal target cells, which are not usually susceptible to LAK lysis. The ADCC was evident after 24 hr of incubation of splenocytes in RIL 2, but peak lytic activity was reached after 3 to 4 days of incubation. The concentrations of RIL 2 needed for the in vitro activation of the effectors in order to attain maximal ADCC was between 100 and 3000 U/ml and parallel the IL 2 concentrations required to generate LAK cells. ADCC mediated by IL 2-activated splenocytes was completely blocked by anti-FcR monoclonal antibodies. Although antisera directed against MHC antigens were used in most experiments, anti-B16 monoclonal antibodies have also shown the ability to induce ADCC mediated by RIL 2-activated syngeneic and allogeneic cells. Treatment of the precursor splenocyte populations with anti-asialo GM1 and complement eliminated the direct LAK activity and the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, suggesting that both direct and indirect tumor cell lysis may be caused by the same effector cell. ADCC mediated by LAK cell populations represents another possible mechanism for the in vivo therapeutic effects of these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Although the intracellular ultrastructural processing of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor have been described in cell culture systems, very few studies have examined this phenomenon in intact tissues. We have examined the ultrastructural and biochemical handling of [125I]EGF in the epidermis and hair follicle bulb of intact, viable, 3- to 5-day-old rat skin the EGF receptor distribution of which has already been documented and in which EGF has been shown to be biologically active. After incubation of explants with 10 nM [125I]EGF for 2.5 h at 25 degrees or 37 degrees C, radiolabel was detected over the basal cells of the epidermis and hair follicle outer root sheath, confirming previous light microscope observations. More specifically, silver grains were observed near coated and uncoated plasma membrane and coated membrane invaginations, Golgi apparatus, lysosomal structures, and nuclei. Sodium azide inhibited internalization of label, whereas a series of lysosomal inhibitors (chloroquine, monensin, and iodoacetamide) caused a slight increase in silver grains associated with lysosomal vesicles and a decrease in nuclear label. Biochemical analysis indicated that greater than 35% of radioactivity following incubation at 37 degrees C was in the form of degraded [125I]EGF fragments and that inclusion of chloroquine, monensin, and iodoacetamide reduced this value to 20.8%, 8.6%, and 4.0%, respectively. In addition, chloramine T-prepared [125I]EGF was found to be covalently cross-linked with low efficiency to a protein having the molecular weight of the EGF receptor. These data are discussed in the light of the effects of EGF on epithelial cell proliferation in skin.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in rodents have shown that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may have direct effects on the immune system in the skin and at higher doses may induce systemic suppression of immune responses. We have previously shown that UVR from sun or solarium beds may induce systemic effects in human subjects. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether these systemic effects in human subjects could be prevented by use of commercially available sunscreen agents. Groups of 12 normal subjects were exposed to radiation from solarium lamps after application of a sunscreen agent or the base used in its preparation. Twelve half-hourly exposures induced a depression of natural killer (NK) cell activity against a melanoma and the K562 target cell which was not prevented by use of the sunscreen agent. Changes in functional activity were accompanied by a reduction in NK cell numbers assessed by Leu-11 monoclonal antibodies against the labile Fc receptor. Application of the sunscreen agent also did not protect against effects of solarium exposure on recall antigen skin tests and immunoglobulin production in vitro in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated cultures of B and T cells. These results suggest that further evaluation of the wave-length spectrum of UVR and the effectiveness of sunscreen agents in prevention of UVR-induced effects on the immune system is needed.\r"

  ".W": "Transepidermal migration of leukocytes, with resultant formation of microscopic or macroscopic sterile subcorneal pustules is a phenomenon characteristically noted in psoriasis and related sterile pustular dermatoses. It is natural to assume the presence of potent neutrophil chemotactic substances in the subcorneal portion of the lesional epidermis, because this location is the target of the in vivo leukocyte chemotaxis. In fact, crude psoriasis scale extracts show remarkably high neutrophil chemotactic and activating properties as compared with those of other non-psoriatic inflammatory dermatoses. We isolated a psoriatic leukotactic factor (PLF) having a molecular mass of around 12 kD, distinct from those common to other inflammatory changes involving the skin or those released by bacteria. Further analysis of PLF identified C5 cleavage fragments, together with other chemotactic peptides, such as those derived from monocytes. Likewise, potent low-molecular-mass chemotactic factors, including cell membrane lipid derived chemotactic factor, e.g. leukotriene B4, are also increased in psoriatic lesions, as in other nonpsoriatic inflammatory dermatoses. However, their activity to stimulate the generation of oxygen radicals in neutrophils was found to be much weaker than that of PLF. The peripheral blood leukocytes from active psoriatic patients show enhanced function in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, active oxygen production, and enzyme release; patients' sera contain substances such as anaphylatoxins that activate leukocyte function. Further research is required for clearer understanding of the series of events resulting in the leukocyte chemotaxis, as well as for the elucidation of the background immunoregulatory mechanisms.\r"

Early rashes appearing within the first six weeks after vaccination are invariably due to vaccine virus. True breakthrough infections with wild-type VZV also occur in vaccinees. Five cases of zoster have been seen in leukemic children vaccinated while in remission. One case appeared 22 months after vaccination in the same general area as the inoculation. The virus isolated was vaccine derived. A second case of zoster appeared in a dermatome unrelated to the sites of vaccination approximately 19 months after apparently natural varicella. This virus was wild type. Vaccine virus can therefore establish latency and can later reactivate as herpes zoster.\r"

Keratinocyte cultures then developed characteristic cytopathic changes, and antiviral activity was found in culture supernatant media. All such activity from these supernatants was neutralized with specific antiserum to IFN-beta but not with antiserum to IFN-alpha. No IFN-gamma was detectable by radioimmunoassay. Immunoperoxidase staining with antiserum to IFN-beta in five biopsy specimens from culture-proven, recurrent herpes simplex lesions showed positive staining of epidermal keratinocytes but not of dermal or infiltrating cells. Thus, the primary sources of IFN-beta in recurrent herpes lesion vesicles are the virus-infected keratinocytes.\r"

Mice that had previously recovered from herpes simplex virus infection of the ear pinna, when subsequently reinfected in the flank, showed restricted viral replication in the skin and cleared virus more rapidly than did animals experiencing primary infection. B cell suppression did not compromise the ability of mice to resist reinfection compared with the ability of normal immune animals.

Because cimetidine (a histamine-2 antagonist) has been shown to alter human lymphocyte function in vitro, we decided to study cimetidine's effect on peripheral blood NK activity of patients with B-CLL and controls. We administered cimetidine orally (1.2 gm per day) to seven patients with B-CLL and 12 controls for up to 28 days. Peripheral blood NK activity of patients with B-CLL rose from a pretreatment level of 0.7 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SEM) lytic units/10(6) cells (LU) to 8.7 +/- 2.4 LU (P less than 0.05) at day 28. Peripheral blood NK activity of controls decreased after 14 days of cimetidine treatment but returned to pretreatment levels by day 28. When peripheral blood cells from controls were exposed to cimetidine during in vitro incubation (10 micrograms/ml), mean NK activity was increased at 48 hours (54% +/- 22% increase over controls, n = 5, P less than 0.05). Single cell cytotoxicity assays revealed increased killing of target cells (but not effector-target conjugation) with cimetidine-exposed effector cells. These data suggest that cimetidine may be useful to augment peripheral blood NK activity for patients with B-CLL.\r"

Because marked augmentation of the titer of Hageman factor is brought about by the administration of estrogens in humans and by prolactin or estrogen infusion in hypophysectomized rats, we measured the plasma concentrations of estradiol, prolactin, and clotting factors participating in surface-mediated reactions of coagulation in survivors of myocardial infarction. We observed higher titers of Hageman factor, prolactin, and high molecular weight kininogen but no significant change in estradiol or prekallikrein in survivors of myocardial infarction compared with controls. The titer of Hageman factor tended to be directly associated with the prolactin titer. We also report an increase in factor VII activity and spontaneous shortening of prothrombin time in the cold-stored plasma of survivors of myocardial infarction. In such individuals as well as in the control group, the titer of Hageman factor appeared to be responsible for half of the observed increase in factor VII activity and two thirds of the observed shortening of prothrombin time. These data indicate that although the titer of Hageman factor strongly influences the cold activation of factor VII, other factors may affect these phenomena.\r"

The patient had the symptoms of cerebral achromatopsia, and the relative preservation of his form vision (when his reduced acuity is taken into account) and his achromatic vision supports the view that the many different visual cortical areas recently demonstrated in the brains of monkeys, and presumed to exist in man, have a perceptual specialisation that matches their physiological differences.\r"

Axons without myelin sheaths were prevalent within EAE spinal cords. Often these axons were associated with astrocytic processes, though membrane specializations were not observed at these sites. The demyelinated axons exhibited a highly asymmetrical partitioning of intramembranous particles (IMP), with approximately 2,000 particles/micron2 on P-faces and approximately 150/micron2 on E-faces. This distribution and density of IMP is similar to myelinated internodal membrane. The IMP were generally randomly distributed along the axons. However, in some regions, E-faces of demyelinated axons without paranodal-like membrane specialization in the vicinity displayed a greater than normal (approximately 500/micron2) particle density. Many of the IMP in these regions of increased density were of a large (greater than 10 nm) diameter. Axonal membrane bounded by a single set of paranodal oligodendroglial loops ('heminodal') was also observed, and the axolemma adjacent to the terminal glial loop exhibited a gradient of morphologies. The E-faces of presumed heminodal membrane most often displayed a moderately low density of IMP. However, in several instances, heminodal membrane exhibited a moderately high IMP density (approximately 1,100/micron2), similar to that observed within normal nodal membrane. In all cases, a high percentage of the E-face IMP within heminodal membrane were large. The results demonstrate that acute demyelination is associated with a maintenance of the integrity of certain components of the axolemma and an apparent dedifferentiation in other constituents.\r"

  ".W": "In order to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone (dex) in reducing the toxicity of therapy with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2), we treated six patients receiving this form of immunotherapy with intravenous (IV) dex, 4 mg every six hours. Compared with a control group of 27 patients not receiving dex with their immunotherapy, these corticosteroid-treated patients were able to tolerate the administration of more IL-2, yet experienced significantly less toxicity. Dyspnea, confusion, fever, mean peak serum creatinine, and bilirubin levels during treatment were significantly reduced in corticosteroid-treated patients, with a corresponding decrease in pruritus in this group as well. Overall weight gain was not different between groups, although a curtailment of weight gain temporally related to dex treatment was seen in some patients. Hematologic side effects, including anemia, eosinophilia, and thrombocytopenia, were not reduced by dex. These results suggest that dex can inhibit at least some of the toxic side effects of LAK cell and IL-2 therapy. Because of the concern that the therapeutic effect may also be abrogated, future studies combining corticosteroids with this form of immunotherapy should be undertaken with caution.\r"

  ".W": "Pain relief following stimulation of the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) or periventricular gray matter (PVG) in man has been ascribed to stimulation-induced release of endogenous opioid substances. Forty-five patients were studied and followed for at least 1 year after placement of chronic stimulating electrodes in the PAG or PVG to determine if pain relief due to stimulation could be ascribed to an endogenous opioid mechanism. Three criteria were assessed: the development of tolerance to stimulation; the possibility of cross-tolerance to morphine; and reversibility of stimulation-induced pain relief by the opiate antagonist naloxone. Sixteen patients (35.6%) developed tolerance to stimulation, that is, they obtained progressively less effective pain relief. Twelve (44.4%) of 27 patients undergoing stimulation of the thalamic sensory relay nuclei for treatment of chronic pain (a presumably non-opioid mechanism) also developed tolerance. Morphine sulfate was administered in a blind, placebo-controlled protocol to 10 patients who had become tolerant to PAG-PVG stimulation and none showed evidence of cross-tolerance. Fifteen of 19 patients, already tolerant to morphine at the time of PAG-PVG electrode implantation, experienced excellent pain relief by stimulation, also indicating a lack of cross-tolerance. Twenty-two patients who experienced excellent pain relief from chronic PAG-PVG stimulation received intravenous naloxone in a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. Pain intensity as assessed by the visual analog scale was increased to the same degree by both placebo and naloxone. Eight patients showed no increase in pain intensity with either placebo or naloxone. Although tolerance to PAG-PVG stimulation developed in these patients, the frequency of tolerance was similar to that seen in patients undergoing thalamic sensory nuclear stimulation. Since the latter technique presumably relieves pain by a non-opioid mechanism, the development of tolerance to PAG-PVG stimulation does not, in itself, confirm an opioid mechanism. Cross-tolerance between PAG-PVG stimulation and morphine was not seen and cross-tolerance to PAG-PVG stimulation in patients already tolerant to morphine was rare. The pain-relieving effect of PAG-PVG stimulation was reversed to an approximately equal degree by naloxone and placebo. The authors do not believe that, in most patients, pain relief elicited by PAG-PVG stimulation depends on an endogenous opioid mechanism. It appears that other, non-opioid mechanisms are primarily responsible for such pain relief.\r"

A simple RTB labeling procedure achieving 99% tagging of the 131I-TB was used. The RTB was found to be a highly specific parathyroid radiotracer, consequently enabling superimposition of the delineated thyroid gland over the RTB avid parathyroid foci without a need for subtraction of the thyroid or vascular background. Forty-six patients with primary hyperparathyroidism underwent scintigraphic study prior to cervical (41 patients) or mediastinal (5 patients) exploration and 67 pathological parathyroid glands (34 adenomas and 33 hyperplasias) were excised. On follow-up, serum calcium level returned to normal in all patients. Correlation of the scintigraphic results with the surgical findings disclosed a sensitivity of 93%, with a specificity of 80% and an overall accuracy of 87%. This new simplified and specific RTB scintigraphic method justifies its use as a routine procedure for preoperative parathyroid scintigraphic localization in primary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

The extent of hypoperfused myocardium was calculated as a percentage of slice mass on rest-redistribution 201TI SPECT. Pathologic IS was determined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. On each tomogram, SPECT IS was defined as the % of the maximum-count circumferential profile points falling below normal. To calculate total LV infarct size, slice ISs were added to one another after each was multiplied by a coefficient K that reflected the contribution of that slice to the total left ventricular mass. K was derived from an observed relationship in normal dogs between slice fractional distance from the apex and either its actual weight, its geometric SPECT area, or its count-based SPECT area, the assessment of which was independent of edge detection. Using any of these algorithms, there was a high linear correlation between the tomographic and TTC IS. A similar algorithm was also developed from tomograms of eight normal patients. These data offer promise for the clinical noninvasive assessment of the extent of hypoperfused myocardium.\r"

Many authors have reported a decrease of cytotoxic/suppressor T lymphocytes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in contrast to the results of other workers. We believe that the discrepancy between the various studies is due to the fact that different methods and different criteria for patient selection were used. Our study comprised a larger number of patients which makes the results suitable for statistical inference. Disease activity is clearly defined and all drugs that could alter the results were excluded. The use of a flow cytometer enhances the reliability of T lymphocyte subset determination by monoclonal antibodies (OKT series). Our study confirms the reports, which suggested that the number of suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes (OKT8+ cells/mm3) is decreased in patients with active RA, resulting in a high T helper/inducer lymphocyte/T suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocyte ratio (OKT4+:OKT8+). This immune balance represents an interesting feature of the disease, since several active antirheumatic drugs share a common immunomodulatory action, which normalizes the OKT4+:OKT8+ ratio. Finally, we found a good correlation between the OKT4+ cells and OKT8+ cells in the normal control population. This observation enabled us to isolate a subgroup of active patients with RA not responding to slow acting antirheumatic drugs and characterized by a low OKT4+:OKT8+ ratio.\r"

Consequently, an HLA-B27 associated disease process seems to be the cause of heart block development in 15 to 20% of Caucasian pacemaker treated men. The purpose of our study was to find out if the HLA-B27 associated disease process was equally common in pacemaker treated women. Eighty-five pacemaker treated women with second and third degree heart block were HLA typed for B27, and HLA-B27 positive individuals were further examined for the presence of associated rheumatic disorders. HLA-B27 was present in 7 women, 8.2%, similar to the frequency in the general population, and none of them had an associated rheumatic disease. Thus, there is a significant sex linked difference in the susceptibility to HLA-B27 associated heart block.\r"

Since C1q participates in the inflammatory response and contains a collagen-like sequence, we have tested, in vitro, the putative generation and immunologic activity of C1q peptide fragments under physical conditions present in burned patients. Nanogram quantities of heat- and enzyme-generated fragments of C1q were shown to be suppressive in vitro to neutrophil chemotaxis, and the mixed lymphocyte response (MLR). The addition of lymphocytes pretreated with C1q fragments suppressed ongoing MLR, indicating the activation of suppressor cells by the peptides. Rabbit anti-C1q globulin was found to reduce the suppressive activity of the collagen-like suppressor which was isolated from human burn sera. Our results therefore suggest that C1q may be an early source of degradation peptides which have strong nonspecific immunosuppressive activity following thermal injuries.\r"

An additional 636 cases of pertussis--115 of which would be associated with complications, including two encephalopathies--were projected to occur under the proposed as compared to the current schedule. Adverse medical events attributable to the vaccine were assumed to remain unchanged following the change in schedule. We projected 353 fewer chance associations with sudden infant death syndrome but 1311 more chance associations between DTP and seizures.

  ".W": "The in vivo significance of suppressor macrophages for antitumor immunity was investigated in a syngeneic tumor system. The presence of suppressor macrophages in the spleens of X5563 C3H/HeN tumor-bearing mice (TBM) was directly shown in vitro. Thus the addition of splenic macrophages of TBM suppressed the in vitro secondary induction of both tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cells and effector cells of the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Splenic macrophages of TBM exerted suppression on tumor-specific T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the effector phase as well. Prostaglandin production was found to be one of the major mechanisms involved in macrophage-induced suppression. In vivo treatment of TBM with carrageenan and/or indomethacin retarded tumor growth and in parallel augmented cell-mediated cytotoxicity against X5563 cells, probably by affecting suppressor macrophages in vivo. The suppressive effect of splenic macrophages from TBM was clearly demonstrated in a tumor-neutralization test indicating that suppressor macrophages were able to exert their function in vivo as well as in vitro. All these results suggested that suppressor macrophages had in vivo significance for the suppression of the immunosurveillance of the hosts.\r"

Total serum and salivary IgA were unchanged. Serum IgA profile (HPLC-ELISA) showed increases in polymer IgA (three of six). No such changes were found during URTI in controls. These findings support the view that an exaggerated IgA response to mucosal antigen challenge initiates glomerular damage and hematuria in IgAN.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-three patients underwent coronary artery bypass during acute evolving myocardial infarction 6.8 +/- 2.8 hours after the onset of symptoms. Linear discriminant analysis of preoperative variables identified predictors of mortality with an accuracy of 84%. Significant predictors in decreasing order of importance were cardiogenic shock, age over 65 years, left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.30, cardiac index less than or equal to 2.0 L/min/m2, and absent collateral flow. Time to reperfusion did not influence outcome nor did the infarct-related artery. Hospital mortality was 15.6% (13/83). Among 51 low-risk patients under 65 years of age without cardiogenic shock, there were three deaths (5.9%). Follow-up angiography was performed in 21 patients. The graft patency rate was 94%. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 0.39 +/- 0.10 to 0.49 +/- 0.11 (p less than 0.05). Left ventricular end-systolic volume decreased from 53.2 +/- 19.3 ml/m2 to 41.4 +/- 16.8 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05), and end-diastolic volume remained unchanged: 86.2 +/- 21.2 ml/m2 before operation and 78.7 +/- 24.0 ml/m2 after operation (no significant difference). Regional ejection fraction of the infarct area, determined by the centerline method, increased 0.23 +/- 0.15. In contrast, among 215 patients treated by nonsurgical reperfusion (intracoronary thrombolysis or angioplasty, or both), mortality was 13.5%. In this group, reperfusion was successful in 144 patients (67%) and 89 underwent follow-up angiography. Persistent patency of the infarct artery was demonstrated in 73 (82%). Ejection fraction increased from 0.45 +/- 0.10 to 0.50 +/- 0.15 (p less than 0.05). We conclude that preoperative variables enable identification of patients with evolving acute myocardial infarction in whom coronary artery bypass is associated with low operative mortality and improved ventricular performance.\r"

Fifty-five of these 316 patients had postoperative bundle branch block (Group 1). This group had a higher incidence of left main coronary stenosis, together with previous inferior myocardial infarction, than patients without postoperative conduction disturbances (Group 2). Perioperative myocardial infarction, low cardiac output, and death were significantly more common in Group 1 than in Group 2: 7.3% versus 1.9% for perioperative myocardial infarction, 16.4% versus 2.7% for low cardiac output, and 5.5% versus 0.8% for death. Analysis of the type of conduction disturbances indicates that the presence of a new complete left bundle branch block postoperatively in a patient undergoing coronary artery bypass is a sign of intraoperative myocardial damage. This damage is potentially lethal, especially in a patient with left main coronary stenosis and previous inferior myocardial infarction.\r"

Early recatheterization showed patency of the polytetrafluoroethylene graft, but a myocardial scintiscan done 3 months after operation demonstrated reduced perfusion of the areas supplied by the left coronary system.

The donors selected were compatible in ABO and RBC-specific antigen systems but mismatched for the HLA antigen in question. Haemolytic transfusion reactions occurred in all four patients who received HLA-B7-incompatible RBC. A direct radioimmune anti-IgG test became positive, Cr51-RBC survival was very short (22.3, 36.9, 41.4, and 44.0 days), and excess sequestration in the spleen was measured. There was a rise in serum lactic dehydrogenase and a fall in haptoglobin. HLA-B7 antibody was detected in the eluate prepared from RBC collected after transfusion. A similar reaction was found in only one further patient, caused by an HLA-A2 incompatibility. No indications of immune-mediated RBC sequestration were discernible after transfusion of HLA-B7-compatible RBC in one of the patients who had shown a reaction with HLA-B7-incompatible blood, nor in any of the other patients who received HLA-B7-compatible RBC. The haemolytic transfusion reactions could not be anticipated by conventional crossmatch procedures, nor by the measurement of the Cr51-RBC survival 1 h after transfusion.\r"

Among the 27 patients who met all the study's entry criteria, the response rate was 96 percent, with 16 patients (59 percent) entering complete remission and 10 patients (37 percent) partial remission. In one patient no response was observed. These results were not significantly changed by the inclusion of nine additional patients who were found retrospectively not to have fulfilled the entry criteria. When complete remission was attained, maintenance therapy was not given. Despite this, no patient has had a relapse, and the duration of complete remission ranges from 1 to 375 days. Pentostatin appears to be equally effective in untreated patients and in those who have progressive disease after splenectomy or after both splenectomy and treatment with interferon. Whether pentostatin is superior to splenectomy or interferon as therapy for hairy-cell leukemia will have to be assessed by direct comparison in randomized studies. Lengthy follow-up will be required to determine a median duration for the responses of hairy-cell leukemia to pentostatin.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of adoptive immunotherapy with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells plus interleukin-2 or therapy with high-dose interleukin-2 alone in 157 patients with metastatic cancer for whom standard therapy had proved ineffective or no standard effective treatment was available. One hundred eight patients were treated with 127 courses of LAK cells plus interleukin-2, and 49 patients were treated with 53 courses of high-dose interleukin-2 alone. Of 106 evaluable patients receiving LAK cells plus interleukin-2, 8 had complete responses, 15 had partial responses, and 10 had minor responses. The median duration of response was 10 months among those with complete responses and 6 months among those with partial responses; the patient with the longest complete response was still in remission 22 months after treatment. Of 46 evaluable patients treated with high-dose interleukin-2 alone, 1 had a complete response (remission greater than 4 months), 5 had partial responses (2, greater than 3, greater than 5, 7, and greater than 11 months), and 1 had a minor response. Seven of the total of nine complete responses still remain in remission. Hypotension, weight gain, oliguria, and elevation of bilirubin and creatinine levels were common, but these side effects resolved promptly after interleukin-2 administration was stopped. There have been four treatment-related deaths among these 157 patients. This immunotherapeutic approach can result in marked tumor regression in some patients for whom no other effective therapy is available at present. Determining its ultimate role in cancer therapy awaits further attempts to increase the therapeutic efficacy of treatment and decrease its toxicity and complexity.\r"

  ".W": "Adoptive immunotherapy involving bolus-dose recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) has been reported to induce tumor regression in some patients with cancer, but has been associated with severe fluid retention and cardiopulmonary stress. In an effort to preserve the efficacy but reduce the toxicity of this treatment, we used escalating doses of rIL-2 as a constant infusion rather than as a bolus dose. Forty-eight patients with advanced cancer received rIL-2 as a 24-hour infusion in five-day cycles separated by five-day periods of rest and leukapheresis. Eight patients were removed from the study before receiving cells activated in vitro. In the 40 who could be evaluated for their response, there were 13 partial responses (32.5 percent) and 2 minor responses. Partial responses were observed in Hodgkin's disease (one of one), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (one of one), lung cancer (one of five), ovarian cancer (one of one), parotid cancer (one of two), renal cancer (three of six), and melanoma (five of ten). Responses were associated with a good performance status, a base-line lymphocyte count above 1400 per cubic millimeter, and an rIL-2-induced lymphocyte count of at least 6000. Optimal lymphocytosis required a priming dose of rIL-2 of 3 X 10(6) U per square meter of body-surface area per day, and 15 of 28 patients receiving this priming dose responded to treatment. A weight gain of more than 10 percent of total body weight (five patients) and dyspnea at rest (six patients) were unusual events restricted to patients with poorer pretreatment performance. We conclude that the administration of rIL-2 as a constant infusion may preserve the antineoplastic activity of adoptive immunotherapy while increasing the safety and comfort of patients.\r"
