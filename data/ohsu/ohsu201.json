Three men had prior diagnoses of Kaposi's sarcoma; none had acquired immune deficiency syndrome-defining opportunistic infections. Two patterns of illness were observed. Seven men had an acute, self-limited illness that was often accompanied by meningeal findings. The other seven had chronic headaches without signs of meningeal irritation and had less marked abnormalities of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count and protein. Encephalopathy was a finding in only one of 14 patients. In four of five CSF specimens studied, HIV was recovered. HIV has been associated with acute meningitis at the time of seroconversion and can apparently also cause sporadic episodes of acute or chronic meningitis in patients with prior infection and relatively preserved immune function. Both the clinical presentation with predominant headache rather than encephalopathy and the presence of CSF inflammation differentiate this syndrome from other HIV-related neurologic complications.\r"

There were 16 catheter infections (exit site or tunnel infection or both), seven episodes of peritonitis, and 10 episodes of catheter infections associated with peritonitis due to P. aeruginosa. Catheters were removed in 58 percent (19 of 33) of the infections due to P. aeruginosa, but in only 16 percent (104 of 663) of the infections due to other organisms (p less than 0.01). All P. aeruginosa catheter infections associated with P. aeruginosa peritonitis resulted in catheter loss. P. aeruginosa catheter infections not associated with peritonitis also often did not resolve with antibiotic therapy (nine of 16 or 56 percent of catheters removed compared with 42 of 317 or 13 percent of catheters removed for other organisms, p less than 0.01). However, P. aeruginosa peritonitis episodes that were not associated with a catheter infection were no more likely to result in catheter loss than were peritonitis episodes due to other organisms (one of seven compared with 37 of 256, 14 percent for both). It is concluded that catheter infections due to P. aeruginosa with or without associated peritonitis usually require catheter removal. Conversely, P. aeruginosa peritonitis without a catheter infection often does not require catheter removal.\r"

In 143 cases, acute neurologic or psychiatric symptoms were the primary complaint, and case-notes provided sufficient detail for analysis. The major neurologic complications included one or more seizures (n = 29), focal neurologic symptoms or signs (12), headache (10), and transient loss of consciousness (six). Psychiatric disturbances included agitation, anxiety, or depression (33), psychosis and paranoia (24), and suicidal ideation (18). The most serious consequences were found in patients with prolonged seizures or strokes, those who jumped out of buildings, and those who attempted suicide by overdosing with other drugs. There was no correlation between the appearance of complications and the reported route of administration, the amount of cocaine used, or prior experience with cocaine. The number of patients who are seeking hospital attention for these or related complaints appears to be rising substantially. Cocaine abuse, regardless of the use pattern, is associated with a variety of potentially severe neurologic and psychiatric complications.\r"

  ".U": "88046895\r", 
  ".W": "Since 1975, 10 families with the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)-2A syndrome and five with the MEN-2B syndrome, making a total of 101 patients, have been identified in The Netherlands. Twenty-three of the MEN-2A patients died before the start of the screening program. The average age of the patients whose death was due to pheochromocytoma (n = 11) or medullary thyroid carcinoma (n = 12) was 34.9 and 49.2 years, respectively. Eighty-seven patients with the MEN-2A syndrome and eight with the MEN-2B syndrome underwent thyroidectomy for C-cell hyperplasia and/or medullary thyroid carcinoma. Eighteen patients had signs or symptoms caused by MEN-2A (group A), 60 were relatives of these patients who had been found to be affected at the first screening of the family (group B), and nine relatives had had negative screening results that later became positive (group C). Five patients had signs or symptoms due to MEN-2B (group A) and three were relatives of these patients who had been found to be affected at the initial screening (group B). To assess the effect of screening, we compared these groups with respect to the occurrence of metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma at thyroidectomy and the results of the postoperative calcitonin tests. Among the MEN-2A families, 72 percent of group A, 33 percent of group B, and none of group C were found to have metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma at surgery. In the MEN-2B families, all five patients in group A and one of the three patients in group B had metastatic disease. The \"cure rates\" in these three groups with MEN-2A, as determined by stimulated calcitonin assessment, were 11, 57, and 100 percent, respectively. One of the five patients with MEN-2B in group A and two of the three patients in group B showed normalization of the stimulated calcitonin value after surgery. From these results, it may be concluded that screening can lead to the detection of medullary thyroid carcinoma in an earlier stage, which in turn may permit curative treatment and improvement of both prognosis and life expectancy. The need for supervision of affected families by central registration to promote periodic examination and to guarantee the continuity of such screening is discussed.\r"

Hormone levels in men with severe ASCAD documented at angiography were compared with those in men found to be virtually free from disease and with those in a group of control subjects without signs or symptoms of ASCAD. Significantly lower total testosterone levels were observed among men with severe ASCAD compared with either control group; the free testosterone level was significantly lower than in angiographically disease-free control subjects. The same pattern of hormone levels persisted after control of covariates. Epidemiologic analysis demonstrated a fivefold decrease in risk for severe ASCAD between the lowest and the highest quartile of total testosterone. No overall pattern of association was seen between ASCAD and free or total estrogens.\r"

  ".W": "There is increasing evidence that constant nitrate plasma levels, as induced by at least three-times-daily ingestions of isosorbide dinitrate in sustained-release form, lead to an attenuation or even complete loss of the anti-ischemic effects (nitrate tolerance). Therefore, the dependence of tolerance development on dosage intervals according to once-daily and twice-daily ingestions was assessed. Tablets of isosorbide dinitrate (80 mg) in sustained-release form were administered once-daily at 8 A.M. (dosage interval 24 hours) or twice-daily at 8 A.M. and 8 P.M. (dosage interval 12 hours), as well as at 8 A.M. and 2 P.M., respectively (maximal dosage interval 18 hours). A total of 34 patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease, a history of stable, exercise-dependent angina pectoris, and a reproducible, exercise-induced ST-segment depression of at least 0.15 mV (1.5 mm), who initially showed a response to 80 mg of isosorbide dinitrate, were enrolled. The anti-ischemic effects of isosorbide dinitrate on exercise-induced ischemia were objectively determined by the measurement of exercise-induced ST-segment depression before as well as two, six, and 12 hours after the ingestion at the first and the 15th day of the studies. Since the dosage interval of 12 hours resulted in constant plasma levels, the initially beneficial anti-ischemic effects of isosorbide dinitrate were considerably attenuated after two weeks of treatment. In contrast, the once-daily regimen with its intermittent peaks and valleys of nitrate plasma levels showed identical anti-ischemic effects at the 15th day as compared with the first day. Ingestions at 8 A.M. and 2 P.M. also circumvented the development of nitrate tolerance, however, combined with an even more pronounced anti-ischemic effect after 12 hours as compared with the once-daily regimen. Thus, the circumvention of nitrate tolerance requires a daily \"nitrate-poor\" interval. The best compromise between a maximal possible anti-ischemic effect and the circumvention of tolerance development was found for the \"eccentric\" dosage regimen in which the tablets were ingested in the morning and early afternoon.\r"

The average length of follow-up has now been greater than 10 years since initial biopsy. Patients with mesangial lesions (World Health Organization [WHO] classes IIA and IIB) had a more favorable renal and patient survival at five and 10 years than did patients in the other WHO classes (III, IV, and V). Individual renal histologic features of activity and chronicity when combined into an activity index and a chronicity index did not significantly predict renal survival in this population, nor did the presence of hypertension or renal dysfunction at the time of the initial renal biopsy significantly influence renal or patient survival. Patients with the nephrotic syndrome at initial biopsy had a poorer renal survival than did patients without the nephrotic syndrome. However, patients who experienced a remission of the nephrotic syndrome fared better in terms of both renal and patient survival than did those patients without a remission. By life-table analysis, patient survival was significantly better for patients in whom biopsy was performed after 1973 than for those in whom biopsy was performed prior to that time despite similar clinical features and WHO histology in each group interval. Our data suggest that improved survival for patients in recent studies may relate to better supportive care and more selective use of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with milder forms of lupus nephritis.\r"

The effects of orally administered hydralazine on ventilation and blood gas values were evaluated after six to 18 months of treatment in 10 male patients who had demonstrated an increase in minute ventilation after 24 hours of treatment. Hydralazine was administered at a dose of 200 mg per day during the initial 24 hours and in doses ranging from 40 mg per day to 200 mg per day during long-term therapy. Following 24 hours of treatment, a statistically significant increase in minute ventilation, alveolar ventilation, and PaO2, and reduction in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) were seen both at rest and during exercise. After six to 18 months of hydralazine therapy, the increase in minute ventilation at rest persisted when compared with the pre-hydralazine value (15.3 +/- 1.3 liters/minute versus 13.1 +/- 1.1 liters/minute; p less than 0.05). The improvement in PaO2 at rest continued relative to the pre-hydralazine value (70.9 +/- 3.2 mm Hg versus 65.1 +/- 3.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) as did the PaO2 during exercise (60.3 +/- 3.5 mm Hg versus 53.3 +/- 2.0 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). The reduction in PaCO2 at rest persisted compared with the pre-hydralazine value (41.2 +/- 2.4 mm Hg versus 47.0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) as did the PaCO2 during exercise (44.0 +/- 2.8 mm Hg versus 48.0 +/- 2.8 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). No significant changes in minute ventilation, PaO2, or PaCO2 were seen at rest or during exercise, when re-measured after six to 18 months in an age- and sex-matched control group of 10 patients who did not receive hydralazine. These results demonstrate that the short-term effects of hydralazine on ventilation and blood gas values persisted after six to 18 months of treatment in this sample of patients, some of whom received doses less than 200 mg per day.\r"

Since the sensitivity and specificity of clinical assessment of extracellular fluid volume status in hyponatremic states remain unknown, 58 non-edematous patients with serum sodium less than 130 meq/liter were prospectively evaluated. Patients were judged to be either normovolemic (no response of serum sodium to saline infusion) or hypovolemic (saline infusion significantly corrected hyponatremia). Hypovolemic patients had significantly higher plasma renin activity (5.0 +/- 1.5 versus 2.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml per three hours, p less than 0.05) and norepinephrine (1,054 +/- 252 versus 519 +/- 55 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) concentrations than did normovolemic patients. Clinical assessment correctly identified only 47 percent of hypovolemic patients and 48 percent of normovolemic patients. Thus, clinical assessment was of limited sensitivity and specificity in identifying extracellular fluid volume status in these hyponatremic patients. However, the concentration of sodium in a spot urine sample clearly separated hypovolemic (mean UNa = 18.4 +/- 3.1 meq/liter) from normovolemic (mean UNa = 72 +/- 3.7 meq/liter, p less than 0.001) hyponatremic patients.\r"

The most important and characteristic attributes of the interns as rated by patients were demonstrating personal concern, skill in treating disease, providing information about findings, preparation for impending events, availability, manner of communication, trust, and comforting and listening skills. Encouraging mutuality by the interns was not often done and was not believed to be particularly important by patients. Older patients and whites were more satisfied with their interns, whereas college-educated, employed, and male patients were less satisfied. Implications of the findings for understanding and teaching about the physician-patient relationship are discussed.\r"

Multiple stool examinations should be performed routinely for such patients. Examination of sputum for the parasite is recommended if pneumonia is present. Prompt diagnosis and therapy are essential for prevention of fatal dissemination.\r"

Autopsy examination at age 25 years revealed cystine storage in multiple tissues including the atrophic ovaries, pancreatic islet cells, the aorta, and the brain. Dysfunction of multiple organ systems may develop in patients with cystinosis who survive into adulthood. This emphasizes the need for a systemic therapy for cystinosis.\r"

One of these prolactinomas invaded both internal auditory canals and simultaneously grew inferiorly, reducing the bony support of the skull and necessitating the patient to utilize both hands to hold his head up. The second patient's prolactinoma invaded the sphenoidal, ethmoidal, and cavernous sinuses. Both of these patients had neurosurgical debulking of their tumors followed by radiation therapy. Neither patient's prolactin levels decreased significantly during their first five years post-surgically, at which time bromocriptine was added. Since then, there has been a gradual lowering of serum prolactin levels and a decrease in the size of these tumors. These cases demonstrate that prolonged treatment and very large doses of bromocriptine may be necessary for tumor reduction in patients with invasive prolactinomas.\r"

Infusion of 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 decreased uterine blood flow by 21% (p less than 0.001) and fetal arterial oxygen content by 15% (p less than 0.01), with no further increase in fetal cerebral blood flow. Maternal arterial pressure decreased and heart rate increased (p less than 0.001) without variation of arterial blood gases. Significant plasma levels of nifedipine were detected in the fetal and maternal circulations.

  ".W": "We compared the colposcopic and histologic features of 39 papillomavirus-related cervical lesions with their associated human papillomavirus type. Two thirds of the lesions contained human papillomavirus type 16-related deoxyribonucleic acid, and 69% of them were classified as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I or II, in contrast to 92% of lesions containing human papillomavirus 6/11 deoxyribonucleic acid. On histologic examination, low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplastic lesions tended to be sharply demarcated and have an uneven or granular surface contour. In contrast, high-grade lesions often had diffuse borders and were usually smooth in appearance. Both low- and high-grade lesions displayed variable degrees of whiteness, thickness, and papillomatous configurations. Patterns of coarse punctuation were more common in higher grade cervical intraepithelial neoplastic lesions and in those containing human papillomavirus 16. Predictably, the colposcopic features of lesions containing human papillomavirus 6/11 deoxyribonucleic acid sequences compared closely with those of low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. In contrast, human papillomavirus 16-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia exhibited a greater spectrum of colposcopic patterns, including those associated with condyloma and low- and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplastic lesions. We conclude that, although a portion of low- and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplastic lesions can be distinguished colposcopically, a significant number of lesions containing features of low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or condyloma contain human papillomavirus 16 deoxyribonucleic acid and cannot be distinguished from presumably innocuous human papillomavirus infections.\r"

The Limulus amebocyte lysate assay is the most sensitive test clinically available for the detection of endotoxin in biologic samples. The diagnostic value of the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay test for the detection of intra-amniotic infection has been examined and compared with that of the Gram stain. The Gram stain had a 60.8% sensitivity and 9.6% false positive rate. The Limulus amebocyte lysate assay had a 69% sensitivity and a 4.8% false positive rate. When both tests were used in combination, the sensitivity improved to 95.6%, whereas the false positive rate was 14.3%. The Limulus amebocyte lysate assay test is a rapid, sensitive, inexpensive, and simple test for the detection of gram-negative intra-amniotic infections.\r"

To define further fetal bromide exposure during pregnancy, we determined the cord serum bromide concentration in 1267 newborn babies born in Rochester, New York, during the 6-month period from January 1, 1984 to June 30, 1984. There was a normal distribution of the cord serum bromide concentration values (mean +/- SD = 8.6 +/- 2.6 mg/L; range 3.1 to 28.5 mg/L). The highest concentration was still significantly below the minimal bromide concentration associated with toxic effects (720 mg/L). There was no association between the cord serum bromide concentration and indices of fetal health including Apgar scores, presence of congenital malformations, and neonatal disposition. No mothers were taking significant amounts of bromide-containing drugs during pregnancy. The second highest cord serum bromide concentration (21.4 mg/L) was in a woman who was an amateur photographer and developed her own film, which required her to use chemicals containing bromide. Our results indicate that excessive fetal bromide exposure is rare and probably occurs only in the setting of maternal use of bromide-containing drugs or occupational exposure during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the origin, direction, and relevance of the umbilical cord twist. We initially hypothesized that the direction of the helix or twist of the human umbilical cord at birth correlated with the eventual handedness of the child. Among 2801 singleton placentas in this study, only 5% had no twist, and the left twist outnumbered the right twist by 7 to 1, a ratio that is strikingly similar to the predominance of right-handed persons to non-right-handed persons in the general population. Forty-five 3- and 4-year-old children with previously documented cord twists were evaluated with respect to hand preference and performance. The direction of the cord twist was independent of the handedness of the child as well as the mother. We have documented an increased incidence of absent twist and right twist in association with single umbilical artery, suggesting that the impetus for the cord twist is independent on hemodynamic forces in the umbilical cord itself. We further document an increased incidence of absent twist among intrauterine fetal deaths and twins, suggesting that decreased fetal movement can impede the forces leading to normal twisting of the umbilical cord. Absence of cord twist may be associated with adverse prognosis.\r"

Patients who by interpretation of the fetal heart rate tracing alone were diagnosed as having fetal distress demonstrated significantly lower pH (p = 0.001) and base excess (p less than 0.0001) in umbilical venous blood. Umbilical venous cord MB (p less than 0.05) and BB (p less than 0.01) were increased in this group. Abnormal fetal heart rate patterns correlate well with acid-base abnormalities and elevated creatinine phosphokinase values. These tests may demonstrate more efficient and improved indicators of tissue injury and damage from perinatal asphyxia than clinical observation alone.\r"

A notable number of babies who were born in a vigorous state were in fact acidotic (umbilical arterial pH greater than 1 SD below mean). Seventy-two percent of acidotic babies had an Apgar score greater than 7 at 1 minute, and 92% had an Apgar score greater than 7 at 5 minutes. Correlation coefficients of Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes and arterial pH with the health status of newborn infants were poor. A chi 2 analysis of arterial pH and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes indicated that a larger number of sick babies had an Apgar score less than 7 and acidosis than expected by pure chance. However, the sensitivity values of the Apgar score at 1 minute (0.48) and 5 minutes (0.24) and the arterial pH (0.40) for predicting sick children limit the clinical usefulness of these tests. While technically feasible in a community hospital, routine cord pH measurements add little to neonatal evaluation and management.\r"

The lesion's apparent rarity may be ascribed to limited awareness of the clinical appearance, combined with technical difficulty in obtaining suitable biopsy material for confirmation. A consequence of previous cervical trauma, endometriosis of the cervix can be expected to increase in incidence with more widespread use of invasive cervical procedures. Clinical recognition and tissue confirmation thus become essential. This paper refocuses attention on cervical endometriosis by documenting the clinical, colposcopic, and histopathologic findings in 16 cases seen at a single colposcopy clinic over a 6-month period. Diagnosis in these patients was facilitated and improved by fine needle aspiration cytologic testing. This technique, not previously used for documentation of endometriosis in this location, is outlined in detail, together with a full description and illustration of the cytologic features.\r"

The interval of testing is predicated on the concept that amniotic fluid volume diminishes slowly (unquantified) as a result of developing hypoxia. We present six postterm pregnancies in which amniotic fluid volume diminished abruptly over 24 hours. Although one fetus died, the three babies delivered by cesarean section and the two babies delivered after a 2-day labor did well, despite obvious postmaturity syndrome, meconium staining, and variable decelerations. Apgar scores in the survivors were above 8, and pH results failed to confirm hypoxia. These data suggest the need to better understand the mechanisms regulating amniotic fluid volume.\r"

Of the 12 surviving infants in group I (survival 28%), 11 were ventilated (median = 50 days), eight had moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and four had mild retrolental fibroplasia. At follow-up, two infants had physical disabilities with moderate to severe functional impairment, one had a minor disability, and nine had normal neurodevelopment. In contrast, of the 13 surviving infants in group II (survival 76%), nine were ventilated (median = 8 days), six had moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and six had mild RLF. At follow-up, one infant had a physical disability with moderate to severe functional impairment, four had minor disabilities, and eight had normal development. Perinatal factors that positively influenced survival in the two groups combined included active perinatal management, antenatal steroids, female sex, and absence of clinical chorioamnionitis and asphyxia. Although group I infants had a significantly higher mortality rate (p less than 0.05) and required a longer duration of ventilation (p less than 0.05), no differences in the incidence of postnatal complications or long-term morbidity at 2 to 4 years of age were evident between the two groups.\r"

Median concentrations of the two enzymes were significantly higher in women with mild preeclampsia (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase = 1.40, alanine aminopeptidase = 1.12 U/mmol creatinine) or severe preeclampsia (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase = 2.90, alanine aminopeptidase = 1.26 U/mmol creatinine). This increased enzyme excretion indicates subclinical preeclamptic renal tubular damage.\r"

The 628 white and 105 black women were followed up through June 1984 to determine survivorship. Race was evaluated as a prognostic factor with univariate, multivariate, and excess death rate analyses. Overall, an estimated 89.2% of whites and 61.6% of blacks survived 3 years from the time of diagnosis. Although black women tended to have more advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and a higher proportion of undifferentiated malignancies, the racial difference in survival persisted after adjustment for these factors. When initial therapy was considered, race remained a significant prognostic determinant among women who did not receive radiation therapy.\r"

Four of nine patients with invasive carcinoma were diagnosed at antepartum colposcopy, with an additional two patients recognized as having invasive cancer at the postpartum colposcopic examination. The omission of routine biopsy is less than ideal if only one antepartum colposcopy is performed, since a considerable period of time may elapse before the patient is seen again postpartum. Those situations in which it may be omitted, together with guidelines for the management of pregnant patients with abnormal cervical cytologic findings, are presented.\r"

This study evaluated both intraexercise and postexercise responses of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine in sedentary women and women runners with normal and abnormal menstruation. Five eumenorrheic nonrunners and five eumenorrheic, four oligomenorrheic, and five amenorrheic runners were evaluated on 2 consecutive days. On day 1, the women cycled on a bicycle ergometer against an increasing work load until exhaustion, and on day 2, the women underwent a submaximal exercise regimen. Serial blood draws were taken at specified time intervals during intraexercise and postexercise periods on both days. The data collected during exercise for all groups showed that epinephrine and norepinephrine had a sixfold to sevenfold rise on day 1 and had a threefold rise on day 2. Dopamine increased twofold during both exercise protocols. On day 1 norepinephrine displayed a significantly higher percentage change from baseline to peak levels for oligomenorrheic and amenorrheic runners than for eumenorrheic runners and sedentary women. This latter finding is consistent with the hypothesis that periodic marked elevations in norepinephrine levels during maximal exercise may interfere with pulsatile luteinizing hormone release and hence may play a role in the occurrence of menstrual dysfunction in women runners.\r"

On the other hand, no inhibitory effect was identified in supernatants from similar cultures of peritoneum and omentum, while supernatants of fallopian tubes showed slight suppressive activity. These results suggest the existence of soluble nonspecific immunosuppressive factor(s) released from human endometrium (especially during the secretory phase), and imply that these factor(s) may exert an important role in protecting the fertilized ovum from maternal rejection.\r"

Plasma concentrations of magnesium and zinc and the magnesium and zinc content of red blood cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured for 3 or 5 days per week during three menstrual cycles. The cycles were divided into four phases: menses, follicular, ovulatory, and luteal. Plasma magnesium concentrations were highest during menses and then gradually declined, reaching the lowest point during the ovulatory phase. This was followed by a rise during the luteal phase. Plasma zinc concentrations were higher during menses and the follicular phase and then dropped during the ovulatory and luteal phases. Both the magnesium and zinc content of red blood cells and mononuclear cells remained constant over the course of the study and did not change significantly as a function of cycle phase. This study provides evidence that plasma magnesium and zinc concentrations fluctuate during the menstrual cycle in a phase-related fashion in normally menstruating women. Whether these changes are hormonally mediated or reflect metabolic changes will require further study.\r"

No complications occurred in the triploid group, while five of 25 (20%) diploid cases with evaluable follow-up had nonfatal sequelae. Complications included persistent mole treated by recurettage and four cases requiring chemotherapy (human chorionic gonadotropin titer plateau, clinical metastasis, overt choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic tumor). A combined morphologic and genetic classification of partial moles is recommended for identification and risk assessment. Deoxyribonucleic acid cell cycle fractions of the diploid partial moles may be helpful in the identification of patients at high risk for complications. A proliferation index greater than 3.6 separated the cases with sequelae from most of the uncomplicated cases (sensitivity 100%, specificity 95%).\r"

No significant correlation was found between chlamydia infection and any of the parameters investigated in the wet smear. Results of swab test or history showed no discrimination between young women with cultures positive for C. trachomatis and those with cultures negative for C. trachomatis. Chlamydia was found in 32% of patients when the gynecologic examination showed signs of infection and in 10% when no signs of infection were seen (p less than 0.025). Thirteen of the 19 (70%) adolescents with chlamydia infections had no signs of infection. We conclude that neither swab test, vaginal wet smear, nor the history of the patient can give conclusive evidence of a chlamydial infection. Detection of C. trachomatis in this population can be done only by culture or other specific methods.\r"

In these studies, the derivative was found to be a specific competitive inhibitor of oxytocin-induced contractions of pregnant guinea pig uterus in vitro. In addition, its intravenous administration induced a dose-dependent inhibition of oxytocin-induced uterine contractions in situ. Finally, like ritodrine, the drug induced a dose-dependent delay of ongoing labor in rats. These results suggest that 1-deamino-[D-Tyr(Oethyl)2,Thr4,Orn8] vasotocin, unlike ritodrine, is a potent and specific antagonist of oxytocin-induced uterine contractions and thus may have potential clinical utility in the treatment of preterm labor.\r"

We induced acute fetal hypoxia by compressing the umbilical cord of the fetal rat with a microvascular clamp. Direct observation of fetal behavior immediately after cord compression identified a three-phase behavioral response to acute hypoxia, consisting of an initial suppression in motor activity, a brief period of hyperactivity, and a secondary suppression of movement. All three phases occurred in less than 2 minutes from the onset of hypoxia. The stereotypic hypoxic response of rat fetuses may be adaptive as a means of removing mechanical sources of umbilical cord compression. Among fetuses exposed to alcohol in utero, the response to hypoxia was diminished in intensity and duration. Because of their altered hypoxic response, alcohol-exposed fetuses may therefore be at greater risk from transient cord compression in utero.\r"

Lung fluid was collected through a catheter inserted into the fetal trachea. In six experiments, continuous saline solution infusion for 1 hour followed by equivolumnar norepinephrine (3.0 micrograms/min) for 1 hour via the fetal jugular vein was carried out. In three additional experiments (two fetuses), a 3.0 mg intravenous bolus of propranolol was administered before norepinephrine infusion. Saline solution infusion did not influence the lung fluid flow rate or fetal biophysical and biochemical parameters. Norepinephrine increased fetal blood pressure by 22% and decreased lung fluid flow by 45% from control values. Lung fluid flow rate recovered within 2 hours after the end of the norepinephrine infusion. Pretreatment with propranolol did not alter the results. In addition to previous reports that demonstrated beta-sympathomimetic agonist-enhanced reabsorption of lung fluid from fetal alveolar epithelial cells, our present results suggest that a reduction in fetal lung fluid secretion may be implemented as well through stimulation of alpha-sympathomimetic receptor sites in the pulmonary vasculature.\r"

Mesometrial electromyographic activity was present in all animals studied. Contracture activity was synchronous in both mesometrium and myometrium. The frequency distribution of electromyographic events of different duration in the mesometrium was qualitatively identical to that recorded from the myometrium. The frequency of events less than 180 seconds was greater in the myometrium, while no difference was observed in contracture frequency. Mean contracture duration in myometrium and mesometrium shortened as gestation progressed (p less than 0.01), and was of significantly shorter duration on the day of delivery when compared with all gestational age intervals (p less than 0.05). Except at 135 to 145 days' gestation and at the day of delivery, myometrial contractures were of significantly longer duration than mesometrial contractures. The presence of the endometrium and fetal membranes in the pregnant ewe may stimulate the myometrium, and account for the difference observed. In vivo recording of mesometrial electromyographic activity may provide an opportunity to study the paracrine regulation of myometrial activity.\r"

  ".W": "In this century, paramount progress has been made in many areas of medicine, not least in the field of contraception, with landmarks such as the introduction of intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs), hormonal contraceptives (OCs), and laparoscopic sterilization. The general optimism of the 1960s about overcoming the problems of global overpopulation with these new tools has subsequently been replaced by growing concern about the risks of contraception in general and of OCs especially. It was not before the 1980s that the benefit-risk balance of hormonal contraception turned out to be much more favorable than was formerly suspected. The wide variation from country to country in the prevalence of contraceptive methods has economic, political, religious, sociological, educational, and legal rather than medical reasons. Former misjudgments have led to a ban on valuable tools such as the sequential regimen or the use of 17-acetoxyprogestogen analogues as components in OCs, or to a ban on the licensing of depot progestogens in some countries but not in others. The recent decision of U.S. firms to cease production and sale of IUDs for legal reasons is unique and hopefully will not be imitated elsewhere. Just after the introduction of oral contraception, tremendous inventive dynamics led to the discovery of several new contraceptive principles. Most of these have reached the stage of clinical application and are being used satisfactorily, at least in some parts of the world. Later contraceptive concepts are still in the stage of experimentation and no breakthrough appears to be directly ahead. If contraception means more than just meeting individual wants--if it is also to be an instrument for handling the increasing problems of overpopulation--then much more must be done to deepen our knowledge of reproductive physiology, to popularize efficient means of contraception, and to make them available to everyone. Otherwise, all efforts to improve health standards throughout the world according to the \"WHO Global Strategy for Health for All by the Year 2000\" will be in vain.\r"

A detailed analysis of these data suggests, however, that such studies have serious methodologic flaws. For example, the clinical diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis may be incorrect up to 50% of the time, rendering statistical analysis meaningless. The known cardiovascular risks of cigarette smoking may be amplified by OC use, but nonsmokers probably do not have an increased risk. Further, a number of studies in developing-world countries do not yield evidence of increased cardiovascular risks of OC use. Abnormal levels of serum lipids appear to affect cardiovascular (that is, myocardial infarction) risks in Western populations. Whether normalization of these levels improves the outlook is not entirely certain. The hormonal components of OCs are known to affect serum lipids, raising concern about possible long-term consequences. Newer low-dose OC formulations (such as triphasics) do not cause changes in serum lipids and therefore eliminate this putative risk.\r"

The mean preoperative intraocular pressure was 19.3 mm Hg on an average of 2.3 glaucoma medications. Visual acuity improved in 58 eyes (77%) at two months, with an average improvement of 3.3 and 3.6 lines at two and 12 months, respectively. Of the 75 eyes, 49 (65%) achieved a visual acuity of 20/40 or better; three patients (4%) had further deterioration in vision at the completion of follow-up because of progressive glaucoma or macular disease. Postoperatively, the average intraocular pressure was 3.8 and 3.0 mm Hg lower than the preoperative level at two and 12 months (P less than .001) on 0.63 and 0.79 glaucoma medications, respectively. However, 27 (36%) of the 75 eyes had a recorded intraocular pressure greater than 30 mm Hg and 30 (40%) had a pressure 7 mm Hg or more above their preoperative level during the first six months after surgery. Despite improved long-term control of intraocular pressure, detectable conjunctival filtering blebs were present in only 31 (41%) of 75 eyes at two months and in seven (12%) of 56 eyes at 12 months. Hyphema occurred in 34 (45%) of the cases.\r"

Three to six convex leading fronts of migrating epithelial sheets developed along the circumference of the defect and progressed toward the center. Neighboring fronts met along their sides, resulting in the formation of various geometric shapes. In the final stage of the healing process a contact line shaped like a \"Y\" or two \"Y's\" placed with their long axes end to end was seen where the advancing fronts of migrating epithelial sheets met. The rate of healing of the abrasions was determined by measuring the area of the abrasions at daily intervals from serial photographs. The area of the epithelial defects decreased exponentially with time, indicating a constant rate of epithelial cell migration.\r"

We further calculated the displacement of the image of the illuminating element of the operating microscope on the retina of the simplified schematic eye and found that the \"coaxial\" operating microscope would focus the light between 1.3 and 1.8 mm superior to the fovea of the eye, depending on the theoretical refractive status of the simplified eye. Actual measurements on a simulated retina (35-mm camera) confirmed the calculated displacements. The deviation varied with eye tilt and microscope position. We also found that the maneuvers commonly used by anterior segment surgeons of tilting the microscope and rotating the eye downward tended to displace the image of the illuminating element closer to the fovea, increasing the chance for symptomatic retinal damage. A combination of such maneuvers may reduce the potential for clinically significant retinal phototoxicity by displacing the light further inferior to the fovea.\r"

Pentoxifylline, a methylxanthine, has previously been shown to augment PMN chemotaxis in vitro. The authors therefore investigated the effects of pentoxifylline on 1) in vitro PMN chemotaxis, 2) in vivo leukocyte accumulation, and 3) protection against Staphylococcus aureus infection in newborn mice. Using a modified Boyden chamber system, they demonstrated that pentoxifylline significantly enhanced neonatal PMN chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, pentoxifylline was found to increase PMN accumulation in vivo in a proteose peptone-induced peritonitis model. Finally, the survival rate in experimentally induced S aureus infection was 51% in neonatal mice given pentoxifylline, compared with 17% in a control (nonpentoxifylline) group (P less than 0.01). These data demonstrate pentoxifylline modulation of PMN migration and enhancement of host defense against bacterial infection.\r"

CIA mice administered 1 X 10(5) T101N hybridoma cells intravenously were observed to have reduced hind paw pathology scores as well as reduced edema, compared with CIA mice or CIA mice administered 1 X 10(5) cells of a control T-cell hybridoma, T104B1. The hind paw articular cartilage of joints from mice with CIA administered T101N cells resembled normal joint architecture in histologic staining and alignment of articular cartilage surfaces. The histopathology observed in joints of mice administered T104B1 hybridoma cells resembled that of CIA mice with large pannus formation, fibrous bridging of the joint, soft-tissue metaplasia, and joint disorganization. The data indicate that specific T-cell hybridoma cell lines can modulate the joint histopathology observed in CIA to resemble the joint architecture of noninflammatory joints.\r"

Macrophages, T lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells were identified within myocarditic lesions during the acute phase of the disease. Macrophages detected by anti-Mac-1 MAb were in focal areas within myocarditic lesions on Days 4-7 after inoculation. T lymphocytes were detected in myocarditic lesions on Days 4-10, with MAb to Thy-1 and Lyt-1 antigens showing diffuse reaction patterns, suggesting random distribution of these cells in lesions. Focal areas of reactivity were detected with MAbs to L3T4 and Lyt-2 antigens, suggesting clusters of helper and cytotoxic/suppressor T lymphocytes, respectively. NK cells were presumptively detected by asialo GM1 surface marker in lesions at all times.

  ".W": "The objective of this research was to identify potential mechanisms that might account for the greater susceptibility of neonatal rats (5 days old) as compared with weanling rats (25 days old) to viral-induced lung injury. Sites of viral replication, the sequential development of bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and systemic humoral immune responses were compared between neonatal and weanling rats from 2 to 17 days after being inoculated intranasally with parainfluenza Type 1 (Sendai) virus. In both neonatal and weanling rats, viral antigen was demonstrated by immunoperoxidase technique and viral nucleocapsids, and budding virions were demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy in bronchiolar ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells as early as 2 days after inoculation. Similar evidence of viral replication was also demonstrated in both ages of rats in alveolar Type I and Type II epithelial cells and in macrophages. Neither virus nor viral antigens was identified in endothelial cells or interstitial cells of interalveolar septa. Bronchiolitis was induced as early as 2 days after inoculation in both ages of rats and was characterized by necrosis, erosion, and hyperplasia of epithelial cells. Multifocal to locally extensive interstitial pneumonia centered on bronchioles, was characterized by alveolar epithelial cell damage and by infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes in alveolar septa and spaces and was observed as early as 2 days after inoculation in both age groups of rats. Interstitial pneumonia of maximal severity occurred in weanling rats at 5 days after inoculation, whereas maximal pneumonia of comparable severity occurred in neonatal rats at 8 days after inoculation. Epithelial repair and resolution of bronchiolitis and pneumonia were largely complete in both ages of rats by 17 days after inoculation. Virus was recovered from lung homogenates of neonatal and weanling rats as early as 2 days after inoculation. In weanling rats, infective virus could not be recovered from lung beyond 6 days after inoculation, whereas in neonatal rats virus could be recovered from lung as late as 10 days after inoculation. Viral persistence in neonatal rats was associated with a delayed onset of serum antibody to the virus, compared with weanling rats. The results indicate that the cellular sites of viral replication and the pattern of inflammatory reactions are closely comparable between neonatal and weanling rats inoculated with Sendai virus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The possibility of detecting lipid peroxidation histochemically was investigated in liver tissue in vivo, in conditions in which the process has been demonstrated by biochemical methods. The technique was based on the detection of aldehyde functions with the use of the Schiff's reagent. The study was carried out on bromobenzene-intoxicated mice, which generally exhibit levels of lipid peroxidation considerably higher than those observed in the case of other hepatotoxins. Liver sections from control animals were unstainable by the reagent, while sections from bromobenzene-poisoned mice showed a purple stain of various intensity, unhomogeneously distributed, sometimes with a mediolobular localization. Microphotometric measurements were performed at 565 nm by means of a computer-controlled microscope photometer. The ratios of Schiff-positive area relative to total section area, as well as the total extinctions referred to 100 sq mu of the sections, showed a high correlation with the corresponding hepatic contents of malonic dialdehyde, chosen as biochemical index of lipid peroxidation. In vitro studies in which liver sections were incubated in the presence of NADPH-Fe2+, showed a Schiff positivity which increased with the incubation time, confirming the reliability of the histochemical method. Another procedure, based on the use of 2-OH-3-naphtoic acid hydrazide coupled with fast blue B, was also developed and proved to be possibly more sensitive than Schiff's reagent in the detection of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of anti-Fx1A to Heymann nephritis antigens (HA) on rat glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) in culture leads to capping and disappearance of antigens from the cell surface. This process may contribute to the formation of glomerular subepithelial immune deposits in vivo. The authors differentially extracted GECs to determine whether HA redistribution is mediated by cytoskeletal components. Observations were made by phase-contrast and immunofluorescence microscopy on primary and passaged GECs in monolayer culture and by spectrofluorimetry on GECs in suspension. GEC-bound sheep anti-Fx1A IgG was detected by fluoresceinated anti-sheep IgG. Microfilaments were identified by rhodamine-phalloidin staining of F-actin. After cross-linking HA on GECs by anti-Fx1A IgG at 0 C, GECs remained polygonal in shape and had diffuse granular IgG staining of their plasma membranes. Treatment of GECs at 0 C with hypotonic buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 produced microfilament-rich cytoskeletons that retained the shape of unextracted GECs. Further incubation with DNase I at 37 C removed microfilaments (mean fluorescence declined by 90%) and resulted in the rounding of cytoskeletons. After Triton X-100 treatment, 85% of initial GEC-bound anti-Fx1A IgG remained, but only 29% remained after DNase I. In contrast to intact IgG, detergent-extraction resulted in the complete loss of GEC-bound anti-Fx1A Fab'. Anti-Fx1A IgG did not bind to GECs pretreated with Triton X-100. Thus, cross-linking of HA by anti-Fx1A converts HA from a detergent-soluble, membrane-associated form to an insoluble, cytoskeleton-bound form. Attachment of cross-linked HA to the cytoskeleton is mediated by microfilaments.\r"

  ".W": "For investigation of mechanisms whereby smoking might potentiate asbestos-related disease, guinea pigs were given 0.5 mg UICC amosite by intratracheal instillation. Half the animals were subsequently exposed to cigarette smoke. Animals were sacrificed at 1 day, 7 days, and 1 month after exposure. Lungs were lavaged and macrophages separated from the lavage fluid. Lung fiber concentration, numbers of fibers in macrophages, and fiber sizes from tissue (TFs), macrophages (MFs), and macrophage-free lavagate (FFs) were determined by electron microscopy. Smoke-exposed animals retained greater numbers of fibers in lung tissue by 1 month but had greater total numbers of fibers in macrophages at all time periods. In both smokers and nonsmokers, fibers in the three morphologic compartments had distinctly different lengths: the longest fibers were found associated with the lung tissue; the macrophages always contained the shortest fibers; and the macrophage-free lavagate had fibers of intermediate size. However, fiber widths and aspect ratios did not show the same clear separation by anatomic compartment, suggesting that in both smoking and nonsmoking animals length is the size parameter which is most important in determining fiber clearance. Smoking did not affect the lengths of MFs but did produce a progressive reduction in the lengths of FFs and TFs with time. These data indicate that smoking causes a marked increase in the number of fibers retained in the lung within macrophages and suggest that either macrophage removal via the mucociliary escalator or macrophage mobility is impaired by cigarette smoke. However, smoking does not change the sizes of fibers in macrophages and does not appear to depress phagocytic capacity. These observations imply that failure of macrophage clearance and subsequent re-release of fibers into the medium may at least partially explain the changes in fiber sizes and eventual increases in tissue fiber concentrations in smoke-exposed animals.\r"

Chronic PAN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by seven subcutaneous injections of puromycin aminonucleoside (20 mg/kg) over 10 weeks (Groups I and II). Group II rats also received enalapril 10 mg/kg/day in the drinking water throughout the study (12 weeks). Group III rats served as age-matched controls. Proteinuria was similar in Groups I and II (35.5 +/- 9.7 versus 29.1 +/- 4.1 mg protein/mg creatinine, mean +/- SEM, P greater than 0.05). Serum creatinine remained unchanged in Group I, but rose from 0.7 +/- 0.04 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dl (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.05) in Group II. FSH was 13.8% in Group I, 12.9% in Group II (P greater than 0.05), and 0.6% in Group III. There was no significant difference in glomerular lipid content and in immunofluorescence for rat albumin, fibrinogen, IgM, IgG, and C3 between Groups I and II. ACE activity was inhibited by 94% in serum, 83% in lungs, and 92% in kidneys; and blood pressure response to. Angiotensin I challenge was decreased by 50% in rats similarly treated with enalapril versus controls. In summary, proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis in this model are not affected by ACE inhibition.\r"

The aims of the treatment were both to correct compensatory habits that patients used to conceal or reduce leakage accidents and to give specific education and strengthening of pelvic floor muscles. All patients who completed the three-months treatment definitely improved and 7 were cured. Accordingly a marked reduction or absence of weekly incontinence episodes as well as a reduction of the daily frequency of micturition was observed. On vaginal palpation a clear-cut improvement of pubococcygeous muscle contractility was detectable. Urethral closure pressure profilometry showed significant improvement of functional urethral profile length at rest and of maximal urethral closure present both at rest and during maximal voluntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscles. Micturition cystourethrography, repeated in 15 patients at the end of the treatment, showed a clear-cut improvement of bladder neck suspension defects in all but 2 patients. Follow-up assessments showed that the clinical effects were long-lasting. Possible mechanisms of this re-educative technique are discussed.\r"

Further, maximal motor unit activation, the relationship between submaximal motor unit activation and subsequent force production, and frequency content of the EMG signal were not significantly altered following caffeine ingestion. These results indicate that although caffeine may be a potential ergogenic aid for some activities, its ingestion may not improve performance in activities requiring strength and/or short-term endurance.\r"

Habitual sugar consumption correlated only with duration of aggression against property in alleged responders. Double-blind crossover challenges with aspartame, saccharin, sucrose, and glucose produced no significant effect on aggression or observers' ratings of behavior. Lower actometer counts followed the trials of aspartame, but the difference was not apparent to observers. It is unlikely that sugar and aspartame are clinically significant causes of disruptive behavior.\r"

Caregivers were carefully trained and supervised. A total of 112 elderly inpatients were randomly assigned to placement in a nursing home or a foster care home. Patients and caregivers were interviewed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after placement. Community Care Program patients were more likely to maintain or improve ADL (activities of daily living) and mental status scores. They also had better nursing outcomes and were more likely to get out of the house than were nursing home patients. Nursing home patients had higher life satisfaction, and participated in more social and recreational activities. The Community Care Program was 17 per cent less costly than nursing home care. The results suggest that foster care may be a viable alternative for a segment of the nursing home population.\r"

  ".W": "Using United States vital statistical data we examined trends in infant deaths from Respiratory Distress Syndrome/Hyaline Membrane Disease (RDS/HMD) for 1969 to 1983, by race and age at death. In order to improve comparability of diagnosis across two revisions of the International Classification of Diseases, deaths from RDS/HMD were ascertained using both underlying and associated causes of death. These data document a 2 per cent per year increase in infant mortality attributed to RDS/HMD for all races during interval I (1969-73) followed by 9 per cent per year decreases during intervals II (1974-78) and III (1979-83). However, there was a marked difference between Whites and Blacks in these trends. In the White population, RDS/HMD infant mortality increased by 2.2 per cent per year in interval I but then decreased by 10.5 per cent per year in interval II and 8.9 per cent per year in interval III. Among Blacks, on the other hand, the initial increase in RDS/HMD mortality was steeper (5.2 per cent per year) and the subsequent decreases were less (6.3 per cent per year and 8.0 per cent per year). As a result, the Black-White ratio in infant mortality attributed to RDS/HMD increased from 1.32 in 1969-73, to 1.59 in 1974-78 and to 1.72 in 1979-83. The proportion of RDS/HMD deaths that occurred in the postneonatal period increased from 1.1 per cent in interval I to 3.6 per cent in interval II to 5.0 per cent in interval III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using the crude treatment categories of surgical/nonsurgical/untreated, Blacks were found to have received less aggressive therapy. They were more likely than Whites to be treated nonsurgically (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2-1.7) or have no cancer-directed therapy (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.3-2.3), even after adjusting by logistic regression for differences in age, stage, and histology. These treatment variables strongly affected five-year survival, after adjusting for age, stage, race, and histology. This finding of racial differences in survival-associated treatment patterns demonstrates the need to consider treatment variables in studies of race and cancer survival.\r"

The goals included a reduction in propoxyphene use with alcohol or other CNS depressants, reduced prescribing of refills, and cessation of prescribing for patients at risk of abuse and misuse (suicide). We conducted time-series analyses of nationwide propoxyphene use data 1974-83 and analyzed data on drug overdose death rates covering a combined population of about 83 million. Segmented regression methods were used to determine if the informational program was associated with changes in trends of prescribing or overdose deaths. Comparison drug series were analyzed to control for other secular trends in prescribing. Nationwide propoxyphene use during the warnings continued a pre-existing decline of about 8 per cent per year, but this decline halted after the warnings. The no-refill recommendation had no impact on refill rates. The risk of overdose death per propoxyphene prescription filled has remained about constant since 1979. Sharper declines in misuse of such drugs will require stronger, more sustained regulatory or educational measures.\r"

One hundred thirty-three deaths occurred to women employed in the retail trade industry; of these, 77 per cent resulted from homicide. Women workers in gasoline service stations, food-bakery-and-dairy stores, and eating-and-drinking places had especially high risks of homicide. Texas female heavy-truck drivers had the highest fatal-injury rate, with motor-vehicle-related injuries causing 89 per cent of their deaths. These results indicate that effective strategies to prevent fatal occupational injuries of Texas women will need to address the problems of workplace violence and the hazards posed by motor vehicles.\r"

Ligament tensions and joint displacements were measured at static, nondestructive valgus forces as well as low-rate destructive forces. After quantifying and establishing individual ligament contributions to valgus restraining function, knees were then braced with two different laterally applied preventive braces, the McDavid Knee Guard and the Omni Anderson Knee Stabler. The effects of lateral bracing were analyzed according to valgus force, joint line opening, and ligament tensions. Valgus applied forces, with or without braces, consistently produced medial collateral ligament (MCL) disruptions at ligament tensions surprisingly higher than the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and higher than or equal to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Although large joint displacements were necessary for complete ligament failure, bundle disruption in the MCL, ACL, and PCL was noted at much smaller joint openings. In Part I of this study, no significant protection could be documented with the two preventive braces used. Also, four potentially adverse effects were noted: MCL preload, center axis shift, premature joint line contact, and brace slippage.\r"

The results indicated that for low-rate dynamic valgus loading, neither brace provided significant protection against MCL injury. Also, four potentially adverse effects were noted. The goals in Part II were to: 1) determine the clinical significance of brace induced MCL preload; 2) define the functional character of an \"ideal\" brace; 3) design and validate a surrogate knee model for testing brace effectiveness; and 4) determine brace performance under impact loading using the surrogate knee and six commercially available brace types (manufactured by DonJoy, McDavid, Mueller, Omni Scientific, Stromgren-Scott, and Tru-Fit). Knee braces, modified to measure varus/valgus bending force, were used to determine MCL preload effects in 13 human volunteers. An anatomically correct surrogate knee model, instrumented to measure ligament/tendon tension and medial joint opening, was developed and validated using information from our previous cadaver studies and results of analyses on the effects of high strain rates (100% versus 1000% strain/sec) on MCL failure. Over 500 impact tests were performed on the surrogate knee in unbraced versus braced conditions. Tests were conducted for three impactor masses, two flexion angles, and free or constrained limb positions. Impact safety factors (ISF) were calculated for each test condition and brace type. An ISF of 1.50 (MCL load reduction of 30%) was considered significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Only two of the repairs were augmented with autogenous patellar tendon grafts. Five patients had complete knee dislocations, including tears of both cruciate ligaments. Nineteen patients had a concomitant extraarticular iliotibial band tenodesis. Twenty-seven knees (24 patients) were followed an average of 57.6 months postoperatively. Recreational skiing was resumed at 5.4 months on average, and in ski racing and pivot-requiring sports all but three patients resumed participation at an average of 9.1 months. In 78% of the knees there was pain-free function. Mild pain was reported in 19%, the majority of which (4/5) was related to vigorous activity. Of the total, only two knees were reported to have a sensation of giving way. On clinical examination 85% (23/27) had normal pivot shift examination with no evidence of abnormal motion. Four percent (1/27) had a 1+ test and 11% (3/27) had \"glides.\" Arthrometer measurements revealed an average of 7.76 mm anterior displacement with 20 pounds of force on the knee with an ACL repair as compared to 5.56 mm on the uninjured knee. The laxity measurements of knees with repaired ACLs fell within the range reported for uninjured knees in the normal population. Five patients had reinjuries to the ACL at an average time of 28 months postoperatively, with two of five undergoing rerepair. Only one patient had an iliotibial band tenodesis to supplement the original ACL repair.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mechanical parameters compared were force to tear, change in length to tear, site of failure, and energy absorbed by the muscle-tendon unit before failure. Paired comparisons were made between 1) muscles stimulated at 64 Hz (tetanic stimulation) and passive (no stimulation) muscles, 2) muscles stimulated at 16 Hz (wave-summated stimulation) and passive muscles, and 3) muscles stimulated at 64 Hz and at 16 Hz. Both tetanically stimulated and wave-summation contracted muscles required a greater force to tear (at 64 Hz, 12.86 N more, P less than 0.0004; and at 16 Hz, 17.79 N more, P less than 0.003) than their nonstimulated controls, while there was no statistical difference in failure force between muscles stimulated at 16 Hz and 64 Hz. The energy absorbed was statistically greater for the stimulated muscles than for the passive muscles in Groups 1 and 2 (at 64 Hz, 100% more, P less than 0.0003; and 16 Hz, 88% more, P less than 0.0002). In Group 3, the tetanically contracted muscle-tendon units absorbed 18% more energy than the wave-summated stimulated muscles (P less than 0.01). All muscles tore at the distal musculotendinous junction, and there was no difference in the length increase at tear between muscles in each group. These findings may lead to enhanced understanding of the mechanism and physiology of muscle strain injuries.\r"

Even though these defects may be the most important prognostic factors in assessing knee joint injury, they are usually not diagnosed until arthrotomy or arthroscopy. Once injuries to hyaline cartilage are found and/or treated, no technique exists to follow these over time. Plain radiographs, arthrograms, and even computed tomography fail to detail most hyaline cartilage defects. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate five fresh frozen cadaver limbs and 10 patients whose pathology was known from arthrotomy or arthroscopic examination. Using a 0.35 Tesla superconducting magnet and spin-echo imaging technique with a head coil, we found that intraarticular fluid or air helped to delineate hyaline cartilage pathology. The multiplane capability of MRI proved to be excellent in detailing small (3 mm or more) defects on the femoral condyles and patellar surface. Cruciate ligaments were best visualized on sagittal oblique projections while meniscal pathology was best seen on true sagittal and coronal projections. MRI shows great promise in providing a noninvasive technique of evaluating hyaline cartilage defects, their response to treatment, and detailed anatomical information about cruciate ligaments and menisci.\r"

In the first five dogs, the ACLs of both knees were reconstructed using the medial one-third of the patellar tendon. The graft was fixed under a tension of 1 N (0.22 pounds) in one knee and 39 N (8.8 pounds) in the opposite knee. In the remainder of the dogs, the reconstructions were augmented with Dacron prostheses. Tensioning of both graft components in the augmented reconstructions was either with 1 N in one knee and 39 N in the contralateral knee or disproportionate tensions of 1 N and 39 N applied to the autogenous material and to the prosthesis. Sacrifice was 3 months postsurgery and results were examined with microangiography/history and mechanical testing. In the reconstructions with the patellar tendon alone, the biologic study showed poor vascularity and focal myxoid degeneration within the graft pretensioned with a load of 39 N. In the augmented reconstructions, the knees in which both graft materials were fixed with 1 N tension showed the strongest and stiffest reconstruction at 3 months. The study suggests that minimal tension should be applied to the graft materials during surgical reconstruction of the ACL.\r"

While four of these studies found a reduction in MCL injuries associated with using a brace, two of them reported increases.

Concentric work was done almost exclusively. KinCom analysis showed significant strength gain in this group (P less than 0.05), while an age, sex, and activity matched control group did not gain strength. Safety was evaluated by injury surveillance, blood pressure and heart rate monitoring, scintigraphy, and creatine phosphokinase measurement. Effects on growth and development, flexibility, and motor performance were also investigated, as these are factors with an impact on sports injury occurrence. Results showed that in the short term, supervised concentric strength training results in a low injury rate and does not adversely affect bone, muscle, or epiphyses; nor does it adversely affect growth, development, flexibility, or motor performance. As the safety question is multifaceted, this should not lead to the conclusion that strength training for prepubescents is uniformly safe. Further research is needed.\r"

Although its etiology remains unknown, studies have revealed differential changes in the bone mineral densities of postmenopausal women, anorexic women, and amenorrheic female athletes. Correlations have also been made between estrogen deficiency and osteoporosis in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. In order to examine the possibility of osteopenia, a group of 36 female runners between the ages of 15 and 44 years were evaluated for bone mineral density, menstrual function, and dietary habits. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were also determined for each participant, as were complete blood counts. Using dual photon absorptiometry, all participants underwent a 20 minute scan of the lumbar spine with specificity to the L1-14 vertebrae. The 36 subjects included 19 oligomenorrheic and 17 eumenorrheic women. Results of bone density analyses revealed that the oligomenorrheic runners had significantly lower calibrated bone mineral density (CBMD) than their eumenorrheic counterparts (P less than or equal to 0.01). Likewise, the PTH levels of the oligomenorrheic runners were also significantly lower (P less than or equal to 0.01). Analysis of dietary logs revealed no significant differences between the dietary habits, the calcium intake, or the caloric intake of the two groups. The data from this study indicate that there is a relationship between reduced serum PTH levels and the oligomenorrheic state. The loss of the protective effect of estrogen in the oligomenorrheic runners possibly contributed to their reduced bone mineral densities and could be a contributing factor in osteopenia.\r"

Further, no data exist to describe the physiologic changes or potential risk associated with using hand-held weights during aerobic dance. The purpose of this study was to determine the changes in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and body composition following 8 weeks of aerobic dance using hand-held weights (Heavyhands, AMF, Jefferson, IA). Twenty-eight college females volunteered for the study. All subjects were given a preoxygen and postoxygen uptake (VO2 max) treadmill test. Body composition was measured by taking the sum of five skinfold sites and determining the percent change following training. Subjects were randomly assigned to a hand-held weight or nonhand-held weight group. No significant differences (P less than 0.05) existed between groups for VO2 max and body composition after 8 weeks of training. However, a significant improvement (P less than 0.05) in VO2 max was found within the hand-held weight (37.7 to 42.6) and in the nonhand-held weight group (36.5 to 41.9). Complaints from subjects included transient aches and pains in the shoulder area during the first 3 weeks as a result of hand-held weight use. These findings suggest that hand-held weights may be used safely but do not increase the work load sufficiently above that of aerobic dance alone to significantly modify VO2 max or body composition.\r"

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy was used in place of open breast biopsy for definitive operation in breast cancer. Our experience with 2,623 aspiration biopsies over a 3 year period has been reviewed. There was a total of 323 cancers, of which 257 (80 percent) were unequivocally diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Definitive operation was performed in 244 of these patients (95 percent) without open biopsy. Thirteen had an excisional biopsy before definitive operation at the request of the referring physician. The sensitivity was 80 percent and the specificity was 98 percent. There were no false-positive diagnoses. The positive predictive value was 100 percent. False-negative diagnoses were made in 9 percent of the patients, half of whom had nonpalpable carcinomas. Our experience shows that fine-needle aspiration biopsy is accurate in the diagnosis of breast cancer, and when the finding is positive, it can be used for definitive breast operation, eliminating the need for open biopsy. A management algorithm has also been presented herein.\r"

Simple wound closure in this setting is sufficient to prevent incisional wound infections.\r"

Fifty patients (Group B) presented with a first episode of acute alcoholic pancreatitis. An amylase profile, consisting of initial and final values and the daily rate of change, was significantly different between the two groups. The initial serum amylase value was higher in Group A patients and decreased more rapidly to a lower value than in Group B patients. We conclude that both the initial value and pattern of serum amylase decay distinguish the hyperamylasemia of biliary tract disease from that of alcoholic pancreatitis.\r"

Preservation of the pancreaticoduodenal vessels and duodenum provides an excellent method of testing various operative techniques in pancreatic surgery which may lead to further clinical applications. The present study has compared the conventional noncontact Nd:YAG laser technique with electrocautery and a new contact Nd:YAG laser technique for proximal pancreatectomy. There were five dogs in each group, and the pancreatic duct was left open to drain into the abdominal cavity after pancreatic transection in all of the animals. Resection with the contact laser caused significantly less blood loss (109 +/- 74 ml) than the noncontact laser (228 +/- 81 ml), (p less than 0.05). A greater number of ligatures were used in the noncontact laser group (11 +/- 3 ligatures) as compared with the electrocautery group (2.2 +/- 1.6 ligatures) and the contact laser group (5.2 +/- 2.8 ligatures), (p less than 0.005). Noncontact laser and electrocautery resection techniques resulted in necrotizing pancreatitis and death in two animals. The new contact laser system provides a safe and effective method of performing pancreatic surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Major rectal operation, that is, abdominoperineal or anterior resection, for cancer frequently damages the autonomic pelvic nerve supply with resultant sexual dysfunction. The anatomic characteristics and function of the autonomic nervous system in the pelvis has been reviewed. Sexual function after rectal excision for cancer was studied in 25 male patients who were less than 60 years of age and exhibited normal sexual activity preoperatively. Of nine patients who had abdominoperineal resection, four were impotent and two reported no ejaculation with normal potency postoperatively. Of 4 patients who had high anterior resection, only 1 reported no ejaculation, whereas of 12 patients with low anterior resection, 4 were impotent and 3 reported no ejaculation. A higher incidence of sexual dysfunction was noted after abdominoperineal resection compared with after anterior resection (66 percent and 50 percent, respectively). However, the incidence after low and very low anterior resection was comparable with that after abdominoperineal resection (58 percent and 66 percent, respectively). Advanced patient age and very low resection were the two main factors effecting sexual dysfunction after major rectal operation. Although we believe that careful operative technique might reduce the incidence of sexual disturbances attributable to sympathetic fiber damage, avoidance of parasympathetic damage during operation cannot be accomplished because the most likely site of injury, namely the periprostatic plexus, is usually within the operative field, the exception being cases in which the tumor is small, thus allowing preservation of the rectoprostatic fascia.\r"

Nineteen patients died from unrelated causes. One hundred of 103 surviving patients (97 percent) were asymptomatic, whereas 3 had complaints. Acute cholecystitis did not occur in 91 patients without gallstones, whereas it did occur in 5 of 31 patients (16 percent) with gallstones (25 patients) or nonvisualization of the gallbladder (6 patients). Two patients in the former subgroup had formation of new gallstones. We conclude that cholecystectomy should be advocated whenever possible in patients with gallstones or nonvisualization of the gallbladder after endoscopic sphincterotomy due to the high incidence of acute cholecystitis in this subgroup and that operation is not necessary in patients without gallstones; however, one should be aware of possible formation of new stones in the gallbladder.\r"

Eleven patients with early gastric cancer seen over a 10 year period have been reviewed for clinical and pathologic features, method of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. The symptoms usually consisted of vague epigastric pain or dyspepsia, but anorexia, weight loss, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia were not commonly seen. Barium meal examination was not helpful in the diagnosis in 50 percent of the patients. The diagnosis was made by endoscopic biopsy of abnormal areas of the stomach, although in 6 of 11 patients, there was no macroscopic suspicion of malignancy. All patients were treated by surgical resection. The tumor was confined to the mucosa in five patients and had infiltrated the submucosa in six patients. The lymph nodes were free of tumor in every patient. At last follow-up, seven patients had survived more than 5 years after operation and were well, although recurrent tumors developed in two patients 3 and 4 years postoperatively but were detected early by endoscopic surveillance. Early gastric cancer has a good prognosis after surgical resection, but the symptoms are vague and the diagnostic tests can be misleading. A vigorous approach to investigation, treatment, and follow-up is necessary to achieve satisfactory results.\r"

Ninety percent of the organisms were sensitive to penicillin and 98 percent to first-generation cephalosporins. Blood culture specimens, obtained at admission, were negative in 15 patients. All patients responded well to operative debridement, excision of involved veins, and local wound care. Surgical debridement is the mainstay of therapy. We believe that intravenous antibiotic therapy with a first-generation cephalosporin should be used in the acute phase for control of surrounding cellulitis and prevention of bacteremia.\r"

These included five vagal nerve injuries causing ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis and hoarseness, four injuries of the marginal mandibular nerve, and three injuries of the hypoglossal nerve. Evidence of nerve dysfunction was not present preoperatively. None of the patients with nerve injury sustained a stroke as a result of carotid operation. Vocal cord paralysis was documented by indirect laryngoscopy. The incidence of cranial nerve injury during carotid endarterectomy appears to be higher than expected, particularly if asymptomatic patients are investigated; however, most injuries are transient and result not from transection but from trauma during dissection, retraction, and clamping of the vessels. The pertinent anatomy and techniques for preventing these injuries have been reviewed.\r"

Administration of vecuronium during steady state anaesthesia was associated with a significant decrease. Vecuronium produced a small reduction in pressure during a normal sequence induction, following a significant reduction after thiopentone. Tracheal intubation during normal sequence and rapid sequence inductions produced increases in pressure above the pre-intubation value (significantly so in the case of normal sequence induction); however, the intra-ocular pressure always remained below the pre-induction value, which suggests that vecuronium 0.15 mg/kg is a suitable relaxant as part of a rapid sequence induction technique where the use of suxamethonium is contraindicated.\r"

In ten noninfarcted hearts, halothane reduced regional differences in repolarization by decreasing action potential duration (APD90, mean +/- SE) in proximal fibers from 300 +/- 7 to 277 +/- 6 msec (P less than or equal to 0.01) without decreasing APD90 in distal fibers (control 240 +/- 4 msec, halothane 249 +/- 5 msec). In ten infarcted hearts, halothane accentuated pathologic differences in repolarization by decreasing APD90 in the non-ischemic proximal fibers from 311 +/- 8 to 287 +/- 7 msec (P less than or equal to 0.01), while increasing APD90 in the ischemic distal fibers from 375 +/- 15 to 406 +/- 18 msec (P less than or equal to 0.01). Halothane also decreased the overshoot from 32.9 +/- 1.0 to 28.4 +/- 0.8 m V (P less than or equal to 0.01) and Vmax from 356 +/- 28 to 300 +/- 22 V/s (P less than or equal to 0.05) in ischemic fibers. In seven infarcts evaluated by extrastimulus techniques, halothane slowed the conduction of premature impulses and prolonged refractoriness, while, in five of the seven hearts, it reversibly increased the range of coupling intervals which induced probable reentrant responses. In a separate study of seven infarcts, halothane decreased the rate of spontaneous activity originating in the ischemic region. It is concluded that halothane facilitates the occurrence of re-entry while inhibiting the initiation of abnormal impulses in the in vitro canine infarction model.\r"

The administration of verapamil resulted in no change in heart rate or blood pressure, but left ventricular stroke work, peak power, LV dP/dt max, and aortic blood acceleration were significantly reduced, while coronary blood flow remained unchanged. End-diastolic length increased in territory supplied by both left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LC) artery, but a significant decrease in systolic shortening occurred in the LAD segment only. Dyssynchrony of wall motion, characterized by post-systolic shortening, accompanied in three animals by a small amount of systolic lengthening, appeared with the administration of verapamil and was more pronounced in the LAD segment. Such patterns of wall motion have usually been attributed to myocardial ischemia. In the absence of significant reduction in coronary blood flow, and in the presence of a delay in onset of shortening and lengthening, these patterns of wall motion are more likely to reflect dyssynchrony of regional function than ischemia.\r"

In isolated, paced, Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, halothane (1.5 vol %) dissolved in the coronary perfusate produced a 48 +/- 2% decrease (P less than 0.01) in left ventricular developed pressure. In contrast, halothane administration had no significant effect on myocardial intracellular pH (7.18 +/- 0.04 at control vs 7.21 +/- 0.02 during halothane). Halothane exposure decreased (P less than 0.01) the forward rate constant of the creatine kinase reaction by 32 +/- 6%, as measured using saturation transfer NMR, suggesting a decline in the rate of high-energy phosphate metabolism. This was further indicated by a concomitant decrease (P less than 0.05) in myocardial oxygen consumption (20 +/- 5%). During the halothane-induced reduction in left ventricular developed pressure, only small decreases in the myocardial steady state concentrations of phosphocreatine (7 +/- 1%; P less than 0.01) and beta ATP (12 +/- 4%; P less than 0.05), and an increase in Pi (18 +/- 6%; P less than 0.05) were observed. However, similar changes in steady-state high-energy phosphate metabolites were also measured in time-control hearts not exposed to halothane. These results indicate that the negative inotropic action of halothane is not mediated by myocardial intracellular acidosis. Moreover, these findings do not support the concept that the negative inotropic action of halothane is the result of a reduction in myocardial high-energy phosphates.\r"

Cirrhosis was produced by gavaging enzyme-induced male Wistar rats with carbon tetrachloride in corn oil once weekly for 12 weeks. Control rats received corn oil only. After a 3-week period without treatment, blood and urine were collected from each rat for determination of background levels of inorganic fluoride, bromide, and trifluoroacetic acid (halothane metabolites) and for assessment of liver function. Rats were then anesthetized with 1.05% halothane in 50% oxygen for 3 h. Following anesthesia, serial blood and urine samples were taken to monitor halothane metabolism and liver function. No differences were observed between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic rats in serum levels and urinary excretion of halothane metabolites. However, serum levels of SGOT and SGPT were significantly increased about 1.5-fold in the noncirrhotic group and about 2.5-fold in the cirrhotic group after anesthesia. The increased levels observed in the cirrhotic group were significantly greater than in the noncirrhotic group. The results imply that the exacerbation of liver dysfunction after halothane anesthesia is most likely related to an indirect effect, such as change in liver blood flow, rather than to toxic metabolites.\r"

  ".W": "Some coronary vasodilators, paradoxically, may endanger patients with coronary artery disease by causing \"coronary steal.\" To determine the capacity of isoflurane and halothane to cause coronary steal, the authors studied their effects on coronary vascular resistance (CVR), diastolic coronary artery pressure, and collateral myocardial blood flow. Using ameroid constrictors, chronic occlusions of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery were created in ten dogs. Six to eight weeks after implantation, the dogs were anesthetized with fentanyl and pentobarbital, and a stenosis was created on the circumflex (Cx) coronary artery. Isoflurane and halothane were each administered in doses of 0.5 and 1.5 MAC. Diastolic aortic pressure was held constant. Using small catheters in the circumflex and LAD coronary arteries, the authors measured diastolic coronary artery pressures. Collateral myocardial blood flow was measured by the microsphere method. In this model, halothane and isoflurane minimally affect CVR. The maximum change in CVR, which was found during 1.5 MAC isoflurane, was -8% (not significant). Diastolic coronary pressures distal to the Cx stenosis (54.5 +/- 11.5 mmHg) and distal to the LAD occlusion (44.5 +/- 5.2 mmHg) did not change significantly with either isoflurane or halothane. Transmural collateral blood flow distal to the LAD occlusion (0.51 +/- 0.11 cc.g-1.min-1) was unaltered by either drug. There was no evidence of coronary steal. Epicardial ECG S-T segments showed no evidence of ischemia. The finding of minimal direct effects of halothane and isoflurane on CVR, diastolic coronary pressure, and collateral myocardial blood flow suggest that, under the conditions of this study, neither agent, when used as an adjuvant to high-dose narcotic anesthesia, is likely to cause myocardial ischemia by a coronary \"steal\" mechanism.\r"

Six mongrel dogs were monitored with arterial, central venous, and pulmonary artery flow-directed catheters. Measured end-tidal halothane assured a constant depth of anesthesia, while controlled ventilation and arterial blood gas analysis provided constant acid-base status. Each dog received sodium citrate (USP Fenwal) equivalent to fresh frozen plasma, 1.0 ml.kg-1.min-1, during both deep (D) and light (L) halothane anesthesia. Three dogs received the infusion during L halothane anesthesia first; after a 1-h stabilization period (2.5 h after first infusion) they received a second equivalent infusion during D halothane anesthesia. Three other dogs were studied first with D, then with L halothane. Mean expired halothane (+/- SEM) for group D was 1.52 +/- 0.08%, for group L, 0.85 +/- 0.07%. Significantly greater adverse cardiovascular effects were seen during D halothane anesthesia; four of the six dogs that received citrate during D halothane anesthesia required cessation of the infusion or suffered cardiac arrest. All six infusions during L halothane anesthesia were tolerated. In both groups, significant reductions in ionized calcium [Ca++] (P less than 0.0001) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (P less than 0.005) were observed; greater reductions in both parameters occurred in group D (P less than 0.0036-0.0005). In group D, but not in group L, cardiac output was depressed compared to baseline (P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors established a clinically practical definition of outcome, and used it to assess the effect of feedback of information about complications and the effect of pulse oximetry on the rate and severity of important anesthesia-related problems encountered in the operating room (OR) and recovery room (RR). On admission to the RR, the patient's anesthetist documented Recovery-Room-Impact Events (RRIE), defined as an \"unanticipated, undesirable, possibly anesthesia-related effect that required intervention, was pertinent to recovery-room care, and did or could cause at least moderate morbidity.\" Following a control period with no feedback of data, intense feedback of grouped (anonymous) RRIE rates was provided. Later, pulse oximeters were introduced to all anesthetizing locations. Among 12,088 patients (71% of all RR admissions), 18% had at least one RRIE in the OR or RR. The most common RRIEs were hypotension (4.4%), arrhythmia (3.9%), hypertension (1.5%), intubation difficulties (0.8%), hypoventilation (0.8%), and hypovolemia (0.6%). Feedback of information produced no demonstrable change in the rate of RRIEs. Although significantly fewer patients experienced RRIEs (15.6% vs. 12.4%, P less than 0.0001), hypotensive RRIEs (5.2% vs. 3.8%, P = 0.0003), and hypovolemic RRIEs (0.88% vs. 0.42%, P = 0.0017) following the introduction of pulse oximetry in the OR, confounding factors prevent establishment of a cause-and-effect relationship. Quality assurance may require more direct intervention and individual feedback to be effective. Still, the RRIE measure requires minimal effort at low cost and encourages improved transmission of information at the time of admission to recovery-room care.\r"

  ".W": "Surface electromyograms were recorded from the scalene, sternomastoid, and parasternal intercostal muscles in 16 supine premedicated adult patients before, during, and after the induction of anesthesia with thiopental and after the administration of succinylcholine. Muscle activity was measured as the rectified, integrated signal, and expressed as a percentage of the activity detected during a maximal inspiration. Activity was found in the scalene and sternomastoid muscles of all patients, and in the intercostal muscles of 13. This activity was more commonly tonic, and, at end-expiration, it was 7%, 6%, and 5% of the activity that could be generated by a maximal inspiration, for the scalene, sternomastoid, and intercostal muscles, respectively. In all subjects, this activity was markedly reduced or abolished by the administration of thiopental, to 0.7%, 0.6%, and 0.6%, respectively. There was no tonic activity in these muscles during spontaneous respiration after induction of anesthesia. It is suggested that the reduction of tonic inspiratory activity in these muscles may contribute to the reduction in functional residual capacity associated with anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to determine changes in hepatic oxygen supply in guinea pigs during halothane or isoflurane anesthesia. Twenty-seven guinea pigs were randomly divided into three equal groups: control (no anesthesia) group, and animals anesthetized with halothane or isoflurane to decrease mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 50%. Hepatic arterial blood flow (HABF) and portal blood flow (PBF), as well as arterial and portal venous blood oxygen content, were determined in awake animals (stage I, baseline values), and during anesthesia (stage II). HABF was found to be extremely low (0.04 ml.min-1.g-1) during both stages of observation in the control (no anesthesia) group, as well as during stage I (awake) in animals treated with halothane or isoflurane. Equal degrees of arterial hypotension during halothane and isoflurane anesthesia were accompanied by decreased HABF during halothane (37%), but no significant change in HABF during isoflurane anesthesia. PBF decreased significantly in both experimental groups; however, the decrease was more prominent during halothane than during isoflurane anesthesia (57% vs. 23%). The observed hepatic circulatory changes led to a 65% decrease in hepatic oxygen delivery during halothane, but only a 34% decrease during isoflurane anesthesia. The present study does not exclude the possibility that liver damage in the guinea pig model is related to the reductive metabolism of halothane or any other mechanism. However, the extremely low HABF and a prominent reduction in both HABF and PBF during halothane anesthesia may be responsible for hepatic damage observed in the guinea pig model.\r"

  ".W": "A \"specific bradycardic agent\" has direct negative chronotropic actions without producing other systemic or coronary hemodynamic alterations. UL-FS 49, a recently synthesized structural analog of verapamil without classical slow channel calcium blocking activity, is proposed as such an agent. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the hemodynamic and electrocardiographic actions of UL-FS 49 (0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 mg/kg) and compare its effects with those of propranolol (0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 mg/kg) in conscious or isoflurane-anesthetized (with and without neuromuscular blockade by pancuronium) chronically instrumented dogs. In six groups, comprising 52 experiments, UL-FS 49 was found to be more efficacious than propranolol in reducing heart rate, although this agent did not block the hemodynamic response to isoproterenol. UL-FS 49 produced 45-50% reductions in heart rate in dogs with isoflurane-induced tachycardia as compared to 15 and 30% reductions following propranolol. Furthermore, few other hemodynamic alterations were produced by UL-FS 49 indicating the remarkable specificity of this drug for reducing heart rate. A \"specific bradycardic agent\" such as UL-FS 49 may be useful clinically during the perioperative period. Such a drug may be especially advantageous for patients with documented or suspected ischemic heart disease, those who cannot tolerate the side effects of beta adrenergic blockade, as well as patients requiring a greater reduction in heart rate than can be obtained with beta adrenergic receptor antagonists.\r"

By high-performance liquid chromatography, using acidified methanol as the mobile phase and silica support, it was separated into its three geometrical isomer groups, cis-cis, cis-trans, and trans-trans, which contain three, four, and three isomers, respectively. The clinically available form of atracurium was made up of 58% cis-cis, 36% cis-trans, and 6% trans-trans isomers. In buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 37 degrees C, the half-lives of the three isomer groups were 57.1 +/- 0.9, 59.7 +/- 0.9, and 66.4 +/- 2.7 min, respectively, for the cis-cis, cis-trans, and trans-trans groups. In whole blood, under similar conditions, the three groups showed different behavior. The cis-cis group broke down in a monoexponential manner with a half-life of 23.3 +/- 2.8 min. The cis-trans group showed bi-exponential breakdown with a rapid phase of 2.3 +/- 0.4 min and a slow phase of 22.1 +/- 2.9 min. The trans-trans group decayed rapidly, but, because of the low concentration of this group in the mixture, kinetic parameters could not be obtained. In eight patients, the mean elimination half-life and apparent clearance of the cis-cis group were 20.6 +/- 1.5 min and 5.3 +/- 0.4 ml.kg-1.min-1, respectively. For the cis-trans group, the apparent elimination half-life and clearance were 17.7 +/- 1.8 min and 9.0 +/- 1.0 ml.kg-1.min-1, but these figures require care in interpretation, as this isomer group contains isomers of widely varying rates of decomposition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to measure the margin of safety in positioning three modern double-lumen tubes (Mallinkrodt [Broncho-Cath], Rusch [Endobronchial tubes], and Sheridan [Broncho-Trach]). The margin of safety in positioning a: 1) left-sided double-lumen tube (all manufacturers) is the length of the left mainstem bronchus minus the length from the proximal margin of the left cuff to left lumen tip; 2) Mallinkrodt right-sided double-lumen tube is the length of the right mainstem bronchus minus the length of the right cuff; and 3) Rusch right-sided double-lumen tube is the length of the right upper lobe ventilation slot minus the diameter of the right upper lobe. The length of the right and left mainstem bronchi were measured by in vivo fiberoptic bronchoscopy (n = 69), in fresh cadavers (n = 42), and in lung casts (n = 55), and the diameter of the right upper lobe bronchus was measured in lung casts (n = 55). The average +/- SD male left and right mainstem bronchial lengths were 49 +/- 8 and 19 +/- 6 mm, respectively, the average +/- SD female left and right mainstem bronchial lengths were 44 +/- 7 and 15 +/- 5 mm, respectively, the average right upper lobe bronchial diameter was 11 mm, the proximal left cuff to left lumen tip distance was 30 mm, the length of the Mallinkrodt right cuff was 10 mm, and the length of the Rusch right upper lobe ventilation slot was 15 mm. The average margin of safety in positioning left-sided double-lumen tubes ranged 16-19 mm for the different manufacturers. The average margin of safety in positioning Mallinkrodt right-sided double-lumen tubes was 8 mm, and the margin of safety in positioning Rusch right-sided double-lumen tubes ranged 1-4 mm, depending on French size. The authors concluded that left-sided double-lumen tubes are much preferable to right-sided double-lumen tubes because they have a much greater positioning margin of safety, and that proper confirmation of proper position of either a left- or right-sided double-lumen tube should be aided by fiberoptic bronchoscopy, because the absolute distances that constitute the margin of safety are extremely small.\r"

Shunts were prepared by anastomosing the pulmonary artery to the left atrial appendage to achieve arterial oxygen saturation of 65-75%. Catheters were implanted both in the right atrium for drug infusion and in the ascending aorta for blood sampling. Lidocaine, 1 mg/kg, injected as a rapid bolus, or 12 mg/kg, injected as a continuous infusion over 15 min, was delivered into the right atrium. Serial samples of arterial blood were obtained every 2.5 s for 1 min following the bolus injection and up to 4 h following the continuous infusion. Samples were analyzed for lidocaine by gas chromatography. Peak arterial whole blood concentration of lidocaine in the shunted animals was 37.0 +/- 2.1 micrograms/ml compared to 21.1 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml in the control animals; P less than .01. The peak arterial concentrations during the lidocaine infusion were 12.6 +/- 3.5 micrograms/ml in the RLS and 5.8 +/- 1.5 micrograms/ml in the controls. Total body clearance of lidocaine was decreased in the shunted animals to 30.7 +/- 13.2 ml.kg-1.min-1 from 68.1 +/- 12.1 ml.kg-1.min-1 in the control animals; P less than .001. The steady-state volume of distribution was also decreased in the shunted animals, 1.0 +/- 0.2 l/kg versus 2.0 +/- 0.7 l/kg in the controls; P less than .02. To induce convulsions 4.75 +/- 0.46 mg/kg of lidocaine was required in the shunted animals and 7.37 +/- 0.44 mg/kg in the control animals (P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Occasionally, opisthotonus also occurred transiently on emergence from isoflurane anesthesia. The incidence of opisthotonus upon anesthetic induction varied with the strain of mice studied, and was particularly high (nearly 80%) in the ddN and YBR/Ki strains. A significantly lower incidence of opisthotonus was observed in all 14 strains studied when 2.0% enflurane was used. One percent halothane did not produce opisthotonus in any strain of mice except one animal of the YBR/Ki strain, and, in this situation, it occurred only on emergence. These results suggest that, in some strains of mice, induction of anesthesia with isoflurane may apparently excite (disinhibit) the central nervous system more intensely than does anesthesia with enflurane or halothane.\r"

Its accuracy was compared both n vitro and n vivo to that of a calibrated pneumotachograph (Fleish #1) designed for a similar flow range. In vitro measurement of air flow with the modified Pitot tube (MPT) was within 5% of the pneumotachograph readings over a range of 1-60 l/min. Similar accuracy was found with measurement of tidal volumes from 20 ml to 1 l, delivered by a calibrated volume-cycled ventilator using a variety of inspiratory flow rates. Tidal volume measurements with the MPT were compared to the pneumotachograph using helium, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and a range of nitrous oxide/oxygen mixtures. A manual control was incorporated into the MPT electronics to allow direct measurements of tidal volume with different nitrous oxide/oxygen concentrations. In vivo, the insertion of the MPT into the patient circuit caused no apparent changes in ventilatory parameters in children under 20 kg. Measurement of tidal volumes with the MPT agreed to within 8% of pneumotachograph readings. The low dead space (1.5 cc) and light weight (12 gm) of the MPT confer advantages over the pneumotachograph (15 ml dead space and a weight of 90 gm) for routine use in pediatric anesthesia.\r"

The rate of degradation of sevoflurane by soda lime was several-fold greater than previously reported, and the degradation was temperature-dependent. At 22 degrees C, soda lime degraded 6.5% of the sevoflurane per hour. The rate increased by 1.6% per hour per degree rise in temperature, reaching 57.4% degradation per hour at 54 degrees C. In contrast, isoflurane was not degraded by soda lime. Halothane did not degrade at 22 degrees C or 37 degrees C, but did degrade (2.2% per hour) at 54 degrees C.\r"

The response patterns in both groups were characterized by a prolongation of Tl and Tl/Ttot, a reduction of respiratory frequency, and increases in airway occlusion pressure and respiratory work output. Apart from Vl, tidal volume (VT) was the only other ventilatory variable that differed significantly between age groups during loading. Arterial CO2 and O2 did not change from baseline in either group during loading, indicating that both age groups defended blood gas values equally well. The increases in occlusion pressures, inspiratory work output, and the maintenance of PaCO2 in the newborns indicated the presence of load compensatory mechanisms despite the fact that Vl was not strictly defended.\r"

Twenty-one male outpatients receiving home oxygen from liquid systems by conventional nasal cannula (NC) were fitted with OP and followed for 1 month. Oxyhemoglobin saturations (SaO2) were successfully maintained with a threefold reduction in mean O2 flow rate from 1.45 to 0.46 L/min. Exercise testing demonstrated no change between the 2 systems in either degree of desaturation or duration of exercise. Because the same benefit was achieved at lower O2 flow with the OP, 14 patients were able to utilize their O2 for longer periods of time without refilling their portable liquid units. Liquid O2 use per patient was reduced from 200 pounds/month with NC to 135 pounds/month with OP. In 12 patients who reported full compliance during the study period; a net savings of $141/month/patient was realized. However, 9 of the 21 patients stopped using the OP before completing the study. Patient evaluations of the OP identified several factors leading to poor compliance, including bulkiness and/or poor fit (16 patients), ear discomfort (8 patients), nasal discomfort (6 patients), and required nasal breathing (6 patients). While significant savings were achieved with OP, problems with patient acceptance may limit its practicality, particularly in continuous use situations. The primary benefit of the OP may be in extending the range of portable oxygen systems.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with severe respiratory disease, the work of breathing is increased and the respiratory muscles, particularly those of inspiration, may become fatigued. Hitherto, there has been little information on the incidence of respiratory muscle fatigue in acutely breathless patients. We studied 34 patients with severe respiratory disease on admission to hospital when they were most breathless, and then, if possible, 7 to 14 days later after recovery for evidence of sternomastoid muscle fatigue or increased fatigability. Frequency/force curves, numerically expressed as the 20:50 ratio, were carried out in all patients on admission. Three of the 34 patients had evidence of low frequency fatigue (i.e., greater than 15% reduction in 20:50 ratio) in the sternomastoid muscle on admission when first studied (mean +/- SEM 20:50 ratio, 56.3 +/- 1.2%; n = 3). The mean 20:50 ratio in the remaining 31 patients on admission was 75.7 +/- 1.6% (n = 31) compared with 77.8 +/- 1.4% (n = 25) when symptomatically better (p less than 0.05). The mean 20:50 ratio on admission was also significantly lower than the mean 20:50 ratio in a group of age- and sex-matched normal control subjects (i.e., 78.5 +/- 1.4%, n = 25; p less than 0.05). Twenty-five patients were studied completely both on admission and recovery, including a fatigability test that involved the performance of 50 fatiguing head lifts with measurements of the 20:50 ratio 10 and 60 min later. Sternomastoid muscle fatigability was significantly increased on admission when the patients were most breathless, compared with recovery when they were less breathless (p less than 0.001 at both 10 and 60 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measurements of FEV1, nitrogen washout curve (delta N2/L), closing volume as a percentage of vital capacity (CV/VC%), and maximal flow at 50% of VC (V50) were made prior to surgery. There were 22 smokers and 15 nonsmokers. There were more MB per cm2 of tissue than RB (0.74 versus 1.02). The mean internal diameter for MB was 0.55 +/- 0.27 mm; for RB it was 0.47 +/- 0.15 mm. There were more MB greater than 1.0 mm in internal diameter than RB greater than 1.0 mm, and the mean diameter of MB was less than that noted in autopsy specimens. The total pathology scores for all airways were less than those found in Caucasian populations. Pathology scores were higher for MB than for RB, except for pigment deposition. Inflammation scores were higher in patients with FEV1 less than 100% predicted both for RB (p less than 0.05) and for MB (p less than 0.05). FEV1 values correlated with goblet cell metaplasia scores (p less than 0.05) for MB and with fibrosis (p less than 0.05), pigment deposition (p less than 0.05), and intraluminal macrophages (p less than 0.05) for RB.

On separate days, we administered SO2 in humidified air through a mouthpiece at 2 concentrations (0.5 and 1.0 ppm) for 3 time periods (1, 3, and 5 min) during eucapnic hyperpnea (60 L/min). Humidified air was administered for 5 min as a control. Bronchoconstriction was assessed by measurement of specific airway resistance (SRaw). The magnitude of the bronchoconstrictor response to both concentrations of SO2 increased progressively over the 3 time periods studied. The mean (+/- SE) increase in SRaw (in L x cm H2O/L/s) and percent increase above baseline (in parentheses) after each exposure to SO2 were as follows: 2.5 +/- 0.3 (34%) after 0.5 ppm for 1 min; 7.5 +/- 4.7 (93%) after 1.0 ppm for 1 min; 13 +/- 3.2 (173%) after 0.5 ppm for 3 min; 31.4 +/- 7.4 (395%) after 1.0 ppm for 3 min; 19.6 +/- 4.0 (234%) after 0.5 ppm for 5 min; 44.1 +/- 9.8 (580%) after 1.0 ppm for 5 min; 3.5 +/- 1.5 (46%) after humidified air for 5 min. For the group, the increases in SRaw caused by inhalation of both concentrations of SO2 for 1 min were small. However, 2 of 8 subjects did develop large increases in SRaw and chest tightness after inhalation of 1.0 ppm for 1 min. Seven of 8 subjects developed wheezing, chest tightness, or dyspnea and used an inhaled bronchodilator after inhalation of 0.5 ppm for 3 and 5 min and 1.0 ppm for 3 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When either sulfur species dissolves in aqueous solutions, a pH-dependent equilibrium is established predominantly among bisulfite ion (HSO3-), sulfite ion (SO3=), and SO2. In addition, hydrogen ions may be released. To assess the relative bronchoconstricting potencies of these chemical forms and the role of acidity caused by the release of hydrogen ions in SO2- and sulfite-induced bronchoconstriction, we administered to 10 asthmatic subjects nebulized sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) solutions at pH 9 containing 95% sulfite, at pH 6.6 containing 80% bisulfite, and at pH 4 containing 99% bisulfite but greater than an order of magnitude more SO2 than the pH 6.6 solutions. Subjects inhaled increasing concentrations of aerosolized Na2SO3 at each pH during 1 min of tidal breathing. Subjects also breathed buffered acetic acid aerosols with the same acidity of the pH 4 Na2SO3 solutions to control for the airway effects of acid aerosols. To assess sensitivity to SO2 gas, subjects inhaled increasing concentrations of SO2 during eucapneic hyperpnea. Bronchoconstrictor response was assessed by measuring specific airway resistance (SRaw) before and after each challenge. Nine of the 10 subjects developed bronchoconstriction after inhaling the Na2SO3 aerosols at all 3 levels of pH and the SO2 gas. The mean concentration of Na2SO3 solution calculated to increase SRaw by 100% above baseline was significantly different (p less than 0.01) at the various levels of pH: pH 4 (0.17 mg/ml) less than pH 6.6 (0.49 mg/ml) less than pH 9 (2.10 mg/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To help assess respiratory health risks from sulfur dioxide (SO2) air pollution, we studied 24 normal, 21 atopic, 16 minimal/mild asthmatic, and 24 moderate/severe, medication-dependent asthmatic subjects classified according to history, lung function, allergy skin tests, serum IgE level, and airway reactivity to methacholine. All were exposed in a chamber (21 degrees C, 50% humidity) to 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 ppm SO2 in random order at 1-wk intervals; then exposures were repeated to test consistency of response. The 1-h exposures included three 10-min exercise periods (ventilation approximately 40 L/min). Physiologic response was measured early (approximately 15 min) and late (approximately 55 min) in exposure. Symptoms were evaluated during exposure and for 1 wk afterward. Normal and most atopic subjects showed little response at these SO2 levels. A few atopic subjects and many asthmatics developed bronchoconstriction and respiratory symptoms, but most were able to maintain their exercise. Effects were not markedly different between early and late measurements, nor between the first and second round of studies; however, late and second-round responses appeared slightly more favorable. No statistically significant effect of SO2 on symptoms was found 1 day or 1 wk after exposure. Minimal/mild asthmatics showed, on the average, slight responses at 0.0 ppm (attributable to exercise) and increasing responses at increasing SO2 concentrations. Moderate/severe asthmatics reacted more at 0.0 ppm, but their increments in response with increasing SO2 concentration were roughly similar to those of minimal/mild asthmatics. Thus, responses to SO2 per se were not strongly dependent on clinical severity of asthma, nor on SO2 exposure history during previous weeks.\r"

  ".W": "The physiologic roles of the 2 muscarinic receptors (M1 and M2) in the vagal control of pulmonary resistance were studied by comparing the effects of pirenzepine (PZ, M1-blocker), gallamine (GAL, M2-blocker), and atropine (AT, M1- and M2-blocker) on the increase in pulmonary resistance (RL) and on the reduction in heart rate (HR) during bilateral cervical vagus nerve stimulation in 18 anesthetized (chloralose and urethane) and paralyzed (vecuronium) dogs. PZ, AT, and GAL all inhibited the reduction in HR during vagus nerve stimulation, although the inhibition required relatively high doses of PZ and GAL. AT and PZ inhibited the increase in RL during vagus nerve stimulation. The ratio of the dose needed to inhibit by 50% the HR response to the dose needed to inhibit by 50% the RL response was approximately 45:1 for PZ, 12:1 for AT, and less than 0.4:1 for GAL. Thus, compared with AT, PZ is a more selective blocker of vagally induced increases in RL, indicating that M1 receptors are present in the airway smooth muscle of intact anesthetized dogs. In the same dose range as that which caused the inhibition of the HR response, GAL had no consistent effect on the increase in RL during vagus nerve stimulation, indicating that M2 receptors do not mediate the increase in RL in intact anesthetized dogs.\r"

Ten healthy and 10 asthmatic subjects inhaled via a mouth-piece 0.12 or 0.18 ppm of ozone (O3) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or clean air for 30 min at rest followed by 10 min during moderate exercise (32.5 L/min) on a treadmill. The following pulmonary functional values were measured before and after exposure: peak flow, total respiratory resistance (RT), maximal flow at 50 and 75% of expired VC, and FEV1. After exercise exposure to 0.18 ppm O3, statistically significant increases were seen in RT in asthmatic and healthy adolescent subjects. No consistent changes were seen in either group after NO2 exposure. Also, no significant differences in response to oxidant pollutants between the 2 groups could be demonstrated. It was concluded that neither group was consistently sensitive to these pollutants.\r"

To examine the mechanisms involved, we measured airway responses to increasing doses of intravenous or inhaled acetylcholine in guinea pigs exposed to cigarette smoke (n = 20) or to air (n = 20). After exposure the guinea pigs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and studied in a pressure-sensitive body plethysmograph while ventilated through a tracheostomy. Two and 6 puffs of an aerosol of increasing concentrations (0.05 to 500 micrograms/ml) of acetylcholine were delivered via the tracheostomy. Intravenous acetylcholine was delivered in boluses of 0.1 ml of increasing concentrations (0.5 to 50,000 micrograms/ml) via a catheter in an external jugular vein. Pulmonary resistance (RL), dynamic compliance (Cdyn), and heart rate (HR) were measured at baseline (after aerosolized or intravenous saline) and after each dose of acetylcholine. The peak responses to both inhaled and intravenous acetylcholine were rapid in onset (less than 15 s), short-lived (3 to 4 breaths), and were noncumulative. The baseline RL, Cdyn, and HR were not different in the smoke and air exposure groups. In the intravenous acetylcholine group, there were no differences in RL, Cdyn, and HR responses between the air and smoke exposure groups. In the inhaled acetylcholine group, the dose-response curve was shifted to the left (p less than 0.05) and reached a higher maximal response (p less than 0.01) after smoke exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Theophylline absorption from 2 sustained-release theophylline (S-RT) formulations was examined over 2 consecutive days during continuous therapy in 8 clinically stable hospitalized patients with moderate to severe asthma. Theo-24, a formulation intended for once-daily dosing, produced larger fluctuations in serum theophylline concentration (STC) than did twice-daily Theo-Dur (214 +/- 106% versus 89 +/- 33%, p less than 0.02). Bioavailability for both formulations was essentially complete over 2 consecutive study days (95 +/- 22% and 87 +/- 8% for Theo-Dur versus 88 +/- 21% and 87 +/- 24% for Theo-24 on Days 1 and 2, respectively). The time of maximal STC (Tmax) and minimal STC (Tmin) over a 24-h period were relatively predictable for Theo-24 with Tmax 6 to 14 h postdose, and Tmin occurring at the time of dose. However, only Tmax (4 to 10 h post-A.M. dose) was predictable for Theo-Dur. The mean maximal STC over a 24-h period (Cmax) for Theo-Dur was 13.9 (range, 8.9 to 20.7 micrograms/ml), whereas the mean 6-h post-AM dose STC was 13.0 (range, 8.0 to 20.7 micrograms/ml), indicating that the STC at this 6-h time point represents a very close estimate of the true Cmax. Similarly, the mean Cmax for Theo-24 was 14.5 (range, 6.2-20.4 micrograms/ml), and the mean 10-h post-dose STC was 13.7 (range, 3.6 to 20.4 micrograms/ml), suggesting that this time point approximates the true Cmax.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
