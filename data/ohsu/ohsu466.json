However, there are few objective, prospective, randomized studies present in the literature to aid the clinical otolaryngologist with the proper tube choice for middle ear aeration. A prospective, randomized study was undertaken of four commonly used tympanostomy tubes. Shepard Teflon grommet, Armstrong beveled tube, Reuter-Bobbin tube, and Goode T-tube. This study was undertaken to determine which of these tubes had the fewest number of postplacement complications, including otorrhea, plugging, residual perforation, or chronic persistence in the tympanic membrane. Average follow-up was 17 months. The Shepard and Armstrong tubes showed a comparatively low rate of plugging and otorrhea. Both tubes had extrusion times that averaged less than 1 year. The Reuter-Bobbin tube had a much greater rate of plugging, compared to the other tubes. The T-tube had an increased incidence of otorrhea and persistence in the tympanic membrane well beyond 1 year. The T-tube was also the only tube in this study associated with residual perforations.\r"

The tonsil core cultures showed a high incidence of Hemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, which was rarely reflected on surface culture. The study indicates that pharyngeal swab cultures do not reliably reflect the presence of pathogens in the tonsil core. The value of parameters such as history of recurrent bouts of tonsillitis and presence of erythema or cryptic debris on physical examination for predicting the differential bacteriology of the tonsil is studied. The implications for treatment of children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy are discussed.\r"

The radiologic assessment included 25 sialograms, 162 computed tomography scans, and 10 nuclear magnetic resonance images. The diagnosis is influenced by the following four parameters of computed tomography: tumor borders, density, homogeneity, and enhancement. Well-defined borders, a homogeneous appearance, and high density strongly favor the diagnosis of a benign tumor or a low-grade malignancy (96.7%). Ill-defined tumor borders, heterogeneity, and high density indicate mainly a high-grade or recurrent malignancy (68.8%). Ill-defined borders, a heterogeneous appearance, and mixed density identify a lymphoepithelial lesion, lymphangioma, or sialoadenitis (100%). Sialography is cost effective in the evaluation of lymphoepithelial lesions. Computed tomography sialography offers no advantages over computed tomography with intravenous contrast. High-resolution computed tomography with intravenous contrast is highly sensitive for tumor detection (97%). Magnetic resonance imaging is complementary or superior to computed tomography (100%).\r"

At the latter date, the concordance between radiography and clinical findings was 71% and between sonography and clinical findings, 93%. The two modalities studied appear to be equally useful in the initial diagnosis of acute maxillary sinusitis. The loss of back-wall echo correlates well with symptomatic improvement of acute sinusitis. Sonography is also nonionizing and inexpensive, and the examination is simple to repeat.\r"

  ".U": "89143658\r", 
  ".W": "Chorionic villus sampling is a method of prenatal diagnosis in the first trimester of pregnancy in which tissue for genetic study is aspirated from the developing placenta by means of a catheter inserted transcervically under the guidance of ultrasonography. In this seven-center study, we compared the safety and efficacy of chorionic villus sampling in 2278 women with those of amniocentesis at 16 weeks' gestation in 671 women. Both groups were made up primarily of well-educated private patients; they were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy and had viable pregnancies verified by ultrasound examination. Cytogenetic diagnoses resulted from 97.8 percent of the chorionic villus sampling procedures and 99.4 percent of the amniocenteses (P less than 0.05); aneuploidy was found in 1.8 and 1.4 percent, respectively, of the cases in which diagnoses were made. Of the women who underwent chorionic villus sampling, 17 (0.8 percent) subsequently had an amniocentesis because the diagnosis was ambiguous. Two of the diagnoses of aneuploidy (one tetraploidy, one trisomy 22) were later proved to be incorrect. On the basis of pediatric examination of the infants subsequently born to the women in the sample, there were no errors in the determination of sex or the identification of the major trisomies (21, 18, and 13). The rate of combined losses due to spontaneous and missed abortions, termination of abnormal pregnancies, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths was 7.2 percent in the group that underwent chorionic villus sampling and 5.7 percent in the group that had amniocentesis. After adjustment for slight differences in gestational and maternal age, the total loss rate for the women in the chorionic villus sampling group exceeded that for the amniocentesis group by only 0.8 percentage points (80 percent confidence interval, -0.6 to 2.2). The rate of loss of chromosomally normal fetuses after chorionic villus sampling was 10.8 percent among women in whom three or four attempts were made to place the transcervical catheter, as compared with 2.9 percent in those in whom only one attempt was necessary (P less than 0.01). There were no serious maternal infections among the women in this study or among an additional 1990 women who underwent chorionic villus sampling (upper 95 percent confidence limit, 0.08 percent). We conclude that chorionic villus sampling is a safe and effective technique for the early prenatal diagnosis of cytogenetic abnormalities, but that it probably entails a slightly higher risk of procedure failure and of fetal loss than does amniocentesis.\r"

Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that yeast hsp60 is related to the groEL protein of E. coli and the RUBISCO-binding protein (RBP) of chloroplasts. HSP60 was found to be the genetic locus of the conditional-lethal mutation described by Cheng et al., which at non-permissive temperature is defective in the assembly of several different multisubunit complexes in mitochondria. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the groEL-related proteins serve an evolutionarily conserved function as accessory factors facilitating the folding and/or association of individual subunits of multimeric protein complexes.\r"

Proteins encoded by two cellular proto-oncogenes, c-erbA alpha and beta, bind T3 and can act as functional T3 receptors. In rats, alternative splicing of the alpha-gene transcript generates at least two distinct protein products, termed r-erbA alpha 1 and r-erbA alpha 2. Although these proteins bind to the same DNA sequence, r-erbA alpha 2 does not bind T3. We show here that expression of r-erbA alpha 2 inhibits the T3-dependent inductive effect of either r-erbA beta or r-erbA alpha 1 on expression of a T3-responsive test gene. Alternative splicing of the erbA alpha transcript thus generates products with opposing biological activities, suggesting a novel mechanism for the modulation of hormonal responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "c-Myc plays a part in the regulation of important cellular processes such as growth, differentiation and neoplastic transformation. Although c-myc gene structure and expression are well characterized, the function and biochemical properties of the protein are less well understood. Human c-myc is a 439-amino acid phosphoprotein which binds DNA in vitro and belongs to a discrete subset of nuclear proteins. Using the human c-myc mutants generated by linker-insertion and deletion mutagenesis, we have defined regions of the protein that are important for its transforming activities and its nuclear localization. Here, we show that human c-myc exists as an oligomer in vitro and use mutant proteins to localize the oligomerization domain to a carboxyl-terminal peptide containing the 'leucine zipper' motif. The 'leucine zipper' describes a structure found in a number of DNA-binding proteins that contains leucines occurring at intervals of every seventh amino acid in a region predicted to be alpha-helical. The 'leucine zipper' might mediate dimerization by intermolecular interdigitation of the leucine side-chains. We show that a c-myc mutant, which is inactive but can oligomerize, dominantly inhibits the cotransforming activity with wild-type c-myc of rat embryo cells, whereas inactive mutants which cannot oligomerize properly because of deletions in the oligomerization domain are recessive.\r"

A common kinase-mediated phosphotransfer reaction has recently been identified in chemotaxis, nitrogen regulation, and osmoregulation. In chemotaxis, the CheA kinase passes a phosphoryl group to the cytoplasmic protein CheY, which functions as a phosphorylation-activated switch that interacts with flagellar components to regulate motility. We report here the X-ray crystal structure of the Salmonella typhimurium CheY protein. The determination of the structure was facilitated by the use of site-specific mutagenesis to engineer heavy-atom binding sites. CheY is a single-domain protein composed of a doubly wound five-stranded parallel beta-sheet. The phosphoacceptor site in CheY is probably a cluster of aspartic-acid side chains near the C-terminal edge of the beta-sheet. The pattern of sequence similarity of CheY with components of other regulatory systems can be interpreted in the light of the CheY structure and supports the view that this family of proteins have a common structural motif and active site.\r"

  ".U": "89143771\r", 
  ".W": "A major mechanism by which insulin stimulates glucose transport in muscle and fat is the translocation of glucose transporters from an intracellular membrane pool to the cell surface. The existence of a distinct insulin-regulatable glucose transporter was suggested by the poor cross-reactivity between antibodies specific for either the HepG2 or rat brain glucose transporters and the rat adipocyte glucose transporter. More direct evidence was provided by the production of a monoclonal antibody (mAb 1F8) specific for the rat adipocyte glucose transporter that immunolabels a species of relative molecular mass 43,000 (43K) present only in tissues that exhibit insulin-dependent glucose transport, suggesting that this protein may be encoded by a different gene from the previously described mammalian glucose transporters. This antibody has been used to immunoprecipitate a 43K protein that was photoaffinity-labelled with cytochalasin B in a glucose displaceable way, and to immunolabel a protein in the plasma membrane of rat adipocytes, whose concentration was increased at least fivefold after cellular insulin exposure. Here we describe the cloning and sequencing of cDNAs isolated from both rat adipocyte and heart libraries that encode a protein recognized by mAb 1F8, and which has 65% sequence identity to the human HepG2 glucose transporter. This cDNA hybridizes to an mRNA present only in skeletal muscle, heart and adipose tissue. Our data indicate that this cDNA encodes a membrane protein with the characteristics of the translocatable glucose transporter expressed in insulin-responsive tissues.\r"

It is difficult to distinguish between these on the basis of genetic evidence because they give rise to similar predictions. All models invoke initiation at specific sites to explain polarity, which is a gradient in gene conversion frequency from one end of a gene to the other. In the accompanying paper we describe the localization of an initiation site for gene conversion to the promoter region of the ARG4 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that a double-strand break appears at the ARG4 recombination initiation site at the time of recombination, and that the broken DNA molecules end in long single-stranded tails.\r"

  ".W": "Neurons expressing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), found in the septal-preoptic nuclei and hypothalamus, control the release of gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary gland and facilitate reproductive behaviour. LHRH-expressing neurons are also found in the nervus terminalis, a cranial nerve that is a part of the accessory olfactory system and which projects directly from the nose to the septal-preoptic nuclei in the brain. During development, LHRH-immunoreactivity is detected in the peripheral parts of the nervus terminalis before it is found in the brain. Using a combination of LHRH immunocytochemistry and tritiated thymidine autoradiography in fetal mice, we show that LHRH neurons originate in the medial olfactory placode of the developing nose, migrate across the nasal septum and enter the forebrain with the nervus terminalis, arching into the septal-preoptic area and hypothalamus. Clinically, this migratory route for LHRH-expressing neurons could explain the deficiency of gonadotropins seen in 'Kallmann's syndrome' (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with anosmia).\r"

Four and one-half years of intensive planning, regulatory agency review, and analysis of published results preceded the first radiosurgical procedure. Installation of this 18,000-kg device and loading of the 201 cobalt-60 sources posed major challenges in engineering, architecture, and radiophysics. In the first 4 months of operation, we treated 52 patients (29 with arteriovenous malformations, 19 with extra-axial neoplasms of the skull base, and 4 with intra-axial malignant tumors). Most patients either had lesions considered \"inoperable\" or had residual lesions after attempted surgical resection. Neither surgical mortality nor significant morbidity was associated with gamma knife radiosurgery. As compared with treatment by conventional intracranial surgery (craniotomy), the average length of stay for radiosurgery was reduced by 4 to 14 days, and hospital charges were reduced by as much as 65%. Based on both the previously published results of treatment of more than 2,000 patients worldwide and on our initial clinical experience, we believe that gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery is a therapeutically effective and economically sound alternative to more conventional neurosurgical procedures, in selected cases.\r"

The histological diagnosis at stereotactic biopsy was appropriate for direction of clinical management in 28 of 30 patients. Correlation between the stereotactic and resection diagnoses was exact in 19 of 30 cases. These included 11 of 12 nonastrocytic neoplasms and 8 of 13 astrocytic neoplasms. Correlation was imperfect in 9 of 30 cases, but not to the extent of having significant clinical impact. These included 2 cases of anaplastic astrocytoma that were upgraded to glioblastoma multiforme, 2 cases of astrocytoma that had a significant oligodendroglial component, and 5 non-neoplastic lesions that were reported on biopsy as showing nonspecific reactive changes. In 2 of 30 patients, the stereotactic biopsy was not accurate. This included one patient who had glioblastoma multiforme whose stereotactic biopsy showed only necrotic tissue. Serious diagnostic error that resulted in clinical mismanagement occurred in one patient who had a pineal germinoma that had large areas of granulomatous inflammation at which the stereotactic biopsy was directed. This study provides evidence that, with careful target placement, stereotactic biopsy can provide biopsy material that represents the entire lesion with an accuracy that is sufficient for clinical management.\r"

Also, the evolution of carotid surgery over the past two decades makes it impossible to compare earlier operative technique with the state-of-the-art technique of today. Our series of 7 patients underwent 9 carotid endarterectomies with an average follow-up period of 46 months. The number of patients is small, and although technically this is a more difficult operation, we feel the results are favorable and may be comparable with endarteerctomy procedures in nonirradiated patients. These patients should be approached as if radiation changes are not a major factor when they are considered for reconstructive arterial surgery.\r"

The appearance of the cervicomental area may be the result of many factors, including mandibular hypoplasia, localized lipodystrophy, a low-positioned hyoid bone, platysmal deformity, soft tissue laxity, or a combination of any of these. Although much attention has been directed toward correction of bony contour deformities of the mandible and chin, minimal emphasis has been placed on evaluation and correction of soft tissue disharmonies in the submental-submandibular areas. This article discusses the indications and contraindications, patient examination, surgical technique, and potential complications of suction-assisted lipectomy of the cervicomental region. Select cases are presented to illustrate the concepts and techniques discussed herein.\r"

  ".U": "89144474\r", 
  ".W": "Autopsy studies have suggested that candidal pseudohyphae may be found in dorsal glossal epithelium in 38% to 42% of cases. Candidal yeast forms, and occasionally free pseudohyphae, are found as oral commensals in about 44% of the population. This study examined the possible distorting influence in autopsy studies that could be caused by postmortem hyphal transformation of candidal yeast forms followed by saprophytic infestation. Candida albicans yeast forms were topically applied to the middorsal glossal mucosa of five healthy pigs, immediately after killing. Biopsy specimens from this mucosa were subsequently maintained, in vitro, for periods of 12 and 24 hours in humid conditions at different temperature regression rates chosen to approximate those of the oral cavity after death. Biopsy specimens subjected to a temperature regression of 35 degrees C (oral temperature) to 23 degrees C (room temperature) over 11 hours showed infestation of epithelium by pseudohyphae in all cases. Biopsy specimens subjected to a similar temperature regression over 5 hours showed infestation in two of five cases. Control biopsy specimens showed that there was no candidal infection at the time of killing. The results indicate that in vitro saprophytic candidal infestation is possible in the time intervals and the declining oral temperatures preceding autopsy. It suggests that postmortem saprophytic candidal infestation may distort results from autopsy studies that do not anticipate this problem.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the overall clinical success of TKR arthroplasty, materials' limitations are becoming increasingly obvious as designs and surgical techniques improve. As in the case of THR components, the ultimate limiting factor now appears to be wear of the tibiofemoral articulation and its biologic consequences. Although some materials appear to hold out promise of improvement, no combination better than cobalt-base alloy/UHMWPE has yet appeared. In addition, the very long service times now expected routinely (greater than 10 years) for total joint replacement increase the problem of new materials' selection owing to the well-known disparities between in vitro wear tests and in vivo performance and the absence of any consensus on correlation between accelerated testing and real-time performance, either in vitro or in vivo. For these reasons, extreme caution is counseled in the early clinical trials of newer materials and combinations of materials. The clinical \"rule of thumb\" for publication of clinical results, 2-year minimum follow-up, is necessary but highly insufficient for materials' qualification. Good to excellent results, with no signs of progressive failure for 5 to 7 years of prospective study, combined with high-yield follow-up to 10 years, will probably be necessary for safe introduction of such materials into general clinical use. An excessively rapid introduction could predispose to clinical failure, through lack of knowledge of critical design and manufacturing parameters, and prove an impediment to improvement of TKR arthroplasty.\r"

Twenty-eight in-patients with cancer pain received a short-term infusion lasting 2-42 days, and 8 out-patients underwent long-term infusion from 49 to 197 days during the terminal stage of their disease. Continuous subcutaneous morphine infusion significantly (P less than 0.001) improved both pain and quality of life when compared to conventional morphine application. With continuous infusion, 5-48 mg (median 19 mg) of morphine was required daily, significantly (P less than 0.001) less than the 10-90 mg (median 50 mg) necessary with conventional use. As a result of lower dosage, side effects under continuous infusion were infrequent and mild. Constipation occurred in 3 of the 36 patients and was always controlled by the addition of laxatives; no nausea, sedation or respiratory depression were observed. Signs of tolerance developed in 2 patients on long-term infusion, but the use of continuous subcutaneous methadone for 2 weeks reversed the tolerance. The study presented indicates that low-dose continuous subcutaneous morphine provides a valuable treatment modality for severe terminal cancer pain exhibiting a high degree of both efficacy and safety.\r"

Planned duration of treatment was 10 days. Pain intensity was evaluated by a visual analog scale. The length of patient participation in the trial, the patient's final global evaluation and the incidence of side effects were also evaluated. Ninety-nine patients were enrolled in the study. All treatments produced a statistically significant pain relief (P less than 0.01) without differences among groups but only 26 of 99 patients (26.3%) completed the planned treatment period. Mean time in the study was 4.65 days. Inefficacy and side effects were the main reasons for premature treatment interruption. Patients treated with nefopam had a significantly shorter period in the study than patients treated with the other 2 treatments. Adverse effects were slightly more frequent with the nefopam and ASA + codeine regimens. The 3 therapeutic regimens appear to be similar as to analgesic efficacy, but diclofenac presents the advantage of a slightly better safety profile than nefopam and the ASA + codeine combination.\r"

The treatment group received an intervention designed to reduce current problems, but above all to prevent reinjury and minor pains from becoming chronic medical problems, and it included a physical and behavioral therapy package. The control group was placed on a waiting-list. Results indicated that the treatment group had significantly greater improvements than the control group for pain intensity, anxiety, sleep quality and fatigue ratings, observed pain behavior, activities, mood, and helplessness. These differences were generally maintained at the 6 month follow-up. In addition, the treatment group broke a trend for increasing amounts of pain-related absenteeism, while the control group did not. Taken as a whole, the results suggest that a secondary prevention program aimed at altering life style factors may represent an effective method for dealing with musculoskeletal pain problems.\r"

However, the benefit from IVP was believed to be questionable in children with normal ultrasonography findings and vesicoureteral reflux of only a low grade (I or II of V). To gain a better understanding of the need for IVP in the radiologic evaluation of such children, the database was expanded and the findings concerning ultrasonography and IVP were analyzed in 52 children with urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux seen during the last 3 years. Of a total of 72 instances of reflux, 44 (61.1%) were of low grade (I or II), 14 of medium grade (III), and 14 of high grade (IV or V). Of the 44 urinary systems with low-grade reflux, results were as follows: renal ultrasonography appeared normal in 38 and in 34 of these, the IVP also appeared normal; in the other four, only minor and negligible changes were seen with IVP. Surgical intervention was not necessary in any of these 38 urinary systems. In six systems with low-grade vesicoureteral reflux but with abnormal ultrasonography findings, IVP results were also abnormal, and surgery was necessary in two instances. Of the 14 urinary systems with medium-grade reflux, ultrasonography appeared normal in ten but in six of these the IVP appeared abnormal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Within 15 minutes of common carotid artery ligation, blood flow was detected in one infant's right middle cerebral artery; however, the velocity was reduced to 50% of the preextracorporeal membrane oxygenation level. The velocity remained 50% to 70% lower than normal during the 88 hours of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. In the other two infants, the velocity changes were less severe. By 2 to 10 weeks after weaning from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the velocities in the left cerebral arteries were increased to 116% to 217% of the corresponding right cerebral vessels. Following common carotid artery ligation, a retrograde direction of flow was noted in the first (A1) segment of the right anterior cerebral artery and in the right posterior communicating artery, whereas the direction of flow was normal in the corresponding vessels on the left. After common carotid artery ligation, the vertebrobasilar and the contralateral internal carotid systems appear to be the main sources of reperfusion of the right cerebral hemisphere via the circle of Willis. Furthermore, because of the known variants of the circle anatomy, a noninvasive pulsed Doppler method could be used to evaluate the flow patterns in the circle of Willis arteries, both before and after common carotid artery ligation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\r"

During an initial 3-month period, symptomatic upper respiratory tract infections associated with throat cultures or rapid antigen detection tests positive for group A streptococci developed in 55 of 214 (26%) children and adult staff in one day-care center. When the entire day-care center population (except for those receiving antibiotics at the time) was then surveyed, 52 of 146 (36%) children and two of 24 (8%) adult staff had throat cultures positive for group A streptococci. Of the 54 group A streptococcal isolates found during the survey, the three most frequently encountered serotypes were M2,T2/28 (35%), M3,T3/13 (30%), and M-NT, T25 (20%). Rapid antigen detection was performed at the same time as the throat culture in the first 98 individuals examined during the culture survey but was positive in only 11 (35%) of 31 individuals with positive throat cultures. Sensitivity of the rapid antigen test was related to degree of positivity of the throat culture but not to age. The overall group A streptococcal positivity rate was 49% for 187 children and 33% for 27 adult staff; 18 of 66 (27%) children younger than 31/2 years of age were found to have group A streptococci in their upper respiratory tracts. This is the first report of high prevalence rates of group A streptococci associated with upper respiratory tract infections in a day-care center. The group A Streptococcus may represent a significant upper respiratory tract pathogen in the day-care setting.\r"

A blinded randomized trial was conducted to determine whether taurine supplementation of healthy infants of less than or equal to 1,300 g birth weight until their discharge from the hospital increases their growth rate, neurobehavioral development, electroretinographic development, or maturation of auditory brainstem-evoked responses. Infants were fed with Similac Special Care as desired, which was prepared to contain less than 5 mg/L of taurine or 45 mg/L of taurine, a concentration similar to that of human milk. Infants who did not receive taurine supplementation (n = 19) and those who did (n = 18) were similar with respect to condition at study entry, caloric intake, and growth rates throughout the study, and electroretinographic findings and scores on the Brazelton Behavioral Assessment Scale at 37 weeks' postmenstrual age. Infants who received taurine supplementation had greater overall plasma taurine concentrations. The group receiving taurine supplementation also had more mature auditory-evoked responses at 37 weeks' postmenstrual age with a modest (0.2 to 0.5 ms) but consistent reduction (P less than .05) in the interval between stimulus and response at two different stimulation rates. Although further study is needed, taurine intake appears to influence auditory system maturation of preterm infants.\r"

  ".W": "Taurine was long considered an end product of the metabolism of the sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and cyst(e)ine. Its only clearly recognized biochemical role had been as a substrate in the conjugation of bile acids. Taurine is found free in millimolar concentrations in animal tissues, particularly those that are excitable, rich in membranes, and generate oxidants. Various lines of evidence suggest one major nutritional role as protecting cell membranes by attenuating toxic substances and/or by acting as an osmoregulator. The totality of evidence suggests that taurine is nonessential in the rodent, it is an essential amino acid in the cat, and it is conditionally essential in man and monkey. Absence from the diet of a conditionally essential nutrient does not produce immediate deficiency disease but, in the long term, can cause problems. Taurine is now added to many infant formulas as a measure of prudence to provide improved nourishment with the same margin of safety for its newly identified physiologic functions as that found in human milk. Such supplementation can be justified by the finding of improved fat absorption in preterm infants and in children with cystic fibrosis, as well as by salutary effects on auditory brainstem-evoked responses in preterm infants. Experimental findings in animal models and in human cell models provide further justification for taurine supplementation of infant formulas.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work has shown that in Escherichia coli K-12 growth-rate-dependent regulation of expression of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, encoded by the gnd gene, occurs at the posttranscriptional level and is mediated by a negative control element that lies deep in the coding sequence, somewhere between codons 48 and 118. Deletion analysis of a growth-rate-regulated gnd-lacZ translational fusion showed that the element is the segment of gnd mRNA between codons 67 and 78 that is complementary to an extensive portion of the gnd ribosome-binding site, including its Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The boundaries of the element were further defined by the cloning of a synthetic \"internal complementary sequence.\" The core internal complementary sequence element effected growth-rate-dependent regulation when placed at several sites between codon 40 and codon 69, but it severely reduced gene expression when moved to codon 13. The effect on regulation of single and double mutations introduced into the element by site-directed mutagenesis correlated with the ability of the respective mRNAs to fold into secondary structures that sequester the ribosome-binding site. Thus the gnd gene's internal regulatory element appears to function as a cis-acting antisense RNA.\r"

  ".W": "Osmoregulated expression of proU has been reconstituted in a cell-free system. proU encodes an osmotically inducible, high-affinity transport system for the osmoprotectant glycine betaine in Escherichia coli. Previously, a proU-lacZ fusion gene had been cloned, resulting in plasmid pOS3. In vivo osmoregulation of this extrachromosomal proU-lacZ fusion gene at low copy number showed that the plasmid-encoded fusion contained all the necessary sequences in cis for correctly receiving osmoregulatory signals during induction by osmotic stress and repression by glycine betaine. Using a cell-free (S-30) extract, plasmid pOS3 was then used to program protein synthesis in vitro. The ionic compound potassium glutamate specifically stimulated proU-lacZ expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Potassium acetate also induced some proU expression, but other salts were ineffective, thereby ruling out ionic strength as the stimulatory signal. High concentrations of sucrose, trehalose, or glycine betaine did not induce proU expression in vitro either, eliminating osmolarity per se as the stimulus. Reconstitution in a cell-free system rules out osmoregulatory mechanisms that depend on turgor, trans-membrane signaling, or trans-acting regulators synthesized after osmotic upshock.\r"

  ".W": "These studies describe the detection of a haptoglobin species, its characterization as the HPR gene product, and its association with both pregnancy and neoplasia. Previous work showed that the early recurrence of human breast cancer correlated with immunohistochemical staining with a commercial antiserum ostensibly directed against pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A). Use of this antiserum to guide purification of the putative antigen led to the present identification and purification of a strongly immunoreactive protein species distinct from PAPP-A that was present in the plasma of pregnant women at term. Unlike PAPP-A, a homotetramer of 200-kDa polypeptides, the immunoreactive protein consists of a light (alpha) chain (16.5 kDa) and a heavy (beta) chain (40 kDa); protein microsequencing of the beta chain showed it to be a member of the haptoglobin family. The alpha chain of this haptoglobin species differs from ordinary haptoglobin 1 and 2 alpha chains both structurally and immunologically and represents the product of the HPR gene, haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr), since (i) the apparent molecular mass is the same as that predicted for Hpr alpha chain, (ii) the peptide map differs from that of haptoglobin 1 in a manner predicted by the HPR nucleotide sequence, (iii) monospecific antibodies that react with epitopes shared by the unique alpha chain and a synthetic peptide derived from the HPR nucleotide sequence do not detect these epitopes in either haptoglobin 1 or 2, and (iv) sequences of alpha-chain peptides were consistent with this identification, excluding haptoglobin 1 but not haptoglobin 2. The immunohistochemical reactivity of antibodies raised to the synthetic Hpr peptide is similar to that of anti-PAPP-A. Moreover, staining of neoplastic breast tissue is abolished by preincubation with purified Hpr.\r"

  ".W": "Signal transduction in Escherichia coli involves the interaction of transmembrane receptor proteins such as the aspartate receptor, Tar, and the products of four chemotaxis genes, cheA, cheY, cheW, and cheZ. It was previously shown that the cheA gene product is an autophosphorylating protein kinase that transfers phosphate to CheY, whereas the cheZ gene product acts as a specific CheY phosphatase. Here we report that the system can be reconstituted in vitro and receptor function can be coupled to CheY phosphorylation. Coupling requires the presence of the CheW protein, the appropriate form of the receptor, and the CheA and CheY proteins. Under these conditions the accumulation of CheY-phosphate is enhanced approximately 300-fold. This rate enhancement is seen in reactions using wild-type and \"tumble\" mutant receptors but not \"smooth\" mutant receptors. The increased accumulation of phosphoprotein was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of aspartate, using wild-type, but not tumble, receptors. These results provide evidence that the signal transduction pathway in bacterial chemotaxis involves receptor-mediated alteration of the levels of phosphorylated proteins. They suggest that CheW acts as the coupling factor between receptor and phosphorylation. The results also support the suggestion that CheY-phosphate is the tumble signal.\r"

Two regions of GM-CSF, residues 38-48 and residues 95-111, were found to be critical for hematopoietic function. These regions are structurally characterized by an amphiphilic helix and by a disulfide-bonded loop, respectively, and are homologous in position in the human and murine growth factors. In addition, competition assays suggested that, together, these regions bind to the GM-CSF receptor.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the pattern of differentiation of the small intestinal epithelium in fetal rats during the 17th through 21st days of gestation. Five genes expressed in late fetal, neonatal, and adult enterocytes were used as markers of differentiation. They encode three homologous small cytoplasmic hydrophobic ligand binding proteins--liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), and cellular retinol binding protein II (CRBP II)--and two apolipoproteins--apoAI and apoAIV. RNA blot hybridization studies indicated that gradients in mRNA concentration from the proximal small intestine to colon appear coincident with the initiation of rapid epithelial cell proliferation and villus formation (days 17-19 of the 22-day gestation period). Immunocytochemical studies disclosed a remarkably heterogeneous pattern of cell-specific expression of the three hydrophobic ligand binding proteins that was not apparent with either apoAIV or apoAI. This \"mosaic\" staining pattern was observed in morphologically similar cells occupying identical topographic positions along nascent villi in 17- to 18-day fetuses. The onset and resolution of this mosaicism varies between I-FABP, L-FABP, and CRBP II in the proximal small bowel, although it completely resolves by the first postnatal day. The distal small intestine exhibits a developmental delay of 1-2 days in the appearance of this heterogeneous pattern of initial gene expression. Double-label immunofluorescent analyses using L-FABP and I-FABP antibodies indicated that on the 18th day of gestation the proximal small intestinal columnar epithelium contains several populations of enterocytes expressing neither, one, or both proteins. The potential significance of this mosaic pattern of intestinal epithelial differentiation is discussed in light of recent studies with transgenic and chimeric mice.\r"

Because the bacteriophage T4-encoded topoisomerase resembles the mammalian enzyme, we are using T4 as a simple model system to investigate the mechanism of action of m-AMSA. A mutation that renders T4 growth m-AMSA-resistant is closely linked to an amber mutation in T4 gene 39, which encodes one of the topoisomerase subunits. In addition, the gene 39 subunit from the m-AMSA-resistant mutant phage has an altered net charge, strongly indicating that the drug-resistance mutation is within gene 39. Topoisomerase purified from mutant phage-infected Escherichia coli exhibits drug-insensitive DNA relaxation and DNA cleavage activities. Because a single mutation results in both drug-resistant phage growth and a drug-insensitive viral topoisomerase, we conclude that the T4-encoded type II DNA topoisomerase is the physiological target of m-AMSA in phage-infected E. coli.\r"

Two anti-YT IgG1 monoclonal antibodies, YTA-1 and YTA-2, recognizing different epitopes of the same 75- to 80-kDa molecule, were established. The 75-kDa antigen recognized by these monoclonal antibodies was strongly expressed on the large granular lymphocytes of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and on various lymphoid cell lines bearing IL-2R/p75. The YTA-1 and YTA-2 antibodies were mitogenic and were different from other mitogenic monoclonal antibodies such as anti-T3 (CD3), anti-T11 (CD2), and KOLT-2 (CD28). Further, they down-regulated the high-affinity IL-2R of peripheral blood mononuclear cells within 24 hr in culture. The relationship between the YTA-1/2 antigen and the IL-2R system is discussed.\r"

Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding of monoclonal antibodies to the CD28 surface antigen can augment the proliferation of purified human T cells stimulated with suboptimal doses of mitogens or anti-T-cell receptor/CD3 complex antibodies. In this report, we show that CD28 stimulation augments T-cell immune responses by specifically inducing a 5- to 50-fold enhancement in the expression and secretion of interleukin 2, tumor necrosis factor type alpha, lymphotoxin, interferon gamma, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in normal human T cells stimulated to proliferate by crosslinking of the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex. This CD28-mediated induction of lymphokine/cytokine gene expression occurred even in T cells stimulated with optimal concentrations of mitogens or anti-T-cell receptor/CD3 antibodies, although under these conditions CD28 activation failed to enhance the proliferative response. The activation pathway induced by stimulation of CD28 is distinct from other biochemical pathways that induce lymphokines/cytokines because CD28 stimulation can induce lymphokine/cytokine gene expression in the presence of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine. Together these data suggest that the CD28 cell surface molecule is part of a distinct activation pathway that specifically modulates the expression of multiple lymphokine/cytokine genes.\r"

Lyb-2 has been shown to play a role in B-cell activation and differentiation and may be a receptor for a B-cell growth factor or lymphokine. We have isolated and sequenced cDNA encoding the Lyb-2.1 allele. Lyb-2 mRNA is expressed only in B-lineage cells and is absent from antibody-secreting cell lines. The predicted protein contains 354 amino acids and is lacking an amino-terminal signal peptide. The protein is shown to be oriented with its carboxyl terminus external to the cell. Sequence comparisons demonstrate that Lyb-2 is homologous to the asialoglycoprotein receptor and to CD23, the B-cell-specific Fc receptor for IgE, both of which are oriented with their carboxyl termini external to the cell. These molecules, therefore, constitute a gene superfamily of cell surface receptors with inverted membrane orientation.\r"

Thus, helodermin-like peptides coexist with calcitonin. The results of radioimmunoassay agreed with the immunocytochemical findings. HPLC of rat thyroid extracts revealed one major peak of helodermin-like immunoreactivity, which eluted in a position close to that of lizard helodermin. Helodermin stimulated basal thyroid hormone secretion and colloid droplet formation in conscious mice. The effect of large doses of helodermin was quite long-lasting and the maximal response occurred after 2-6 hr. In addition, helodermin suppressed the incorporation of calcium into bone in conscious rats. The findings suggest that helodermin-like peptides in C cells may be involved in the local regulation of thyroid hormone secretion and in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis.\r"

This antibody reacts specifically with a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa (gp68) that is detected in the growth medium of T47D cells as well as in pleural effusion fluids from breast adenocarcinoma patients. No detectable levels of this antigen could be observed in pleural effusions of patients with cancers other than of breast origin. The H23-related antigen was localized in the cytoplasm of breast tumor cells as well as on the cell surface of both T47D cells and metastatic cells from breast cancer patients. A survey of tissue from 812 patients was performed by using H23 in an indirect immunoperoxidase assay. The results showed that the antigen was detectable in 91% of all breast tumors tested. No cytoplasmic staining was observed in either normal tissues or nonbreast carcinomas. Only one of the benign breast tissues tested (out of a total of 56 samples of tissue) was positive for this antigen. Given the ability of this antibody to specifically detect breast tumor cells, H23 may be of importance in diagnosis and in clinical follow-up of patients for the detection of metastatic lesions by imaging and for therapy.\r"

Localization of the 27-mer 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes for rat proinsulin I, glucagon, and prosomatostatin I corresponded with localization of antibodies to the three hormones. In normal rats subjected to chronic hyperglycemic clamping, the density of the proinsulin mRNA signal increased 54%, islet size and number increased approximately 100%, while proglucagon mRNA signal was reduced 81%. Resection of 50% of the pancreas increased proinsulin mRNA 36% and proglucagon mRNA 500%; islet area doubled and islet number increased 50%. In 150-day-old diabetic ob/ob mice, there was an 18-fold expansion in islet area, a 4-fold increase in islet number, but no increase in insulin gene expression. In insulin-dependent streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats, islet area and number were profoundly reduced; insulin deprivation failed to raise proinsulin mRNA in surviving beta cells above control levels. Proglucagon mRNA was high despite the hyperglycemia but was reduced by insulin within 1 hr, suggesting that insulin regulates glucagon gene expression or is required for its regulation by glucose. In situ hybridization of rat islets provides a valid semiquantitative index of insulin and glucagon biosynthesis and of islet dimensions and reveals that normal but not diabetic islets meet increased insulin demand by increasing both number and biosynthetic activity of beta cells.\r"

The immunoreactivity was associated with neurons but not glial cells and was generally weak in the neutrophils with the exception of areas such as the triangular septal nucleus, pontine nuclei, superficial layer of the superior colliculus, and gray matter of the spinal cord. The largest number of beta I PKC-immunoreactive cells was seen in the triangular septal nucleus and pontine nuclei. In these areas of dense beta I immunoreactivity, there was no or little gamma PKC immunoreactivity. The beta I PKC immunoreactivity was observed in perikarya, dendrites, and axons but not in nuclei or nucleoli. There were various patterns of cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, but the immunoreactivity was seen frequently in the periphery of the perikarya and dendrites. The intraneuronal localization of beta I PKC immunoreactivity differs from that of the subspecies that is coded by the gamma gene sequence. The results suggest that beta I PKC may play a role in the regulation of cell membrane responsiveness in particular neurons.\r"

  ".W": "A fast perfusion system was used to apply excitatory amino acids to embryonic hippocampal neurons grown in dissociated culture and voltage clamped in the whole-cell recording configuration. Responses to quisqualic acid and DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA; a potent quisqualate-like agonist) showed rapid desensitization: at 100 microM the peak inward current declined to a plateau response on average 0.2 times the peak response (mean time constant, 30 ms). Responses to L-aspartic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid also showed desensitization: at 100 microM, when recorded in Mg-free solution with 0.3 microM glycine, the peak inward current declined to a plateau value 0.5 times the peak, but with a time constant of desensitization (average, 248 ms) one order of magnitude slower than desensitization of responses to quisqualate. Responses to kainate and domoate (agonists at kainic acid receptors) did not show appreciable desensitization. Responses to L-glutamate and 5-Br-willardine (a potent non-NMDA receptor agonist), recorded in glycine-free solution with 1 mM Mg to suppress N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor activity, showed similar rapid desensitization to AMPA and quisqualate, but occurred with less depression of the peak current. The lectin concanavalin A (Con A) reduced desensitization at quisqualate receptors, with no effect on responses to kainate or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. The effect of Con A developed slowly (average time constant at 2.5 microM, 250 s) but at steady state Con A increased the plateau current evoked by 100 microM quisqualate to 13 times control. Succinyl-Con A produced only a small reduction of desensitization to quisqualate, approximately 10% of that produced by native Con A. Con A did not change the decay time constant of fast excitatory synaptic currents evoked by stimulation of presynaptic neurons, although the peak synaptic current decreased after treatment with lectin. Con A was also without effect on the block of responses to kainate produced by coapplication of quisqualate.\r"

  ".W": "Proximal duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion is an important factor in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer disease. To examine the central nervous system regulation of duodenal bicarbonate secretion, an animal model was developed that allowed cerebroventricular and intravenous injections as well as collection of duodenal perfusates in awake, freely moving rats. The hypothalamic peptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and stress (physical restraint) significantly stimulated duodenal bicarbonate secretion. These responses were abolished by pretreatment of the animals with the CRF receptor antagonist alpha-helical CRF-(9-41), hypophysectomy, and naloxone. In contrast, blockade of autonomic efferents by surgical and pharmacological means did not prevent the stimulatory effects of stress and CRF. Intravenous, but not cerebroventricular, administration of beta-endorphin that produced plasma concentrations of beta-endorphin that were similar to those produced by exogenous CRF and stress significantly stimulated duodenal bicarbonate secretion. These results indicate that endogenous CRF released during stress and exogenously administered CRF stimulate duodenal bicarbonate secretion by release of beta-endorphin from the pituitary, thus, demonstrating a functional hypothalamus-pituitary-gut axis.\r"

  ".W": "Sequential excision and grafting of burns have resulted in several new problems. We have termed one of these the \"sponge deformity,\" i.e., a grafted area where, in multiple small areas, the bed heals underneath the graft with or without slough of the overlying graft. If the graft sloughs, a pockmark forms. If the graft does not slough, an overlying bridge forms. In our experience, this deformity is very troublesome to patients because it is difficult to wash, catches on objects, bleeds, and looks quite unsightly. Between February of 1981 and June of 1986, we treated 16 patients with this deformity. All 16 patients were treated by simple excision of the bridges and pockmark edges with a curved iris scissors. In all patients, the wounds healed well and the resultant surfaces were considerably smoother. This retrospective review of the patients suggests that the deformity usually occurs around the periphery of the excised area where the excision was shallower and when thicker grafts are used. Perhaps the bed underneath the graft epithelializes from residual epithelial elements prior to vascularization of the autograft. If this is true, it might be possible to prevent the deformity by excising the wound deeper, by applying thinner grafts, or by applying allograft or xenograft, expecting that the area will heal promptly and not require autografting.\r"

  ".W": "A simple method of performing the laser-assisted end-to-side microvascular anastomosis was devised. This technique was tested on 150 Sprague-Dawley rats in two separate series of experiments. In the first, end-to-side anastomoses were performed on the iliac artery under the normal tension due to the elastic recoil of severed vessels. Four stay sutures were placed 90 degrees apart, and the intervals were \"spot welded\" with a low-wattage CO2 microsurgical laser unit. The patency rate (96 percent) was equivalent to that found in a control group utilizing the conventional all-suture method (92 percent), but there was a significantly higher aneurysm rate (44 versus 11 percent). In a second model, an arterial bypass with very low anastomotic tension was performed around an obstruction created in the carotid artery. This model resulted in turbulent flow but low anastomotic tension. Here the laser-anastomosis patency rate was 98 percent, versus 42 percent for the conventional all-suture method. The placement of fewer sutures in association with turbulent flow in this model may account for the improved patency rate. The avoidance of excessive tension at the anastomotic site reduced the incidence of aneurysms to a negligible level.\r"

Multiplanar capabilities allow ease of examination in the preferred planes. Various sequences or planes of imaging may be chosen to tailor the examination to the anatomic region of interest. The use of Gd-DTPA with T1-weighted images should further improve diagnostic precision of tumor location and extension and may replace the need for the longer T2-weighted sequences. Gadolinium may help differentiate tumor recurrence from fibrosis in the post-radiation patient.

MRI's superior contrast resolution enables the imager to better define normal anatomic structures and establish more precise tumor margins. Magnetic resonance's direct multiplanar imaging capability allows the diagnostician to offer his clinical colleagues a more accurate assessment of the total extent (in three dimensions) of disease and a better map of the spatial relationship of tumors to crucial vessels. This important information aids the clinician in making better informed decisions concerning the appropriate treatment plan (surgery versus radiation, surgical approach, radiation ports). Magnetic resonance's major inadequacy, compared with CT, is suboptimal detection of calcifications and subtle bony changes. Because of this, there are clinical situations when both MRI and CT are required, either to make a more definitive diagnosis or to include (exclude) certain pathology in (from) the differential diagnosis. Although there is considerable overlap in the signal intensity of various lesions, it probably is beyond realistic expectations to seek complete tissue specificity from any imaging tool. Hopefully, MRI spectroscopy will enable us, as imagers, in combination with our basic science colleagues, to take that giant step forward.\r"

Compared to CT, MR consistently shows superior soft tissue definition. The use of direct coronal and sagittal scan planes allows the visualization of intrinsic laryngeal musculature in addition to better defining cranial caudal tumor extension. Thus, MR is now the imaging study of choice for the evaluation of cancer of the larynx. The role of MR can also be extended to replace CT scanning in the evaluation of the laryngeal airway and benign lesions of the larynx.\r"

Without question, MR has improved the diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing neoplasms from inflammatory diseases. This improved discrimination is primarily due to the combination of the superior soft tissue contrast of MRI and the widely disparate T2-relaxation values between the neoplasms and inflammatory processes indigenous to this anatomic area. MR's expanding role as the primary imaging modality for clinical problems in the sinonasal region will accompany the decrease in exam time and increase in spatial resolution. In the past few years there has been a rapid expansion in MRI's utility for a variety of clinical situations in the sinonasal region. This trend should accelerate, especially with the decrease in exam time and increase in spatial resolution that will accompany other expeditious technologic advancements.\r"

Neither of these viruses is thought to be associated with human cancer, but they can cause tumors in rodents. Binding between the RB anti-oncoprotein and the adenovirus or SV40 oncoprotein can be recapitulated in vitro with coimmunoprecipitation mixing assays. These assays have been used to demonstrate that the E7 oncoprotein of the human papilloma virus type-16 can form similar complexes with p105-RB. Human papilloma virus-16 is found associated with approximately 50 percent of cervical carcinomas. These results suggest that these three DNA viruses may utilize similar mechanisms in transformation and implicate RB binding as a possible step in human papilloma virus-associated carcinogenesis.\r"

Eleven specimens from patients whose carotid arteries were reoperated upon were examined. A temporal sequence was noted: with increasing intervals, the relative presence of areas of myointimal hyperplasia tended to decrease, whereas the relative presence of features of atherosclerosis tended to increase. The clinical data and B-mode ultrasound studies performed from one to 190 months after 210 carotid endarterectomies were reviewed. Twenty-seven carotid arteries (12.9 per cent) exhibited hemodynamically significant restenosis. Three ultrasonographic patterns were described: homogenous soft plaque, homogenous hard plaque and heterogenous plaque. A previous correlation between ultrasonographic and pathologic findings showed the three ultrasound patterns to correlate with myointimal hyperplasia, fibrous atherosclerotic plaque and complex atherosclerotic plaque, respectively. Soft plaques were detected earlier than heterogenous plaques (p less than 0.001). Results from serial studies showed progression of soft plaque to hard or heterogenous plaque, or both. Early and late recurrent lesions are the same type of lesion detected at different intervals. Symptoms of cerebral ischemia are more common at the stage of heterogenous plaque (p = 0.02).\r"

The portal vein is mobilized 2 centimeters from the head of the pancreas. The whole pancreas graft includes the splenic artery and the superior mesenteric artery, which are reconstructed. The hepatic graft includes the entire length of the hepatic artery with the celiac axis, and no further reconstruction is required. Using this technique, we have performed nine combined hepatic and whole pancreas procurements; only one liver was not transplanted because of technical complications. When a replaced right hepatic artery is identified from the superior mesenteric artery, we have abandoned the pancreatic retrieval. All combined retrievals have included successful renal retrieval, and the majority have been associated with cardiac retrieval also. Combined hepatic and whole pancreas procurement is feasible with minimal technical complications with the liver or the pancreatic graft and should be standard in most procurements.\r"

  ".W": "The morbidity and mortality of infection in surgical treatment remains substantial. Many principles for the prevention and treatment of surgical infections have been established. Proper selection and preparation of patients and meticulous operative techniques are of primary importance in the prevention of surgical infections. Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is also beneficial when an adequate tissue level is present before and throughout the duration of the procedure. The level attained in the tissues is dependent on many factors that affect the pharmacokinetics of antibiotic distribution and excretion. One factor is protein binding, which alters the fraction of free drug available for diffusion into tissues. However, the singular importance of this effect on the concentration of antibiotics in tissues is minimal. In surgical prophylaxis, the maintenance of antibiotic tissue activity at the sites of potential infection for the duration of the operation is crucial. Failure to provide persistent antibiotic tissue activity throughout the entire procedure results in an increased number of surgical infections. The pharmacokinetics of distribution and the half-life of antibiotics in the serum are directly related to the duration of activity of antibiotic in the tissue. Antibiotics with longer half-lives maintain levels in the tissues for longer periods than do antibiotics with shorter half-lives. The maintenance of the levels of a given antibiotic is similar for all tissues. The application of the pharmacokinetic properties of antibiotics to surgical prophylaxis can provide the surgeon with certainty that adequate coverage and protection with antibiotics are achieved before and throughout the operation.\r"

In these cases, mean growth hormone basal levels obtained 1-2 months after surgery had dropped to levels below 5 ng/mL. In 11 of the patients, the 1-2 months postoperative mean growth hormone basal levels were reduced to less than 3 ng/mL. In these patients, abnormal growth hormone responses to these dynamic tests were not present and mean growth hormone basal levels remained below 3.0 ng/mL during the follow-up period of 1-6 years. In contrast, the six other patients' 1-2 months postoperative mean growth hormone basal levels were between 3 and 5 ng/mL. Of these, four presented abnormal responses in at least one of these three dynamic tests 1-2 months postoperatively, and three exhibited a rise in growth hormone basal levels after intervals of 1-3.5 years after surgery. It is concluded that the restoration of normal growth hormone response to the dynamic tests is better related to the value of the mean growth hormone basal levels obtained 1-2 months postoperatively being less than 3 ng/mL rather than it is to the conventional criterion of the growth hormone basal levels being less than 5 ng/mL.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsatile blood flow within the normal carotid sinus involves at least two distinct components. That near the flow divider is laminar and antegrade, whereas a boundary layer separation zone in the posterolateral aspect exhibits transient blood flow reversal. It is now possible to document these flow velocity components using pulsed Doppler ultrasound methods. When atherosclerosis develops, it preferentially involves the posterolateral bulb region, obliterating the normal configuration of the sinus with consequent loss of the flow separation zone. It was therefore hypothesized that if flow separation could be detected, it should be predictive of a normal angiogram. To assess this, we evaluated 20 symptomatic patients and two with only bruits found by duplex scanning to have flow separation in either one or both carotid bulbs and who also underwent cerebral angiography. Initial diagnoses were stroke in seven, reversible ischemic neurologic deficit in one, transient ischemic attack in 12, and bruit in two. Flow separation was bilateral in 13 patients (59%). There were 15 patients with symptoms in the territory of a carotid bulb exhibiting flow separation. By angiography, of the 35 bulbs with boundary layer separation, 27 (77%) were normal, with the remainder showing lesions that reduced the diameter of the vessel by 20% or less. Final diagnoses of the 15 patients with symptoms ipsilateral to a carotid sinus exhibiting flow separation were fibromuscular disease in two, lacunar stroke in three, dissection in two, subclavian steal in one, cardiogenic embolus in three, migraine in one, hyperventilation syndrome in one, kink of the mid-internal carotid artery in one, and no diagnosis in one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results from this study group were compared with those from a control group of 150 neurological patients without cerebrovascular disease. Of 275 patients from both groups specifically tested by the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test, 34% of the study group were seropositive compared with 18% of the controls (chi 2 = 7.7, p less than 0.01). Fifty-four percent of the patients with a positive fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test underwent a cerebrospinal fluid examination; meningovascular syphilis was detected in one (0.4%) of these. This patient was a homosexual male with antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus; a second patient, with possible meningovascular syphilis, also had antibodies to this virus. Despite the relatively high rate of syphilis seropositivity noted in our study group, syphilis was not found to be a common cause of cerebrovascular disease; therefore, routine screening is seen to be of low diagnostic yield. Attention to patients who are at higher risk for syphilitic infection, patients with clinical features suggestive of meningovascular syphilis, and the proper choice of serologic studies can help make the assessment of syphilis seropositivity more clinically appropriate and cost effective.\r"

Plasma beta-endorphin levels rose significantly following surgery in control dogs but were unaffected by spinal ischemia. On the other hand, a significant increase in cerebrospinal fluid beta-endorphin concentration occurred after spinal ischemia, while surgical stress had no significant effect. Thus, the origins of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid beta-endorphin may be different, with the former secreted from the hypophysis and the latter from nervous tissue. Observed changes in cerebrospinal fluid beta-endorphin concentration could be related to the ischemic lesion of nervous tissue while the changes in plasma levels may reflect general stressing factors such as the surgery in our experiments.\r"

A PIN-diode-switched NMR experiment allowed the acquisition of an arterial as well as a cerebral fluorine-19 signal proportional to concentration vs. time in a 1.89 T magnet. Mean +/- SD blood:brain partition coefficients for Freon-22 were estimated at 0.93 +/- 0.08 for gray matter and 0.77 +/- 0.12 for white matter. Using maximum-likelihood curve fitting, estimates of mean +/- SD resting cerebral blood flow were 50 +/- 19 ml/100 g-min for gray matter and 5.0 +/- 2.0 ml/100 g-min for white matter. Hypercapnia produced the expected increases in gray and white matter blood flow. The physiologic effects of Freon-22, including an increase in cerebral blood flow itself with administration of 40% by volume, may limit its use as an indicator. Nevertheless, the NMR techniques described demonstrate the feasibility of fluorine-19-labeled compounds as cerebral blood flow indicators and the promise for their use in humans.\r"

None of these patients had any clinical evidence of HIV infection. Absorption of these patients' sera with B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) positive for the serologic specificities DR3, DR4 (Dw4, Dw10, Dw14), and DR5 resulted in EIAs that were negative for HIV. Treatment of the B-LCL with an anti-DR monoclonal antibody (L243) interfered with the absorption of the serum sample by B-LCL. This indicates that the initial false-positive EIA results may be due to HLA antibodies. Furthermore, it was shown that these HLA antibodies are not limited in specificity to the HLA type of the host cell used in the preparation of the EIA reagents, but can consist of other DR specificities.\r"

Single adsorptions with solid-state synthetic A and B substances greatly reduced or eliminated anti-A and -B titers but did not adsorb known platelet antibodies. Unadsorbed and adsorbed serum samples were crossmatched with ABO-compatible and -incompatible platelets by a radioimmunoassay employing 125I-labeled monoclonal antibodies specific for human gamma, mu, and C3d antigens. IgG and IgM crossmatch incompatibility was directly related to ABO alloantibody titers greater than or equal to 64. The use of adsorbed serum in the crossmatch eliminated or greatly reduced incompatible results that were due to ABO alloagglutinins alone, thus allowing the reliable detection of platelet and/or HLA antibodies.\r"

Buffy coat cells were frozen at controlled rate in 10% DMSO, and stored in liquid nitrogen for 6 to 49 d. Engraftment (WBC greater than 1000/uL x 3 d) occurred from 13 to 37 d post BMT. In 4 of 4 cases in which data are available, donor origin of engraftment was documented, 1 with cytogenetics, 2 with red cell typing, and 4 with restriction fragment length polymorphisms. 3 patients are alive and well 21, 21, and 42 months post BMT.

This increase in cardiac index was largely a result of increase in heart rate (from 88 +/- 20 beats/min to 104 +/- 24 beats/min, p less than 0.05), because stroke volume index demonstrated only a small change (from 23 +/- 10 ml/m2 to 27 +/- 11 ml/m2, p not significant) in spite of a significant fall in systemic vascular resistance from 1992 +/- 717 dynes.sec.cm-5 to 1361 +/- 524 dynes.sec.cm-5 (p less than 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (from 89 +/- 15 mm Hg to 80 +/- 17 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). No change was seen during dopexamine infusion in systolic blood pressure, right and left ventricular filling pressures, and LV stroke work index. Both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were impaired at baseline in most patients. Dopexamine administration resulted in a significant increase (2x coefficient of variation) in renal blood flow in two patients only. Mean values of both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate did not show significant change (485 +/- 183 ml/min vs 563 +/- 221 ml/min and 89 +/- 39 ml/min vs 93 +/- 34 ml/min, respectively, p not significant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This report reviews recent pacemaker technological advances as they apply to infants, children, and adolescents. Indications for pacemaker implantation in children have evolved since the 1984 Joint Task Force Guidelines. Recent data show that pacemaker implantation should be strongly considered in patients who have (1) asymptomatic congenital complete AV block with a mean heart rate less than 50 beats/min or other evidence of junctional instability; (2) congenital AV block with long QT interval; or (3) congenital long QT syndrome with bradyarrhythmias, or when conventional beta-blocker therapy is unsuccessful. Permanent pacemaker implantation is not necessarily an effective prophylactic measure against sudden death in patients following their operation who are receiving drug therapy for atrial tachyarrhythmias, and so is not absolutely indicated. New developments in lead technology have made transvenous lead systems more feasible for pediatric use. Because epicardial leads are required for small infants and for cosmetic reasons in some older children, design improvements are needed to enhance epicardial lead performance. Rate-responsive pacing is an acceptable alternative to dual-chamber pacing for augmenting exercise tolerance, and for children with sinus node dysfunction it is the preferred pacing mode. Pacemakers with automatic antitachycardia capabilities and with noninvasive electrophysiology features are valuable in children with atrial tachyarrhythmias. New data suggest that chronic atrial pacing also may be effective in controlling atrial tachyarrhythmias. New developments in pacemaker systems for the young parallel those for the older population, but differences between adult and pediatric patients demand ongoing increased participation by pediatric cardiologists.\r"

Data presented here demonstrate that the definition of ACE inhibition depends on the methodology used, with different results obtained with different substrates. We have developed a method that provides accurate and precise determinations of \"true\" angiotensin levels and in vivo ACE activity was estimated by measuring the plasma angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio. Since the initial interruption of angiotensin II production by an ACE inhibitor stimulates renal renin release, the response can be quantitated by measuring changes in plasma levels of angiotensin I. The actual state of the renin-angiotensin system during ACE inhibition is represented by the plasma angiotensin II level. When ACE inhibition is no longer complete, increased angiotensin I levels bring the system back toward initial angiotensin II concentrations.\r"

  ".U": "89148085\r", 
  ".W": "A blood pressure (BP) recording is, strictly speaking, only relevant for the circumstances under which it is measured. A reading that is truly representative of the average pressure is difficult to obtain because of the great variability of pressure in any person. The use to which BP readings are put should be defined, whether for characterizing populations, assessing antihypertensive agents, or managing individual patients. The limitations of any technique must be taken into account. Intra-arterial measurement of BP is the most accurate method, capable of giving a continuous picture. Indirect recordings give a rough estimate of intra-arterial pressure but less information about the relationship between individual subjects and their environment. Ambulatory indirect BP recordings with automated devices compare favorably in accuracy with conventional sphygmomanometers but contain more accurate characterization of an individual's BP during normal daily activities. The ultimate choice of method depends on what information is required in the particular circumstances.\r"

Its onset and duration of action and the dose-response relationship of its antihypertensive effect have been evaluated. The results of these studies show that 20 mg of benazepril once daily lowers blood pressure by a clinically important amount, which was statistically superior to placebo in three double-blind studies. Doses as low as 10 mg once daily may be effective in individual patients. Doses of 40 and 80 mg once daily have been evaluated and provide small further reductions beyond those seen with the 20 mg dose. Adverse effects are uncommon and generally not dose related. Thiazide diuretics add to the antihypertensive action of benazepril, which has little effect on blood chemistry, apart from a slight rise in serum potassium.\r"

  ".W": "This article emphasizes the importance of testing baroreceptor and cardiopulmonary receptor control of circulation during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment in hypertensives, because removal of angiotensin II-dependent stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system could impair reflex blood pressure homeostasis. In essential hypertensive subjects, the sympathetic vasoconstriction that occurs in skeletal muscle after deactivation of cardiopulmonary receptors was reduced after short-term or prolonged administration of the ACE inhibitor, captopril. However, another sympathetic target of the cardiopulmonary reflex, that is, renin release, was unaltered by both short-term and prolonged administration of captopril. Furthermore, the blood pressure and heart rate influences of arterial baroreceptors were preserved or even enhanced after administration of captopril. Thus important reflex mechanisms for cardiovascular homeostasis are not adversely affected by ACE inhibition, which preserves blood pressure levels during gravity challenges or exercise. Preliminary data suggest that this may be even more evident for benazepril.\r"

  ".W": "Although early studies suggested little role for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in older hypertensive patients, more careful evaluation has confirmed their efficacy and good tolerability. Although the elderly tend to have low plasma renin levels, the fall in blood pressure after ACE inhibitors is at least as great (and in several studies greater) than in younger age groups. Because several ACE inhibitors, including captopril and enalaprilat, are eliminated by the kidneys, there are predictable age-related effects on pharmacokinetics. Reduced renal clearance will contribute, at least in part, to the enhanced intensity and duration of action seen in elderly patients. However, not all the effects of age on the kinetics and dynamics of ACE inhibitors are predictable. Studies with perindopril and benazepril in the elderly confirm the efficacy of this group of drugs but highlight other pharmacokinetic differences. ACE inhibitors are effective in reducing blood pressure and can be considered for wider use in elderly hypertensives.\r"

  ".U": "89148091\r", 
  ".W": "Several immunologic approaches to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been reported, involving most of the proteins and peptides of the biochemical cascade: renin, substrate, angiotensins, and converting enzyme. None as yet has involved blockade of angiotensin II receptors. Earlier and more recent studies used passive transfer of heterologous antibodies or active immunization against RAS proteins and peptides. Passive transfers have been performed with both polyclonal antibodies and now with specific monoclonal immunoglobulins. The latter are better defined in affinity, quantity, and capacity to bind and thus inhibit the biologic activity of the antigen. Active immunization produced long-term blockade of part or all of the biologic activity of the system. The immunopathologic consequences of the use of antibodies raised against a self-antigen could be of interest in defining the predominant site of storage and secretion of the relevant protein and hence the respective roles of different tissues in the production of specific proteins in, for example, the vascular pulmonary bed for converting enzyme and renal arterial tree for renin. In all cases immunologic methods offer in vivo experimental models of short- or long-term RAS blockade that could be compared with pharmacologic methods, such as converting-enzyme inhibition, angiotensin II antagonists, and renin inhibitors.\r"

Moreover, a question has arisen as to whether a once- or twice-daily dosing schedule is preferable. To address these issues, a multicenter trial was conducted with the objective of obtaining long-term (48 weeks) experience with enalapril in 142 patients with CHF. A subgroup of patients (n = 88) were randomized to receive enalapril in a dosing schedule of either 20 mg once daily or 10 mg twice daily. Of the overall group, 96 patients completed the 48 weeks of follow-up. Improvement in New York Heart Association functional class, exercise duration and left ventricular ejection fraction was observed. Improvement in clinical status was seen in 68% of all patients, whereas conditions in 5% worsened with enalapril therapy. The most frequent adverse experiences were dizziness and hypotension. There were no obvious differences between the effects of the once- and twice-daily dosing regimens, with doses of 20 mg/day and 2.5 to 15 mg/day being given to about 70 and 30% of patients, respectively. Enalapril appears to provide well-tolerated and effective long-term therapy for CHF.\r"

Determinations of the hemodynamic indexes of left ventricular function during hemodynamic studies also provide information regarding prognosis of patients with acute or chronic heart failure. In patients with stable chronic heart failure, correlations between the changes in hemodynamics after initiation of vasodilator therapy and subsequent changes in the clinical status and exercise tolerance are poor; thus, the value of hemodynamic studies for vasodilator therapy in patients with stable chronic heart failure is limited.\r"

Data have been collected from 546 patients treated with enalapril for up to 9 months in clinical trials other than the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study. Results in patients treated with enalapril (n = 193) or placebo (n = 195) in double-blind, controlled clinical trials show that the incidences of death, serious adverse experiences, and adverse experiences requiring discontinuation of double-blind therapy, as well as the overall incidence of such experiences, were similar in the 2 groups. However, certain adverse experiences that are related to the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors were seen more often after enalapril than after placebo treatment. Dizziness and hypotension were the most frequent adverse experiences reported in patients with heart failure treated with enalapril. The most frequent laboratory adverse experiences were increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. hyperkalemia was also seen in patients receiving enalapril. It is possible to identify patients at risk of these experiences before initiating treatment with enalapril and to take certain measures (such as withholding or reducing the dose of diuretic drugs and discontinuing potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretic drugs) to reduce the likelihood that hypotension, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, or hyperkalemia will occur. Angioedema, a recognized adverse effect of ACE inhibitors, was not seen in the clinical trials reviewed here. Cough , another recognized adverse effect of these agents, was seen infrequently and rarely resulted in the discontinuation of enalapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Significant changes in most parameters were present at 24 hours. A dose-response relation for most parameters was noted. Over a 3-month period, 47 patients were followed up, with improvement in functional capacity and symptomatic status. Metabolic parameters did not change over time, although 26% showed evidence of reversible renal dysfunction. Only 3 patients (6.4%) required discontinuation because of adverse effects. A subgroup of patients reassessed at 3 months demonstrated maintenance of hemodynamic effects.

Digital subtraction aortography was performed before and after valvuloplasty in 50 patients. The ratio of left ventricular to aortic contrast density during aortography was analyzed by videodensitometric techniques. A time-density curve was obtained by placing a 30 X 30 pixel region of interest over the aortogram and the left ventricular cavity. The ratio of left ventricular to aortic density at peak aortic density defined the videodensitometric ratio. Independent visual interpretation was also assessed and compared to videodensitometric methods. Quantitatively, no significant change in AR could be demonstrated in the mean videodensitometric ratio before or after balloon aortic valvuloplasty (0.33 +/- 0.21 vs 0.37 +/- 0.25, p = 0.07). Ten (20%) of the patients had a greater than or equal to 0.10 increase, and 4 (8%) patients a greater than or equal to 0.10 decrease in the AR ratio.

In 2 fetuses referred because of a family history of dilated cardiomyopathy in previous siblings, echocardiographic abnormalities were absent on a first examination performed at 20 weeks of gestation. This suggested that a normal fetal echocardiogram in a midtrimester fetus does not always rule out the subsequent development of dilated cardiomyopathy. However, all fetuses followed serially developed some abnormality later in pregnancy. Only 2 neonates survived, 1 of whom required a heart transplant during infancy. Death from cardiac failure occurred in 1 fetus and 3 neonates. This study demonstrates that dilated cardiomyopathy may develop during fetal life and might be diagnosed by echocardiography if serial studies are performed. Dilated cardiomyopathy presenting prenatally appears to have a poor prognosis.\r"

Recurrent pleural effusions represent one of the main clinical features in this entity, and can often lead to false diagnoses. Determination of pancreatic enzyme activity, as well as the combination of ultrasonography, computerized tomography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), enable the establishment of the diagnosis. A complete pancreatic evaluation is the rationale for an adequate and efficient therapy which should always aim at a focal assentation.\r"

  ".W": "The use of paracentesis has recently been reproposed as a safe and effective alternative to diuretics for management of ascites. We have investigated the clinical and biochemical effects of large-volume paracentesis in 19 cirrhotics with tense ascites, and the relative changes in the hormones involved in sodium and water renal handling. Plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PA), and arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels and conventional liver and renal function tests were measured before and after 1, 2, and 7 days after the paracentesis. No complications were observed, but patients regained 37% of the weight lost after 1 wk. Percent weight regained was significantly and directly correlated with PA concentration measured before the paracentesis. No changes were recorded after paracentesis in biochemical and clinical data, except for a significant drop in diastolic blood pressure. No changes in AVP levels were observed. A significant increase in PA occurred after paracentesis, with a maximum peak after 48 h. The increase in PA was not accompanied by changes in PRA, but was associated with a reduction of urinary sodium excretion. A relevant fraction of body aldosterone was confined to the ascitic fluid. We conclude that the clinical results of a large-volume paracentesis can be predicted in part on the basis of PA measurement, and that removal of ascites is followed by an increase of PA of uncertain origin and effectiveness.\r"

Culture-negative episodes of peritonitis occur at rates of up to 20%, and in part may reflect inadequate culturing techniques of peritoneal effluent. Through a large, prospective study, the improved sensitivity of a blood culture system, when compared with a standard plate technique (P = 0.001), for the detection of bacterial growth in 67 episodes of CAPD peritonitis is demonstrated. Improved recognition of infections caused by gram-positive organisms, primarily Staphylococcus epidermidis, was especially significant using the blood culture system (P = 0.0001). Because of improved sensitivity and a decreased time to organism identification, particularly with infections caused by S epidermidis, the most common cause of bacterial peritonitis in CAPD patients, we suggest that a blood culture system be the standard means of culturing peritoneal fluid in CAPD patients with peritonitis. The lysis-centrifugation system of culturing peritoneal fluid is also discussed in comparison with the blood culture system.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the incidence, risk factors, and course of acute renal failure (ARF) following bone marrow transplantation (BMT), a retrospective analysis of 272 patients receiving transplants at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center during 1986 was undertaken. The patients were divided into three groups: group 1, hemodialysis requiring ARF; group 2, mild renal insufficiency (doubling of serum creatinine, Scr, but no dialysis); group 3, relatively normal post-BMT renal function (no doubling of Scr). Fifty-three percent of patients at least doubled their Scr (Groups 1 and 2), and 24% required dialysis. The degree of renal functional impairment had a dramatic impact on patient mortality rates (84%, 37%, and 17% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Jaundice (bilirubin greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL), weight gain (greater than or equal to 2.0 kg), amphotericin B use, and a pretransplant Scr greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL were independently associated with the subsequent development of dialysis-requiring ARF (P less than 0.001; relative risks, 3.0 to 7.7). Neither aminoglycoside/vancomycin/cyclosporine A use nor acute graft v host disease correlated with the development of ARF. A mismatched graft was a significant risk factor for ARF by univariate but not by multivariate analysis. Within 48 hours before doubling the Scr, 63% of group 1 patients had positive blood cultures and 39% developed hypotension. Of the 26 group 1 patients who had urine Na concentrations measured, 85% had values less than or equal to 40 mEq/L. Autopsy kidney specimens provided no clear explanation for ARF in the vast majority of patients in group 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The review describes the dramatic change in prevalence of the different laboratory methods for measuring serum sodium over the past decade, and emphasizes the need for clinicians to be familiar with the methods of their clinical laboratory in order to properly interpret a reported serum sodium determination.

This fact, coupled with increasing concern for the safety and efficacy of the digitalis glycosides, has stimulated an intense search for new oral cardiotonic agents suitable for chronic administration. Despite the ability of many phosphodiesterase inhibiting agents to affect profound hemodynamic improvements acutely after oral or intravenous administration, none of the four agents here reviewed in 30 clinical trials has been adequately proven to provide benefit over conventional long-term therapy of severe heart failure. The four drugs to have undergone long-term clinical trials are amrinone, milrinone, enoximone (MDL 17043), and piroximone (MDL 19,025). For amrinone, inefficacy was revealed through carefully designed, placebo-controlled studies despite initial enthusiasm generated by open uncontrolled trials. Enoximone has suffered rapid attenuation of its hemodynamic effectiveness in most studies, and piroximone failed in its only long-term trial. Therefore, final judgment on most of these agents must await completion of controlled clinical trials, and any initial optimism stimulated by the current uncontrolled studies should be met with reservation.\r"

A comparative study with respect to hypoglossal nucleus disclosed the possibility of hypoplasia of the hypoglossal nucleus as part of this syndrome. This finding led us to propose that hypoplasia of the nucleus is one of the causes of polyhydramnios, based on the lack of swallowing activity. Moreover, ectopic cross-striated muscle fibers and an increase of muscle spindles were noted in tongue. The findings, particularly the neuropathologic one, provide further insight into the pathogenesis of the syndrome.\r"

These include 1) increased metabolism of dexamethasone, 2) decreased sensitivity of pituitary glucocorticoid receptors to dexamethasone, 3) hyperresponsivity of the adrenal gland to ACTH stimulation, and 4) increased central drive of the pituitary from hypothalamic/limbic structures that overrides the action of the dexamethasone. A critical review of the literature suggests that the last hypothesis is most closely supported by the data. Despite this conclusion, factors other than depression may be involved in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction.\r"

However, published case reports of the two syndromes indicate differences in mode of onset, signs and symptoms, and outcome. Lethal catatonia often begins with extreme psychotic excitement, which, if persistent, can lead to fever, exhaustion, and death. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome begins with severe extrapyramidally induced muscle rigidity. Because lethal catatonia often requires neuroleptic treatment and neuroleptic malignant syndrome necessitates immediate cessation of neuroleptics, their early clinical differentiation is important.\r"

  ".W": "The human malaria parasite, P. falciparum, exhibits cytoadherence properties whereby infected erythrocytes containing mature parasite stages bind to endothelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Another property of cytoadherence, \"rosetting,\" or the binding of uninfected erythrocytes around an infected erythrocyte, has been demonstrated with a simian malaria parasite P. fragile which is sequestered in vivo in its natural host, Macaca sinica. In the present study we demonstrate that rosetting occurs in P. falciparum. Rosetting in P. falciparum is abolished by protease treatment and reappears on further parasite growth indicating that, as in P. fragile, it is mediated by parasite induced molecules which are protein in nature. P. vivax and P. cynomolgi, which are not sequestered in the host, did not exhibit rosetting. Rosetting thus appears to be a specific property of cytoadherence in malaria parasites.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated whether thrombospondin plays a role in the binding of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes to C32 melanoma cells. Twelve patient isolates bound variably to melanoma cells, with good correlation between the degree of binding to cells and binding to thrombospondin. With a synchronous preparation of asexual parasites, acquisition of the capacity to bind to thrombospondin occurred at the same parasite stage as binding to melanoma cells. Development of parasites to trophozoites and schizonts correlated with binding of parasitized erythrocytes to thrombospondin and melanoma cells. The infected erythrocyte receptor for thrombospondin was destroyed by mild trypsinization, as was the receptor for melanoma cells. Although these results suggest similarity in the melanoma cell receptor and thrombospondin receptor for infected cells, other results showed that thrombospondin cannot alone be the melanoma cell receptor. Binding to other melanoma cell lines did not correlate with thrombospondin secretion: the RPMI 8252 and G361 cell lines bound few or no infected cells, yet secreted 50-100% as much thrombospondin as C32 cells. Iodinated thrombospondin bound in similar amounts to C32 cells and to noncytoadherent C361 melanoma cells. Binding and nonbinding melanoma cells did not differ in quantity of surface thrombospondin by radioimmunoassay. Thus, although purified, immobilized, thrombospondin binds parasitized erythrocytes, expression of thrombospondin alone on melanoma cells is not sufficient to mediate adherence.\r"

Ferritin conjugated antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated IgG were found inside parasite cytoplasmic vesicles. Nonspecific IgG that did not bind to the external membrane was not internalized by the parasite. The ratio of 3H-protein A labeled: specific IgG internalization by parasites in the exponential growth phase (95% epimastigotes) was much smaller than that of parasites in the late stationary growth phase (38% trypomastigotes). Antibodies bound to the latter parasite forms almost disappeared from their outer membranes after 12 hr incubation at 27 degrees C. Results of experiments in which membrane bound antibodies were removed by an excess of pronase showed that only small amounts of radiolabeled IgG were found inside the parasites. The fate of immunoglobulins that vanished from external membrane receptors and did not accumulate inside the cells was explained by experiments in which the supernatants of IgG-3H-protein A labeled parasites were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA). In these, membrane-bound antibodies were taken in and degraded by the parasites as increased amounts of free radiolabel appeared in the supernatants as functions of incubation time and parasite stage.\r"

VLIA contained an outer limiting membrane and had a buoyant density of 1.17-1.20 g/ml in a sucrose gradient. The DNA genome of VLIA was estimated to be greater than 150 kilobase (kb) pairs and carried repetitive sequences. An 8.6 kb pair cloned probe (psb-8.6) and a 2.2 kb pair cloned probe (psb-2.2) of VLIA detected specific sequences in DNA of VLIA infected cells, but not in DNA of uninfected NIH/3T3 cells. By Southern blot hybridization analysis, VLIA was distinct from all known members of human herpes virus, from vaccinia virus, monkey herpes virus saimiri (HVS), and mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Using synthetic primers with the VLIA specific DNA sequences and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we detected VLIA sequences in DNA isolated from 7 out of 10 patients with AIDS. VLIA infection was identified in spleen, liver, brain, lymph node, Kaposi's sarcoma tissues, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these patients, but not in 5 different organs and a tumor from 5 subjects without AIDS. Antiserum raised against VLIA in rabbit positively immunostained brain and lymph node tissues from these AIDS patients.\r"

Today's combinations of cleaners, alcohol, and either iodophores or chlorhexidine have emerged from previous eras characterized by the use of metallic compounds, halogen compounds, and tincture of iodine. Published guidelines are important but must be looked upon as current consensus rather than standard practice.\r"

Of 50 patients, 25 received anesthesia and 25 receive intravenous sedation. There were transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure after tracheal intubation in the anesthetized patients, followed by significant and sustained decreases below baseline values once steady state anesthesia was attained. Arterial oxygenation was significantly improved in anesthetized patients. There were no serious complications due to anesthesia, but the small sample size limited the power of the study to detect differences in morbidity or mortality. Patients strongly preferred anesthesia. These results show that general anesthesia is feasible in patients undergoing interventional cardiac catheterization during acute myocardial infarction, when pain, anxiety or agitation do not respond adequately to conventional measures.\r"

To produce a wide range of blood flows, we injected lidocaine 1%, lidocaine 1% plus octapressin (0.03 IU.ml-1), and lidocaine 1% plus epinephrine (5 micrograms.ml-1) subcutaneously into three separate sites on the flank of each animal (N = 6). Laser Doppler flow measurements were made before and 10 minutes after injection Subcutaneous injection of lidocaine tended to increase cutaneous blood flow (96 +/- 13 to 153 +/- 30 mV, mean +/- SE, P = 0.09). Blood flow tended to decrease after injection of lidocaine with epinephrine (101 +/- 13 to 57 +/- 10 mV, P = 0.03) or octapressin (108 +/- 20 to 58 +/- 11 mV, P = 0.08). Laser Doppler measurements were higher after the injection of plain lidocaine than after that of lidocaine with either epinephrine or octapressin (P = 0.004). A standard incision was performed at each site and blood loss measured over the subsequent 10 minutes. Laser Doppler measurements correlated with the amount of bleeding from the surgical incision (R = 0.69, P less than 0.001). We conclude that the laser Doppler is a useful tool for evaluating the ability of subcutaneously injected local anesthetics (vasodilators) or vasoconstrictors to alter bleeding from skin incisions.\r"

PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 36 patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis, and without active infection or left ventricular mural thrombus. INTERVENTIONS: Percutaneous transluminal dilatation of the aortic valve until the peak gradient was reduced by 50% or a maximal balloon size was used. Hemodynamic measurements taken before and after dilatation. MEASUREMENTS and Main Results: Thirty-three patients had a successful dilatation. Eighty-nine percent (95% confidence interval [CI]. 74% to 97%) improved symptomatically at 2 weeks, but by 26 weeks only 56% (CI, 35% to 76%) remained improved (P = 0.0078). Mortality rates were high at 8 (9%) and 26 (28%) weeks. Predictors of adverse events included left ventricular ejection fraction (P = 0.04, r = 0.46), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (P = 0.048, r = 0.65), pulmonary vascular resistance (P = 0.008, r = 0.69), and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (P = 0.009, r = 0.43) at 8 weeks and all these factors except left ventricular ejection fraction at 26 weeks. These clinical outcomes were unrelated to other cardiac or pulmonary diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic improvement is only temporary in many patients undergoing balloon aortic valvuloplasty, and the mortality rate in the mid-term follow-up period is high. Valve surgery remains the treatment of choice for aortic stenosis in the adult.\r"

INTERVENTIONS: We listened for wheezing on maximal forced exhalation. Wheezing was defined as a continuous sound with a musical quality. Methacholine challenge testing was done. The concentration of methacholine required to produce a 20% fall in baseline FEV1 (PC20) of less than 8 mg/mL was considered a positive test for asthma.

The major advantages of the technique include high-resolution capability, portable instrumentation, lack of ionizing radiation, and relative affordability. Prognosis in infants with IVH relates to the mechanisms of brain injury, the most important of which are prior hypoxic-ischemic insults, posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, and periventricular hemorrhagic infarction. The last of these is most critical and it is now clear that careful quantitative assessment of the ultrasonographic appearance of the periventricular parenchyma in the infant with IVH during the acute period of illness is of major value in estimating outcome. Prevention of IVH remains the most important goal. Prenatal interventions include prevention of premature birth (currently a very elusive goal in the United States), transportation of the premature infant to a tertiary facility in utero rather than after birth (an approach of proven value), prenatal administration of phenobarbital or vitamin K (initially promising data that require confirmation and amplification), and optimal management of labor and delivery. Postnatal interventions include careful resuscitation of newborns, correction of fluctuating cerebral blood flow velocity, correction or prevention of other major hemodynamic disturbances, and correction of abnormalities of coagulation. Of these interventions the use of muscle paralysis to correct fluctuating cerebral blood flow velocity has shown the most striking benefit vis-a-vis prevention of IVH. Postnatal pharmacological interventions that have been studied in detail include the use of phenobarbital, indomethacin, ethamsylate, and vitamin E. No single agent among this group has been shown consistently to lead to a decrease in incidence and severity of IVH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study involved 58 patients with common or classical migraine who were treated in a double-blind randomized study over a period of 7 months, while the effectiveness of prophylactic treatment was recorded in headache diaries that were subjected to time series analysis. VEPs were recorded at the beginning of a 2-month baseline period without treatment, after 4 months of treatment, and at the end of a 3-month washout period. At baseline, migraine patients had significantly higher VEP amplitudes and longer latencies than did a group of 87 healthy control subjects. Patients were separated by statistical analysis into responders and nonresponders to each prophylactic treatment. Nifedipine had no effects on the frequency, intensity, and duration of migraine attacks, nor on amplitude and latency of the VEPs. In contrast, the use of beta blockers resulted in a significant decrease in VEP amplitude, both in responders and nonresponders, whereas VEP latency remained unchanged. VEP amplitudes returned to the initial values at follow-up in the nonresponders, but stayed at lower levels in responders. Beta blockers thus appear to have a significant effect on the increased excitability of the visual system in patients with migraine, although their action is not directly related to their reduction of migraine frequency.\r"

Neuropathological correlates in two autopsied members of this family consisted of extracellular hyaline eosinophilic, congophilic amyloid plaques in decreasing order of frequency in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and substantia nigra, and atrophy and gliosis of the basal ganglia and substantia nigra. The extracellular plaques did not stain with antibody raised against the prion protein nor with two separate anti-amyloid A4 antibodies. The combination of dominantly inherited dementia with parkinsonism and extracellular plaques in this distribution that are amyloid and prion protein antibody negative has not been previously reported and thus may represent a new neurological genetic disorder.\r"

All patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis and normal control subjects were analyzed for the concanavalin A suppressor assay, mitogen stimulation, and phenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, serum was analyzed for interleukin-2 levels. Results of mitogen stimulation studies did not distinguish the groups. Concanavalin A-induced suppression was significantly decreased in the patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (p less than 0.01). Phenotyping of fresh cells showed an elevated CD4: CD8 ratio in the patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. Neither phenotyping nor concanavalin A-induced suppression correlated with or predicted the degree of disability, but the serum levels of interleukin-2 correlated inversely with disability (p less than 0.01) and directly with a poor prognosis after 18 months of observation (p less than 0.05). Serum levels of interleukin-2 decreased as the disease progressed.\r"

These signs are believed to be due to high venous pressures causing stasis and capillary rupture. A \"fear response\" that produces a strong Valsalva maneuver is thought to be necessary for their development. The lower torso seems to be protected, and previously this was thought to be due to its superior system of valves. We present here ultrasonographic evidence that the inferior vena cava is compressed or obliterated during a Valsalva maneuver, and propose that this compression protects the lower torso during traumatic asphyxia.\r"

  ".W": "The guidelines developed by the Adult Treatment Panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program identified low density lipoprotein (LDL) as the major atherogenic lipoprotein, and high levels of LDL-cholesterol as the primary target for cholesterol-lowering therapy. Low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol were recognized as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. This report reexamines in depth the recommendations of the Adult Treatment Panel on HDL-cholesterol. Two major questions are discussed: (1) Should HDL-cholesterol levels be measured in all adults, as recommended for total cholesterol? (2) Should patients found to have a low serum HDL [corrected]-cholesterol level (less than 35 mg/dL [less than 0.91 mmol/L]) enter medical therapy to raise the level? The guidelines of the Adult Treatment Panel are reaffirmed as appropriate from the current perspective. These guidelines recommend that HDL-cholesterol levels be determined in patients deemed to be at high risk for coronary heart disease and suggest that HDL measurement is optional for individuals with borderline-high total levels. The guidelines of the Adult Treatment Panel recommend that low HDL-cholesterol levels be raised mainly by hygienic means (ie, smoking cessation, weight loss, aerobic exercise). When drug therapy is required for high LDL-cholesterol levels in the presence of low HDL levels, cholesterol-lowering drugs that concomitantly raise HDL should be given first priority.\r"

Many of the studies were limited by small sample size, use of drugs out of the range of normal administration, failure to control for known confounders for neuropsychological evaluation, or lack of a crossover design. As a result, one needs caution in drawing conclusions on this topic. Nevertheless, given the widespread use of beta-blockers and the frequent allegations about their relative side effect profiles, it is appropriate to summarize the results of these disparate studies. Across all beta-blockers and all cognitive domains, the drugs led to improved functioning in 16% of observations and worsened functioning in 17%, with no significant effect in the rest. Memory, learning, and abstraction have been studied less frequently. The perceptual motor cognitive domain was the most widely studied and was frequently affected by these drugs. There was no consistent evidence of a trend for lipophilic drugs to impair this domain more than lipophobic drugs. There is some evidence that these drugs have a positive effect on complex task performance. The drugs also seem to increase sedation; however, in these studies there was no evidence for a differential effect across lipophilic vs lipophobic drugs.\r"

Recent investigations have shown that bacterial vaginosis, the most common cause of vaginitis symptoms in patients not seen in sexually transmitted disease clinics, has a multifactorial etiology: Gardnerella vaginalis is universally present but is not, per se, the etiologic agent. Diagnosis and treatment are based, therefore, on evidence of a disturbed bacterial ecology as well as the presence of \"clue\" cells that indicate the presence of Gardnerella. Trichomonas vaginitis is usually easy to diagnose, but treatment failures occasionally occur. Some strains of Trichomonas vaginalis may be relatively resistant to metronidazole, and short-course therapy may lead to reinfection from sexual partners. Candida vulvovaginitis, the third major type of vaginitis, is not a sexually transmitted disease and should be viewed as vaginal \"thrush.\" Earlier treatment regimens have been simplified by the introduction of more potent antifungals.\r"

In some studies in patients with heart failure, a decline in renal function occurred more frequently in patients treated with enalapril maleate, a longer-acting agent, than in those treated with captopril, a shorter-acting drug. Patients experiencing a decline in renal function had a number of predisposing hormonal and hemodynamic factors. In one report, these factors included an initial fall in blood pressure that was sustained, lower cardiac output, and a relatively high fixed dose of enalapril that contributed to renal impairment. In a second study, the decline in renal function was most severe in patients with a lower systemic arterial pressure in whom glomerular filtration may have been dependent on angiotensin II. In a third study, intravascular volume depletion and an activated renin-angiotensin system led to reduced renal function. Reduction of angiotensin II level in plasma and tissues by ACE inhibitors decreases systemic vascular resistance and efferent arteriolar tone, which tends to decrease glomerular filtration rate. If compensatory increases in cardiac output are inadequate or preexisting renal impairment or volume depletion is present, renal function will deteriorate. Long-acting ACE inhibitors prolong the decreased efferent arteriolar tone and may compromise cardiac muscle response to catecholamines. The use of shorter-acting agents in patients who exhibit deterioration in renal function may be preferable.\r"

Half the boys also met criteria for conduct disorder. Dextroamphetamine produced immediate and marked improvement in disruptive, overactive behaviors. Fenfluramine had no effect on any behavioral measure at either the low or high dosage. Both drugs decreased levels of urinary norepinephrine, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and vanillylmandelic acid. Fenfluramine, however, also produced a significant decrease in plasma MHPG levels and a larger decrease in urinary norepinephrine levels. It reduced urinary epinephrine levels as well, an effect opposite to that of dextroamphetamine. These findings suggest that different mechanisms of action are involved in the ability of the two drugs to reduce levels of MHPG and vanillylmandelic acid. Fenfluramine increased plasma prolactin levels and decreased platelet serotonin levels. Despite the structural similarity of the two drugs, some common overall effects on catecholamine metabolism, and similar effects on weight, fenfluramine had none of the motor activity or therapeutic effects of dextroamphetamine.\r"

Ejaculation appears to be mediated primarily by alpha-adrenergic fibers. Serotonergic neurotransmission may inhibit the ejaculatory reflex. An understanding of the neurobiological substrate of human sexuality may assist clinicians in choosing psychotropic agents with minimal adverse effects on sexual behavior and may also contribute to the development of pharmacological interventions for sexual difficulties.\r"

Similar studies conducted in the 1980s have reported rates of infection of 1% in seronegative patients. Little morbidity or mortality has been associated with these CMV infections. In contrast, transfusion-transmitted CMV infections in seronegative immunocompromised premature infants and bone marrow transplant recipients have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. Blood transfusion is a less important risk factor in recipients of solid organ transplants. The risk of infection, however, can be reduced by providing blood from CMV-seronegative donors or frozen deglycerolized red blood cells. Leukocyte removal by filtration or centrifugation is also likely to reduce the risk. Prophylaxis with CMV immune globulin can ameliorate the severity of posttransfusion-posttransplant CMV infections.\r"

  ".W": "For some time it has been known that allogeneic blood transfusions have immunologic effects on animal and human recipients. These effects include increased numbers of suppressor T cells, decreased natural killer-cell function, decreased function of macrophages and monocytes, induction of anti-idiotypic antibodies that suppress allogeneic antigen recognition, and decreases in alloreactivity of mononuclear cells in mixed lymphocyte cultures. The meaning of these changes is not clearly understood, nor is the exact clinical importance of these alterations known. However, these decreases in immunologic function may explain a number of clinical consequences some investigators believe are the sequelae of homologous blood transfusions. Clinically important outcomes that are associated with transfusions are improved survival of renal allografts and increased risks of bacterial infection and cancer recurrence after perioperative transfusions. Transfusion of plasma-rich blood components (eg, whole blood) has been specifically associated with earlier cancer recurrence and better renal allograft survival in some patient groups. The new hypothesis that transfusion of stored plasma is a major factor in altering host immune defenses is supported by the observation that patients infected with human immunodeficiency acquired immunodeficiency syndrome more rapidly if they have been transfused with large amounts of plasma. Contrary to previous belief, the transfusion of homologous stored blood plasma may have as great or greater effects on immunity than transfusion of white blood cells. We believe investigation into the immunologic effects of transfusions is likely to have a significant impact on transfusion medicine research and practice over the coming years.\r"

The responsible physician must actively control these procedures, from the point of view of effective component collection and protection of the donor from undesirable procedural reactions, as well as potentially dangerous blood component depletion. The application of similar hemapheretic techniques to patients is quite a different matter. Patients do not have the same tolerance of blood manipulative techniques as do healthy donors. Furthermore, therapeutic component depletions are usually much more radical than the procedures applied to donors. The physician responsible for such therapeutic operations must play an active, consultative role with the clinical physician in discussing the likely efficacy of such treatment, the identification of risk factors, obtaining informed consent, deciding on a schedule of operations, replacement solutions, supplementary therapy, and overall supervision of procedures.\r"

Transfusion-associated GVHD affects the skin, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and most importantly, the bone marrow, and results in death in more than 90% of affected patients. The best means to prevent transfusion-associated GVHD is prophylactic irradiation of blood and components to inactivate contained lymphocytes. A dose of 15 Gy delivered by a self-contained cesium 137 irradiator is sufficient to prevent transfusion-associated GVHD. Engraftment of transfused lymphocytes may occur because of HLA similarity between donor and recipient. The HLA differences, however, then facilitate rejection of the host by the engrafted lymphocytes and thus make easier the development of transfusion-associated GVHD or the Japanese equivalent, postoperative erythroderma.\r"

In previous reports, prostaglandin E (PGE) compounds were found to be increased in inflamed human gallbladders. Prostaglandin synthetase inhibition decreased PGE formation by human gallbladders; however, the relief of symptoms of cholecystitis did not correlate well with the decrease in PGE formation. This suggested that other prostanoids may be involved in cholecystitis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the production of the proinflammatory arachidonic acid metabolite prostacyclin by gallbladders from patients with calculous cholecystitis. The formation of PGE and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), the stable metabolite of prostacyclin, in normal human gallbladder mucosal cells and muscle tissue was compared with that produced by diseased mucosal cells and muscle tissue. Normal human gallbladders produced small amounts of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and no differences in formation rates were evident when muscle tissue was compared with mucosal cells. Diseased gallbladders produced significantly greater amounts of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha than did normal gallbladders, and diseased gallbladder muscle produced approximately four times greater amounts of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha than did diseased gallbladder mucosa. Prostacyclin formation is increased in diseased human gallbladders and may be an important mediator of the inflammatory changes of cholecystitis.\r"

Long-term local control has been achieved in a wide range of malignant tumors, notably sarcomas of bone and soft tissue and adenocarcinomas in various sites. Complete response and long-term remission, with local control rates between 50% and 70%, have been reported in a number of very large osteogenic sarcomas, soft-tissue sarcomas (particularly neurogenic tumors), melanomas, and adenocarcinomas of the alimentary tract. Malignant salivary gland tumors and carcinoma of the prostate appear to be the most responsive to neutrons, with a high frequency (70% to 90%) of successful remission and significantly improved survival even in advanced stages of disease. The biological mechanisms underlying radioresistance of tumor cells and the rationale for using heavily ionizing particles are described. Neutrons are shown to be a valuable adjunct in managing nonresectable malignant tumors that resist conventional therapy.\r"

The tumor is frequently mistaken for a benign lesion and the delay in diagnosis and final treatment may be responsible for the high local recurrence rate and the low disease-free survival rate. From 1965 to 1982 the combined-modality therapy of amputation and adjuvant isolated regional perfusion with melphalan with or without dactinomycin was used in the treatment of 22 patients with subungual melanoma. Disease was staged according to the M. D. Anderson classification, as follows: stage I (primary melanoma), 11 patients; stage IIIA (in-transit metastases and/or satellitosis), three patients; stage IIIB (regional lymph nodes), seven patients; and stage IIIAB (in-transit metastases and/or satellitosis and regional lymph nodes), one patient. There were no cardiovascular complications and no treatment mortality. During a follow-up of at least 4.5 years, 12 patients (55%) developed distant metastases, including four patients with stage I disease (36%) and eight patients with stage III disease (73%). There were no locoregional recurrences. The median survival was three years (range, 0.5 to 12.5 years) and the overall five-year survival was 40%, with 56% of patients having stage I disease and 27% having stage III disease. The prognosis of subungual melanoma is determined by the stage of the disease. Isolated regional perfusion may prolong disease-free survival in patients with subungual melanoma compared with previously published data.\r"

Auranofin treatment was statistically superior to placebo treatment, according to physician's global assessment and functional scores. A trend in favor of auranofin treatment was seen for each of the other disease parameters studied. Psoriasis worsened in 6 auranofin-treated patients and in 3 placebo-treated patients. The incidence and nature of other side effects were similar to those observed in similar trials of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Both K+ and bradykinin dose-dependently increased [3H]dopamine release. The mean +/- S.E.M. EC50 for K+ was 35.8 +/- 1.2 mM; for bradykinin it was 1.07 +/- 0.23 x 10(-7) M. The characteristics of the bradykinin-stimulated dopamine release showed it to be dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and was attenuated by 1 mM Co2+ or 1 mM Ni2+. However, release was unaffected by either the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel antagonist, verapamil, or the dihydropyridine (DHP) Ca2+ channel agonist, BAY K 8644. In contrast, 1 mM Co2+ completely blocked, verapamil inhibited and BAY K 8644 augmented K+-stimulated [3H]dopamine release. PC12 cells acutely exposed to ethanol (100 and 200 mM) showed diminished K+-stimulated [3H]dopamine release but an unaltered bradykinin-stimulated response. Cells exposed to 200 mM ethanol for 6 days showed significantly enhanced [3H]dopamine release in response to high concentrations of K+ but no changes were observed in their response to bradykinin. These data provide evidence that ethanol, within the same cell, can differentially affect neurotransmitter release, dependent upon the secretagogue used.\r"

Although most airlines claim no ill effects from the stresses of air travel, airlines that fly longer routes tend to report a higher incidence of in-flight emergencies and sudden deaths than those that fly shorter routes. Reasons for these differences are discussed. The Federal Aviation Administration has recently upgraded the first aid kits carried by the airlines. Airlines must now report all untoward medical incidents to the government; this policy will permit the collection of better data concerning the true incidence of in-flight emergencies. Future studies should be oriented toward an analysis of the first aid kit's effectiveness and deficiencies. Emergency physicians are often required to make recommendations concerning the advisability of travel for patients who become ill away from home. Better criteria exist for making well-informed decisions for patients with obstructive pulmonary disease than for patients with other chronic diseases. A series of studies has suggested that physicians should recommend supplemental oxygen for normocapnic jet passengers who have a resting preflight Pao2 (at sea level) less than 67 mmHg. If available, preflight altitude stress testing should be performed on hypercapnic obstructive airways patients who request permission to fly. Poorly supported recommendations have been promulgated by several major professional organizations concerning flight advisability in a wide variety of other diseases. If these recommendations are followed strictly, people who become ill away from home can expect significant difficulty in returning home shortly after hospital discharge.\r"

Traumatic testicular torsion must also be diagnosed early to preclude testicular loss. Testicular scan, when rapidly available, is indicated in any case of suspected traumatic torsion. If testicular scanning is unavailable or equivocal, surgical exploration is indicated. Once torsion is ruled out, ultrasound is a useful diagnostic technique in acute scrotal trauma to differentiate those scrotal and testicular injuries requiring surgical intervention.\r"

Some alterations in the pattern of PG are more likely to be secondary to hypertension, whereas others may reflect a defective adaptation to the hypertensive state thus contributing to the rise in blood pressure. A major role for vasodilatory arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites is to modulate the effects of vasoconstrictor stimuli on renal vasculature and sodium excretion; thus, an alteration of this interplay may be responsible for some forms of experimental and human hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The manifestations of cardiac involvement in hypertension include: (1) the development of hypertensive heart disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and (2) the consequences of coronary atherosclerosis, as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. Whereas the former is directly related to increased blood pressure, the latter are sequelae of atherosclerosis per se, and hypertension acts only as a risk factor in this regard. This can partially explain why antihypertensive treatment is effective in diminishing the incidence of congestive heart failure, which is the final consequence of LVH, but is not very effective in preventing coronary complications. It is generally accepted about LVH that increased arterial pressure is the major stimulus to cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension; however, there are a lot of both quantitative and qualitative events suggesting that other factors beside blood pressure levels can modulate the development of LVH, in particular neurohumoral influences. From a morphological point of view, hypertrophy of the cardiac muscle is defined as an increase in the size of existing myocardial fibers. In most experimental models, myocardial hypertrophy is associated with myosin isoenzymatic changes, consisting in a shift from the faster migrating isoenzyme V1 to V3, a form that migrates more slowly. However these changes do not occur in all animal species and particularly in humans. In the hypertrophied human ventricle, a decreased ATPase activity of myofibrils was observed, probably related to changes in myosin light chains. Presently the changes in ATPase activity and in ventricular contractility do not still have a clear molecular basis in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In both species, abnormalities of renal function have been demonstrated before the development of hypertension. Moreover hypertension could be \"transplanted\" with the kidney when kidney cross-transplantation was carried out between MHS and the Milan normotensive strain (MNS). Also in humans, the familiality for hypertension of the donor affected the requirement of antihypertensive therapy of the recipient. Further studies furnished results that were consistent with the hypothesis that a primary increase in Na transport across the tubular cell could be responsible for the pressor effect of the kidney in MHS or in humans. Because many similarities were found between the function of the tubular cell and the red blood cell in MHS, red blood cells were used to gain information about the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying these cellular changes. The results so far obtained showed that red blood cell abnormalities in MHS were genetically determined within the stem cells and genetically associated with the development of hypertension in F2 hybrids obtained by crossing the F1 (MHS X MNS). Moreover, the abnormal Na transport across the cell membrane may be due to an abnormal function of the membrane skeleton proteins. Studies are in progress to evaluate a possible cause-effect relationship between: membrane skeleton protein-ion transport across the cell membrane and the development of hypertension.\r"

Both acute and chronic hypercalcemia increase blood pressure primarily via direct effects on vascular smooth muscle contractility. The evidence for indirect effects through activation of hormonal pressor systems is inconclusive. In apparent contrast with the notion that hypercalcemia can cause hypertension, more recently it has been proposed that calcium deficiency may be important in the genesis of hypertension both in humans and in spontaneously hypertensive animals. However, the evidence supporting this notion is still conflicting. Parathyroid hormone exerts complex actions on the cardiovascular system. On one hand, if injected in pharmacological doses, it is a vasodilator and antagonizes the pressor action of norepinephrine and angiotensin II; on the other hand, parathyroid hormone can potentiate the pressor effect of hypercalcemia.\r"

In Group 1 there was no significant correlation among systolic blood pressure (SBP) and anthropometric data at rest, but it was significantly correlated during HG with W, H, BI, and AC. In Group 2, SBP was significantly correlated only with W and BI at rest, with W, H, BI, and AC during HG. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was well correlated, both at rest and during HG, with anthropometric data in both groups studied. No correlation was found between BP and urinary excretion of electrolytes.

Activation of the renal nerves also exerts an important permissive role in order to amplify and possibly accelerate responses to stimuli affecting the vascular and macula densa mechanisms. Reduction of renal perfusion pressure, intravenous infusion of furosemide, and captopril administration cause a greater increase in renin release from innervated kidneys than from denervated kidneys. A complex interaction between neural and non-neural mechanisms in the control of renin secretion is suggested. Efferent renal nerve activity controlling the renin secretion rate is mainly under the inhibitory influence of vagal afferent fibers originating from the cardiopulmonary region. Recent experiments have demonstrated that a similar reflex tonic inhibition of renin secretion is also exerted by renal afferent fibers.\r"

Several prospective epidemiological and clinical studies have indicated that regression of cardiovascular alterations, preferably when still at an initial stage, is a desirable goal in the treatment of hypertension. Clinical assessment of cardiac hypertrophy may be precisely obtained with echocardiography. Structural vascular changes may be evaluated indirectly in man by measuring minimal vascular resistance from maximal blood flow and arterial pressure. The results of a large number of studies have indicated that in hypertensive patients a significant regression of cardiovascular structural changes may be obtained with several antihypertensive drugs, but they have not yet established whether a complete \"normalization\" may be really obtained. Further studies are needed to identify factors that modulate regression of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy. Most important, it still remains to be clarified whether regression of cardiovascular structural changes in hypertensives significantly improves prognosis per se independently from blood pressure reduction.\r"

Loop diuretics, cardioselective and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) beta-blockers, calcium entry-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors either do not significantly reduce or even increase renal perfusion. This is one more reason for considering these agents as first choice drugs for the treatment of hypertension.\r"

The reduction in plasma potassium and the changes in lipoproteins should represent the mechanisms of the negative interference of diuretics at cardiac levels. In spite of this common opinion, there is no clinically consistent evidence that the lowering of serum potassium and the changes in lipoproteins are responsible for the lack of cardioprotection during antihypertensive therapy. It is possible that other causes, for instance the reflex activation of sympathetic nervous system and/or renin secretion, may play an important role in determining the cardiac effects of antihypertensive therapy. However, it is also true that diuretics have been used in the past at doses that were too high, and the changes in serum potassium and lipoproteins can be minimized by administering lower doses of diuretics without decreasing their antihypertensive efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "While there is general agreement on the natural history, pathology, and pathophysiology of hypertension, there continues to be controversy over the selection of specific antihypertensive agents. All antihypertensive agents will, by definition, lower blood pressure, and factors beyond side effects and other difficulties associated with therapy form the basis of selecting specific agents. One of these factors is the effect of a given drug on core organ function. Propranolol was the first beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent introduced for the treatment of hypertension. Initiation of therapy with propranolol may result in a decline in blood pressure more at the expense of cardiac function due to a concomitant rise in total peripheral resistance. Furthermore, propranolol may result in a decline in both glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF). In contrast, cardioselective beta-blockers or those with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may not adversely affect renal function. It had been predicted that nadolol, a noncardioselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, should result in decreased renal function. In contrast, observations demonstrated a preservation or improvement in both RBF and GFR, suggesting the presence of an alternative effective mechanism. Recent additions to the beta-adrenolytic group of antihypertensive agents include drugs with concurrent beta-blockade and vasodilation. This vasodilatation may be achieved through agonist properties resulting in lesser increases in vasomotor tone and smaller, if any, decreases in cardiac output. Alternatively, vasodilation may be achieved by concomitant alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, such as with labetalol. This agent preserves GFR and RBF during therapy of hypertension, in patients with normal as well as diminished renal function and hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The calcium entry-blockers appear to be the most useful agents for the treatment of hypertension in the elderly and for the treatment of hypertension associated with ischemic heart disease, pulmonary obstructive disease, peripheral vascular disease, and supraventricular arrhythmias. They are effective in reducing blood pressure in pregnancy-associated hypertension and must be considered as first-line therapy for the treatment of hypertensive crisis.\r"

Available data indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are as effective in reducing blood pressure as thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, and that they maintain their effect without the development of tolerance. Therefore they may be expected to achieve at least the same prevention of target organ damage (heart failure, cerebral strokes, and arterial nephrosclerosis) as achieved by previous drugs and also to be effective when target organs have already been damaged. Moreover ACEIs seem to offer two possible advantages: cardioprotection and a favorable influence on the quality of life. Many experimental but indeed few clinical data suggest that these drugs can exert primary cardioprotection and that they might exert a beneficial therapeutic effect in hypertensives with coronary heart disease. Owing to the quality of their hypotensive effect, to the lack of detrimental effects on physical, psychical, and sexual activity, and to the positive influence on the sense of well-being, ACEIs seem to be better tolerated than previous drugs. However, although available data suggest that ACEIs can be considered a further advance in the treatment of hypertension, more extensive information is needed to confirm these promising results.\r"

Both nicardipine and propranolol as monotherapies and in combination achieved statistically significant, (P less than .01), supine diastolic blood pressure reduction relative to baseline. The combination of nicardipine and propranolol showed a greater reduction in supine diastolic and systolic measurements than either of the monotherapies. Nicardipine produced greater blood pressure reductions one hour after dosing, whereas the propranolol treatment tended to produce slightly greater blood pressure decreases eight hours after dose. The combination always resulted in the greatest blood pressure reduction, independent of time after dose. Adverse experiences were reported by 26% of patients in the nicardipine-treated group, most often transient vasodilatory effects, by 17% of the propranolol-treated patients, and by 18% of the combination-treated group. This study demonstrated at the doses studied that nicardipine alone produced equivalent blood pressure reductions to those obtained by propranolol alone, but that the combination of these two drugs produced greater reductions in blood pressures than either of the monotherapies.\r"

Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased after glucose ingestion (P less than .01), but changes in PRA did not correlate with changes in sodium excretion. We conclude that the antinatriuresis following glucose ingestion does not result from alterations in noradrenergic-dopaminergic activity or changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Insulin may modulate renal sodium metabolism directly, or through a yet unknown mechanism.\r"

Of twenty-five subjects with high renin essential hypertension (ten females, 15 males, mean age 30 years), 14 were noted to have a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) when sodium intake was increased from 10 to 100 mmol/d. The percentage response of plasma renin activity was greater in these patients than in those with an increase in MAP (-55.4 +/- 5.4 v -33.6 +/- 6.9, P = .018). Overall, the response of MAP was directly correlated to the percentage response of plasma renin activity (r = .549, P = .005), and inversely related to the change in serum calcium concentration (corrected for changes in serum albumin) (r = -.547, P = .005). No intercorrelation between the changes in plasma renin activity and serum calcium concentration was detected. The blood pressure response to increased sodium intake in high renin hypertension would appear to be divergent and related not only to the suppression of plasma renin activity, but also to changes in circulating calcium.\r"

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were increased following short-term therapy (four weeks); however, there was no net change in GFR or ERPF (compared to placebo) following long-term therapy (12 weeks).

They had taken no diuretics and no converting-enzyme inhibitors for more than four days. The interpretation of the results of the test was done according to the criteria defined by Muller et al. All patients underwent a digital venous angiography and when positive or doubtful, a conventional angiography. Eleven patients (10%) had unilateral or bilateral artery stenosis greater than 70%. The sensitivity of the test was 73% with a specificity of 84% and a positive predictive value of 35%. The three patients with a false negative test underwent a surgical treatment or a transluminal angioplasty of the stenosis but remained hypertensive. Thus, the captopril test is a useful screening test for identifying patients with renovascular disease, even in a population with a low prevalence of the disease.\r"

Changes in endothelial permeability, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and accumulation of connective tissue matrix are major common mechanisms. Chronic hyperlipidemia is a major determinant of the proliferative arterial lesions in atherogenic models. Calcium antagonists of very diverse structure and function have been shown to have antiatherogenic potential in several animal model systems of arterial injury. Calcium channel-blockers of several chemical classes have been demonstrated to alter endothelial function, intimal smooth muscle proliferation, and lipid accumulation in the arterial wall. Cell culture model systems have elucidated several potential mechanisms that may contribute to the antiatherogenic potential of the calcium channel-blockers. These activities may in part involve protection of arterial cells from calcium overload via inhibition of calcium flux across voltage-regulated ion channels. However, other activities of these drugs, such as inhibition of cholesterol esterification and matrix protein formation, appear to function independently of calcium flux. A hypothesis is presented that lipophilic calcium channel-blockers are accumulated in cell membranes and perturb metabolic function as a result of altering local membrane structure.\r"

Small cell carcinoma lines (SCCL) have properties of amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) cells and express high levels of the enzyme, L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase. We looked for possible expression of GM-CSF receptors on nonhematopoietic cells and found specific high-affinity binding of human GM-CSF to SCCL and to the SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney cell line, COS. The small cell carcinoma lines responded to GM-CSF with enhanced proliferation, and both small cells and COS cells were found to express authentic 84,000 dalton GM-CSF receptor protein. These findings indicate that nonhematopoietic cells can bind and respond to GM-CSF, suggesting additional biological activities as well as the possibility of tumor responses when GM-CSF is used therapeutically in humans. Since preliminary clinical trials using CSFs as adjunctive treatment in patients with solid tumors are underway, it will be important to consider the possible responsiveness of nonhematopoietic tumor cells to CSFs.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive concentrations of hydrogen peroxide inhibit the neutrophil myeloperoxidase system, presumably by inactivating the hypochlorous acid produced by this system. Ammonium ion generated by neutrophils and other cells can react with hypochlorous acid to produce monochloramine, an oxidant with good microbicidal activity, but relative resistance to inactivation by other compounds. In an assay based on the oxidation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid, hydrogen peroxide reacted more readily with sodium hypochlorite (used as a source of hypochlorous acid) than with monochloramine. Also, in this assay Candida albicans yeast inactivated the oxidant activity of hypochlorous acid more completely than they did that of monochloramine. The killing of Candida by sodium hypochlorite, as determined in a standard colony count microbicidal assay, was inhibited by equimolar and greater concentrations of hydrogen peroxide; killing of this organism by monochloramine was not affected by a tenfold excess concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In microbicidal assays using 4 mU of myeloperoxidase and optimal or excessive concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or glucose and glucose oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide, the excessive concentrations inhibited killing of Candida, but not Staphylococcus aureus. The inhibition of Candida killing could be reversed by addition of ammonium ion to convert hypochlorous acid to monochloramine. These results indicate that for certain organisms such as C albicans, conversion of hypochlorous acid to monochloramine by reactions with ammonium ion may extend the range of hydrogen peroxide concentrations under which killing by the myeloperoxidase system can occur by protecting the necessary microbicidal oxidants from inactivation by excess hydrogen peroxide.\r"

  ".U": "89150440\r", 
  ".W": "Plasma cell myeloma is a more complex neoplasm than suggested by the relative uniformity of its dominant plasma cells, which represent the terminal stage of normal B-cell differentiation. Phenotypic, molecular, and cellular genetic data favor the presence of a myeloma stem cell early in hematopoietic development so that, as in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a far distance exists between the primordial malignant cell that was the target of malignant transformation and the dominant clinical phenotype. Traces of pre-B, myeloid, and T cells are coexpressed with the mature B-cell phenotype, an occurrence unknown in normal B-cell differentiation. Analogous to CML, disease progression is marked by disease dedifferentiation, occasionally with cessation of myeloma protein production and development instead of extramedullary lymphomalike features with high LDH or myelodysplasia/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) syndromes. The prognostic importance of serum LDH levels even in newly diagnosed myeloma suggests the early presence of tumor cells with \"LDH phenotype,\" which, as a result of drug resistance and proliferative advantage, expand preferentially during disease progression. Further characterization of these cells may provide important clues about the ontogeny of multiple myeloma. Myeloma cells express many receptors for different biological signals that might be exploitable for therapy with immunotoxins or radioisotopes. Plasma cells and their precursors also produce a variety of cytokines, some of which have putatively autostimulatory functions (eg, IL-1, IL-5, IL-6) and/or are related to disease manifestations (eg, IL-1 and TNF-beta as OAF). The wealth of cellular expression by plasma cells provides clues for understanding the mechanisms of gene activation and the nature of abnormal growth and differentiation. The accuracy of prognostically relevant staging systems has been refined with the use of new quantitative parameters that reflect tumor mass (ie, serum B2M levels) and biology. Further studies of cellular and molecular biology (ie, CAL-LA, H-ras) may reveal those tumor cell features that define clinical entities, response to therapy, and long-term prognosis. The lack of a major advance in prognosis despite the use of more drugs and more intensive regimens justifies the continued use of standard melphalan-prednisone for patients with a highly favorable prognosis, for the very aged, and for those with a short life expectancy due to other major medical problems. However, a radical departure from standard practice is required to improve the prognosis for younger patients with poor risk features.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This analysis revealed that whereas NHL with a putative derivation from recirculating mature T and B lymphocytes almost invariably express high levels of LHR, those akin to sessile mature or immature lymphocytes tend to express lower levels of LHR. Furthermore, in a survey among diffuse large-cell lymphomas of the B-lineage, the tumors of 11 of 13 patients with stage III/IV disease expressed moderate to high levels of LHR, whereas only two of 17 patients with stage I/II disease had tumors that did so.

A total of 29 samples examined were at chronic phase and 22 were at blast crisis (eight lymphoid, eight myeloid, and six undifferentiated). No mutations were identified in N-ras or H-ras. Two patients in myeloid blast crisis had K-ras mutations, one patient at codon 12, the other at codon 13.

  ".W": "The value of a postremission treatment in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), with alternating combinations of non-cross-resistant drugs, has been prospectively assessed. Of 515 evaluable patients, 347 (67.4%) entered into complete remission (CR), following induction treatment with daunorubicin (DNR), vincristine (VCR), and cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). After one consolidation course, 248 patients were randomized for six courses of intensive maintenance: either repeated treatment with DNR-VCR-ara-C, or alternating treatment where amsacrine (AMSA) was combined with high dose ara-C on cycle 1,3, and 5 and with 5-azacytidine on cycle 2, 4, and 6. Ninety-nine patients were not randomized: 57 were introduced in a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) program, and 42 went off study, mainly for treatment toxicity or refusal. The main prognostic factors for achievement of CR were performance status, cytogenetics, and age, and for the disease-free survival (DFS): age and number of courses to CR. The rate of second remission was fairly high (64%) for patients relapsing off therapy. The DFS appeared identical (median, 53 weeks), in the two randomized arms, the alternating treatment not showing superiority to the repeated one, in spite of an increased toxicity. The median overall survival for patients achieving a CR was 90 weeks. The reason for the failure of alternating maintenance treatment to improve the DFS is probably related to an insufficient dose intensity: five patients who relapsed during maintenance arm B achieved a second CR with a more intensive combination of high-dose ara-C and AMSA. In addition, 60 patients underwent a BMT (43 allogeneic and 17 autologous). The DFS of patients treated with allogeneic BMT tended to be superior to the one obtained with the chemotherapy program. However the overall survival, as well as the event-free survival, seemed equivalent, including patients who relapsed before the planned BMT. Comparisons between allogeneic BMT, autologous BMT, and intensive consolidation during first CR deserve further prospective studies in AML.\r"

  ".W": "A synergistic factor that is produced by the human bladder carcinoma cell line 5637 (SF-1) stimulates primitive bone marrow progenitor cells, termed high proliferative-potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC), in the presence of an optimal dose of macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1). Recent reports have demonstrated that interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1) is identical to hemopoietin 1 and have suggested that IL-1 is the synergistic factor present in 5637 conditioned medium (cm). We have compared the ability of recombinant human IL-1 alpha and partially purified preparations of SF-1 to synergize with optimal doses of CSF-1 to stimulate HPP-CFC. In all experiments performed the numbers of HPP-CFC colonies formed with IL-1 were significantly less than with SF-1. Replating experiments demonstrated that SF-1 plus CSF-1 generated HPP-CFC (responsive to IL-3 plus CSF-1); however, IL-1 plus CSF-1 resulted in no generation of HPP-CFC. Multiple factor combinations of IL-1 and SF-1 with G-CSF, GM-CSF, and CSF-1 also resulted in less HPP-CFC colony formation in cultures containing IL-1 compared with SF-1. Incubation of SF-1 with an antibody to IL-6 had no effect on HPP-CFC colony formation and IL-6 did not synergize with IL-1 plus CSF-1 or SF-1 plus CSF-1. These data suggest the presence of a factor in 5637 cm, which is distinct from G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-6, which synergizes with IL-1 to produce the SF-1 effect.\r"

To determine which blood cells were responsible for this expression, we fractionated PHA/PMA-stimulated mononuclear cells and identified T lymphocytes as the source of IL-3 mRNA. Low-level IL-3 expression was detected as well in several stimulated human T-cell lines. Hematopoietic stromal cells such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells could not be induced to express IL-3 mRNA. The kinetics of IL-3 mRNA induction in mononuclear cells and lymphocytes stimulated with PHA/PMA or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) were similar to those observed for GM-CSF expression.\r"

In addition to free and protease inhibitor-bound tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), dextran sulfate precipitates of euglobulins contained the complex formed between plasma kallikrein and C1-inhibitor, an indicator of prekallikrein activation. These precipitates also contained substantial fibrinolytic activity related to urinary-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). Autoradiographic analysis was then used to evaluate the cleavage of 125I-single-chain u-PA (prourokinase) in dextran sulfate euglobulins as well as after exposure to kallikrein or beta-factor XIIa. This analysis supported the conclusion that plasma kallikrein-mediated cleavage and activation of single-chain u-PA is the mechanism operative for the development of lytic activity in euglobulin precipitates following activation of the contact system.\r"

These consisted of measurements of the electrosensitivity of the dorsal nerve of the penis/clitoris and of the urethra, measurement of the sacral reflex latencies (SRL) from dorsal nerve to urethra and to anus and between urethra and anus and EMG studies of the urethral and anal sphincters. The results suggest that female patients in particular have significant neurogenic defects in the voiding reflex arcs which find their clinical expression in detrusor underactivity with urinary retention. Plain X-rays of the renal tracts (KUB films) were also studied for the presence of spina bifida occulta. The prevalence of this defect was significantly higher than in normal controls, suggesting that in some of these patients the nerve defect might be related to a tethered cord in association with spina bifida occulta.\r"

In 4 patients (mean age 55.5 years), Escherichia coli was cultured from both mid-stream urine and epididymal aspirate. Transrectal ultrasound revealed abnormal prostatic scans in 19 patients (79%).

Despite many theories no definitive cause of PMS has been established, and controlled studies of various treatments have failed to find a universally effective approach. Conservative measures involving support, diet and exercise seem to help in most cases. The use of alprazolam and mefenamic acid may help some women.

In a randomized double-blind crossover trial we compared MSC given every 12 hours with a morphine sulfate solution (MSS) given every 4 hours to 17 patients suffering from chronic severe pain. After titration of the morphine dosage to optimize the analgesic effect, each patient received 10 days of therapy with either MSC or MSS, then 10 days of therapy with an equal daily dose of the other formulation. Both preparations provided effective pain control, with minimal side effects. There was no significant difference between MSC and MSS in pain scores on a visual analogue scale (VAS), severity scores for tiredness and nausea, amount of supplemental morphine needed for break-through pain or patient preference. The plasma morphine concentrations tended to be greater during treatment with MSC. The study had an 89% probability of detecting a clinically significant difference in VAS pain scores. We conclude that an individualized, twice-daily regimen of MSC is as effective as MSS given every 4 hours for control of severe pain. The twice-daily regimen has several advantages: it provides for an uninterrupted night's sleep, it is substantially more convenient than the six doses per day required with MSS, and it should help reduce both medication errors and noncompliance.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized clinical trial was performed to determine if the addition of hormonal therapy with tamoxifen to a combination chemotherapy regimen was superior to the chemotherapy alone for adjuvant treatment of premenopausal women after mastectomy for node-positive breast cancer. The chemotherapy regimen utilized consisted of cyclophosphamide (C), 5-fluorouracil (F), and prednisone (P), and the doses employed were: C, 150 mg/m2 IV days 1 to 5; F, 300 mg/m2 IV days 1 to 5; and P, 10 mg orally three times daily on days 1 to 7. A total of ten courses of therapy, given every 6 weeks, was planned. Tamoxifen (T) was given at a dose of 10 mg twice daily and was stopped 6 weeks after the last course of CFP. Four hundred patients are fully eligible and evaluable. With a median observation time of 5.3 years, the proportion of recurrences on each arm were: CFP, 95 of 202 (47%); CFPT, 77 of 198 (39%). The relapse-free survival distribution for CFPT was superior to that for CFP, at a borderline level of significance (two-sided P = 0.06). When significant prognostic factors were considered in covariate analysis, CFPT was not significantly better than CFP (P = 0.43). This marked change in level was due to imbalance in several factors not considered in stratification. Currently, 31% of CFP and 25% of CFPT patients have died, and although there is a slight separation of the survival curves in favor of CFPT, the difference is not significant (P = 0.21). Analysis within receptor subsets also showed no significant advantage for the addition of tamoxifen. This study does not establish a significant advantage for the concurrent administration of tamoxifen with the CFP regimen. It does, however, clearly demonstrate the importance of examination of clinically important prognostic factors, even those not utilized in stratification, and consideration of these factors in covariate analysis if imbalances are present.\r"

This report reviews the results of a randomized trial in patients with advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer which compared treatment with supportive care (treatment with palliative radiation, psychosocial support, analgesics, nutritional support) to supportive care plus combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinblastine. Although the patients receiving combination chemotherapy had a slightly longer median survival (20.43 weeks versus 13.57 weeks), it was not statistically significant (P = 0.09). In addition, the patients receiving chemotherapy experienced serious toxicity, and showed no significant benefit in terms of quality of life as measured by Karnofsky performance status score. The authors conclude that contemporary combination chemotherapy provides only modest survival benefit to patients with advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and should not be considered standard therapy. Future investigations of chemotherapy in patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer should continue to utilize control arms which provide high-quality supportive care.\r"

The chemotherapy was followed by autologous bone marrow rescue which was harvested under local anesthesia in 25 of the patients. The three regimens comprised a 24-hour infusion of DTIC (Regimen A for patients less than 45 years of age, 4.3 to 10.5 g/m2; B, if greater than 45 years of age 2.7 to 4.0 g/m2; and later C, if greater than 45 years of age 7.0 to 8.0 g/m2). The second alkylating agent was given at +8 and +16 hours from the start of DTIC. The total doses of the melphalan ranged from 60 to 130 mg/m2 for Regimen A and 30 to 40 mg/m2 for Regimen B. Ifosfamide 5.0 to 8.0 g/m2 was given instead of melphalan in Regimen C. The response rates for the regimens were 81% (25% CR) for A, 27% (11% CR) for B, and 20% (with no complete responders) for Regimen C. There was no statistically significant difference between the three regimens for survival with a median value of 6 months. One of the 16 patients treated with the very high dose Regimen A died of septicemia and three of ten patients in Regimen C died within the first 2 weeks of treatment. There was statistically significant greater myelosuppression, stomatitis, and diarrhea in the very high dosage DTIC and melphalan (Regimen A) compared with the other two regimens. No significant difference in response rate or toxicity was observed for the different dosages escalated within each of the three regimens. Although hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity were very severe, no unusual side effects were noted except for one episode of severe acute renal failure in the high-dose DTIC and melphalan, Regimen A. Responses occurred mainly in nonvisceral, nodal, and cutaneous sites and occasionally in pulmonary metastases. The Karnofsky performance improved 4 to 6 months after treatment notably with the high-dose DTIC and melphalan therapy. No survival benefit for the combination chemotherapy despite the high dosages was detected and such an approach currently cannot be recommended.\r"

The positive rate was 64% in adenocarcinoma, 7.7% in nonadenocarcinoma, and 0% in benign pulmonary disease, respectively, when a cutoff level was defined as the mean + 3 SD value (300 unit/ml) based on pleural fluid sialyl SSEA-1 levels in benign pulmonary disease. There was a significant positive correlation between pleural fluid levels of sialyl SSEA-1 and those of carcinoembryonic antigen in adenocarcinoma patients (r = 0.8246, P less than 0.01). Pleural fluid sialyl SSEA-1 levels correlated with cytologic findings in adenocarcinoma patients. These observations suggest that sialyl SSEA-1 in pleural effusion is a useful marker to discriminate malignant from nonmalignant and adenocarcinoma from nonadenocarcinoma of the lung.\r"
