  ".W": "Gonadal involvement in fetal FSH regulation was examined by studying FSH levels in 13 female (7 castrate and 6 sham control) and 13 male (8 castrate and 5 sham control) chronically catheterized ovine fetuses operated upon in utero at 106-115 days gestation (term = 147 days). These fetuses had been studied previously for pulsatile LH secretion every 2-7 days over a 2- to 38-day period until fetal delivery or death. From each study day, 3 1-h spaced blood samples (1.5-2.0 ml) were taken for FSH determination by RIA (NIH FSH-S8 standard), and the results were averaged. The overall mean was then calculated for each fetus. In female fetuses, there was no significant difference in mean serum FSH levels between castrates [53.4 +/- 5.0 ng/ml (+/- SEM)] and controls (52.5 +/- 14.4 ng/ml). In contrast, serum FSH levels in the eugonadal males were significantly (P less than 0.001) lower (23.4 +/- 8.0 ng/ml) than those in castrate males (56.9 +/- 7.1 ng/ml, a value comparable to those observed in both female groups). Mean serum FSH levels declined significantly (P less than 0.001) in castrate fetuses of both sexes after 125 days (61.5 +/- 5.6 vs. 42.4 +/- 7.7 ng/ml in females; 64.1 +/- 6.1 vs. 51.5 +/- 8.6 ng/ml in males). In the males, the FSH decline did not reach sham control levels, which remained unchanged with advancing gestation. Moreover, mean serum FSH levels were significantly higher in a group of 4 male fetuses (62.2 +/- 13.7 ng/ml) castrated at 121-130 days gestation compared to values in 3 age-matched sham castrate controls (22.1 +/- 2.6 ng/ml; P less than 0.001). The increment in serum FSH levels in castrate compared to sham castrate male fetuses demonstrates an important role for the fetal testis in FSH regulation from 106 days gestation until term. The lack of a detectable castration effect on the relatively high serum FSH levels in eugonadal females indicates that the fetal ovary does not play a similar role and suggests that in females, FSH is secreted in a functionally castrate mode. The decline in FSH levels after 125 days in castrate fetuses of both sexes may result at least in part from the previously reported coincident rise in circulating levels of feto-placental sex steroids and/or PRL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Estradiol (E) biosynthesis by the cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom) enzyme system increases as preovulatory follicles develop and is subsequently reduced by the ovulatory LH surge. To determine the specific effects of gonadotropins and steroids on expression of P450arom in rat granulosa cells, steady state levels of messenger (m) RNA were examined in vivo and in vitro, with the latter also being related to aromatase enzyme activity and cAMP production. P450arom mRNA and activity were induced in granulosa cells by FSH alone in a dose-, time-, and stage-dependent manner. E enhanced the effects of FSH in vivo and in vitro. The synergistic effect of E with FSH (50 ng/ml) was observed in the absence/presence of serum and was mimicked by a similar concentration (20 nM) of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, or dexamethasone. In contrast, ovulatory doses of LH (500 ng/ml) or forskolin (10 microM) but not concentrations of progesterone reached in preovulatory follicles (100-1000 nM) acted on differentiated (FSH + E) granulosa cells to cause a rapid loss of P450arom mRNA. Whereas cycloheximide prevented the LH/cAMP-mediated decrease in P450arom mRNA in the differentiated cells, enzyme activity remained unaltered during the same 6-h period. Thus, expression of aromatase mRNA in rat granulosa cells is induced primarily by low FSH/cAMP, enhanced by physiological doses of several steroids (except progesterone), and, once induced, can be rapidly inhibited by elevated gonadotropin/cAMP via a pathway requiring protein synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of FSH, testosterone (T), and incubation temperature on the development of inter-Sertoli cell (Sc) tight junctions were investigated in vitro by using repetitive measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Control cultures developed stable TER of 100-145 omega cm2 during the initial 3-4 days of incubation at either 33 or 36.5 C, suggesting the formation of simple but continuous tight junctions. The presence of FSH (200 ng/ml) at 33 C delayed the onset of TER development by 3-5 days. The addition of FSH at the time of stable TER (day 5) resulted in a rapid (24 h) decrease of TER to 35-40 omega cm2, which returned to the control level during the subsequent 5-7 days. T alone (0.001-10 microM) caused an early and dose-dependent increase in TER to 165-240 omega cm2. In mono-layers incubated at 36.5 C, the continuous presence of FSH resulted in a dose-dependent increase in TER, which stabilized at 260-380 omega cm2 after 4-6 days. At this temperature, the addition of FSH on day 5 caused a rapid drop of TER similar to that observed at 33 C. This drop could not be prevented by antiproteases (aprotinin, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, or 10% fetal bovine serum) and was followed by an increase in TER up to 260-300-omega cm2. The Sc monolayers developed FSH-induced TER of 230-280 omega cm2 at 33 C, but only after several days of culture at 36.5 C. The effects of T at 36.5 and 33 C were similar, but the maximal TER values were significantly higher (290-380 omega cm2) at 36.5 C. The concomitant presence of T and FSH at 36.5 C resulted in the highest TER levels (580-1200 omega cm2) within 4-6 days, suggesting the synergistic effect of the two hormones on TER development. Dihydrotestosterone was more effective than T when used together with FSH, whereas estradiol had no effect. The different patterns of TER did not result from differences in Sc number or metabolic activity and probably reflected developmental and/or maturational changes in the inter-Sc tight junctions. It is concluded that FSH, T, and temperature play a role in the development of high TER by Sc monolayers (formation of tight junctions) in vitro. FSH and T appear to regulate TER via separate pathways and to cooperate by a yet unknown synergistic mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the present work we evaluated the interactions of adrenergic receptors with phospholipase-C (PLC) and protein kinase-C (PKC), using an in vitro system of hypothalamic neurons and astroglial cells in primary cultures. The study was performed on immature neurons after 7 days in vitro (7 Div), that is before synaptogenesis, as well as on mature cells (14 Div). Comparisons were made between neurons and glial cells at the corresponding developmental stages. Norepinephrine (NE) increased inositol phosphates (IPs) formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The NE effect was mediated by alpha 1-receptor (alpha 1R) and was observed in young cells before synaptogenesis as well as in mature neuronal cultures; its amplitude was enhanced during the latter stage of the neuronal development. The coupling of alpha 1R with PLC was partially sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment and did not implicate the activation of calcium voltage-dependent channels. Activation of PKC by 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) inhibited in a time-dependent manner the NE-stimulated production of IPs in young and mature hypothalamic neurons; however, in PKC depleted cells NE-induced IPs formation remained unchanged. In hypothalamic astroglial cell cultures the adrenergic stimulus of IPs generation was also mediated by alpha 1R. The effect was observed at both developmental stages, with a greater response in 14 Div cultures, and was insensitive to pertussis toxin treatment. As in neurons, activation of PKC resulted in inhibition of NE-induced IPs formation. These data indicate that functional interrelation between alpha 1R, PLC, and PKC is already present in immature neurons and glial cells and progressively develops in culture.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the effect of LH on the regulation of the progesterone receptor (PR) in cultured porcine granulosa cells. In this study we used the RNase protection assay to evaluate the PR mRNA levels with a porcine cDNA clone isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. This clone was regarded as part of the porcine PR cDNA because of its 98.3% and 95.7% homology to the hormone-binding domain of human PR cDNA in amino acid and nucleotide sequences, respectively. Treatment with LH (500 ng/ml) increased porcine PR mRNA to a maximum level of 8.6 +/- 1.1-fold (mean +/- SE) after 3-h exposure. This induction was mimicked by (Bu)2cAMP as well as by FSH and hCG, and the increased PR caused by LH and (Bu)2cAMP occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Basal and LH-induced PR mRNA levels were not affected by progesterone (100 ng/ml), estrogen (100 ng/ml), and RU 486 (10 ng/ml) at 3 h. The mechanism of the increased PR mRNA levels was studied in the presence of actinomycin-D and cycloheximide. While inhibition of RNA synthesis with actinomycin-D blocked LH-induced PR mRNA expression, inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide increased basal and LH-induced PR mRNA levels. These results indicate that the expression of PR mRNA is positively regulated by LH, and this induction does not require ongoing protein synthesis. There may be a cycloheximide-sensitive mechanism that modulates PR mRNA stability. From our results we suspect that progesterone modulates ovarian function through LH-induced PR in granulosa cells.\r"

Intra-articular bleeding occurred more frequently in the joints of the lower extremities than in the joints of the upper extremities. During the second decade of life, hemarthroses occurred more often in the ankle than in the knee. A history of recurrent bleeding into the ankle joint, chronic synovitis, and overgrowth of the medial portion of the distal tibial epiphysis was associated with an early onset of arthropathy. In older patients, compression arthrodesis of the ankle joint was helpful in eliminating pain, recurrent bleeding, and equinus deformity.\r"

By using extracts of serial frozen sections with a combination of gel chromatography and chemical, radioimmunoassay, and morphometric analyses, we demonstrated that, in the bovine fetal physis, the content of large aggregating proteoglycans reaches a maximum in the extracellular matrix of the hypertrophic zone, in the region where calcification begins, at the time when calcification starts. Morphometric analyses revealed that, at this time, the volume of matrix is reduced to a minimum. There was no evidence that the remaining proteoglycans were reduced in size, nor was aggregation changed at the time when calcification was initiated. Thus, contrary to earlier reports, there is no indication that these molecules need to be degraded and removed for calcification to begin, although a progressive loss of proteoglycans clearly occurs as the volume of the matrix is reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the present investigation was to define the relationship between serum GH and estradiol levels during the follicular phase in women with normal ovulatory menstrual cycles compared with that in women undergoing superovulation with human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) alone or hMG plus GnRH agonists during treatment for infertility. Serum GH and estradiol levels were determined by immunoassay in eight women during the follicular phase of a spontaneous natural cycle (group I). Thirty women underwent ovulation induction with hMG alone (group II), and 30 women received GnRH agonists followed by hMG (group III). During the follicular phase estradiol levels increased gradually in group I and reached a peak estradiol level of 1.19 +/- 0.2 nmol/L (mean +/- SEM). As expected, estradiol levels rose faster and reached higher levels in groups II and III (5.44 +/- 0.62 and 8.73 +/- 0.91 nmol/L, respectively). Whereas serum GH levels increased minimally in group I, reaching a peak level of 2.54 +/- 1.15 nmol/L, serum GH concentrations increased markedly after day 8 in groups II and III, reaching peak levels of 8.70 +/- 1.58 and 7.54 +/- 1.12 nmol/L, respectively (P less than 0.01). Basal to peak GH levels were higher in groups II and III than in group I. In summary, there are modest increases in GH levels during the follicular phase of the normal menstrual cycle, but the levels are markedly increased during superovulation with hMG or hMG plus GnRH agonists, and parallel increases in estradiol levels.\r"

  ".W": "The recent availability of both cordocentesis, a low risk and effective technique for fetal blood sampling, and ultrasensitive/highly specific two-site immunofluorometric assays (IFMA) for pituitary and chorionic glycoprotein hormone (I-LH, I-FSH, and I-CG) measurement prompted us to study the maturation of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal function in 114 normal human fetuses (49 females and 65 males) from 17-40 weeks gestation. The subjects were selected from 216 consecutive cordocenteses carried out for rapid karyotyping and diagnosis of fetal infection or hematological disorders. In addition, FSH bioactivity (B-FSH) was measured by rat Sertoli cell aromatase induction assay, glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit (alpha-SU) by RIA, and circulating free testosterone (fT) by direct analog technique. No significant cross-reactions were recorded in the different measurement methods. In particular, alpha-SU did not interfere in any IFMA, and CG cross-reactivity in LH IFMA was 0.5%. Circulating I-LH, I-FSH, and B-FSH levels at 17-24 weeks gestation were significantly higher in female than in male fetuses (I-LH, 48 +/- 4 vs. 6.3 +/- 0.7 U/L; I-FSH, 35 +/- 2 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.1 U/L; B-FSH, 131 +/- 17 vs. 43.4 +/- 5.4 U/L). During the last weeks of gestation, a significant decrease in I-LH and I-FSH levels was seen in both female and male fetuses (I-LH, 0.24 +/- 0.05 and 1.0 +/- 0.3 U/L; I-FSH, 0.45 +/- 0.1 and 0.5 +/- 0.1 U/L), while serum B-FSH remained elevated, but the previously recorded difference between sexes disappeared (54.3 +/- 7.2 and 58.7 +/- 7.3 U/L). Circulating I-CG and alpha-SU levels at midgestation were elevated in both female and male fetuses (I-CG, 117 +/- 29 and 191 +/- 44 U/L; alpha-SU, 143 +/- 16 and 105 +/- 9 micrograms/L, respectively) and decreased thereafter (I-CG, 42 +/- 9 and 26 +/- 6 U/L; alpha-SU, 60 +/- 15 and 37 +/- 6 micrograms/L). Serum fT levels at midgestation were significantly lower in females than in males (4.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 10.0 +/- 0.8 pmol/L) and increased until term, when the difference between sexes disappeared (16.2 +/- 1.8 vs. 17.6 +/- 1.6 pmol/L).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The next day, animals (n = 4-6/group) received: 1) no ovulatory stimulus; 2) 1000 IU hCG, im; 3) one injection of 100 micrograms GnRH, sc (GnRH-1); 4) three injections of GnRH (GnRH-3) at 3-h intervals (0800, 1100, and 1400 h); or 5) two injections of 50 micrograms GnRH agonist (GnRHa), sc, 8 h apart (0800 and 1700 h) to induce ovulatory maturation. Follicles were aspirated 27 h after the hCG or initial GnRH/GnRHa injection or on days 8 and 10 in animals receiving no ovulatory stimulus. Nuclear maturity of oocytes was evaluated as a marker for reinitiation of meiosis. Estradiol and progesterone levels were determined in daily serum samples by RIA. Levels of LH(-like) bioactivity were measured at selected intervals after hCG injection and within 24 h of GnRH/GnRHa treatment. In all groups, estradiol continuously rose to similar peak levels on day 10. The hCG treatment markedly elevated circulating LH-like bioactivity for up to 3 days. In GnRH-1, bioactive LH increased to 433.1 +/- 170.2 ng/mL (mean +/- SEM; n = 3) within 1-2 h, but then decreased to baseline (4.9 +/- 1.5 ng/mL) within 6 h. GnRH-3 and GnRHa treatment extended the interval of elevated bioactive LH to 8 and 14 h, respectively. There was no difference in the peak levels of LH(-like) bioactivity reached after hCG, GnRH, or GnRHa injection. Functional luteal phases were absent in monkeys receiving no ovulatory stimulus, whereas hCG treatment increased progesterone levels to 101 +/- 9 nmol/L (n = 6) and elicited functional luteal phases of 11.8 +/- 0.4 days. In contrast, only one animal in the GnRH/GnRHa groups (i.e. one GnRH-3 monkey) displayed elevated progesterone levels in the luteal phase. Of the total cohort of oocytes aspirated from follicles, a greater (P less than 0.05) proportion were classified as being in metaphase I or II of meiosis after hCG treatment (86%) compared to no ovulatory stimulus (13%), GnRH-1 (0%), GnRH-3 (43%), and GnRHa (12%). Thus, GnRH elicits a transient LH surge that can be extended by GnRH-3 or GnRHa in stimulated cycles of monkeys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The events in granulosa cells that are initiated by the midcycle LH surge during luteinization of the primate follicle are poorly defined. This study was designed 1) to determine whether an ovulatory dose of hCG can induce progesterone receptors (PR) in macaque granulosa cells, and if so, 2) to begin titrating gonadotropin requirements for PR expression and progesterone production by luteinizing granulosa cells. Rhesus monkeys were treated with human FSH and LH for up to 9 days to stimulate the growth of multiple follicles. The next day, animals (n = 4-5/group) received: 1) no ovulatory stimulus; 2) 1000 IU hCG, im; 3) one injection of 100 micrograms GnRH, sc (GnRH-1); 4) three injections of GnRH (GnRH-3) at 3-h intervals (0800, 1100, and 1400 h); or 5) two injections of 50 micrograms GnRH agonist (GnRHa), sc, 8 h apart (0800 and 1700 h). Granulosa cells obtained by follicle aspiration 27 h after the hCG or initial GnRH/GnRHa injection or on days 8 or 10 from animals receiving no ovulatory stimulus were processed for indirect immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to human PR (JZB39). Specific staining for PR, determined by comparing cells incubated with PR antibody vs. a nonspecific antibody, was undetectable in granulosa cells from monkeys without an ovulatory stimulus. In contrast, the majority (64 +/- 5%) of cells from hCG-treated animals stained intensely for PR. In the GnRH/GnRHa groups, granulosa cells from only one animal (i.e. one GnRH-3 monkey) showed positive staining for PR. During 24-h culture in Ham's F-10 medium containing 10% monkey serum, basal progesterone production by cells from the hCG-treated group (2163 nmol/L.8 x 10(4) cells) was higher than that by cells from the no ovulatory stimulus/GnRH-1/GnRH-3/GnRHa groups (60, 111, 194, and 332 nmol/L, respectively). However, granulosa cells from the hCG-treated group were less responsive to hCG in vitro in terms of enhanced progesterone production (2 times control levels) than cells from the other four groups (up to 30 times control levels). This study provides direct evidence that an ovulatory dose of hCG induces PR expression in granulosa cells of luteinizing follicles during stimulated cycles in rhesus monkeys. However, repeated injections of GnRH/GnRHa that produced surge levels (greater than 100 ng/mL) of endogenous LH for up to 14 h failed to induce PR expression or progesterone production by granulosa cells. Thus, an extended LH surge more typical of that in the normal menstrual cycle (48-50 h) may be necessary for PR expression and luteinization of granulosa cells in primate follicles.\r"

Follow-up testicular biopsies performed 3 (n = 19) and 24 (n = 14) months after the treatment showed in all cases a Sertoli cell-only pattern. Hormonal evaluation was performed before as well as 3, 12, 24, and 36 months after radiation treatment. Endocrine parameters were followed for a median of 30 months (3-36 months). Baseline serum testosterone values decreased during the follow-up period from 13.3 +/- 6.0 to 10.8 +/- 6.4 nmol/L (mean +/- SD), although the decrease was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). Serum LH values increased during the first 3 months of follow-up from 10.4 +/- 5.4 to 15.6 +/- 7.3 IU/L (P less than 0.0001) and then remained unchanged. Significant decreases in GnRH- and hCG-stimulated testosterone levels also indicated an impairment of Leydig cell function. FSH levels increased (P less than 0.0001) during the first 3 months of follow-up from 21.8 +/- 11.1 to 33.2 +/- 13.2 IU/L. We conclude that localized irradiation of 20 Gray eradicated carcinoma in situ germ cells. Development of a second testicular cancer has until now been prevented. Leydig cell function was partially impaired by the radiation dose given.\r"

  ".W": "The precise sites of action of the negative feed-back effects of gonadal steroids in men remain unclear. To determine whether testosterone (T) administration can suppress gonadotropin secretion directly at the level of the pituitary, the pituitary responses to physiological doses of GnRH were assessed in six men with complete GnRH deficiency, whose pituitary-gonadal function had been normalized with long term pulsatile GnRH delivery, before and during a 4-day continuous T infusion (15 mg/day). Their responses were compared with the effects of identical T infusions on spontaneous gonadotropin secretion and the response to a 100-micrograms GnRH bolus in six normal men. Both groups were monitored with 15 h of frequent blood sampling before and during the last day of the T infusion. In the GnRH-deficient men, the first three GnRH doses were identical and were chosen to produce LH pulses with amplitudes in the midphysiological range of our normal men (i.e. a physiological dose), while the last four doses spanned 1.5 log orders (7.5, 25, 75, and 250 ng/kg). The 250 ng/kg dose was always administered last because it is known to be pharmacological. In the GnRH-deficient men, mean LH (P less than 0.02) and FSH (P less than 0.01) levels as well as LH pulse amplitude (P less than 0.05) decreased significantly during T infusion, demonstrating a direct pituitary-suppressive effect of T and/or its metabolites. Mean LH levels were suppressed to a greater extent in the normal than in the GnRH-deficient men (58 +/- 15% vs. 28 +/- 7%; P less than 0.05). In addition, LH frequency decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) during T administration in the normal men. These latter two findings suggest that T administration also suppresses hypothalamic GnRH release. T was unable to suppress gonadotropin secretion in one GnRH-deficient and one normal man. In both groups, the suppressive effect of T administration was present only in response to physiological doses of GnRH. Because the pituitary- and hypothalamus-suppressive effects of T could be mediated by its aromatization to estrogens, five GnRH-deficient and five normal men underwent identical T infusions with concomitant administration of the aromatase inhibitor testolactone (TL; 500 mg, orally, every 6 h). As an additional control, four GnRH-deficient and four normal men received TL alone. TL administration completely prevented the effect of T administration to suppress gonadotropin secretion in both the normal and GnRH-deficient men, and mean LH levels increased significantly in both the GnRH-deficient (P less than 0.01) and the normal (P less than 0.001) men who received TL alone. The increase in mean LH levels was greater (P less than 0.01) in the normal men who received TL alone than in the normal men who received T plus TL, thus revealing a direct effect of androgens in normal men. Measurements of T and estradiol production rates in three men demonstrated that TL effectively blocked aromatization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although prior studies have suggested that estrogens exert their negative feedback effect at the pituitary level in men, these conclusions have been based on models that evaluate changes in LH pulse amplitude and frequency and, therefore, only provide indirect information concerning the site of action of estrogens. To assess whether estradiol (E2) inhibits gonadotropin secretion directly and solely at the pituitary level in men, we determined the pituitary responses to physiological doses of GnRH in six men with complete GnRH deficiency, whose pituitary-gonadal function had been normalized with long term pulsatile GnRH delivery, before and during a 4-day continuous E2 infusion (90 micrograms/day). To deduce whether E2 has an additional inhibitory effect on hypothalamic GnRH secretion, their responses were compared with the effects of identical E2 infusions on spontaneous gonadotropin secretion and the responses to a 100-micrograms GnRH bolus in six normal men. Both groups were monitored with 15 h of frequent blood sampling before and during the last day of the E2 infusion. In the GnRH-deficient men, the first three GnRH doses were identical and chosen to produce LH pulses with amplitudes in the midphysiological range of values in our normal men (i.e. a physiological dose), while the last four doses spanned 1.5 log orders (7.5, 25, 75, and 250 ng/kg). The 250-ng/kg dose was always administered last because it is known to be pharmacological. In the GnRH-deficient men, mean LH and FSH levels as well as LH pulse amplitude all decreased significantly (P less than 0.02) during E2 infusion, demonstrating a direct pituitary-suppressive effect of E2. Mean LH (P less than 0.01) and FSH (P less than 0.05) levels and LH pulse amplitude (P less than 0.01) also decreased significantly in the normal men. The degree of suppression of mean LH (52 +/- 3% vs. 42 +/- 12%) and FSH (49 +/- 10% vs. 37 +/- 10%) levels was similar in the two groups. These results provide direct evidence that E2 inhibits gonadotropin secretion at the pituitary level in men and suggest that the pituitary is the most important, and possibly the sole, site of negative feedback of estrogens in men.\r"

Hormonal dynamics, particularly the relationship of FSH, estradiol, and inhibin, during and after the withdrawal of GnRH receptor blockade achieved by treatment with Nal-Glu GnRH antagonist (50 micrograms/kg, im) for 3 days in the midfollicular phase of the cycle (days 7-9) were ascertained. Daily blood samples were obtained for LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), progesterone, and immunoreactive inhibin (i-INH) measurements by RIA during 2 consecutive (control and treatment) cycles in 12 women. In 5 women, LH pulsatility was assessed by 10-min blood sampling for 12 h before, during, and after Nal-Glu treatment. The administration of Nal-Glu prolonged both follicular phase (14.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 19.7 +/- 0.8 days; P less than 0.0001) and total cycle length (28.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 34.1 +/- 1.2 days; P less than 0.0001). Gonadotropin suppression (50-60%) was achieved, as reflected by a marked decrease in mean LH levels (14.3 +/- 1.9 to 5.4 +/- 0.5; P less than 0.01) and LH pulse amplitude (5.5 +/- 0.7 to 2.4 +/- 0.3 IU/L; P less than 0.01) in response to Nal-Glu antagonist. The number of LH pulses was reduced (36%), but pulses remained discernible. Concentrations of FSH (10.8 +/- 1.4 to 5.9 +/- 0.4 IU/L; P less than 0.05), E2 (322.7 +/- 71.9 to 84.8 +/- 7.7 pmol/L; P less than 0.01) and i-INH (284.0 +/- 25.9 to 164.4 +/- 7.5 U/L; P less than 0.01) decreased concomitantly. Within 24-48 h of the last injection of Nal-Glu, all hormones had returned to pretreatment levels. This was followed by normal functional expression of follicular growth and maturation, as reflected by an increase in E2 and i-INH levels, timely ovulation, and normal luteal function. These findings indicate that an approximately 50% decline in gonadotropin support to the dominant follicle leads to functional arrest, but not demise, of the developing follicle(s) without triggering new folliculogenesis. The follicular apparatus retained its ability to reinitiate its original functionality once appropriate gonadotropin inputs were reinstated.\r"

The concentration of inhibin was compared in samples obtained from the ovarian and peripheral veins of 41 women undergoing hysterectomy. In 13 of the women, the corpus luteum was enucleated at operation and the peripheral concentration of inhibin measured at intervals for 24 h. Inhibin was assayed by a heterologous RIA using an antiserum raised against 31 kilodalton bovine inhibin. The concentrations of estradiol and progesterone in the peripheral and ovarian veins were similar to those previously reported. During the early follicular phase, the geometric mean inhibin concentrations were found to be significantly higher in both the right and left ovarian veins than the peripheral vein (180.4 and 157.7 vs. 78.7 U/L: P less than 0.02) but no difference was found in the late follicular phase between the vein draining the dominant ovary and the contralateral ovarian vein (231.1 vs. 193.4 U/L: NS). The inhibin concentrations in the veins draining the ovary bearing a corpus luteum were, however, significantly higher than those in the contralateral ovarian veins during the mid (409.1 vs. 203.6 U/L: P less than 0.02) and late (287.1 vs. 153.2 U/L: P less than 0.01) luteal phases. After enucleation of the corpus luteum, the inhibin concentration fell from the level seen before lutectomy (134.4 U/L) to 80.0 U/L at 24 h (P less than 0.01). This study demonstrates conclusively that the human corpus luteum secretes inhibin. No increase in inhibin secretion was seen from the dominant follicle in the late follicular phase. This casts doubt on the hypothesis that the selective suppression of FSH during the follicular phase is due to inhibin from the dominant follicle.\r"

It may be expected that allergen-reactive Th cells play a central role in these reactions. In the present study the occurrence and function of allergen-specific T lymphocytes in dermal inflammatory lesions were studied. To this aim panels of randomly cloned CD4+ T cells from lesional skin biopsies of two housedust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp)-allergic AD patients were screened for reactivity with Dp allergens. The results were compared with similar tests for Dp reactivity of T-lymphocyte clones (TLC) from the peripheral blood of these patients. In the panels of TLC generated from lesional skin (S-TLC), a considerable number of TLC appeared to be Dp-specific, 47% (n = 17) and 10% (n = 29), respectively. In the panels from the peripheral blood, the percentages of Dp-specific TLC were only 0% (n = 22) and 3% (n = 34), suggesting accumulation or expansion of these T cells in lesional skin. The function of these TLC was studied by assaying the secretion of IL-4 and IFN-gamma, which have been shown to be produced in aberrant ratios by Dp-specific TLC from the peripheral blood of AD patients (Wierenga et al: J Immunol 144:4651, 1990). All Dp-specific S-TLC produced IL-4 in combination with no or low levels of IFN-gamma, whereas many of the non-Dp-specific S-TLC and blood-derived TLC (B-TLC) were observed to produce high levels of IFN-gamma without significant amounts of IL-4. A functional consequence of these cytokine profiles was demonstrated by the finding that TLC producing substantial amounts of IL-4 enhanced expression of the low-affinity Fc receptor for IgE (CD23) on antigen-presenting cells to a greater extent than did IFN-gamma-producing TLC.\r"

We combined Dopa-Toluidine Blue complex stain, hair follicle split-Dopa stain, and hair follicle split-scanning electron microscope (SEM) to observe the changes of melanocytes in 23 normal, 24 vitiliginous, and 36 repigmented skin specimens. We found that only active (Dopa-positive) melanocytes existed in the epidermis of normal skin. There were some inactive (Dopa-negative) melanocytes in the outer root sheaths of normal hair follicles, which form the melanocyte reservoir in human skin. In the patients with vitiligo the active melanocytes in the epidermis were totally missing, whereas the inactive melanocytes in the outer root sheaths of hair follicles were not affected. Treatment stimulated the inactive melanocytes in the middle and/or lower parts of the outer root sheaths of hair follicles to divide, proliferate, and migrate upward along the surface of the outer root sheath to the nearby epidermis, where the melanocytes continued to migrate radially to form the pigmented island visible clinically in repigmented vitiligo lesions. During the migration to the epidermis, the melanocytes matured gradually from an inactive phase to an active condition. In conclusion, the existence of these inactive melanocytes provided the melanocyte sources for repigmentation of vitiligo.\r"

The trivalent ions of lanthanides, lanthanum, and cerium completely inhibited the ATPase staining of Langerhans cells in vitro. When mice were sensitized with dinitrofluorobenzene on skin sites pretreated with topical lanthanum chloride, and challenged on untreated ear skin, a markedly reduced contact hypersensitivity response was observed. This hyporesponsiveness was found to be antigen specific, and could be passively transferred to naive syngeneic animals recipients by CD4-CD8+ spleen cells. These results suggest that inhibition of the epidermal Langerhans cell surface ATPase by application of topical lanthanum and the induction of antigen-specific immunologic tolerance may be related events.\r"

These results indicate that Fc epsilon R2/CD23-positive LC represent a potential source of IgE-BF and that, as is observed in monocytes or U937 cells, IFN-gamma and IL-4 differently regulate the Fc epsilon R2/CD23 expression and release on LC.\r"

Routine endoscopy and biopsy of the nasopharynx were performed. All of them had surgery to the cervical lymph node. Seventy-five patients had histologically confirmed cervical TBLN. Culture of the lymph node specimen showed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 68 (90 per cent). In 45 (60 per cent) patients with cervical TBLN the primary foci of infection could not be found. Twenty-nine (39 per cent) had radiographic evidence of active or healed pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum culture from two patients showed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Five patients (six per cent) had tuberculous nasopharyngitis. In one of them (one per cent) the tuberculous nasopharyngitis was primary as no other evidence of mycobacterial infection was found. In the present study, mycobacterial infection of other parts of the upper aerodigestive tract was not found.\r"

The study included 24 biopsy specimens from 21 patients with mycosis fungoides (nine patch stage from eight patients, 13 plaque stage from 11 patients, and two tumor stage from two patients), six specimens from five patients with premycotic parapsoriasis (pre-mycosis fungoides), three specimens from three patients with lichen planus, 11 specimens from 11 patients with lupus erythematosus, 13 specimens from 13 patients with dermatitis, six specimens from six patients with drug eruptions, nine normal skin specimens from nine subjects, and three specimens from three patients with small plaque (benign) parapsoriasis. Immunoperoxidase studies using the avidin-biotin complex technique on serial frozen sections were performed. Primary antibodies were anti-human Thy-1, anti-alpha heterodimer of the TCR, anti-beta heterodimer of the TCR, and anti-delta heterodimer of the TCR. An extensive dendritic network of Thy-1+ cells was seen in all cases of mycosis fungoides. Epidermotropic cells were Thy-1 negative, and Thy-1 was expressed perivascularly in normal individuals and patients as previously reported. Epidermal gamma/delta cells were seen only in mycosis fungoides, where up to 60% of the epidermal lymphocytes expressed this TCR. The increased numbers of Thy-1 and gamma/delta T cells in mycosis fungoides were statistically significant when compared with normal skin or benign inflammatory dermatoses. The role of these dendritic dermal Thy-1+ cells and epidermal gamma/delta T cells in mycosis fungoides is unclear. The significant numbers of these potentially immunomodulating cells that were seen suggest that they are involved in the pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides.\r"

  ".W": "Various combinations of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) and percutaneous nephrostolithotomy were used in the treatment of 40 stone-containing caliceal diverticula in 39 patients (16 men and 23 women). Only 1 of 26 patients (4%) treated with ESWL as a single modality became stone-free, although 9 (36%) became asymptomatic. Ten patients undergoing ESWL primarily eventually required percutaneous nephrostolithotomy due to persistence of symptoms and all became stone-free. A total of 14 patients underwent a percutaneous approach as a single modality, and the diverticula in 13 of these patients became stone-free, although 2 patients did have residual parenchymal fragments. Therefore, 21 of 24 patients (87.5%) became completely free of stones using the percutaneous approach. All patients managed with percutaneous nephrostolithotomy became free of symptoms. The complex nature of access during percutaneous nephrostolithotomy favors a 1-stage approach with direct puncture into the stone-containing diverticulum. Simultaneous fulguration of the diverticulum at percutaneous nephrostolithotomy is favored, since all 17 patients in whom this technique was used had complete obliteration of the diverticulum on followup contrast studies. These data suggest that caliceal diverticula should be managed with percutaneous nephrostolithotomy, since ESWL monotherapy is unlikely to produce a stone-free or symptom-free status.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 4 men with benign prostatic hypertrophy who underwent medical castration therapy with a long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide) for more than 6 months elected to add an estrogen transdermal patch (0.05 mg. to the skin biweekly) to the leuprolide regimen. The average prostatic size (transrectal ultrasound), serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and symptoms of prostatism were dramatically decreased with leuprolide alone. The addition of estrogen for 6 months did not result in any change in prostate size, symptoms or serum PSA levels over that seen with leuprolide alone. The development of squamous metaplasia was noted in 1 man with leuprolide alone and in 1 man after the addition of estrogen. Immunohistochemical staining with anticytokeratin 903 antibodies reveals that squamous metaplasia appears to arise from prostatic basal cells. We postulate that the target cell for estrogen action in the prostate is the prostatic basal cell. In the absence of androgen the only direct effect of estrogens is the induction of squamous metaplasia.\r"

The bacteremia rate in the netilmycin-metronidazole group was 28% (13 of 47 patients) with a 95% confidence interval of 18 to 42% and in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group it was 37% (20 of 54) with a confidence interval of 26 to 50% (p = 0.43). None of the patients with bacteremia was symptomatic. Urinary tract infection rates were greater in the netilmycin-metronidazole group: 17% (8 of 47 patients) versus 2% (1 of 54) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group, p = 0.01.

All patients were treated with 18 mv. photon beams via a 4-field box technique. Radiation doses ranged from 5,858 to 6,900 cGy., with a mean dose of 6,456 cGy. and a median dose of 6,400 cGy. A total of 65 patients underwent extraperitoneal pelvic staging lymphadenectomy before radiotherapy. Complications noted in 42 patients were mild (generally trivial) in 23 and moderate in 19 (6.6%). There were no severe complications. The actuarial incidence of moderate complications was 9% at 5 years. Only 6 patients experienced symptoms for longer than 6 months. The risk of complications was not increased in patients who had undergone prior lymph node dissection, and only 2 of 65 had mild lymphedema, which resolved in both cases. We conclude that high energy external beam radiation for prostate cancer can be delivered with a low risk of serious complications, even in patients who have undergone extraperitoneal staging pelvic lymphadenectomy, provided the patients are treated to limited fields with high energy photons and at doses limited to 6,800 cGy. or less.\r"

In both groups the 24 hour excretion of secondary amines, nitrate, nitrite and nitrosamines was measured before and after gavage of proline and nitrate, piperazine and nitrate, N-nitrosoproline, mono-N-nitrosopiperazine. The urinary nitrosamine concentrations were not significantly different between both groups neither before nor after application of the several substances. Thirty rats were randomized into two vesicosigmoidostomy groups with and without antibiotic coverage and an unoperated control group. After ligation of distal rectum and mesosigmoid the rectosigmoids were removed. No significant concentrations of volatile nitrosamines could be measured in the rectosigmoid contents of the three groups. One hundred and twenty rats randomized into three groups following vesicosigmoidostomy received the potential nitrosamine antidotes sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate or sodiumpentosan-polysulfate or acted as controls. 12/118 (10.2%) developed adenomas and 25/118 (21.2%) adenocarcinomas at the vesico-colonic anastomosis with no significant differences between the three groups concerning tumor incidence or mortality. The results show that colon carcinomas occur in a rat model for ureterosigmoidostomy without evidence for thus induced nitrosamine formation. This and the missing effect of nitrosamine antidotes suggest that other factors than nitrosation must be responsible for colon carcinogenesis following urinary diversion via intestine.\r"

U-PA was determined by a competition RIA, t-PA by an ELISA and PAI by a spectrophotometric assay. 15 patients showed normozoospermia, 11 azoospermia and 41 oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT-syndrome). In lysates of spermatozoas, significantly higher levels of both plasminogenactivators and PAI were found in patients with OAT syndrome as compared to those exhibiting normozoospermia. Whereas PAI was absent in the seminal plasma of normozoospermic ejaculate, patients with azoospermia (180 +/- 13 mU/ml.) and OAT-syndrome (60 +/- 5 mU/ml.) showed high PAI levels. The similarly high values of t-PA (190.8-227.8 ng./ml.) and u-PA (19.4-32 ng./ml.) in the same compartment confirm their predominantly prostatic origin and seem to have no influence on the quality of the ejaculate.\r"

Functional expression of cloned mammalian K+ channels has provided a tool for studying their regulation at the molecular level. We report here that fast-inactivating K+ currents mediated by cloned K+ channel subunits derived from mammalian brain expressed in Xenopus oocytes are regulated by the reducing agent glutathione. This type of regulation may have a role in vivo to link metabolism to excitability and to regulate excitability in specific membrane areas of mammalian neurons.\r"

Although the alpha 3 domain of class I is not involved in peptide binding, it does interact with the T-cell accessory molecule, CD8. CD8 is important in the selection of T cells as anti-CD8 antibody injected into perinatal mice interferes with this process. We previously used a hybrid class I molecule with the alpha 1/alpha 2 domains from Ld and the alpha 3 domain from Q7b and showed that this molecule binds an Ld-restricted peptide but does not interact with CD8-dependent cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Expression of this molecule in transgenic mice fails to negatively select a subpopulation of anti-Ld cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In addition, positive selection of virus-specific Ld-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes does not occur. We conclude that besides the alpha 1/alpha 2 domains of class I, the alpha 3 domain plays an important part in both positive and negative selection of antigen-specific cells.\r"

Analysis of thymic selection in mice transgenic for T cell-receptor genes or for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, or mice injected with antibodies against CD8, CD4 or MHC molecules, is consistent with the participation of CD8 and CD4 in thymic selection. But antibody-mediated crosslinking of surface receptors in thymic organ cultures has indicated that CD8 is not involved in thymic deletion. We show here that mice transgenic for a mutant MHC class I molecule that cannot interact with CD8 do not delete CD8-dependent T cells reactive with the wild-type molecule. This finding unequivocally establishes that for negative selection in the thymus, CD8 must interact with the same MHC class I molecule as the T cell receptor.\r"

  ".U": "91343002\r", 
  ".W": "The complementary DNA sequence encoding the cell-surface receptor for ecotropic host-range murine retroviruses (ecoR) shows that it contains 622 amino acids and 14 hydrophobic potentially membrane-spanning sequences. Because this receptor occurs on many or all murine cells and is probably essential for viability of cultured fibroblasts, its normal function might be to transport an essential metabolite. We expressed ecoR in Xenopus laevis oocytes by injecting RNA transcribed from the cloned cDNA. These oocytes specifically bound the gp70 envelope glycoprotein from an ecotropic murine leukaemia virus. An inward current was recorded electrophysiologically when a mixture of amino-acids was applied: this resulted from a stereoselective, saturable uptake of lysine, arginine and ornithine; it was independent of sodium and not substantially altered by gp70. Cysteine and homoserine were also taken up, but sodium was necessary for their transport. These properties of ecoR correspond to those of the y+ amino-acid transporter. Our results demonstrate the subversion of a ubiquitous cell membrane protein, in this case a basic amino acid transporter, for use as a retroviral receptor.\r"

  ".U": "91343005\r", 
  ".W": "The phosphorylation of proteins at tyrosine residues is critical in cellular signal transduction, neoplastic transformation and control of the mitotic cycle. These mechanisms are regulated by the activities of both protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). As in the PTKs, there are two classes of PTPases: membrane associated, receptor-like enzymes and soluble proteins. Here we report the isolation of a complementary DNA clone encoding a new form of soluble PTPase, PTP1C. The enzyme possesses a large noncatalytic region at the N terminus which unexpectedly contains two adjacent copies of the Src homology region 2 (the SH2 domain) found in various nonreceptor PTKs and other cytoplasmic signalling proteins. As with other SH2 sequences, the SH2 domains of PTP1C formed high-affinity complexes with the activated epidermal growth factor receptor and other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. These results suggest that the SH2 regions in PTP1C may interact with other cellular components to modulate its own phosphatase activity against interacting substrates. PTPase activity may thus directly link growth factor receptors and other signalling proteins through protein-tyrosine phosphorylation.\r"

Many studies have identified institutional barriers against access to care as a major cause. To overcome these barriers, Public Health District V, South Central Idaho, has created a comprehensive prenatal health care model that has almost tripled participation in its program during the first year of implementation and increased it again significantly during the second year. This decentralized pregnancy program has succeeded in getting all of the physicians offering obstetrical care in the district to serve low-income pregnant clients on a rotating basis. The new program provides pregnancy testing as well as financial screening services. Also, it has combined support services into one-stop-shopping clinics that include an innovative expansion of the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. WIC food vouchers help attract clients into the prenatal care system and keep them coming. Enrichment of the duties of the public health nurse provides case coordination that pulls together the patchwork of medical and support services for the pregnant client.\r"

There was no association between the severity of abuse and the time lapsed in seeking help from an agency, indicating that women exposed to severe, life-threatening physical abuse frequently delay help seeking. Increased attention to barrier to help seeking among battered women and approaches to increasing the accessibility of services for battered women seem warranted.\r"

  ".U": "91343686\r", 
  ".W": "This review discusses nutrition and related health problems among homeless Americans, summarizes recent information, and identifies needs for services and future research. The nature of homelessness today provides a context for the discussion. Many homeless persons eat fewer meals per day, lack food more often, and are more likely to have inadequate diets and poorer nutritional status than housed U.S. populations. Yet many homeless people eligible for food stamps do not receive them. While public and private agencies provide nutritious food and meals for homeless persons, availability of the services to homeless persons is limited. Many homeless people lack appropriate health care, and certain nutrition-related health problems are prevalent among them. Compared with housed populations, alcoholism, anemia, and growth problems are more common among homeless persons, and pregnancy rates are higher. The risks vary among homeless persons for malnutrition, nutrition-related health problems, drug and alcohol abuse, and mental illness. For example, among homeless persons, fewer heads of families than single adults are substance abusers, and mental illness varies in prevalence among single men, single women, and parents in homeless families. Homeless persons need improved access to food, nutrition, and health services. More nutrition education needs to be available to them and to service providers. Use of representative samples and validation of self-reported nutrition and health data will help future investigators to clarify the relationships between the characteristics of the homeless and their nutritional status.\r"

The need to develop geriatric programs within C/MHCs is clear. Less clear is how and under what circumstances a comprehensive geriatric program can be adequately financed. The Health Resources and Services Administration of the Public Health Service contracted with La Jolla Management Corporation and Duke University Center on Aging to identify successful techniques for obtaining funding by examining 10 \"good practice\" C/MHC geriatric programs. The results from this study indicated that effective techniques included using a variety of funding sources, maintaining accurate cost-per-user information, developing a marketing strategy and user incentives, collaborating with the area agency on aging and other community organizations, and developing special services for the elderly. Developing cost-per-user information allowed for identifying appropriate \"drawing card\" services, negotiating sound reimbursement rates and contracts with other providers, and assessing the financial impact of changing service mixes. A marketing strategy was used to enhance the ability of the centers to provide a comprehensive package of services. Collaboration with the area agency on aging and other community organizations and volunteers in the aging network was found to help establish referral networks and subsequently increase the number of elderly patients served. Finally, development of special services for the elderly, such as adult day care, case management, and health education, was found to increase program visibility, opportunities to work with the network of services for the aging, and clinical utilization.\r"

  ".W": "An evaluation was made of the use of telephone survey methods to collect illicit drug use data. Using data from a national survey that collects data by personal interviews, marijuana and cocaine use prevalence rates among households with telephones and those without were compared in order to assess coverage errors in telephone surveys. Drug use rates were substantially higher among households without telephones, with 24.9 percent of those living in households without telephones reporting use of marijuana in the past year, compared with only 9.4 percent of persons living in households with telephones. Trends in drug use were divergent, with substantial decreases in use occurring between 1985 and 1988 in households with telephones, but not in those without. National prevalence patterns and trends among households with telephone appear to be consistent with national patterns and trends in the total household population, because about 93 percent of the population lives in households with telephones. However, surveys conducted by telephone were found to produce underestimates of illicit drug use prevalence. In a 1988 national telephone survey, estimated rates of past year use were 5.2 percent for marijuana and 1.4 percent for cocaine. Comparable data from a personal visit survey (including only households with telephones and reedited and reweighted to control for differences in data collection protocols) were 8.0 percent for marijuana and 3.1 percent for cocaine use. Comparisons with several other telephone surveys collecting illicit drug use data showed similar results. Based on these results, researchers are advised to use caution in using telephone surveys to produce drug use prevalence estimates.\r"

Overall, U.S. blacks are more likely to be hypertensive than whites, but the degree to which this is true among women of childbearing age (including teenagers) is unknown. Using data from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), the authors describe hypertension prevalence rates for 422 black and 2,700 white reproductive-age women. The authors present observed data and also predicted prevalence rates derived by modeling the odds of hypertension using logistic regression statistical techniques. They find that black-white differences in hypertension prevalence are negligible among teenagers, but they are pronounced in the older reproductive ages. They estimate that twice the proportion of black women relative to white are hypertensive during pregnancy. Their results suggest that differential rates of hypertension between black and white women may contribute to the persistent excess infant mortality among blacks, but conclusive results cannot be determined from these data. These data are also valuable for the design and evaluation of screening, intervention, and followup programs for hypertensive disease among young women.\r"

At ages 12-17 and 18-24, blood pressure and body temperature showed consistent, independent, positive associations with pulse rate in whites. However, relatively little of the overall variation in pulse rate was explained by measured variables in multivariate regression analyses. Mother-child, age-specific correlation coefficients for pulse and blood pressure were generally positive. Further research is needed on the associations of resting pulse rate with sex, race, and blood pressure and with subsequent cardiovascular morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "In late 1987, a total of 852 Rhode Island women ages 40 and older were interviewed by telephone (78 percent response rate) to measure their use of breast cancer screening and to investigate potential predictors of use. Predictors included the women's socioeconomic status, use of medical care, a provider's reported recommendations for screening, and the women's health beliefs about breast cancer and mammography. The Health Belief Model guided the construction of the interview questions and data analysis. Logistic regression was used to identify leading independent predictors of breast cancer screening according to contemporary recommendations: reporting that a medical provider had ever recommended a screening mammogram (odds ratio [OR] = 18.77), having received gynecological care in the previous year (OR = 4.92), having a regular source of gynecological care (OR = 2.63), having ever had a diagnostic mammogram (OR = 2.32), and perceiving mammography as safe enough to have annually (OR = 1.93). The findings suggest that programs intended to increase the use of breast cancer screening should include \"inreach\" and \"outreach\" elements; inreach to patients with established patient-provider relationships, by assuring that physicians recommend screening to all eligible patients, and outreach to all eligible women, by helping them overcome barriers to effective primary care, and by promoting mammography, emphasizing its effectiveness and safety. The findings also suggest that socioeconomically disadvantaged women, who are less likely to be screened than other women, should become special targets of inreach and outreach interventions.\r"

As this minority group continues to increase in numbers, pertinent information about their perinatal health problems in the context of their sociocultural characteristics will be required. This review examines critically the recent literature related to low birth weight and prenatal care and suggests alternative ways to address these perinatal health issues. Low birth weight is examined in the context of the problem of intrauterine growth retardation and the potential mechanisms and consequences of different types of growth limitation in utero which have not been studied in this population. The use of prenatal care by Mexican American women and its association with birth weight is examined as an indication of maternal behavior or as a health care intervention. The implications for public health policy are discussed in relation to the identification, interpretation, and evaluation of these perinatal health issues in this minority population.\r"

A substantial improvement was seen in the relative risk for injury in the intervention as compared with control communities. The major intervention was a pediatric counseling program taking place within a context of various community education efforts. Process data on patient satisfaction and physician compliance, and educational and behavioral outcomes from previously reported studies, when combined with injury incidence data in this report, support the hypothesis that physician counseling may be an important factor in the favorable results observed in these suburban communities. These data also suggest that a decrease in injury incidence may be possible when interactive physician counseling takes place within the context of community education programs. A comprehensive strategy that includes technological, legislative, and educational activities is suggested as the optimal approach to childhood injury prevention.\r"

The mortality related measures--mortality, YPLL, and indirect mortality costs--are computed for 35 diagnoses related to alcohol use and misuse. A review of clinical research studies and injury surveillance studies was conducted to produce estimates of the alcohol-attributable fraction (AAF) for each diagnosis. For these measures, age-specific and age-adjusted rates are also calculated. Health care costs, morbidity costs, and nonhealth-sector costs are prorated from national studies to the State or locality. This multiple-measure approach to quantifying a health problem is termed \"disease impact estimation.\" National estimates of the disease impact of alcohol use and misuse have been produced using ARDI software and State-specific estimates are in preparation. Designed to CDC specifications, ARDI is completely menu-driven and operates within Lotus 1-2-3 software as a set of linked spreadsheets. ARDI adapts national epidemiologic and health economics methods for use by State and local health agencies. ARDI produces data on the health consequences of alcohol use and misuse for use by locally based policymakers, public health professionals, and researchers, while permitting comparison and compilation of these data across jurisdictions.\r"

  ".W": "Serum specimens obtained from a nationwide sample of parenteral drug abusers (PDAs) during the period 1971-72 had previously been screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies. Some specimens were considered to be positive to both ELISA and Western blot (WB) analysis. These findings have been a topic of controversy, since HIV was not thought to have penetrated at-risk populations at such an early date. This study was a followup of those PDAs with apparent seropositivity to WB analysis. Of 10 persons followed, only one death (in 1985) was documented, and postmortem findings were inconsistent with HIV infection. Eight of the remaining PDAs were traced and found to be alive and well in 1989. Fresh specimens were obtained from the two persons with the strongest 1971-72 WB staining and were found to be both ELISA and WB negative on retesting. Their T-cell parameters were within normal limits. We concluded that the earlier WB results were most likely false positives and that definitive evidence of HIV infection in the U.S. addict population as early as 1971-72 is still lacking.\r"

  ".W": "A national telephone survey of eye care practitioners shows that the average fee for routine eye examinations was less among optometrists than ophthalmologists. The average wait for the earliest appointment was 5 days for optometrists and 20 days for ophthalmologists. Weekend and evening appointments were also more obtainable among optometrists. The study did not determine what tests were included in the routine examination of each practitioner. Optometrists are licensed to use diagnostic drugs in all 50 States and prescribe therapeutic drugs for the treatment of ocular diseases in 25 States. Legislation that would update State laws permitting doctors of optometry to prescribe and use pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of eye diseases has been introduced in many of the remaining States. Supporters of bills permitting therapeutic pharmaceutical optometry contend that these changes would ensure the availability of quality eye care at significant savings, since optometric fees are generally lower than ophthalmological fees. In addition, it has been argued that optometrists are equitably distributed geographically and are more likely to have weekend and evening office hours, thus enabling increased patient access to eye care. When considering cost-effectiveness and accessibility, this study may provide information to those States considering changes in the scope of optometric licensure.\r"

Clearly, health communication plays an important role in the development of AIDS prevention programs directed at IV drug users. However, few public information campaigns have been developed to reach IV drug users or their sexual partners. In a recent campaign directed at these groups, the selection of messages to be used was based both on theory and on research into multi-media public information campaigns. The attempt was made to communicate basic facts about AIDS etiology and prevention. This included information that needle sharing and unprotected sex could spread the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, while bleaching needles and using condoms properly could reduce the risk of infection. A step-by-step diagram on how to bleach needles was provided. Posters, pamphlets, billboards, and out-reach workers were used to spread the word in inner-city neighbors, and coverage of the campaign was sought in the news media. Strategies incorporating practical and theory-based suggestions for future campaigns on IV drug use and AIDS are discussed.\r"

In vitro, both drugs bind and inhibit the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) proline rotamase. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with rapamycin irreversibly arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. An FKBP-rapamycin complex is concluded to be the toxic agent because (i) strains that lack FKBP proline rotamase, encoded by FPR1, were viable and fully resistant to rapamycin and (ii) FK506 antagonized rapamycin toxicity in vivo. Mutations that conferred rapamycin resistance altered conserved residues in FKBP that are critical for drug binding. Two genes other than FPR1, named TOR1 and TOR2, that participate in rapamycin toxicity were identified. Nonallelic noncomplementation between FPR1, TOR1, and TOR2 alleles suggests that the products of these genes may interact as subunits of a protein complex. Such a complex may mediate nuclear entry of signals required for progression through the cell cycle.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of oral almitrine bismesylate, a respiratory stimulant that acts on peripheral arterial chemoreceptors, was studied in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease and hypoxaemic cor pulmonale. Twenty three patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of ventilatory failure were randomised to receive either almitrine 100 mg twice a day reducing to 50 mg twice a day over 48 hours or placebo in addition to conventional treatment. On admission the mean (SE) values for blood gas tensions were PaO2 4.8 (0.3) and PaCO2 7.7 (0.3) kPa in the 12 patients who received almitrine and PaO2 4.9 (0.1) and PaCO2 7.6 (0.3) kPa in the 11 who received placebo. After three hours of oxygen therapy at 1 1/min there was a similar rise in PaO2 in both groups, 6.4 (0.2) kPa in those receiving almitrine and 6.6 (0.4) kPa in those receiving placebo. After 24 hours of oxygen therapy values of PaO2 were again similar at 6.3 (0.8) kPa and 6.7 (2.2) kPa respectively. Arterial blood gas tensions improved during the study in those who survived but no significant differences were apparent between the two groups. There were six deaths, five in the almitrine group and one in the placebo group. There were no differences between the groups in respiratory rate, results of spirometry, oxygen requirement, or degree of dyspnoea (on visual analogue scale). The results did not show any benefit from oral almitrine in patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to chronic obstructive airways disease. Plasma almitrine concentrations, however, were often below the optimum therapeutic range, suggesting impaired drug absorption.\r"

  ".W": "Poloxamer 188 has been reported to inhibit thrombosis, decrease whole blood viscosity, and improve perfusion of damaged tissue. Mannitol has free radical scavenging capabilities that might contribute to myocardial salvage after ischemia. Because these agents appear to work in different ways, we studied their cardioprotective properties when they were used separately and in combination. After 75 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion, dogs received poloxamer 188 (48 mg/kg), mannitol (0.5 gm/kg), or both intravenously during an additional 15 minutes of LAD occlusion and for 45 minutes of reperfusion, whereas control dogs received an equal volume of saline solution. After surgery the animals were maintained for 24 hours and then killed. Areas of myocardial infarction (MI) and risk of infarction (R) were calculated by means of planimetric analysis of slices of myocardium stained with 1.5% triphenyltetrazolium and 0.5% Evans blue dye. The ratio of MI/R (mean +/- standard error of the mean) were: control, 25.6 +/- 1.8% (n = 10); poloxamer 188, 12.7 +/- 2.0% (n = 10); mannitol, 10.6 +/- 2.5% (n = 11); and poloxamer 188 plus mannitol, 8.0 +/- 4.1% (n = 10). Measurement of microvascular blood flow indicated a similar 86% to 91% reduction of blood flow to the area at risk in all treatment groups. Consequently both poloxamer 188 and mannitol appear to increase salvage of ischemic myocardium and a combination of the two may be more effective than either agent alone.\r"

In all, there were 646 ischemic episodes detected with ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring during the study period, and 618 episodes of them occurred during placebo periods with a circadian variation. Sixty-nine percent of the episodes in placebo periods were asymptomatic. The number of anginal attacks, nitroglycerin tablets taken, ST-segment elevation and the total ischemic duration significantly decreased during nifedipine therapy compared with results after the placebo therapy period, respectively (p less than 0.01 or 0.05). Twenty-eight ischemic episodes occurred during nifedipine therapy when the plasma level of nifedipine was low. Thus, asymptomatic ischemic episodes more frequently occur than symptomatic episodes and the administration of slow-release nifedipine is highly effective in suppressing not only symptomatic but also asymptomatic myocardial ischemia in patients with variant angina. The timing of the administration of slow-release nifedipine is an important factor in suppressing ischemic episodes.\r"

  ".W": "Several sources of information suggest that man evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids of approximately 1 whereas today this ratio is approximately 10:1 to 20-25:1, indicating that Western diets are deficient in omega 3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their genetic patterns were established. Omega-3 fatty acids increase bleeding time; decrease platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and fibrinogen; and increase erythrocyte deformability, thus decreasing the tendency to thrombus formation. In no clinical trial, including coronary artery graft surgery, has there been any evidence of increased blood loss due to ingestion of omega 3 fatty acids. Many studies show that the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on serum lipids depend on the type of patient and whether the amount of saturated fatty acids in the diet is held constant. In patients with hyperlipidemia, omega 3 fatty acids decrease low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol if the saturated fatty acid content is decreased, otherwise there is a slight increase, but at high doses (32 g) they lower LDL cholesterol; furthermore, they consistently lower serum triglycerides in normal subjects and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia whereas the effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) varies from no effect to slight increases. The discrepancies between animal and human studies most likely are due to differences between animal and human metabolism. In clinical trials eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of fish oils along with antirheumatic drugs improve joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; have a beneficial effect in patients with ulcerative colitis; and in combination with drugs, improve the skin lesions, lower the hyperlipidemia from etretinates, and decrease the toxicity of cyclosporin in patients with psoriasis. In various animal models omega 3 fatty acids decrease the number and size of tumors and increase the time elapsed before appearance of tumors. Studies with nonhuman primates and human newborns indicate that DHA is essential for the normal functional development of the retina and brain, particularly in premature infants. Because omega 3 fatty acids are essential in growth and development throughout the life cycle, they should be included in the diets of all humans. Omega-3 and omega 6 fatty acids are not interconvertible in the human body and are important components of practically all cell membranes. Whereas cellular proteins are genetically determined, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of cell membranes is to a great extent dependent on the dietary intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This study describes the metabolic use of fuels, as assessed by indirect calorimetry, in eight stable, ambulatory, noncancerous, adult patients receiving glucose-based PN with (PN + oral) or without (PN only) a self-selected oral intake. Patients' weight was 91 +/- 2% (mean +/- SE) of ideal body weight, and fat mass was 22 +/- 5 and 31 +/- 2% of actual body weight in males and females, respectively. Under the PN-only regimen, providing 104 +/- 5% of predicted basal energy expenditure (BEE), patients were in equilibrium for energy and nitrogen balances. Oral supplementation (absorbed oral intake 80 +/- 5% of BEE) was associated with positive energy and nitrogen balances but also with nearly continuous net fat synthesis. We conclude that the glucose-based PN + mixed oral regimen enables the patients to face the increased energy requirements of everyday ambulatory life but is not associated with an optimal body composition in long-term PN patients.\r"

Measurements were made before and during the first 2 wk of TPN administration. We measured the pH of our standard TPN solution with and without the addition of cysteine. Serum carbon dioxide was significantly lower in group C despite a significantly greater intake of acetate in group NC. In the in vitro study the addition of cysteine to the TPN solution lowered the pH from 5.5 to 5.1. Newborns who received TPN solutions to which cysteine was added had lower serum carbon dioxide values and a greater need to receive acetate than did newborns who received TPN solutions without cysteine.\r"

Of the 11 leishmaniasis sera studied, four had IgG-SC, two had IgA-SC, and five had IgM-SC. Of the eight Yanomamo Indians infected by Onchocerca volvulus, three were found to have IgG-SC, two had IgM-SC, and two had IgA-SC. Thirteen sera from healthy individuals living in an endemic area were also studied. One subject had IgG IgM and IgA-SC. The results presented in this study show for the first time, the specific detection of IgM, IgG, and IgA immune complexes using a MAb against T. cruzi. The presence of the epitope in association with IgM antibodies in sera from patients with the acute phase of the disease suggests that this antigen(s) carrying the epitope that reacts with the MAb could be a marker(s) of active infection. In addition, the specificity of the serum complex capture assay allowed the detection of Chagas' disease in two different endemic areas (Argentina and Venezuela).\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: To estimate the mean cost of initial medical treatment for a variety of injury types and injury causes and project the national cost of initial medical care for injuries to children. DESIGN: We combined injury incidence data from the Massachusetts Statewide Childhood Injury Prevention Project (SCIPP) with a claims data set (1987 charges) from the Health Data Institute, Lexington, Massachusetts. SETTING AND STUDY POPULATION: SCIPP incidence data were obtained from hospital emergency department and inpatient facilities for a population of 87,000 Massachusetts children 0 to 19 years old between 1979 and 1982. Health Data Institute charge data for children were derived from insurance claims for 3% of all privately insured patients throughout the United States. RESULTS: The estimated mean cost of initial hospitalization for injury was $5,094, while ED care was $171. Projected annual cost for initial medical care of injury to children for the nation was $5.1 billion, which was about equally divided between cases seen in EDs and those requiring inpatient care. Although there was little difference in mean cost between the genders, mean cost increased with age. Because of both a higher injury incidence and a greater mean cost per injury, the projected initial cost of injuries to teenagers 15 to 19 years old was much higher than that of younger children. CONCLUSION: Expenditures for medical care of injured children, particularly adolescents, are great. The prevention of childhood injuries should become a higher priority in the United States. To improve the quality of national estimates of the incidence and cost of injury, a national surveillance system for nonfatal injuries should be developed. Such a system should include information on the major causes of injury and their costs.\r"

The frequency of a positive result in the cirrhotics was significantly higher than in the alcoholics without cirrhosis (38.5% vs 8.8%, P less than 0.01). However, the positive results in the cirrhotics were associated with high gammaglobulin concentrations, and optical density values in the assay correlated closely with serum globulin (r = 0.73, P less than 0.01). The findings suggest that serum from patients with alcoholic cirrhosis may contain a component that give false-positive results in the assay.\r"

Substantial reactivity was also evidenced for the amine-containing penicillins cyclacillin and ampicillin and for the cephalosporins cephalexin, cephradroxyl and cephradine. However, the virtual lack of reactivity of the amine-containing penicillanic and cephalosporanic acids reveals a major role of the acyl groups of these antibiotics in their reactivity towards acetaldehyde. The presence of moieties which increase the electron density of the amine group appears to favour the molecule reactivity. Amongst several phenylethylamines tested, dopamine and noradrenaline were the most active in forming adducts with acetaldehyde. It is suggested that in vitro binding of acetaldehyde to the above-mentioned drugs could lead in vivo to decreased drug bioavailability, and conceivably the adducts formed may mediate some of the side effects associated with simultaneous drug and alcohol ingestion.\r"

  ".U": "91346834\r", 
  ".W": "G proteins mediate the interaction between cell surface receptors and intracellular effectors. Recent studies have shown that human retina and rat brain contain mRNA encoding a novel 40-Kd G protein alpha subunit referred to as Gz alpha. Studies with an antiserum selective for the predicted sequence of this protein have suggested that a similar protein is present in human platelets and is phosphorylated during platelet activation. To better understand the structure and function of this protein, the present studies examine its sequence in platelets and compare its abundance in human platelets, megakaryocytes, and two megakaryoblastic cell lines, HEL cells and Dami cells. Three different Gz alpha-selective antisera reacted with a 40-Kd protein in platelet membranes. None of these detected a corresponding protein in HEL or Dami cells, despite the presence in both cell lines of proteins recognized by antisera selective for three members of the Gi alpha family. Northern blotting with a Gz alpha-specific probe prepared from retinal Gz alpha showed two hybridizing species in platelet RNA: a major band at 3.5 kb and a minor band at 2.2 kb. Both were detectable in HEL and Dami cells, but at greatly reduced levels compared with platelets. RNA encoding Gz alpha was also detected in individual human megakaryocytes by in situ hybridization. The amount present approached that of Gi alpha 2' the most abundant of the Gi alpha species present in platelets. The complete sequence of the platelet homolog to Gz alpha was determined from platelet RNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The encoded protein was the same as those obtained in brain and retina. Thus, based on immunoreactivity and nucleotide sequencing, platelets and megakaryocytes contain substantial quantities of a protein identical to brain and retinal Gz alpha. The paucity of Gz alpha protein and RNA in the megakaryoblastic cell lines suggests that either there has been a selective loss of the ability to synthesize Gz alpha from these cells or that Gz alpha appears at a later stage in megakaryocyte development than does Gi alpha.\r"

  ".W": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) is the fast-acting inhibitor of both tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators (t-PA, u-PA) and is an essential regulatory protein of the fibrinolytic system. In the presence of either the protein vitronectin or the glycosaminoglycan heparin, PAI-1 is also an efficient inhibitor of thrombin. To assess whether these cofactors turn PAI-1 into a general protease inhibitor or whether their influence is restricted to thrombin, the second-order association rate constants between PAI-1 and the human plasma proteases t-PA, u-PA, plasmin, thrombin, Factor Xa (FXa), and Factor XIIa (FXIIa) in the absence and in the presence of either vitronectin or heparin are determined. In addition, the role of the PAI-1 reactive site P3 to P3' residues for the specificity of inhibition was studied by using PAI-1 reactive site mutants. Our results show that: (1) Heparin exclusively increases the rate of inhibition of thrombin by PAI-1, whereas in the presence of heparin the rate of inhibition of the other proteases is not altered; (2) Vitronectin is an obligatory cofactor for the inhibition of thrombin by PAI-1. In addition, vitronectin moderately increases the rate of inhibition by PAI-1 of u-PA and of plasmin, but does not alter the rate of inhibition of t-PA, FXa, or FXIIa; (3) Apart from the important role of the P1 residue, no consensus can be presented on the nature of other residues within the P3 to P3' region with regard to target protease specificity.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to analyze at the clonal level the phenotype and functions of T cells from patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). For this purpose we studied 175 T-cell clones obtained from peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of four SAA patients and 97 clones from two healthy controls. The percentage of CD8+ T-cell clones obtained from the patients' PB and BM was higher, but not significantly (P = .07 and P = .14, respectively), than that obtained in controls. A higher proportion of T-cell clones from SAA patients exhibited lectin-dependent cytolytic activity and especially natural killer-like activity when compared with controls (PB: P less than .01, P less than .05; BM: P less than .05, P less than .01, respectively). Lymphokine release was tested before and after mitogen stimulation. A number of patients' clones were able to release interferons (IFNs) spontaneously (PB: 28.6% v 0%, P less than .05; BM: 28.6% v 0%, P less than .10). After mitogen stimulation, patients' BM T-cell clones produced IFNs in greater proportions (90.9% v 46.7%, P less than .01) and in greater quantities (PB: 25.5 arbitrary units [AU]/mL v 5.7 AU/mL, P less than .03; BM: 26 AU/mL v 9.1 AU/mL, P = .011) as compared with controls. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity was not found in supernatants of unprimed T-cell clones. After mitogen stimulation, PB T-cell microcultures produced TNF alpha in greater proportions (97.9% v 72.2%, P less than .01) and, also in this case, in greater quantities (PB: 7.2 AU/mL v 1.5 AU/mL, P = .007; BM: 9.9 AU/mL v 1.5 AU/mL, P = .003) than controls. In conclusion, T-cell clones from SAA patients exhibit predominantly a CD8+ phenotype, a greater cytotoxic activity, and can be shown to produce greater quantities of suppressor lymphokines when compared with controls.\r"

While 15 expressed two or more T-cell antigens, five were found to express only CD7. All patients belonged to the French-American-British type M4, and four were under the age of 40. Despite intensive chemotherapy, four never obtained a complete remission and the fifth died of relapse after an allogenic bone marrow transplantation. While 12 randomly selected T-cell antigen negative AML patients showed only few rearrangements in Ig- or T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, such genetic alterations were demonstrated in four of five patients for the TCR delta gene and in all patients for the TCR beta gene. Interestingly, DNA fragments of similar size were demonstrated in three of five patients for both the beta and delta genes. These data suggest that the solitary presence of CD7 among T-cell antigens in otherwise clearcut AML cases identifies a group of patients with similarities in antigen receptor gene configuration as well as outcome.\r"

Of 18 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and 11 peripheral T-cell lymphomas, none expressed IL-9 message. By contrast, IL-9 message was found in two of six cases of large cell anaplastic lymphoma (LCAL) and in 6 of 13 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD). In HD the strongest signals were observed in Hodgkin (H) and Sternberg-Reed (SR) cells, but IL-9 mRNA was also detected in small lymphocytic cells. A search for IL-9 message in a panel of 20 cell lines derived both from hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tumors confirmed the unique association of IL-9 expression with HD and LCAL in as much as the only two cell lines with IL-9 message were derived from cases of HD and LCAL. These results suggest that IL-9 is not involved as an autocrine growth factor in the pathogenesis of most B- and T-cell lymphomas, but that it may play a role in HD and LCAL.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes a novel assay involving the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RNase protection for the rapid and sensitive detection of malignant lymphoid cells by nucleotide sequences within their individual rearranged gamma T-cell receptor (TCRG) genes. In this assay, clonal rearrangements are amplified from the DNA of diagnostic tumor specimens using a consensus V segment primer and a consensus J segment primer to which the promoter for T7 RNA polymerase has been appended. The PCR product from this amplification is transcribed into a radiolabeled RNA probe. Test RNA transcribed from the opposite DNA strand is synthesized by similar methods from TCRG genes of a subsequent biopsy specimen. The test RNA is hybridized with the probe, and mismatched nucleotide sequences in the RNA hybrids are digested by RNase A. Detection of fully protected probe by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography indicates the presence of malignant cells in the test specimen. Dilution experiments with DNA of cell lines from acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) show that detection of one tumor cell among 10(5) normal bone marrow cells is usually possible. Residual disease was also successfully detected in several cases of ALL during clinical remission, including detection in one case at the 10(-5) level. The procedure described here may provide a simplified and rapid method for the sensitive diagnosis and monitoring of lymphoid malignancies. This procedure should be applicable to most antigen receptor genes, and unlike most comparable methods, requires neither analysis of nucleotide sequence nor synthesis of tumor-specific oligonucleotide probes or primers.\r"

  ".W": "Persistent low serum levels of one or several immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses can be found in a high proportion of adult patients with increased susceptibility to infections. It is hard to envision that the low subclass level in itself is responsible for this susceptibility because healthy blood donors have been described who are completely devoid of certain subclasses in serum. This apparent discrepancy may be partly explained by the observation that most subclass-deficient patients have underlying aberrations in T-cell and B-cell interaction and function that may impair their capacity to compensate for even minor deficiencies. A prospective blind crossover study of the effect of prophylactic Ig substitution therapy was done in 43 adult patients with IgG subclass deficiency. The patients were randomized to receive 1 year of therapy with intramuscular Ig 25 mg/kg/wk or 1 year of saline injections. A significant protective effect of the prophylactic Ig therapy was seen with a great reduction in the number of days of infection. In addition, several immunologic parameters were altered after 1 year of Ig therapy. Nineteen of the patients later were included in an open study using 50 mg/kg/wk of Ig. After 6 months of treatment, significant protection against infection was observed, with a reduction of 6.2 days in the number of days per month with infection. This marked effect of prophylactic Ig suggests that the Ig aberrations seen in IgG subclass-deficient patients contributed to their susceptibility to infection. The effect of 25 mg/kg/wk was much less pronounced than that of 50 mg/kg/wk, and normal serum IgG subclass levels were not achieved even during the higher-dose therapy. However, it seems likely that subcutaneous or intravenous administration of larger doses of Ig would allow for more efficient therapy.\r"

It also is used to modify graft versus host disease (GVHD) and decrease infections other than CMV. Another use is to treat autoimmune complications of bone marrow transplants. The data are reviewed indicating that IVIG decreases CMV-related interstitial pneumonia. Part of this efficacy may be a direct antiviral effect; decreasing GVHD and modifying the immune response to CMV-infected lung cells also may be important. Some studies suggest that IVIG and ganciclovir are effective therapy of CMV-related interstitial pneumonia. Results suggesting that IVIG administration decreases infections other than CMV are less convincing. There is little information regarding IVIG therapy of autoimmune transplant complications. These uses of IVIG are reviewed in the context of other potential interventions, and future research directions are defined.\r"

The challenge for the 1990's is not only to continue to better define the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation services, but more urgently, how to deliver effective services most efficiently. This will help physicians provide optimum care for their patients, will improve the patient's likelihood of regaining for themselves an active and productive life, and should generate a more equitable and accountable reimbursement system for quality health care.\r"

Although the acuity of nursing home residents has increased significantly since the introduction of PPS, full-time registered nurse staffing has remained unchanged, and part-time registered nurse staffing has declined. This alarming trend threatens the quality of care patients receive, yet remains largely unaddressed.\r"

The magnitude of age bias is quantified and means to modify it are described. In particular, present value analysis (discounting) is demonstrated to markedly attenuate the effect of patient age on cost-effectiveness analysis. As the discount rate gets larger, the difference in potential \"life-years\" between old and young gets smaller and the age bias is minimized. However, relegating a decision about the importance of patient age to a decision about the discount rate seems inappropriate. Value judgments cannot be avoided; therefore, it is best that they be explicit.\r"

  ".W": "Since autoantibodies (Abs) to cytokines may modify their biologic activities, high-affinity binding factors for interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha BF) were characterized in human sera. IL-1 alpha BF was identified as IgG (1) by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation followed by immunodiffusion autoradiography, (2) by ligand-blotting method, (3) by ligand binding to affinity-immobilized serum IgG, and (4) by IgG affinity purification followed by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation. IL-1 alpha binding activity resided in the F(ab)2 fragment. The apparent equilibrium constant was in the range of IgG found after immunization with conventional antigens (i.e., 10(-9) to 10(-10) mol/L). Anti-IL-1 alpha IgG auto-Abs represented only an extremely small fraction of total IgG (less than 1/10(-5)). Some sera with IL-1 alpha BF and purified IgG thereof were able to inhibit by 96% to 98% the binding of human recombinant IL-1 alpha to its receptor on murine thymoma EL4-6.1 cells, whereas other sera did not. When 125I-labeled anti-IL-1 alpha IgG complexes were injected into rats, they prolonged the plasma half-life of 125I-labeled IL-1 alpha several fold and altered its tissue distribution. The predominant class was IgG (12/19), mainly IgG4 (9/19), but in five of the sera, anti-IL-1 alpha IgA was also detected. In a screening of 271 sera, IL-1 alpha BF was detected in 17/98 normal subjects and was not more frequent in several control groups of patients, except in patients with Schnitzler's syndrome (fever, chronic urticaria, bone pain, and monoclonal IgM paraprotein) (6/9; p less than 0.005). The pathologic significance of these auto-Abs remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the genetic origins of lupus auto-antibodies, we analyzed the relationship between VH gene usage and auto-Ag-binding properties of 352 B cell hybridomas derived from MRL-lpr/lpr mice. The hybridomas were derived from neonatal, 1-month-old, 3-month-old, and 6-month-old mice. The experimental strategy provided that the hybridomas were monoclonal at initial evaluation, so the Ag binding and V gene frequencies of the entire population could be determined. Initially, 1032 Ig-producing hybridomas were evaluated for binding to six Ag; VH gene family use was determined in 119 anti-DNA and anti-rabbit thymus extract (RTE) antibodies (autoantibodies) and in 233 age-matched Ig that did not bind to any of the six Ag (nonbinders). Neonatal B cells, including cross-reactive IgM autoantibodies and nonbinder IgM, used relatively 3' VH genes. The majority of B cells in adult mice used VH genes of the J558 family. Although J558 use was significantly higher among the autoantibodies (anti-DNA and anti-RTE) than among the nonbinder Ig, this difference was due to a higher frequency of J558 use by 1-month-old mice. At 3 months, J558 use by the nonbinder Ig increased to the same frequency of J558 use as in the autoantibody population. J558 use in both groups of antibodies exceeded a previously reported estimation of J558 expression in the functional B cell repertoire of young adult MRL-lpr/lpr mice. Several subgroups of antibodies that share properties with pathogenic Ig, including IgG, cross-reactive Ig, and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, demonstrated a marked preferential expression of the J558 family. These results suggest that there is an age-related bias in the activation of B cells using J558 VH genes in MRL-lpr/lpr mice that is under the influence of a selective force distinct from, or in addition to, an ssDNA or RTE auto-Ag-driven response.\r"

The other cytokines tested, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and IL-2, did not affect oligodendrocytes in culture over a 72-h observation period. None of the cytokines injured astrocytes cultured from the same source. LT showed a much more potent cytotoxicity than TNF toward oligodendrocytes; cytotoxic changes were noted earlier (24 h) and at lower units of activity. Morphologic studies showed that the LT-mediated effects were associated with early retraction of cell processes, depolymerization of F-actin and subsequent nuclear degeneration. Lack of early cytoplasmic membrane injury as measured by 51Cr release and electron microscope studies demonstrating nuclear disintegration suggested an apoptotic mechanism of oligodendrocyte injury evoked by LT, which was supported by DNA integrity assay. These results demonstrate that LT possesses potent cytotoxic activity against oligodendrocytes and that the major mechanism involved in this process is DNA fragmentation.\r"

  ".W": "This report examines the actions of IFN-gamma on monocytopoiesis in murine liquid and semisolid bone marrow cultures. The proliferative response of bone marrow cells to macrophage CSF and granulocyte-macrophage CSF was assayed by measuring [3H]TdR uptake in a range of mouse strains. No interstrain difference in kinetics was observed for CSF-1 action, but GM-CSF acted significantly more rapidly on C57B1/6, Swiss, and to a lesser extent A/J mice than on BALB/c or CBA. IFN-gamma inhibited [3H]TdR incorporation elicited by CSF-1, and to a much lesser extent, GM-CSF. When the two CSF were added together, the effects were not additive; in fact, the response was the same as that seen with GM-CSF alone. When IFN-gamma was also added, the response was restored to the level seen with CSF-1 alone. In essence, the inhibitory actions of GM-CSF and IFN-gamma were mutually exclusive. The mechanism of these actions was investigated using colony assays. As expected, CSF-1 caused the formation of pure macrophage colonies, whereas GM-CSF stimulated production of macrophage, granulocyte, and mixed granulocyte macrophage colonies. When the two CSF were added in combination, the total colony count was greater than with either alone, but less than additive. The number of pure macrophage colonies was reduced to the number seen with GM-CSF alone. IFN-gamma reduced the number of colonies in the presence of CSF-1, but slightly increased the number with GM-CSF. In the presence of both CSF, IFN-gamma increased the colony count by around 25 to 40%, so that the numbers were greater than the combined total of CSF-1 plus GM-CSF added separately. Similar results were obtained in all mouse strains tested. The results suggest that the thymidine uptake data reflect changes in the number of progenitor cells responding rather than changes in cell cycle time. The results are discussed in terms of the possibility that coadministration of GM-CSF and CSF-1 could ameliorate the myelosuppressive actions of IFN-gamma in vivo, leading to more effective use of this agent as a biologic response modifier.\r"

Removal of N-linked carbohydrate with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F revealed the core protein size of Mr 25,000. A rabbit antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide (CD2-300), composed of 18 amino acid residues of the conserved cytoplasmic domain of human, mouse, and rat CD2, precipitated an Ag similar to chicken CD2. Sequential precipitation with CD2-300 antiserum indicated the conservation of an avian and mammalian CD2 epitope. CD2 expression on thymocytes starts at day 11 of embryonic development, and, during subsequent development, thymic gamma delta cells are all CD2+, whereas most peripheral gamma delta-T cells lack CD2. Functional conservation between the chicken and mammalian CD2 molecules was demonstrated by the induction of DNA synthesis in chicken thymocytes and peripheral T cells with the combination of anti-CD2 mAb and PMA.\r"

We have purified a Rap1 protein that serves as a PKA substrate from human neutrophils, and we now identify this protein as Rap1A. A 23-kDa protein that co-migrated with recombinant Rap1A was phosphorylated in electroporated human neutrophils upon stimulation by cAMP in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP. This protein could be immunoprecipitated by the Rap1A/B-specific antibody, R61. The 23-kDa phosphoprotein was monitored during the purification of Rap1 from neutrophil membrane extracts and was shown to copurify with Rap1 during the DEAE Sephacel, heptylamine Sepharose, and MonoQ chromatography steps utilized. The purified protein was phosphorylated to an extent of 1 mol phosphate/mol GTP gamma S bound. This protein was identified as Rap1A by: 1) amino acid sequence analysis; and 2) immunoblotting with a Rap1A-specific antibody. The amino acid phosphorylated on Rap1A by PKA was a serine residue. The site of phosphorylation was indicated by carboxypeptidase digestion and confirmed using a mutant recombinant Rap1A lacking the relevant serine (serine-180). Rap1A, not Rap1B, appears to be the major 23-kDa PKA substrate in human neutrophils. It is possible that Rap1A plays a role in human neutrophils in mediating the inhibitory effects of cAMP-elevating agents upon chemoattractant-stimulated cell activation.\r"

Progressive infection has been linked to the failure of parasite-specific Th1, IFN-gamma-producing, CD4+ T lymphocytes to expand and direct macrophage activation and control of intracellular parasitism. In contrast, Th2 CD4+ cell expansion accompanies disease progression. Immunomodulation using CD4 cell depletion at the time of infection results in control of infection and Th1 CD4+ cell expansion. A Th1-like cell line, H1A, was established from the draining lymph nodes of an anti-CD4-pretreated BALB/c mouse infected with L. major, H1A was CD4, TCR(+)-alpha/beta, and released IL-2 and IFN-gamma in response to parasite Ag. A Th2-like cell line, U1A, was established from the lymph node cells of an infected BALB/c mouse that was also CD4, TCR(+)-alpha/beta but released IL-4 and IL-5 after stimulation. Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency were reconstituted with H1A and U1A before infection with L. major. Non-reconstituted mice were unable to restrict parasite growth. Mice reconstituted with H1A healed infection, whereas mice reconstituted with U1A suffered exacerbation of disease. Analysis of spleen cells by flow cytometry confirmed the reconstitution of CD4+ cells in both instances, and stimulation with mitogen established that the lymphokine profile of the donor cells had been maintained during 6 to 8 wk of infection. Histologic analysis of the lesions confirmed migration of donated cells to sites of infection. Neutralization of IFN-gamma in H1A-reconstituted mice and IL-4 in U1A-reconstituted mice reversed the disease phenotype mediated by the two cell lines. These data demonstrate the capacity of CD4+ T cells alone to modulate both positively and negatively the course of leishmaniasis in a lymphokine-dependent manner.\r"

Proliferative responses and IL-2 production induced by Con A in spleen cells from BALB/c mice were significantly depressed at an early stage after infection with E. multilocularis protoscoleces (PSC). Addition of plastic-adherent cells from normal syngeneic mice to the nonadherent spleen cells from infected mice did not restore the depressed Con A responsiveness. On the other hand, exogenous IL-2 reconstituted completely the proliferative responses to Con A. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that CD4- CD8+ cells with a low density of CD8 Ag (CD8dull cells) increased in spleens from infected mice 2 weeks after inoculation. Addition of the spleen cell subpopulation containing the CD8dull cells, but not that depleted of the CD8dull cells, to normal spleen cells resulted in marked suppression of the Con A responses. These findings suggest that the CD8dull cells detected in spleens of mice inoculated with E. multilocularis PSC may play a key role in the suppressive regulation of immune responses. The relevance of the immune suppression seen in the early stages of experimental infection with E. multilocularis PSC to the eventual establishment of a host-parasite relationship is discussed.\r"

To investigate the antibody response to a clinically relevant Ag, we have produced heterohybridomas secreting human antibodies directed against the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib PS). Immune lymphocytes were harvested 7 days after immunization with either of two vaccine formulations, a plain polysaccharide vaccine (Hib PS) or a polysaccharide-protein conjugate of Hib PS and diphtheria toxoid (Hib PS-D). H chain V region gene nucleic acid sequences were determined for five stable hybridomas. All use members of the VHIII gene family and are 83% to 98% homologous to two candidate germ-line sequences. A variety of D and JH segments are used. Thus the Ig H chain repertoire appears to be restricted to a limited group of VHIII family members. The previously reported expression of homologous sequences in the human fetal repertoire suggests that the inability of young children to respond to this Ag is not caused by deficiencies of these important elements early in development. The restricted use of VHIII gene segments suggests that this gene family plays a pivotal role in the immune response to this important childhood pathogen.\r"

A panel of 51 hybridoma antibodies that recognize two antigenic regions on the HA were compared for the sequence of their Ig H and L chain V regions. The hybridomas were obtained from 28 individual BALB/c mice that had been immunized with PR8 under a variety of primary and secondary response immunization protocols. The degree and pattern of sequence similarity suggests that 29 different VH genes drawn from seven different VH gene families, and 25 different Vk genes drawn from 12 different Vk gene families were used in this panel. Based on current estimates of the total numbers of VH and Vk genes in the mouse, this suggests that between 2.5 and 10% of the entire VH and Vk germ-line repertoires were used by these hybridomas. Despite this extensive diversity, some V genes were repetitively identified among these hybridomas, and were most often expressed in the context of specific VH/Vk combinations. Because antibodies that used identical VH/Vk combinations also usually displayed similar reactivity patterns with a panel of mutant viruses, this indicates that VH/Vk pairing can be important in establishing the specificity of antibodies for the HA.\r"

Previous studies of exons involved in the final glycoprotein structure have provided evidence of alternate exon use for only three exons (Ex-4, 5 and 6). However, our prior data using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) suggested the presence of at least one additional CD45 alternate exon. By using RT-PCR, Southern blotting with exon-specific or exon splice junction-specific oligonucleotide probes and direct DNA sequencing of RT-PCR products, we demonstrated additional alternate use involving Ex-7. PCR analysis of stage I thymocytes (CD4-CD8-) revealed only faintly detectable bands for two isoforms: one lacking Ex-4, 5, 6 and 7 (a \"minus-one\" [Ex(-1)] isoform), and a smaller isoform preliminarily characterized as also lacking Ex-8. Stage II thymocytes (CD4+CD8+) prominently expressed both Ex(-1) and zero alternate exon (Ex(0] isoforms, with one exon (Ex(1] and two exon (Ex(2] isoforms also present. Among stage III thymocytes, both CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ cells expressed only Ex(-1) and Ex(0) isoforms. CD45 alternate exon use in resting CD4+ and CD8+ lymph node T cells was divergent, with CD8+ cells additionally expressing an Ex(2) isoform. Among alloreactive T cell clones, band intensity for the Ex(1) isoform in CD4+ BC-3 cells was much less than for resting CD4+ T cells, while the CD8+ CTL clone 8.2.2 exhibited production of the higher alternate exon isoforms, Ex(2) and Ex(3). We conclude that at least four and possibly five alternate exons exist in the CD45 glycoprotein family, with a previously unrecognized isoform lacking Ex-4, 5, 6 and 7 prominently expressed in T cells. Shuffling of CD45 alternate exons appears to occur in an organized and predictable sequence during cellular maturation and activation.\r"

  ".W": "By examining a large database of amino acid sequences of antibodies of various specificities, we have found that many antibodies of distinctly different specificities assemble identical VL domains with different VH domains. In contrast, rarely is the same VH domain found in sets of antibodies of different specificities. We identified additional sets of antibodies of different specificities and identical sequences covering amino acid residues VH 1 to 94 and VL 1 to 95. In addition, there were segments of additional antibodies for which complete sequences were not available, but identities were seen in VL CDR1, VL CDR2, and VL CDR3 up to the VL-JL junction. The finding that there are many identical VL 1 to 95 segments with different VH 1 to 94 sequences, and vice versa, raises important questions as to the role of VH in influencing the conformation of VL and, conversely, the role of VL in influencing the conformation of VH. Evidence is also cited indicating that a single amino acid change may seriously disrupt site structure and in some instances abolish binding. Our findings suggest that it will be important in the future to investigate further conformational effects on antibody structure by using X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or other methods, to obtain a better understanding of the functions and topography of antibody-combining sites.\r"

Based on our preliminary observation of the tremendous variability of this region in the human system we have studied the potential of CDR3 regions for generating diversity in the human B cell repertoire. To this end we generated CDR3-specific cDNA libraries from tissues collected at several stages of human development. Detailed computer analysis of more than 500 sequences reveals that human CDR3 region have the potential to generate more than 10(14) different peptides. The mechanisms responsible for this diversity include rearrangement by inversion, D-D fusion, gene conversion and the frequent utilization of the recently described DIR genes. The specific recombination mechanisms which may explain aberrant rearrangements as well as differences between fetal and adult repertoires are discussed in detail.\r"

The operculum syndrome is a facio-pharyngo-glosso-masticatory diplegia usually due to structural lesions in both opercular regions. The reversibility of the syndrome in the reported case demonstrates that the operculum syndrome is sometimes functional rather than lesional.\r"

The temporal duration of this effect is unknown yet obviously important. We report serial bone scintigraphy in a patient who received a single dose of EHDP for hypercalcemia. Normal biodistribution of 99mTc-MDP was noted at 15 days, suggesting that 2 wk are sufficient before performing a bone scan after a single intravenous dose of etidronate.\r"

Intermediate filament (IF) preparations were obtained by extraction of the cerebral cortex with a high salt PBS solution containing 1% Triton X-100. The pellet contained the bulk of the cytoskeleton proteins from tissue, identified as the 150- and 68-kDa subunits of neurofilaments (NF-M and NF-L, respectively), the 66-kDa associated protein, the 57-kDa intermediate filament-like protein, and the 50-kDa glial fibrillary acidic protein. Intermediate filament-enriched fractions from control and malnourished rats at both d 21 and 90 were scanned following two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to determine the effects of postnatal malnutrition on the intermediate filament protein content. The results indicated that postnatal malnutrition imposed during the brain growth spurt period did not alter the expression of IF proteins of the cerebral cortex in 21-d-old rats, but increased the expression of NF-L and NF-M proteins in adult rats.\r"

Two experiments were conducted with weanling C57BL/6J mice. Animals were allowed ad libitum access for 14 d to a nutritionally complete purified diet (C), an isoenergetic low protein (0.6%) formulation (LP) or the low protein diet containing 0.2 microgram T3/g (LPT3). The LP diet produced wasting as judged by weight loss and carcass composition. This diet also depressed both the antibody response to sheep red blood cells (Experiment 1) and the complete major histocompatibility complex-disparate skin graft rejection response (Experiment 2). The LPT3-fed mice experienced wasting at least equivalent in magnitude to that of animals fed LP, but they exhibited significantly more vigorous responses than LP-fed animals in both immune reactions examined. In conjunction with previous results obtained using the CBA/J strain of mouse, the results show that not only humoral (antibody) responses but also at least some cell-mediated responses can be improved by T3 supplements in wasting PEM. Moreover, this influence on acquired immunity is apparent in at least two genetically unrelated mouse strains, thus increasing confidence in its basic biological significance.\r"

Uremic rats were given high energy (1385 kJ.kg body weight-1.day-1), low nitrogen (0.6 g N.kg body weight-1.day-1) total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 12 d with either glucose or glucose plus 30% lipids (Intralipid) as the energy source. Additional uremic and nonuremic groups were fed a standard diet orally. During TPN, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels were slightly higher in rats fed lipid-based TPN compared to those administered glucose-based TPN or fed the oral diet; but there were no differences 8 h after feeding. The serum lipoprotein fractions showed accumulation of lipids in LDL resulting from the lipid-based TPN but no differences in VLDL. In orally fed uremic rats, more lipids were found in HDL than in the TPN-treated rats. The fractional clearance of the fat emulsion was normal and independent of the nutrition composition. Uremic rats administered lipid-based TPN for 21 d had the same weight gain as orally fed, nonuremic control rats (23 +/- 3 vs. 22 +/- 2%); glucose-based TPN did not support normal growth (10 +/- 1%). Uremic rats fed orally did not grow and retained significantly more body water than TPN-fed uremic rats. In uremic animals, lipid-based TPN also was associated with normal body composition despite significantly lower levels of carnitine in plasma, skeletal muscle and heart tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Infants were fed either human milk (n = 21; 24 ng selenium/ml), preterm formula (n = 13; 7.8 ng selenium/ml), or preterm formula supplemented with sodium selenite (n = 12; 34.8 ng selenium/ml). Plasma and erythrocyte selenium and glutathione peroxidase activity and urinary and dietary selenium content were evaluated on study day 1 (day enteral feeds reached 100 kcal/kg/day) and weekly for 3 weeks. Throughout the study, selenium intakes of infants fed preterm formula plus sodium selenite were greater than those of infants fed human milk, which were greater than those of infants fed preterm formula (p less than 0.001). After 3 weeks no differences were observed among groups for plasma or erythrocyte selenium or glutathione peroxidase. Plasma selenium and glutathione peroxidase values within all groups were low compared with those reported for term infants fed human milk. Whereas urinary selenium levels of infants fed preterm formula plus sodium selenite were greater than those of infants fed preterm formula at weeks 1 and 2 (p less than 0.01), infants fed human milk and preterm formula had lower levels at week 3 than on study day 1 (p less than 0.05). We conclude that blood selenium measurements typically used to monitor selenium status do not reflect dietary selenium intakes of orally fed preterm infants.\r"

We found either severely reduced (63% of 68 neonates) or normal (similar to healthy adult) levels of NK activity. The percentages of cord blood mononuclear cells from the two groups of infants that expressed CD16, a differentiation antigen found in NK cells, were similar and within the range found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of adults. However, infants with low NK activity had reduced numbers of cells in the CD16+56+ subpopulation, whereas the number of these effector cells present in cord blood mononuclear cells from infants with normal NK activity was within the range found in adults. Recombinant interleukin-2, but not recombinant interferon-gamma, normalized the low NK activity of infants in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Analysis of the pattern of target cell susceptibility to lysis, together with the CD16+CD3- phenotype of the precursor and effector lymphocytes, demonstrated that the induced cytotoxicity was mediated by NK cells. In contrast, NK cells from infants with normal cytotoxic levels exhibited a functional response to interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma similar to that of adults. Our results indicate that NK cells in human neonates go through two different maturational stages.\r"

All patients underwent carotid duplex scanning and CT scanning before carotid arteriography. Two hundred thirty-seven patients (51%) had transient ischemic attacks, 109 (23%) had a prior stroke, and 122 (26%) were asymptomatic. Results of the CT scan were abnormal in 68 (62%) of the 109 patients with stroke. Fifty-one of the 360 patients (14%) without a clinical history of stroke had an abnormal CT scan outcome. Of patients with a stroke documented by CT scanning, 27 had lacunar infarcts, and 92 had cortical infarcts; these findings did not change surgical management in any patient. CT scanning did not reveal any unsuspected infarcts or tumors. Two hundred thirty carotid endarterectomies were performed on 206 patients. Forty-seven patients (23%) in the operative group had abnormal CT scan findings, but the scan did not influence operative decisions or timing in any case. Seventy-two patients (27%) in the nonoperative group had abnormal CT scan results, but CT scan findings did not exclude any patient from arteriography or surgery. Three perioperative strokes (1.3%) occurred. CT scan findings did not correlate with postoperative neurologic complications. Cost of CT scanning was one-half million dollars in our study alone. Routine CT scanning is unnecessary before carotid endarterectomy and is not cost-effective.\r"

  ".U": "91350828\r", 
  ".W": "The hypothesis tested is that shifts in pH, induced when a cardioplegic solution is oxygenated, can be detrimental. We added either 100% nitrogen, 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide, 100% oxygen, or 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide to the cardioplegic solution (St. Thomas' Hospital No. 2 plus glucose 11 mmol/L), and determined postischemic recovery of isolated rat hearts after 3 hours of 10 degrees C cardioplegic protected ischemia. Hearts were arrested and reinfused every 30 minutes throughout the ischemic period with cardioplegic solution. When 5% carbon dioxide was added to nitrogen, the pH of the cardioplegic solution decreased from 9.1 (100% nitrogen) to 7.0 (95% nitrogen: 5% carbon dioxide), a change associated with improved postischemic functional recovery. Aortic output improved from 52.3% +/- 2.7% to 63.9% +/- 2.8%, p less than 0.05, and cardiac output from 60.8% +/- 3.6% to 75.4% +/- 3.3%, p less than 0.01. This improvement was associated with diminished efflux of lactate during ischemia but increased postischemic release of lactate dehydrogenase. When nitrogen was replaced with oxygen, the addition of 5% carbon dioxide resulted in a similar decrease of pH, which again was associated with improved postischemic functional recovery. Aortic output improved from 66.3% +/- 2.8% (100% oxygen) to 88.9% +/- 3.7% (95% oxygen: 5% carbon dioxide), p less than 0.005, and cardiac output from 75.3% +/- 4.1% to 88.9% +/- 2.4%, p less than 0.01. The efflux of lactate during ischemia and the postischemic release of lactate dehydrogenase were similar in both groups. Furthermore, provision of additional oxygen with perfluorocarbons in an electrolyte solution identical to the St. Thomas' Hospital plus glucose solution and oxygenated with 95% oxygen: 5% carbon dioxide conferred no extra protection. In conclusion, the St. Thomas' Hospital No. 2 plus glucose cardioplegic solution should be oxygenated but with 95% oxygen: 5% carbon dioxide and not 100% oxygen because of the additive effect of a relatively \"acidotic\" pH.\r"

To evaluate the clinical performance of this monitor, we drew 220 arterial and 216 venous blood samples from 15 patients, and simultaneous blood gas values displayed by the monitor were compared with standard laboratory measurements. The continuous monitor predicted laboratory values with varying degrees of accuracy. (R2 values by linear regression: arterial oxygen tension 0.86, venous oxygen tension 0.36, arterial carbon dioxide tension 0.58, venous carbon dioxide tension 0.72, arterial pH 0.53, venous pH 0.58; pH 0.53, venous pH 0.58; p less than 0.0001). Monitor values of arterial oxygen tension overestimated laboratory values (bias = + 43.5 mm Hg), but the laboratory reference method likely underestimated true arterial oxygen tension in the high range achieved on bypass. Monitoring of venous oxygen tension was imprecise (precision = +/- 6.51 mmHg), regardless of whether stable conditions existed during the sampling period. Monitoring of carbon dioxide tension and pH showed small bias (carbon dioxide tension within 2 mm Hg, pH within 0.03) and good precision (carbon dioxide tension within 3 mm Hg, pH within 0.03). With the development of unstable conditions on bypass, monitor arterial oxygen tension values showed a changing relationship to corresponding laboratory values. In conclusion, arterial and venous carbon dioxide tension and pH monitoring provide acceptably accurate alternatives to laboratory measurement of these variables during cardiopulmonary bypass. Arterial oxygen tension monitoring accurately indicates changes in oxygen tension in the arterial oxygen tension range typically produced during extracorporeal circulation. Oxygen tension monitoring in the venous oxygen tension range is too imprecise for clinical decision-making purposes.\r"

  ".U": "91351285\r", 
  ".W": "Cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibit T- and B-cell activation and other processes essential to an effective immune response. In T lymphocytes these drugs disrupt an unknown step in the transmission of signals from the T-cell antigen receptor to cytokine genes that coordinate the immune response. The putative intracellular receptors for FK506 and cyclosporin are cis-trans prolyl isomerases. Binding of the drug inhibits isomerase activity, but studies with other prolyl isomerase inhibitors and analysis of cyclosporin-resistant mutants in yeast suggest that the effects of the drug result from the formation of an inhibitory complex between the drug and isomerase, and not from inhibition of isomerase activity. A transcription factor, NF-AT, which is essential for early T-cell gene activation, seems to be a specific target of cyclosporin A and FK506 action because transcription directed by this protein is blocked in T cells treated with these drugs, with little or no effect on other transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-kappa B. Here we demonstrate that NF-AT is formed when a signal from the antigen receptor induces a pre-existing cytoplasmic subunit to translocate to the nucleus and combine with a newly synthesized nuclear subunit of NF-AT. FK506 and cyclosporin A block translocation of the cytoplasmic component without affecting synthesis of the nuclear subunit.\r"

The virus encodes three late proteins, which are produced only in terminally differentiating keratinocytes, two of which are structural components of the virion. The third, E1-E4, is derived primarily from the E4 open reading frame, which represents a region of maximal divergence between different HPV types. E1-E4 does not seem to be a component of the virus particle or to be needed for transformation in vitro, but accumulates in the cytoplasm, where in certain benign lesions it can comprise 20-30% of total cell protein. We show here that expression of the HPV-16 E1-E4 protein in human keratinocytes (the natural host cell for HPV infection) results in the total collapse of the cytokeratin matrix. Tubulin and actin networks are unaffected by E1-E4, as are the nuclear lamins.\r"

By intranuclear injection of antisense oligonucleotides into rat pituitary GH3 cells, the essential role of the Go-type G proteins in Ca(2+)-channel inhibition is established: the subtypes Go1 and Go2 mediate inhibition through the muscarinic and somatostatin receptors, respectively.\r"

Surprisingly, CD4+8- thymocytes differ from their immediate progeny, naive peripheral CD4+ cells, in that they secrete a broader range of lymphokines, including interleukins 4, 5 and 10 and gamma-interferon, and more closely resemble immunologically experienced (activated or memory) CD4+ lymphocytes.\r"

This reflects the relatively brief lifespan of many newly generated B cells and argues for a well-regulated death mechanism. Even so, a secondary immune response can be generated years after a primary exposure to antigen. Antigen that might restimulate B cells persists for extended periods on follicular dendritic cells in the light zone of germinal centres. Antigen-binding B cells have also been found months after the end of obvious cell division. The precise signal that enables certain B cells to emerge as long-term surviving memory cells is unknown. Bcl-2, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, blocks programmed cell death in B cells. We report here that this proto-oncogene maintains immune responsiveness. Transgenic mice overproducing Bcl-2 have a long-term persistence of immunoglobulin-secreting cells and an extended lifetime for memory B cells.\r"

Our data would suggest that patients who exhibit less than 500 microvolts of ongoing EMG activity during surgery, and who yield at least a 500-microvolt contraction when stimulated with 0.05 milliamps at the brainstem after tumor removal, can expect an excellent immediate facial nerve result (grade I or II).\r"

Appropriate evaluation and management of the patient with signs and symptoms of orbital inflammation may prevent progression to blindness. Evaluation of patients with orbital inflammation from sinusitis includes a comprehensive clinical examination and radiographic studies. Clinical examination should test for changes in visual acuity, pupillary reactivity, and extraocular motion. Computerized tomography (CT) has facilitated the diagnosis of orbital infections and aids in diagnosis. However, CT can be misleading in patients with acute orbital infections and should not be relied on to determine the need for surgical intervention. We reviewed the records of all patients admitted to Parkland Memorial Hospital from 1978 to 1988 with orbital complications resulting from sinusitis. Four of 159 patients in this group had permanent blindness. The presence of an abscess, which was ultimately found at surgical exploration, was not diagnosed by CT in any of these four patients. Clinical examination remains the most important indicator for surgical intervention in patients with orbital complications of sinusitis. We present our findings and give guidelines for surgical intervention in patients with orbital infections resulting from sinusitis.\r"

Significant differences were found between perilymph and these fluids. Free amino acid analysis was then used to quantitatively analyze middle ear microaspirates in order to test the hypothesis that perilymph is a potential source of clear fluid in perilymphatic fistulas (PLF). Fourteen unknown samples from patients with visually identified PLF, including patients with no identifiable otic capsule defect, were studied. Six samples on amino acid pattern analysis were correlated most similarly with perilymph (rrho greater than 0.95). Four of these six samples were scored on the basis of quantitative amino acid values as similar to perilymph. However, three samples of clear fluid were more similar to serum/plasma than to perilymph on both amino acid pattern and quantitative amino acid score analysis. These results objectively suggest perilymph as a potential source of clear fluid in some patients with a diagnosis of PLF. Not all clear fluid observed in the middle ear, however, is potentially perilymph.\r"

Although the Kambic-Sedlacek-Tucker (K-S-T) technique of glottic reconstruction offers early extubation with an adequate airway, a subsequent wide neoglottis may increase the chance of aspiration and a poor voice. To better restore the laryngeal functions of closure and phonation, we made some modifications on the original K-S-T technique as follows: (1) One of the lateral margins of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic fold is sutured to the arytenoid region of the cricoid rather than a thyroid cartilage remnant. A neo-arytenoid is formed. (2) The other lateral margin of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic fold is sutured to the cut edge of the false and true cord instead of a thyroid ala remnant. Therefore both margins of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic folds are lowered as much as possible to the level of the glottis. A new pseudocord is formed. (3) A cartilage cut is made at the anterior aspect of the epiglottis, leaving its laryngeal surface of mucoperichondrial intact. A new anterior commissure with a sharp angle is shaped by this maneuver. Nineteen hemilaryngectomies with modified epiglottic laryngoplasty have been performed by members of the Department of Otolaryngology of Guangxi Medical College since 1984. Results in this series are fairly good and indicate that the modified epiglottic laryngoplasty is effective in enhancing functional results in terms of respiration, deglutition, and phonation.\r"

Function was assessed immediately postoperatively, at time of discharge, and at 1 year postoperatively using the House six-point scale. Results were grouped as satisfactory, intermediate, or poor and were analyzed by tumor size. Facial nerve results were better at all time intervals in the monitored groups, although the difference was not statistically significant at the 1-year interval. There was no difference between monitored and unmonitored patients in the subgroups with tumors smaller than 2.5 cm in diameter. This study supports the usefulness of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring in improving facial nerve results, particularly in larger tumors.\r"

The procedure is not an option in patients with bilateral facial paralysis or those at risk for combined cranial nerve deficits. To address some of the drawbacks and limitations of this classic procedure, we developed the hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional jump graft (12-7 jump graft) procedure. This procedure involves interposing a nerve graft between a partially severed but functionally intact twelfth cranial nerve and the degenerated seventh cranial nerve, and is often combined with other reanimation procedures. To date, we have performed 33 12-7 jump graft procedures in 30 patients (three were treated for bilateral facial paralysis); this report describes the procedure and its indications, and details the results of 23 procedures performed in 20 patients for whom 24-month follow-up data are available. Twelfth nerve deficits occurred in only three patients in this report. Recovery of facial function began between 3 and 24 months postoperatively. Facial tone and symmetry were achieved in every patient, no patient had significant mass movement, and 13 patients (two of whom were treated for bilateral facial paralysis) had excellent and three had superb restoration of facial movement. These results show the 12-7 jump graft to be a valuable adjunct for facial reanimation in selected patients.\r"

We investigated the presence of facial nerve stimulation associated with cochlear implants in the VA Cooperative Study of Advanced Cochlear implants. Twelve of 82 patients enrolled in this study demonstrated facial nerve stimulation within 2 years of implant activation. Facial nerve stimulation in six patients with multiple channel implants (Nucleus or ineraid devices) either resolved spontaneously (n = 2), or was eliminated by deactivating basal (n = 2) or apical (n = 2) electrodes. Two of six patients with single-channel electrodes (3-M/Vienna devices) demonstrated facial nerve stimulation that resolved spontaneously (n = 2), resolved with lowering current output (n = 2), or was refractory to processor adjustment (n = 2). Intraoperative assessment in one of the refractory cases indicated that facial nerve stimulation resulted from current spread through the modiolus to activate the facial nerve. A variety of factors, including implant design, stimulus parameters, and local tissue impedances, may interact to produce incidental facial stimulation. Low-impedance pathways between the scala tympani and the modiolus may deserve increased recognition as an interactive factor in cochlear implant performance.\r"

Patients experienced an overall 5-year cure rate of 98% after surgical or radiation salvage of unsuccessful laser cordectomies. Six patients had preoperative and postoperative videostrobolaryngoscopy. The most common postoperative problem with voice was a breathiness that did not resolve in any of the patients. All patients had absent or moderately reduced amplitude and mucosal wave patterns and imcomplete glottic closure proportional to the amount of cordal tissue removed. Despite it seemingly poor results in carefully selected patients, laser cordectomy is still indicated without compromising the ultimate oncologic results. Advantages over radiation therapy or conservation laryngeal surgery include a short treatment time, requiring only an outpatient surgical procedure at the time of the initial diagnostic and/or staging laryngoscopy, and the avoidance of potential radiation side effects or surgical complications. However, patients should be advised the possibility of persistent postoperative breathy dysphonia, in addition to the possibility of further treatment to effect a long-term cure.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1983, we have treated advanced (UICC stages III and IV) squamous carcinomas of the larynx by primary radiotherapy, using three small fractions a day, 3-4 h interfraction interval, 5 days per week. The early patients received doses per fraction of 1.5 Gy, and a total dose of approximately 70 Gy, given as a split-course over 6 to 7 weeks. While overall tumor control and laryngeal preservation was good, a number of severe late radiation reactions were seen. The schedule was then modified, with a reduction in the fraction size to 1.1 Gy, the total dose to 60 Gy, and the overall time to 4 weeks, with omission of the mid-treatment \"split.\" Since 1986, we have treated 26 patients in this way. Acute reactions are brisk, but rapidly healing. Loco-regional control was achieved in 22 patients, only one of whom has relapsed to date, in a solitary node, salvaged by radical neck dissection. Four have died of uncontrolled loco-regional malignancy, and three of intercurrent disease while in clinical remission. No serious late morbidity has been observed in surviving patients, and vocal quality is good in the majority. These results suggest that this hyperfractionated and accelerated radiotherapy schedule may offer an acceptable nonsurgical, voice-preserving treatment for advanced laryngeal carcinoma; it can be used in a normally working radiotherapy department.\r"

A set of microlaryngeal instruments with an elongated shaft has been developed to support the use of the subglottiscope in the adult patient population. During the 18-month period from January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1989, sixteen adult patients with subglottic or upper cervical tracheal pathology were operated on a total of twenty-three times, using the adult subglottiscope to facilitate exposure and treatment. The patients' pathologic conditions included subglottic stenosis, subglottic granuloma, subglottic extension of laryngeal hemangioma and papilloma, and suprastomal granuloma. Two selected cases are presented to highlight indications for the use of this instrument. We have found the exposure of these subglottic and upper cervical tracheal lesions, using the binocular, microlaryngeal approach facilitated by the adult subglottiscope, to be improved over that obtained with existing microlaryngoscopes or conventional tracheoscopes.\r"

  ".W": "Otolaryngologists are being asked with increasing frequency to assess adequacy of the upper airway and to treat upper airway obstructive problems in orthodontic patients. The incentive has been provided by recent studies that purport to relate upper airway obstruction to dental and craniomorphologic changes. It is hypothesized that prolonged oral respiration during critical growth periods in children initiates a sequence of events that commonly results in dental and skeletal changes. In the chronic mouth-breather excessive molar tooth eruption is almost a constant feature, causing a clockwise rotation of the growing mandible, with a disproportional increase in anterior lower vertical face height. Such increases in anterior lower vertical face height are often associated with retrognathia and open bites. Low tongue posture seen with oral respiration impedes the lateral expansion and anterior development of the maxilla. Otolaryngologists have the ability to objectively and accurately assess upper airway patency. Rhinometric assessment before and after application of topical nasal decongestant, in conjunction with clinical examination, provides valuable information regarding upper airway patency and the cause of any existing obstructive pathologic condition. Studies should be designed carefully to control the numerous variables that have an impact on the growing face of a young child so that meaningful data can be obtained in our own field regarding this challenging topic.\r"

The second channel tested, formed from a polysaccharide called chitosan, was prepared with NGF and laminin in the channel walls and provided a sustained release of NGF. At six weeks post-implantation, no improvement in nerve regeneration was identified in those channels prepared with NGF when comparing electromyographic thresholds (microA), maximum potentials (mV), nerve diameter, myelin sheath thickness, myelinated axon counts, or diameter. However, increased angiogenesis was demonstrated within the chitosan and Silastic channels prepared with NGF compared to those channels without NGF. Silastic exhibited minimal inflammation.

  ".W": "Effective treatment of head and neck cancer with biologic response modifiers may be benefitted by an understanding of in vivo factors capable of modulating the lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell phenomenon. Eighteen patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were studied. Killer cells from each patient, activated by recombinant interleukin-2 (10 U/ml), were induced in either complete medium alone or complete medium plus 10% autologous serum solution and analyzed. Cytotoxicity against both K562 and squamous cell carcinoma (MDA686-Ln) cell lines was determined by use of standard chromium-release assays. The immunomodulatory capacity of serum was correlated with levels of various acute phase proteins. Autologous serum significantly inhibited the induction phase of the LAK phenomenon in 61% of patients and stimulated it in 22%. No patients with early stage I or II disease had significant inhibition of induction. No direct correlation between inhibition and serum acute phase protein levels were seen. An inverse relationship was seen between the C3 component of complement and induction inhibition (r = -0.6). These findings suggest that advances of in vivo immunomodulatory therapy will require elucidation of mechanisms of serologic inhibition of the induction phase of the LAK phenomenon. Such studies may lead to serologic modification to enhance treatment efficacy of biologic response modifiers.\r"

Traditionally, absent or decreased caloric response has been regarded as evidence of unilateral vestibular deficit. But, the inability of the chair test to detect side of lesion has been generally accepted because rotation stimulates both end organs. A retrospective study postulated and tested a hypothesis that low-frequency asymmetry of sinusoidal harmonic acceleration (SHA) testing can determine side of lesion when phase is abnormal. The present prospective, double-blind study was designed to further test the retrospective study hypothesis. Results showed that SHA asymmetry detects side of unilateral vestibular deficit when phase is abnormal in 97% of cases.\r"

Of surgeons sampled, 93% estimated incidence of PLF surgery to be less than or equal to 1 per 1000 otolaryngologic outpatient visits. The most reliable diagnostic indicators were history, symptomatology, and tympanometric and electronystagmographic fistula tests. About 72% of surgeons reported less than 4 weeks' average delay before surgery. Most surgeons and patients (greater than or equal to 70%) rated length of disability before return to work, exposure to noise, travel by airplane, swimming, and heavy lifting, at several weeks to several months. Diving was the most restricted activity. Results suggest that incidence of surgery and disability with PFL in the United States is very limited.\r"

The accuracy of staging EAM carcinoma with preoperative CT scans was evaluated by comparing radiography and histopathology. Patients who received preoperative CT scan were selected from a retrospective series of 35 temporal bone resections for EAM squamous cell carcinoma. The CT scans were systematically reviewed for tumor involvement in 12 anatomic areas. The histopathology slides for the corresponding patients were reviewed according to the same criteria. CT scan findings accurately diagnosed the extent of tumor involvement identified during histopathologic examination. These tumors demonstrated the capacity to spread along existing anatomic pathways as well as direct bone erosion. We conclude that preoperative CT scans accurately stage EAM squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

Eighty consecutive patients were treated in one of two studies investigating three or four courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Before local therapy and surgery and/or radiotherapy, 29% attained a complete remission. No strong significant and independent predictor of complete remission was identified. Only nodal stage (N) was found moderately associated with complete remission (p = 0.06). Node-negative patients had higher remission rates. Less important predictors were tumor stage (T) and site of disease; nasopharyngeal patients had superior remission rates (56%). With a median followup of 45 months and estimated 3-year survival rate of 38% (median 23.7 months), individual factors predictive of survival included pretherapy weight loss, performance status, alcohol use, pretherapy serum albumin level, site of disease, and N stage. In multivariate testing weight loss was identified as the strongest independent predictor of survival (p less than 0.0001) and surpassed other health status measures, such as performance status and serum albumin level. In addition, N stage (p = 0.019) and alcohol use (p = 0.017) were found to be predictive. A cross-classification by N stage and weight loss revealed risk groups with distinctly different prognoses, which may be useful for design and analysis in future trials.\r"

Otologic symptoms were infrequent, occurring only with temporal bone involvement. In true vagal paragangliomas, cranial nerve and auditory function is usually preserved until there is extensive disease of the skull base. Tumor progression after radiotherapy was documented in four patients, three of whom were treated with 4500 cGy or more. One patient was found to have regional lymph node metastases. The six patients had a total of 10 head and neck paragangliomas, illustrating the high incidence of synchronous and metachronous lesions. Because of the high incidence of multiple lesions, these tumors threaten lower cranial nerves bilaterally in many instances. Because cranial nerve function is preserved until late, and because vagal and accessory nerve paralysis is usually unavoidable with resection, we advocate conservative treatment in selected cases. It may be reasonable to postpone surgery until cranial nerve impairment becomes evident or other vital structures are threatened.\r"

However, the medical literature concerning this topic over the last two decades has consisted mainly of case reports. We reviewed eight cases of retropharyngeal space infection at our institutions over a 15-year period, representing one of the largest clinical series of its kind in the last 20 years. Patient ages ranged from 3 months to 41 years. Findings of these cases and 13 cases from similar reports obtained by a MEDLINE computer search of the recent literature were analyzed. Results show a trend toward occurrence in older age groups, polymicrobial infections, successful use of CT scan as a diagnostic modality, and fewer patients requiring incision and drainage. These findings will be discussed and contrasted to conventional wisdom.\r"

Birth weight of the cocaine-exposed neonates was significantly lower than that of the control group. Gestational age, length, and head circumference of the cocaine-exposed neonates were also lower, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. Between 24 and 48 hours of age, circulating concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine, and the catecholamine precursor dihydroxyphenylalanine were measured and behavior was assessed using the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. Mean dihydroxyphenylalanine concentrations were increased in the cocaine-exposed newborns (10.3 ng/mL vs 5.9 ng/mL, P = .055), while there was no difference between the groups in mean norepinephrine or dopamine concentrations. There was a significant negative correlation between norepinephrine concentration and orientation cluster score for the cocaine-exposed newborns (r2 = .6979, P = .005). norepinephrine concentration did not correlate with the score for any other behavioral cluster, nor did dopamine or dihydroxyphenylalanine concentration correlate with the score for any cluster. These preliminary data from a pilot study suggest that catecholamine activity is increased in cocaine-exposed newborns and may play a role in neurobehavioral disturbances associated with prenatal exposure to this drug.\r"

  ".W": "Senile plaques are polymorphous beta-amyloid protein deposits found in the brain in Alzheimer disease and normal aging. This beta-amyloid protein is derived from a larger precursor molecule of which neurons are the principal producers in brain. We found that amyloid precursor protein (APP)-immunoreactive neurites were involved in senile plaques and that only a subset of these neurites showed markers for the abnormal filaments characteristic of neurofibrillary pathology. In the neocortex of nondemented individuals with senile plaques but spared of neurofibrillary pathology, dystrophic neurites in senile plaques showed only APP accumulation. In contrast, in the brains of Alzheimer patients, virtually all APP-immunoreactive neurites also showed immunoreactivity with ubiquitin, tau, and phosphorylated neurofilaments. The presence of tau and neurofilament epitopes in dystrophic neurites in senile plaques was correlated with the extent of neurofibrillary pathology in the surrounding brain tissue. Accumulation of APP and the formation of neurofibrillary pathology in senile plaque neurites are therefore distinct phenomena. Our findings suggest that APP accumulation in senile plaque neurites occurs prior to tau accumulation and is therefore more closely related to appearance of neuritic dystrophy.\r"

  ".U": "91352034\r", 
  ".W": "A significant role for mouse chromosome 7 abnormalities during chemically induced skin carcinogenesis has been advanced based on previous cytogenetic and molecular studies. To determine the frequency of allelic losses at different loci of chromosome 7 in skin tumors induced in the outbred SENCAR mouse stock by a two-stage initiation-promotion protocol, we compared the constitutional and tumor genotypes of premalignant papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas for loss of heterozygosity at different informative loci. In a previous study, these tumors had been analyzed for their allelic composition at the Harvey ras-1 (Ha-ras-1) locus and it was found that 39% of squamous cell carcinomas had lost the normal Ha-ras-1 allele exhibiting 3 or 2 copies of the mutated counterpart or gene amplification. In the present study, by combining Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction fragment length polymorphism analyses, we detected complete loss of heterozygosity at the beta-globin (Hbb) locus, distal to Ha-ras-1, in 15 of 20 (75%) skin carcinomas. In addition, 5 of 5 informative cases attained homozygosity at the int-2 locus, 27 centimorgans distal to Hbb. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA extracted from papillomas devoid of stromal contamination by fluorescence-activated sorting of single cell dispersions immunolabeled with anti-keratin 13 antibody revealed loss of heterozygosity at the Hbb locus, demonstrating that this event occurs during premalignant stages of tumor development. Interestingly, loss of heterozygosity was only detected in late-stage lesions exhibiting a high degree of dysplasia and areas of microinvasion. Analysis of allelic ratios by densitometric scanning of tumors that had become homozygous at Hbb but retained heterozygosis at Ha-ras-1 indicated mitotic recombination as the mechanism underlying loss of heterozygosity on mouse chromosome 7 during chemically induced skin carcinogenesis. These findings are consistent with the presence of a putative tumor suppressor gene linked to the Hbb locus in the 7F1-ter region of mouse chromosome 7, the functional inactivation of which may constitute a critical event in skin tumor progression, possibly during the malignant conversion stage.\r"

  ".W": "The aberrant overexpression of interleukin 6 (IL-6) is implicated as an autocrine mechanism in the enhanced proliferation of the neoplastic cell elements in various B- and T-cell malignancies and in some carcinomas and sarcomas; many of these neoplasms have been shown to be associated with a mutated p53 gene. The possibility that wild-type (wt) p53, a nuclear tumor-suppressor protein, but not its transforming mutants might serve to repress IL-6 gene expression was investigated in HeLa cells. We transiently cotransfected these cells with constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/promoter expression plasmids overproducing wt or mutant human or murine p53 and with appropriate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmids containing the promoter elements of human IL-6, c-fos, or beta-actin genes or of porcine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene in pN-38 to evaluate the effect of the various p53 species on these promoters. Murine and human wt p53 derived from pCMVNc9 and pC53-SN3, respectively, strongly repressed the IL-6 (promoter position -225 to +13), c-fos (-711 to +42), beta-actin (-3400 to +912), and MHC (-528 to -38) promoters in serum-induced HeLa cells; additionally, IL-6 promoter/CAT transcription unit constructs induced by IL-1, phorbol ester, or pseudorabies virus were also repressed by wt human and murine p53. The murine transforming mutant p53 (pCMVc5) was less active in repressing the IL-6, c-fos, beta-actin, and MHC promoter constructs. The human p53 mutant derived from pC53-SCX3 was also less active than the wt protein in repressing the IL-6, c-fos, beta-actin, and MHC promoters, except that serum-induced IL-6/CAT expression was equally repressed by both human wt and mutant p53. In similar transient transfection experiments in HeLa cells, overexpression of the wt human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, RB, was found to repress the serum-induced IL-6 (-225 to +13), c-fos (-711 to +42), and beta-actin (-3400 to +912) promoters but not the PRV-induced IL-6 (-110 to +13) or the serum-induced MHC (-528 to -38) promoters. These observations identify transcriptional repression as a property of p53 and suggest that p53 and RB may be involved as transcriptional repressors in modulating IL-6 gene expression during cellular differentiation and oncogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The mammalian prion protein (PrPC) is a cellular protein of unknown function, an altered isoform of which (PrPSc) is a component of the infectious particle (prion) thought to be responsible for spongiform encephalopathies in humans and animals. We report here the isolation of a cDNA that encodes a chicken protein that is homologous to PrPC. This chicken prion-like protein (ch-PrLP) is identical to the mouse PrP at 33% of its amino acid positions, including an uninterrupted stretch of 24 identical residues, and it displays the same structural domains. In addition, ch-PrLP, like its mammalian counterpart, is attached to the cell surface by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. We find that ch-PrLP is the major protein in preparations of an acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity that has been purified greater than 10(6)-fold from brain on the basis of its ability to stimulate synthesis of nicotinic receptors by cultured myotubes. The ch-PrLP gene is expressed in the spinal cord and brain as early as embryonic day 6; and in the spinal cord, the protein appears to be concentrated in motor neurons. Our results therefore raise the possibility that prion proteins serve normally to regulate the chemoreceptor number at the neuromuscular junction and perhaps in the central nervous system as well.\r"

  ".W": "Unlike mammals, chickens generate an immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire by a developmentally regulated process of intrachromosomal gene conversion, which results in nucleotide substitutions throughout the variable regions of the Ig heavy- and light-chain genes. In contrast to chicken Ig genes, we show in this report that diversity of the rearranged chicken T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain gene is generated by junctional heterogeneity, as observed in rearranged mammalian TCR genes. This junctional diversity increases during chicken development as a result of an increasing base-pair addition at the V beta-D beta and D beta-J beta joints (where V, D, and J are the variable, diversity, and joining gene segments). Despite the junctional hypervariability, however, almost all functional V beta-D beta-J beta junctions appear to encode a glycine-containing beta-turn. Such a turn may serve to position the amino acid side chains of a hypervariable TCR beta-chain loop with respect to the antigen-binding groove of the major histocompatibility complex molecule. Consistent with this hypothesis, the germ-line D beta nucleotide sequences of chickens, mice, rabbits, and humans have been highly conserved and encode a glycine in all three reading frames.\r"

  ".U": "91352057\r", 
  ".W": "The leukocyte common antigen (CD45) is an abundant lymphocyte surface antigen that has been reported to be involved in signaling through the T-cell antigen receptor. CD45 is a transmembrane protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. An internal segment comprises two domains each of which is homologous to other protein-tyrosine-phosphatases; the extracellular segment has the hallmarks of a ligand-binding motif. Since tyrosine phosphorylation is an early signal resulting from stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor and CD45 is required for proper activation through the receptor, we explored whether CD45 might be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Treatment of a T-cell leukemia line (Jurkat) with either phytohemagglutinin or anti-CD3 antibodies induced phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD45; treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not. Phosphorylation of CD45 was transient, disappearing within 40 min after phytohemagglutinin treatment. The requirement for stringent conditions of phosphatase inhibition suggests that CD45 is capable of autodephosphorylation in vivo. These observations support recent reports indicating CD45 is involved in an early step in the T-cell activation cascade. They also suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD45 should be explored further as a possible regulatory mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "91352065\r", 
  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene expression is regulated by both general transcription factors and factors induced by activation of T lymphocytes such as NF-kappa B and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Within the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR), two purine-rich domains between nucleotides -283 and -195 have homology to a regulatory region found in the interleukin 2 promoter, which binds NFAT and other cellular factors. In the HIV LTR, this region has been demonstrated to have both positive and negative regulatory effects on HIV gene expression. In an attempt to clone genes encoding cellular factors that bind to these NFAT-like elements in the HIV LTR, we used lambda gt11 expression cloning with oligonucleotides corresponding to these binding motifs. A ubiquitously expressed cDNA encoding a 60-kDa protein, which we termed interleukin binding factor (ILF), binds specifically to these purine-rich motifs in the HIV LTR. This factor also binds to similar purine-rich motifs in the interleukin 2 promoter, through with lower affinity than to HIV LTR sequences. Sequence analysis reveals that the DNA binding domain of ILF has strong homology to the recently described fork head DNA binding domain found in the Drosophila homeotic protein fork head and a family of hepatocyte nuclear factors, HNF-3. Other domains found in ILF include a nucleotide binding site, an N-glycosylation motif, a signal for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and a potential nuclear localization signal. These results describe a DNA binding protein that may be involved in both positive and negative regulation of important viral and cellular promoter elements.\r"

The u-PA is secreted and normally maintained in the inactive, single-chain form (scu-PA) and it has been assumed that natural activation occurs via a plasmin-mediated cleavage converting scu-PA to the active, two-chain form (tcu-PA). We now demonstrate that secreted scu-PA in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblast (RSVCEF) cultures is activated by an endogenous, plasmin-independent mechanism. Normal CEFs and CEFs infected with a temperature-sensitive RSV mutant and incubated at the nonpermissive temperature do not activate scu-PA. Conditioned medium harvested from plasmin-free cultures of RSVCEFs contains active tcu-PA as determined by two independent methods. The scu-PA is progressively converted with time in culture and requires the presence of intact cells or a plasma membrane-enriched fraction. When added to RSVCEF cultures, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 20-41 of the growth factor domain of chicken u-PA blocks the conversion to tcu-PA, and scu-PA accumulates in the cultures. These results suggest that scu-PA is secreted by cells, becomes bound to a u-PA receptor, and is proteolytically converted to active tcu-PA by a catalytic mechanism on the surface of RSV-transformed fibroblasts.\r"

SDS/PAGE of the purified NO synthase gave three closely spaced silver-staining protein bands between 125 and 135 kDa. When assayed in the presence of L-arginine, NADPH, tetrahydrobiopterin, FAD, and reduced thiol, purified NO synthase had a specific activity of 1313 nmol of NO2- plus NO3- per min per mg. The apparent Km of the enzyme for L-arginine and NADPH was 2.8 and 0.3 microM, respectively. Addition of calcium ions with or without calmodulin did not increase the activity of the purified enzyme, and NO synthesis was not altered by calmodulin inhibitors. Gel filtration chromatography indicated that the induced NO synthase was catalytically competent as a dimer of approximately 250 kDa but could be dissociated into inactive monomers of approximately 130 kDa in the absence of L-arginine, FAD, and tetrahydrobiopterin. Upon heat denaturation, NO synthase released 1.1 mol of FAD and 0.55 mol of FMN per mol of 130-kDa subunit. Thus, inducible macrophage NO synthase differs in several respects from constitutive NO synthases and is one of very few eukaryotic enzymes containing both FAD and FMN.\r"

Alterations in the sequence of the TfR mRNA regulatory region have been identified that render the mRNA unregulated by iron and intrinsically unstable. When cells expressing this unstable mRNA are treated with inhibitors of protein synthesis (cycloheximide or puromycin), the steady-state level of the encoded human TfR mRNA is increased due to a stabilization of the transcript. A similar set of observations has been made using a chimeric mRNA in which the rapid turnover determinant of the TfR mRNA is replaced by the (A+U)-rich region from the 3' untranslated region of c-fos mRNA. To distinguish between a labile protein participant in the degradation of these mRNAs and a requirement for their translation per se, we introduced a ferritin iron-responsive element into the 5' untranslated region of each of these mRNAs. The presence of the 5' iron-responsive element allowed us to use iron availability to alter the translation of the mRNAs in question without global effects on cellular protein synthesis. Although specific translation of these mRNAs could be inhibited by iron chelation to a degree comparable to that seen with cycloheximide (approximately 95% inhibition), no effects on mRNA turnover were observed. These data support a model in which a trans-acting labile protein is necessary for the turnover of these mRNAs rather than there being a requirement for the translation of the mRNAs themselves.\r"

Three of the five heavy chain variable regions derive from the VHIV gene family, but each has arisen from a different heavy chain variable region (VH) gene segment within the VHIV family. In addition, one is derived from a VHI gene segment, and one is derived from a VHV gene segment. Since four of the five antibodies arise from known germ-line VH elements, a precise determination of the extent of somatic variation is possible. The amount of variation from the closest germ-line sequence ranges from 4.5% to 14.8% among these antibodies, most of which is concentrated in the complementarity-determining regions. In general, the diversity (D) segments are long, characteristic of D-D fusions and/or extensive terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase activity; however, definitive homologies cannot be found with the known germ-line D segments. Joining (JH) gene segment utilization appears random. The use of five different germ-line VH gene segments and extensive somatic mutation provides evidence that a polyclonal, antigen-driven immune response occurs during the natural infection with human immunodeficiency virus.\r"

The currently accepted explanation for these observations is that the envelope glycoproteins from primary clinical isolates possess lower affinities for CD4 than laboratory strains. This observation has far reaching implications for the clinical effectiveness of sCD4. To test whether the resistance of clinical isolates to sCD4 neutralization correlates with low-affinity binding to gp120, we have compared gp120 glycoproteins derived from the clinical isolates HIV-1 JR-CSF and JR-FL with those derived from the prototypic strain HIV-1 BH10 in quantitative sCD4 binding studies. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that gp120 derived from HIV-1 JR-CSF and JR-FL possess sCD4 binding affinities of equal or greater magnitude than gp120 derived from HIV-1 BH10. Thus primary clinical HIV-1 isolates can and do possess gp120 with high affinity for CD4, and sensitivity to neutralization by sCD4 is dependent upon factors other than the intrinsic affinity of gp120 for CD4.\r"

Systematic evaluation of the structural requirements of these inducers has led to a model detailing the role of the phenolics in induction. With this model, a specific inhibitor of vir induction has been developed. This inhibitor does not affect the induction of other genes on the Ti plasmid but irreversibly blocks vir expression.

  ".U": "91352095\r", 
  ".W": "Natriuretic peptides are structurally related hormones that regulate hemodynamics of the physiological processes of diuresis, water balance, and blood pressure. One of the second messengers of these hormones is cGMP, and the type of receptor that is involved in the generation of cGMP is also a guanylate cyclase. Recent genetic evidence has revealed such a receptor family; two family members, GC-A and GC-B, have been cloned. We now describe the molecular cloning, sequencing, and expression of a cDNA clone from rat adrenal gland that encodes a membrane guanylate cyclase, GC alpha, that, with the exception of two amino acids, is structurally identical to GC-A and conforms to the purported topographical model of GC-A. The two amino acid changes are the substitutions Gln338----His338 and Leu364----Pro364, involving single nucleotide changes, CAG----CAC and CTG----CCG, respectively. Expression studies indicate that GC alpha cyclase activity is independent of the known natriuretic peptides, and direct binding studies demonstrate that GC alpha is not an ANF receptor. To determine the importance of Gln338 and Leu364 in ANF signaling, the GC alpha cDNA regions encoding amino acid residues 338 and 364 were remodeled by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. A double mutant encoding Gln338 and Leu364, and a single-substitution mutant encoding Leu364 expressed both ANF binding and ANF-dependent cyclase activities, but the mutant encoding Gln338 and a deletion mutant lacking residue 364 did not express either of the above activities. These results define the critical role of Leu364 in ANF signal transduction.\r"

Of 43 patients originally recruited, 39 (19 men, 20 women) with typical clinical and laboratory features of alcoholic hepatitis (11 Child's-Pugh class B; 28 class C) were admitted to a metabolic unit and completed a 35-day three-phase protocol. Phase I was a 10-day baseline period of observation, during which routine and special quantitative tests of liver function (galactose and antipyrine metabolism), a 7-day elemental balance study, and a 15N, 13C-leucine metabolism study were done. Phase II was a 21-day treatment period during which patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four regimens: 1) standard therapy, consisting of abstinence, a balanced, nutritionally adequate diet, and multivitamins; 2) oxandrolone (20 mg orally four times a day) plus standard therapy; 3) nutritional supplementation, consisting of 2 L daily of 3.5% crystalline amino acids (in 5% dextrose), given by peripheral vein; or 4) a combination of oxandrolone and nutritional supplementation, along with standard therapy. Metabolic balances were repeated during phase II. Phase III was 2 or 3 days posttreatment, during which special studies of liver functions and volumes and leucine metabolism were repeated. All patients who completed phase I of study and were randomly allocated to one of the four treatment groups completed the subsequent two phases. Overall, with time, patients showed highly significant improvements in most clinical and laboratory features. For most standard laboratory tests (e.g., serum albumin, transferrin, prothrombin time) improvements were more marked in patients treated with nutritional supplementation and/or oxandrolone than in those given standard therapy alone. Liver volumes fell in all treatment groups, with greater improvement in those treated with nutritional supplementation. Improvements in galactose and antipyrine metabolism rates were significant only in those treated with nutritional supplementation or oxandrolone. Effects of treatments on metabolic balances, nitrogen metabolism, and measures of nutrition are described in this issue in a companion paper. We conclude that the addition of nutritional supplementation and oxandrolone to standard therapy of moderately severe or severe alcoholic hepatitis is well tolerated, and leads to more rapid improvement in the laboratory parameters measured.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with moderately severe or severe alcoholic hepatitis, described in a companion paper in this issue, had serial studies of energy and protein metabolism and elemental balances before and during treatment for 21 days with one of four randomly assigned regimens: 1) standard therapy, consisting of abstinence, a balanced, nutritionally adequate diet, and multivitamins; 2) oxandrolone (20 mg orally four times a day) plus standard therapy; 3) nutritional supplementation, consisting of 2 liters of 3.5% crystalline amino acids in 5% dextrose given by peripheral vein (PPN) plus standard therapy; and 4) a combination of the other three treatments. Dietary and intravenous intakes and weights were recorded daily, and weekly averages were calculated. Anthropometric measurements and blood studies were done weekly; blood studies included white blood cell counts and differentials, serum prealbumin, transferrin, and total protein and plasma aminograms. Four-days complete balance studies and measures of 15N,1-13C-leucine metabolism also were performed at baseline and after the treatment period. Major findings were as follows: a) Intakes of total calories and protein were significantly higher in PPN-treated than in other groups. b) All patients had positive elemental balances, both at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. However, those treated with PPN (with or without oxandrolone) had higher positive balances of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium, indicating improvement in lean body mass. c) Anthropometric measurements showed no significant changes, but measures of the visceral protein compartment (serum prealbumin, transferrin, total protein, total lymphocyte count) improved significantly with time. For most of these variables, increases were significantly greater in those treated with PPN with or without oxandrolone than in the other groups. However, for prealbumin, the increase was greatest in the oxandrolone-treated group d) PPN treatment produced dramatic increases in levels of branched-chain amino acids and improvement in the ratio of plasma branched chain to aromatic amino acids. Other treatments had no effect on plasma aminograms. e) Metabolism of 15N,1-13C-leucine was normal and was not affected significantly by treatment. Therapy with PPN and/or oxandrolone was tolerated well. We conclude that PPN has favorable effects on energy and protein metabolism in florid alcoholic hepatitis; oxandrolone has lesser effects, although it may exert some additional action and particularly increases serum prealbumin levels. The results support the use of nutritional supplementation in therapy of moderately severe or severe alcoholic hepatitis.\r"

The first 50 anti-HCV-positive patients with clinically suspected chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis were studied. Blood transfusions (58%) and intravenous drug use (22%) were the source of infection in most of these patients. A significant difference in age-related epidemiology was observed (p = 0.001). A remote history of intravenous drug use or tattoo application was elicited in 55% of individuals less than 40 yr old. \"Sporadic\" transmission occurred in 28% of individuals older than 50 yr. Sixteen percent (8/50) had no identifiable risk factors. Five of these eight patients (63%) were born and raised outside North America. Eighty percent of the 35 persons who underwent liver biopsy were found to have either chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis. Twenty-nine percent (5/17) of the patients with anti-HCV-related cirrhosis presented with hepatocellular carcinoma. None of the patients with noncirrhotic liver disease had a primary liver tumor. We conclude that a significant number of patients in suburban America with chronic hepatitis C have no identifiable risk factors for HCV. Sporadic transmission of hepatitis C may play an important role in patients with chronic HCV-related liver disease, especially among patients born and raised outside North America.\r"

The patient developed chronic hepatitis with persistently elevated serum aminotransferase activities. Both hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid and antibody to hepatitis C virus persisted in serum, together with elevated serum aminotransferases. Thus, detection of HCV RNA may be useful in the diagnosis of acute type C hepatitis, particularly in the absence of detectable antibody to the hepatitis C virus.\r"

Recently Goate et al. identified in codon 717 of this gene a missense mutation which segregates with AD in a familial AD (FAD) kindred. The same mutation was also found in affected subjects from a second FAD family but not in other FAD families or in normal controls. The following work was undertaken to determine the frequency of the codon 717 mutation in FAD and nonfamilial AD cases and in normal controls. We tested 76 FAD families, 127 \"sporadic\" AD subjects, 16 Down syndrome cases, and 256 normal controls for this mutation, and none were positive. We also tested for the APP codon 693 mutation associated with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type, for PRIP gene missense mutations at codons 102, 117, and 200, and for the PRIP insertion mutations which are associated with Creutzfeld-Jakob disease and Gerstmann-Straussler Scheinker syndrome. No examples of these mutations were found in our population. Thus these APP and PRIP mutations are rare in both FAD and nonfamilial AD.\r"

  ".U": "91353572\r", 
  ".W": "GM1-gangliosidosis is a genetic neurological disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase gene. While its phenotypic expression is complex, it is usually classified as being of infantile, juvenile, or adult form, on the basis of age at onset, the rate of symptomatic progression, and severity of central nervous system involvement. We have analyzed the acid beta-galactosidase gene in 12 Japanese patients from nine families. The aim was to identify mutations in individual patients and then to examine possible correlation between the mutations and the clinical phenotypes. Northern blotting studies with a full-length human beta-galactosidase cDNA showed that the mRNA ranged from undetectable to substantially decreased in the infantile patients but was normal in quantity and size in all juvenile and adult patients. Four distinct missense mutations have been identified, each limited to the respective clinical forms within our small-size samples. In the infantile patient with decreased but detectable mRNA, a point mutation was found resulting in Arg49----Cys. In the infantile patient with nearly undetectable mRNA, mutation Arg457----Ter was identified. The mutation Arg201----Cys was found in all four of the juvenile patients, while all six adult patients were homozygous for the point mutation Ile51----Thr. The mutations found in the juvenile and adult patients alter restriction sites in the normal gene and thus are amendable to quick screening. The prediction that these mutations are responsible for the clinical disease was confirmed by no expression of the catalytic activity of the mutant proteins in the COS-I cell expression system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, we here report evidence for an IDDM-TCRB relationship which is dependent on immunoglobulin heavy-chain-region genes. We analyzed 198 unrelated diabetics and 84 normal siblings (maximum one sibling per diabetic) typed for the BglII TCRB RFLP and Gm immunoglobulin allotypes Glm(1), Glm(2), G2m(23), and G3m(5), which identify the four common Gm haplotypes. The BglIII TCRB genotype frequencies were significantly different between diabetics positive and negative for G2m(23) (P = .017) and G3m(5) (P = .021) but were not different between normal siblings positive and negative for those allotypes (P = .94 and P = .77, respectively). Thus, there were significant interactions between TCRB, Gm, and IDDM for two of the four immunoglobulin allotypes examined. We have previously reported interactions between HLA, Gm (particularly G2m(23)), and IDDM and postulate that the TCRB-Gm-IDDM and HLA-Gm-IDDM interaction effects may be functionally related.\r"

  ".U": "91353580\r", 
  ".W": "Infantile-onset glycogen storage disease type II, or Pompe disease, results from a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha glucosidase (GAA). Sequencing of the cDNA from a cell line (GM 244) derived from a patient with Pompe disease demonstrated a T953-to-C transition that predicted a methionine-to-threonine substitution at codon 318. The basepair substitution resulted in loss of restriction-endonuclease sites for NcoI and StyI. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed both a normal and an abnormal NcoI fragment, indicating that the patient was a genetic compound. NcoI and StyI digestion of cDNA, amplified by PCR from reverse-transcribed RNA, demonstrated that greater than 95% of the GAA mRNA in GM 244 was derived from the allele carrying the missense mutation. The missense mutation was uncommon, since it was not detected in 37 additional GAA-deficient chromosomes, as determined by digestion of genomic DNA with NcoI and hybridization. The amino acid substitution predicts a new potential site for N-linked glycosylation, as well as major changes in secondary structure of the protein. We could confirm that the mutation was responsible for the enzyme deficiency by demonstrating that a hybrid minigene containing the mutation did not express GAA enzyme activity after transient gene expression. We have therefore now provided the first identification of a single-basepair missense mutation in a patient with Pompe disease and furthermore have demonstrated that the patient is a genetic compound with the second allele barely expressing mRNA.\r"

Expression of the mutant DNA encoding a proline-for-leucine substitution at amino acid 444 (L444P) resulted in a catalytically defective, unstable acid beta-glucosidase in either fibroblasts from L444P/L444P homozygotes or in insect cells. This mutation was found to be homoallelic in subacute neuronopathic (type 3) Gaucher disease. In comparison, expression of the mutant cDNA encoding an arginine-for-proline substitution at amino acid 415 (P415R) resulted in an inactive and unstable protein in insect cells. This allele was found only in a type 2 patient with the L444P/P415R genotype. The substantial variation in the type 3 phenotype (L444P homozygotes) suggests the complex nature of the molecular basis of phenotypic variation in Gaucher disease. Yet, the association of neuronopathic phenotypes with alleles producing severely compromised (L444P) or functionally null (P415R) enzymes indicates that the effective level of residual activity at the lysosome is likely to be a major determinant of the severity of Gaucher disease.\r"

  ".W": "Published studies relating to whether medicinal stress-bleeding prophylaxis leading to an increase of gastric pH favors the development of bronchopulmonary infections are reviewed. Results from studies in healthy humans, patients with ulcer disease, and patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) clearly show that the risk of gastric bacterial colonization significantly increases relative to increasing gastric pH. Moreover, a drug-induced increase of gastric pH leads directly to gastric bacterial colonization also in patients in the ICU, above all with bacteria typical of the gastrointestinal tract. Comparing the different bacterial spectra of the oropharynx, stomach, and upper small intestine, it becomes clear that the stomach is a reservoir of bacteria independent of the oropharynx and also subject to retrograde colonization due to the duodenogastric reflux. Both by means of microbiological and in particular direct detection procedures, it can be demonstrated that in at least 30-40% of intubated patients a gastropulmonary route of colonization occurs. In patient groups without a medication-induced increase of gastric pH the number of bacteria detected in the tracheal secretion is about 33% less than in the case of conventional stress-bleeding prophylaxis. These findings make it understandable that a highly significant increase in the pneumonia rate is seen in patients receiving pH-increasing stress-bleeding prophylaxis versus control groups without therapy essentially influencing gastric pH. A risk score was developed that allows an easy description of those patients who are at an increased risk of pulmonary infections due to the gastropulmonary route of colonization.\r"

  ".U": "91353657\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown, using a gastric chamber model, that both sucralfate and luminal stasis protected the rat gastric mucosa against the development of hemorrhagic erosions produced by subsequent exposure for 10 minutes to acidified (50 mM HCl) 80 mM sodium taurocholate (NaT). The protection afforded by sucralfate was abolished by inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity but restored by sucralfate. In this study we demonstrate that indomethacin pretreatment decreases both the depth (in microns) and magnitude (in pH units) of the juxtamucosal pH gradient, but that sucralfate restores these parameters to levels characteristic of normal mucosae. The cytoprotective effect of sucralfate is thus prostaglandin-independent and, at least in part, a consequence of sucralfate-induced increases in the thickness of the juxtamucosal pH gradient/unstirred layer. We have also examined the ability of sucralfate to prevent the otherwise inevitable development of hemorrhagic erosions when it was applied after the gastric mucosa was exposed to NaT. When 100 mg sucralfate in 50 mM HCl was applied for 10 minutes, without stirring, subsequent to a 10-minute exposure of the mucosa to NaT, the average lesion area was reduced from about 15% to less than 3%. Unlike its cytoprotective property, the ability of sucralfate to accelerate the recovery process after damage was abolished by indomethacin pretreatment. Studies using antimony microelectrodes revealed that indomethacin pretreatment resulted in reductions in both the depth and magnitude of the pH gradient that resulted from plasma efflux from the mucosa after exposure to the acidified bile salt. These studies demonstrate that sucralfate is capable not only of prevention or attenuation of acute damage when administered prior to damaging agents, but is also capable of arresting the sequence of events that produces hemorrhage in the previously inflamed or damaged stomach.\r"

Data derived from the selection process were analyzed over a three-year period, 1986-1989. Statistical analysis of the data showed that as few as three experienced faculty members were needed to interview reliably. The statistically significant correlation (p less than .01) between those who interviewed and those who did not interview was necessarily influenced by the fact that those who did not interview had access to the narrative descriptors of those who did.

  ".W": "This 1990 study examines the relationship between the degree of use of patient care resources and the degree of supervision of residents by attending physicians (as perceived by residents) at a large midwestern teaching hospital. Ratings of the degree of clinical autonomy allowed residents by 65 attending physicians--each of whom had a general internal medicine practice with a significant hospital component--were provided by 23 former internal medicine chief residents and 17 internal medicine residents who were in their third year at the time of the study. A regression model was used to test the association between hospital resource use (as shown by total hospital charges to patients and their lengths of stay) and the residents' mean ratings of the degrees of autonomy the attending physicians permitted residents, for 7,169 of these physicians' patients discharged between 1986 and 1989 in 28 diagnosis-related groups. The analysis was controlled for patients' insurance status and chronic disease comorbidities. The patients whose attending physicians were rated as allowing substantial clinical autonomy had significantly lower total charges and lengths of stay (p less than .0001). These results suggest that internal medicine residents have an inherently conservative practice style that values low-intensity workups and rapid discharge of patients.\r"

Crude cell lysates from control cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV-1-infected and control individuals were coamplified using optimized concentrations of primers directed at both loci, followed by simultaneous hybridization with radioactively labeled HIV-1-gag and HLA-DQ-alpha probes. Simultaneous quantitation of the 242-base-pair HLA and 115-base-pair HIV products was accomplished by both end-point dilution analysis and image analysis of autoradiographs relative to standard curves derived from infected cell lines. We observed good agreement between input cell counts on fresh samples and the HLA-DQ-alpha target copy number values determined by both end-point dilution analysis and comparison of band intensities with standard curves. HIV-1 proviral load in symptomatic patients ranged from 200 to 4000 HIV-PCR-units per 1 x 10(6) PBMC (mean of 1245 copies), whereas asymptomatic patients had levels ranging from two to 1000 HIV-PCR-units per 1 x 10(6) PBMC (mean of 213 copies). This HIV/HLA coamplification approach should be particularly useful for analysis of frozen repository samples from natural history studies, and may facilitate wider application of quantitative PCR analysis.\r"

  ".W": "Recent epidemiological and virological data suggest that the incidence of maternofetal transmission of HIV-1 infection is between 20 and 30%. The available evidence points to a possible role of peri- and postnatal contamination, but the isolation of HIV from fetuses shows that transplacental transmission also occurs. We attempted to detect, by means of an immunohistochemical method, HIV proteins in frozen placentas from 75 HIV-1-positive women (30 at term, 45 induced abortions). In addition, in situ hybridization using HIV-specific probes was performed in three cases. Neither HIV proteins nor nucleic acid sequences were detected, but CD4+ mononuclear cells were present in the chorion and villi, regardless of the clinical and biological status of the mother (particularly in the nine cases in which the infants were infected). There are several possible mechanisms involving the placenta in the maternofetal transmission of HIV, including active transport of the HIV-immunoglobulin G complex via Fc receptors on trophoblastic cells, passive transplacental passage of HIV during a viraemic episode, the passage of infected maternal cells, and infection of the placenta itself. The methods we used could not rule out the presence of HIV DNA provirus within the genome of placental cells. In any event, immunohistochemical detection of HIV proteins in the placenta is not a technique suitable for the prenatal diagnosis of HIV infection or for identifying newborns likely to develop HIV infection.\r"

DESIGN--An open pilot study. SETTING--District general hospital. PATIENTS--33 suitable consecutive patients presenting within six hours of the onset of symptoms who satisfied the electrocardiographic criteria for acute myocardial infarction. INTERVENTIONS--Two intravenous boluses of 35 mg alteplase, 30 minutes apart. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Angiographic coronary patency at 90 minutes and 24 hours. Plasma alteplase concentration-time profile and pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS--Coronary patency at 90 minutes: 26 of 30 arteries (87%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 74-99%). Coronary patency at 24 hours: 24 of 29 arteries (83%, CI 69-97%). Mean (SD) plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentration reached 4434.8 (2117.8) and 4233.3 (2217.5) ng/ml within 10 minutes of each bolus and fell to 425.8 (288.3) ng/ml between boluses. The estimated peak concentrations at two minutes after boluses were 12,389 (8580) ng/ml and 10,811 (6802) ng/ml. The derived pharmacokinetic variables were volume of distribution 3.11 (1.89) 1, clearance 21.3 (9.3) 1/h, half life 5.9 (1.7) minutes. CONCLUSIONS--This simple administration regimen achieved brief, high concentrations of plasma t-PA that were well tolerated. The regimen was associated with a high coronary patency rate at 90 minutes that was well maintained at 24 hours.\r"

PATIENTS--52 patients randomised to receive either continuous treatment (23 patients) or intermittent treatment with an individually titrated dose (29 patients) for 14 days: both treatments were compared with placebo in a cross-over fashion. INTERVENTION--Continuous treatment with 10 mg per 24 hours of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate or intermittent transdermal glyceryl trinitrate titrated to give an arbitrary 10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure (mean dose 18.2 mg) given over approximately 16 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Treadmill exercise stress testing and ambulatory monitoring of the ST segment after 14 days' treatment. RESULTS--After 14 days' intermittent treatment resting supine and standing systolic blood pressure fell by 7.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 12.2) and 9.0 mm Hg (95% CI 3.4 to 14.5) respectively (p less than 0.01); resting heart rate was unchanged. Mean heart rate at 1 mm ST segment depression rose by 11.9 beats/min (CI 1.1 to 23.7) (p less than 0.05), mean time to onset of angina increased by 59 seconds (CI 10.8 to 108) (p less than 0.05), and total exercise duration increased by 40 seconds (p less than 0.05). These changes were not seen after continuous treatment. The frequency of ischaemic episodes was not reduced with either regimen nor was the circadian distribution of these episodes altered, in particular nocturnal episodes did not increase during intermittent treatment. CONCLUSION--Tolerance to glyceryl trinitrate was avoided by the use of individually titrated doses administered with a nocturnal nitrate free period. There was no evidence of \"rebound\" on ambulatory monitoring during this treatment.\r"

  ".W": "In the hematopoietic system the adherent stromal cells produce cytokines necessary for proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. In the present study, we showed the ability of adherent stromal cells to generate novel metabolites of arachidonic acid via the NADPH-cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase system. These metabolites were recovered in the incubation media, suggesting their release from cells. The formation of arachidonic acid metabolites was inhibited by 7-ethoxyresorufin and SKF-525A, but not by indomethacin or BW-755C. By using two-step high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), bone marrow-adherent stromal cells and incubation media showed the presence of metabolites in a peak eluted at 19 to 20 minutes. The isolated HPLC peak was used to measure its effect on colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) growth and compare it with that of synthetic cytochrome P450 arachidonate metabolites, 19- and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (HETE) acid. These bone marrow cytochrome P450 arachidonic acid metabolites at picomolar concentration potentiated erythropoietin (Epo)-induced CFU-E growth by fourfold to sixfold. Addition of 19- and 20-HETE to the bone marrow culture resulted in a potentiating effect on CFU-E number in a dose-dependent manner. 20-HETE was much more potent in stimulating CFU-E growth than 19-HETE at a similar concentration of 10(-11) mol/L. The potentiating effect of 20-HETE resulted in a shifting to the left of the dose-response curve to Epo. To substantiate the finding of an active NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450-metabolizing system, we further examined the ability of adherent cells to metabolize exogenous pharmacologic compounds such as benzo(a)pyrene, a substrate for the heme-cytochrome P450 system, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase. The adherent stromal cytochrome P450 metabolizes benzo(a)pyrene at comparable levels to blood vessel endothelial cells. These novel observations underscore the importance of adherent stromal cytochrome P450 to metabolize endogenous substrates, including arachidonic acid, to compounds that may interact in a paracrine manner with Epodependent hematopoietic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG), and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) were followed over 24 hours in 30 patients treated with alteplase for acute myocardial infarction. Samples were taken at baseline (T Oh), after 90 minutes (under alteplase, no heparin, T 1.5h), after 120 minutes (under alteplase and heparin, T 2h), 30 minutes after thrombolytic therapy (T 3.5h), as well as 12 hours (T 12h) and 24 hours (T 24h) after baseline. PAI-1 antigen levels (55 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh, mean +/- SEM) decreased to 35 +/- 5 (T 1.5h) and 40 +/- 6 (T 2h) ng/mL under alteplase, before increasing to 84 +/- 22 (T 3.5h), 130 +/- 30 (T 12h), and 64 +/- 7 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy, P less than .001. A high baseline PAI-1 activity (18 +/- 3 ng/mL) decreased to 2.0 +/- 0.4 (T 1.5h) and 1.7 +/- 0.2 (T 2h) under alteplase and increased to 32 +/- 5 (T 12h) and 19 +/- 3 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy (P less than .0001). beta TG levels (339 +/- 105 ng/mL at T Oh) decreased to 203 +/- 48 (T 2h), 154 +/- 51 (T 3.5h), 187 +/- 40 (T 12h), and 142 +/- 32 (T 24h) ng/mL under heparin (P less than .01). FPA levels (34 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh) increased to 85 +/- 15 ng/mL under alteplase alone (T 1.5h) and normalized under heparin (11 +/- 4, 6 +/- 2, 4 +/- 2, and 3 +/- 1 ng/mL at T 2h, T 3.5h, T 12h, and T 24h, respectively). A high level of FPA at T 3.5h correlated with reocclusion (33 +/- 12 ng/mL, n = 4 v 2.9 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, n = 21, P less than .005). We conclude that plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen as well as activity markedly increase after alteplase therapy of acute myocardial infarction. The high activity of PAI-1 and decreasing beta TG levels suggest that platelets do not contribute significantly to this phenomenon. The marked increase of FPA levels under recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator alone and its normalization under heparin emphasize the important role of concomitant anticoagulation in controlling further intravasal fibrin generation under alteplase.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported earlier that immunodepletion of extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI) sensitizes rabbits to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) induced by infusing a low concentration of tissue factor (TF). We now describe the effect of immunodepletion of EPI in rabbits administered endotoxin. Cortisone-treated rabbits were administered anti-rabbit EPI immunoglobulin (IgG) or Fab fragments or were administered control nonimmune material before an injection of endotoxin. In four of seven rabbits administered anti-EPI, plasma EPI activity levels were reduced by 70% to 80% of initial levels for 6 to 8 hours. In these rabbits the endotoxin induced extensive DIC, as evidenced by substantial decreases in fibrinogen, factor V, factor VIII, and platelets, and gross hemorrhagic necrosis of the kidneys due to massive deposition of fibrin in the glomerular microcirculation (the generalized Shwartzman reaction). In three rabbits administered anti-EPI, plasma EPI levels were only transiently reduced. In these rabbits and in four rabbits administered nonimmune IgG or Fab, endotoxin induced minimal to moderate intravascular clotting and deposits of fibrin were not found in the glomerular capillaries. Because it is believed that TF expressed on monocytes triggers endotoxin-induced coagulation, these data are taken as evidence that EPI functions as a natural anticoagulant that can regulate factor VIIa/TF activity expressed on cell surfaces in vivo. They support a hypothesis that EPI prevents thrombotic complications that might otherwise result from exposure of blood to cytokine-induced generation of small amounts of TF on cell surfaces in many inflammatory and infectious disease states.\r"

Very little is known regarding the normal B cells expressing CRIs (CRI-positive B cells). Using a variety of MoAbs against CRIs we investigated the distribution and topographic localization of CRI-positive B cells in normal adult human lymphoid tissues. We found that CRI-positive B cells represent a significant B-cell subpopulation expressing surface IgM (greater than 90%), IgG (approximately 5%), or IgA (approximately 2%). CRI-positive B cells are homogeneously distributed throughout all lymphoid tissues, accounting for 10% to 15% of all B lymphocytes, with the exception of the thymus, in which they represent the predominant B cell population. Immunophenotypic studies showed (1) that a small subpopulation (3.7% +/- 0.8%) of CRI-positive B cells are activated in vivo, based on CD25 and CD38 antigen expression; and (2) that approximately 50% of CRI-positive B cells express the 67-Kd pan-T-lymphocyte CD5 antigen, suggesting that the CRI-positive B-cell subset and the recently described CD5-positive B-cell subset are closely related. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that CRI-positive B cells produce oligo or polyreactive Igs, which are a characteristic feature of CD5-positive B cells, and also by the fact that both B-cell subpopulations appear to use similar and restricted Ig VH gene family members.\r"

The frequency of VH family use in FL was found to be similar to that reported for normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and is therefore also roughly proportional to VH family size. To evaluate expression within an individual family, all of the lymphoma VH genes from the middle size VH4 family were sequenced and compared with previously published sequences. Of these eight lymphoma VH sequences, six were most closely related to just two of the 10 known functional VH4 germline genes. Nonrandom usage by FL of the JH3, JH4, and JH5 joining segments was also observed. Nucleotide sequences were also determined for 10 randomly selected lymphoma VH genes from the large VH3 family.

  ".W": "Antibody to the recently identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) was investigated in sera of 50 leukemic children who had chronic liver disease (CLD), observed for 1 to 12.6 years after therapy withdrawal. All patients were tested for anti-HCV at regular intervals: Ortho-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was performed in all cases. Reactive sera were also tested by recombinant immunoblotting assay to define the specificity of the results obtained by ELISA. Twelve cases (24%) were persistently positive (group A), 11 (22%) were transiently anti-HCV+ positive (group B), and 27 (54%) were negative. Mean SGPT peak during follow-up was significantly higher in group A (P = .014, A v B and P less than .00001, A v C). SGPT normalized off-therapy in 1 of 12 cases (group A), 10 of 11 (group B), and 19 of 27 (group C) (P = .0004, A v B and P = .012, A v C). Accordingly, liver histology, available in 37 patients, showed signs of chronic hepatitis in all patients in group A while most patients in group B and C had less severe liver lesions. These results indicate that HCV plays a significant role in the etiology of chronic hepatitis in leukemic patients and that persistent anti-HCV activity correlates with a more severe CLD, which could jeopardize the final prognosis of children cured of leukemia.\r"

Increased ANP levels observed during chronic obstruction fell rapidly following urinary tract decompression by urethral catheterisation. Serum ANP resurged briefly within 24 h but stabilised thereafter at a lower level. PRA was initially suppressed but rose after catheterisation, the increase lagging behind the changes seen for ANP. Rising levels of AII and aldosterone followed this trend but, unlike PRA, levels were not completely suppressed in the obstructed state. The observed hormonal changes probably reflect homeostatic mechanisms directed to the maintenance of sodium and water balance during obstruction and to limitation of the diuresis following its relief.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We measured the content and activities of components of the beta-adrenergic receptor-G protein-adenylate cyclase complex and adrenergic neurotransmitter levels in left and right ventricular myocardial preparations derived from 77 end-stage failing human hearts from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) or ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ISCDC). METHODS AND RESULTS. The results were compared with data obtained in 21 nonfailing hearts removed from organ donors. Compared with ISCDC ventricles, IDC left and right ventricles exhibited a greater degree of total beta- or beta 1-receptor downregulation. In contrast, compared with IDC right ventricles, isolated tissue preparations of ISCDC right ventricles exhibited a greater degree of subsensitivity to the inotropic effect of isoproterenol, indicating a relatively greater degree of functional uncoupling of right ventricular ISCDC beta-receptors from mechanical response. In addition, relative to IDC left ventricles, preparations of ISCDC left ventricle exhibited greater subsensitivity to beta-agonist-mediated adenylate cyclase stimulation, indicating functional uncoupling of left ventricular ISCDC beta-receptors from cyclic AMP generation. The uncoupling of beta-receptors in ISCDC left and right ventricles may have been a result of abnormalities in G protein activation of adenylate cyclase; compared with age- and cardiac function-matched respective left or right IDC ventricles, ISCDC left ventricles exhibited less stimulation of adenylate cyclase by NaF or forskolin but no change in Mn2+ stimulation, whereas ISCDC right ventricles exhibited less stimulation by the nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide Gpp (NH)p. Also, IDC right ventricles exhibited a \"selective\" (not present in IDC left ventricles or ISCDC ventricles) decrease in stimulation of adenylate cyclase by Mn2+. Tissue neurotransmitter levels and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation were altered to similar extents in IDC and ISCDC. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that potentially important differences exist in the regulatory behavior of components of the beta-adrenergic receptor-G protein-adenylate cyclase complex in IDC versus ISCDC, differences that presumably relate to the distinct pathophysiologies of these two types of heart muscle disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA or alteplase) and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC or anistreplase) have been demonstrated to limit infarct size significantly and to preserve left ventricular function when injected soon after acute myocardial infarction. However, as yet, the efficacy and safety of these two thrombolytic agents have not been directly compared in one trial; this was the aim of this study. METHODS AND RESULTS. One hundred eighty-three patients suffering from a first acute myocardial infarction were randomly allocated to either APSAC (30 units over 5 minutes) or single-chain rt-PA (100 mg over a 3-hour period) within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms. Global and regional left ventricular function were assessed from contrast angiography an average of 5.3 +/- 2.3 days after initial therapy. Radionuclide angiography and thallium-201 single-photon emission computerized tomography were performed before hospital discharge. Infarct size was assessed by single-photon emission computerized tomography and expressed in percentage of the total myocardial volume. Ninety patients received APSAC and 93 received rt-PA within a mean period of 172 +/- 52 minutes after the onset of symptoms. The two groups were similar in age, location of the acute myocardial infarction, Killip class, and time of randomization. The patency rate of the infarct-related artery was 72% in the APSAC group and 76% in the rt-PA group (NS). Initial and predischarge left ventricular ejection fraction as well as infarct size were similar in both therapeutic groups (0.50 +/- 0.14 versus 0.52 +/- 0.12 for initial and 0.48 +/- 0.10 versus 0.47 +/- 0.10 for predischarge ejection fraction, 11 +/- 7% versus 9 +/- 7% for infarct size, respectively, for APSAC- and rt-PA-treated patients). Bleeding complications requiring blood transfusion occurred in one APSAC patient and in two rt-PA patients. One patient in the rt-PA group died of a massive intracranial hemorrhage. At the end of the 3-week follow-up period, five APSAC patients (5.5%) and seven rt-PA patients (7.5%) had died. CONCLUSIONS. The early infusion of APSAC or rt-PA in acute myocardial infarction produced a similar patency rate, limitation of infarct size, and preservation of left ventricular systolic function with an equivalent rate of bleeding complications.\r"

To study the impact of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) on coronary vasomotion, we prospectively analyzed spontaneous changes in coronary diameter and the response to the cold pressor test and intracoronary nitroglycerin in 11 patients subjected to successful single-vessel PTCA. METHODS AND RESULTS. All antianginal medications were stopped 48 hours before each study. The minimum diameter of the PTCA segment and the diameter of a distal segment in the angioplastied vessel and of a segment in a control vessel not manipulated by the balloon catheter or guide wire were measured by computerized edge detection immediately before PTCA and 5 minutes after, 4 hours after, and 8 days after PTCA. At 4 hours, PTCA and distal segments were constricted by 38 +/- 9% and 16 +/- 5%, respectively, compared with the values at 5 minutes (p less than 0.01). Before angioplasty, the cold pressor test caused vasoconstriction of PTCA and distal segments by 23 +/- 6% (p less than 0.0001) and 15 +/- 4% (p less than 0.008), respectively, but no constrictor response was elicited at 5 minutes or 4 hours after angioplasty. Eight days after PTCA, the basal coronary diameters were similar to those observed 5 minutes after PTCA and the response to the cold pressor test was similar to that observed before PTCA. All segments dilated significantly with nitroglycerin at all times, and no vasoconstriction changes were found in the control segments. CONCLUSIONS. Four hours after PTCA, transient spontaneous vasoconstriction of the PTCA and distal segments occurs, which is so intense that the cold pressor test does not cause any further constriction. These abnormalities resolve within 8 days of PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although first isolated from the porcine brain, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is also found in the heart, particularly in the atria. METHODS AND RESULTS. We examined the immunocytochemical localization of BNP in relation to atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in five porcine atria using highly specific monoclonal antibodies. With the use of an indirect immunoperoxidase method, serial sections examined by light microscopy showed foci of multihormonal myocytes containing both ANP and BNP localized in the subendocardium. Monohormonal myocytes containing ANP only were observed in the subepicardium and part of the subendocardium. The staining intensity of ANP and BNP showed a transmural gradient from the subendocardium to the subepicardium. At the electron microscopic level, double immunocytochemistry using a two-face immunogold-staining method revealed two types of granules: Type 1 is a monohormonal granule containing ANP alone, and type 2 is a multihormonal granule containing both ANP and BNP. Although most atrial myocytes contained both, type 1 granules were frequently observed in the epicardial side, and type 2 granules were frequently observed in the endocardial side. We observed a few type 2 granules even in the light microscopically monohormonal myocytes. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that the atrial myocyte population comprises single, multipotential cells able to synthesize both natriuretic peptides in varying proportions. The atrial transmural gradient of BNP and ANP may be related to responses to wall stress.\r"

  ".U": "91356640\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Chimeric molecules comprising the A-chain of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and the catalytic domain of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) have intact enzymatic characteristics of u-PA, partial fibrin-binding properties of t-PA, and thrombolytic properties in animal models comparable with but not superior to those of single-chain u-PA (scu-PA). Deletion of the finger and growth factor domains (t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e) in such chimeras further reduces their affinity for fibrin. METHODS AND RESULTS. A detailed investigation of the thrombolytic potency and the pharmacokinetics of t-PA and u-PA chimeras was performed in quantitative animal models for thrombolysis. In hamsters with pulmonary embolism, in rabbits with jugular vein thrombosis, and in baboons with femoral vein thrombosis, the thrombolytic potency (percent lysis per milligram of compound administered per kilogram of body weight) of t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e was significantly higher than that of recombinant scu-PA (rscu-PA, Saruplase) as shown by a maximal rate of 720 +/- 170% versus 45 +/- 5% lysis per milligram of compound per kilogram of body weight (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01) in hamsters, 210 +/- 18% versus 49 +/- 3% lysis per milligram of compound per kilogram of body weight (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01) in rabbits, and 310 +/- 73% versus 90 +/- 0.3% lysis per milligram of compound per kilogram of body weight (p less than 0.01) in baboons. However, the specific thrombolytic activity (percent lysis per microgram per milliliter steady-state plasma antigen level) of t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e was not significantly different from that of rscu-PA in hamsters (210 +/- 57% versus 160 +/- 27% lysis per microgram per milliliter antigen level) and was lower than that of rscu-PA in rabbits (37 +/- 4% versus 130 +/- 5% lysis per microgram per milliliter antigen level; p less than 0.01). In dogs with a combined femoral vein blood clot and a platelet-rich femoral arterial eversion graft thrombosis, 0.25 mg/kg body wt bolus injections of t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e produced significantly more venous clot lysis (90 +/- 5%, n = 10) than 0.25 mg/kg rscu-PA (26 +/- 3%, n = 10) (p less than 0.001) and, at the arterial side, more frequent (10 of 10 dogs versus three of 10 dogs) and more persistent (six of 10 dogs versus none of 10 dogs) recanalization (p = 0.002). After bolus injection in hamsters, rabbits, or baboons, t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e had a fourfold to sixfold longer initial half-life than rscu-PA and a slower plasma clearance of sixfold in hamsters, 10-fold in rabbits, and more than 10-fold in baboons. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e has a markedly enhanced thrombolytic potency toward venous and arterial thrombi caused by a delayed in vivo clearance with relatively maintained specific thrombolytic activity. These properties suggest that the chimera may be clinically useful for thrombolytic therapy by bolus administration in patients with thromboembolic disease.\r"

One distal cis-acting regulatory element lies more than 640 base pairs from the transcription initiation site. METHODS AND RESULTS. In this report, we identify two other proximal regulatory elements that lie within 609 base pairs of the transcription initiation site. One proximal regulatory element contains an activator protein-1 (AP-1)-like binding site and is recognized by the AP-1 protein, the c-fos/c-jun proto-oncogene heterodimer in vitro. The second regulatory element contains a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-like recognition site. CONCLUSIONS. In vitro binding of the c-fos/c-jun heterodimer to ANF gene sequences suggests that the heterodimer may play a role in the regulation of gene transcription in vivo. This observation may also explain the correlation between c-fos/c-jun expression and ventricular ANF gene expression found in hypertrophic states. Nuclear extracts from normal cardiocytes contain proteins that bind these regulatory elements but do not appear to bind at the AP-1 site, suggesting that the levels of fos/jun heterodimer in nonhypertrophied cardiocytes are quite low.\r"

  ".U": "91356644\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Arterial injury initiates a proliferative response among the smooth muscle cells of the artery. This leads to the formation of a thickened intima that may reduce the diameter of the arterial lumen. Such intimal lesions often develop after vascular surgery and angioplastic procedures. Previous cell culture studies have shown that the lymphokine, interferon-gamma (gIFN), inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. METHODS AND RESULTS. We therefore tested whether administration of exogenous gIFN could inhibit the development of intimal lesions. Rat carotid arteries were denuded with a balloon catheter, resulting in the formation of a standardized intimal lesion. The animals were then treated with recombinant rat gIFN at 200,000 units (approximately 400,000 units or 100 micrograms/kg body wt) administered parenterally once daily for 7 days. Autoradiographic analysis of 3H-thymidine incorporation revealed that gIFN reduced the early smooth muscle replication by approximately 75%. gIFN treatment for 1 week resulted in a 50% reduction of intimal cross-section area at 2 weeks after injury when compared to control rats injected with buffer alone. The difference in lesion development persisted in rats analyzed 10 weeks after injury, suggesting that proliferative events during the first week determine the long-term development of the intima. Inhibition of lesion development was accompanied by expression of the class II histocompatibility (Ia) gene, RT1B, suggesting that both were directly related to the administration of gIFN. CONCLUSIONS. These results show that gIFN is a potent inhibitor of the formation of arterial proliferative lesions in vivo. It is possible that gIFN could be useful in preventing arterial stenosis after surgery and angioplasty in man.\r"

To investigate whether hypercarbic acidosis independent of oxygenation is of itself detrimental to cardiac resuscitation, three groups of six Sprague-Dawley rats were ventilated with gas mixtures containing concentrations of inspired CO2 (FICO2) of 0.0, 0.3, or 0.5, with oxygen fractions held constant at 0.5. After 4 mins of ventricular fibrillation, mechanical chest compressions were initiated with a pneumatic thumper; 2 mins later, transthoracic defibrillation was attempted. RESULTS: Each animal ventilated with FICO2 of 0.0 or 0.3 was successfully resuscitated. However, none of the animals ventilated with FICO2 of 0.5, in which aortic pH was less than 6.67 and aortic PCO2 was greater than 200 torr (greater than 26.7 kPa), was resuscitated (p less than .001). This finding contrasted with a second control group of seven identically treated animals which, in the absence of cardiac arrest, demonstrated no adverse effects after ventilation with an FICO2 of 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in FICO2 to levels of 0.5 under conditions of constant arterial oxygenation and controlled coronary perfusion pressure preclude successful resuscitation in this rodent model of CPR.\r"

Fifty-nine hypopharyngeal defects were closed using a linear stapler between January, 1984, and April, 1989, at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital of Zurich. Twenty closures were performed following resection of hypopharyngeal diverticula, 39 following wide field laryngectomy. A total of 10 salivary fistulae was observed: 2 after diverticulectomy (10%), 3 after laryngectomy in nonirradiated patients (11%), and 5 after laryngectomy in irradiated patients (45%). These fistula rates are comparable with average rates quoted in the literature. Only after laryngectomy for radiation failure was the fistula rate unusually high. No other complications were seen that could have been attributed to this type of pharyngeal closure. Closure of a hypopharyngeal defect with a stapler is easier and faster than with traditional suture methods. Provided the patient has not been previously irradiated, staple closure of the hypopharynx appears to be as reliable as closure by standard techniques and can be safely recommended.\r"

To determine the role of mucosal involvement in the progression of small bowel Crohn's disease and whether different PHD values can predict different outcomes the changes in PHD values in 41 patients with small bowel Crohn's disease admitted consecutively to our department were investigated. The test was performed during periods of active disease and after either medical or surgical treatment had resulted in improvement. PHD values were significantly lower than in normal subjects (normal range 3.7-7.7 U/ml). In 35 patients with active disease (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) greater than 150) two groups were identified by choosing a cut off value of 2 U/ml: 93% of the 15 patients with PHD values lower than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 1.36 (0.46) U/ml) relapsed at least once in the following year, while only the 20% of the 20 whose values were higher than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 3.69 (1.50)) relapsed in the same period. The data were statistically significant (Yates's corrected chi 2 = 15.63; p less than 0.0001). The positive and negative predictive values of the test were 93% and 80%, respectively. During relapses, PHD values were consistently lower than previous values, and increased significantly after effective medical or surgical treatment. In the six patients in whom there were no changes in disease activity (CDAI persistently less than 150), there was no change in PHD values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Release of endothelin-1, a novel potent vasoconstrictor peptide originally isolated from endothelial cells, from cultured bovine endothelial cells has been shown to be stimulated by arginine vasopressin and angiotensin II. To elucidate the cellular mechanism by which endothelin-1 is released by these vasoconstrictors, we tested the effects of several compounds on the agonist-induced endothelin-1 release and studied the changes of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations and phosphoinositide breakdown by these agonists in cultured bovine endothelial cells. Protein kinase C inhibitors (H-7, staurosporine), an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, and an inhibitor of phospholipase C (neomycin), all abolished the agonist-induced endothelin-1 release, whereas the Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine was ineffective. Although synthetic 1,2-diglyceride (diolein) dose dependently stimulated endothelin-1 release, downregulation of protein kinase C after pretreatment with phorbol ester resulted in decreased effects to increase endothelin-1 release by the agonists. Both arginine vasopressin and angiotensin II induced immediate and transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels of fura-2-loaded endothelial cells as well as formation of inositol trisphosphate; the agonist-induced intracellular Ca2+ increases were not affected either by nicardipine or by chelating extracellular Ca2+. The arginine vasopressin- and angiotensin II-induced intracellular Ca2+ increases, inositol trisphosphate formation, and endothelin-1 release were completely abolished by V1-receptor antagonist and saralasin, respectively. It is concluded that arginine vasopressin and angiotensin II stimulate the release of endothelin-1 by a common mechanism, involving receptor-mediated mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C in endothelial cells.\r"

To determine whether sympathetic activity normally interferes with this reflex function we examined in conscious Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats the effect of chemical sympathectomy by 6-hydroxydopamine on the bradycardic response to baroreceptor stimulation induced by raising blood pressure via intravenous phenylephrine boluses; control rats received vehicle. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were also studied because in these animals there is both a baroreceptor reflex impairment and a sympathetic overactivity. Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, calculated as the ratio of the peak increase in pulse interval to the peak increase in mean arterial pressure, was 75% greater in sympathectomized WKY rats than in control WKY rats (1.28 +/- 0.15 versus 0.73 +/- 0.10 msec/mm Hg, mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.01). The sympathectomy-induced increase in sensitivity was even larger in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (1.26 +/- 0.12 versus 0.44 +/- 0.06 msec/mm Hg in sympathectomized SHR versus control SHR, +186%; p less than 0.01) so that the impaired baroreceptor reflex sensitivity observed in control SHR as compared with control WKY rats (-40%, p less than 0.01) was no longer detectable in the sympathectomized groups. To establish whether the sympathectomy-induced potentiation of the reflex was due to an increase in cardiac responsiveness to vagal stimuli, we subjected separate groups of anesthetized, vagotomized SHR and WKY rats to graded electrical stimulation of the right efferent vagus. The bradycardic effects of vagal stimulation, however, were similar in sympathectomized and control animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study of isolated perfused rat lungs, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 0.15 microgram/ml) or platelets (6.7 X 10(4)/ml) alone did not discernibly change the pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) or lung weight (LW). However, the combination of platelets and PMA drastically increased the PAP and LW (delta PAP 26.2 +/- 1.0 mmHg, delta LW 2.7 +/- 0.4 g). delta PAP was positively correlated with the increase in thromboxane B2 produced by infusion of platelets and PMA (thromboxane B2 = 35.6 + 0.97 delta PAP, r = 0.67, P less than 0.01). The hypertension and edema formation induced by PMA and platelets were strongly attenuated by indomethacin, an inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase (delta PAP 5.6 +/- 2.0 mmHg, P less than 0.001; delta LW 0.0 +/- 0.1 g, P less than 0.001), and by imidazole, an inhibitor of thromboxane A2 synthase (PAP 8.0 +/- 2.5 mmHg, P less than 0.001; LW 0.0 +/- 0.3 g, P less than 0.01).

In vitro experiments showed that the capacity of platelets to release oxygen radicals was only 2.6% of that found for granulocytes.

Dogs were anesthetized, intubated, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated with room air to maintain end-tidal CO2 between 4.8 and 5.2%. Using a wedged bronchoscope technique, we measured Rp at functional residual capacity. The relationship between CO2 concentration and Rp was measured at flow rates of 100 and 400 ml/min with 5, 3, 2, 1, and 0% CO2 in air. Measurements were made at the end of a 3-min exposure to each gas. At low flow rates (100 ml/min) responses to hypocapnia were small, whereas at high flow rates (400 ml/min) responses were large. The PC50 (defined as the CO2 concentration required to produce a 50% increase in Rp above baseline Rp established on 5% CO2) at 400 ml/min (1.73%) was significantly larger than that at 100 ml/min (0.38%). We also directly measured the relationship between Rp and flow rate with 5% CO2 (normocapnia) or 1% CO2 (hypocapnia) delivered into the wedged segment. Increases in normocapnic flow caused small but significant decreases in Rp. In contrast, increases in hypocapnic flow from 100 to 400 ml/min caused a 108% increase in Rp. Thus the response to hypocapnia is augmented by increasing flow rate. This interaction can be explained by a simple model that considers the effect of local ventilation-perfusion ratio and gas mixing on the local CO2 concentration at the site of peripheral airway contraction.\r"

Nasal airflow was measured with a mask pneumotachograph, and pressures in the esophagus and oropharynx were measured with a fluid-filled or 5-Fr Millar pressure catheter. Trials of hyperoxic (40% inspired O2 fraction) CO2 rebreathing were performed during quiet sleep. Total pulmonary resistance decreased progressively as end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) increased from 63 +/- 23 to 23 +/- 15 cmH2O.l-1.s in inspiration and from 115 +/- 82 to 42 +/- 27 cmH2O.l-1.s in expiration between room air (PETCO2 37 Torr) and PETCO2 of 55 Torr (P less than 0.05). Lower airway resistance (larynx and lungs) also decreased from 52 +/- 22 to 18 +/- 14 cmH2O.l-1.s in inspiration and from 88 +/- 45 to 30 +/- 22 cmH2O.l-1.s in expiration between PETCO2 of 37 and 55 Torr, respectively (P less than 0.05). Resistance of the supraglottic airway also decreased during inspiration from 7.2 +/- 2.5 to 3.6 +/- 2.5 cmH2O.l-1.s and in expiration from 7.6 +/- 3.3 to 5.3 +/- 4.7 cmH2O.l-1.s at PETCO2 of 37 and 55 Torr (P less than 0.05). The decrease in resistance that occurs within the airway in response to inhaled CO2 may permit greater airflow at any level of respiratory drive, thereby improving the infant's response to CO2.\r"

Lactic acid, (0.5 M) infusion of 0.10, 0.13, and 0.20 ml.min-1.kg-1 at rest and mild and moderate exercise increased arterial [H+] linearly throughout the 10 min of acid infusion. At 10 min of infusion, arterial [H+] had increased approximately 20 nmol/l (0.2 pH units) for each condition and group. Under most conditions, the temporal pattern of PaCO2 during acid infusion was biphasic. At rest and during mild exercise in all groups, and in carotid chemoreceptor-denervated ponies during moderate exercise, PaCO2 increased approximately 2 Torr (P less than 0.05) during the first 2 min of acid infusion. However, in normal ponies during moderate exercise, PaCO2 was not changed from control in the first 2 min of infusion. Between 2 and 10 min of infusion at rest and mild and moderate exercise in all groups, there was a 5-Torr significant decrease in PaCO2, which did not differ (P greater than 0.10) between groups. VE increased between 15-30 s and 2 min of infusion, but VE changed minimally between 2 and 10 min of infusion at rest and exercise in all groups of ponies. We conclude that lactacidosis does increase VE at rest and submaximal exercise in the pony.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The relative content of arachidonic acid (AA) decreased in platelets from all individuals, whereas the content of EPA and DHA increased. The decrease of AA was almost identical with the increase of EPA plus DHA. In plasma the AA content was unchanged, while EPA and DHA increased. The N2 microbubble-induced aggregation showed a significant negative correlation with the DHA content both in platelets and in plasma. Less aggregation was also observed with high EPA content in platelets or plasma. A significant correlation between AA content in platelets and aggregation was seen. Intake of marine oils may be beneficial to divers under deep diving and to patients during extracorporeal circulation, because this may reduce the microbubble-induced aggregation.\r"

A window was prepared in the skull and the brain superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The phosphorescent probe for PO2, Pd-meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine, was injected directly into the systemic blood. The phosphorescence of the probe was imaged, and the lifetimes were measured using flash illumination and a gated video camera. The PO2 in the blood of the veins and capillary beds of the cortex was calculated from the lifetimes. Systemic blood pressure was continuously monitored while the systemic arterial PCO2, PO2, and blood pH were measured periodically. The PO2 in the blood was quantitated for 60- to 200 microns2 regions within the image (from a total field of approximately 3 mm diam). The PO2 in the microvasculature was not uniform across the viewing field but increased or decreased in each region independently of the other regions. Thus at any point in time the PO2 in a region could be substantially above or below the average value. During hyperventilation, which lowered arterial PCO2 and increased pH of the blood, the average PO2 decreased in proportion to the decrease in arterial PCO2. For example, hyperventilation, which decreased arterial PCO2 from its normal value of 40 Torr to 10 Torr, caused a rapid (within 5 min) decrease in PO2 in the blood of capillaries and veins to approximately one-third of normal.\r"

Kinetics of RSV replication, illness, and pathology were assessed after primary infection and rechallenge. Both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte subsets were involved in terminating RSV replication after primary infection. When both T lymphocyte subsets were depleted RSV replication was markedly prolonged, yet no illness was evident, suggesting that host immune response rather than viral cytocidal effect was the primary determinant of disease in mice. Both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes contributed to illness, although CD8+ lymphocytes appeared to play the dominant role in this particular system. Analysis of histological responses suggested that CD4+ lymphocytes were required for the appearance of peribronchovascular lymphocytic aggregates seen in normal mice after rechallenge, and that the presence of alveolar lymphocytes was correlated with illness. It is postulated that antibody is an illness-sparing mechanism for protecting mice from RSV infection, and that T lymphocytes are an important determinant of illness. Further delineation of RSV-induced immunopathogenesis in primary infection and reinfection will provide important information for the development of vaccine strategies.\r"

The mechanisms of microbicidal action are complex and not fully defined. This report describes the MPO-mediated inactivation, in Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, of a class of cytoplasmic membrane enzymes (penicillin-binding proteins, PBPs) found in all eubacteria, that covalently bind beta-lactam antibiotics to their active sites with loss of enzymatic activity. Inactivation of \"essential\" PBPs, including PBP1-PBP3 of E. coli, leads to unbalanced bacterial growth and cell death. MPO treatment of bacteria was associated with loss of penicillin binding by PBPs, strongly suggesting PBP inactivation. In E. coli, PBP inactivation was most rapid with PBP3, where the rate of decline in binding activity approximated but did not equal loss of viability. Changes in E. coli morphology (elongation), observed just before bacteriolysis, were consistent with early predominant inactivation of PBP3. We conclude that inactivation of essential PBPs is sufficient to account for an important fraction of MPO-mediated bacterial action. This feature of MPO action interestingly recapitulates an antibacterial strategy evolved by beta-lactam-producing molds that must compete with bacteria for limited ecologic niches.\r"

Preincubation with Con A, 0.5 micrograms/ml, attenuated 1 microM (-)-norepinephrine (NE)-induced downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and resulted in a 50% augmentation of cAMP accumulation stimulated by 1 microM NE. Con A also augmented forskolin (1-10 microM)-stimulated cAMP accumulation by an average of 37% (P less than 0.05); however, Con A preincubation had no effect on basal or cholera toxin-stimulated cAMP content. The muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol (1-100 microM) decreased 1 microM NE-stimulated cAMP generation by an average of 32% (n = 7, P less than 0.05); preincubation with Con A further enhanced the inhibitory effect of carbachol by 18% (n = 7, P less than 0.05). Carbachol (1 microM) for 2 h decreased muscarinic cholinergic receptor density in whole cells by 33%; preincubation with Con A prevented this receptor downregulation. Con A pretreatment did not affect (-)-isoproterenol- or forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in cell homogenates, suggesting that an intact cytoarchitecture is necessary for Con A to augment cAMP formation. We conclude that Con A, through its modulation of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor signaling, amplifies both stimulatory and inhibitory adenylate cyclase-linked pathways in intact neonatal ventricular myocytes. These data suggest the possibility that plasma membrane-cytoskeletal interaction is an important regulator of transmembrane signaling because interference with this interaction results in alterations in cAMP accumulation mediated by both beta-adrenergic- and muscarinic cholinergic-adenylate cyclase pathways.\r"

As shown by two-dimensional nonreduced/reduced agarose/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the structure of circulating vWf molecules may deviate from that represented by assemblage of a variable number of identical subunits. Indeed, even though the largest multimers in normal plasma appear to be composed predominantly of intact 225-kD subunits, those of intermediate and smaller size contain also 189-, 176-, and 140-kD proteolytic fragments. Different subunit composition patterns are repeated regularly in multimers of increasing molecular mass, yielding series of bands with similar structure. One of these series consists of molecules without evidence of proteolytic fragmentation, and its smallest member appears to be a dimer of 225-kD subunits. Type IIA von Willebrand disease, characterized by absence of the largest multimers, displays a pattern wherein the fragments of 176 and 140 kD are relatively increased, that of 189 kD is markedly decreased or absent, but the composition of individual multimers is otherwise similar to that of species seen also in normal plasma. In contrast to those in the circulation, all normal platelet vWf multimers contain only intact subunit. These results suggest that proteolytic cleavage of plasma vWf subunits occurs after release from cellular sites, whereas platelet vWf stored in alpha-granules is protected from proteolysis. These findings provide information that may be relevant for understanding the normal processing of vWf multimers and for elucidating the pathogenesis of some of the congenital and acquired structural abnormalities of this molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin deficiency decreases tissue protein synthesis, albumin mRNA concentration, and albumin synthesis in rats. In contrast, insulin deficiency does not change, or, paradoxically, increases estimates of whole body protein synthesis in humans. To determine if such estimates of whole body protein synthesis could obscure potential differential effects of insulin on the synthetic rates of individual proteins, we determined whole body protein synthesis and albumin and fibrinogen fractional synthetic rates using 5-h simultaneous infusions of [14C]leucine and [13C]bicarbonate, in six type 1 diabetics during a continuous i.v. insulin infusion (to maintain euglycemia) and after short-term insulin withdrawal (12 +/- 2 h). Insulin withdrawal increased (P less than 0.03) whole body proteolysis by approximately 35% and leucine oxidation by approximately 100%, but did not change 13CO2 recovery from NaH13CO3 or estimates of whole body protein synthesis (P = 0.21). Insulin deficiency was associated with a 29% decrease (P less than 0.03) in the albumin fractional synthetic rate but a 50% increase (P less than 0.03) in that of fibrinogen. These data provide strong evidence that albumin synthesis in humans is an insulin-sensitive process, a conclusion consistent with observations in rats. The increase in fibrinogen synthesis during insulin deficiency most likely reflects an acute phase protein response due to metabolic stress. These data suggest that the absence of changes in whole body protein synthesis after insulin withdrawal is the result of the summation of differential effects of insulin deficiency on the synthesis of specific body proteins.\r"

To determine the mechanism for the variability in responses to polysaccharides, a panel of well characterized serologic reagents that identify diagnostic primary amino acid sequences in the framework and hypervariable regions of heavy (H) and light (L) chains were created to characterize the variable region diversity in circulating human antibodies. 10 normal adult volunteers were immunized with the type b capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae (Hib PS). By immunoblot analyses each individual was found to use at least three different variable L (VL) families, but all had preferential usage of VH3-derived H chains. Four individuals had lesser populations of VH1-derived H chains and three had populations of VH4-derived H chains, but anti-Hib PS antibodies derived from the VH2, VH5, and VH6 families were not detected. The anti-Hib PS antibodies from all subjects were also identified by serologic markers for two specific types of VH3 H chains. These H chains are structurally related to the 20P1 and 30P1 VH genes that are preferentially rearranged in the early human repertoire. These findings document the VH restriction of physiologic responses to Hib PS immunization, and demonstrate a technique to directly assess the structural and genetic diversity of specific serum antibodies.\r"

This deficiency could be overcome by the addition of supplemental IL-2, IL-4, or IL-6, resulting in the secretion of all Ig isotypes. There were no major differences in the distribution of Ig isotypes secreted in response to the cytokines alone or in combination. The Ig secreted in response to IL-4 or IL-6 was inhibited by MAb to CD25, suggesting that the effects of IL-4 and IL-6 were dependent on IL-2. Stimulation of neonatal lymphocytes with anti-CD3 was sufficient to induce expression of IL-2 receptors (CD25) on both T and B cells. IL-4 exerted direct effects on neonatal T cells by increasing IL-2 production and promoting IL-6 production by anti-CD3-stimulated neonatal lymphocytes. Antibody to IL-4 or IL-6 did not inhibit Ig secretion in response to IL-2 and antibody to IL-6 did not consistently inhibit Ig secretion in response to IL-4. Finally, in the presence of cyclosporin, anti-CD3-stimulated neonatal lymphocytes secreted Ig only with the combination of IL-2 and IL-4. These results have delineated unique, but not Ig isotype-specific, effects of cytokines in supporting Ig secretion by anti-CD3-stimulated neonatal lymphocytes. Deficient production of these cytokines is likely to contribute to the decreased capacity of neonatal lymphocytes to generate an Ig response.\r"

  ".W": "To address the paucity of patient-level data regarding the effectiveness of Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS), we conducted a population-based study of inpatient hospitalizations among individually identified elderly residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, 1970-1987. A 4.3% increase in total days of care/1000 population from 2,652/1,000 in 1970 to 2,766/1,000 in 1980 was followed by a 9.8% decline from 1980 to 1987 (2,495/1,000). The decline was due primarily to a 13.4% decrease in mean length stay (9.7 days in 1980 to 8.4 days in 1987). The number of hospitalizations/1,000 Olmsted County elderly in 1980 was already below 1987 U.S. figures and did not exhibit the decline evidenced nationally between 1980 and 1987. A 4.6% decline in the proportion of county residents age 65-74 years who were hospitalized (174/1,000 in 1980 to 166/1,000 in 1987) was offset by an 8.3% increase for persons age greater than or equal to 75 (252/1,000 to 273/1,000) and by a 5.7% increase in the number of hospitalizations per individual hospitalized for persons age 65-74 years (1.34 to 1.42). Using a time-dependent Cox model, which adjusted for differences in patients characteristics between years, there was a significantly higher risk of readmission within 14 days in 1987 vs 1980 (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-1.70). The difference between years was no longer evident at 30 or 60 days (HR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.63-1.11 between 15 and 30 days; HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.84-1.49 between 31 and 60 days). This study suggests that initial effects of PPS on utilization may be temporary and that more research is needed to appreciate the impact of cost-containment on patient outcome.\r"

The intraperitoneal administration of swainsonine decreased the lethality of methotrexate (MTX), fluorouracil (5-FU), cyclophosphamide (CPM), and doxorubicin (DOX) in non-tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice. The increased survival rate was found to correlate with stimulation of bone marrow cell proliferation, as measured by increases in 1) bone marrow cellularity, 2) in vivo and in vitro colony-forming activity, and 3) engraftment efficiency. These responses were critically dependent on the dose, sequence, and timing of swainsonine administration. If these results are confirmed in humans, swainsonine may offer promise in future intensive chemotherapy programs, allowing increased dosage and/or frequency of administration of cytotoxic agents without increasing toxic effects in bone marrow.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effect of drug resistance on the response of stage IV astrocytomas to interferon, a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, GBM-18, was transfected with an expression-vector plasmid containing a human multidrug resistance (MDR) gene (pHaMDR1/A), and clones surviving in colchicine were isolated. GBM-18 multidrug-resistant subclones displayed cross-resistance to other chemotherapeutic agents, including vincristine, doxorubicin, and dactinomycin. The multidrug-resistant phenotype was reversible when GBM-18 multidrug-resistant cells were cultured in colchicine and the calcium-channel blocker verapamil. The level of the MDR1 gene (also known as PGY1) message was increased in GBM-18 multidrug-resistant cells selected for increased resistance to colchicine, and this effect was not correlated with an amplification of the MDR1 gene. In both parental GBM-18 and GBM-18 multidrug-resistant cells, growth was suppressed to a greater degree when cultures were treated with the combination of fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) and immune interferon (IFN-gamma). Parental cells and multidrug-resistant subclones varied in their de novo and/or interferon-modulated expression of HLA class I and class II antigens, a high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Of the antigens tested, ICAM-1 and HLA class I antigens were the most sensitive to enhanced expression induced by IFN-beta and IFN-gamma when used alone or in combination. The results of the present study indicate that multidrug-resistant human glioblastoma multiforme cells retain their increased sensitivity to the antiproliferative activity of the combination of IFN-beta plus IFN-gamma, and differences in antigenic phenotype are apparent in independent multidrug-resistant glioblastoma multiforme clones.\r"

One potential vector of this transfer is a semiparasitic mite, Proctolaelaps regalis DeLeon, whose morphology, behavior, and co-occurrence with Drosophila are consistent with the properties necessary for such a vector. Southern blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and DNA sequencing showed that samples of P. regalis associated with a P strain of D. melanogaster carried P element sequences. Similarly, Drosophila ribosomal DNA sequences were identified in P. regalis samples that had been associated with Drosophila cultures. These results have potentially important evolutionary implications, not only for understanding the mechanisms by which genes may be transferred between reproductively isolated species, but also for improved detection of some host-parasite and predator-prey relationships.\r"

This is surprising because the mice were not exposed to HIV. Furthermore, anti-anti-MHC antibodies (molecules that have shapes similar to those of major histocompatibility complex molecules) were detected in both alloimmune sera and MRL mice. These results are discussed in the context of a possible role for allogeneic stimuli in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, as suggested by an idiotypic network model.\r"

  ".U": "91361089\r", 
  ".W": "Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) may function widely in calcium-mediated cell signaling, but has been most thoroughly characterized in muscle cells. In a homogenate of sea urchin eggs, which display transients in the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) during fertilization and anaphase, addition of Ca2+ triggered CICR. Ca2+ release was also induced by the CICR modulators ryanodine and caffeine. Responses to both Ca2+ and CICR modulators (but not Ca2+ release mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) were inhibited by procaine and ruthenium red, inhibitors of CICR. Intact eggs also displayed transients of [Ca2+]i when microinjected with ryanodine. Cyclic ADP-ribose, a metabolite with potent Ca(2+)-releasing properties, appears to act by way of the CICR mechanism and may thus be an endogenous modulator of CICR. A CICR mechanism is present in these nonmuscle cells as is assumed in various models of intracellular Ca2+ wave propagation.\r"

In these tests, this new system was compared with a currently marketed closed drainage system, with daily challenge at the outlet tube using an auxotrophically marked uropathogenic strain of Escherichia coli. In the control series (silicone catheter connected to a standard drainage bag via a tamper-evidence seal) the challenge organism developed upstream biofilm colonization of the luminal surfaces of the catheter and drainage system that was complete in 4.6 +/- 2.1 days in 11 animals, while in 1 animal a rapid overgrowth of the system with Streptococcus faecalis developed. The presence of organisms other than the marked E. coli strain on the luminal surfaces of these control catheters showed that down stream colonization was also operative. In the test catheter drainage series, the microbicidal outlet tube insert precluded upstream colonization by the challenge organism in 12 of 16 catheters and significantly delayed (7.2 +/- 1.0 days) this colonization in the remaining 4 animals. When upstream colonization by exogenous bacteria was precluded by this effective device, downstream colonization of the drainage system by mixed populations of bacteria that probably migrated into the bladder via the extraluminal urethral route developed in some animals (6 of 16).\r"

Immunohistochemistry using anti-prion protein (PrP) and anti-beta/A4 protein (beta/A4) coupled with formic acid pretreatment could detect Congophilic and non-Congophilic deposits. Prion protein deposits were classified into five types and compared with types of beta/A4 deposits. Kuru plaques with multicentric cores and fine granular deposits were a characteristic feature of PrP deposits. Some types of PrP or beta/A4 deposits depend on the anatomic sites. To clarify the relationship of microglia and astrocytes to PrP or beta/A4 deposits, double-immunostaining method was performed. In both kuru and senile plaques, microglia were closely linked to the Congophilic plaques. Astrocytes, however, extended their processes toward the plaques even in the non-Congophilic plaques. These observations strongly suggest that similar glial association with plaque formation may be involved in both kuru and senile plaques, although the amyloid core proteins differ.\r"

  ".U": "91361968\r", 
  ".W": "Antibodies directed against three regions of tau have been used in a histologic study of granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Granulovascular degeneration complexes, consisting of a dense granule in a less-dense vacuole, were found in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in all patients studied. Anti-tau antibodies directed against the N-and C-termini, and the repeat region of tau, were found to immunolabel the granule of the GVD complex. Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles also were labeled by these antibodies. In particular, MAb6.423, which recognizes tau protein sequestered in paired helical filaments (PHF) in AD, but not the normal tau proteins so far described in human brain, labeled GVD granules. Contrarily, a generic tau marker (MAb7.51), which immunolabels all known isoforms of isolated and expressed tau protein, including PHF-tau, did not label the GVD granule. These findings demonstrate that the entire tau molecule is sequestered within the GVD granule, and that the tau protein found in GVD complexes is antigenically related to that found in PHFs. There is, however, a difference in the way in which the repeat region of tau is incorporated into the two structures, making the MAb7.51 epitope unavailable in the GVD complex. These findings suggest that the formation of GVD complexes in hippocampal pyramidal neurons vulnerable to neurofibrillary degeneration may represent an alternative pathway for dealing with an aberrant molecular complex, which contributes to the formation of GVD granules and neurofibrillary tangles in AD.\r"

  ".W": "The pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves subcortical as well as cortical structures. The authors have used immunohistochemical methods to study the molecular composition of AD plaques in the hypothalamus. In contrast to previous studies using histochemical methods, the authors observed large numbers of diffuse plaques in the AD hypothalamus labeled with an antiserum to the beta-amyloid, or A4 peptide, of the beta-amyloid precursor proteins (beta APPs), whereas A4-immunoreactive plaques were uncommon in the hypothalamus of patients without AD. Unlike plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients, hypothalamic plaques did not contain epitopes corresponding to other regions of the beta APPs, nor did they contain tau-, neurofilament-, or microtubule-associated protein-reactive epitopes, and did not disrupt the neuropil or produce astrogliosis. These findings demonstrate that there are substantial molecular and cellular differences in the pathologic features of AD in the hypothalamus compared with those observed in hippocampal and cortical structures, which may provide insight into the pathogenetic mechanisms of AD.\r"

There was no measurable change in any of these determinants of liver function. All children accepted daily induction of anaesthesia with isoflurane.
