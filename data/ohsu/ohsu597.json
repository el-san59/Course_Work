The system uses slit lamp and retroillumination photographic standards to grade lens opacities into classes of increasing severity. The authors evaluated the reproducibility and validity of LOCS II before its possible use in a natural history study of age-related cataract. The authors found excellent inter- and intraobserver reproducibility when the LOCS II standard photographs were used for clinical or photographic gradings of cataract. There was a tendency to underestimate posterior subcapsular cataracts on photographic gradings compared with slit-lamp gradings. The accuracy of the photographic gradings of posterior subcapsular opacities tended to decrease as the severity of coexisting opacities increased.\r"

Indices of field reliability (fixation loss, less than 20%; false-positives and false-negatives, less than 33%) and field sensitivity (mean deviation [MD] and pattern standard deviation [PSD]) were examined. At baseline, 35% of patients exhibited low reliability (LR) fields, a figure which decreased to approximately 25% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. During this period, over 50% of patients produced at least one LR field, whereas 8.3% were unable to produce even one reliable field. Exhibition of a LR field appeared to be independent of patient age. Fixation errors, the major cause of LR fields, decreased by approximately 10% over the 12-month period; most patients had between 20 and 32% fixation errors. The incidence of significant defects identified by PSD was greater than that for MD; this was true for both reliable and LR fields. It is suggested that increasing the fixation loss criteria for assessing patient reliability to a 33% cutoff might substantially increase the percentage of fields graded reliable with minimal effect on the sensitivity or specificity of the test.\r"

Large axonal size has been correlated with fast, transiently responding retinal ganglion cells (alpha/Y cells). A second population of cells (X cells) does not follow flicker stimulation to as high a frequency as Y cells. The luminance flicker visual-evoked potential (VEP) shows two response maxima as a function of temporal frequency. These two response peaks may indicate driving of the flicker VEP by two separate neuronal populations, possibly X and Y cells. The authors have recorded flicker VEPs as a function of frequency from both normal subjects and glaucoma patients with asymmetric visual field loss in various stages of their disease. The data obtained demonstrate loss of high flicker rate responses apparently preceding and correlated with perimetric field loss and stage of glaucoma. Flicker VEP responses below 13 Hz tend to be preserved, whereas above this frequency the response attenuation is directly proportional to the severity of visual loss. This technique may provide an early warning of ganglion cell loss in the early stages of this disease.\r"

The retinal nerve fiber layer was most visible in the inferior temporal arcade, followed by the superior temporal arcade, then by the temporal macular area, and finally the nasal area. This distribution was significantly (P less than 0.0001) correlated to (1) the configuration of the neuroretinal rim, which was significantly broadest at the inferior disc pole followed by the superior one, (2) the juxtapapillary caliber of the retinal vessels, which were significantly wider in the inferior temporal arcade than in the superior temporal arcade, and (3) the location of the foveola 0.53 +/- 0.34 mm inferior to the middle point of the vertical optic disc axis. The retinal nerve fiber layer decreased with age. No correlation occurred with sex or right or left eye. No localized retinal nerve fiber layer defects were seen. These features of the normal retinal nerve fiber layer are important for diagnosis of retinal nerve fiber layer changes secondary to optic nerve damage in the diseased eye.\r"

  ".W": "A new parameter of structural optic nerve damage from glaucoma is reported, the relative nerve fiber layer surface height (RNFLH). Relative nerve fiber layer surface height is calculated from magnification-corrected surface contour measurements of the peripapillary retina made with computerized image analysis of stereoscopic videographic images. The technique measures the average height of the nerve fiber layer surface within a circumference 200 microns from the disc edge, as detected with narrow-band green light, with respect to a standardized reference plane. This parameter was examined in a group of 36 glaucoma patients with early to moderate visual field loss, and in 33 age-matched normal controls. The measured surface of the peripapillary nerve fiber layer was, on the average, 74 microns lower in glaucomatous eyes than in normal eyes, a statistically significant difference (P = 0.000). The ability of RNFLH to distinguish glaucomatous eyes from normal eyes was tested by its sensitivity (83%) and specificity (88%), which were greater than the sensitivities and specificities of computerized measurements of cup-disc ratio, disc rim area, and cup volume. This approach represents a step toward the identification of quantitative structural parameters to reflect the number of retinal ganglion cell axons that enter the optic nerve. Such measurements may facilitate the early diagnosis of glaucoma and provide important information on rates of ganglion cell death in aging and disease.\r"

Results of slit-lamp examination of all flattened ablated areas show mild superficial haze at the epithelial/stromal interface. This haze might not interfere significantly with vision in patients 7 to 10. Serial pachymetry and keratometry measurements, refraction, and digital keratoscopy show a progressive filling in of the excavated area by approximately two thirds but a loss of initial diopteric correction of only one third. Histopathologic analysis was obtained for four eyes. Transmission electron microscopy of three eyes enucleated 3 to 12 days after ablation shows 40-microns ablation depths through Bowman's layer and superficial stroma with minimal adjacent tissue damage and no inflammatory cells. The epithelium is increased in thickness by 50%, and firmly attached to the underlying stroma. A 4-month postablation specimen shows keratocyte activation with increased protein synthesis (presumed collagen and ground substance).\r"

After radial keratotomy, central optical zones are created that can be characterized as round, oval or band-like, or dumbbell-shaped or split. The dumbbell form of optical zone was associated with larger amounts of refractive and keratometric astigmatism than the round or band-like zones. The authors correlated the shape of the optical zone with the presence or absence of diurnal variation (fluctuation) in visual acuity. Of the 26 eyes studied, 11 experienced fluctuation and 15 did not. Of those 11 eyes with fluctuating visual acuity, 10 (91%) had dumbbell-shaped or split optical zones and 1 (9%) had a round optical zone. Of the 15 eyes without fluctuation, 12 (80%) had round optical zones and 3 (20%) had band-like zones. The presence of a split or dumbbell-shaped optical zone after radial keratotomy indicates that the patient is likely to experience diurnal fluctuation of visual acuity.\r"

The blebs were probably due to intercellular edema, separating endothelial cells from Descemet's membrane, and were reversible after resolution of the keratopathy. If the condition is chronic, changes in endothelial morphology may occur, with pleomorphism and polymegathism of the endothelial cells. These cases show that conditions which cause fine disruption of the corneal epithelium affect the integrity of the corneal endothelium. Recognition of resulting long-term changes may be important before intraocular surgery or if the cornea is to be used for grafting.\r"

The operative technique usually involved transfer of two free grafts of limbal tissue from the uninjured or less injured donor eye to the severely injured recipient eye, the latter having been prepared by limited conjunctival research and superficial dissection of fibrovascular pannus without keratectomy. Clinical results in 21 patients with follow-up of 6 months or more have consistently shown improved visual acuity (17 cases), rapid surface healing (19 cases), stable epithelial adhesion without recurrent erosion or persistent epithelial defect (20 cases), arrest or regression of corneal neovascularization (15 cases), and probable increased success for lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty (8 cases). No intraoperative complications were encountered, and no adverse reactions developed in donor eyes. Impression cytology in selected cases showed restoration of the corneal epithelial phenotype and regression of goblet cells from the recipient cornea. Therefore, limbal autograft transplantation is recommended for treatment of widespread ocular surface damage with loss of limbal epithelial stem cells and, specifically, for chemical or thermal burns, contact lens-induced keratopathy, and selected persistent corneal epithelial defects.\r"

Transscleral iontophoresis (4-6 mAmps for 15 minutes) achieved peak ketoconazole concentrations in the aqueous 1 hour after treatment (10.2 micrograms/ml) and remained at fungicidal therapeutic concentrations for 8 hours; in the vitreous, a peak concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml occurred between 1 and 2 hours posttreatment. Transcorneal iontophoresis (1.5 mAmps for 15 minutes) achieved peak corneal concentration of 27.6 micrograms/ml and peak aqueous concentrations of 1.4 micrograms/ml, both 1 hour after iontophoresis. Fungicidal therapeutic drug concentrations were sustained for 2 hours both in the cornea and in the aqueous. These concentrations were compared with those obtained after subconjunctival injection (peak values): 0.8 microgram/ml in aqueous, 5.9 micrograms/ml in cornea, and 0.7 microgram/ml in vitreous, all within 1 hour of injection. Aqueous and corneal concentrations were significantly higher after transscleral and transcorneal iontophoresis than subconjunctival injection (P less than 0.05). Iontophoresis is proposed as an effective means of delivering high concentrations of ketoconazole to the anterior segment of the eye.\r"

Physiologically, the PT group exhibited no mean differences from the PS group in cortical power densities at the baseline stage. Under the noxious stress of the cold-pressor test, both groups exhibited markedly heightened delta and beta cortical power densities. However, the PS subjects showed significantly higher delta power, but not beta power, than the PT subjects. We conclude that heightened delta activity may reflect the stress component of human pain responsivity, and that beta activity reflects the vigilance scanning of pain processes.\r"

Results of a pilot study in children 6-12 years, with water temperature at 15 degrees C (n = 37) and 12 degrees C (n = 29), indicated that useful data could be obtained from this paradigm. Children's pain ratings increased with duration of arm immersion in the water and with decreasing water temperature. Most importantly, children and their parents perceived the format to be interesting and non-stressful. Continued caution and improved techniques for monitoring the well-being of child participants need to be a part of any future investigations of this type.\r"

The cerebrovascular lesions were located in the lower brain-stem in 8 patients, involved the thalamus in 9 and in 6 were suprathalamic. In 4 patients the location of the CVL could not be determined. All patients had abnormal temperature and pain sensibility, with a severe deficit in most cases. All except 2 had raised thresholds to thermal pain and all except 1 had abnormal sensibility to pin-prick. Eighty-eight percent exhibited hyperpathia with combined loss and suprathreshold exaggeration of somatic sensibility. In 85% somatic stimuli evoked dysaesthesia and about half of these patients also experienced spontaneous dysaesthesia. Paraesthesias were reported by 41%, radiation of stimuli by 50%, after-sensations by 45% and allodynia by 23%. Vibration sensibility was abnormal in 41%; raised thresholds to the perception of touch were found in 52%, to 2-PD in 35%, to dermolexia in 45% and to joint movements in 37%. The results indicate that all patients with CPSP have lesions that affect the major pathways for temperature and pain sensibility, i.e., the spino-thalamo-cortical pathways. Furthermore it appears that neither the level of the lesion along the neuraxis nor concomitant injury to the medial lemniscal pathways is crucial for the development of CPSP. The results confirm the notion that CPSP is a deafferentation syndrome, but they also provide evidence against the hypothesis that CPSP is a release phenomenon caused by a lesion that removes inhibitory influences of the lemniscal pathways on neurones that evoke pain.\r"

Of specific concern in the rehabilitation setting is function-limiting hand pain which prevents optimal participation in therapy and limits independence. A treatable etiology of function-limiting hand pain in SCI is the reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS). The presentation of RSDS in patients with recent SCI can be easily confused with that of dysesthetic (central origin) or radicular pain. Previous reports of RSDS associated with recent traumatic SCI have not been based on specific clinical criteria outlined in recent literature, and treatment has not been evaluated by objective outcome measures. This report describes 5 cases of RSDS associated with recent traumatic SCI that are identified by specific clinical criteria and are confirmed by a 3 phase bone scan. It is suggested that aggressive early intervention is necessary to obtain optimal functional outcome and minimize length of hospital-based rehabilitation.\r"

  ".W": "A transdermal formulation of fentanyl (TTS-fentanyl, Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA) was evaluated in 13 surgical patients after an abdominal operation. An intraoperative dose of fentanyl (100-200 micrograms i.v.) was administered at the same time as the TTS-fentanyl systems (50-125 micrograms/h) were applied to the antero-lateral chest wall. The TTS-fentanyl systems remained in situ for 24 h and were then removed and a second lot of systems were applied to the contra-lateral chest wall. There was a mean (S.D.) delay time of 12.7 (9.6) h before minimum effective blood fentanyl concentrations (MEC) were obtained from the systems and pseudo-steady state was reached between 36 and 48 h. There was a decay time of 16.1 (7.1) h after the systems were removed for the blood fentanyl concentration to decrease to less than the mean MEC for the control of postoperative pain. There was marked variability between patients in the actual hourly fentanyl dose rate determined from the residual amount of fentanyl remaining in the system and the duration of application. Significantly more supplementary pethidine was administered for inadequate postoperative analgesia between 0 and 12 h compared to the 12-24, 24-36 and 36-48 h periods; this was consistent with the observed delay time. Three patients required a reduction in the hourly fentanyl dose rate because of bradypnoea while 1 patient required an increase in dose because of inadequate pain relief. Nausea was the most frequently reported side effect (85% of patients) while bradypnoea, drowsiness, unpleasant dreams and headache were also reported. These effects were due to the combined effects of a sustained blood fentanyl concentration and the intermittent supplementary pethidine doses. Side effects due to the topical formulation were transient and included erythema (8 patients) and a minor rash (2 patients) in the area occluded by the systems. The TTS-fentanyl systems provided a significant contribution to postoperative pain control but, at the TTS dose rates used, supplementary doses of pethidine were required by all patients probably to control 'incident' pain.\r"

The system classifies patients in stage 1 (good prognosis) to stage 3 (poor prognosis) according to the mechanism of pain, characteristics of pain, previous narcotic exposure, cognitive function, psychological distress, tolerance and past history of drug addiction or alcoholism. During day 1 patients were staged after being seen by one of the investigators. Patients were treated for 21 days, when a final diagnosis of pain control was made. Eighteen of 22 patients in stage 1 achieved good pain control (82%) vs. 2/22 patients in stage 3 (10%; P less than 0.01). Sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value of the system were 0.75, 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. We conclude that this is a simple and reliable system for clinical staging that can be used for clinical research and management of patients with cancer pain.\r"

It was suggested that it may be premature to adopt a literature based clustering method until the validity of empirically derived clusters has been more thoroughly determined. The utility of a given set of clusters may best be determined by using locally derived clusters to predict treatment response. Once the predictive validity of the local clusters has been demonstrated, the Costello approach may prove more useful.\r"

Forty percent reported 'obvious pain' (pain which affected them 'to quite a high degree' or more and was 'like being stiff after exercise' or worse) lasting more than 6 months. Pain problems of more than 6 months duration were reported far more often than short-lasting problems. Continuous or nearly continuous pain problems were reported as frequently as problems recurring regularly or irregularly. Pains in the neck, shoulders, arms, lower back and legs were most frequent. The prevalence of 'obvious pain' in these localizations was 15-20%. Pain was reported most frequently in the age group 45-64, where the prevalence of 'obvious pain' was 50% among males as well as females. Over 65 years of age the prevalence was less.\r"

This effect was not due to the drug's sedative effect, since locomotor activity was not lower in treated than untreated rats. Daily injections of normal saline also suppressed autotomy, but for a shorter period of time than amitriptyline. This effect was not apparent in diazepam-treated rats, suggesting that the saline injection delayed autotomy as a result of stress-induced anti-nociception. Since amitriptyline is effective in humans in alleviating certain chronic pain disorders, these results further corroborate the suggestion that autotomy is a model of chronic pain, sensitive to centrally acting analgesics and to some forms of stress.\r"

A nested case-control analysis was conducted within the Nurses' Health Study cohort to examine the relation between timing of severe sun exposure and incidence of melanoma. The subjects were 130 white women aged 38 to 65 years with confirmed cutaneous melanoma (other than acral lentigenous) who reported no history of melanoma in first-degree relatives. The control subjects were 300 women matched by race, date of birth, and cycle of questionnaire who also reported no history of melanoma in first-degree relatives. We used conditional logistic regression to evaluate the relation of sun damage after 30 years of age and sun damage from 15 to 20 years of age to the incidence of melanoma. Blistering sunburns between 15 to 20 years of age were associated with risk of melanoma (relative risk = 2.2 for five or more burns vs none, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.8). This association persisted when a history of burns after 30 years of age was controlled in the analysis. No material association was found between blistering sunburns after 30 years of age and melanoma. Similarly, a more equatorial latitude of residence between 15 and 20 years of age was positively associated with melanoma; latitude after 30 years of age was less strongly and not significantly related to melanoma risk. Sun exposure prior to 20 years of age is more closely associated with melanoma risk than sun exposure after 30 years of age.\r"

Fetal distress recorded with fetal monitoring and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were similar. The weight, length, and head circumference growth curves of the infants born to cocaine-using mothers were shifted below the 25th percentile. Microcephaly was present in 12 of 56 (21.4%) infants whose mothers used cocaine during pregnancy (X2 = 5.96, P less than .01), and 15 of 56 (26.7%) had intrauterine growth retardation (X2 = 9.53, P less than .01) compared with the control infants (2 of 5 [3.5%] and 3 of 56 [5.3%], respectively). There was no increase in teratogenicity. Neither narcotic withdrawal symptoms nor illness could distinguish the infants born of cocaine-using mothers from the control infants.

The cumulative incidence of needle injury among pediatric house officers in New York who completed at least 1 year of training was ascertained. A questionnaire designed to elicit retrospective information regarding needle injuries was completed by 294 house officers in medical school-affiliated pediatric training programs. A total of 205 (69.7%) had stuck themselves or been stuck with a needle contaminated with a patient's blood, and 48 (17%) reported a needle injury involving a needle contaminated with the blood of a patient with suspected HIV infection. Only 11 of the 48 had received counselling or HIV testing following their possible HIV exposure. These data indicate that needle injury among pediatric house officers in New York is common. Reducing occupational risk is an especially compelling policy issue for pediatric training programs in areas where HIV is endemic.\r"

Chronic hypoxemia, hypercarbia, bronchospasm, and inadequate nutrition were present in all. The movement disorder developed from approximately the third postnatal month. The dominant movements involve the limbs, neck, trunk, and oral-buccal-lingual structures. The limb movements were most prominent distally and consisted of rapid, random, jerky movements (similar to chorea) and \"restless\" movements (similar to akathisia). Similar movements of the neck and face were observed; tongue movements had a \"darting\" quality. The oral-buccal-lingual movements were similar to the dyskinesia of older patients. Movements were exacerbated during episodes of respiratory failure and attenuated during sleep. All infants exhibited feeding disorders, largely due to tongue movements. In 3 infants treated with clonazepam, there was striking improvement in motor function, including feeding. The natural history was partial or complete resolution or a static course. Thus, of the 7 surviving infants, the movements were absent (without therapy) at 15, 18, and 30 months of age. In the remaining 4 infants (3 of whom receive clonazepam), the movements, though attenuated, persisted at 6, 12, 15 and 21 months of age, respectively. Neuropathologically, 1 infant showed neuronal loss with astrocytosis in caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus. These data defined a previously unrecognized extrapyramidal movement disorder of infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia; pathogenesis may be related to chronic hypoxemia.\r"

  ".W": "During a 2-year prospective study of gastroenteritis in children less than 2 years of age, the role of enteric adenovirus as a cause of infantile diarrhea was examined in three clinical settings in a case-control fashion. Using a monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with specificity for adenovirus serotypes 40 and 41, enteric adenovirus was identified in 10 of 246 episodes of diarrhea in outpatients (4.1%), 13 of 211 children admitted to the hospital with diarrhea (6.2%), and 5 of 81 children in whom nosocomial diarrhea developed (6.2%), making this agent the third most commonly identified etiologic agent of diarrheal disease. Asymptomatic infections were uncommon (5 of 372 control subjects, or 1.3%) and were seen most frequently in the nosocomial setting. Cases occurred in every calendar month except March and April of each year. A syndrome of watery diarrhea of longer duration compared with other patients with diarrhea (mean 5.4 vs 3.8 days, P = .01), associated with vomiting and dehydration, was present in most cases. Compared with patients with rotavirus, patients were as likely to experience fever and dehydration and more likely to vomit. Household contact with gastroenteritis, often with a child 2 to 5 years of age, was a predisposing factor. It was concluded that enteric adenovirus is an important cause of infantile diarrhea in Baltimore children. Although far less common than rotavirus, this agent was associated with diarrheal illnesses that were at least as severe as those seen with rotavirus.\r"

The reliability of this technique in detecting hyperoxemia is controversial, because small changes in saturation greater than 90% are associated with relatively large changes in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2). The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of pulse oximetry using an alarm limit of 95% tcSO2 in detecting hyperoxemia (defined as PaO2 greater than 90 mm Hg) and to examine the effect of varying the alarm limit on reliability. Two types of pulse oximeter were studied alternately in 50 newborn infants who were mechanically ventilated with indwelling arterial lines. Three arterial blood samples were drawn from every infant during routine increase of inspired oxygen before intratracheal suction, and PaO2 was compared with tcSO2. The Nellcor N-100 pulse oximeter identified all 26 hyperoxemic instances correctly (sensitivity 100%) and alarmed falsely in 25 of 49 nonhyperoxemic instances (specificity 49%). The Ohmeda Biox 3700 pulse oximeter detected 13 of 35 hyperoxemic instances (sensitivity 37%) and alarmed falsely in 7 of 40 nonhyperoxemic instances (specificity 83%). The optimal alarm limit, defined as a sensitivity of 95% or more associated with maximal specificity, was determined for Nellcor N-100 at 96% tcSO2 (specificity 38%) and for Ohmeda Biox 3700 at 89% tcSO2 (specificity 52%). It was concluded that pulse oximeters can be highly sensitive in detecting hyperoxemia provided that type-specific alarm limits are set and a low specificity is accepted.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between infant pediatric care use in the first year of life and the quality of mother-infant attachment at 1-year of age was examined. Fifty-six mother and infant pairs were classified by the Ainsworth Strange Situation procedure as securely (n = 17) or anxiously attached (n = 39). Pediatric records for the first 12 months of life were reviewed for frequency and type of visit, diagnoses, treatment, and symptoms prompting the care visit. Anxiously attached infants used acute care services (walk-in and emergency room) significantly earlier and more often than infants with a secure attachment. Use of acute care services began at a mean age of 3.8 months for the anxiously attached infants compared with 6.5 months for the securely attached. Differences in utilization persisted through the year. Mean acute care use in the anxiously attached infants was 3.6 visits compared with 1.9 visits for the securely attached. Acute care use was associated with a variety of common infant illnesses in both groups. In contrast, there was no difference in the use of well-baby care (mean 6 visits). Utilization and attachment status were independent of birth or prenatal difficulties. High cumulative use of pediatric care during the first year of life may identify infant and mother pairs who are experiencing strain in their interactions and relationship. Early recognition would provide an opportunity for comprehensive assessment and preventive intervention in the pediatric setting.\r"

All were examined within 1 to 6 hours of ingestion and all were asymptomatic. Estimated dose ingested in 10 patients ranged from 1.5 to 8.8 mg (0.1 to 0.73 mg/kg). Three patients with initial T4 serum concentrations greater than 75 micrograms/dL manifested signs of toxicity within 12 to 48 hours (fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and/or agitation) that resolved within 24 to 60 hours. The mean elimination half-life of T4 in 7 patients with multiple serum concentrations was 2.8 +/- 0.4 days, whereas the mean elimination half-life of triiodothyronine was 6 +/- 1.7 days. It was concluded that (1) the majority of acute pediatric T4 overdoses are not severe and may be managed on an outpatient basis, (2) the absence of early clinical manifestations does not preclude delayed onset of toxicity that may be better predicted by initial T4 concentrations, and (3) the elimination half-life of T4 is shorter and the elimination half-life of tri-iodothyronine is longer than with therapeutic doses.\r"

These defects were neural tube defects (575 patients), oral clefts (633 patients), omphalocele (141 patients), esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (88 patients), imperforate anus (151 patients), conotruncal heart defects (289 patients), and diaphragmatic hernia (75 patients). Known syndromes were excluded from the analysis. Of 1743 infants with at least one midline defect, 86 (4.9%) had at least a second midline defect, and 9 (0.5%) had two additional midline defects. Pairwise analysis of the seven defects shows that, although most midline defects tend to be statistically associated with other midline defects, specific combinations of midline defects are seen. For example, neural tube defects are more strongly associated with cleft lip with or without cleft palate than with cleft palate alone; imperforate anus is more strongly associated with spina bifida than with anencephaly or encephalocele. Moreover, some combinations of defects are not observed (eg, neural tube defect and conotruncal heart defect, clefts and diaphragmatic hernia, omphalocele and esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula). These data point to the need for further refinement in the study of the association of midline defects in terms of embryologic and pathogenetic mechanisms because most midline defects tend to occur as an isolated defect, some midline defects occur with nonmidline defects (such as limb defects), and specific associations among midline defects are observed.\r"

There were no major complications during axillary artery monitoring. After decannulation, systolic blood pressure did not differ between arms.

Pain intensity was scored by the children themselves, using a visual analogue scale in which 0 corresponded to absence of sensation and 10 to the worst imaginable painful sensation. Venipunctures were performed on 18 children (6.1 to 12.2 years of age) equally divided in the study and control groups; EMLA cream was associated with lesser pain scores than those with placebo (means +/- SD: 2.8 +/- 2.4 vs 6.8 +/- 2.1, P less than .01). A crossover trial was used in the studies of subcutaneous drug reservoir and lumbar punctures, eight children (6.1 to 15.1 years of age) were tested for subcutaneous drug reservoir punctures; pain induced by this procedure was rated at 3.9 +/- 2.2 with placebo compared with 1.2 +/- 1.8 with EMLA cream (P less than .04). In lumbar punctures (14 children studied, 5.5 to 15.3 years of age), EMLA cream was again associated with less pain (1.9 +/- 1.9) than was placebo (5.6 +/- 3.0, P less than .01). It was concluded that the use of EMLA cream substantially reduces pain caused by venous, subcutaneous drug reservoir, and lumbar punctures in children and may therefore be offered to young patients, particularly those repeatedly submitted to such procedures.\r"

To determine whether this pattern persisted in a group presumably at higher than usual risk of infant death, patterns of mortality among infants weighing 1500 to 2499 g at birth and born in Alabama between 1980 and 1983 were examined by race, residence, and cause of death. Neonatal and infant mortality rates were higher for black infants; postneonatal mortality rates were higher for black infants. Neonatal mortality was highest for white infants from the rural part of the state; post-neonatal mortality was highest for black infants from the rural part of the state. There was little variation in the proportion of preventable postneonatal deaths by race or residence (17.6% for all) but almost twice as many white deaths were not preventable as black ones (39.0 vs 21.9%). It is posited that rural residence may actually be a surrogate measure for lack of access to health services.\r"

  ".W": "Infant mortality rates in the United States are higher than in any other developed country. Low birth weight (LBW) is the primary determinant of infant mortality. Despite city, state, and federal programs to prevent LBW, decreases in infant mortality in the 1980s appear to be largely secondary to improved survival of LBW infants rather than to a decline in the rate of LBW births. Because prevention of mortality due to infectious disease is feasible, it was of interest to examine the role of infectious diseases in LBW infant mortality. US vital statistics mortality data for 1968 through 1982 were analyzed in terms of LBW infant mortality associated with infectious and noninfectious diseases. These analyses indicated that the rates of infectious disease-associated early neonatal and postneonatal LBW mortality increased during this time; late neonatal rates did not decline appreciably. Infectious diseases were associated with 4% of all LBW infant deaths in 1968; this had increased to 10% by 1982. Although LBW infant mortality rates associated with noninfectious diseases did not differ for white and black populations, infectious disease-associated mortality rates were consistently higher for blacks than whites in both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. Chorioamnionitis was involved in 28% of infectious disease-associated early neonatal LBW deaths. Sepsis was an increasingly listed cause of death in all infant age periods, whereas respiratory tract infections were decreasingly listed. Necrotizing enterocolitis increased as a cause of late neonatal mortality. These data suggest that infectious diseases are an increasing cause of LBW infant mortality and these deaths occur more frequently in the black population targeted by prevention programs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eight animals were assigned to each of four positive pressure ventilation groups at \"low\" settings (an FiO2 of 0.25, a frequency of 10 breaths per minute, a peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cm H2O, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 4 cm H2O, a flow rate of 10 L/min, and an inspiratory time to expiratory time ratio of 1:2): (1) positive pressure ventilation with no hypotension or hypoxemia; (2) positive pressure ventilation with hypotension; (3) positive pressure ventilation with hypoxemia; and (4) positive pressure ventilation with both hypotension and hypoxemia. In addition, eight piglets were assigned to each of two positive pressure ventilation groups at \"high\" settings (greater frequency [40 breaths per minute], higher peak inspiratory pressure [40 cm H2O], and greater flow rate [17 L/min]): (1) positive pressure ventilation with no hypotension or hypoxemia; and (2) positive pressure ventilation with both hypotension and hypoxemia. The changes were mild and similar among the first three positive pressure groups at low settings. However, the injury scores of the combined hypotension and hypoxemia group (group 4) were greater than those of the former three positive pressure ventilation groups (P less than .004). The piglets receiving positive pressure ventilation at high settings with no hypotension or hypoxemia (group 5) had no more injury than those in the first three groups receiving positive pressure ventilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Life-threatening rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria may follow any infection associated with decreased intake. If carnitine palmityl transferase deficiency is diagnosed in a proband, other siblings should be evaluated so that proper preventative measures can be undertaken to help prevent the development of symptoms in susceptible individuals who have not been recognized to have the disease.\r"

Of 70,336 newborns screened, 142 (0.20%) met the criteria for clinical follow up. Of these, one child was confirmed to have classical galactosemia and nine children were found to be Duarte/galactosemia genetic compounds.

Misuse of car seats and anatomic and biomechanical factors in the cervical spines of infants and young children appear to have contributed to the occurrence of these previously rare injuries. Like seat belts, car safety seats are now a factor in child passenger injury characteristics, and therefore, car safety seat design merits reevaluation. In light of this development, public and parent education by health care professionals concerning the correct use of car safety seats is necessary.\r"

These data document the wide variation in pressures generated with the pneumatic otoscope and suggest that the feasibility of modifying this instrument into a standardized, objective pneumatic system should be explored.\r"

  ".W": "A study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of family history factors as screening criteria for childhood hypercholesterolemia. When they were seen for routine care at one of eight office practices, 1005 prepubertal children underwent random serum cholesterol determinations. Parental and grandparental histories of cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerotic complications prior to 55 years of age were also obtained. Of the initial group, 274 children had total cholesterol levels greater than or equal to 175 mg/dL, and 175 of these children returned for retesting after an overnight fast. A total of 88 children were found to have low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) values greater than or equal to 90th percentile for age and sex. Maternal and paternal histories of hypercholesterolemia were significantly associated with elevated LDL-C (odds ratio = 7.3 and 2.9, respectively), but had extremely low sensitivities (0.09, 0.15) despite modest positive predictive values (0.42, 0.22). Grandparental histories of sudden death, peripheral vascular disease, and gout were associated with elevated LDL-C, but sensitivities and positive predictive values for all of these factors were less than 0.22. Family history factors most commonly recommended as criteria for cholesterol screening in children did not identify half of all the children with elevated LDL-C and did not selectively identify the most severely affected children. Adding information concerning the presence of childhood obesity did not result in appreciable improvement in LDL-C detection beyond that achieved by family history factors alone. It was concluded that if thorough identification of young children with elevated LDL-C is desired, inclusive population screening rather than a family history-based strategy would be the most effective approach.\r"

In clinical research, this selective suppression of \"negative\" results may lead to the adoption of ineffective or hazardous treatments. In an attempt to obtain information about unpublished trials in perinatal medicine, letters were sent to 42,000 obstetricians and pediatricians in 18 countries. As a result, we were notified of 395 unpublished randomized trials. Only 18 of the trials had been completed more than 2 years before the survey, a period during which at least 2300 reports of perinatal trials had been published. Of the 395 unpublished trials, 125 had ceased recruitment within the 2 years prior to the survey, 193 were actively recruiting at the time of the survey, and 59 were about to begin recruitment. It was concluded that publication bias will not be addressed successfully by attempts to obtain information about unpublished trials retrospectively. However, since the response rate to our request for details about ongoing and planned trials was good, prospective registration of trials at inception appears to be a feasible approach to reducing publication bias and its adverse consequences. An additional merit of prospective registration of clinical trials is that it should reduce unnecessary duplication (as opposed to necessary replication) in research and promote more effective collaboration.\r"

Outcome variables included various pregnancy complications, birth weights, and gestational ages. The predictor variables were usually not significant for the full sample. For black women, social support from the woman's partner or mother accounted for 33% of the variance in gestation complications and 14% of the variance in prolonged labor or cesarean section complications. For white women, high rather than low social support was significant in accounting for pregnancy outcomes and substance use, indicating the the social network might reinforce negative health practices for this group. None of the predictor variables were found to be statistically significant for the group of Hispanic women, who had very low complication rates.\r"

A qualitative approach was used to gather the data in unstructured interviews. Content analysis was used to classify data. Sources of illness and remedies identified by the women were divided into two categories: natural and supernatural. Natural sources included cold, impurities, diet, weakness, lack of moderation, and stress. Supernatural sources included illnesses allowed by God, witchcraft, and evil influences. Remedies included antidotes, food, medicines, prayer, and healing. Analysis of the relationship of AIDS to traditional beliefs revealed that AIDS had been integrated into the traditional conceptualization of illness, health practices, and healing, and was attributed to both natural and supernatural causes. Prevention, prayer, and spiritual healing were recommended as remedies. Implications were that AIDS education, prevention, and treatment programs be within the context of traditional belief system.\r"

Data were collected from 510 pregnant women and from their prenatal, hospital, and infants' health records. Despite a common assumption in the prenatal literature that weight gain during pregnancy reflects nutritional adequacy, nutrition and weight gain were only weakly related in this sample. Further, nutritional balance did not significantly contribute to additional explained variance in mother's weight gain when gestation, body mass index, and edema were controlled. Moreover, it was weight gain, not nutrition, that contributed to variance in baby's birth weight. These results suggest that while weight gain during pregnancy influences fetal outcomes, weight gain may not be a valid measure of nutrition.\r"

Total MFAS and subscales scores, except Giving of Self, increased significantly as gestation progressed. There were also significant time x subject interaction effects for total MFAS and all subscale scores. MFAS scores were unrelated to most maternal demographic variables, but parity was negatively related to the MFAS score increase across gestation.

Subjects were videotaped during the interaction period. Analyses of cardiovascular responses controlled for preinteraction values revealed that all measures were significantly higher during interaction than during the postinteraction period. The frequency of fathers' verbal behaviors was negatively related to SBP and positively related to HR during interaction. Frequency of infant crying was positively related to fathers' DBP both during interaction and in the postinteraction period. Fathers appeared highly sensitive to the stimuli of interacting with their newborns and responded in a complex manner to infant signals.

Caregivers seem to have been stimulated to evaluate and change their appraisals of their care-giving situation and, at times, their use of external resources and patient management strategies. We speculate that the predominant way subjects were influenced was through the opportunity to examine their experience relative to that of other caregivers as they completed the study instruments. Although it is possible that the effect was related to the specific behavior of the data collectors, we are reasonably confident that the structured interviewer training methods minimized this effect. Direct comments about interviewers were rare in responses to open-ended questions, and requests for information or help from interviewers were relatively infrequent, lending further support to the idea that interviewer effects were not a major influence on subjects. Although Rubin and Mitchell (1978) aptly described the unintended effect of study participation on their respondents, which was akin to counseling, little attention has been paid to this phenomenon in recent years. What family caregivers experienced as participants in our study, but failed to experience in their social network or formal contacts with the health care system, was an opportunity to: (a) examine their experience as a caregiver in depth, (b) anticipate what the future might hold for them, and (c) compare their personal experience to the experience of other families providing care to elderly members.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sympathetic amines, while less commonly involved in pediatric poisonings, deserve special attention because of their potent cardiovascular side effects, eg, tachycardia and hypertension. Tetrahydrozoline, the active ingredient in several nasal and ophthalmologic over-the-counter medications, has previously been implicated in childhood ingestions. We report a case of tetrahydrozoline ingestion in which, paradoxically, lethargy, bradycardia, and hypotension were noted.\r"

The glue was placed on the blunt end of a cotton swab, which was then introduced into the canal to make contact with the bean. Removal was easy, safe, and effective. This procedure avoided the morbidity associated with many well known techniques, eg, the use of forceps, and may have prevented removal under general anesthesia.\r"

The most frequent diagnoses in the syncopal patients were vasovagal syncope (50%), orthostatic hypotension (20%), atypical seizure (7.5%), migraine headache (5%), and minor head trauma (5%). The most frequent diagnoses in the near-syncope group were lightheadedness (29%), seizure (18%), tension headache (12%), and migraine (6%). Seventeen and one half percent of syncopal patients had abnormalities of vital signs, orthostatic vital signs, glucose, hematocrit, or ECG; none of the near-syncopal patients had abnormalities. We conclude that initial evaluation of first-episode syncope should include orthostatic vital signs, glucose, hematocrit, and ECG with further studies performed as clinically indicated.\r"

Over a three-month period, 72 patients (43 male, 29 female) with a mean age of 4.4 (SD +/- 3.9) years were studied. In addition to verbal explanations for all parents, 38 parents received written instructions. Each group remembered 4/7 (57%) of signs and symptoms and was equally satisfied with verbal explanations. The majority (84%) of parents who received instruction sheets intended to keep these for further reference. Low recall of two instructions may be due to poor comprehension of the language used. We conclude that written instructions (1) did not add significantly to recall, (2) may provide reassurance to parents, and (3) need to be written in simple lay terms in order to be understood by the parents/patients served.\r"

During the seven-month study period there were 2161 admissions, but only 466 protocols completed (21.5%). We excluded 143 forms because of errors in completion. The remaining 323 forms were analyzed for educational level of the physicians, topics omitted, patient diagnosis, and physician's rating of parent sophistication. Compliance in discussing each topic ranged from 77 to 93%. Attending physicians discussed all topics less than trainee physicians. All physicians discussed guilt feelings least (P less than 0.001). Guilt was discussed 55 and 62% of the time when the diagnosis was poisoning or chronic disease, respectively. Topics discussed were unrelated to parental sophistication. This protocol was unhelpful in improving communication.\r"

Of 18 neonates with bacterial meningitis, all had a radio lower than one; of 54 neonates with aseptic or viral meningitis, 46 (85%) had a ratio greater than one. The difference between mean ratio values of the two groups was highly significant (P less than 0.001). A CBC differential ratio less than one was more sensitive (100%) in initially identifying neonates with bacterial meningitis than were other traditionally utilized parameters, eg, presence of fever (50%), ill appearance (50%), hypoglycorrhachia (61%), elevated CSF protein (55%), or CSF Gram-stained smear revealing pathogenic organisms (45%). Statistical analysis revealed that a CBC differential ratio less than 1.5 will accurately predict all cases of neonatal bacterial meningitis with a confidence of 99.95%. The CBC differential ratio is an accurate index for distinguishing neonates with bacterial meningitis from those with nonbacterial meningitis. Utilization of this parameter in conjunction with other traditional factors is efficacious in predicting outcome.\r"

It was shown that specific training demands, such as the number of beeper calls, the number of nights on call, the amount of sleep, etc., correlated with the POMS and the SDS only in the early rotations. The residents' ratings of commitment to teaching, availability, and sensitivity of the faculty on each service, however, were consistently related to the residents' moods regardless of time of year. When residents rated faculty as low on these characteristics, they scored higher on the stress indicators, whereas when residents rated faculty as high on these characteristics, their stress scores were significantly reduced.\r"

Significant cycles were found in total visits and most diagnostic categories, with cycles longer than four months being the most prominent. Physician availability was highly correlated with variations in all visit categories tested, including injury visits. However, little variation was found in the use of referral. These findings may have implications for medical training, epidemiologic surveillance, and health resource planning. This method should be considered to be a standard technique for study of time-related variables.\r"

Independent physician reviewers determined that 59 (9 percent) of the admissions were potentially preventable; 40 were due to iatrogenic factors including inadequate follow-up and adverse drug reactions, 12 were due to lack of patient compliance, and seven were due to both iatrogenesis and noncompliance. Adverse drug reactions were the most common cause of iatrogenesis, and warfarin was the drug that most commonly caused an adverse reaction. Inadequate follow-up of abnormal physical findings, symptoms, and laboratory test results was also important. Patients with preventable admissions had more medical diagnoses (4.9 versus 4.1, p less than 0.01), were prescribed more medications (4.5 versus 3.7, p less than 0.01), and were older (66.5 years versus 60.2 years, p less than 0.01) than patients whose admissions were not preventable. It is concluded that a small percentage of emergency hospitalizations may be preventable and that systematic review of emergency hospitalizations may provide a means of measuring the quality of primary medical care.\r"

Sudden deaths were further divided into three subgroups according to the interval from the onset of symptoms to death: (less than one hour; one to six hours; more than six hours).

Patients with secondary plasma cell leukemia were older, had a greater incidence of lytic bone lesions, had a lower platelet count, and had a larger M-protein in the serum than did patients with primary plasma cell leukemia. The median survival was 6.8 months for patients with primary plasma cell leukemia and 1.3 months for patients with secondary plasma cell leukemia. In patients with primary plasma cell leukemia, multiple alkylating agents produced a higher response rate than did melphalan, but the median time from treatment to progression or death was not significantly improved with such therapy. Review of the literature also suggests that the response rate is higher with combination chemotherapy than with single alkylating agents. Patients with secondary plasma cell leukemia usually show resistance to any type of chemotherapy and have a short survival.\r"

Thirty-nine patients were under 60 years of age, and 34 were 60 years or older. The clinical and histologic characteristics of the two groups were similar. Using either univariate or multivariate analysis, age appeared as the only prognostic factor. Patients under 60 had a median survival of 48 months, with a five-year survival rate of 47 percent and a five-year disease-free survival rate for complete-remission patients of 72 percent. Patients 60 years or older had a median survival of 18 months with a five-year survival rate of 18 percent and a five-year disease-free survival rate for complete-remission patients of 24 percent. These highly significant differences were related to a non-significantly decreased complete-remission rate and a significantly higher relapse rate in elderly patients. Since patient selection according to age could play a role in the results achieved with intensive chemotherapy programs, randomized trials comparing the various chemotherapy programs for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Visual and auditory neurotoxicity was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion-dependent anemia who were receiving iron chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous deferoxamine. Twenty-two patients in the affected group had abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4,000 to 8,000 Hz and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels. When deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed, audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks, and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic. Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability. Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality, and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated. Auditory deterioration and improvement, demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine, respectively, provided convincing evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity. Based on these data, a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine. A dose of 50 mg/kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities. With mild toxicity, a reduction to 30 or 40 mg/kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks. Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg/kg per dose with careful monitoring. In those with symptoms of hearing loss, the drug should be stopped for four weeks, and when the audiogram is stable or improved, therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg/kg per dose. Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci have become increasingly responsible for febrile episodes in cancer patients, often necessitating the addition of vancomycin to an aminoglycoside-containing broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen. A total of 229 courses of antibiotic therapy in 229 patients were evaluated for nephrotoxicity associated with the administration of an aminoglycoside and/or vancomycin. The incidence of nephrotoxicity observed in patients administered an aminoglycoside (Group A) was 18 percent; vancomycin (Group B) 15 percent; and an aminoglycoside concurrently with vancomycin (Group C) 15 percent. The following pharmacokinetic/dosing factors were significantly associated with increased nephrotoxicity in the groups: baseline serum creatinine level, mean daily dose during the first three days of therapy (Group B), and elevated serum trough aminoglycoside or vancomycin concentrations (2 micrograms/ml or more or 10 micrograms/ml or more, respectively). No cumulative nephrotoxicity was demonstrated with the concurrent administration of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside. A higher incidence of nephrotoxicity was seen in Group C (42 percent) and Group B (27 percent) patients, in whom trough serum vancomycin concentrations were 10 micrograms/ml or more.\r"

  ".U": "89023154\r", 
  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of nifedipine following intravenous administration can be represented by an open two-compartment model with a terminal elimination half-life of about two hours. Nifedipine is extensively biotransformed to inactive metabolites, and the total body clearance (450 to 700 ml/minute) is primarily due to hepatic metabolism. Nifedipine undergoes significant tissue distribution in that the steady-state volume of distribution (0.62 to 0.77 liter/kg) is more than twice the volume of distribution of the central compartment (0.25 to 0.29 liter/kg). Although nifedipine is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, oral bioavailability ranges from 45 to 68 percent because of first-pass metabolism. Nifedipine given three times daily shows no accumulation in plasma and no changes in pharmacokinetic behavior during a one-week study period. Pharmacokinetic studies on the gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) show that the bioavailability of the GITS dosage form (relative to the capsule) is about 65 percent after a single dose, but increases to about 86 percent at steady-state because of residual absorption more than 24 hours after dosing. Linear pharmacokinetics are seen following administration of single oral doses of nifedipine GITS as indicated by dose-proportional increases in the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve over the range of 30 to 180 mg. Administration of the GITS dosage form in the presence of food slightly increases the rate of drug absorption, but does not influence the extent of drug bioavailability. Dose-dumping has not been observed, even with dosing after a meal containing a high level of fat. The GITS tablets provide zero-order delivery of nifedipine, and drug absorption persists beyond the dosing interval of 24 hours. Thus, the GITS dosage form will permit once-a-day dosing and maintain the desired, constant plasma drug concentration with minimal fluctuation.\r"

  ".W": "Convenient once-a-day dosage regimens are highly desirable in general, and especially for the treatment of asymptomatic diseases such as essential hypertension. Nifedipine is an insoluble, short-acting calcium channel blocker that presents a difficult technical challenge for formulation in a constant 24-hour delivery dosage form. Once-a-day dosage forms have been developed based on the gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) push-pull osmotic pump configuration in three strengths with different drug delivery rates (mg/hour) per dose (mg), as 1.7/30, 3.4/60, and 5.1/90. The delivery rates of drug from these systems are controlled by their drug loading, composition of osmotic components, membrane properties, and dimensions. The release rates are independent of pH in the range from gastric pH = 1.2 to intestinal pH = 7.5. The release rates are independent of stirring rate and therefore unlikely to be influenced by motility in the gastrointestinal tract. The drug release rate from the nifedipine GITS dosage form in vivo in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs has been found to be equal to the release rate in vitro, indicating that the in vitro test is predictive of in vivo delivery. Following administration of the nifedipine GITS dosage forms to human subjects, absorption rates, calculated from resulting plasma concentrations, indicate that the cumulative amount of drug absorbed in humans over 24 hours is proportional to the amounts of drug delivered in vitro. Plasma concentrations are therefore predictable and remain relatively constant throughout the 24-hour dosing interval.\r"

The most common use of this procedure is to augment an already planned resection or recession procedure so that it can be performed monocularly to reduce an accompanying hypertropia or hypotropia or to collapse the A or V pattern when horizontal surgery is being performed for estropia or exotropia. In transfer procedures, the resultant change of deviation and cosmetic improvement is good or excellent in almost all cases. Some special transfer procedures, such as the Harada-Ito or the Jensen operation, can have dramatic effects on both comfort and change of symptoms for the patient.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 405 patients with thyroid cancer treated by surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy from February 1958 through 1979 is reported. The immediate evaluation of the operation was that it was either incomplete or complete. Incomplete surgery implied that there was (1) possible residual tumor in the operative field, the result of difficult dissection of the tumor off the neighboring organs or tissues, as assessed by the surgeon; (2) multiple (more than five) lymph nodes involved; (3) positive border of the removed lesions; or (4) microscopic evidence of tumor in the operative field. Complete surgery implied through extirpation of cancer grossly and microscopically. In 297 patients who had complete surgery, 238 patients treated by surgery alone had a 5-year survival rate of 92% (218/238), while 59 patients who received postoperative radiotherapy had a 5-year survival rate of 78% (46/59). The optimum dose of postoperative radiotherapy was 50-70 Gy in 5 to 8 weeks, with the spinal dose kept under 40 Gy. Our experience shows that postoperative radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients who had had complete surgery. Yet, in 108 patients who had incomplete surgery, surgery alone yielded a 5-year survival rate of 33% (19/57), while surgery plus radiotherapy yielded a 5-year survival of 71% (36/51). Our observation shows a remarkable benefit with postoperative radiotherapy in patients who have had incomplete surgery (P less than 0.05). According to pathologic criteria, postoperative radiotherapy was more effective in well-differentiated cancers than in poorly differentiated ones. It was equally effective in untreated as well as recurrent lesions. The prognosis for younger patients was better, but the sex of the patients did not affect prognosis.\r"

Downward or upward projection of the orbital plate of the frontal bone can cause exophthalmos or enophthalmos. Cerebrospinal fluid leak, with or without meningitis, and seizures can also be part of the syndrome. Effective treatment consists of repairing or obliterating the frontal sinus, reducing the orbital root fracture, and repositioning the globe. Rib or iliac crest grafts, acrylic implants, and temporalis muscle-galea flaps are useful in correcting the deformity and restoring appropriate function. Long-term follow-up examinations are an important part of patient care.\r"

Sixty-seven percent of patients had soft tissue deformities of the midface, and 13% had soft tissue deformities of the lower face.

Indices of tumor progression or regression included both size and contrast enhancement characteristics. Twenty of 25 patients followed during this period received radiotherapy. Of these patients, ten had tumor regression, nine were stable, and one was worse. This result contrasts with five untreated patients, four of whom had tumor progression and one who was stable (x2 = 18.37, p less than .001). One of the children with tumor progression later received radiotherapy and demonstrated marked tumor regression. Of the 18 treated patients who could be tested reliably, visual function and/or regression occurred in seven children. None of the untreated patients improved. There were no definite complications of radiotherapy in this small group.\r"

At 5 years of age, he was evaluated because of recurrent tonic seizures. He had growth retardation, microcephaly, quadriplegia, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Muscle strength was difficult to assess because of multiple joint contractures. Deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive. Laboratory data indicated rachitic changes on x-ray, hypocalcemia, low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH-D) and 1-alpha-25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1-alpha-25-[OH]2-D) levels, a normal response to the Ellsworth-Howard test, and markedly increased CK. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocities were normal. The patient responded to 1-alpha-OH-D treatment with increased serum calcium and normal CK activity; a significant correlation (p less than 0.01) was observed between calcium and log CK. The clinical course and laboratory findings supported the hypothesis that the increased CK was due to hypocalcemia, which in turn was due to the vitamin D deficiency in the severely handicapped child with malnutrition.\r"

Although serum contained high creatine kinase brain isoenzyme activity (CK-BB), CK-BB activity was not detected on repeated cerebrospinal fluid examinations. After frequent blood transfusions and steroid therapy, hematologic involvement improved gradually and disappeared finally at age 11 months; serum CK-BB tended to show a concomitant proportional increase in activity. A 111Indium chloride scan was performed at age 4 weeks when the patient had relatively low serum CK-BB activity. It indicated active extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen. The second scan was performed at age 12 months when she had high serum CK-BB activity and indicated active medullary hematopoiesis in the cranium. The tests disclosed that the elevated serum CK-BB activity was the result of bone marrow serum leakage, and not leakage from brain tissue. This finding may be a good marker of medullary hematopoietic activity in patients with osteopetrosis. Meanwhile, biopsied sural nerve revealed storage of cellular debris, including myelin figures in the Schwann cells, which suggested increased degradation process in the cells or lysosomal enzyme deficiency.\r"

Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a dilated myocardiopathy and poor left ventricular contractility. Biopsies of both ventricles revealed striking hydropic degeneration and fibrosis. Right triceps biopsy disclosed centronuclear myopathy. Because the spectrum of disease expression in centronuclear myopathy is extensive, an association with cardiac disease always should be considered in these patients.

Of the 50 patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores less than 7 upon admission, only 3 had SEPs within the normal range, while 37 had unilaterally or bilaterally absent SEPs. None of the 27 who died had normal SEPs; 1 had increased interpeak latencies, 26 had more abnormal SEPs. The 14 with normal outcomes had normal (9 patients) or delayed (4 patients) SEPs; the latter group returned to normal within a few days. Repeat SEP studies were performed in 33 patients. SEPs were relatively stable during the intensive care observation, with the exception of 6 patients with Reye syndrome. Subsequent studies are recommended in all patients, but are essential in those with Reye syndrome in order to be useful prognostically. The utility of SEPs did not vary as a function of coma etiology. These data support the usefulness of SEPs in early prediction of neurologic outcome in comatose children.\r"

At times customized accessing was needed which required specific adaptive modifications. Implementation of the AAC aids system was determined effective for DMD patients in view of the intellect-sparing nature of the disorder. Improvement was hampered by the progressive nature of the disease and by the emotional stress of accepting the long-term use of AAC. Correct and early diagnosis of communication impediments are crucial for the appropriate AAC aids prescription and implementation. An AAC protocol is suggested to meet the special communication needs of DMD patients.\r"

Subsequent examinations at age 12 months to 9 years demonstrated 4 children with spastic hemiparesis, and 3 children with normal neurologic examinations.

The surgically treated patients were sicker at presentation, and of the 9 patients requiring surgical intervention, 4 had neurologic sequelae and 1 patient died. Brain abscess aspiration or excision revealed organisms in 7 of the 9 surgically treated patients.

  ".W": "Neuronal cortical cell cultures obtained from fetal mice were subjected to increasing concentrations of sodium cyanide (10-500 microM) for 6 days in order to simulate prolonged partial asphyxia. Various neurochemical assays were performed to determine if certain cell types were preferentially more affected. Choline acetyltransferase activity was reduced significantly from control values at cyanide concentrations greater than 100 microM; there were similar reductions on a percentage basis in high-affinity uptake of beta-alanine and GABA and in clonazepam-displaceable benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding which reflected the neuronal BDZ receptor population. Ro5-4864-displaceable BDZ binding, a nonneuronal marker, was increased significantly. More modest reductions were apparent in specific BDZ binding and in protein content. Although a particular vulnerability of a specific cell type was not demonstrated, there was more neurochemical than morphologic evidence of cellular dysfunction. Co-exposure of the cultures to magnesium along with the highest concentrations of cyanide substantially prevented both neurochemical and morphologic abnormalities. These results lend further support to the concept that excitatory neurotransmitters may be implicated in the neuronal damage produced by hypoxia.\r"

Therefore, we studied 25 neonates with at least one electroencephalographic study prior to death and subsequent neuropathologic examination. Twenty-three estimates (92%) of gestational age in weeks, which were based on specific electrical patterns, agreed with sulcal-gyral development (e.g., the delineation of inferior frontal, superior temporal, calcarine sulci, and cytoarchitecture in various brain regions). Clinical (Ballard score) criteria and anatomic estimations of gestational age agreed in 18 of 24 patients (74%). Electroencephalographic estimates were significantly better than clinical estimates (p less than .05) for sick neonates who were less than or equal to 30 weeks gestational age.\r"

An abnormal auditory brainstem evoked response predicted neurologic deficits at age 1 year; however, a normal result did not predict a normal outcome. In order to evaluate the prognostic utility of examining other sensory pathways, somatosensory evoked responses were elicited following median nerve stimulation. Testing was performed at 37-44 weeks conceptional age (defined as gestational age plus chronologic age) and at 2 and 6 months conceptional ages. Those patients studied included 34 high-risk neonates and 18 healthy, term infants as controls. Ten of the 34 patients had abnormal somatosensory evoked responses. Abnormalities included increased absolute (N19, P22) and interwave (N13-N19, N19-P22) latencies and flat potentials, alone or in combination. Three children with flat potentials demonstrated a persistence of this abnormality on subsequent examination and they later presented clinically with spastic quadriparesis. Four infants with increased latencies manifested normal responses on subsequent examination. Recently, these 4 patients exhibited tone abnormalities and mild developmental deficits; developmental outcome, however, will be assessed in a blind study at 1 year of age as part of this ongoing prospective study. Preliminary results suggest that somatosensory evoked responses may be valuable as an electrophysiologic predictor of outcome.\r"

This discrepancy may be due to age differences at biopsy; our patients were biopsied at the ages of 7 and 6 years, while those patients reported previously were 10 years of age or older.

Mechanisms of central integration may be abnormal but the association with neural crest maldevelopment implicates the peripheral nervous system.\r"

Several epidemiologic factors have been identified and a reporting system established so that prevention programs can be monitored. It is hoped that greater awareness of the risk factors among players, coaches, leagues, referees, and parents will be an effective prophylactic measure in itself. Prevention must involve several approaches by hockey organizations and leagues, players, equipment manufacturers, and health care professionals and researchers.\r"

Specifically, these lesions appear unique with regard to infrequency of bony fracture, difficulty in effecting and maintaining reduction, and their more favorable response to early aggressive treatment. It is the authors' belief that these lesions resulting from athletic activity are due to axial loading.\r"

The decade from 1965 through 1974 was responsible for the greatest number and percentage of head and cervical spine fatalities, and the decade from 1975 through 1984 was associated with the smallest number and percentage. The data reveal that the majority of head and cervical spine fatalities are related to high-school football players either tackling or being tackled in a game. The majority of head fatalities are subdural hematomas, and almost all of the cervical spine fatalities are fractures, dislocations, or fracture-dislocations. There has been a dramatic reduction in these types of fatalities during the last decade, 1975 through 1984, and the preventive measures that have received most of the credit have been the 1976 rule change that prohibits initial contact with the head and face when blocking and tackling, the NOCSAE helmet standard that went into effect in colleges in 1978 and high schools in 1980, better coaching in the techniques of blocking and tackling, and improved medical care. There has been a reduction of head and cervical spine fatalities, but the analysis of data for the next decade, 1985 through 1994, will reveal the effects of the preventive measures discussed and continued research efforts.\r"

Players from 10 University football teams were monitored up to 4 years, and a brief neuropsychological and psychosocial assessment battery was administered to them up to five times before and after injury. Objectives of this project focus on the frequency of head injuries in college football, the impairments that might result from such injury, the duration of impairments, the time course of their recovery, and the possibility of cumulative effects of multiple injuries during the player's college career. Approximately 2500 players were monitored during the study, and nearly 200 players were restudied following minor head injuries. A series of nearly 60 players with orthopedic injuries were tested using the same protocol, and a college student control series of 50 patients were similarly studied. Data analyses are currently underway, and the first report of the findings of this study will be available soon. This article has described the objectives and design of this study, outlined the neuropsychological and psychosocial assessment protocol, and discussed some of the issues related to project implementation. Current data analyses focus on the size of the effects of minor head injury on cognitive and psychosocial performance observed following minor head injury. Upon completion of the initial data analyses, our analysis plan includes having at least two neuropsychologists make independent assessments of the clinical significance of the findings. Similar assessments will be made of the neurophysical symptoms and complaints and psychosocial performance of players after injury.\r"

These children, 5 males and 6 females, ranged in age from 3 to 17 years. They manifested normal to severely retarded intelligence. Although valproate levels were in the therapeutic range, seizure control was inadequate. When clorazepate was added to valproate therapy a marked reduction in seizure frequency occurred within 24 hours and became optimal within 48 to 72 hours. Side effects were minimal with the exception of a nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizure in a single patient. Three children were withdrawn from therapy after a year because of recurrent seizures. One patient was restarted on therapy after 6 months and seizure control improved. Clorazepate may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of primary generalized seizures in children.\r"

During an attack, consciousness is unaltered, but severe vertigo makes walking impossible and vomiting is frequent and severe. An attack is marked by horizontal and vertical jerk nystagmus, accompanied by vertigo which is sometimes worsened by position; however, there is no muscular weakness. During an attack, blood gases, ammonia, and amino acid studies are normal. Between attacks patients manifest combinations of slight horizontal or vertical jerk nystagmus or mild clumsiness. Cochlear and labyrinthine studies and neurologic investigations were noncontributory. Conventional therapies for vertigo, epilepsy, and migraine were ineffective, but acetazolamide (250-500 mg/day) stopped the attacks.\r"

A CSF sample was obtained within the first day of life for cytochemical analysis, culture, and lactate determination with simultaneous determination of serum lactate. The mean CSF lactate level in Group 1B (4.5 mmol/L) was significantly higher than in Group 1A (2.5 mmol/L) (p less than .001). In comparison to the highest CSF lactate concentrations in the normal range in Group 2 (2.7 mmol/L), all Group 1B neonates had elevated CSF lactate levels, and eight neonates (34%) of Group 1A had increased levels. A correlation was found between blood and CSF lactate levels in asphyxiated infants (r = .42, p less than .05), but its meaning is uncertain.

  ".W": "The relatively high incidence of persistent post-traumatic headache and vertigo in children and adolescents presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. It is often difficult to differentiate between functional complaints generated by psychological trauma or compensation-seeking and symptoms reflecting an organic etiology. The clinical and laboratory findings of 22 patients with post-traumatic headaches and vertigo were delineated into five major diagnostic categories: labyrinthine concussion, whiplash syndrome, basilar artery migraine, vertiginous seizures, and a non-specific post-traumatic dizziness. Patients with post-traumatic hearing loss were excluded from this study because they represent a group with different diagnostic problems and more recognizable organic pathology. Each patient had a complete neurologic evaluation including specific clinical vestibular tests (i.e., stepping test, reinforced Romberg, past-pointing evaluation, and positional tests using the Nylen-Hallpike maneuver. Laboratory studies included skull x-ray, computed tomography, electroencephalography, electronystagmography, and audiologic assessment. Symptoms, signs, and tests were evaluated in each category of post-traumatic vertigo to help establish the diagnosis and initiate treatment.\r"

Although the remaining 6 were undiagnosed, 2 exhibited deteriorating courses and the other 4 presented variable combinations of organomegaly, developmental delay or mental retardation, seizures, facial dysmorphism, or bony abnormalities. Thus, these individuals also may have metabolic disorders with abnormal excretions of sialic acid-containing compounds. With awareness of age-related excretion rates, sialic acid screening is most useful for the sialidoses, mucolipidoses, and disorders of free sialic acid metabolism.\r"

However, the latencies of Wave I both before and after exchange transfusions were within normal limits. The central conduction times were prolonged by hyperbilirubinemia, but the peripheral auditory pathways were not impaired. These auditory brainstem response abnormalities became normal with decreased serum bilirubin concentration. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is associated with transient brainstem lesions which are reversible in the early stages. Auditory brainstem response testing is an effective and readily available technique for detecting bilirubin neurotoxicity.\r"

A 6-month-old black female presented with a right focal seizure, a flaccid right hemiparesis, decreased pulses in the right arm, a large left frontoparietal hypodense area on computed tomography, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Cerebral angiography demonstrated irregular dilatation of both carotid arteries and narrowing of the left middle cerebral artery. Aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva, dilatation of the aortic root, narrowing of the origins of both carotid arteries, and beading of the descending aorta were demonstrated by cardiac angiography. The patient was treated with prednisone (2 mg/kg/day) and azathioprine (1 mg/kg/day). There was gradual return of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate to normal over the ensuing 3-10 months, resolution of the hemiparesis, and acquisition of normal developmental milestones. Digital subtraction angiography revealed improvement in the appearance of the descending aorta and of the common carotid arteries with the disappearance of the arterial wall irregularities. Early diagnosis and vigorous immunosuppression may improve outcome in this rare and often fatal vascular disease in childhood.\r"

Four patients (3 with neuronal ceroidlipofuscinoses and 1 with Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome) had discrete, yellow-orange, 1-2 microns autofluorescent granules in the cytoplasm of some lymphocytes. These granules corresponded to characteristic inclusions of neuronal ceroidlipofuscinoses demonstrated by electron microscopy. Five patients (4 undiagnosed or nonspecific disease, and 1 with Leber congenital amaurosis) had hazy green cytoplasmic autofluorescence which correlated with parallel tubular arrays in lymphocytes. The 3 patients with no autofluorescence had no ultrastructural lymphocytic inclusions. We conclude that buffy coat autofluorescence is a rapid and inexpensive method of identifying specimens that require electron microscopic confirmation, and the absence of autofluorescence of lymphocytes in a buffy coat specimen eliminates the necessity for electron microscopic examination. However, characteristic ultrastructural inclusions associated with neurodegenerative diseases may occur in other tissues, such as skin and conjunctiva.\r"

Once fully developed, they may offer no clues as to preceding etiologic agents or pathogenesis. Serial sonography in the neonatal period of 14 patients with periventricular leukomalacia provided documentation of the evolution of certain ventricular patterns. When recognized early, these ventricular changes have prognostic significance because periventricular leukomalacia can produce serious neurologic sequelae. If found later in childhood, periventricular leukomalacia can be suggested as the original pathology. Ventricular deformities can be generalized (12 patients) or focal (11 patients); the various types of distortions are seen frequently in combination. The generalized form of ventricular expansion consisted of uniform expansion of the parieto-occipital components (hydroporencephaly), following extensive periventricular white matter necrosis. Hydroporencephaly is a new form of ex vacuo hydrocephalus in the pediatric age group. Focal changes are caused by more localized white matter cavitations with ventricularization of ensuing porencephalic cysts. These changes result in a footprint-shaped ventricular pattern (10 patients) or in frontal/occipital (polar) ventricular pointing (4 patients). White matter necrosis in other areas may lead to ventricles with bumpy contours (5 patients).\r"

The other infants had good neurologic outcomes at age 18 months despite low mean CPPs (less than 30 mm Hg). These low CPPs were determined to be dependent on mean arterial blood pressures and not on intracranial pressures which were low in all infants (and even lower in more premature infants with apnea). Methylxanthine treatment of apnea of prematurity did not apparently change CPP, despite hypothetical effects on cerebral and peripheral vascular tone. Although fairly low CPP can be associated with good neurologic outcome, it may not be useful in monitoring newborn infants.\r"

The pectoralis major was the most readily elicitable reflex in all infants (100%), regardless of maturity. Achilles, patellar, biceps, thigh adductors, and brachioradialis reflexes also were obtained in at least 98% of babies of greater than 33 weeks gestation. Among these reflexes, less mature infants (less than 33 weeks gestation) had decreased elicitation rates for patellar and biceps reflexes and overall had diminished reflex intensity when compared to older infants (33-36 weeks gestation). By order of decreasing rate, finger flexors, jaw, crossed adductors, and triceps reflexes were less frequently elicited in both groups. Equal DTRs were obtained often in healthy and previously ill infants of less than 33 weeks gestation. Head position had no apparent affect on the ability to elicit reflexes. Theophylline therapy tended to intensify the Achilles reflex and the quiet, wakeful state appeared to be the most optimal state for the elicitation of DTRs.\r"

  ".W": "Two families with benign familial neonatal seizures evident over three generations are presented with emphasis on clinical and electroencephalographic features. Benign familial neonatal seizures represent a disorder with the onset of frequent generalized seizures during the first weeks of life. Family history reveals autosomal dominant inheritance of this disorder. The neonates are neurologically normal and outcomes are usually benign. In our families, none of the patients had seizures after the first ten months of life, with long-term follow-up ranging from 10 months to 56 years. The use of antiepileptic medication seems to have little effect on course or eventual outcome. The electroencephalograms, both initially and subsequently, ranged from normal to epileptiform and did not correlate with risk for further seizures in infancy or subsequent epilepsy. Benign familial neonatal seizures are a distinct clinical entity whose key features and favorable prognosis should be appreciated by all those caring for sick neonates. This recognition would result in an early diagnosis and conservative treatment.\r"

Neuropathologic studies have demonstrated vasculitis, arachnoiditis, and ventriculitis with secondary edema and encephalomalacia. Areas of cerebral infarction, most commonly thought to be venous in origin, have been reported as well. We performed cranial computed tomographic scans on all eight neonates with bacterial meningitis admitted to our Newborn Special Care Unit within the past 36 months and demonstrated abnormalities in seven. Six of these infants were found to have large areas of infarction related primarily to major arterial vascular distributions. We suggest computed tomographic studies for all neonates with bacterial meningitis and subsequent scans at 4-6 months of age in those with abnormal neonatal scans in order to plan better for early intervention services.\r"

Due to the absence of neurologic abnormalities, cognitive deficits, or self-mutilation, HGPRT activity was measured by intact fibroblast assay which revealed partial enzyme deficiency. The presence of an unstable mutant enzyme may have led to the discrepancy between the erythrocyte and fibroblast studies. This discrepancy emphasizes the difficulty in assaying this enzyme solely utilizing red blood cell studies to determine a patient's course. In order to provide an accurate prognosis and relevant genetic counseling, measurement of this enzyme utilizing intact fibroblasts is critical after establishing a diagnosis of HGPRT deficiency in a hyperuricemic male lacking typical clinical manifestations of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, but having enzyme activity of erythrocytes consistent with the diagnosis.\r"

Four epileptic syndromes were particularly affected: childhood absence epilepsy; focal symptomatic, frontal lobe epilepsy; Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy. Eight of the 26 patients developed new-onset absence seizures and three patients with established absence epilepsy experienced absence status. Other seizure types, including atonic, tonic-clonic, and myoclonic, developed in eight patients treated with CBZ, and new generalized spike-and-wave discharges were observed in electroencephalograms of nine patients. CBZ is a widely used, effective antiepileptic drug, particularly for partial or partial complex seizures; however, if uncontrolled, generalized seizures occur after CBZ is prescribed for children or adolescents with absence or mixed seizures, a trial of CBZ discontinuation is warranted. The data reported here do not permit calculation of the incidence of this phenomenon.\r"

Lung biopsies from both patients demonstrated similar histopathologic features with features of lymphocytic interstitial infiltrates and accumulation of macrophages in the air spaces. Immunoperoxidase studies of the lung biopsy from 1 patient revealed that the lymphocytic infiltrate was composed predominantly of T cells of the T8 subset. Each patient was treated with prednisone, with improvement or resolution of pulmonary symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and growth failure.

Blood flow was increased by construction of an arteriovenous fistula between the right iliac artery and vein in six cynomolgus monkeys fed a diet containing 2% cholesterol and 25% peanut oil. The left iliac artery served as the control. Serum cholesterol increased from 135 +/- 22 mg/dl to 880 +/- 129 mg/dl during the experiment. After 6 months, blood flow in the right iliac artery (420 +/- 95 ml/min) was 10 times greater than in the left iliac artery (44 +/- 9 ml/min, p less than 0.005). Flow velocity in the right iliac artery (31 +/- 6 cm/sec) was more than twofold greater than in the left (12 +/- 1 cm/sec, p less than 0.05). Despite the marked difference in blood flow and flow velocity, calculated wall shear stress was the same in both the right (16 +/- 4 dynes/cm2) and left iliac vessels (15 +/- 2 dynes/cm2) because of a twofold increase in lumen diameter (p less than 0.001) of the right iliac artery. Shear stress in the aorta was also normal (12 +/- 2 dynes/cm2). There was no difference in plaque deposition or mean intimal thickness between the right and left iliac arteries. In the right iliac artery there was a twofold increase in media cross-sectional area (p less than 0.001) but no change in media thickness or total wall thickness. Tangential wall tension and tangential wall stress were two times greater on the right than on the left (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the influence of operation sequence and staging on the outcome of aortic graft infection, we studied the mortality and amputation rates and incidence of new graft infection involving the extra-anatomic bypass (EAB) among 101 patients treated for secondary aortoenteric fistula (N = 43) or primary perigraft infection (N = 58). Patients were retrospectively grouped according to the operative treatment technique. Seven patients underwent infected graft removal (IGR) followed immediately by EAB (traditional). Fifty-seven patients were revascularized first, followed by immediate IGR in 38 patients (sequential) or by delayed IGR in 19 patients (staged). The median interoperative interval for the staged group was 5 days (range 2 to 31 days). Twenty patients underwent simultaneous IGR and in-line autogenous reconstruction (synchronous) and finally in 15 patients treatment consisted of IGR only with no extremity revascularization (none). The mean follow-up interval for all patients was 36.8 months. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality rate (traditional, 43%; sequential, 24%; and staged, 26%) or incidence of new graft infection (traditional, 43%; sequential, 18%; or staged, 16%) among those patients treated with EAB, although there was a trend toward an improved outcome with either sequential or staged treatment. There was a significantly lower amputation rate among sequential patients (11%) (p = 0.038) but not staged patients (16%) (p = 0.171) when compared with traditional treatment (43%). Staged operative treatment was associated with significantly less physiologic stress than sequential treatment as reflected by multiple perioperative metabolic variables (95% confidence limits). The treatment groups were comparable in the incidence of aortoenteric fistulas, culture-negative infections, emergent procedures, and appropriate antibiotic use. We conclude that reversed sequence or staged operative treatment of infected aortic grafts can be performed with no increased patient risk. Although traditional or sequential treatment may be required in the setting of acute hemorrhage, the staged operative approach is recommended for the treatment of chronic aortic graft infections.\r"

  ".W": "Sequential external pneumatic compression (SEPC) has been reported to decrease the incidence of acute deep venous thrombosis in postoperative patients by a direct mechanical action on the lower extremity veins and/or by inducing alterations in systemic fibrinolysis. To evaluate the effect of SEPC on venous function in the postoperative patient, pre- and postoperative venous capacitance (VC) and outflow (VO) were measured in a series of general surgical patients. In phase I, 17 limbs were evaluated in patients who had been fully ambulatory preoperatively and at complete bed rest postoperatively. VC decreased from 3.19 +/- 0.43 cc/100 cc of tissue (mean +/- standard error of the mean) preoperatively to 2.08 +/- 0.34 cc/100 cc of tissue postoperatively (p less than 0.05) and VO decreased from 87.2 +/- 10.6 cc/100 cc of tissue/min preoperatively to 58.1 +/- 8.7 cc/100 cc of tissue/min postoperatively (p less than 0.025). In phase II SEPC was begun preoperatively and continued for 24 hours postoperatively on one limb of 20 patients. SEPC prevented the decrease in VC and VO both in the pumped leg (VC-2.65 +/- 0.26 cc/100 cc of tissue preop, 2.40 +/- 0.18 cc/100 cc of tissue postop, p greater than 0.2; VO-72.3 +/- 5.9 cc/100 cc of tissue/min preop, 66.2 +/- 5.3 cc/100 cc of tissue/min postop, p greater than 0.2) and in the unpumped limb (VC-2.85 +/- 0.18 cc/100 cc of tissue preop, 2.41 +/- 0.24 cc/100 cc of tissue postop, p greater than 0.05; VO-66.1 +/- 5.2 cc/100 cc of tissue/min preop, 66.7 +/- 6.7 cc/100 cc of tissue/min postop, p greater than 0.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were 64 elective operations, eight operations on expanding aneurysms, and 19 procedures done for frank rupture. The mortality rate was 4.2% for the nonruptured aneurysm group compared with 36.8% for those patients with rupture. It may be suggested from this study that surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms can be done safely in low volume in smaller community hospitals and that such surgery need not be regionalized to larger institutions.\r"

  ".W": "Injury to the accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI) during carotid endarterectomy is rare; to date only three cases have been reported in the literature. Traction on the sternocleido-mastoid muscle was the proposed mechanism of injury in all three cases. Four cases of accessory nerve palsy occurred in 850 carotid endarterectomies performed between 1978 and 1986 at this institution, an incidence of 0.47%. All four patients had classic signs and symptoms of accessory nerve injury, which developed between 20 and 60 days after operation. The three most recent cases were examined specifically for accessory nerve injury in the immediate postoperative period and exhibited normal trapezius function. None had any other central nervous system dysfunction. Two of these patients regained full accessory nerve function and the most recent case is showing signs of reinnervation with conservative therapy. Isolated central nervous system and spontaneous accessory nerve palsies are exceptionally rare, and since any traction injury or transection should have been detected by postoperative examinations in three of four patients, we propose surgical scar formation as a mechanism of accessory nerve palsy after carotid endarterectomy. If such a palsy develops in the postoperative period, we recommend conservative therapy.\r"
