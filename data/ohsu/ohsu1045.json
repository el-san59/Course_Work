  ".W": "Studies have shown that a proportion of patients with severe chronic infection due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lack antibody to a component of EBV nuclear antigen. However, it is not clear whether this circumstance is one of cause or effect in regard to the pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS); it is clearly not pathognomonic since it also occurs in persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and--rarely--in those with other EBV-related conditions. Stress and depression may be other pathogenetic mechanisms that could reactivate EBV and lead to CFS; examples of this phenomenon are given. The syndrome might also follow certain other viral infections as part of a process that has been called postinfectious neurasthenia. Currently, the cause(s) and cure of CFS, a common and distressing syndrome, are enigmatic and require multidisciplinary study.\r"

  ".W": "The epidemiologic research approach is perhaps most appropriate for initial studies of chronic fatigue syndrome since the syndrome is vaguely defined, scientific knowledge about it is limited, and an infectious etiology is suspected. Several priority needs appropriate for epidemiologic research are identified, including a refinement of diagnostic criteria; a greater understanding of the natural history of the syndrome; basic incidence, prevalence, and mortality statistics; information on whether asymptomatic cases exist; etiologic studies of possible heterogeneity of cases; investigations of clusters of cases; and determinations of whether patients with the syndrome have an increased risk of malignancy. Because of the lack of cogent etiologic hypotheses regarding the syndrome, case-control studies are identified as a high priority for research. The many difficulties encountered in conducting such research are discussed and approaches to dealing with these problems are suggested.\r"

The evidence for these models is discussed. The potentially confounding effect of depression on tests of immune function and neuropsychological testing is described. The implications of these different models for the design of studies of CFS are examined.\r"

The researchers' overall goal is to use clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory data to provide clues about the etiology of this syndrome. In preparation for this symposium, a review of numerous publications on CFS has indicated that the literature generally does not reflect the application of optimal statistical methods for exploration of data. Whenever the researchers' aim is to generate hypotheses, modern methods designed specifically for exploratory data analysis are likely to provide greater insights into any patterns of data than are the traditional approaches to hypothesis testing. In addition, the use of formal methods of data synthesis for ongoing and future research on CFS is a means of strengthening collaborative efforts and of improving the ability of researchers to interpret the evidence available that relates to specific etiologic factors. The inclusion on the research team of experienced biostatisticians, who would oversee the statistical methods and the development of innovative analyses, is recommended.\r"

Most research on fatigue has been oriented towards work or performance of tasks and has involved laboratory studies of healthy individuals, while the study of fatigue as encountered in clinical settings has received minimal attention from investigators. This paper recommends that the natural history of chronic fatigue in its various clinical presentations be studied and that standardized assessment tools be used in this process. An investigation of the tools available for the assessment of fatigue yielded single-item, unidimensional, and multidimensional instruments. Additionally, the apparent association between affective illness and the chronic fatigue syndrome is addressed, and the fact that this relationship depends on issues of measurement is explored.\r"

Strength, a function of muscle cross-sectional area, motor-unit recruitment, and neuromuscular coordination, is the ability to develop force in a single, brief, maximal-effort voluntary contraction of rested muscle. Weakness is a diminished ability of rested muscle to exert maximal force. Fatigue is a loss of maximal force-generating capacity that develops during muscular activity, likely originates within muscle itself, and persists until muscle is fully recovered. Individual perception of motor effort can be determined with standardized rating scales. These concepts are discussed in detail, their relevance to the pathophysiology of exercise in chronic fatigue syndrome is analyzed, and a general strategy of exercise evaluation pertinent to chronic fatigue syndrome is presented.\r"

The sea urchin egg uses an oxidative cross-linking reaction that requires hydrogen peroxide and a secreted peroxidase and thus faces the challenge of oxidant stress at the beginning of its development. Protection from the deleterious effects of this oxidative mechanism is afforded by regulation of the production and utilization of oxidizing species. This regulation requires a specific protein kinase C-activated oxidase and ovothiol, an intracellular antioxidant.\r"

Transfection of these chimeric receptors into rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells resulted in appropriate cell surface expression. Biological activity mediated by the EGF-NGF chimeric receptor was assayed by the induction of neurite outgrowth in response to EGF in stably transfected cells. Furthermore, the chimeric receptor mediated nuclear signaling, as evidenced by the specific induction of transin messenger RNA, an NGF-responsive gene. Neurite outgrowth was not observed with chimeric receptors that contained the transmembrane domain from the EGFR, suggesting that the membrane-spanning region and cytoplasmic domain of the low-affinity NGFR are necessary for signal transduction.\r"

During early corticogenesis, neuroblasts are physiologically coupled by gap junctions into clusters of 15 to 90 cells. The coupled cells form columns within the ventricular zone and, by virtue of their membership in clusters, have low apparent membrane resistances and generate large responses to the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. As neuronal migration out of the ventricular zone progresses, the number of cells within the clusters decreases. These clusters allow direct cell to cell interaction at the earliest stages of corticogenesis.\r"

Among cells that remained in their new positions, those transplanted about 1 hour before axogenesis developed axonal trajectories that were appropriate for their original soma positions, whereas those transplanted 2 to 3 hours before axogenesis developed morphologies appropriate for their new soma positions. These results suggest that motoneuronal identity is determined before axogenesis.\r"

This compound selectively antagonized binding to the V1 subtype of the vasopressin receptor in a competitive manner. In vivo, the compound acted as a specific antagonist of arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced vasoconstriction. After oral administration in conscious rats, the compound also antagonized pressor responses to AVP. OPC-21268 can be used to study the physiological role of AVP and may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic venous disease is increasingly treated surgically with a variety of experimental procedures. Noninvasive volume tests are commonly used before surgery to select patients and after surgery to assess results. Rapid volume changes are considered to indicate regurgitation. Rigorous statistical validation of tests and the confounding nature of unmeasured arterial inflow are seldom considered. Volume changes were measured in 29 control limbs and 35 limbs with venous disease, with mercury-in-silicone rubber strain gauges, for both exercise and elevation. Normalization for arterial flow permitted calculation of the regurgitation rate. Normal (95% confidence) limits for measured and calculated parameters were determined. Specificity was shown by the percent of normal parameter values for control limbs and sensitivity by the percent of abnormal values for extremities with venous disease. Arterial flow significantly altered volume curves. Normalization increased specificity and sensitivity significantly. Calf exercise tests, even normalized, were too insensitive to be reliable. Elevation tests were significantly more sensitive for determining regurgitation. However, exercise tests were useful and supplied important information about the calf muscle pump. We conclude that, as currently used, many limb volume test procedures are unsuitable but could be improved significantly by normalization to reduce the confounding effect of regional arterial flow and use of an elevation test to measure regurgitation.\r"

All patients had class III, severe chronic venous insufficiency. One hundred five of 113 patients (93%) experienced complete ulcer healing in a mean of 5.3 months. One hundred two patients were compliant with elastic compression stockings, and 11 patients were noncompliant. Complete ulcer healing occurred in 99 of 102 patients (97%) who were compliant versus six of 11 patients (55%) who were noncompliant (p less than 0.0001). The influence of noncompliance, previous venous ulceration, previous venous surgery, previous known deep venous thrombosis, peripheral arterial insufficiency (ankle brachial systolic blood pressure index less than or equal to 0.60), pretreatment ulcer duration, ulcer size, age, sex, diabetes, smoking, and photoplethysmography venous refill time on ulcer healing was determined by logistic regression analysis. Only noncompliance with elastic compression stockings (p less than 0.0001) and a pretreatment ulcer duration of more than 9 months (p = 0.02) significantly decreased initial ulcer healing. Posthealing follow-up was available in 73 patients for a mean of 30 months. Fifty-eight patients (79%) continued to be compliant with stockings; 15 patients were noncompliant. Total ulcer recurrence in patients who were compliant was 16%. Five-year lifetable recurrence was 29%. All patients who were noncompliant had recurrent ulceration by 36 months. Previous ulceration, previous venous surgery, and peripheral arterial insufficiency had no effect on ulcer recurrence (p greater than 0.05).\r"

Sixty-seven patients with the T3N1M0 subgroup of stage IIIA disease were evaluated, in which 34.9 +/- 13.4 nodes were dissected in extended lymph node dissection, and 6.5 +/- 6.2 were metastatic. Routine postoperative systemic chemotherapy with mitomycin C and N1-(2'-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil was administered. With this approach, the 5-year survival rate of stage IIIA disease was 47.6%. By Cox proportional hazards model, diameter of serosal invasion was the only significant determinant of prognosis in the T3N1M0 subgroup. The predicted 5-year survival rate for 24 patients with serosal invasion less than 3.0 cm in diameter was 59.5%, compared with 11.5% for 38 patients with invasion of 3.0 cm or larger in diameter. The number of metastatic nodes and the type of operation (total gastrectomy or less than total gastrectomy) did not affect the prognosis. When gastric cancer has both positive serosal invasion and metastatic regional lymph nodes, the diameter of serosal invasion is the more important factor for predicting prognosis.\r"

A set of sliced-image data from a computerized tomography and/or a magnetic resonance imaging was used to reconstruct the liver, the vessels, and the tumors of the patients with liver cancer. A good agreement of anatomic locations of both the intrahepatic vessels and the tumors between the reconstructed liver model and the echography done intraoperatively was observed. Surgical simulations with these graphic models clearly indicated safety areas for needle puncture in the laser coagulation therapy. In addition liver volumes were calculated within 3% of error in comparison to the measured values. These results indicate that the computer-aided surgery system is a highly promising method that avoids cumbersome stereoscopic recognition of the anatomical location of the diseased area and the vessels, before and after surgery.\r"

Three hundred seventy-six patients underwent 400 reconstructions of the internal carotid artery. The mortality rate of the entire series was 0.8%. In 383 procedures, SEP amplitudes were always present during cross-clamping of the internal carotid artery. In spite of that, three neurologic deficits occurred, but all were associated with technical failures and not related to clamping ischemia. Complete loss of SEP amplitudes was noted in 17 procedures. Five of seven patients without an indwelling shunt showed a neurologic deficit after surgery, whereas shunt insertion in 10 resulted in three neurologic deficits. It is concluded that at present SEP recording is an accurate monitoring method in detecting clamping-related cerebral ischemia during carotid artery surgery.\r"

In this prospective randomized multi-center study, 188 such patients were randomized on admission, either to preoperative and postoperative anticoagulant medication (AC group, n = 94) or no anticoagulant treatment during the first month after surgery (O group, n = 94). Background factors were evenly distributed in the two groups, and 89% of the cases were considered as embolic. Analysis on an intention-to-treat basis showed no differences in outcome after 30 days. Good results, survivors who had amputation, and patients who died in the two groups are given respectively: AC group, 61%, 9%, 30%; O group, 65%, 11%, 24%. The results were similar in the two treatment groups also if only patients with a cardiac source of embolism were analyzed. Local bleeding complications were more common in the AC group (17% vs 2%, p less than 0.01). It is concluded that preoperative and early postoperative anticoagulant medication should not be routinely administered since such treatment is unlikely to improve the short-term results of lower-limb arterial thromboembolectomy while bleeding complications increase. The possible value of late (beyond 1 month) long-term anticoagulant treatment remains to be studied.\r"

Prestudy biostatistical calculations led to the need for 260 patients. Three hundred eight patients were randomized and 19 were excluded after randomization, the majority because of postponed surgery. Analyses were made on the 289 patients on an intention-to-treat basis, as well as on the 247 patients given correct prophylaxis. Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was based on bilateral ascending phlebography on postoperative days 10 through 12. The frequency of deep vein thrombosis on an intention-to-treat basis was 10% in the Org 10172 group and 30% in the dextran 70 group and, on the basis of correct prophylaxis, 12% and 31%, respectively, both differences being significant (p less than 0.001). Two-month mortality rates were equal in the groups. Three fatal pulmonary emboli were seen in the dextran group. Significantly more patients in the dextran group received postoperative transfusions; no other differences in various hemorrhagic parameters were seen. Thus it can be concluded that Org 10172 has a significantly better thromboprophylactic effect than does dextran in patients with hip fractures without significant side effects.\r"

Saline solution was infused through the superficial femoral arteries at 64, 129, and 193 cm levels to calculate volume flow and index of resistance to flow. The in vitro part of the study was undertaken to analyze the effect of different-size catheters on flow rates in a rigid undistensible model. In the hindlimb study the flow differed significantly between two- and one-vessel runoff status at 50 and 100 mm Hg infusion pressures. In the in vitro study, in contrast to the hindlimb study, index of resistance to flow values for different-size catheters remained almost unchanged as the infusion pressure increased, demonstrating the distensibility of the runoff bed in dogs. A preliminary clinical study in 13 patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass surgery demonstrated a good correlation between angiographic runoff evaluation and intraoperative flow values. Valuable information can be obtained about the status of the distal runoff by this simple infusion method, which might be used to improve the prediction of outcome of infrainguinal bypass surgery.\r"

The intraarterial femoral artery pressure measured at rest and during reactive hyperemia served as the \"gold standard\" for the definition of a hemodynamically significant aortoiliac stenosis. Our results, obtained from 93 patients (136 limbs), showed that differences between Doppler spectra obtained from limbs with a hemodynamically significant aortoiliac stenosis and those from limbs without were more pronounced during reactive hyperemia than at rest. The best assessment of aortoiliac obstructive disease could be obtained with a combination of parameters derived from Doppler spectra measured at rest and during reactive hyperemia. With these parameters, obtained by multivariate analysis, 85% of the limbs were diagnosed correctly compared with the gold standard. If angiographic data were added to the gold standard, even 91% of the limbs were diagnosed correctly. We conclude that analysis of Doppler spectra-obtained noninvasively from the common femoral artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia provides an accurate hemodynamic assessment of the aortoiliac segment.\r"

Twelve sheep with a 15% total body surface third-degree burn were monitored over a 4-day postburn period. In six sheep, a single application of a 5% flurbiprofen cream was placed on the burn wound on day 3. Data were compared to both burned and nonburned controls (n = 6). All animals were killed on day 4. Oxygen consumption was increased at day 3 by 28% +/- 10% over the preburn value in all animals. Flurbiprofen significantly attenuated the increase in oxygen consumption, returning the value essentially to baseline by 12 hours after application. Lung and liver peroxidation, as measured by malondialdehyde, was significantly increased in the burned, nontreated sheep at day 4 from a control value of 45 +/- 9 and 110 +/- 12 to 60 +/- 6 and 310 +/- 71 nmol/gm tissue, respectively. In flurbiprofen-treated animals, values were 42 +/- 8 and 160 +/- 18 nmol/gm at day 4, significantly attenuated from burn alone. Protein-rich burn lymph flow remained fourfold increased in both groups, indicating a persistent increase in burn tissue vascular permeability, not modified by flurbiprofen. Burn wound biopsies revealed bacterial contents of less than 10(4) organisms/gram tissue in all animals. We conclude that topical flurbiprofen significantly decreases burn wound-induced systemic hypermetabolism and oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation seen at 3 days after burn injury, but does not attenuate the remaining local burn-wound vascular permeability.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of long-term cholesterol feeding on male rabbit gallbladder prostanoid synthesis and bile phospholipid and bile acid levels was examined. In rabbits fed a 2% cholesterol diet for 2, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 weeks, serum cholesterol levels increased 12-fold or higher (68-fold at 21 weeks) when compared to the control levels. Total prostanoid synthesis was significantly increased at 7 weeks or more of cholesterol feeding with 6-keto PGF1 alpha (PGI2 metabolite) and PGE2 as the major products. By 21 weeks of cholesterol feeding, 6-keto PGF1 alpha and PGE2 levels were increased 15-fold and 11-fold higher, respectively, compared to the control. Total bile phospholipid levels were significantly increased at 12 weeks or more of cholesterol feeding, and total bile acids significantly increased only from 5 through 12 weeks of cholesterol feeding. These data show that long-term feeding male rabbits with a 2% cholesterol diet increased endogenous gallbladder prostanoid synthesis, which was associated with an increase in bile phospholipid levels. Increased rabbit gallbladder bile phospholipids may represent a compensation of the animal for toxic levels of tissue and bile cholesterol. Increased phospholipid levels in the bile or tissue could serve as a source of increased availability of arachidonic acid leading to a nonspecific increase in gallbladder prostanoid synthesis.\r"

A total of 17 pigs received orthotopic small-bowel transplants with either portal or systemic venous drainage. There was no difference in survival between groups. No significant hepatic or metabolic abnormalities that are known to occur in total portosystemic shunting were seen in the group that underwent systemic venous drainage. Alterations in ammonia levels and amino acid analysis between both groups were minor. Histologic evidence of liver atrophy was not observed. Significant nutritional abnormalities were not seen, although weight gain was compromised in both groups. Our findings suggest that systemic venous drainage would be preferable in small-bowel transplantation because it is technically easier and safer to perform in the clinical setting.\r"

Characteristically she was not jaundiced and had no portal hypertension. Quantitative measurements of the degree of hepatocyte hyperplasia showed that over 50% of cells in the hypertrophied lobe were hyperplastic. Surprisingly, a similar percentage of cells in the atrophied lobe were also hyperplastic. No difference was found in the size of hepatocytes between the two lobes or among the hepatocyte subpopulations in the atrophied lobe. The findings in this case suggest (1) lobar atrophy induces a hyperplastic response in more than one half of the cells of the contralateral lobe; (2) the development of atrophy consequent on biliary obstruction is likely the result of destruction of whole cells rather than cytoplasmic loss; (3) the development of a hyperplastic response within the atrophied lobe is a new finding and is consistent with the hormonal theory of hepatic regeneration; and (4) striking compensatory hypertrophy of the liver is associated with normal portal venous pressure.\r"

  ".W": "At present, blood centers and transfusion services have limited alternatives for offsetting the ever-rising costs of health care inputs. In the face of current revenue constraints, cost reduction or cost containment through efficiency improvements or service reduction is the principal available means. Such methods ought to be pursued vigorously by blood bankers with the aid of well-designed costing and other physical measurements systems. Experience indicates, however, that blood bankers, in their attempts to reduce or contain costs, are likely to place undue reliance on cost accounting systems as the means of capturing sought-for benefits. Management must learn enough about methods of costing to judge directly the uses and limitations of the information produced. Such understanding begins with recognition that all costs and cost comparisons should be specific to the purpose for which they are developed. No costing procedure is capable of producing measures generally applicable to all management decisions. A measure relevant to a planning decision is unlikely to be appropriate for performance evaluation. Useful comparisons among sets of organizations of costs, or of measures of physical inputs and outputs, require assurance that the methods of measurement employed are the same and that the sets of organizations from which the measures are drawn are reasonably comparable.\r"

Denuded rabbit arterial segments mounted in annular chambers were exposed to nonanticoagulated blood drawn directly from the antecubital vein. This perfusion system allows the direct visualization of platelet-subendothelium interactions. The deposition of platelets on exposed subendothelium and the presence of fibrin were evaluated morphometrically. Perfusions were performed before and 10 and 120 minutes after the transfusion of PCs that had been obtained by apheresis and administered immediately after collection (A) or separated by centrifugation of blood units and transfused 24 hours after storage at 22 degrees C (B) or 4 degrees C (C). Bleeding times were also determined systematically. The deposition of platelets on the subendothelium increased significantly (p less than 0.01) 10 minutes after transfusions of A and B PCs, but the presence of fibrin did not differ from pretransfusion values. Two hours after the administration of A or B PCs, the improvement of platelet deposition persisted. By then, the presence of fibrin increased markedly (p less than 0.01). The deposition of platelets was not modified after the transfusion of C PCs, but the presence of fibrin was augmented significantly at both posttransfusion times. Comparisons between bleeding times and morphometric results pointed to a possible role of fibrin formation in contributing to primary hemostasis.\r"

The average hospital acquisition cost was calculated by using the prices charged by regional blood centers for blood products. To this cost was added an estimate of costs incurred by hospitals for handling, testing, and administering blood. Across study sites, the average hospital cost per unit transfused was $155 and the average charge to the patient was $219. Acquisition cost, the price that hospitals pay for blood, was 37 percent of the total cost to the hospital; the other 63 percent of the hospital cost included costs for blood bank handling (13%), laboratory tests (43%), and blood administration (7%). Significant variations in blood transfusion cost were found within our sample. Most of the variability can be attributed to geographic location of the blood supply source, type of red cell product transfused, prices charged by blood transfusion services, and the frequency of laboratory tests. The results of this transfusion cost study may be helpful in determining the costs of health care delivery, especially when blood transfusions are indicated.\r"

At 21 degrees C, viscosity increased after 20 weeks of storage; this increase was considerably diminished by the presence of tocopherol in the emulsion. The accumulation of malondialdehyde indicated that there was continuous slow oxidation of the lecithin on storage of the emulsion at either 5 or 21 degrees C; this oxidation was markedly reduced by the presence of tocopherol.\r"

In Group A (n = 10), a 3-hour leukapheresis was performed. An average of 11.8 L of blood was processed with a mean flow rate of 66 mL per minute and a collection rate of 3 mL per minute. The PBSC product contained a mean 1.4 x 10(10) mononuclear cells (MNCs) (lymphocytes and monocytes), 1.27 x 10(6) colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage (CFUs-GM), and an average hematocrit of 4 percent (0.04). Postapheresis blood counts showed significant reductions in MNCs (19%) and platelets (45%) (p less than 0.005). Twenty-four hours later, the MNCs had returned to preapheresis levels. The platelet count returned to baseline only after 7 days. Circulating CFUs-GM remained stable for 3 days after apheresis but were increased twofold by Day 7 after apheresis (p = 0.025). Varying the product hematocrit from 1 percent (0.01) to 13.3 percent (0.13) did not change the number of CFUs-GM collected per MNC. In Group B (n = 4), an average of 18.5 L of blood was processed with a mean flow rate of 94 mL per minute and a collection rate of 3 mL per minute. The PBSC product was collected as four sequential samples and assayed for MNCs and CFUs-GM. Total MNCs averaged 1.7 x 10(10) (an increase of 21% relative to Group A) and CFUs-GM averaged 3.08 x 10(6) (an increase of 143%). Mean MNCs did not vary significantly among the four samples. However, CFUs-GM collected per minute (relative to the first sample) did show 1.26-fold (p = 0.001), 1.86-fold (p = 0.011), and 2.52-fold (p = 0.04) increases in the second, third, and fourth samples. These data suggest that MNCs and committed progenitor cells are recruited during large-volume leukapheresis. Moreover, there is a twofold increase in circulating CFUs-GM 1 week after apheresis.\r"

The aggregation curves (ADP, collagen) and hypotonic shock response of platelets were not influenced by the filtration, and the plasma electrolyte and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations were unaffected. Transmission and scanning electron micrographs showed no difference in platelet ultrastructure before and after filtration. Determination of posttransfusion platelet recovery did not reveal any significant difference from that of nonfiltered platelets.

The study was conducted in three phases: collection of platelets for in vitro studies and determination of donor safety; autologous transfusion of platelets in healthy volunteers; and transfusion of platelets in patients requiring platelet transfusion therapy. Donors had mild hypocalcemia and minimal changes in blood counts except for a platelet count reduction from 288 +/- 50 x 10(3) (288 +/- 50 x 10(9)/L) to 217 +/- 43 x 10(3) per microL (217 +/- 43 x 10(9)/L). A mean of 3.36 +/- 1.24 x 10(11) platelets was collected in the mean volume of 214 mL with red cell and white cell contamination in the range of 10(7). Morphology and aggregation were as described previously in stored platelets. Platelet survival data in eight subjects showed a mean recovery of 61 +/- 11 percent and mean survival of 5.03 +/- 1.07 days by a weighted-mean model. Patients transfused with platelets had mean increments of 23,000 immediately and of 8000 at 24 hours; corrected count increments were 6000 at 1 hour and 4000 at 24 hours. The platelets were successful in providing hemostasis to these patients. Clinically useful 5-day-stored platelets are obtained by using this apheresis technology with a functionally closed system and a citrate-plasticized blood bag.\r"

When type O sera were tested against platelets from blood group A donors, only 9 of 14 positive reactions were observed. Furthermore, the expression of blood group A varied more than 100-fold on platelets derived from individual donors. When anti-HLA-A2 and -B7 were evaluated, 11 of 11 individuals with HLA-A2 and -B7 antigens reacted. In contrast, when platelets from donors whose HLA antigens included HLA-B8 or -B12 were tested with anti-HLA-B8 or -HLA-B12, respectively, positive reactions were observed in only 3 of 7 instances, despite the fact that the lymphocytes reacted strongly. Platelets from 10 HLA-A2-positive donors, which had been stored for up to 20 months at -70 degrees C, were studied. In all cases, frozen-stored platelets reacted well with an anti-HLA-A2. Limited testing with an anti-PlA1 (anti-HPA-1a) showed equal reactivity with fresh and frozen platelets. Finally, the method was compared to a visual immunofluorescence assay using sera from patients who were refractory to platelet transfusions. The results agreed in 30 of 37 comparisons, and most discrepancies were resolved in favor of flow cytometry. It is concluded that flow cytometry is useful for detecting platelet alloantibodies and possibly for prospective platelet crossmatching, as HLA- and platelet-specific antibodies can be identified by using platelets stored frozen for several months.\r"

The need for platelet transfusions due to bleeding and the total number of bleeding episodes were compared for tranexamic acid and placebo courses. Patients received platelet transfusions at the discretion of their personal physician and kept detailed records of bleeding episodes. Of three patients who completed the full study, none had a reduction in the need for platelet transfusions. Moreover, in the eight patients who participated in the study, there was no reduction in number of bleeding episodes during tranexamic acid treatment as compared to the number with placebo. Our data indicate that the prophylactic administration of tranexamic acid does not decrease dependence on platelet transfusions or decrease bleeding episodes in patients with bleeding due to amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia.\r"

This prospective investigation was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients undergoing general anesthesia supplemented by midazolam and fentanyl or sufentanil. Patients received either flumazenil (n = 20) or placebo (n = 10) by random assignment. Analgesic requirements were measured in morphine equivalents (MEs) and were recorded for a three-hour period following the administration of flumazenil. All patients received the assigned treatment within five minutes of arrival to the postanesthesia room. Total ME requirements were 4.1 +/- 3.8 mg for the flumazenil group and 4.5 +/- 4.6 mg (p = 0.71) for the placebo group. Patient analgesic requirements were also assessed when patients were adequately alert. For the flumazenil group this time period was 6.2 +/- 12.7 minutes versus 52.9 +/- 28.4 minutes for placebo (p less than 0.01). MEs (flumazenil 4.1 +/- 3.8 mg vs. placebo 3.7 +/- 3.2 mg) were not significantly different (p = 0.57) when similar levels of consciousness were compared. The onset of pain was more rapid with flumazenil patients as evidenced by the first analgesic dose at 15.7 +/- 25.1 minutes for the flumazenil group versus 34.7 +/- 43.7 for the placebo group; however, these data were not statistically different (p = 0.144). These results suggest that flumazenil does not increase postoperative analgesic requirements during the immediate postanesthesia period; however, patients receiving flumazenil may experience an earlier onset of postoperative pain.\r"

This study was designed to determine the frequency of CBZ hematologic monitoring in one academic setting. Data on complete blood counts (CBCs) were retrospectively obtained and were compared with 1975-88 Physicians' Desk Reference recommendations for weekly CBCs during the first three months of treatment. Eighty-three patients were identified: 32 psychiatry, 37 neurology, and 14 from other clinics. Only one patient met guidelines for monitoring during the entire first three months of treatment. Comparisons between clinics demonstrated no statistically significant differences in monitoring rates. Prospective studies in academic and private practice settings are needed to provide more information on actual monitoring practices. Due to the removal of specific manufacturer recommendations, a standard approach is needed to establish consistent and adequate monitoring and to provide legal support to prescribers.\r"

Serum sodium concentration was 109 mmol/L; the osmolality of the blood and of the urine were 253 mOsmol and 438 mOsmol, respectively, with a specific gravity of 1.025 and a urine sodium of 17 mmol/L. The hyponatremia initially was considered to be the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in response to the patient's suspected pneumonia. Due to worsening blood pressure, lisinopril was restarted and the serum sodium concentration dropped from 134 to 126 mmol/L. Evaluation of the patient's hyponatremia included assessment of thyroid, adrenal, hepatic, and cardiac function that were within normal limits. The patient was discharged on the following medications: sustained-release theophylline 300 mg tid, prednisone 10 mg/d, albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q6h, and sustained-release verapamil 240 mg/d for blood pressure control. Her serum sodium concentration has remained between 135 and 140 mmol/L during hospitalizations for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and for pneumonias 10 and 12 months after discharge.\r"

Fluconazole 100 mg bid was added for a candidal wound infection. The prothrombin time increased from 19 to 65 seconds eight days later and the patient experienced a gastrointestinal bleeding episode. Fresh-frozen plasma was administered and warfarin was discontinued while the patient completed a planned 21-day course of fluconazole. The patient eventually resumed the original warfarin dosage with stable coagulation parameters. Until the influence of fluconazole on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin is studied in further detail, careful monitoring of coagulation parameters is recommended for all patients receiving the combination.\r"

  ".U": "91213520\r", 
  ".W": "Estimates of renal function are frequently used to design individual dosing regimens. The accuracy of these estimates naturally influences their ability to predict certain pharmacokinetic parameters and appropriate drug dosages. Creatinine clearance is the most widely used estimate of renal function. Many formulas have been developed to provide a quick, relatively accurate prediction of creatinine clearance and, supposedly, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, an understanding of the limitations associated with creatinine clearance estimations raises questions concerning their reliability as an aid in individualizing drug therapy. Many factors such as disease states, age, diet, analytical variations, and drug interactions affect the relationship between estimates and measures of creatinine clearance and GFR. As a result, creatinine clearance estimates using these formulas are often poor reflections of measured creatinine clearance or GFR. Also, studies comparing measured creatinine clearance with more accurate methods of assessing renal function (i.e., inulin) reveal errors that are often exaggerated as renal function declines. Therefore, estimated creatinine clearance is twice removed from the associated pharmacokinetic parameter. Despite these limitations, no other clinically relevant and convenient assessment of renal function is available. The authors recommend that the appropriate caveats be considered when using these tools clinically. For drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, estimates of creatinine clearance should only be used to establish initial dosing regimens, with subsequent therapy based on parameters generated from concentration determinations.\r"

  ".W": "The ultimate goal of therapeutic intervention in a critically ill patient is to maintain oxygen homeostasis where delivery of oxygen to the cells is greater than, or at least equal to, the oxygen demand of the cells. Oxygen demand varies from organ to organ. Total body oxygen demand is the sum of all oxygen required by all tissues and organs for aerobic cellular function. Oxygen consumption (VO2) is the quantity of oxygen actually used by the cells. VO2 may be calculated if the values of cardiac output (CO), hemoglobin concentration, and arterial and venous oxygen saturations (SaO2 and SvO2, respectively) are known. Under normal circumstances, the quantities of oxygen demanded and oxygen consumed are equal, but in situations of inadequate oxygen delivery, oxygen demand may not be satisfied and the quantity of oxygen actually consumed will be governed by the quantity delivered. This then may result in an oxygen deficit and, ultimately, cellular death. This article discusses the principles of oxygen homeostasis, techniques for measuring VO2, CO, and SvO2, and the relevance of these principles and techniques to clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "Nafarelin acetate is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist proven as effective as danazol in treating endometriosis. Its proposed mechanism of action is the desensitization of pituitary GnRH receptors leading to a decrease in gonadotropin release, and ovarian hormone serum concentrations similar to those achieved in postmenopausal women. Nafarelin decreases or ablates the physical symptoms associated with endometriosis, and pregnancy rates following therapy with this drug are comparable to rates observed after danazol therapy. Nafarelin is administered by nasal inhalation and has been generally well tolerated. It is associated with a high incidence of adverse effects but they are rarely severe enough to cause withdrawal from treatment, and those occurring most frequently--hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and decreased libido--are a consequence of the hypoestrogenemia induced by the drug. Increased bone turnover occurs in women on nafarelin but biochemical parameters return to pretreatment concentrations by six months after termination of treatment. This agent's place in the therapy of endometriosis will be determined as clinical experience accumulates.\r"

Since 1953, approximately 130 million courses of nitrofurantoin therapy have been distributed in the U.S. alone. The database contained 127 reports of hemolytic reactions; a \"worst-case\" estimate of the incidence rate was 1 in 100,000 courses of therapy. Considering the extensive usage of nitrofurantoin, clinically important hemolytic reactions appeared to be very rare. For the cases in which outcome was recorded, complete recovery occurred in 87 percent of patients. Although nitrofurantoin is contraindicated after the onset of labor and in infants less than one month old, no well-documented cases of hemolytic reactions in neonates were identified.\r"

  ".W": "Early case reports of fatal hematologic effects attributed to carbamazepine (CBZ) resulted in extensive monitoring recommendations by the manufacturer. The rarity of blood dyscrasias led many authors to question the manufacturer's guidelines. Thus the manufacturer removed specific monitoring guidelines, allowing physicians to monitor CBZ using their clinical judgment. This article reviews case reports and studies of CBZ's hematologic effects. Due to their rapid onset, daily laboratory checks would be necessary to monitor for aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. These adverse effects are best monitored by informing patients and physicians to carefully watch for signs and symptoms. Leukopenia develops more slowly, occurring in approximately 12 percent of children and 7 percent of adults. Its onset is typically within the first three months of treatment, with patients at risk having a low or low-normal pretreatment white blood cell (WBC) count. Leukopenia often reverses, even if CBZ is continued. Based upon our review of the literature, we recommend monitoring of those high-risk patients during the first three months of treatment with the frequency being determined by results of each laboratory value. WBC counts less than 3000/mm3 or neutrophil counts below 1000/mm3 warrant a decrease in dose with frequent monitoring or CBZ discontinuation, if necessary.\r"

Antibacterial therapy with a single antibiotic was employed in more than 50 percent of the patients, with cefazolin, cefuroxime, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone sodium representing the most commonly employed agents. Combination therapy using two antibiotics was employed in approximately 30 percent of patients with the aminoglycosides, particularly gentamicin, used extensively. A satisfactory outcome was achieved in approximately 80 percent of patients with a community- or institutional-acquired pneumonia; only 66 percent of nosocomial pneumonias had a satisfactory outcome. An important observation was the apparently common practice of switching patients to an oral antibiotic regimen after an average of seven days of antibiotics and subsequently discharging the patient. No difference was observed in the patterns of clinical response or duration of therapy for culture-positive versus culture-negative patients. The results of this surveillance program can serve as a basis for comparison of institution-specific drug utilization evaluation programs.\r"

Eighty-one key statements were prepared and subsequently analyzed on the basis of a voting system. Of the 45 statements that dealt with existing therapies, only 3 statements showed positive consensus (agreement of two-thirds or more of voters) about mechanisms of ulcer healing. Participants agreed that both (1) hydrogen/potassium adenosine triphosphatase inhibitors and (2) histamine H2 antagonists healed ulcers solely by acid inhibition, and (3) that sucralfate works by topical action. Substantial uncertainty about the mechanisms by which bismuth compounds and antacids heal ulcers was noted as well as their wide range of effects. The mechanism of ulcer healing by prostaglandins and the clinical relevance of antiulcer effects of drugs demonstrated in acute studies with animals were also controversial. There was greater agreement among participants about unexplored drug effects that might produce ulcer healing. Of the 36 such mechanisms surveyed, the most support went to therapies aimed at enhancement of mucosal blood flow, epithelial restitution, and mucosal alkaline secretion or inhibition of luminal pepsin activity. The diversity of opinions among participants suggests a high level of empiricism in the development of ulcer healing drugs apart from those that inhibit acid secretion. This empiricism probably arises from inadequate understanding of processes of mucosal injury and repair.\r"

Its efficacy is unique among tricyclic antidepressants and may be related to its relatively high potency in affecting serotonergic neurotransmission. The drug has many anticholinergic effects, but it is relatively well tolerated by the patients for whom it is effective. A 0.4 percent incidence of seizures, a potentially serious side effect, has been observed. Other antidepressants that are relatively selective for serotonergic (as opposed to noradrenergic) transmission may be as effective as clomipramine in the treatment of this disorder; controlled studies are under way. Clomipramine at low doses is also effective in the treatment of panic disorder and has been used successfully in the treatment of premature ejaculation.\r"

  ".W": "Most antihypertensive drugs act by counteracting vasoconstrictor mechanisms and lower blood pressure by lowering vascular resistance. The beta blockers, which have the unique ability to counteract cardiac sympathetic drive, seem to be a major exception to this. Moreover, their degree of cardiodepression is directly correlated with the initial sympathetic tone and also with their degree of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Cardiodepression initially evokes a baroreflex-mediated proportional rise in vascular resistance. As indicated by review of the literature, the antihypertensive effect of beta blockers always parallels a decline in vascular resistance. Studying beta blockers with different degrees of ISA in 50 hypertensive patients after minimizing cardiac sympathetic drive by strict bed rest showed that the initial effect of the drug is offset by a rise in vascular resistance proportional to the fall in cardiac output. After that, blood pressure always fell in parallel with vascular resistance, whatever the absolute level of cardiac output. In the long run, blood pressure and vascular resistance were always positively correlated, irrespective of the level of cardiac output. Thus, like all other antihypertensive agents, beta blockers also lower blood pressure through interference with a vasoconstrictor mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether excessive reduction of blood pressure (BP) by antihypertensive medications correlates with myocardial infarction, especially during sleep in elderly patients, we used telemetry and cuvette dye-dilution methods to assess the direct BP and the hemodynamics of 68 inpatients with essential hypertension during wakefulness and sleep. There were 25 patients greater than or equal to 60 years old (OH-group) and 43 were less than or equal to 59 years old (YH-group). Of the OH-group, 36% showed high BP during the day, with marked decreases (minimum BP less than 110/70 mm Hg) during sleep. Average cardiac index (CI) of the OH-group was low during wakefulness and extremely low during slow-wave sleep. Changes of mean BP in the OH-group correlated with changes in total peripheral vascular resistance index (TPRI) during sleep, but this correlation was not observed in the YH-group. The antihypertensive effects on nocturnal BP of the various medications was: central adrenergic inhibitors less than or equal to beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity less than or equal to alpha (alpha beta) blockers less than or equal to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors less than or equal to calcium antagonists. Because BP and CI were found to be very low and TPRI seems to play an important role in BP regulation in sleeping elderly patients, excessive antihypertensive medication may be harmful to this subgroup. However, because the effects on nocturnal BP differ among various antihypertensive treatments, further research is required on the relation between antihypertensive medication and the hemodynamics of sleeping elderly hypertensive patients.\r"

The same applies also for beta blockers, although they have been shown to be effective in secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. It is suspected that conventional antihypertensive treatment has an unfavorable effect on coronary risk factors other than hypertension. For instance, thiazide-type diuretics can impair glucose tolerance and increase the potentially atherogenic serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol fraction and triglycerides. Beta blockers without partial intrinsic sympathomimetic activity increase serum triglycerides and tend to lower the potentially antiatherogenic high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Certain beta blockers may also impair glucose tolerance, particularly when they are combined with diuretics. Calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors and alpha 1-receptor blockers do not adversely affect lipoprotein or carbohydrate profiles. The latter two drug classes may even increase insulin sensitivity, and alpha 1 blockers may also slightly improve lipid metabolism. The prognostic relevance of drug-induced dyslipidemia and/or glucose intolerance awaits further clarification. In the meantime, it is of clinical interest that several of the generally available antihypertensive drugs seem to be metabolically neutral or sometimes perhaps even potentially beneficial with regard to the lipoprotein and carbohydrate metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "An increased sympathetic drive combined with decreased parasympathetic inhibition is found in patients with borderline hypertension, who characteristically have rapid heart rates, high cardiac output and relatively normal vascular resistance (hyperkinetic state). In established hypertension, cardiac output is normal, vascular resistance is elevated and signs of increased sympathetic drive are absent. Apparently hemodynamics and sympathetic drive change during hypertension. The mechanism of the hemodynamic transition in the course of hypertension is well understood. Cardiac output returns from elevated to normal values as beta-adrenergic receptors down-regulate and stroke volume decreases (due to decreased cardiac compliance). The high blood pressure induces vascular hypertrophy, which in turn leads to increased vascular resistance. The mechanism of the change of sympathetic tone from elevated in borderline hypertension to apparently normal in established hypertension can best be explained within the conceptual framework of the \"blood-pressure-seeking\" properties of the brain. In hypertension, the central nervous system seeks to maintain systemic blood pressure at the higher level. As hypertension advances and vascular hypertrophy develops, arterioles become hyperresponsive to vasoconstriction. At this point, less sympathetic drive is needed to maintain pressure-elevating vasoconstriction, and the central sympathetic drive is down-regulated. The etiology of increased sympathetic drive in hypertension remains unresolved. Subjects with increased sympathetic drive are also usually overweight and have elevated levels of insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as decreased high-density lipoproteins. Future research must focus on the link between coronary risk factors and sympathetic overactivity in hypertension.\r"

One of the drug's main benefits is its prolonged effect, lasting for 24 hours, which makes it possible to administer bopindolol in a single daily dose, a fact that may improve patient adherence to therapy. A double-blind study was performed in two centers, comparing bopindolol with metoprolol in 86 hypertensive patients. Baseline diastolic blood pressure (BP) was 100 to 120 mm Hg. The effects of bopindolol or metoprolol on BP and heart rate were similar: return to normal values was achieved in 70% of patients with either drug. A 6-month study at another center found that bopindolol did not affect the levels of total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. Another 12-month study documented a decrease in total cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) A1 and apo B. The apo A/B ratio rose, thus improving the atherosclerotic index. No deterioration of glucose tolerance or immunoreactive insulin response to glucose was seen after 6 months of bopindolol administration. Bopindolol satisfactorily modifies not only resting but also exercise BP during isometric and isotonic load, thus reducing BP fluctuation during physical activities of the hypertensive patient. The drug exerts no effect on renal and liver function, electrolyte balance and hematologic parameters. Bopindolol is a very useful drug of first choice in mild and moderate hypertension. Bopindolol's main advantages include its prolonged action, good tolerance and a beneficial effect on risk factors of atherosclerosis (lipid and carbohydrate metabolism).\r"

During this time they have reached the position of first-line therapy for hypertension and are recommended as such by the Joint National Committee (U.S.A.) in 1988 and by the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension in 1983 and 1989. This is because of the favorable relationship between the antihypertensive efficacy of these drugs and the rate and severity of their adverse effects. Of particular interest is the possibility that beta blockers may protect against coronary artery disease (CAD). With regard to secondary prevention against CAD, statistically highly significant and clinically relevant reductions of mortality and the risk of reinfarction have been shown in prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. A primary preventive effect against CAD, on the other hand, has only been shown in open trials without placebo control. However, in spite of the lack of clear proof, this effect still appears to be a logical possibility. Some new findings with beta blockers appear to be of particular interest: beta blockade may reduce myocardial necrosis in patients with marked elevations of plasma catecholamines due to traumatic head injury; a similar protective effect in other situations of severe stress, e.g., acute myocardial infarction, would be of great clinical value. Experimental studies also suggest that beta blockers may have antiatherosclerotic effect in animals fed an atherogenic diet and subjected to stress. Again, clinical confirmation of such results would be of great significance.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, renin, angiotensin and vasopressin are increased in congestive heart failure. By increasing ventricular afterload, heart failure is further worsened, which in turn--in a vicious cycle--stimulates neurohumoral vasoconstrictor mechanisms. Furthermore, because of the compensatory but excessive stimulation of the sympathomimetic system, a down-regulation and desensitization particularly of the myocardial beta 1 receptors and depletion of myocardial catecholamine occurs in chronic heart failure. These defects may be restored toward normal by interventions that attenuate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. A direct approach to modify the excessive vasoconstriction is to administer systemic vasodilator drugs, but despite favorable short-term effects, tolerance developed to most of these drugs during long-term treatment. One reason for the loss of effectiveness is the reflex activation of the sympathetic system, which increases vasoconstrictor hormone concentrations. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system can be modified effectively by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that have shown favorable responses in patients with chronic heart failure. Beta-blocking agents interfere with endogenous sympathetic activation and have produced beneficial effects in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy. Long-term treatment is associated with up-regulation of the number of beta receptors and an improved responsiveness to catecholamines. Owing to the negative inotropic effects of beta-blocking agents, some of the patients with severe heart failure deteriorated hemodynamically and clinically. Theoretically, it should be advantageous to have a substance that combines protection against excessive beta stimulation with a mild inotropic support to prevent cardiac decompensation. This may be achieved by a selective beta 1-partial agonist like xamoterol.\r"

It has long been known that ventricular ectopy predicts sudden cardiac death in coronary heart disease, and this has also been shown in dilated cardiomyopathy. It is less certain whether antiarrhythmic drugs reduce this risk and improve prognosis. Supraventricular arrhythmias frequently develop in heart failure of all causes. They nearly always cause symptoms, and the establishment of atrial fibrillation may mark a permanent deterioration. Except for sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias are often occult. Hypokalemia and digitalis toxicity may have been precipitated by diuretics or interaction with antiarrhythmic drugs. In coronary heart failure, arrhythmias may be related to scar tissue or ischemia, which may also be responsible in dilated cardiomyopathy. Use of inotropes and inodilators may precipitate arrhythmias, whereas drugs that conserve energy or potassium, such as beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may prevent them. Since suppression of ventricular arrhythmias has not been shown to prevent sudden death or prolong life in patients with heart failure, it may be that such arrhythmias do not directly presage ventricular fibrillation except in so far as they are markers of a poor prognosis with a risk of sudden death. If so, such arrhythmias are most likely to be suppressed by agents that result in improvement of left ventricular function and, through that, prolongation of life.\r"

Peripheral vasoconstriction mediated by increased sympathetic tone and activation of the plasma renin-angiotensin system may act primarily for short-term control. The effects of the vascular renin-angiotensin system, impaired flow-dependent, endothelium-mediated dilation (resulting from chronically reduced flow) and structural alterations of the vessel wall slowly emerge with time. In addition, fluid retention may contribute to increased vascular stiffness in chronic heart failure. Improved cardiac output with acute administration of vasodilators and inotropes is not immediately translated into increased blood flow to skeletal muscle, because (1) the reversal of the peripheral alterations described develops slowly over time (in fact, vasodilators and inotropes given acutely may cause redistribution of blood flow in skeletal muscle without improving oxygen availability); and (2) intrinsic abnormalities of skeletal muscle exist in chronic heart failure (e.g., due to chronic deconditioning, resulting in reduced oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle, as suggested by ultrastructural analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Drugs that interfere with the underlying compensatory mechanisms (e.g., renin-angiotensin system) without development of tolerance during long-term therapy exert beneficial effects after long-term treatment (e.g., the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are, in part, due to peripheral mechanisms--the inability of the peripheral vessels to dilate--and to improvement of peripheral oxygen extraction).\r"

Afferent pathways are poorly understood and triggers are both central and peripheral, involving attenuation of atrial and arterial baroreceptor activity. Efferent sympathetic activity is generally increased with resulting vasoconstriction, but responses are organ-specific and differ among heart, kidney, lung and skeletal muscle. Changes in cardiac sympathetic activity are inadequately understood. Enhanced cardiac norepinephrine spillover contrasts with reduced tissue concentration and impaired activity of synthetic enzymes and neuronal catecholamine uptake. Beta-receptor down-regulation further complicates overall adrenergic responsiveness and the balance between enhancement of contractile function and reduction in arrhythmia threshold. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system is potentiated by the sympathetic nervous system and may contribute to vasoconstrictor hyporesponsiveness. Angiotensin II may in turn facilitate the central and peripheral effects of sympathetic activation and the release of vasopressin from the pituitary. Our understanding of the role of vasodilator peptides in heart failure remains rudimentary. It is likely that vasoconstrictor neuroendocrine response adversely influences optimal cardiac function in heart failure and may promote arrhythmogenesis. The neuroendocrine response in individual organs, however, requires intensive study.\r"

The ability of the muscle vasculature to dilate is markedly impaired, in part, because of exaggerated neurohumoral activity increasing vascular wall stiffness. For this reason, increasing cardiac output is not sufficient to increase exercise capacity if not accompanied by improving vascular reactivity. The poor reliability and reproducibility of exercise tolerance assessed by maximal exercise duration or maximal attained work load (particularly on a treadmill) has led to widespread measurement of respiratory gas during exercise. Peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2), even if it is symptom-limited, has been shown to be a very reproducible criterion of exercise tolerance; moreover, because VO2 is the product of cardiac output and arteriovenous oxygen difference, it also has a qualitative hemodynamic significance. Ventilatory threshold can be determined before maximal exercise; however, problems of determination limit the practical value of this criterion. Unfortunately, peak VO2 lacks sensitivity to detect minor improvement or impairment of symptoms during daily life, although these are significant to the patient. Submaximal exercises have been proposed for this purpose and are currently being evaluated.\r"

Measurement techniques for this difficult assessment range from simple unqualified questions on patient well-being to complex statistical analyses of a wide range of lifestyle and activity variables. The factors that influence quality of life during chronic drug therapy differ in the treatment of symptomatic (e.g., heart failure) vs asymptomatic (e.g., hypertension) disease, and include drug side effects, relief of symptoms, improved prognosis, return to work, physical activity and the need for further hospital treatments. The manifestation of quality of life varies for different people leading to lack of agreement on the precise definition. The absence of standardization of methods of measurement also contributes to this and leads to lack of comparability of studies and unreasonable claims by some drug manufacturers. Further complicating issues in multicenter trials across countries include language problems and interethnic differences in \"sickness\" behavior. The recently introduced quality-adjusted life year (QALY) index, designed to take account of both the quality and duration of life in assessing the outcome of treatments, may avoid some of these problems. By classifying illness states (the Rosser index) on the basis of disability and distress, and comparing outcomes in terms of improved prognosis, QALYs have already been used for cost/benefit analyses of a number of new and expensive therapies. Like other methods, QALYs have problems related to variability in individual appreciation of life values. To date, a perfect method of quality of life assessment remains elusive.\r"

Its properties should result in beta-receptor stimulatory effects at low levels of sympathetic tone and beta-receptor protective effects at higher levels of sympathetic tone. The acute effects of intravenous (i.v.) xamoterol on hemodynamics at rest and during exercise were studied in 30 patients with mild to moderate heart failure (13 patients in New York Heart Association class II; 17 in class III) due to ischemic (n = 24) or cardiomyopathic (n = 6) heart disease. Cardiac index, stroke volume and stroke work index at rest were significantly improved after i.v. administration of xamoterol and consistent with net agonist effects. During exercise, heart rate and double product were significantly reduced (net antagonist effects), but with preservation of the expected increases in cardiac index and systolic blood pressure. These hemodynamic findings confirm the ability of xamoterol to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone. Tachyphylaxis and arrhythmogenicity limit the chronic use of drugs with full beta-agonist properties as positive inotropes in heart failure. The patients were therefore entered into a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of chronic oral xamoterol therapy, 200 mg twice daily, and the hemodynamic responses to i.v. xamoterol were repeated at the end of the trial. No impairment in either resting or exercise effects was observed, indicative of a maintained response and absence of tachyphylaxis after chronic therapy. Furthermore, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed no change in ventricular arrhythmias during oral treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether factors associated with smoking, such as dietary intake, alcohol intake, and physical activity, modified or confounded the relationship between smoking and body fat distribution. The study used cross-sectional data for 765 men aged 43-85 y from the Normative Aging Study. Current smokers were found to have a greater amount of central adiposity, as represented by the abdomen-to-hip circumference ratio (abdomen-hip ratio), than did former smokers and people who never smoked after adjustment for age, BMI, dietary and alcohol intakes, and physical activity. Multiple-linear-regression analysis revealed that physical activity was negatively associated with and alcohol intake was positively associated with the abdomen-hip ratio. These results suggest a direct effect of smoking on body fat distribution, independent of other smoking-related behaviors.\r"

By providing information for normal, healthy individuals, these data may be of comparative value for nutritionists and clinicians concerned with body composition of patients with wasting diseases. The data were collected over 20 y in our laboratory by using the same densitometric procedure. A significant increase in FFM:ht occurs during the preadolescent and adolescent years. The adolescent spurt continues for a longer period for boys than for girls, resulting in a significant gender difference beginning at approximately age 16 y and continuing throughout adulthood. A decline in FFM:ht, not statistically significant, appears to occur in men greater than 60 y of age, and a significant decline occurs among women greater than 50 y of age (alpha less than 0.01). Thus, both gender- and age-related trends that have implications for the interpretation of comparative body-composition status are suggested.\r"

The prediction of body fat (by DEXA) by anthropometric variables alone gave an r2 of 0.94 and the corresponding SEEs were 1.61 kg for men and 2.43 kg for women. When BIA variables were added as predictors, r2 increased by 2-5% (P less than 0.05) and the corresponding SEE decreased by 25% (P less than 0.05). The prediction of body fat (by DEXA) in elderly subjects and by BIA or anthropometry with equations developed in populations of young healthy adults (adapted from the literature) was generally not good although the correlation coefficients were high (r greater than 0.9, P less than 0.001), which suggests that our equations may improve prediction of body fat in elderly subjects.\r"

Thirteen females were randomly assigned to either a low-fat diet (20-25% of calories as fat) or a control diet (35-40% fat) for 11 wk. After a 7-wk washout period, the conditions were reversed for another 11 wk. Energy intake on the low-fat diet gradually increased by 0.092 kJ/wk resulting in a total caloric compensation of 35% by the end of the 11-wk treatment period. This failure to compensate calorically on the low-fat diet resulted in a deficit of 1.22 kJ/d and a weight loss of 2.5 kg in 11 wk, twice the amount of weight lost on the control diet. These results demonstrate that body weight can be lost merely by reducing the fat content of the diet without the need to voluntarily restrict food intake.\r"

In study 1 this increase was accompanied by a reduction in total weight of food consumed when compared with values obtained under low-fat-diet conditions. Moreover, the occurrence of satiety coincided with a level of carbohydrate intake corresponding to the expected daily carbohydrate oxidation when high-fat foods contained a moderate amount of carbohydrates. In study 2, where the carbohydrate content of high-fat foods was unusually low (less than or equal to 25% of their energy content), carbohydrate intake was lower than usual carbohydrate oxidation. Under the conditions of this study, energy density of foods seemed to play a significant role on the occurrence of satiety.\r"

Anorexia nervosa patients expended more energy as physical activity than did control subjects [0.084 +/- 0.012 vs 0.044 +/- 0.008 MJ/kg body wt, respectively (20.1 +/- 3.0 vs 10.5 +/- 1.9 kcal/kg body wt, respectively), P less than 0.04], although they had a lower BMR [4.17 +/- 0.37 vs 5.52 +/- 0.15 MJ/d, respectively (997 +/- 89 vs 1319 +/- 37 kcal/d, respectively), P less than 0.01]. TDEE and TEM were similar in both groups. There was a reduction in serum triiodothyronine (T3; 1.20 +/- 0.15 vs 2.04 +/- 0.13 nmol/L, respectively; P less than 0.003) and a slight reduction in serum thyroxine (T4); reverse T3, thyrotropin, free T4, serum cortisol, and adrenocorticotropin values were normal. BMR correlated with total body weight and fat-free mass. These results provide quantitative evidence for increased physical activity in anorexia nervosa despite profound underweight and hypometabolism.\r"

Hunger-related ratings after drink consumption were generally highest for water, lower for noncaloric sweeteners (NCSs), and lowest for sugar.

These changes reflect augmented de novo synthesis of fatty acids (8:0, 10:0, 12:0, and 14:0) in the mammary gland and a tendency of increasing fat-globule size as milk matures. Transitional and mature milks, but particularly colostrum, contained higher concentrations of components considered to be derived from the fat-globule membrane (cholesterol, tocopherols, percentage long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) compared with those reported for Western countries. Percentage medium-chain fatty acids in mature milk was two to three times higher than in developed countries.

Barley contains beta-glucan as a source of soluble dietary fiber (DF) whereas wheat contains the largely insoluble cellulose and hemicellulose fiber. Total dietary fiber increased from a previous intake of 21-38 g/d during the period of study for the two groups. Consumption of barley relative to wheat foods was associated with a significant fall in both plasma total cholesterol (6%, P less than 0.05) and in low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (7%, P less than 0.02) whereas triglyceride and glucose concentrations did not change significantly.

Compared with 39 control subjects, 39 antioxidant-supplemented men experienced the following net reductions during the double-blind period: 20% (P = 0.012) in serum lipid peroxides, 24% (P = 0.035) in ADP-induced platelet aggregation, 42% (P = 0.040) in the rate of ATP release during aggregation, 51% (P = 0.018) in serum (platelet-produced) thromboxane B2, and 29% (P = 0.024) in plasma beta-thromboglobulin concentration. The data support our hypothesis that antioxidant supplementation of men with low antioxidant status and high fat intake reduces lipid peroxidation, the capacity of platelets to aggregate and to produce thromboxane A2, and in vivo platelet activation.\r"

To evaluate the ability of yogurt beta-gal to digest lactose when yogurt is consumed with food or with additional lactose, 22 healthy lactose-maldigesting individuals were fed 10 test meals. Results of breath-hydrogen expiration, incidence of symptoms, and enzyme and lactose content of gastric aspirates indicate that the consumption of a meal with yogurt does not inhibit, and may slightly improve, lactose digestion from yogurt. However, yogurt beta-gal appears unable to assist in the digestion of additional lactose beyond that normally present in yogurt.\r"

Serial electroencephalographic (EEG) tracings, peripheral nervous system tests, periodontal evaluations, and biochemical measures of vitamin B-6 status were conducted. Within 12 d on the depletion diet, two of the eight women exhibited abnormal EEG tracings. These changes were readily reversed by repletion of vitamin B-6 at the 0.5-mg/d level. Biochemical measures reflected lowered vitamin B-6 status but were not predictive of the onset of EEG changes. No detectable alterations in oral or periodontal status were found, nor did plaque flora change markedly. This study is the first report of EEG changes occurring in women undergoing vitamin B-6 depletion and the first report to document EEG changes in adults within 12 d on a vitamin B-6-depletion regimen.\r"

During the final phase the subjects ingested 50 mg vitamin B-6/d. Fasting blood was collected at the end of each period. Vitamin B-6 depletion significantly decreased percentage and total number of lymphocytes, mitogenic responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes to T- and B-cell mitogens, and interleukin 2 production. These indices returned to BL values after the third vitamin B-6-repletion period, when the total vitamin B-6 intakes were 1.90 +/- 0.18 mg/d for women and 2.88 +/- 0.17 mg/d for men. Vitamin B-6 deficiency impairs in vitro indices of cell-mediated immunity in healthy elderly adults. This impairment is reversible by vitamin B-6 repletion.\r"

REE in GCR-cancer patients was not significantly different from REE in GI patients or H control subjects. Comparison of measured REE with predicted REE obtained from prediction equations may erroneously suggest that increased REE is a contributing factor in the development of cancer cachexia. No significant differences in REE were found when patients with liver metastases were compared with patients without metastases. There were no differences in REE between gastric and colorectal cancer patients. The decrease in energy expenditure, which normally occurs during starvation and weight loss in healthy men and women, could not be demonstrated in weight-losing, GCR-cancer patients. In conclusion, elevation of REE contributes little to the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia in GCR-cancer patients.\r"

Low sialylation state of TF now serves as an objective marker of chronic alcohol abuse. To investigate the pathophysiological significance of this finding in relation to hepatic siderosis, also commonly associated with chronic alcoholism, the authors have investigated the effect of ethanol on the uptake, binding, and desialylation of transferrin by isolated rat liver endothelium in vitro. In pulse-chase experiments, transferrin labeled with either 125I (protein-labeled) or 3H (sialic acid-labeled) was incubated with isolated, fractionated liver endothelium with and without ethanol, and the supernates were subjected to column chromatography using RCA120- agarose. Incubation of the endothelium with increasing concentrations of ethanol resulted in a progressive increase in the desialylation rate of transferrin which was maximal when 160 mM concentration of ethanol was used. These data indicate that ethanol significantly promotes the desialylation of transferrin by rat liver endothelium. The implications of these findings in the pathogenesis of hepatic siderosis of the alcoholic are discussed.\r"

By week seven, reverse T3 had decreased to almost baseline and remained not significantly changed from the baseline to 13 weeks. Serum thyroxine (T4) increased significantly by the first week in all patients, but by the third week had returned to baseline levels which persisted to 13 weeks. The free T4 index and free T4 concentrations showed the same increment at week one and then returned to baseline levels. There were no significant changes in serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations.

  ".W": "Hypercalcemia is a common complication of certain advanced malignancies and although not therapeutically difficult, its presence raises complex ethical issues. Treatment of this condition is most easily justified when the patient is not terminal, the benefits are tangible, and the patient agrees with therapy. Withholding treatment is defensible medically, legally, and morally when a terminal situation is present, when drawbacks exceed the benefits, and when an informed patient declines therapy. Hypercalcemia is one of a number of conditions of dying that can be controlled by the physician. The physician's decision to treat such a condition, in part, depends upon his or her view of a good death. Further study is needed to clarify and avoid those situations of dying which involve suffering. Physicians must begin this difficult analysis and dialogue if they are to fulfill their obligation to minimize suffering in all patients.\r"

The control group consisted of 1,047 randomly selected full-term children. Through various searches of the ophthalmic records from the period of 1981 to 1986 of Stockholm County, we found that 134 of the 528 premature children (25.4%) and 121 of the 1,047 full-term children (11.5%) had needed ophthalmic care for different reasons. The prevalence of ocular abnormalities was much higher in premature children than in full-term children: reduced visual acuity of 20/33 or worse in the best eye (21 of 528 [4.0%] and one of 1,047 [0.1%]); myopia (33 of 528 [6.3%] and 18 of 1,047 [1.8%]); anisometropia of 1 diopter or greater (31 of 528 [5.9%] and 15 of 1,047 [1.5%]); strabismus (52 of 528 [9.9%] and 22 of 1,047 [2.1%]); and nystagmus (13 of 528 [2.4%] and one of 1,047 [0.1%]). Children with birth weight less than 1,000 g had the highest rates of ocular abnormalities. We conclude that visual and oculomotor development of premature children should be carefully examined.\r"

We used magnetic resonance imaging to investigate this phenomenon in two patients, one with an overshoot and the other with an undershoot. Minimal vertical displacement of the lateral rectus muscle in relation to the orbit was noted both on upshoot and downshoot. The bridle-effect theory must be modified to account for this finding.\r"

The pupil was normal on one side, and there was no aberrant regeneration of the oculomotor nerve. We could find no evidence for a peripheral oculomotor nerve lesion. This demonstrates that congenital oculomotor nerve palsy can be caused by brainstem disease. Embryologically, basal ganglia and oculomotor nuclei develop at the same time, and the Edinger-Westphal nucleus develops later. Thus, pupil sparing does not exclude a central origin for congenital oculomotor nerve palsy.\r"

The blind spot was significantly larger in the glaucomatous eyes than in the normal eyes, which corresponded with a larger zone beta in the glaucomatous eyes. The intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head correlated to the size of the blind spot, which included the parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy and a significant size difference between normal and glaucomatous eyes.\r"

A single reviewer analyzed, in masked fashion, the visual field tests of each patient and decided whether or not visual field defects were present mainly in the inferior half of the visual field. Of the 110 nondiabetic patients, 40 (36.4%) had visual field defects located mainly in the inferior half of the visual field in one or both eyes, whereas 56 of the 87 (64.4%) diabetic patients had such defects. This difference was statistically significant (P = .0001).

This effect was reduced but not eliminated with higher power levels. The Nd:YAG laser caused complete disruption and dispersal of the pigment epithelium with a single pulse of energy. Additionally, a multiple focal point configuration of the Nd:YAG laser was observed to produce a significantly larger iridotomy than a single focal point configuration for comparable energy settings. These observations may in part explain the observed clinical advantage of the Nd:YAG laser over the argon laser for creation of a patent iridotomy.\r"

Forty eyes of 38 patients were observed for at least six months, and the mean follow-up period was 46 months. Intraoperative complications occurred in four of 48 eyes (8%) and included retinal incarceration (two eyes), choroidal hemorrhage (one eye), and choroidal detachment (one eye). Three of the 40 eyes (7.5%) followed up for more than six months developed a recurrent retinal detachment and underwent a revision of the scleral buckle. At the last follow-up examination, the retinas of all 40 eyes were totally reattached. Final visual acuity of 20/40 or better was attained in 26 of 40 eyes (65%). Because of the low rate of intraoperative complications and the high rate of success, scleral buckling is recommended for most patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachments associated with severe myopia.\r"

Questions involved the indications for beginning treatment, choice of antiparasitic/antimicrobial agents, and experience with treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis in special situations including pregnancy, neonatal infections, and immunocompromised patients. Most of the respondents treat patients whose visual acuity had decreased to worse than 20/200, lesions located in the peripapillary, perifoveal, or maculopapillary bundle regions, and lesions associated with severe vitreous inflammation. Most would not treat patients who retained visual acuity of 20/20, lesions located in the far peripheral retina, or lesions associated with only trace to mild vitreous inflammation. Treatment of other combinations of factors remains controversial. Eight different antimicrobial drugs are used in various combinations for lesions threatening the macula or optic nerve head. Systemic corticosteroids are used by 59 of 62 respondents (95%) as part of their initial treatment regimen. The most commonly used regimens are pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine/corticosteroids (20 of 62 [32%]) and pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine/clindamycin/corticosteroids (17 of 62 [27%]). Adjunctive therapies (photocoagulation, cryotherapy, or vitrectomy) have been used by 20 of 60 respondents (33%). Most alter treatment during pregnancy, in newborn patients, and in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

We used a technique with the cannulated extrusion needle that detects the presence of the posterior cortical vitreous and facilitates safe removal of this layer from the retina.

On average, these patients had significantly smaller visual field areas and smaller electroretinogram amplitudes than 140 unrelated patients of comparable age with dominant retinitis pigmentosa without this mutation.

Capsulorhexis of various sizes (2.5 to 7.5 mm) were performed in 50 eyes obtained post mortem from 31 patients. The nucleus and cortex were removed by either phacoemulsification (35 eyes) or manual extracapsular cataract extraction (15 eyes). The opening of the capsule was then gradually enlarged, using a modified caliper with two pins attached to its tips, until the margins were torn. The capsule was torn when the circumference at the time of rupture was 1.6 times larger than the circumference of the original circular capsulectomy or 5.0 times larger than the diameter of the capsulectomy. Manual extraction of a lens nucleus with profile circumference (sagittal or anteroposterior) of 18.0 to 22.0 mm can be performed through a 5.5-mm opening and a 6.0- to 7.0-mm optic intraocular lens (profile circumference of 13.0 to 17.0 mm) can be implanted through a 4.5-mm capsulectomy.\r"

In one patient, the correct diagnosis of extraocular extension was demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging when both clinical and ultrasonographic data were not diagnostic. In another case, an extremely small area of extraocular extension was detected with ultrasound evaluation but was not noted on magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging is highly reliable in the detection of intraocular tumors. In pigmented uveal melanomas it is both sensitive and highly specific. In amelanotic processes magnetic resonance imaging can identify a mass but cannot always adequately characterize it. Further experience will be necessary to determine the proper role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of uveal tumors.\r"

  ".W": "In a double-blinded, randomized, prospective multi-center study of 695 women, we investigated whether epidural injection of sufentanil added to 0.125% bupivacaine with epinephrine (1:800,000) reduces the total amount of local anesthetic required, resulting in less motor blockade and reduced incidence of instrumental deliveries, and improves the quality of analgesia provided by this low concentration of local anesthetic without jeopardizing the safety of the baby. In addition, other potential benefits of sufentanil (such as decrease in the incidence of shivering) and side effects were examined. It was found that adding incremental doses of 10 micrograms sufentanil up to a maximum of 30 micrograms reduced the incidence of instrumental deliveries from 36 to 24% (P less than 0.01) and significantly improved quality and duration of analgesia without depressing the neurobehavioral status of the baby. No other benefits from adding sufentanil were found. The only side effect that occurred more frequently after sufentanil was pruritus. We conclude that epidural injection of 10-30 micrograms sufentanil added to 0.125% bupivacaine with epinephrine (1:800,000) improved the quality of analgesia during labor and reduced the incidence of instrumental deliveries without jeopardizing the safety of the baby.\r"

Vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg was administered as an intravenous (iv) bolus to all patients, and the evoked mechanical response to train-of-four stimulation was recorded. Five hypothermic and five normothermic patients were allowed to recover spontaneously. In the remaining five in each group, neostigmine (40 micrograms/kg) and atropine (20 micrograms/kg) was administered when the first twitch (T1) height spontaneously recovered to 10% of control (T1 = 10% of the pre-vecuronium twitch tension). Vecuronium's duration of action (from injection of drug until T1 = 10%) was 28 +/- 4 and 62 +/- 8 min during normothermia and hypothermia, respectively (P less than 0.05). The corresponding values for spontaneous recovery from T1 = 10% to TOF ratio greater than 75% were 37 +/- 15 and 80 +/- 24 min (P less than 0.05), and for neostigmine-induced recovery were 10 +/- 3 and 16 +/- 11 min (difference not significant).

To test the linearity of the system, a model of the larynx consisting of a syringe barrel was constructed, and weights were applied to two bands of tissue simulating the vocal cords. Tests on Mallinckrodt size-7.5 tubes showed that the pressure increase produced by a given force was independent of baseline pressure in the range 10-30 mmHg. In addition, the pressure inside the inflatable cuff was linear with increasing weight (or force) for a baseline pressure of 10 mmHg. Thirty ASA physical status 1 or 2 adults were anesthetized with propofol and fentanyl. Tracheal intubation was performed in the absence of muscle relaxants, and the inflatable cuff of the tracheal tube was positioned between the vocal cords. Pressure inside the cuff was measured with an air-filled transducer. Stimulation was produced at different sites along the course of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. A surface electrode placed over the notch of the thyroid cartilage produced consistent adduction of the cords, measured as an increase of 8.9 +/- 5.1 mmHg (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) in the cuff pressure. Neuromuscular blocking drugs produced train-of-four fade, and large doses abolished the response completely, ruling out direct muscle stimulation. It is concluded that this assembly can provide useful information on intrinsic laryngeal muscle function.\r"

  ".U": "91214023\r", 
  ".W": "Whether isoflurane has the potential to produce coronary artery steal and associated myocardial ischemia is still controversial. Previous studies addressing this issue in humans did not purposefully control hemodynamics or use continuous measures of myocardial ischemia. The authors used transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and continuous Holter electrocardiography (ECG) to study the relative risk of myocardial ischemia during isoflurane or sufentanil anesthesia under strict control of hemodynamics in 186 high-risk patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Overall, hemodynamics were well controlled (increased heart rate = 9.8%; increased systolic blood pressure = 7.1%; decreased systolic blood pressure = 10.8% of total prebypass time compared with preoperative baseline values), with no difference between the two anesthetics. In the 162 patients with interpretable TEE recordings, moderate to severe TEE ischemic episodes (grade change greater than or equal to 2) developed in 33 (21%) during the prebypass period, with no difference between isoflurane (12 of 56 = 21%) and sufentanil (21 of 106 = 20%) (P = 0.97). The duration and severity of TEE episodes were not significantly different between the two groups. No correlation was observed between TEE ischemic episodes and isoflurane concentrations (range 0.47-1.75%). In the 181 patients with interpretable ECG recordings, ECG evidence of ischemia developed in 34 (19%) during the prebypass period, with no difference between isoflurane (12 of 59 = 20%) and sufentanil (22 of 122 = 18%) (P = 0.87). The duration and severity of electrocardiographic ischemic episodes were also similar in patients receiving either isoflurane or sufentanil. Four of the 62 patients (6%) who received isoflurane had an adverse cardiac outcome versus 15 of 124 patients (12%) who received sufentanil (P = 0.34). The authors' findings demonstrate that, when hemodynamics are controlled, the incidence of myocardial ischemia (TEE or ECG) during isoflurane and sufentanil anesthesia is similar.\r"

  ".W": "Perioperative myocardial ischemia is associated with an increased risk of perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI). Several attempts have been made to define intraoperative hemodynamic predictors of myocardial ischemia. In a canine preparation with coronary stenosis, a pressure rate quotient (PRQ = mean arterial pressure/heart rate) less than one (PRQ less than 1) indicated subendocardial myocardial ischemia. The authors tested this hypothesis in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG), using electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-segment changes (leads II/V5) to diagnose myocardial ischemia. Sixty (n = 60) patients having CABG surgery were prospectively studied before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Calibrated ECG leads II and V5 (diagnostic mode) were monitored continuously and recorded with the use of a Hewlett-Packard computer ST-segment analyzer. In addition, arterial and pulmonary artery pressures were monitored. Ischemia was defined as new-onset ST deviation (greater than or equal to 1 mm from the baseline ECG). ECG and hemodynamic data were stored at 2-min intervals for subsequent computer analysis. Serial creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) X MB (%) determinations and 12-lead ECGs were collected for the initial 3 postoperative days. Of the 3,463 intervals (2 min) available for study, 3,322 (96%) were satisfactorily recorded for 60 patients. Ischemia occurred during 65 intervals in 9 patients (9 of 60), of which only 34% (22 of 65) were associated with a PRQ less than 1 (P less than 0.01). In contrast, there were 466 intervals during which PRQ was less than 1, but without ECG evidence of ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A commercially available TAP pulse generator supplied 10-ms pulses with current variable between 0 and 40 mA. Pacing distances (in centimeters) were measured from the infraalveolar ridge to midway between PES electrodes (1.5-cm interelectrode distance). Pacing thresholds (milliamperes) were measured at the point of a maximum-amplitude P-wave (PMAX) in the bipolar esophageal electrogram and points 1 cm proximal or 1, 2, or 3 cm distal to PMAX. TAP (70-100 beats per min) was used for sinus bradycardia less than or equal to 60 beats per min (36 patients) or atrioventricular (AV) junctional rhythm (2 patients) and blood pressure changes with TAP documented. In male patients (n = 49), PMAX was 32.7 +/- 0.3 cm (mean +/- SE) and minimum pacing threshold 5.1 +/- 0.4 mA (range, 1-13 mA) at 33.6 +/- 0.3 cm (range, 30-37 cm). In female patients (n = 51), PMAX was 30.4 +/- 0.4 cm and minimum pacing threshold 4.4 +/- 0.4 mA (range, 2-14 mA) at 31.1 +/- 0.4 cm (range, 26-40 cm). TAP produced an average 13-16 mmHg increase in systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial pressure in patients with sinus bradycardia or AV junctional rhythm. There were no subjective patient complaints (epigastric discomfort, dysphagia) that could be attributed to TAP; objective evaluation (esophagoscopy) was not performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance, respectively. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and isoflurane. Hypotension was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg. GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during hypotension. Postoperatively, ERPF returned to preoperative values, whereas GFR was higher than preoperative values. Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when hypotension was induced, allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow. We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during isoflurane-induced hypotension and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed.\r"

Measurements were taken at baseline, during infusion immediately before and after the onset of amnesia, immediately at end of infusion, and 0.5 and 1.5 h after infusion. All subjects had onset of amnesia during infusion, were completely amnesic by the end of infusion, partially amnesic 0.5 h after infusion, and had complete recall by 1.5 h after infusion. The EEG beta power increased and alpha power decreased during amnesic periods. The beta 1/alpha power ratio was the parameter most specific for amnesia. From a baseline value of 0.20 +/- 0.05 (standard error of the mean [SEM]), it increased to 0.96 +/- 0.26 at the end of infusion and decreased to 0.61 +/- 0.15 0.5 h after infusion. By 1.5 h after infusion, all EEG parameters had returned to baseline values. Beta power changes associated with midazolam amnesia were most pronounced in the Fz and Cz lead positions, and alpha power changes were most pronounced in the Oz position. We conclude that 1) EEG power values, particularly the beta 1/alpha ratio, can identify periods of amnesia after midazolam infusion; 2) specific EEG changes and the presence of amnesia vary with the probable serum concentration of midazolam; and 3) the characteristic EEG pattern during partial or complete amnesia varies as one moves across the cerebral cortex.\r"

Cutaneous heat loss was measured using 10 area-weighted thermal flux transducers while volunteers were exposed to a 20.6 degrees C environment for 1 h. Heat loss decreased significantly from 100 +/- 3 W during the control periods to 69 +/- 6 W (average of all covers) after 1 h of treatment. Heat losses from volunteers insulated by the Thermadrape (61 +/- 6 W) and Bair Hugger covers (64 +/- 5 W) were significantly less than losses from those insulated by plastic bags (77 +/- 11 W). The paper drape (67 +/- 7 W) provided slightly, but not significantly, better insulation than the cloth drape (70 +/- 4 W). Coverage by prewarmed cotton blankets initially resulted in the least heat loss (58 +/- 8 W), but after 40 min, resulted in heat loss significantly greater than that for the Thermadrape (71 +/- 7 W). Regional heat loss was roughly proportional to surface area, and the distribution of regional heat loss remained similar with all covers. These data suggest that cost and convenience should be major factors when choosing among passive perioperative insulating covers. It is likely that the amount of skin surface covered is more important than the choice of skin region covered or the choice of insulating material.\r"

  ".W": "Ketamine is a cardiovascular stimulant through its sympathomimetic effects; however, its direct inotropic effect has been reported as positive in rat and negative in rabbit ventricular myocardium. This study reexamines the effect of ketamine on the contractile properties of mammalian ventricular myocardium. In isolated, electrically stimulated ferret right ventricular papillary muscles, the authors assessed the inotropic effect of ketamine (10(-6) M to 3 x 10(-4) M in 0.5 log M increments) alone and in various pharmacologic conditions designed to delineate ketamine's site(s) of action. Ketamine exerted a positive inotropic effect that was maximal at 10(-4) M. Bupranolol (10(-7) M) abolished this positive inotropic effect, whereas phentolamine (10(-6) M) did not. Depletion of norepinephrine stores by reserpine also eliminated ketamine's positive inotropic effect, indicating that ketamine caused indirect activation of the beta-adrenoceptor. Ketamine did not exert a positive inotropic effect in the presence of simultaneous inhibition of neuronal norepinephrine uptake with desmethylimipramine (DMI) (5 x 10(-6) M) and extraneuronal uptake with corticosterone (5 x 10(-5) M). It is likely that ketamine's action is to inhibit norepinephrine uptake at the neuroeffector junction rather than to augment norepinephrine release. In the presence of corticosterone, ketamine exerted a smaller positive inotropic effect than that seen with ketamine alone. Ketamine produced a small increase in force development in the presence of DMI, but this did not reach statistical significance. Inhibition of neuronal catecholamine uptake appears to be the predominant mechanism of ketamine's positive inotropic effect.\r"

Recently, it has been suggested that the burst suppression pattern seen in dogs given moderately high doses (2.0 MAC) of desflurane may spontaneously subside. This observation suggests the development of acute tolerance to at least some of the anesthetic effects of this drug. No other volatile anesthetic has been found to produce acute tolerance. We attempted to replicate these findings in domestic swine. Five juvenile swine (25-30 kg) were anesthetized with desflurane in oxygen and during normocapnia were exposed to two doses of desflurane sufficient to induce burst suppression (1.5 and 1.7 MAC) for 35 min at each dose, with a period of EEG recovery (0.6 MAC) before, between (in 3 of 5 animals), and after the high doses. Frontoparietal EEG was continuously recorded and the burst suppression ratio continuously calculated. Suppression was more complete at 1.7 MAC than at 1.5 MAC (98.24 +/- 1.75 vs. 90.80 +/- 3.05%, respectively, mean +/- standard deviation). The degree of burst suppression activity did not change over time at either 1.5 (P greater than 0.33) or 1.7 MAC desflurane (P greater than 0.41). There was no EEG evidence of tolerance to desflurane anesthesia in swine.\r"

In all three age groups, action potential overshoot and the maximum rate of increase of phase 0 (Vmax) were significantly reduced by bupivacaine greater than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. Bupivacaine 1.5 micrograms/ml reduced action potential duration at both 50% and 100% repolarization in the fetal tissues, but not in adult or neonatal tissues. Tonic block was not induced by bupivacaine in any of the three groups. Use-dependent block was variable at bupivacaine 0.2 micrograms/ml in all three groups and was consistent and equivalent at higher concentrations. The onset and offset of use-dependent block were the same in all three groups, with onset occurring between 6.0 and 6.7 beats and the time constant for recovery being 1.9-2.3 s. The authors conclude there is an age-related bupivacaine effect on action potential duration but no age-related change in bupivacaine-induced use-dependent block.\r"

Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to systematically examine the effects of desflurane on myocardial contractile function and compare these actions to equianesthetic concentrations of isoflurane in chronically instrumented dogs. Contractility was evaluated using an established index of inotropic state, the preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW) versus end-diastolic segment length (EDL) relationship. Since autonomic nervous system tone may influence the hemodynamic effects of the volatile anesthetics in vivo, experiments were performed in the presence of pharmacologic blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Two groups of experiments were performed with seven dogs instrumented for measurement of aortic and left ventricular pressure, the maximum rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt), subendocardial segment length, coronary blood flow velocity, and cardiac output. After autonomic nervous system blockade, ventricular pressure-segment length loops were generated using preload reduction via partial inferior vena caval occlusion. The PRSW versus EDL relation was calculated from the pressure-length loops. Dogs were then anesthetized with 1.0 or 1.5 MAC desflurane or isoflurane in a random fashion, and measurements were repeated after 30 min of equilibration at each anesthetic concentration. The PRSW versus EDL slope reflected similar changes in contractile state when desflurane or isoflurane was administered (53 +/- 4 during control to 26 +/- 4 erg.cm-2 x 10(-3).mm-1 at 1.5 MAC desflurane, and 57 +/- 5 during control to 31 +/- 3 erg.cm-2 x 10(-2).mm-1 at 1.5 MAC isoflurane). In conclusion, desflurane and isoflurane produced equivalent direct decreases in myocardial contractility.\r"

HD1 caused significant (P less than 0.05) increases in cardiac output and all splanchnic flows. Only hepatic arterial blood flow increased twice as much as did cardiac output. Except for hepatic arterial O2 delivery, all splanchnic O2 deliveries decreased. Splanchnic O2 extractions increased, and O2 uptakes remained unchanged. There were no changes in mean surface PO2 values or in surface PO2 histograms of liver and small intestine; in portal or hepatic venous pH; and in hepatic uptake of pyruvate and lactate. In contrast, during HD2 (despite further increases in flows and O2 extractions) portal and hepatic venous pH decreased; mean surface PO2 of liver and small intestine decreased; and the liver surface PO2 histogram showed broadening and a shift to the left. However, hepatic uptake of lactate and pyruvate, and splanchnic O2 uptake remained unchanged, and histologic examination did not reveal significant cell injury. These data indicate that in this experimental model limited acute normovolemic HD was well tolerated by the splanchnic organs. After severe HD, gross liver function remained intact, but there was evidence that compensatory mechanisms (increases in flow and O2 extractions) were no longer fully able to counteract the decrease in splanchnic O2 delivery.\r"

Cells were dialyzed with pipette solution containing CsCl and superfused with an external solution containing 10 mM BaCl2 and tetraethylammonium chloride. The long-lasting (L) and transient (T)-type Ca2+ channel currents were measured by depolarizing the membrane from different holding potentials (HPs). Voltage steps from an HP of either -80 or -70 mV elicited a low threshold, rapidly inactivating inward current at -40 to -30 mV, which maximally activated at -14 +/- 0.9 mV. This current was reduced by Ni2+ (100 microM) but not by nifedipine (1 microM), therefore resembling T-type Ca2+ channel current. In contrast, depolarizing steps from an HP of -40 mV elicited a sustained inward current that maximally activated at +4.1 +/- 0.8 mV and was nifedipine-sensitive, showing the characteristics of an L-type Ca2+ channel current. Halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane produced a concentration-dependent suppression of total Ca2+ channel current in every cell studied. Separation of Ca2+ channel types showed that both L- and T-type Ca2+ channel currents were depressed to a similar extent by anesthetic administration. These agents reduced peak L- and T-type current elicited at each pulse potential but did not shift the current-voltage (I-V) relationship for either T- or L-type current activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After determination of prepregnant baseline values, one group of rats (n = 35) was mated and retested on days 7 and 21 of gestation and 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after parturition. After baseline determinations on day 21 and postpartum day 1, the animals received a subcutaneous injection of naloxone 1.0 mg/kg and were retested. A nonpregnant control group of animals (n = 7) was tested in the same manner. On day 21 of gestation and postpartum days 1 and 3, significant changes (higher threshold or longer latency to response) were observed after all but the writhing test. High-dose naloxone (1.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced the increases observed on day 21 and post-partum day 1. Nonpregnant rats demonstrated no significant change on any test day. The second part of the study evaluated a possible influence of low-dose naloxone on pregnancy-induced analgesia to visceral stimulation (colorectal distention) in another group of pregnant rats (n = 44). The significant increase in threshold on day 21 of gestation was not changed by intravenous (i.v.) naloxone 1.0, 2.3, or 3.0 micrograms/kg, whereas 5.0 and 20.0 micrograms/kg naloxone significantly decreased the observed pregnancy-induced analgesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The current study examined effects of analgesic concentrations of lidocaine on injury-induced discharge of A-delta and C fibers, using the in vitro rabbit corneal nerve preparation. Lidocaine at concentrations from 1-20 micrograms/ml reversibly suppressed tonic action potential discharge of acutely injured nerves. The median effective concentration (ED50) (5.7 micrograms/ml) corresponds to clinically effective plasma concentrations for analgesia. Electrically evoked nerve conduction was not blocked until lidocaine concentrations were greater than 250 micrograms/ml. Thus, analgesia produced by lidocaine appears to result from suppression of tonic neural discharge in injured peripheral A-delta and C fiber nociceptors.\r"

Volumetric measures were obtained with a validated computerized algorithm for segmentation of cranial volume into brain tissue and central and peripheral cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with high inter-operator reliability. Patients did not differ significantly in whole-brain volume, but had higher whole-brain CSF volume and higher ratios of ventricular and sulcal CSF to cranial volume. Covarying age and education did not affect the differences. However, there was considerable overlap both in CSF volumes and in volume-cranium ratios, and most patients were within the normal range. This suggests that anatomic changes reflected in CSF can provide a limited substrate for schizophrenia and may apply only to subpopulations. Although there was no gender x diagnosis interaction, the results for sulcal CSF were significant only for men, whereas for women, the ventricular ratios were marginally higher in patients.\r"

  ".W": "In a continuing quantitative study of hippocampal cell orientation in schizophrenic subjects and nonschizophrenic control subjects, a pattern of right hemispheric cell disorganization in schizophrenic subjects, as robust as that previously described in the left hemisphere, was shown. The study was based on tissue from 11 schizophrenic and seven approximately age-matched control subjects from a Veterans Administration Medical Center. Using a new measuring technique that proved complementary and superior to the method formerly used, we determined the axes of orientation for approximately 10,800 neurons. A significant difference in cell disorganization was found between schizophrenic and control subjects. From separate analyses of the interface zones among the various hippocampal cell sectors, this difference was found to be significant at the interfaces between cornu ammonis zones 1 and 2 and zones 2 and 3. Analysis of the pattern of disorganization numbers suggests a bimodal distribution in which the cell orientation values of one group of schizophrenic subjects overlap those of the nonschizophrenic control group, while the cell orientation values of a second group significantly exceed those of the control population. Although some recent studies have suggested that schizophrenia may be related exclusively to the left hemisphere, the results of this study indicate that schizophrenia-related structural changes involve the right hemisphere as well. Thus, schizophrenia may be a bilateral rather than unilateral disorder.\r"

However, the model failed to identify any of the patients who committed suicide.

Depressed alcoholics also had significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid and of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Among subgroups of depressed alcoholics, secondary compared with primary depressives were more often divorced, of lower social status, with an earlier onset of alcoholism, and higher Michigan Alcohol Screening Test scores. Secondary depressives also had significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of homovanillic acid than never depressed alcoholics. These results suggest that certain psychosocial variables, alcohol consumption, and neurochemical variables may be specifically associated with depression in alcoholics.\r"

We examined the validity and other characteristics of these items in 137 patients in pure alcohol withdrawal using the reliable and valid Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol. The DSM-III-R items of hand tremor amplitude, nausea or vomiting, headache, transient hallucinations, autonomic hyperactivity (increased pulse or sweating), and anxiety correlated significantly with total score and significantly indicated clinical severity. Addition of an \"agitation\" item improved the correlation. The diagnostic accuracy is greater than 95% if any two or more items are present. The number of positive items, of which tremor can be one, to grade clinical severity shows that a score of 2 indicates \"very mild\"; 3, \"mild\"; 4, \"moderate\"; and 5, \"severe.\". We propose that an Alcohol Withdrawal Diagnostic Inventory and a DSM-III-R-compatible brief Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol are useful for clinical research, where graded symptom characterization is needed. Our data may be helpful in the development of criteria for DSM-IV.\r"

A gradual taper (25% per week reduction) off benzodiazepine therapy was then attempted. Five weeks after taper, significantly more patients who had received carbamazepine than placebo remained benzodiazepine free, this despite the fact that no statistically significant differences in withdrawal severity could be demonstrated. Patients receiving carbamazepine reported a larger reduction in withdrawal severity than patients receiving placebo, but only at a trend level, and only on the daily patient-rated withdrawal checklist. Eleven patients (28%) required antidepressant therapy for depression or panic when assessed at 12-weeks follow-up. The results of this pilot investigation suggest that carbamazepine might have promise as an adjunctive drug therapy for the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, particularly in patients receiving benzodiazepines in daily dosages of 20 mg/d or greater of diazepam equivalents.\r"

Resting metabolic rate, adjusted for differences in lean body mass, was significantly lower in bulimics (mean +/- SE, 4201 +/- 126 kJ/d) than healthy volunteers (4694 +/- 172 kJ/d). Bulimic patients had a blunted increase in oxygen consumption in response to low and moderate levels of exercise (421 +/- 16 and 689 +/- 17 mL/min) compared with values for healthy volunteers (491 +/- 28 and 795 +/- 26 mL/min). Plasma triiodothyronine (1.1 +/- 0.07 vs 1.4 +/- 0.08 nmol/L) levels, plasma norepinephrine levels in supine (0.58 +/- 0.04 vs 1.06 +/-0.17 nmol/L) and standing (1.34 +/- 0.15 vs 2.46 +/- 0.30 nmol/L) subjects, and the increase in norepinephrine levels during orthostatic challenge (0.76 +/- 0.15 vs 1.40 +/- 0.25 nmol/L) all were significantly less in bulimics than volunteers. These results are consistent with previous reports of decreased energy requirements for weight maintenance and decreased plasma levels of metabolism-related hormones in patients with bulimia. However, the effects of reduced energy intake in metabolic studies of patients with bulimia need to be further investigated.\r"

Seventy-five patients who met strict diagnostic criteria were treated with either cognitive behavior therapy, a simplified behavioral version of this treatment, or interpersonal psychotherapy. Assessment was by interview and self-report questionnaire, and many aspects of functioning were evaluated. All three treatments resulted in an improvement in the measures of the psychopathology. Cognitive behavior therapy was more effective than interpersonal psychotherapy in modifying the disturbed attitudes to shape and weight, extreme attempts to diet, and self-induced vomiting. Cognitive behavior therapy was more effective than behavior therapy in modifying the disturbed attitudes to shape and weight and extreme dieting, but it was equivalent in other respects. The findings suggest that cognitive behavior therapy, when applied to patients with bulimia nervosa, operates through mechanisms specific to this treatment and is more effective than both interpersonal psychotherapy and a simplified behavioral version of cognitive behavior therapy.\r"

Rates of most specific psychiatric disorders were comparably higher for respondents meeting poverty criteria compared with those not in poverty, although these differences were not always statistically significant. The effects of poverty did not differ by sex, age, race, or history of psychiatric episodes.\r"

Using interview data from a household sample in Los Angeles, we found that the uninsured had a higher prevalence of serious psychiatric disorder (16%) than those with private health insurance (12%), but had a prevalence similar to those with Medicaid (18%). Access to mental health services among those with a psychiatric disorder was similar in the uninsured (14.5%) and those with private insurance (18%) but was less than those with Medicaid coverage (42%). These results indicate that the uninsured have a great potential need for mental health services and that access might be improved through insurance plans such as Medicaid. However, further study is needed to determine the adequacy and quality of services provided under Medicaid and whether such a plan would improve access for an uninsured population such as the one studied here.\r"

Currently (1989 surveys), the accuracies for disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration antimicrobial susceptibility testing were 98.2% and 96.1%, respectively. Disk diffusion testing has recently (since 1986) become more popular, along with rapid automated systems, such as the AMS-Vitek System (St Louis, Mo). Rapid tests for beta-lactamase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase have performed well. Quality control procedures have switched to a cost-effective weekly frequency pattern for nearly 70% of laboratories. Some antimicrobial susceptibility testing problems still exist among anaerobic bacterial methods, procedures for fastidious organisms (Haemophilus, Streptococcus species, Moraxella, pneumococci, gonococci), tests for oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, and the methods for use against nonenteric gram-negative or gram-positive bacilli. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing users subscribing to the College of American Pathologists surveys should strictly follow the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards interpretive and quality control criteria to assure the best performance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act, 1988, compliant College of American Pathologists proficiency sample program.\r"

Because of real or perceived financial barriers to access, these uninsured usually had more expensive, acute, and episodic care that resulted in the shifting of cost to the insured and in higher health care costs. After studying the problem for 6 months, the commission made specific recommendations that if fully implemented, would ensure access to health care for virtually all uninsured Oregonians. The recommendations support existing medical and insurance systems, foster public and private partnerships, and provide for the leveraging of federal Medicaid dollars in a favorable ratio to the state. The implementation of these recommendations should ultimately reduce costs and at the same time provide more care.\r"

A related virus, HTLV type II (HTLV-II), has been isolated from patients with hairy-cell leukemia, but it has not been proved to be the cause of any disease. In late 1988, US blood banks began screening all blood donations for antibodies to HTLV-I/II. This program has resulted in the identification of many unexpectedly seropositive blood donors and provided much information about the prevalence of HTLV-I/II in the United States. In this article, I review the replication of these agents, as well as their pathogenesis, diagnosis, and mechanisms of spread.\r"

Because antigen assays, unlike cell culture, cannot amplify low levels of the virus to a detectable level, assay sensitivity is especially dependent on high-quality specimens. In addition, the assays are unable to detect other viruses or bacteria with which the patient may be infected. This review summarizes results from clinical studies of the performance of cell cultures and the more commonly used antigen assays, describes factors that may lead to false-positive or false-negative test results, and makes recommendations for the selection of procedures for the reliable detection of microbial pathogens from patients suspected of being infected with respiratory syncytial virus.\r"

Patients who receive infusions of IVIgG may test false-positive for a variety of viral, bacterial, and other infectious diseases when serologic determinations are performed on their blood samples. It is important that laboratories performing serologic testing be aware that patients have been infused with IVIgG, so that spurious laboratory results can be identified. Serologic testing on implicated lots of IVIgG and on the patient's pretreatment sample may aid in correctly identifying a spurious serologic result due to therapy with IVIgG.\r"

Both patients were young adult men who presented with fever, pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Both had prompt symptomatic and hematologic improvement following splenectomy. Severe constitutional symptoms recurred in one patient 1 month after splenectomy, and he died of septicemia 2 months later. In both cases, there was prominent hemophagocytosis in the splenic red pulp. Some hemophagocytosis was also noted in the liver from the fatal case. Unexpectedly, no hemophagocytosis was detected in the bone marrow biopsy specimens or marrow aspirates obtained from these patients. The DNA hybridization studies detected Epstein-Barr virus genomes in spleen samples from both patients, and both patients had atypical patterns of serologic response to the virus, suggesting that a defective immune response may lead to an unrestrained viral proliferation. We conclude that there is an association between chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection and the hemophagocytic syndrome, but that the tissue distribution of the hemophagocytosis may be variable.\r"

Our results indicated that the BM findings in primary thrombocythemia were quite similar to those in polycythemia vera and chronic granulocytic leukemia with associated extreme thrombocytosis. However, statistically significant differences between the BM findings in myeloproliferative disorders and extreme reactive thrombocytosis were found in the numbers of megakaryocytes, presence or absence of megakaryocyte clusters, stainable iron, cellularity, and reticulin content. We concluded that BM examination is a useful procedure as an aid in determining the cause of extreme thrombocytosis.\r"

Although the characteristic change was more likely to be found in entirely than partially submitted specimens, the difference was not statistically significant. There was a direct relationship between neovascularization and the duration of symptoms. The frequency of finding the specific change increased from 12.5% in patients with disease for less than a month to 82% of patients who had symptoms for 6 months or more. Specific changes in prolapsed disks probably reflect a reparative phenomenon that is influenced by the degree and duration of mechanical forces.\r"

An absence of sustentacular cells was demonstrated in the majority of malignant cases, while the locally aggressive or recurrent group usually contained an abundance of these cells. However, in one malignant case a constant moderate number of sustentacular cells in the primary site and in two sequential metastases was found. We conclude that the absence of sustentacular cells in pheochromocytomas may indicate a lesion with a greater potential for metastasis and that sustentacular cells, when they are present in a malignant pheochromocytoma, are an integral part of the tumor.\r"

By the use of botrocetin (venom coagglutinin), both quantitative and semiquantitative assays for GP-Ib activity were developed. The latter assay uses limiting dilutions of botrocetin as a measure of GP-Ib activity. Platelets, stored up to 23 days under blood bank conditions, were assayed by the limiting dilution test. Values of GP-Ib were progressively diminished after 9 to 10 days of storage, reaching levels of less than 10% at 23 days. Platelets from a subject with Bernard-Soulier syndrome showed less than 10% GP-Ib activity. These assays appear to be a specific measure of functional GP-Ib activity, and, when combined with GP-Ib antigen measurement by other methods, they provide a means for further characterizing GP-Ib abnormalities.\r"

A variety of medical complications, including sudden death, are known to occur in the adult-user population, regardless of the route of cocaine administration. We report 16 cases of infant death registered by the Philadelphia (Pa) Medical Examiner's Office over a 2-year period (1987 through 1989), where toxicologic analyses revealed the presence of cocaine and/or its metabolite, benzoylecgonine. Scene investigation documented that these infants, shortly before death, had been exposed to environments that contained the smoke from crack. We conclude that the route of cocaine administration in this infant population was the passive inhalation of crack smoke. It is possible that the cocaine may have contributed to the death of these infants. Thus, in addition to the adult users, infants and children exposed to environments where crack is smoked may inhale cocaine and potentially suffer from its adverse effects.\r"

Tumors included three lung carcinomas, one pulmonary carcinoid tumor, two lymphomas, five extrapulmonary carcinomas, and one mediastinal ganglioneuroma. Two malignant neoplasms developed in each of two patients. Six tumors preceded, three followed, and three occurred concomitantly with the diagnosis of PEG. Slides from eight PEG-associated tumors and 18 control neoplasms from patients without PEG were also stained immunohistochemically for S100 protein.

Our study suggests, but does not prove, that there may be more than a random association between PEG and neoplasms. Cigarette smoking, moreover, is an important risk factor for both PEG and lung carcinomas. Our immunohistochemical findings indicate that S100 protein-positive cells in tumors usually bear little or no relationship to PEG. In patients with an underlying malignant neoplasm, PEG simulates pulmonary metastases clinically and, occasionally, histopathologically.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the autopsy records of 261 patients with breast carcinoma, who died at The Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, for the presence of metastases to the central nervous system, particularly for the presence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Metastases to the central nervous system were found in 41 (18.1%) of 226 patients who had metastatic cancer. In 24 cases (10.6%), metastases were seen in brain parenchyma; in 11 cases (4.9%), only dura mater was involved, and in six cases (2.6%), leptomeningeal carcinomatosis was found. All patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis showed some symptoms of central nervous system involvement while alive. The patients died between 2 weeks and 2 months after the onset of central nervous system symptoms. Four of six patients with such a complication presented with locally advanced or disseminated carcinoma on the first admission. With regard to histologic findings, three patients had infiltrating lobular carcinoma, two had infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and one had mixed infiltrating lobular and ductal carcinoma, with a metastasizing lobular component. Metastases to the brain parenchyma were found exclusively in infiltrating ductal carcinoma. We stress that infiltrating lobular carcinoma represents a distinctive type of breast cancer with an unusual propensity to disseminate into leptomeninges, as this occurred in almost 14% of all cases of infiltrating lobular carcinoma in our series in contrast to a 1% incidence in cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma.\r"

Postoperative complications included primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with several episodes of moderate acute rejection and severe pneumonia. Six months after transplantation, an endomyocardial biopsy specimen revealed focal necrotizing myocarditis with intranuclear inclusions consistent with CMV. The patient subsequently developed fulminant pneumonia and died 7 months after transplantation. Postmortem examination revealed that the cause of death was acute necrotizing bronchopneumonia due to Staphylococcus aureus, with underlying CMV pneumonitis. The transplanted heart had left ventricular hypertrophy with multiple organizing myocardial infarcts, moderate coronary atherosclerosis, and organizing thrombi of the left atrium. Characteristic inclusions of CMV were identified, predominantly within endothelial cells, in the left coronary artery, left ventricular endocardium, and myocardium. With in situ hybridization, the presence of CMV was verified in the inclusions, as well as in many fibroblasts without inclusions. In situ hybridization is warranted in myocardial biopsy specimens when suspicious inclusions or infiltrates are present, to confirm CMV infection, so that appropriate therapy can be initiated.\r"

The parasites were diagnosed as well-preserved, encysted Armillifer armillatus nymphs. Neither degenerative nor inflammatory granulomatous reactions were observed in the adjacent tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of human infection with encysted nymphs of A armillatus and the eighth reported case of pentastomiasis in North America.\r"

We report a case of typical phenotype and absent family history of kidney disease in a 15-year-old white girl (46,XX) who died of renal failure and massive cerebral hemorrhage. At necropsy, the kidneys were greatly enlarged but of fairly normal shape. The cortex was replaced by thin-walled spherical cysts, 0.5 to 2.0 cm in diameter; the majority of the smaller cysts were located deep in the cortex, and the medulla contained lesser numbers of larger cysts. No distal urinary tract obstruction was present. Microdissection revealed cysts and diverticula located in all segments of the nephrons and collecting ducts. Uninvolved nephrons showed diffuse hypertrophy. These findings were correlated with immunoperoxidase stains using peanut lectin, Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin, antibodies to cytokeratins, stage-specific embryonic antigen-1, Tamm-Horsfall protein, and epithelial membrane antigen. Other visceral anomalies included biliary cystadenomatous proliferation in the liver and pancreatic cysts. The renal changes are similar to those of autosomal dominant (adult-type) polycystic disease.\r"

In addition to areas of typical Brenner epithelium, the tumor displayed a component of transitional and squamous carcinoma that invaded the testicular parenchyma, epididymis, and vas deferens, and metastasized to periaortic lymph nodes. To our knowledge, there are only four previously described instances of testicular Brenner tumors. Our case appears to represent the first description of a malignant Brenner tumor of the testis and epididymis.\r"

The condition is usually confirmed by the presence of a microcytic anemia and elevated levels of Hbs S, F, and A2 by electrophoresis. However, other less common disorders of Hb structure and synthesis may exhibit laboratory findings that mimic Hb S/beta(+)-thalassemia but have a more favorable prognosis. We present a case occurring in a man with clinical and laboratory features that were suggestive of Hb S/beta(+)-thalassemia but with normocythemia. Although nonmicrocytic variants of beta(+)-thalassemia, including concomitant nutritional deficiencies, were considered, high-pressure liquid chromatography revealed nearly all of the patient's fetal Hb to contain only G gamma chains. This pattern is most consistent with the rate but clinically benign condition of Hb S/G gamma-beta(+)-hereditary persistence of fetal Hb, a nondeletional type of hereditary persistence of fetal Hb. We discuss a diagnostic approach to adult Hb A, F, and S conditions, including thalassemias and thalassemia-like syndromes.\r"
