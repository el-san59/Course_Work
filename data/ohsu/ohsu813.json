  ".W": "Although it is now accepted that cryopreserved semen must, on ethical and medicolegal grounds, be used for donor insemination many clinicians still believe that it has an unacceptably reduced fecundability rate as compared with fresh semen. We studied the outcome of 81 recipients who started therapeutic donor insemination (TDI) treatment during 1986 in a program that used exclusively cryopreserved semen; 55 had never undergone TDI and were receiving the first series (six cycles), 6 were receiving the second series (also six cycles), and 20 had achieved pregnancy through TDI previously and were starting the treatment again. Insemination with semen stored in 0.5-ml French straws was performed daily during the periovulatory period while the modified Insler score was 10 or greater out of 15. A total of 42 (52%) of the recipients became pregnant within six TDI cycles; 4 (10%) had a spontaneous abortion. An average of 4.8 straws were used per cycle among those who became pregnant and 5.1 per cycle among those who did not. On average 2.6 cycles were required to achieve pregnancy. The overall fecundability rate was 14.6%. We conclude that a TDI program involving exclusively frozen semen can be operated with a success rate comparable to rates achieved with fresh semen if a simple, established cryopreservation method and an uncomplicated clinical management protocol are used.\r"

However, it has been much more difficult to use computers in more physician-related activities of daily practice. I investigated the Desqview multitasking system on a 386 computer as a solution to this problem. Physician-directed tasks of management of patient charts, retrieval of reference information, word processing, appointment scheduling and office organization were each managed by separate programs. Desqview allowed instantaneous switching back and forth between the various programs. I compared the time and cost savings and the need for physician input between Desqview 386, a 386 computer alone and an older, XT computer. Desqview significantly simplified the use of computer programs for medical information management and minimized the necessity for physician intervention. The time saved was 15 minutes per day; the costs saved were estimated to be $5000 annually.\r"

While the values varied irregularly in the first assessments, they then tended to diminish and to be lower than those found at basal level. The ratio of Ni serum concentration to oral intake demonstrated that, as the doses administered increased, the absorption of nickel decreased. We hypothesize that this trend might be due to an intestinal adaptivity that reduces nickel absorption.\r"

From November 1988 to June 1989, we patch tested 626 unselected contact dermatitis patients with Kathon CG solution containing 200 ppm active ingredients and obtained 22 (3.5%) positive reactions. Relevance was established in 7 of the 22 patients. Women were predominantly sensitized, the principal source of sensitization being cosmetics.\r"

Identification of the chemical sensitizers was possible only by using the aforementioned laboratory methods.\r"

In Group I (n = 32) a statistically significantly higher % of patients (47%) showed positive reactions to 1 or more spices, compared with 15% in Group II (N = 71). Among the spices, the highest numbers of reactions were found to nutmeg (28%), paprika (19%) and cloves (12%) in the indicator-positive Group I. Fragrance-mix turned out to be a particularly important indicator allergen, especially for paprika, nutmeg and cloves. The contact allergy in 11 out of 32 (Group I) and 7 out of 25 patch-tested patients (recruited from Group II) appeared to be directed mainly against the ether-extractable volatile fractions of the spices.\r"

During 1987-1988, all new patients aged 15 years or older, who consulted us for dermatitis, were investigated. They were patch tested with the European standard series, methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone and other relevant allergens. In addition, they were prick tested with 24 inhalant and 11 food allergens. Patients having at least 2 positive prick tests, and patients with 1 positive prick test and a (family) history of atopic diseases were defined as atopics, as were those who presented with classic atopic dermatitis but with negative prick tests. 499 patients were evaluated: 159 men and 340 women. 214 patients (43%) were atopic, the other 285 (57%) were non-atopic. In the atopic group, 79 persons (37%) had at least 1 positive patch test reaction. In the group of non-atopics, 149 patients (52%) had contact allergies. The difference is statistically significant (chi 2; p less than 0.05). It is concluded that adult atopics seen in dermatological practice who present with dermatitis are less frequently contact sensitized than such patients who are non-atopic. Nevertheless, a yield of nearly 40% positive patch test reactions in this group still makes routine patch testing necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of submucosal epinephrine injection in the control of bleeding ulcers. Since endoscopic techniques for assessing gastroduodenal blood flow are limited, we employed an animal model to study the mechanism of control of bleeding. The effect of submucosal epinephrine injection on local gastric blood flow was studied in the rat using laser Doppler flowmetry and reflectance spectrophotometry. Submucosal injection of 0.1 ml of 1/10,000 epinephrine caused a significantly greater drop in local gastric blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry) compared with vehicle (10% sodium metabisulfite) injection. The reduction persisted for up to 120 min. This vasoconstrictive effect of epinephrine was confirmed by observations with reflectance spectrophotometry, which documented a pattern of ischemia without congestion (lower index of hemoglobin concentration, lower index of oxygen saturation). The autoregulatory escape from adrenergic vasoconstriction was not evident in either instance. We conclude that, after submucosal injection of epinephrine, the absence of autoregulatory escape from adrenergic vasoconstriction and the marked and prolonged decrease in local gastric blood flow enhance the homeostatic mechanisms (eg, platelets and other coagulative factors) to effect hemostasis in bleeding ulcers.\r"

Two hundred ninety-four studies were performed in 42 healthy volunteers and 237 patients. Three-probe ambulatory 24-hr esophagogastric pH monitoring applicability, tolerability, and capability to determine a relationship between symptoms which occurred during the tests, gastroesophageal reflux, and duodenogastric reflux episodes were assessed. Eighty-nine percent of the three-probe esophagogastric pH studies were easily performed. The examination was tolerated well by 86.1% of the patients and poorly by 13.9%. A temporal correlation between symptoms and pH activities was recognized in 61.3% when the esophageal tracing was considered (acid gastroesophageal reflux recording) and in 95.6% when the three pH traces were simultaneously interpreted. Alkalacid gastroesophageal reflux and duodenogastric reflux total percentage times were significantly higher in patients complaining of dyspeptic symptoms than in patients only affected by typical gastroesophageal symptoms. Three-probe 24-hr ambulatory esophagogastric pH monitoring is a simple, well-tolerated test that should be routinely adopted for the study of patients complaining of unclear upper gastrointestinal tract symptomatology.\r"

All patients with dysphagia were endoscoped to evaluate for mechanical obstruction. Manometry was done focusing on the incidence of peristaltic dysfunction (failed peristaltic sequences or sequences characterized by foci of hypotensive peristalsis). The major finding was that the severity of manometrically demonstrated peristaltic dysfunction in reflux patients correlated with the prevalence of dysphagia. After excluding patients with esophageal rings or strictures from the analysis, the overall prevalence of dysphagia was 39% among the 157 reflux patients. Within this group, 29% of patients with minimal peristaltic dysfunction experienced dysphagia compared to 78% of patients with severe peristaltic dysfunction. We conclude that peristaltic dysfunction should be considered along with mechanical obstruction as a potential cause of dysphagia in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.\r"

In addition, the effects of sialoadenectomy on cell turnover in the gastric mucosa has been examined. Animals were examined at one to five weeks after removal of the submandibular-sublingual salivary gland complex. In response to 100% w/v ethanol, sialoadenectomized rat displayed greater hemorrhagic damage to the gastric mucosa than sham-operated control rats. The difference between sialoadenectomized and sham control rats was significant at two to five weeks after surgery. The rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation into gastric mucosa was significantly reduced in sialoadenectomized rats at one and two weeks. Mucosal DNA concentration was significantly reduced in sialoadenectomized rats at four and five weeks after surgery. Mucosal myeloperoxidase activity was greater in sialoadenectomized rats treated with ethanol compared to control animals, but this difference was only significant at two weeks after surgery. Sialoadenectomy was also associated with a reduction in duodenal and gastric mucosal levels of immunoreactive epidermal growth factor (EGF). Differences between sialoadenectomized and control rats were not significant until three to four weeks after surgery. These data indicate that sialoadenectomy was associated with an increase in the susceptibility of rat gastric mucosa to ethanol-mediated damage. Sialoadenectomy also resulted in a reduction in gastric mucosal growth and gastroduodenal mucosal levels of EGF. However, the influence of sialoadenectomy on the susceptibility of the rat gastric mucosa to ethanol-mediated damage occurred prior to any significant effect on mucosal DNA concentration or EGF levels.\r"

There is only a few hundred ohms resistance between an antimony pH electrode and the reference electrode so that the voltage generated can be recorded with simple low-impedance recorders linked to microcomputers. We used antimony pH electrodes with silver-silver chloride electrodes applied to the skin to measure the gastric pH in vivo and obtained erroneously high values. Using an ion-permeable dialysis chamber to surround electrodes in vivo, we showed that the discrepancy was caused by interference from gastric transmucosal potential difference. To circumvent the interference, we used a combination electrode constructed by embedding a monocrystalline antimony electrode and a silver-silver chloride reference electrode in dental acrylic. Antimony pH electrodes calibrated with commercial pH buffers also gave erroneous readings in HCl solutions of known pH. The erroneous readings were due, in part, to organic complex-forming ligands or organic salts such as potassium phthalate present in commercial buffer solutions. Accurate pH calibration can be obtained with citrate or acetate buffers or by using a normogram to correct for the errors introduced with commercial buffers. The combination antimony pH electrode has a number of potential clinical and research applications and simplifies obtaining accurate and reliable pH data in vivo.\r"

Nine of 25 runners in the 1989 Old Dominion 100-mile Endurance Race took 800 mg of cimetidine 1 hr before the start and at 50 miles. Sixteen other runners acted as controls and were not different in age, gender, or training data. All runners also submitted three stool specimens from the week before the race and from the first three bowel movements after the race on standard Hemoccult cards. All runners were Hemoccult negative before the race. One of the 9 (11%) cimetidine runners and 14 of the 16 (87.5%) control runners were Hemoccult positive afterwards (P less than or equal to 0.05). Nausea and vomiting were less in those runners taking cimetidine (P less than or equal to 0.05). There was no difference in the race performance as related to the ability to finish or in the number of miles run during the race. This study may help to define the etiology of this common gastrointestinal bleeding in these ultradistance runners and may be useful in preventing some of the symptoms associated with long-distance running.\r"

The aim of this study was to measure gastric myoelectric activity in women with and without nausea during the first trimester of pregnancy. In 32 pregnant women gastric myoeletric activity was recorded for 30-45 min with cutaneous electrodes that yielded electrogastrograms (EGGs). Frequencies of the EGG waves were analyzed visually and by computer. Subjects rated their nausea at the time of EGG recording on a visual analog scale with 0 representing no nausea and 300 mm severe nausea. Gastric dysrhythmias were found in 26 pregnant subject: Seventeen had tachygastrias (EGG frequencies of 4-9 cpm), five had 1- to 2-cpm EGG waves, and four had flat-line patterns Mean nausea scores of the subjects with tachygastrias, 1- to 2-cpm, and flat-line patterns were 64.8 +/- 13, 93.4 +/- 23, and 77.2 +/- 36, respectively. Six pregnant subjects had normal 3-cpm EGG patterns, and their nausea scores averaged 2.8 +/- 1.1 (P less than 0.05 compared with nausea scores in subjects with tachygastrias, 1- to 2-cpm, and flat-line rhythms). Six subjects with gastric dysrhythmias during pregnancy were restudied after delivery; each of these subjects had normal 3-cpm EGG patterns and none had nausea. Thus, gastric dysrhythmias are objective pathophysiologic events associated with symptoms of nausea reported during the first trimester of pregnancy.\r"

Preoperatively all controls and patients had normal recordings. In the cholecystectomized patients no significant changes were found postoperatively. Ten days after highly selective vagotomy the normal initial postprandial dip in gastric ECA frequency and the subsequent increase in frequency and power were not seen. Tachygastrias were observed in three patients. Six months after operation the normal frequency and power responses to a test meal had returned, but both the fasting and postprandial ECA frequencies were raised significantly. It is concluded that highly selective vagotomy is associated with abnormalities in myoelectrical activity, in particular in the postprandial state, most of which are reversible with time.\r"

  ".W": "Pathogenesis of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions was investigated in the rat by measuring lesions, gastric motility, and terminal blood glucose levels and correlating them with each other. Subcutaneously administered indomethacin (3-25 mg/kg) dose-dependently produced lesions in the stomach with concomitant gastric hypermotility and reduction of blood glucose levels. When the lesion score and the motility were plotted against terminal glucose levels, a highly significant relationship was found among these three factors (P less than 0.01). Gastric lesions and hypermotility induced by indomethacin (25 mg/kg) were suppressed significantly by 16,16-dmPGE2 (10 micrograms/kg) with no effect on the glucose levels, while intravenous infusion of glucose (25% w/w, 1.4 ml/hr) prevented these responses and restored the reduced glucose levels above the basal values. In addition, both 16,16-dmPGE2 and glucose infusion afforded a significant protection against gastric lesions induced by indomethacin even in the acid-perfused stomach (150 mM HCl). These results confirmed gastric hypermotility as a key element in the pathogenesis of indomethacin-induced lesions and further suggested that indomethacin may sensitive gastric contractility through glycoprivic receptors by inducing hypoglycemia and PG deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the accuracy of IgG and IgA serological tests in establishing a diagnosis of Helicobacter (Campylobacter) pylori gastric infection, 60 children presenting with chronic abdominal pain were prospectively studied. Endoscopic antral biopsies were obtained and analyzed for the presence of H. pylori using three standard methods: culture and identification of bacterial isolates, microscopic examination for morphologically characteristic bacteria, and urease production by the biopsy specimen. Concomitantly obtained serum samples were analyzed for the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against H. pylori surface antigens using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Thirty-four of 60 (56.6%) had histological evidence of chronic active gastritis, eight of whom (13.3%) also had evidence of H. pylori infection by at least one criteria. Six of the eight infected patients had H. pylori demonstrated by all three methods. Of the eight infected patients, seven had IgG antibodies against H. pylori (sensitivity of 87%) and six had IgA antibodies (sensitivity of 75%). Among the six patients who had H. pylori infection confirmed by all three methods, all had IgG antibodies (sensitivity of 100%). In the patients without evidence of H. pylori infection, the IgG ELISA had a specificity of 96% (50/52), and the IgA ELISA had a specificity of 100% (52/52). Our data suggest that serological testing for the presence of antibodies against H. pylori may be a useful diagnostic tool in screening children with chronic abdominal pain for the presence of gastric infection with H. pylori.\r"

  ".U": "90345787\r", 
  ".W": "In 14 healthy male volunteers, we studied the influence of acute mental (= psychological) stress induced by performing mental arithmetic and solving anagrams against a financial reward on endogenously stimulated gastric acid output. Personality factors were determined by the Personality Research Form. Acute mental stress significantly (P less than 0.05) increased systolic blood pressure (+8.9 +/- 2.0 mm Hg +/- SEM) and heart rate (+5.3 +/- 1.6 beats/min). The mean gastric acid output during the mental stress period (17.9 +/- 2.7 mmol/32 min) did not significantly differ from pre- (16.9 +/- 2.3 mmol/32 min) and poststress (18.1 +/- 2.2 mmol/32 min) values. However, detailed analysis revealed that mental stress induced contrary changes of gastric acid output in different subjects. About half the individuals reacted with a decrease (up to 60%) and the other half with an increase (up to 60%) in acid output. In some individuals the changes of gastric acid output were very small. By multiple correlations, impulsivity was identified as the personality trait with the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.82) with changes of gastric acid output during the acute mental stress period. During the mental stress period, gastric acid output increased in subjects with high scores on the impulsivity scale, but significantly decreased in those with low scores. We conclude that (1) there is a great individual variability in gastric acid response to acute mental stress, and (2) this variability may be partly attributed to differences in personality traits.\r"

  ".W": "Based on the observation that insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) can stimulate glucose utilization in nondiabetic subjects and that the action of the IGF-I receptor is normal in the skeletal muscle of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), it seems possible that IGF-I might provide an effective acute treatment for the hyperglycemia of NIDDM. Using our recently developed in vitro human muscle preparation, we investigated the hypothesis that IGF-I might be an effective alternative to insulin in stimulating glucose transport in diabetic muscle. Abdominal muscle samples from nonobese nondiabetic, obese nondiabetic, and obese NIDDM patients were obtained during elective abdominal surgery. Plasma levels of IGF-I in diabetic patients were lower than those in either of the nondiabetic groups. Binding studies with wheat-germ-agglutinin-chromatography-purified receptors demonstrated the presence of IGF-I receptors in human muscle, with IGF-I binding being approximately 24% that of insulin. There was no change in IGF-I binding in muscle from obese or diabetic subjects, and the structural characteristics of the IGF-I receptor were not altered, as determined by electrophoretic mobility. IGF-I stimulated glucose transport approximately twofold in incubated muscle from control subjects, but there was no IGF-I stimulation of transport in muscle from obese subjects with or without NIDDM. These results confirm a previous report that human muscle contains receptors for IGF-I and demonstrate for the first time that IGF-I can stimulate glucose transport in human muscle. However, muscle from obese subjects with or without NIDDM is resistant to the action of IGF-I.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies showing downregulation of blood-brain barrier (BBB) glucose-transporter activity in vivo in experimental diabetes have recently been questioned. Therefore, our investigations examined both the BBB glucose-transporter activity in experimental diabetes in vivo, with the use of the in situ internal carotid artery perfusion technique, and the microvessel glucose-transporter concentration, with quantitative Western immunoblots. These studies show that BBB glucose-transporter activity in vivo is decreased 44% in experimental diabetes (blood glucose concn 443 +/- 12 mg/dl), parallel with a 44% decrease in cerebral blood flow, a normal brain blood volume, and a 75% prolongation of capillary transit time. The glucose-transporter concentration is decreased 77 +/- 9% in microvessels isolated from diabetic rat brain compared with controls, as measured by quantitative Western blotting. These studies confirm the original observations that the BBB glucose transporter is downregulated in experimental diabetes, in association with a parallel decrease in cerebral blood flow. In addition, these studies, in conjunction with other recent experiments from this laboratory showing elevated glucose-transporter mRNA in diabetic rat brain capillaries, suggest the primary mechanism underlying the downregulation is a posttranscriptional inhibition of glucose-transporter mRNA translation.\r"

  ".W": "Kidney biopsies from 14 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with persistent albuminuria were studied by light and electron microscopy. In terms of kidney function, the patients spanned stages from early to advanced nephropathy. The clinical parameters were (ranges, with medians in parentheses) urinary albumin excretion (UAE) 158-5494 micrograms/min (1153 micrograms/min), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 30-128 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (90 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2) and mean arterial blood pressure (BP) 87-122 mmHg (109 mmHg). The severity of clinical nephropathy (UAE, GFR, and BP together) correlated with an index of the structural lesions (basement membrane [BM] thickness, mesangial expansion, and glomerular occlusion together; r = 0.62, 2P less than 0.05). GFR compared with remnant surface of glomerular capillaries (filtration surface; FS) gave values of r = 0.72 and 2P = 0.004, and UAE compared with the percentage of the peripheral BM surface carrying fluffy loose intrinsic fine structure gave r = 0.62 and 2P = 0.02. BP per se did not correlate with structural parameters. The area of FS per open glomerulus did not decrease with increasing mesangial volume fraction, which indicates compensatory changes of the capillaries in early and advanced stages of glomerulopathy. In 7 patients with less than 10% occluded glomeruli, correlations between glomerular volume and the parameters of diabetic glomerulopathy (i.e., BM thickness and volume fractions of mesangium and mesangial matrix) failed to reach statistical significance. The actual glomerular volume, however, is a product of the individual's original glomerular volume, probably the early diabetic hypertrophy and modifying changes consequent to the development of glomerulopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The immune abnormalities of NOD mice, a model of human type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes, have been postulated to be T-lymphocyte dependent. We measured responsiveness to exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-2 production in spleen mononuclear cells from female NOD/Shi/Kbe mice after stimulating the cells with concanavalin A (ConA blasts) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA blasts). Exogenous IL-2 produced significantly lower proliferative responses in each blast from 3- and 10-wk-old NOD/Shi/Kbe mice than from control strains. IL-2 production in NOD/Shi/Kbe mice was inclined to decrease but not significantly compared with controls. Even sufficient amounts of recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) or IL-1 (rIL-1), added with mitogens to the preculture medium, failed to provoke normal proliferative responses from NOD/Shi/Kbe mouse cells. To clarify the reason for this defect, we investigated the expression of IL-2 receptors (IL-2Rs) on mitogen-activated cells with anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibody (PC61) and radiolabeled IL-2. Cytofluorometry showed no significant difference between strains in the number of PC61+ ConA and PHA blasts. However, Scatchard analysis with 125I-labeled IL-2 showed that the number of high-affinity IL-2Rs (H-IL-2Rs), the mediators of the biological activity of IL-2, was decreased in NOD/Shi/Kbe mice compared with controls, whereas the number of low-affinity IL-2Rs (L-IL-2Rs) was not different. Separating the L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ populations of T lymphocytes by cell sorting showed both to be deficient in H-IL-2Rs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Repeated large-volume blood withdrawals started at a young age previously appeared to correct lymphopenia and prevent diabetes in Ottawa diabetes-prone BB (BBdp) rats. Therefore, we sought an early effect 24 h after withdrawal of 25% of estimated blood volume and then reexamined the long-term effects in BBdp rats. The reexamination was prompted by the occurrence of variable numbers of BBdp rats positive for RT6.1 (a T-lymphocyte differentiation alloantigen) whose presence appears to \"protect\" against diabetes development (identified as BBp rats). Four groups were studied: non-diabetes-prone (BBn), RT6.1- BBdp, RT6.1+ BBp, and acutely diabetic BB (BBd) rats. An acute increase in the number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and many subsets occurred in BBd and BBp rats. Despite these acute effects, a long-term effect of repeated blood withdrawal was not found in circulating cell counts or prevention of diabetes in BBdp rats. Thus, the previous finding was probably attributable to the presence of BBp rats. The long-term study demonstrated that RT6.1 expression in BBn rats increased from low levels at 15 days, peaked at 50 days, and decreased thereafter, an important finding in interpreting RT6.1 status at different ages. Furthermore, in contrast with other subsets, MARK-1+ B lymphocytes and OX42+ monocytes/macrophages decreased markedly in number at 120 and 150 days in BBn and BBp rats, whereas counts were higher and sustained in BBdp rats. The latter finding could be related to BBdp rats successfully resisting the autoaggressive process beyond the peak age of diabetes onset.\r"

This article focuses on the baseline prevalence of complications in the 657 subjects diagnosed between 1950 and 1980 and currently aged 8-48 yr, with a mean duration of 20 yr. In addition to background retinopathy being virtually universal after 20 yr of diabetes, proliferative retinopathy affects 70% of IDDM subjects after 30 yr duration. As with overt nephropathy, prevalence of proliferative retinopathy is marginally higher in females than in males at short durations; the previously reported male excess is limited to the subjects with IDDM of longer duration (greater than or equal to 25 yr). Somewhat different patterns of microalbuminuria are also seen by sex. Males show a threefold increase in prevalence from 10 to 25 yr duration, whereas females show a more constant prevalence across these durations. A further rise in microalbuminuria is seen in males but not females at greater than or equal to 30 yr duration, giving a combined prevalence of microalbuminuria and overt nephropathy at greater than or equal to 30 yr duration of 84% (males) and 59% (females). Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy shows a constant rise with duration and is only marginally higher in men. Prevalence of cardiovascular (coronary and cerebral) disease shows no sex difference, whereas peripheral vascular disease is particularly common in women after 30 yr duration (greater than 30%) compared with men (11%) when determined by ankle/arm blood pressure ratio less than 0.8 at rest or after exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sampling frame for the study included all known diabetic individuals and all other residents based on a complete citywide census of residents greater than or equal to 20yr of age. A stratified random sample that included three stratifying factors (age [20-39, 40-59, greater than or equal to 60 yr], sex, and self-reported weekly use of any prescribed medication was drawn from the other residents). The study protocol required diet preparation and two full mornings of testing. Data collected included height, weight, and blood pressure measurements and both a personal interview and a medications questionnaire. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a test with a standard liquid meal (Ensure-Plus challenge test [EPCT], Ross) were done on two mornings, with the order of testing randomly assigned. Clinical tests included one-time samples for hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin, plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoproteins. Blood samples for glucose and creatinine assays were taken during the OGTT; blood samples for glucose, free fatty acid, creatinine, and C-peptide were taken during the EPCT. Urine collections were performed for both challenge tests and assayed for C-peptide and creatinine.

Although DR3 and DR4 were positively associated with IDDM in the probands of 123 northern European, 94 Ashkenazi Jewish, and 49 New York Hispanic families, significant excess of DR*3/4 heterozygotes was observed only among the probands from families of northern European ancestry. There was also a significant decrease in the frequency of Bw62,DR4 haplotypes derived by northern European patients from their mothers compared with their fathers. This difference, together with data reported in the literature, suggests that the expressivity of the susceptible genotype(s) in IDDM patients may be modified by protective maternal effects associated with Bw62,DR4 and probably other DR4 haplotypes. Samples of IDDM patients from populations with high frequencies of these modifiers should have different DR-gene frequencies contributed by fathers and mothers, capable of accounting for the observed Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. We postulate that, because the mechanism of action of these modifiers is distinct from that of the susceptibility gene, the difference must be considered in devising strategies for elucidation of the mode of inheritance of the disease and for understanding the molecular nature of the susceptibility.\r"

Obstetrical and perinatal literature suggest that those specialties may be able to decrease rural neonatal mortality. However, family practice literature has not shown any examples of direct intervention decreasing neonatal mortality in rural areas. This paper presents an isolated rural Utah community which had a neonatal mortality rate twice that of the rest of the state from 1971-1980. Through local family practice initiatives, the neonatal mortality rate decreased in a significant fashion to a level equal to the rest of the state from 1981-1985. Other social, economic, and political factors which may influence the neonatal mortality rate were examined and did not contribute to decreased mortality.\r"

Of the 90 patients over the age of 18 seen for problem or health maintenance visits who were included in the study, 64 adequately completed the instruments at the time of the visit and one month later. Functional assessments by in-person, mail, and telephone methods of administration were similar. Patients' MWFA scores did not significantly improve by the time of the one-month follow-up. Mini-DUHP subscales for symptom and physical function also did not significantly improve. Mini-DUHP emotional, social, and composite scores indicated a decrease in function following the visits, particularly visits for health maintenance. MWFA and Mini-DUHP scores correlated only modestly, with the highest correlation occurring between Mini-DUHP Physical Score and the MWFA (0.414 or 0.509, P less than .001). Additional study is needed to identify or develop an instrument that can adequately assess broad changes in functioning for multiple diagnoses following specific physician interventions, and the reason for the decline in emotional and social function following visits needs further elucidation and evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "The value of integrating preventive medicine into primary care is widely accepted, although practical teaching methods to model this integration into medical student clerkships are not well developed. This paper reports on a competency-based clinical preventive medicine curriculum developed within an existing family medicine clinical clerkship. Evaluation of the curriculum during its first full year of implementation shows that students can significantly improve their perceived levels of competence in discussing specific healthy behaviors and risk factors as well as their fund of knowledge in preventive medicine content areas. However, the greatest effect of the curriculum was on increasing students' knowledge of basic health promotion concepts. Results from this clerkship suggest that collaborative efforts to integrate clinical preventive medicine into primary care education and to support the teaching of health promotion and disease prevention in clinical clerkships can be successful.\r"

Optimal medical management may be jeopardized by the emotional responses of physicians caring for such patients. These responses may pose moral dilemmas for the physician, who may be reluctant to treat these patients. Even though physicians have the right to dismiss such patients, the ethos of primary care engenders a sense of obligation to provide access to care. Traditional continuing medical education (CME) overemphasizes content and avoids emotional issues common in problematic physician-patient relationships. This CME demonstration project for community based physicians addressed this issue through a longitudinal course which was learner-centered and process-oriented. This article reports the successes and difficulties in organizing this innovative course.\r"

Seven of the 22 preceptors had significant positive correlations for both criterion measures, while seven of 22 did not correlate at a significant level for either. Examination of the two extreme groups found significantly different group means when the number of years of teaching experience was the dependent variable. The good predictors had 6.28 +/- SD 3.90 years of experience versus 2.71 +/- SD 2.02 years for low predictors. The authors conclude from these results that years of experience is an important factor in the preceptor's ability to assess cognitive levels. The authors speculate that the inability to accurately assess a trainee's knowledge may negatively affect resident-preceptor interactions.\r"

During the middle year only, reminders were issued to patients in the experimental group. A comparison of immunization patterns over the three years in experimental and control groups indicated that the reminder both promoted independent action and engendered dependency on the reminder. The former, favorable effect was more frequent among younger patients; the latter, adverse effect was more common among older patients who visited the practice more frequently.\r"

The role of the community hospital is also of interest to Oglesby. He sees these institutions as vital players in providing the total health care agenda for the people they serve. This will take commitment, he says, as well as a forward-looking and flexible attitude that allows hospitals to modify services as the community dictates. Oglesby currently serves as an AHA commissioner on the Committee of Commissioners to the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) at a time when this organization has come under considerable criticism from the hospital field. As part of his interview with Hospitals, he was asked how responsive he feels the JCAHO has been to concerns from the field and his vision of the importance of the JCAHO to the future of health care.\r"

Airway responsiveness was assessed by determining the provocative concentration of ACh and AA aerosols that increased respiratory resistance (Rrs) to twice the base-line value. O3 (3 parts per million) increased airway responsiveness to ACh in dogs both sensitive and insensitive to AA, and it significantly decreased the ACh provocation concentration from 0.541 +/- 0.095 to 0.102 +/- 0.047 (SE) mg/ml (P less than 0.01; n = 10). AA aerosols, even at the highest concentration in combination with O3, did not increase Rrs in dogs insensitive to AA. However, O3 increased airway responsiveness to AA in AA-sensitive dogs and significantly decreased log AA provocation concentration from 2.34 +/- 0.22 to 0.50 +/- 0.17 (SE) log protein nitrogen units/ml (P less than 0.01; n = 7). O3-induced hyperresponsiveness to ACh returned to the base-line level within 2 wk, but hyperresponsiveness to AA continued for greater than 2 wk. The plasma histamine concentration after AA challenge was significantly higher after than before O3 (P less than 0.01). Intravenous infusion of OKY-046 (100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), an inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis, inhibited the O3-induced increase in responsiveness to ACh, but it had no effects on the O3-induced increase in responsiveness to AA and the increase in the plasma histamine concentration. These results suggest that O3 increases susceptibility to the antigen in sensitized dogs via a different mechanism from that of O3-induced muscarinic hyperresponsiveness.\r"

Physiol. 66: 1772-1778, 1989), we asked whether similar effects would occur after neonatal exposure to hypercapnia. Three groups of rats were used. The first was exposed to 7% CO2 in normoxia from day 1 to 7 after birth and then returned to normocapnia (NB-CO2). The second was exposed to the same level and duration of hypercapnia from day 36 to 42, i.e., approximately 2 wk after weaning (AD-CO2). The third was raised in normoxia and normocapnia (control). At approximately 50 days, i.e., 1-2 wk after puberty, the passive mechanical properties of the respiratory system, lung, and chest were measured during artificial ventilation in the anesthetized and paralyzed animal. No differences were observed between AD-CO2 and control. NB-CO2 had higher compliance of the lung (approximately +40%) and respiratory system (+32%) than control or AD-CO2. Average values of resistance of the total respiratory system, lung, and chest wall were consistently lower in NB-CO2 than in control and AD-CO2, although the magnitude and statistical significance of the decrease depended on the method of measurement. In a separate group of NB-CO2, lung compliance was measured during spontaneous breathing, and it averaged 34% more than in control. The exponential constant of the deflation quasi-static pressure-volume curve of the liquid-filled lungs was also significantly higher than in control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of continuous inflation of lungs at 30 cmH2O transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) on air-space size was assessed by chord length-frequency distribution analysis. Lungs from gerbils were excised, allowed to collapse freely, and inflated to 30 cmH2O Ptp in a humidified chamber kept at 37 degrees C. When the lungs appeared fully inflated with no observable pleural surface atelectasis, the left lung was occluded while the right was maintained at 30 cmH2O for 10 min longer and then occluded. During this time, the right lung increased its volume from 70 to 100%. Then both lungs were quick frozen, freeze dried, and embedded in glycol methacrylate, and 1- to 2-microns-thick histological sections cut. Lungs from a control group of gerbils were similarly inflated to 30 cmH2O, both left and right were occluded, the left was quick frozen immediately, and the right was frozen 10 min later. Chord lengths of air spaces from cranial and caudal lobes of lungs were acquired using a Dapple Systems image analyzer, and a two-population frequency distribution was generated for analysis with an IBM PC. The results indicate that the volume increase during continuous inflation at 30 cmH2O Ptp was associated with a shift in the chord length distribution toward the smaller chord lengths. A two-population statistical analysis indicated that the inflation resulted in an increase in the relative proportion of smaller chord lengths, with no increase in the mean of this smaller population. We conclude that continuous inflation at 30 cmH2O Ptp results in alveolar recruitment.\r"

  ".W": "Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) is lower during maximum inspiratory effort with the diaphragm alone than when maximum inspiratory and expulsive efforts are combined. The increase in Pdi with expulsive effort has been attributed to increased neural activation of the diaphragm. Alternatively, the increase could be due to stretching of the contracted diaphragm. If this were so, Pdi measured during a combined maximum effort would overestimate the capacity of the diaphragm to generate inspiratory force. This study determined the likely contribution of stretching of the contracted diaphragm to estimates of maximum Pdi (Pdimax) obtained during combined inspiratory and expulsive effort. Three healthy trained subjects were studied standing. Diaphragmatic Mueller maneuvers were performed at functional residual capacity and sustained during subsequent abdominal compression by either abdominal muscle expulsive effort or externally applied pressure. Measurements were made of changes in abdominal (Pab) and pleural (Ppl) pressure, Pdi, rib cage and abdominal dimensions and respiratory electromyograms. Three reproducible performances of each maneuver from each subject were analyzed. When expulsive effort was added to maximum diaphragmatic inspiratory effort, Pdimax increased from 86 +/- 12 to 148 +/- 14 (SD) cmH2O within the 1st s and was 128 +/- 14 cmH2O 2 s later. When external compression was added to maximum diaphragmatic inspiratory effort, Pdimax increased from 87 +/- 16 to 171 +/- 19 cmH2O within the 1st s and was 152 +/- 16 cmH2O 2 s later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Electrical stimulation of rat sensory nerves produces cutaneous vasodilation and plasma protein extravasation, a phenomenon termed \"neurogenic inflammation\". Rat skin on the dorsum of the paw developed neurogenic inflammation after electrical stimulation of the saphenous nerve. In tissue sections, the extravasation of the supravital dye monastral blue B identified permeable vessels. Mast cells were identified by toluidine blue stain. Permeable vessels were significantly more dense in the superficial 120 microns of the dermis than in the deeper dermis, whereas mast cells were significantly more frequent in the deeper dermis. The relationships between nociceptive sensory nerve fibers, permeable vessels, and mast cells were examined by indirect immunohistochemistry for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neurokinin A (NKA), and substance P (SP). CGRP-, NKA-, and SP-containing nerves densely innervated the superficial dermis and appeared to innervate the vessels that became permeable during neurogenic inflammation. In contrast, mast cells were not associated with either permeable vessels or nerve fibers. These data suggest that electrical stimulation of rat sensory nerves produces vascular permeability by inducing the release of neuropeptides that may directly stimulate the superficial vascular bed. Mast cells may not be involved in this stage of cutaneous neurogenic inflammation in rat skin.\r"

  ".W": "Seven human spinal cord-lesioned subjects (SPL) underwent electrically induced muscle contractions (EMC) of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles for 10 min: 5 min control, 2 min with venous return from the legs occluded, and 3 min postocclusion. Group mean changes in CO2 output compared with rest were +107 +/- 30.6, +21 +/- 25.7, and +192 +/- 37.0 (SE) ml/min during preocclusion, occlusion, and postocclusion EMC, respectively. Mean arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) obtained from catheterized radial arteries at 15- to 30-s intervals showed a significant (P less than 0.05) hypocapnia (36.2 Torr) during occlusion and a significant (P less than 0.05) hypercapnia (38.1 Torr) postocclusion relative to a group mean preocclusion EMC PaCO2 of 37.5 Torr. Relative to preocclusion EMC, expired ventilation (VE) decreased during occlusion and increased after release of occlusion. However, changes in VE always occurred after changes in end-tidal PCO2 (mean 41 s after occlusion and 10 s after release of occlusion). In the two subjects investigated during hyperoxia, the VE and PaCO2 responses to occlusion and release did not differ from normoxia. We conclude that the data do not support mediation of the EMC hyperpnea in SPL by humoral mechanisms that others have proposed for mediation of the exercise hyperpnea in spinal cord-intact humans.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies exploring the utility of liquid breathing using perfluorocarbon have reported proximal airway pressures (Paw) as high as 70 Torr during inspiration, generating concern about the safety of this form of mechanical ventilation. Effects on the pulmonary capillary bed are, however, more likely related to alveolar pressure (PA) than to Paw, and data on PA during liquid breathing are limited. In this study in infant lambs, we reconstructed the pressure waveforms of PA during liquid breathing by using an occlusion technique and compared these with Paw waveforms. Peak PA (18.6 +/- 10.4 Torr) was significantly less than peak Paw (31.5 +/- 10.5 Torr, P less than 0.001), indicating a large resistive pressure drop (14.4 +/- 4.5 Torr) across the bronchial tree. Mean PA (mPA) was very similar to mean Paw (mPaw) [bias = -2.0 Torr, standard error of the average difference = 0.27 Torr, predictive value of mPaw for mPA (r2) = 0.978], suggesting that mPaw, which is easily measured, may be used to estimate mPA during perfluorocarbon liquid breathing. These data show that alveoli do not experience the same large swings in pressure as the proximal airway does during liquid breathing and that simple measurements of mPaw can be used to approximate mPA during liquid breathing.\r"

To determine whether exercise training can attenuate ischemia and reperfusion-induced microvascular injury in skeletal muscle, intact (with skin) and skinned, maximally vasodilated (papaverine), isolated hindquarters of control (C) and exercise-trained (ET) rats were subjected to ischemia (intact 120 min; skinned 60 min) followed by 60 min of reperfusion. ET rats ran on a motorized treadmill at 32 m/min (8% grade), 2 h/day for 12 wk, whereas the C rats were cage confined. Before ischemia, ET hindquarters had higher isogravimetric flow, lower Rt, and similar solvent drag reflection coefficients (sigma f) compared with C. During reperfusion in intact hindquarters, flow was higher (P less than 0.05) and Rt tended to be lower (15 +/- 2 vs. 25 +/- 5 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 g; P less than 0.1) in ET compared with C; however, in skinned hindquarters flow and Rt (14 +/- 2 vs. 13 +/- 2 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 g) were not different between C and ET. During reperfusion, sigma f was reduced (P less than 0.05) in both intact (C 0.68 +/- 0.03; ET 0.68 +/- 0.02) and skinned (C 0.66 +/- 0.03; ET 0.68 +/- 0.03) hindquarters, indicative of an increased microvascular permeability to plasma proteins. These results indicate that exercise training did not attenuate the microvascular injury (increased Rt and decreased sigma f) associated with ischemia and reperfusion in rat skeletal muscle.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exercise trained (ET) on a treadmill 2 h/day at 32 m/min (8% incline) 5 days/wk or were cage confined (sedentary control, S) for 12 wk. In both S and ET rats, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities were directly correlated with the percentages of oxidative fibers in the six skeletal muscle samples studied. Muscles of ET rats had increased oxidative capacity and increased GPX activity compared with the same muscles of S rats. However, SOD activities were not different between ET and S rats, but CAT activities were lower in skeletal muscles of ET rats than in S rats. Exposure to 60 min of ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion (I/R) resulted in decreased GPX and increased CAT activities but had little or no effect on SOD activities in muscles from both S and ET rats. The I/R-induced increase in CAT activity was greater in muscles of ET than in muscles of S rats. Xanthine oxidase (XO), xanthine dehydrogenase (XD), and XO + XD activities after I/R were not related to muscle oxidative capacity and were similar in muscles of ET and S rats. It is concluded that although antioxidant enzyme activities are related to skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, the effects of exercise training on antioxidant enzymes in skeletal muscle cannot be predicted by measured changes in oxidative capacity.\r"

During rebreathing the dogs were ventilated in closed circuit with a gas mixture containing 0.06% NO, 0.06% 13C18O, and 1% He in Ar for 15 s, with tidal volume of 0.5 liter and frequency of 60/min. The partial pressures of NO, 13C18O, 16O18O, N2, Ar, CO2, and He in the trachea were continuously analyzed by mass spectrometry. Measurements were performed at various O2 levels characterized by the mean end-expired PO2 during rebreathing (PE'O2). In control conditions (\"normoxia,\" PE'O2 = 67 +/- 8 Torr) the following mean +/- SD values were obtained (in ml.min-1.Torr-1): DLNO = 52.4 +/- 11.0 and DLCO = 15.4 +/- 2.9. In hypoxia (PE'O2 = 24 +/- 7 Torr) DLNO increased by 11 +/- 8% and DLCO by 19 +/- 10%, and in hyperoxia (PE'O2 = 390 +/- 26 Torr) DLNO decreased to 87 +/- 3% and DLCO to 56 +/- 8% with respect to values in normoxia. DLNO/DLCO of 3.24 +/- 0.06 (hypoxia), 3.38 +/- 0.31 (normoxia), and 5.54 +/- 1.04 (hyperoxia) were significantly higher than the NO/CO Krogh diffusion constant ratio (1.92) predicted for simple diffusion through aqueous layers. With increasing O2 uptake elicited by 2,4-dinitrophenol, DLNO and DLCO increased and DLNO/DLCO remained close to unchanged. The results suggest that the combined effects of diffusion and chemical reaction with hemoglobin limit alveolar-capillary transport of CO. If it is assumed that reaction kinetics of NO with hemoglobin (known to be extremely fast) are not rate limiting for NO uptake, the contribution of the slow chemical reaction with hemoglobin to the total CO uptake resistance (= 1/DLCO) was estimated to be 38% in hypoxia, 41% in normoxia, and 64% in hyperoxia. The various factors expected to restrict the validity of this analysis are discussed, in particular the effects of functional inhomogeneity.\r"

Cerebral vascular resistance increased from 1.5 (1.0-2.2) to 2.4 (1.4-3.0) mmHg. 100 g.min.ml-1 (P less than 0.025) at 32% of MVC. There was no difference in CBF between the two hemispheres at rest or during exercise.

Ten healthy subjects trained one leg under normobaric conditions and the other under hypobaric conditions. At each session the subjects trained each leg for 30 min. The absolute work intensity was the same for both legs and was chosen to correspond to 65% of the average (right and left) pretraining one-legged maximal work capacity. There were three to four training sessions per week for 4 wk. Muscle biopsies from each leg were taken before and after training and analyzed for fiber types, capillaries, myoglobin, and oxidative and glycolytic enzymes. The most striking finding was a greater increase of citrate synthase activity under hypobaric conditions than under normobaric conditions. In addition, the myoglobin content increased in the leg trained under hypobaric conditions, whereas it tended to decrease in the normobarically trained leg. Because both legs were trained at the same intensity, the oxygen turnover and the substrate flux through the carboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory chain must have been of similar magnitude. Thus a difference in substrate flux is less likely to have caused the differences in enzyme activities and myoglobin content between training under normobaric and hypobaric conditions. Instead, the stimulus seems to be related to the blood oxygen content or tension.\r"

Instrumentation includes arterial, aortic, and central venous catheterization by a surgical technique that does not require entry to peritoneal or thoracic cavities. It provides a means for right atrial indicator delivery with aortic temperature recording of thermodilution curves. Accuracy was confirmed by comparison to measurement by Swan-Ganz catheters. Diurnal variations of systemic arterial pressure in long-term study of conscious baboons were shown to result from significant increases in cardiac output by day (P less than 0.001), despite concomitant falls in systemic vascular resistance. The cardiac output values obtained were 0.13 l.min-1.kg-1 at night and 0.16 l.min-1.kg-1 by day. Comparison of these results to previous reports of cardiac output in baboons highlights the inadequacies of methods that require physical restraint or anesthesia. This technique also leaves the baboons intact for subsequent breeding or experimental use after catheter removal without the need for further surgery.\r"

NADPH, the principal substrate for NADPH-oxidase-dependent O2-. generation, was measured in the alveolar macrophages and quick-frozen lungs by the enzyme-cycling method. O2-. generation after PMA was significantly lower in the alveolar macrophages of diabetics than in the controls (14.4 +/- 2.0 nmol.10(6) cells-1.20 min-1 vs. 26.2 +/- 1.9, P less than 0.05). Conversely the peripheral blood monocytes of diabetics demonstrated an enhanced O2-. production after PMA stimulation.

Thin slices from freeze-dried samples were photographed and assessed for periarterial and perivenous cuff area and for blue coloration with a score of 0 to 5. Bloodless extravascular lung water (EVLW) was also measured. The smoke-exposed animals were compared with controls and with animals exposed to alloxan or to high-pressure-induced pulmonary edema. EVLW at 2 h after smoke (6.46 +/- 0.80) was above control value (4.30 +/- 0.63) but not different from the alloxan (6.13 +/- 0.70) or high-pressure (6.88 +/- 1.30) groups. Despite the similarity in EVLW in the edematous lungs, there were marked differences in the intensity of blue color and size of cuffing around arteries and veins: the smoke, alloxan, and high-pressure groups had blue color scores of 1.0 +/- 0.1, 2.9 +/- 0.3, and 0.3 +/- 0.1, respectively. These scores indicated a large increase in microvascular permeability to proteins in the alloxan group, a moderate increase in the smoke group, and minimal change in the high-pressure group. The perivascular cuff area was largest in the alloxan group and moderate in the smoke and high-pressure groups. The cuff area was higher for arteries than for veins in all groups except the 0.5-h smoke group. We conclude that smoke inhalation causes a moderate increase in permeability and EVLW compared with alloxan. The extravascular lung water accumulates preferentially around the arteries, but the size of the perivascular cuff is not similar for all causes of pulmonary edema.\r"

Physiol. 67: 2323-2330, 1989). A previously used six-element model has suggested that the resonance is due to alveolar gas compression (Cg) resonating with tissue inertance (Iti). However, the density dependence of the resonance indicates that is associated with the first airway acoustic resonance. The goal of this study was to determine whether unique properties for tissues and airways can be extracted from Zrs data by use of models that incorporate airway acoustic phenomena. We applied several models incorporating airway acoustics to the 2.5- to 320-Hz data from nine healthy adult humans during room air (RA) and 20% He-80% O2 (HeO2) breathing. A model consisting of a single open-ended rigid tube produced a resonance far sharper than that seen in the data. To dampen the resonance features, we used a model of multiple open-ended rigid tubes in parallel. This model fit the data very well for both RA and HeO2 but required fewer and longer tubes with HeO2. Another way to dampen the resonance was to use a single rigid tube terminated with an alveolar-tissue unit. This model also fit the data well, but the alveolar Cg estimates were far smaller than those expected based on the subject's thoracic gas volume. If Cg was fixed based on the thoracic gas volume, a large number of tubes were again required. These results along with additional simulations show that from input Zrs alone one cannot uniquely identify features indigenous to alveolar Cg or to the respiratory tissues.\r"

Peak LV pressure remained significantly elevated throughout 20 min of postexercise recovery (P less than 0.01), and heart rate, LV end-diastolic pressure, and LV +/- dP/dt returned rapidly to preexercise values. Corresponding to these in vivo hemodynamic changes, increased levels of P-light chain phosphorylation were observed during both exercise (16%, P less than 0.01) and subsequent recovery periods (14%, P less than 0.02) compared with the NC group. A quasi-temporal relationship was observed between postexercise peak LV pressure potentiation and P-light chain phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that cardiac myosin P-light chain phosphorylation is associated, in part, with the augmentation of peak LV pressure observed during both exercise and recovery.\r"

  ".W": "Several groups of investigators are using external detection of radiolabeled protein to study the flux of protein from plasma into the pulmonary interstitium. A basic assumption for these studies has been that the unbound (free) tracer concentration is small and insignificant. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how free tracer influences the determination of normalized slope index. A five-compartment model for the lung was used with transport equations for both unbound and bound nuclide flux. Parameters of the unbound and bound transport equations were varied to evaluate the sensitivity of normalized slope index to each parameter. The model was also compared with published protein flux data to investigate the validity of the transport model. Application of the model to external scan data provides a sensitive method for evaluating the flux of bound and unbound tracers into the pulmonary interstitium. We conclude that because the distribution volume for unbound tracer is large with respect to protein distribution volume, even a small amount of unbound tracer (2-5%) can create large errors in the determination of normalized slope index.\r"

Immediately after the exercise, plasma free fatty acid (FFA) was elevated and glycogen concentrations were decreased. TG content was decreased 40% in STR muscle and reduced 45% in FTR muscle. The TG concentration of STR muscle increased in a linear fashion throughout recovery so that control levels were reached within the first 24 h after exercise. TG lipase activity of STR muscle was elevated 36% above control immediately after the swim and continued to increase to 84% above control 24 h after the work. In STR muscle there was a net synthesis of TG, while lipase activity was elevated above that measured in muscle of control rats. TG content of FTR muscle remained 45% below control throughout the first 24 h of recovery, and TG lipase activity increased from 26% (P greater than 0.05) greater than control immediately after exercise to threefold above control 24 h after work. All parameters returned to control levels by 48 h of recovery. These data indicated that a net TG synthesis occurs in STR muscle when lipolytic activity is elevated. In FTR muscle, however, a gradual increase in TG lipase activity that occurs during the first 24 h of recovery accompanies a TG concentration well below the control level throughout this same time frame.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The protocol consisted of three periods, each at least 1 h in duration. In experimental lungs, inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) was 28.2% in periods 1 and 3 and 4.2% in period 2. In control lungs, FIO2 was 28.2% throughout. Hypoxia increased pulmonary arterial pressure but did not alter peak tracheal pressure, lung lymph flow, or weight gain measured during the last 30 min of each period. SPLT activity was greatest in lung lymph and least in BAL fluid. Hypoxia did not alter SPLT activity in any fluid. Similar results were obtained in lungs not treated with indomethacin (n = 15). These data do not support the hypothesis that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is mediated by SPLTs.\r"

We found that before intrathecal injections of [D-Ala2]Met-enkephalinamide (100 micrograms in 0.2 ml), static contraction increased mean arterial pressure and ventilation by 32 +/- 5 (SE) mmHg and 227 +/- 61 (SE) ml/min, whereas after injection of this opioid peptide, static contraction increased mean arterial pressure and ventilation by only 15 +/- 5 mmHg and 37 +/- 33 ml/min, respectively. The attenuation of both the pressor and ventilatory responses to static contraction by [D-Ala2]Met-enkephalinamide were statistically significant (P less than 0.05). Moreover, the attenuation was probably not caused by an opioid-induced withdrawal of sympathetic outflow because [D-Ala2]Met-enkephalinamide had no effect on the pressor and ventilatory responses evoked by high-intensity electrical stimulation of the central cut end of the sciatic nerve. In addition, intrathecal injection of peptides that were highly selective agonists for either the opioid mu- or delta-receptor attenuated the reflex responses to static contraction. Naloxone (1,000 micrograms), injected intrathecally, prevented the attenuation of the reflex responses to contraction by opioid peptides. We speculate that the opioid-induced attenuation of the reflex pressor and ventilatory responses to static contraction may have been due to suppression of substance P release from group III and IV muscle afferents.\r"

To elucidate the underlying sources of error, five subjects performed spinal flexion-extension isovolume maneuvers and then performed Konno-Mead isovolume maneuvers at different lung volumes while erect, with the spine fully flexed, and at intermediate degrees of spinal flexion. RC and Ab dimensions were measured with respiratory inductance plethysmograph belts, and spinal flexion was assessed by a pair of magnetometers measuring the xiphi-Ab distance (Xi). RC and Ab volume-motion coefficients (alpha and beta, respectively) were calculated from the slope (-beta/alpha) of the Konno-Mead isovolume lines. We found that 1) spinal flexion with constant lung volume mainly increases the RC dimension, thereby displacing the Konno-Mead isovolume lines, and 2) spinal flexion decreases the -beta/alpha by decreasing beta. The error related to displacement averaged 28.4 +/- 15% of vital capacity, whereas the error related to changes in beta averaged 14 +/- 6% (SD). The systematic relationship of these errors with the degree of spinal flexion provides a mechanism whereby the addition of Xi to RC and Ab displacements significantly (P less than 0.001) improves volume estimates.\r"

However, the mechanism of this deterioration remains unclear because of the correlation with ventilatory and circulatory variables. Our hypothesis was that the decrease in the series dead space-to-tidal volume ratio during exercise might be partly responsible because mixing in the common dead space can reduce apparent inequality. We tested this notion in 10 resting anesthetized normocapnic dogs passively hyperventilated by increase tidal volume and a) inspired CO2 or b) external dead space. We predicted less apparent VA/Q inequality in condition b because of mixing in the added dead space. After base-line measurements, conditions a and b were randomly assigned, and after a second set of base-line measurements they were repeated in the reverse order in each dog. VA/Q inequality was measured by the multiple inert gas elimination technique. Comparison of conditions a and b demonstrated that additional external dead space improved (P less than 0.001) the blood flow distributions as hypothesized [log standard deviation of perfusion = 0.49 +/- 0.02 (SE) in condition b and 0.61 +/- 0.03 in condition a with respect to 0.52 +/- 0.03 at base line]. This study suggests that the increased tidal volume during exercise could uncover VA/Q inequality not evident at rest because of the higher ratio of common dead space to tidal volume at rest.\r"

Three-barreled ion-sensitive microelectrodes were used to measure direct-current potentials, potassium (aK+o) and calcium (aCa2+o) activities, and tissue PO2. During control, mean levels of aK+o and aCa2+o were 4.4 +/- 1.1 and 1.3 +/- 0.3 mM, respectively. During hypoxia, changes in aCa2+o were inconsistent, and aK+o revealed three phases: slow (phase I) and fast (phase II) rate of rise and a saturation level (phase III) at the group mean of 6.8 +/- 2.3 mM. Durations of phases I and II decreased, and their slopes increased with maturation. Hypoxia-related excitation of phrenic nerve activity (PHR) occurred during phase I, and gasplike PHR and/or apnea occurred during phases II and III. During recovery after hypoxia, PHR was independent of aK+o levels. Vagal nerve stimulation caused a rapid increase in aK+o followed by a continuous decay even though stimulation continued. Hypoxia had no significant effect on maximal aK+o increase. We concluded that ion homeostasis is less sensitive to the reduced availability of O2 shortly after birth than it is later in life. This age dependence may have an important role in the high resistance to lack of O2 during the early postnatal period in mammals.\r"

Ten normal subjects (aged 32.8 +/- 7.1 yr) performed symptom-limited incremental exercise tests in a ramp pattern on a cycle ergometer while breathing air and air with added carbon monoxide to cause HbCO to be approximately 11% and 20%. VO2max decreased by 11.6 and 19.3%, the metabolic acidosis threshold decreased by 11.9 and 19.6%, delta VO2/delta WR decreased by 8.9 and 14.0%, and S2 increased by 13.6 and 21.8% when HbCO was increased to 11 and 20%, respectively. Most importantly, VO2 was unchanged related to work rate below the metabolic acidosis threshold during the tests with increased HbCO but was reduced at the work rates above the metabolic acidosis threshold. These findings are consistent with the concept that the metabolic acidosis threshold is synonymous with an anaerobic threshold, i.e., the latter demarcating the VO2 above which the contracting muscles are not adequately supplied with O2 but below which they are.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between biochemical and physiological responses and tissue O2 during hypoxia was investigated in vivo in the dog brain by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Our findings demonstrate how ATP synthesis in the brain can be maintained during hypoxia because of compensatory changes in NADH, ADP, and Pi. Eleven beagle dogs were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated, and a steady-state graded hypoxia was induced by decreasing the fraction of inspired O2 (FIO2) stepwise at 20-min intervals. Biochemical metabolites were measured using 31P-NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. When sagittal sinus O2 partial pressure (PVO2) had decreased to 15 Torr, NADH increased by 30%, Pi increased by 50%, and phosphocreatine (PCr) decreased by 20%. In contrast, ATP remained constant. There was a 10% increase in ADP in dogs that maintained a steady temperature, but ADP decreased by as much as 30% in dogs in which body temperature decreased with the falling PVO2. PCr/Pi was logarithmically related to the phosphorylation potential during steady-state hypoxia. Compensation for the O2 lack is attributed to increases in ADP, Pi, and NADH as a result of the reciprocal relationship of the Michaelis-Menten equation. If the Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) of ADP, Pi, and O2 are the same as determined in vitro in mitochondria, the minimum brain cytosolic O2 capable of maintaining a steady-state ATP is near its Km (0.1 Torr) at a PVO2 of 7.5 Torr. At this critical O2 level, PCr/Pi is 0.9, intracellular pH is 6.75, phosphorylation potential is 38.5 mM-1, and the calculated maximum velocity of ATP formation by oxidative phosphorylation is 55% of normal.\r"

Lung volume changes were measured with a pressure plethysmograph, and pleural pressure was estimated by the use of a saline-filled esophageal catheter. We report data for normal awake hamsters studied at 18, 20, 22, 32, and 98 wk of age. Age-related differences were observed in tidal volume, dynamic compliance, and pulmonary resistance. To determine to what extent pulmonary mechanics are changed by anesthesia, hamsters were measured during spontaneous breathing while awake and while anesthetized. We found that anesthesia had a marked effect on the breathing pattern of normal hamsters. Twenty-five minutes after injection of pentobarbital sodium (70 mg/kg ip), tidal volume, dynamic compliance, pulmonary resistance, breathing frequency, and minute ventilation were 66, 40, 375, 60, and 41% of the corresponding awake values. Anesthesia always provoked a significant and dose-related decrease in tidal volume and an increase in respiratory period, together resulting in a profound decrease in minute ventilation. These significant differences from the awake values call into question the value of measurements in anesthetized animals. The methods described here yield reasonable and repeatable measurements and, because no anesthesia or surgery is required, they can be used in longitudinal studies when repeated measurements in the same animal over long periods of time can help define pathological changes or the effectiveness of various interventions.\r"

We assessed changes in lung mechanics, pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics, gas exchange, and the number and type of peripheral blood leukocytes.

The dogs were previously prepared with a permanent side-hole tracheal stoma and were trained to sleep with a tight-fitting snout mask, hermetically sealed in place, while breathing through a cuffed endotracheal tube inserted through the tracheostomy. Sleep state was determined by behavioral, electroencephalographic, and electromyographic criteria, and EMGgg activity was measured using fine bipolar electrodes inserted directly into the muscle. Oscillatory pressure waves of 30 Hz and +/- 3 cmH2O (tested at atmospheric and subatmospheric upper airway pressures) were applied at the dog's nostrils or larynx, either constantly for a period of 1 min or in 0.5-s bursts. We found that the pressure stimulus had two major effects. First, it was a potentially powerful arousal-promoting stimulus. Arousal occurred in 78% of tests in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and 55% of tests in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, with swallowing and sighing accompanying many of the arousals. Second, it produced an immediate and sustained augmentation of EMGgg, in wakefulness, SWS, and REM sleep. We conclude that oscillatory pressure waves in the upper airway, as found in snoring, produce reflex responses that help maintain upper airway patency during sleep. Loss of this type of reflex might contribute to the onset of obstructive sleep apnea in chronic snorers.\r"

CBF was measured on the ventral midtracheal surface of barbiturate-anesthetized eucapnically ventilated beagle dogs by heterodyne-mode laser light scattering. After base-line CBF was established, hexamethonium bromide (2 mg/kg iv), ipratropium bromide (0.5 microgram/kg iv), indomethacin (2 mg/kg iv), or intravenous 0.9% saline was administered. Aerosolized 3 Z 10(-9) M capsaicin in 0.9% saline was delivered for 2 min, and CBF was measured for the following 60 min. Control experiments used 0.9% saline sham aerosol with a 0.9% saline sham block. Aerosolized capsaicin stimulated CBF from a base line of 6.2 +/- 1.4 (SD) Hz (n = 230) to a mean maximum of 17.7 +/- 7.3 Hz (n = 16) 23 min after aerosol delivery, and CBF returned to base line within 60 min. Neither hexamethonium bromide, ipratropium bromide, nor indomethacin changed CBF from base-line values. The episodic CBF stimulatory response to capsaicin after commencement of aerosol was completely inhibited by hexamethonium bromide. Ipratropium bromide partially inhibited the first 15 min and totally inhibited the following 45 min of stimulatory response. Indomethacin inhibited the initial 15 min but had less effect on the following 45 min of stimulatory response. These data indicate that multiple stimulatory mechanisms function over a prolonged period of time to affect the removal of irritants from the airways and that these mechanisms differ from those involved in the maintenance of basal CBF.\r"

  ".W": "In anesthetized or decerebrate animals, negative pressure applied to the upper airway selectively activates the hypoglossal nerve compared with the phrenic nerve. Conversely, positive pressure reduces hypoglossal nerve activity out of proportion to any change in the phrenic neurogram. We have tested the hypothesis that analogous pressure changes applied to awake humans would selectively inhibit or activate genioglossal electromyographic (EMGge) activity relative to diaphragmatic electromyographic activity (EMGdi). We studied seven normal subjects in a head-out body plethysmograph. Pressure at the mouth was either atmospheric, +10 cmH2O, or -10 cmH2O, and lung volume was held constant by applying an identical pressure to the body surface. Thus the transmural pressure distorting the respiratory system was applied only to the upper airway. Subjects breathed CO2-enriched (2-3%) room air to stimulate phasic respiratory EMGge activity. We found that -10 cmH2O pressure applied selectively to the upper airway resulted in a 49% enhancement of peak-integrated EMGge activity, but EMGdi activity remained at control levels. Positive pressure did not result in any changes in EMGge or EMGdi activity. Neither pressure resulted in significant changes in the magnitude or pattern of ventilation. We conclude that reflex mechanisms maintaining upper airway patency are demonstrable in awake humans and probably have an important role in moment-to-moment modulation of upper airway muscle activity in normal awake humans.\r"

To test the effect of food restriction on ethane production rate, ethane exhalation was measured in rats with partial food restriction. Ethane production rate in room air in rats fed 60% of food consumed by ad libitum-fed animals for 2 wk was significantly reduced (3.50 +/- 0.25 vs. 5.21 +/- 0.34 pmol.min-1.100 g body wt-1, P less than 0.01). In 100% oxygen, ethane production in food-restricted rats was not different from that of ad libitum-fed rats (21.81 +/- 1.25 vs. 19.57 +/- 1.89 pmol.min-1.100 g-1). Fifteen hours of fasting compared with ad libitum feeding reduced ethane production modestly in room air (4.37 +/- 0.45 vs. 5.21 +/- 0.34 pmol.min-1.100 g-1) and more significantly in 100% oxygen (12.37 +/- 0.78 vs. 19.57 +/- 1.89 pmol.min-1.100 g-1). Thus, in 100% oxygen, 15 h of fasting, compared with ad libitum feeding, resulted in an approximately 40% decrease in ethane production rate. It is concluded that short-term food restriction significantly reduces ethane exhalation rate in rats when measured in room air.\r"

Stimulation was performed with subjects in the sitting position against an occluded airway from end expiration. Baseline gastric pressure and abdominal and rib cage configuration were kept constant. There was no significant difference in peak twitch Pdi from the relaxed diaphragm between control (38.8 +/- 3.3 cmH2O) and aminophylline (40.2 +/- 5.2 cmH2O) experiments. Other twitch characteristics including contraction time, half-relaxation time, and maximum relaxation rate were also unchanged. The Pdi-twitch amplitude at different levels of voluntary Pdi was measured with the twitch occlusion technique, and this relationship was found to be similar under control conditions and after aminophylline. With this technique, maximum Pdi (Pdimax) was calculated as the Pdi at which stimulation would result in no Pdi twitch because all motor units are already maximally activated. No significant change was found in mean calculated Pdimax between control (146.9 +/- 27.0 cmH2O) and aminophylline (149.2 +/- 26.0 cmH2O) experiments. We conclude from this study that the acute administration of aminophylline at therapeutic concentrations does not significantly affect contractility or maximum strength of the normal human diaphragm in vivo.\r"

After 10 wk of exercise and dietary restriction, the MR-CC and MR-E rats weighed 84 and 86%, respectively, of AL-CC, whereas the SR-CC and SR-E rats weighed 66 and 68% of AL-CC. Dietary restriction and subsequent weight loss produced significant reductions in both total and resting daily energy expenditure. Exercise partially reversed this effect, but the extent of this reversal diminished as the severity of dietary restriction was increased. These results raise the distinct possibility that inconsistencies in the current literature concerning the effects of exercise on whole body metabolism during periods of dietary restriction might be reconciled by an appreciation and an understanding of the influence that duration of exercise training and severity of food restriction have on this measure.\r"

Rats exposed to an ambient temperature (Ta) of 26 degrees C displayed a decrease in rectal temperature (Tre) of 0.95 +/- 0.12 degrees C (SE) after injection with PGE (100 micrograms/kg ip). Hypothermia was produced mainly by heat losses, as indicated by increases in tail blood flow. At Ta of 4 degrees C, PGE produced a comparable fall in Tre of 1.00 +/- 0.14 degrees C. However, in the cold the hypothermia was caused solely by decreases in heat production. These results indicate that the PGE-induced hypothermia is not the result of a peripheral vasodilation induced by the direct action of PGE on the tail vascular smooth muscle but is a central nervous system-mediated response of the thermoregulatory system induced by PGE within the peritoneal cavity. Capsaicin injected subcutaneously induces a transient hypothermia in rats because of stimulation of the warm receptors. If administered peripherally in sufficient amounts, it is reputed to impair peripheral warm receptors so that they become desensitized to the hypothermic effects of capsaicin. We measured PGE-induced hypothermias in rats both before and after capsaicin desensitization at Ta of 26 degrees C. Before desensitization the hypothermia was -1.14 +/- 0.12 degrees C, whereas after capsaicin treatment the PGE-induced hypothermia was -0.34 +/- 0.17 degrees C. The biological effects of capsaicin are diverse; however, based on current thinking about the thermoregulatory effects of capsaicin desensitization, our results indicate that peripheral warm receptor pathways are in some manner implicated in the hypothermia induced by intraperitoneal PGE.\r"

For 4 h, we volume loaded 24 anesthetized ventilated sheep with one side, both sides, or neither side of the chest open. During the experiment, we collected visceral pleural liquid from a bag surrounding the exposed lung and lung lymph; after the experiment, we collected peribronchovascular cuff liquid. We found that during volume loading visceral pleural liquid flow increased significantly by 2 h, and its protein concentration over the final hour was the same as that of lung interstitial liquids. The volume of visceral pleural liquid correlated with excess lung water and wedge pressure elevation. By our estimates, clearance of edema from the lung into the pleural space constituted 23-29% of all edema liquid collected, similar to measured lymph edema clearance. We conclude that edema liquid leaks directly from edematous sheep lungs into the pleural space and that this leakage provides an important additional route of edema clearance.\r"

  ".W": "Local injection of substance P (SP) into the ventral portion of the nucleus gigantocellularis, nucleus reticularis lateralis, and nucleus retrofacialis of the ventrolateral medulla oblongata (VLM) or direct application on the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata caused marked stimulation of tidal volume (VT) and/or minute ventilation (VE). The ventilatory response to hypoxia was significantly blunted after SP in the VLM but not in the dorsal medulla oblongata (DM) (nucleus tractus solitarius). The SP antagonist [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]SP almost completely inhibited this response when applied locally to a wide area of the superficial layer of the VLM but not of the DM. Unilateral or bilateral application of 0.3-1.5 nmol of the SP antagonist in the VLM (corpus trapezoideum and the caudal region extending from the rootlets of the nucleus hypoglossus to the first cervical segment) markedly attenuated the response to a 5% CO2 inhalation. The inhibition of the CO2 response was seen after [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]SP in the rostral areas of the medulla oblongata corresponding to the corpus trapezoideum and the caudal region extending from the rootlets of the nucleus hypoglossus to the first cervical segment of the cervical cord. Electric somatosensory-induced ventilatory stimulation could be depressed by approximately 70% by [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]SP locally applied on the surface of the VLM. We conclude that SP is involved in the hypoxic, hypercapnic, and somatosensory ventilatory responses in the rat. However, these respiratory reflexes are mediated via different neuronal pools in the medulla oblongata, mainly the VLM.\r"

Measurements of mouth pressure (Pm) (or flow rate, V) and neck CSA changes during respiratory efforts against a high (or infinite) resistance have shown a highly significant relationship between Pm changes (or V changes, respectively), reflecting CSA changes of the EA and CSA changes of the neck. Simultaneous measurements of CSA of the neck (by IP) and of EA (by computerized tomography) during sustained inspiratory and expiratory efforts against a closed airway showed a high correlation between changes in the former and latter structures. Changes in CSA of the neck were larger with positive than negative transmural pressures, in keeping with the known larger compliance of this airway during expiration. We found this method helpful to assess the behavior of the EA during obstructive apnea episodes, hypopneas, and snoring.\r"

Fourteen of them were included in a retrospective review of 474 consecutive total hip replacements without cement in 441 patients who had been followed for at least two years. The criteria for inclusion in the study were focal osteolysis with a femoral component that appeared stable radiographically, and no subsidence or change of position of the implant. All but two patients were men and were quite active. The average age was forty-seven years (range, twenty to sixty-five years). Fourteen of the sixteen patients had an excellent clinical result (a Harris hip score of 90 points or more). In two patients, the hip replacement was revised and, in a third, a biopsy was done. In all three patients, the implant was found to be firmly fixed to the femur. In the two hips that were revised, extensive ingrowth of bone was demonstrated histologically, there was no evidence of infection, and a well defined fibrous membrane was found around the smooth portion of the stem. The histological specimens from these two hips contained focal aggregates of macrophages with particulate polyethylene and metallic debris. In the biopsy material from the hip that was not revised, a fine fibrous membrane lined a cystic cavity. Although the membrane contained an occasional macrophage, no foreign material was identified. Trabecular microfracture and osteoclastic resorption of bone were seen next to the fibrous lining. With one exception, osteolysis was not identified less than two years postoperatively. In most patients, osteolysis appeared after three years. This study showed that femoral osteolysis can occur around uncemented components.\r"

There were fewer and less severe early postoperative complications in the surface-replacement group, but the rate of long-term failure (revision or resection) was substantially higher. Survivorship analysis demonstrated that neither type of operation yielded durable results in younger patients; all revisions were in patients who were less than sixty years old.

Twenty (43 per cent) of the hips could not be reduced closed, and an open reduction was needed. After the reduction, all of the involved hips were immobilized in the so-called human position (marked flexion and slight abduction). At a minimum follow-up of two years, osteonecrosis of the femoral head had developed in only two hips (4 per cent). Patients who were more than one year old when the hip was reduced had a higher incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head and were more likely to need reconstructive procedures later. Patients who were more than eighteen months old at the time of the attempted closed reduction were more likely to need an open reduction of the hip. Treatment of congenital dislocation of the hip in young children remains an extremely complex problem. It has not been clearly established that the use of preliminary traction decreases the incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head or improves the outcome of treatment. In our experience, uncomplicated (non-teratological, postnatal) congenital dislocation of the hip has been safely treated with either open or closed reduction without preliminary traction in patients who were younger than two years old, provided that the reduction could be obtained without excessive force.\r"

  ".W": "In a review of the results of toxin assays, twenty-five orthopaedic patients who had a Clostridium difficile infection and associated diarrhea were identified. The infection was due to the use of antibiotics in all but one patient. Seventeen patients had received the antibiotics prophylactically. The two most commonly implicated antibiotics were cefazolin and clindamycin, because those drugs had been commonly used for prophylaxis at the study institutions. However, other antibiotics were implicated. There was a positive correlation between the delay in diagnosis and the severity of the illness. A white blood-cell count of more than 20 x 10(9) per liter indicated severe disease in our survey. The possibility of Clostridium difficile infection should be considered in patients who have signs and symptoms that mimic those of intestinal obstruction. Patients who have an unexplained fever or high white blood-cell count and in whom diarrhea develops in the postoperative period should be treated immediately with metronidazole, and a specimen of stool should be obtained for an assay for Clostridium difficile toxin. If the diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection is confirmed by the presence of toxin in the stool and the patient has persistent, severe diarrhea, oral administration of vancomycin should be added to the regimen. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis should be minimized to decrease the risk of Clostridium difficile colitis.\r"

Nineteen patients had complete clinical and radiographic evaluation, with an average follow-up of five years (range, two to seven and one-half years). The slip angle averaged 71 degrees preoperatively, was corrected to an average of 31 degrees by reduction, and averaged 28 degrees at follow-up. The average preoperative percentage of slippage (98 per cent) did not change substantially. A pseudarthrosis developed in four patients, all of whom had a reoperation. The neurological deficits that had been present in ten patients preoperatively had completely resolved in all but one at follow-up. One patient had a cauda equina syndrome and two patients had a neuropathy of the root of the fifth lumbar nerve as a result of the reduction; complete recovery occurred in two patients and partial recovery, in one. Alignment in the sagittal plane was restored in seventeen patients, and the back pain and radicular symptoms were relieved in all patients except one who had had those symptoms preoperatively.\r"

  ".U": "90346877\r", 
  ".W": "It has been generally accepted that mechanical stimulation is an important factor in the promotion of formation of bone. Fracture-healing consists of periosteal bridging of the fracture, which achieves stability, and proliferation of endosteal bone to fill the defects between the ends of the bone. To evaluate the effect of weight-bearing on bone-healing, an operatively created defect in the tibial cortex was chosen as an experimental model. In one set of dogs (Group 1), a bilateral defect in the tibial cortex was created and weight-bearing was permitted on one tibia but not on the opposite one. In Group 2, a bilateral defect in the tibial cortex was made and weight-bearing was allowed on both tibiae. A third group of dogs of similar age (Group 3) had no tibial defects. Quantitative histomorphometry was used to measure formation and porosity of bone. Weight-bearing was measured with both static and dynamic techniques. Significantly less woven bone formed in the defects in the non-weight-bearing tibiae than in the weight-bearing tibiae. This appeared to be due to a disuse response in the underloaded tibiae, in which less bone formed, rather than to the formation of more bone in the weight-bearing tibiae. The data suggest that weight-bearing is a permissive factor, not a stimulus, for formation of woven bone in a tibial defect. Clinical Relevance: This animal model supports the concept that lack of weight-bearing decreases the amount of woven bone that is formed in a healing tibial defect. The results of this study indicate that weight-bearing increases the formation of bone in fracture-healing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For the present study, seven patients who had low-back pain and ten volunteers who had been carefully screened, with a questionnaire and a physical examination, to ensure that they had no history of problems with the back, had an injection at three levels, and all sessions were videotaped. After each injection, the participant was interviewed about the pattern and intensity of the pain, and then the discs were imaged with computed tomography. Five raters, who were blind to the condition of the participant, graded each disc as normal or abnormal on the basis of findings on magnetic resonance images that had been made before the injection and computed tomography (discography) were done. There was only one disagreement between the ratings that were made on the basis of the magnetic resonance images and those that were made on the basis of the discograms. Each participant's pain-related response was evaluated independently by two raters who viewed the videotapes of the discography. Inter-rater reliability was 0.99, 0.93, and 0.88 for the evaluation of intensity of the pain, pain-related behavior, and similarity of the pain to pain that the subject had had before the injection. In the asymptomatic individuals, the discogram was interpreted as abnormal for 17 per cent (five) of the thirty discs and for five of the ten subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90347032\r", 
  ".W": "Propagation of venous thrombi or rethrombosis after coronary thrombolytic therapy can occur despite heparin administration. To explore potential mechanisms, we set out to determine whether clot-bound thrombin is relatively protected from inhibition by heparin-antithrombin III but susceptible to inactivation by antithrombin III-independent inhibitors. Using plasma fibrinopeptide A (FPA) levels as an index of thrombin activity, we compared the ability of thrombin inhibitors to block FPA release mediated by fluid-phase thrombin with their activity against the clot-bound enzyme. Incubation of thrombin with citrated plasma results in concentration-dependent FPA generation, which reaches a plateau within minutes. In contrast, there is progressive FPA generation when fibrin clots are incubated with citrated plasma. Heparin, hirudin, hirudin dodecapeptide (hirugen), and D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) produce concentration-dependent inhibition of FPA release mediated by fluid-phase thrombin. However, heparin is much less effective at inhibiting thrombin bound to fibrin because a 20-fold higher concentration is necessary to block 70% of the activity of the clot-bound enzyme than is required for equivalent inhibition of fluid-phase thrombin (2.0 and 0.1 U/ml, respectively). In contrast, hirugen and PPACK are equally effective inhibitors of fluid- and solid-phase thrombin, while hirudin is only 50% as effective against the clot-bound enzyme. None of the inhibitors displace bound 125I-labeled thrombin from the clot. These studies indicate that (a) clot-bound thrombin is relatively protected from inhibition by heparin, possibly because the heparin binding site on thrombin is inaccessible when the enzyme is bound to fibrin, and (b) clot-bound thrombin is susceptible to inactivation by antithrombin III-independent inhibitors because the sites of their interaction are not masked by thrombin binding to fibrin. For these reasons, antithrombin III-independent inhibitors may be more effective than heparin in certain clinical settings.\r"

The frequencies of DR9 and DRw13 were significantly increased in the patients who developed MG before 3 yr of age. The DQw3 antigen was positive for all the patients that developed MG before 15 yr with only one exception. All the examined cases that developed MG before 3 yr (including this DQw3 negative patient) had the same DQA and DQB DNA restriction fragments. These HLA frequencies decreased as the age of onset increased, and no significant association was observed in adult-onset MG. No patients had B8, DR3, and DQw2. The relative risk was higher for the DR9/DRw13 heterozygotes (37.4) than for DR9 (16.4) or DRw13 (7.1) in the childhood-onset MG. Statistical analysis suggested that DR9 and DRw13 (or DQw1 and DQw3) act synergistically in the disease development. Family study revealed diverse DR9 haplotypes. The most frequent DRw13 haplotype was Bw44-BFF-C4A3B1-DRw13-DQw1, which may be evolutionarily related to the caucasian B8-DR3-DQw2 haplotype. These results showed that MG in early childhood in Japanese individuals is genetically different from that in adulthood and that in caucasians.\r"

Aspirin (10(-5) M) potentiated histamine-, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP)-, forskolin- and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine-stimulated acid secretion without affecting basal acid secretion. Augmentation of secretagogue-stimulated acid secretion by aspirin was dependent on calcium (Ca2+) since potentiation was blocked by removal of extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o) or addition of the calcium antagonist lanthanum chloride. Using the Ca2+ probe fura-2, aspirin (10(-6) - 2 X 10(-5) M) rapidly increased intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a dose-dependent manner. The source of released Ca2+ was intracellular as demonstrated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ and [Ca2+]o with EGTA washing. Aspirin did not affect several other signal transduction sites involved in stimulus-secretion coupling, including the H2 receptor, intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), inositol 1,4,5, triphosphate (IP3) and H+,K(+)-ATPase. Aspirin decreased PC prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) content by 98%. Exogenous dimethyl PGE2 (dmPGE2) inhibited both histamine-stimulated acid secretion and its enhancement by aspirin. In contrast, dmPGE2 abolished aspirin-induced potentiation of dbcAMP-stimulated acid secretion by augmenting the dbcAMP-stimulated response. These results indicate that aspirin acts at a site beyond the adenylate cyclase/cAMP system and before the proton pump, presumably by releasing Ca2+ from an IP3-independent intracellular storage pool and by inhibiting PGE2 generation.\r"

  ".U": "90347036\r", 
  ".W": "FcRIII (the CD16-antigen), a low affinity receptor for IgG, is expressed by neutrophils, natural killer lymphocytes, and macrophages. We have developed a sensitive radioimmunoassay to quantify FcRIII. A soluble form of FcRIII was identified in human plasma. Immunoprecipitation of FcRIII from plasma showed that the plasma form of FcRIII has an identical electrophoretic mobility as the FcRIII expressed by neutrophils. Moreover, the plasma form of FcRIII exhibited the same polymorphism as does the neutrophil FcRIII. The neutrophil expresses the phosphatidylinositol-linked form of FcRIII, encoded by the gene FcRIII-1. Because it is not known whether this gene is also active in nonhematopoietic cells, we analyzed patients with an acquired clonal disorder of their hematopoietic cells, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH patients appeared to have a strongly reduced expression of FcRIII on their neutrophils. The concentration of FcRIII in the plasma of these patients was also reduced, indicating that plasma FcRIII originates from neutrophils. A patient deficient in FcRIII-1 but with a normal expression of FcRIII-2 had no soluble FcRIII in her plasma, also indicating that plasma FcRIII originates from neutrophils. The electrophoretic mobility of the protein backbone of plasma FcRIII and FcRIII released by activated neutrophils was identical, whereas deglycosylated FcRIII obtained from a lysate of neutrophils migrated slower. This indicates that plasma FcRIII originates from activation-induced release by neutrophils. Stimulation of neutrophils or neutrophil cytoplasts (closed membrane vesicles filled with cytoplasm) with low concentrations of FMLP (10(-9)-10(-8) M) or phorbol myristate acetate (1-10 ng/ml) induced a dose-dependent release of FcRIII. The plasma concentration of FcRIII was relatively constant (range 40-280% of the mean). Soluble FcRIII was also detected in inflamed joint fluids of arthritis patients, suggesting that FcRIII is also released by activated neutrophils in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the role of alpha adrenoceptors in the internal anal sphincter (IAS). Studies wer performed on alpha-chloralose anesthetized opossums. Resting pressure in the IAS (IASP) was recorded using low compliant continuously perfused catheters. The effects of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist clonidine and their corresponding selective antagonists, prazosin and yohimbine, respectively, were examined on the resting IASP, and on rectal balloon distension (RBD)-mediated IAS relaxation. Phenylephrine caused a rise in the IASP that was blocked by prazosin and not by yohimbine. Phenylephrine had no effect on IAS relaxation caused by RBD. Clonidine on the other hand caused significant suppression of IAS relaxation in response to RBD, but caused minimal changes in the resting IASP. The suppression of IAS relaxation by clonidine was selectively antagonized by yohimbine but not by prazosin. From these studies we conclude that alpha-2 adrenoceptors exert important neuromodulatory influences on rectoanal inhibitory reflex, while alpha-1 adrenoceptors may exert modulatory effects on the resting IAS tone.\r"

  ".W": "Acute PTH administration enhances final urine acidification in the rat. HCl was infused during 3 h in rats to determine the parathyroid and renal responses to acute metabolic acidosis. Serum immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) concentration significantly increased and nephrogenous adenosine 3H,5H-cyclic monophosphate tended to increase during HCl loading in intact and adrenalectomized (ADX) rats despite significant increments in plasma ionized calcium. Strong linear relationships existed between serum iPTH concentration and arterial bicarbonate or proton concentration (P less than 0.0001). Serum iPth concentration and NcAMP remained stable in intact time-control rats and decreased in CaCl2-infused, nonacidotic animals. Urinary acidification was markedly reduced in parathyroidectomized (PTX) as compared with intact rats during both basal and acidosis states; human PTH-(1-34) infusion in PTX rats restored in a dose-dependent manner the ability of the kidney to acidify the urine and excrete net acid. Acidosis-induced increase in urinary net acid excretion was observed in intact, PTX, and ADX, but not in ADX-thyroparathyroidectomized rats. We conclude that (a) acute metabolic acidosis enhances circulating PTH activity, and (b) PTH markedly contributes to the renal response against acute metabolic acidosis by enhancing urinary acidification.\r"

ADA from T.D. T cells had normal Km, heat stability, and sensitivity to ADA inhibitors. Examination of HLA phenotype and polymorphic DNA loci indicated that T.D. was neither chimeric nor a genetic mosaic. Amplified and subcloned ADA cDNA from ADA+ T.D. T cells was shown by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to possess the same mutations (Arg101----Trp, Arg211----His) previously found in the ADA-T.D. B cell line GM 2606 (Akeson, A. L., D. A. Wiginton, M. R. Dusing, J. C. States, and J. J. Hutton. 1988. J. Biol. Chem. 263:16291-16296). Our findings suggest that one of these mutant alleles can be expressed selectively in IL-2-dependent T cells as stable, active enzyme. Cultured T cells from other patients with the Arg211----His mutation did not express significant ADA activity, while some B cell lines from a patient with an Arg101----Gln mutation have been found to express normal ADA activity. We speculate that Arg101 may be at a site that determines degradation of ADA by a protease that is under negative control by IL-2 in T cells, and is variably expressed in B cells. Il-2 might increase ADA expression in T cells of patients who possess mutations of Arg101.\r"

  ".W": "In this prospective study of 45 patients, we tested the hypothesis that markedly elevated levels of plasma von Willebrand antigen (vWf-Ag) a marker of endothelial cell injury, might predict the development of acute lung injury in patients with nonpulmonary sepsis syndrome. Acute lung injury was quantified on a four-point scoring system. At the time of entry into the study, none of the 45 patients had evidence of lung injury. Subsequently, 15 patients developed lung injury and 30 patients did not develop lung injury. The mean plasma vWf-Ag level was markedly elevated in the 15 patients who developed lung injury compared with the 30 patients who did not develop lung injury (588 +/- 204 vs. 338 +/- 196, percentage of control, P less than 0.01). Furthermore, a plasma vWf-Ag level greater than or equal to 450 was 87% sensitive and 77% specific for predicting the development of acute lung injury in the setting of nonpulmonary sepsis. In addition, the combination of a plasma vWf-Ag greater than 450 and nonpulmonary organ failure at the time of entry into the study had a positive predictive value of 80% for acute lung injury. Also, a plasma vWf-Ag level greater than 450 had a positive predictive value of 80% for identifying nonsurvivors. Thus, in patients with nonpulmonary sepsis, an elevated level of plasma vWf-Ag is a useful, early biochemical marker of endothelial injury and it has both predictive and prognostic value.\r"

These cells, grown on permeable supports in primary culture, grow to confluence and develop a transmonolayer voltage oriented such that the apical surface is negative with respect to the basal surface. The results of these experiments demonstrate that this voltage is predominantly (or exclusively) the result of electrogenic Na+ absorption. Na+ transport can be stimulated two- to fourfold by exposure to either dexamethasone or aldosterone (100 nM). Experiments using specific antagonists of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors indicate that activation of either receptor stimulates electrogenic Na+ transport; electroneutral Na+ transport is undetectable. Two other features of the IMCD emerge from these studies. (a) These cells appear to have the capacity to metabolize the naturally occurring glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone. (b) The capacity for K+ secretion is minimal and steroid hormones do not induce or stimulate conductive K+ secretion as they do in the cortical collecting duct.\r"

The maximum isometric force of papillary muscles normalized per cross-sectional area rose markedly (+42%, P less than 0.05 vs. controls), whereas the maximum unloaded shortening velocity did not change. This was observed despite a marked isomyosin shift towards V3 (32 +/- 5% vs. 8 +/- 2% in controls, P less than 0.001). Increased curvature of the force-velocity relationship (+64%, P less than 0.05 vs. controls) indicated that the muscles contracted more economically, suggesting the involvement of V3 myosin. Total calcium- and actin-activated myosin ATPase activities assayed on quickly frozen left ventricular sections were similar in tumor-bearing rats and in controls. After alkaline preincubation, these activities only decreased in tumor-bearing rats, demonstrating that V3 enzymatic sites were involved in total ATPase activity. These data demonstrate that chronic GH hypersecretion in the rat leads to a unique pattern of myocardial adaptation which allows the muscle to improve its contractile performance and economy simultaneously, thanks to myosin phenoconversion and an increase in the number of active enzymatic sites.\r"

Mutations of spectrin and protein 4.1 are associated with elliptocytosis or spherocytosis and anemia of varying severity. We analyzed two mutant protein 4.1 molecules associated with elliptocytosis: a high molecular weight 4.1 (95 kD) associated with mild elliptocytosis without anemia, and a low molecular weight 4.1 (two species at 68 and 65 kD) associated with moderate elliptocytosis and anemia. 4.1(95) was found to contain a approximately 15-kD insertion adjacent to the spectrin/actin binding domain comprised, at least in part, of repeated sequence. 4.1(68/65) was found to lack the entire spectrin-actin binding domain. The mechanical stability of erythrocyte membranes containing 4.1(95) was identical to that of normal membranes, consistent with the presence of an intact spectrin-actin binding domain in protein 4.1. In contrast, membranes containing 4.1(68/65) have markedly reduced mechanical stability as a result of deleting the spectrin-actin binding domain. The mechanical stability of these membranes was improved following reconstitution with normal 4.1. These studies have thus enabled us to establish the importance of the spectrin-actin binding domain in regulating the mechanical stability of the erythrocyte membrane.\r"

The preceding companion paper presents a biochemical study of two abnormal protein 4.1 species from individuals with the red blood cell disorder, hereditary elliptocytosis. These variants, \"protein 4.1(68/65)\" and \"protein 4.1(95),\" have altered molecular weights due to internal deletions and duplications apparently localized around the spectrin-actin binding domain. Here we use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques to clone and sequence the corresponding mutant reticulocyte mRNAs, and correlate the deletion/duplication end points with exon boundaries of the gene. Protein 4.1(68/65) mRNA lacks sequences encoding the functionally important spectrin-actin binding domain due to a 240 nucleotide (nt) deletion spanning the codons for Lys407-Gly486. Protein 4.1(95) mRNA encodes a protein with two spectrin-actin binding domains by virtue of a 369 nt duplication of codons for Lys407-Gln529. These deletions and duplications correspond to gene rearrangements involving three exons encoding 21, 59, and 43 amino acids, respectively. The duplicated 21 amino acid exon in the 4.1(95) gene retains its proper tissue-specific expression pattern, being spliced into reticulocyte 4.1 mRNA and out of lymphocyte 4.1 mRNA.\r"

To study the mechanism of this inhibition, the effect of rTNF on highly purified human CFU-erythroid (E) (mean purity 63.5%), which were generated from peripheral blood burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E), was compared to its effect on unpurified human marrow CFU-E (mean purity 0.21%). Although growth of colonies from marrow CFU-E was inhibited by rTNF, no significant effect on purified BFU-E-derived CFU-E colony growth was found. Removal of accessory marrow cells by soy bean agglutinin (SBA) ablated the inhibition of marrow CFU-E colonies by rTNF. Inhibition of colony growth was then restored by adding back SBA+ cells, but not by adding T lymphocytes or adherent cells. Conditioned medium prepared from bone marrow mononuclear cells stimulated by rTNF inhibited the growth of colonies from highly purified BFU-E derived CFU-E resistant to direct inhibition by rTNF. These findings indicate that rTNF does not directly inhibit CFU-E, but requires accessory cells to decrease erythropoiesis. These accessory cells reside in the SBA+ cell fraction, but are neither T cells nor adherent cells. Therefore, in order to produce anemia, TNF must induce release or production of a factor that directly inhibits erythroid colony growth.\r"

In the present studies, we have examined GLUT-4 mRNA and protein concentrations in muscle after variations in the metabolic status of the intact animal (i.e., 7 d streptozotocin-induced diabetes, 7 d insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and 3 d fasting). These changes in glucose homeostasis were associated with the following changes in GLUT-4 gene products: a decrease of approximately 30% in both mRNA and protein with diabetes; a 50% increase in mRNA and a 2.4-fold increase in protein with insulin injection; and normal mRNA in spite of a 2.7-fold increase in protein with fasting. Fasted diabetics exhibited an increase of 50% in GLUT-4 mRNA and a 2.4-fold increase in protein relative to fed diabetics. In diabetic and insulin-injected groups, the changes in GLUT-4 protein were similar to changes in mRNA, but in fasting, GLUT-4 protein increased without a concomitant change in mRNA. Overall there was no correlation between muscle concentrations of GLUT-4 protein and mRNA. Muscle GLUT-4 protein concentration tended to correlate with plasma glucose (r = -0.57, P less than 0.001), but not with plasma insulin. These results indicate that (a) chronic changes in glucose homeostasis are associated with changes in expression of GLUT-4 protein in muscle; (b) GLUT-4 protein increased in fasted soleus muscle without change in mRNA, thereby differing from fasted adipocytes in which both GLUT-4 products diminish; and (c) no simple relationship exists between total muscle GLUT-4 protein content and whole-body insulin sensitivity.\r"

Increased susceptibility to trypsin enhances cleavage of the alpha spectrin chain, yielding an increased amount of the alpha I 74-kD fragment at the expense of the alpha I 80-kD parent fragment. Recently we showed that the mutations causing the Sp alpha I/74 abnormality may lie in the alpha- or the beta-chain, and that spectrin Culoz and spectrin Lyon were two (alpha I/74) alpha-variants, respectively. We now show that the spectrin Culoz alpha I domain undergoes prominent tryptic cleavage after Lys 42, whereas cleavage prevails after Arg 39 in spectrin Lyon. Applying the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to exon 2 of the spectrin alpha I domain, we have established that the mutation responsible for spectrin Culoz is alpha I 40 Gly----Val; GGT----GTT. Applying the PCR technique to the cDNA derived from reticulocyte mRNA, we have shown that the mutation responsible for spectrin Lyon is alpha I 43 Leu----Phe; CTT----TTT. Studies of normal controls and of family members using dot blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes confirmed these results. Variants such as spectrin Culoz and spectrin Lyon should provide insight into a region that participates in spectrin dimer self-association and whose susceptibility to proteolysis must reflect subtle conformational changes.\r"

To test the hypothesis that chymase modulates histamine-induced plasma extravasation, we measured wheal formation following intradermal injection of purified mast cell chymase and histamine into the skin of ragweed-allergic dogs. We found that chymase greatly augments histamine-induced wheal formation. The magnitude of the potentiating effect increases with increasing doses of chymase and becomes maximal approximately 30 min after administration. Injection of chymase without histamine does not evoke wheal formation. The chymase potentiation of histamine-induced skin responses is prevented completely by pretreatment with the H1-receptor antagonist pyrilamine, and is prevented by inactivation of chymase with soybean trypsin inhibitor, suggesting that both histamine and preserved catalytic activity are required for the effects of chymase. To examine the effects of histamine and chymase released in situ in further experiments, we measured wheal size following local degranulation of mast cells by intradermal injection of ragweed antigen or compound 48/80. We found that pretreatment with either soybean trypsin inhibitor or pyrilamine markedly reduces ragweed antigen- or 48/80-induced wheal formation, supporting the results obtained by injection of exogenous chymase and histamine. These findings suggest a novel and important proinflammatory role for chymase in modulating the effects of histamine on vascular permeability during mast cell activation.\r"

We then investigated the role of transcriptional and translational events in mediating these actions of IGF-I. LH bound to saturable, high affinity binding sites on rat ovarian theca-interstitial cells. Preincubation with LH produced a decrease in LH binding capacity with no effect on LH binding affinity. Treatment with IGF-I, both in the absence and presence of LH, increased LH binding capacity 1.5- to 2-fold with no change in LH binding affinity. Androgen production was increased progressively by LH, suggesting that LH-stimulated steroidogenesis is not tightly coupled to LH receptor downregulation. IGF-I increased androgen synthesis in proportion to its upregulation of LH binding capacity. Transcriptional inhibition with dichlorobenzimidazole riboside inhibited the IGF-I-mediated increase in LH binding capacity but had no effect on androgen production. Translational inhibition with cycloheximide inhibited both the IGF-I-mediated increase in LH binding and stimulation of androgen synthesis. We conclude that IGF-I increases theca-interstitial cell LH binding capacity and reverses the LH-induced downregulation of LH binding sites. The enhancement of LH binding by IGF-I is compatible with transcriptional mediation whereas the effect of IGF-I on androgen synthesis appears to be mediated by a direct effect of the peptide on the translational process(es) involved in steroidogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether vasoconstriction distal to the site of successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is a result of altered autoregulation in a hypoperfused coronary artery, we examined the association of this distal vasoconstriction with lesion severity in 20 patients. Lesion severity was classified as moderate, severe or critical (greater than 1.0, 0.5-1.0, and less than 0.5 mm, respectively). Quantitative coronary measurements were made at 3, 15, and 30 min after PTCA, and then after intracoronary (IC) nitroglycerin, in coronary segments distal to the dilated lesion (distal) and in a nonmanipulated vessel (control). Coronary vasoconstriction in the Distal segment after PTCA correlated with lesion severity, with 14 +/- 4%, 28 +/- 2%, and 41 +/- 5% vasoconstriction (vs. IC nitroglycerin, 30 min after PTCA) in the moderate, severe and critical lesion severity subgroups, respectively (P less than 0.01 for critical or severe vs. moderate). This vasoconstriction was significantly greater than that observed in the corresponding control segment for patients with severe (P less than 0.01), and critical (P less than 0.001) lesions. These findings suggest that hypoperfused human epicardial coronary arteries \"reset\" their autoregulatory responsiveness and that distal vasoconstriction after PTCA is the result of this altered autoregulation. These findings have clinical implications concerning the etiology, prophylaxis and treatment of coronary spams after PTCA and coronary bypass surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is an important regulator of the acute phase response, T cell function, and terminal B cell differentiation. Excessive or inappropriate production of this cytokine may be involved in a variety of autoimmune and neoplastic disorders. To investigate the consequences of dysregulated synthesis of IL-6 in vivo, a high-titer recombinant retroviral vector produced in psi-2 packaging cells was used to introduce the coding sequences of murine IL-6 into mouse hematopoietic cells. Congenitally anemic W/Wv mice reconstituted with bone marrow cells transduced with the retroviral vector developed a syndrome characterized by anemia, transient granulocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, with marked splenomegaly and peripheral lymphadenopathy. Extensive plasma cell infiltration of lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and lung was noted. The similarity of these findings to those of multicentric Castleman's disease, taken together with the observation that lymph nodes from these patients elaborate large amounts of this cytokine, suggest that the inappropriate synthesis of IL-6 has a primary role in the pathogenesis of this systemic lymphoproliferative disorder.\r"

  ".U": "90347059\r", 
  ".W": "It has been established previously that nephrotic hyperlipidemia is characterized by both an increase in lipid synthesis and a defect in removal of lipoproteins. The relationship between these defects and altered albumin metabolism is uncertain. One hypothesis is that hepatic lipogenesis increases in parallel with albumin synthesis. To test this hypothesis, albumin synthesis was increased in nephrotic rats fed an 8.5% protein diet (LPN) by increasing dietary protein to 40% (HPN). Proteinuria was modulated in half of the rats fed 40% protein by enalapril (HPE). Albumin synthesis was the same in both HPN and HPE, but proteinuria was reduced in HPE compared to HPN, and so were serum cholesterol and triglycerides (TG). To examine the effect of serum albumin on lipid clearance in the absence of proteinuria, plasma clearance of chylomicrons (CM) and VLDL was measured in Nagase analbuminemic rats (NAR) and found to be no different than in normal SD rats. When proteinuria was induced in NAR and in SD rats, a severe and identical defect in both CM and VLDL clearance was acquired in both groups and blood lipid levels were increased to a similar degree in both groups. Neither hyperlipidemia nor defective removal of lipoproteins from the circulation are linked to albumin synthesis or serum albumin concentration but result, at least in part, from proteinuria. Postheparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was reduced slightly in nephrotic animals compared to nonnephrotic controls, but the most striking finding was a highly significant decrease in postheraprin LPL activity in normal NAR compared to SD rats (P less than 0.001), suggesting that reduced LPL activity is not responsible for reduced clearance of CM and VLDL in nephrotic rats.\r"

Provost. 1986. Science [Wash. DC]. 232:1145-1147; Harley, J. B., A. S. Sestak, L. G. Willis, S. M. Fu, J. A. Hansen, and M. Reichlin. 1989. Arthritis Rheum. 32:826-836; Hamilton, R. G., J. B. Harley, W. B. Bias, M. Roebber, M. Reichlin, M. C. Hochberg, and F. C. Arnett. 1988. Arthritis Rheum. 31:496-505). To test a gene complementation mechanism for these results, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the DQ alpha and DQ beta genes have been related to Ro/SSA precipitins in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. In this study Ro/SSA precipitins are related to the simultaneous presence of a particular pair of RFLPs. A DQ alpha RFLP associated with HLA-DQ1 and a DQ beta RFLP associated with HLA-DQ2 predict that the alpha beta heterodimer in HLA-DQ1/DQ2 heteroxygotes is most closely related to anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies, thereby supporting a gene complementation mechanism. Beyond this effect, an RFLP associated with HLA-DQ2 and/or DR7 is also related to Ro/SSA precipitins. Multiple molecular histocompatibility mechanisms are implicated, therefore, in the production of anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies in autoimmune disease. For anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies in SLE, and perhaps more generally, these data show that the histocompatibility antigens are among the elements that confer autoimmune response specificity and restrict the production of particular autoantibodies among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

With 0.20 mg/kg, the template bleeding time prolonged from 6.3 +/- 1.9 (mean +/- SD) to greater than 30 min; it subsequently decreased to 13 +/- 7.8 min after 12 h and to 8.3 +/- 1.5 min after 24 h. The number of unblocked GPIIb/IIIa receptors (preinfusion value, 32,000 +/- 3,000 per platelet) decreased to 13 +/- 7% of the preinfusion value 1 h after infusion, and then increased to 33 +/- 10% at 12 h, 44 +/- 8% at 24 h and 67 +/- 7% at 72 h. The logarithm of the bleeding time was inversely proportional with the residual GPIIb/IIIa receptors (r = 0.73, P less than 0.0001). ADP-induced platelet aggregation (measured by changes in light transmittance in percent) decreased from 60 +/- 5% before infusion to 1.5 +/- 3% 1 h after infusion; it then increased to 29 +/- 3% after 24 h and 39 +/- 6% after 72 h. Platelet counts decreased by 16% at 1 h and returned to control values within 24 h. Proportionally smaller effects were seen at lower doses of 7E3-F(ab')2. Antibody injection did not induce spontaneous bleeding. Angina was not observed during the first 12 h when the bleeding time was significantly prolonged, but occurred in 6 of the 16 patients within the next 3 d. 2 of the 16 patients developed low titers of IgG antibodies specific for 7E3-F(ab')2. Thus 7E3-F(ab')2 induces dose-related inhibition of platelet function; at a dose of 0.20 mg/kg, it causes profound inhibition of platelet aggregation and prolongation of the bleeding time, but no spontaneous bleeding.\r"

In hypoxic as well as in normal states, the endothelial cell layer may play a key role in controlling smooth muscle tone by secreting a number of vasoactive agents. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), produced by endothelial cells, is a major growth factor for vascular smooth muscle cells and a powerful vasoconstrictor. It consists of a disulfide-linked dimer of two related peptides, A and B, that are products of two different genes. We found that hypoxic conditions (0-3% oxygen environments) significantly increased PDGF-B mRNA in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells by enhancing the transcriptional rate of this gene. This increase was inversely proportional to oxygen tension and was reversible upon reexposure of cells to a 21% oxygen atmosphere. mRNA levels of PDGF-A were not affected nor was the overall rate of cellular gene transcription increased in response to hypoxia. These studies indicate that endothelial cells are not only capable of sensing oxygen tension, but are also able to discriminate and respond to even small differences in oxygen tension resulting in dramatic upregulation of the PDGF-B chain gene.\r"

The patient expressed only paternal phenotypes for proteins encoded by the MHC (HLA and GLO), yet was 46XX with no detectable 6p deletion. Genomic DNA from patient, parents, and sibling was digested with restriction enzymes, and blots were probed for five chromosome 6 markers. At all loci, maternal and paternal RFLPs could be distinguished, and the patient showed only paternal bands. RFLP analysis of markers from four other chromosomes showed maternal and paternal contribution. The data are consistent with uniparental isodisomy 6 (inheritance of two identical chromosome 6 haplotypes from the father and none from the mother). Direct analysis of genetic material from both parents, as well as detection of multiple protein polymorphisms encoded on chromosome 6, clearly demonstrates this novel mechanism for the expression of a recessive genetic condition.\r"

The present study was set up to observe the evolution of the LAR under IT and after having stopped IT. Nineteen children with bronchial asthma and an LAR to house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) (HDM) were selected for this study. All subjects received IT with HDM extract during 1 year. Thereafter, the children were divided randomly into two groups to receive, double-blind, during a second year, IT with HDM (N = 9) or placebo injections (N = 10). Bronchial challenges were performed after the first and second year. After the first year, a significant decrease in the severity of the LAR was noted in all but one subject (mean decrease of FEV1 before, 40.53% versus after 1 year, 22.95%; p less than 0.0001). After the second year, the severity of the LAR remained the same in the group that received HDM injections during the second year (20.78% versus 23.00%), but in the group that received placebo injections during 1 year, a significant worsening of the LAR was observed after the second year (24.90% versus 31.20%; p = 0.038). From this study it can be concluded that the severity of the LAR decreases after the first year of IT but that the severity of the LAR remains the same after the second year of IT. In children who stop receiving IT after 1 year, we observed a recurrence of the LAR after 1 year to the same level as before IT was started.\r"

During routine skin testing, in our clinic, intradermal injection of codeine (1 mg/ml) and histamine (0.02 mg/ml) are used as positive controls. We had noted that responses to codeine but not histamine are decreased in some patients with asthma who had been receiving prolonged corticosteroid therapy. Therefore, we retrospectively compared skin test responses to codeine and histamine between 25 adult subjects with asthma receiving steroids (group I) and 25 age-matched control subjects (group II). In group I, the mean wheal diameters, induced by codeine but not histamine, were significantly less than diameters in group II. This decreased skin test reactivity to codeine was not due to effects of theophylline also taken by group I subjects, since the skin test reactions of other subjects with asthma, treated with theophylline but not steroids (group III), were not significantly different from reactions in group II. We conclude that prolonged courses of corticosteroids do not appear to alter histamine-induced vascular reactivity in skin but may affect cutaneous mast cell responses by an undefined mechanism.\r"

For example, there is a 90% association between IgE production to the short ragweed allergen, Amb a V, and an HLA class II allele. To assess whether these HLA linkages are specific for ragweed, we have investigated the association between HLA antigens and the capacity of individuals to mount a specific IgE response to melittin in patients with bee-venom allergy. Twenty-two subjects with bee-venom sensitivity, 22 healthy beekeepers without bee-venom allergy, and a normal population of 149 unselected individuals were studied. With serologic tissue typing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, we have demonstrated a significant decrease in the HLA-DR4 and DQw3 alleles in subjects who are allergic to melittin compared to the control populations. There was also a negative association between the presence of HLA-DR4 and DQw3 alleles with the capacity of the individuals to mount an IgE response to phospholipase A2 (PLA2). The bee-venom sensitive subjects had a slightly lower titer of anti-PLA2 IgG when these subjects were compared to the bee-venom insensitive beekeepers. These results support the view that either HLA-DR or HLA-DQ has a protective role in controlling the IgE immune response. Lack of an IgE response to melittin or PLA2 is unlikely to be due to a failure to recognize allergen.\r"

In the present study, the effects of azelastine on neuroeffector transmission in the airway smooth muscles with double sucrose gap and isometric tension-recording methods were evaluated. Azelastine (10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/L) markedly decreased the contractile response of human bronchial and dog tracheal muscle strips to electrical field stimulation (10 pulses at 20 V, 20 Hz, 800 microseconds) in a dose-dependent manner. In parallel with actions on twitch contractions, azelastine suppressed the amplitude of excitatory junction potentials of dog trachea without changing the resting membrane potential and input resistance of smooth muscle cells. However, azelastine did not alter acetylcholine sensitivity of the smooth muscle cells. These results indicate that azelastine possesses an inhibitory action on the release of acetylcholine by vagal nerve terminals. This inhibitory effect of azelastine may contribute to the treatment of asthma in addition to its antiallergic actions.\r"

Specific IgE antibodies to the extracts were demonstrated by RAST. RAST inhibition demonstrated immunologic cross-reactivity between the life stages of T. molitor and also between T. molitor and A. diaperinus, as well as slight cross-reactivity with blowfly. The proteins in the extracts of each life stage were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. More than 15 protein bands were detected in each of the extracts, although the patterns of separation were different for each life stage. After immunoblotting and autoradiography, six different IgE-binding proteins were identified in the larval extract, five in the pupal extract, and seven in the adult extract, with similar IgE-binding patterns noted for the larval and adult extracts. We conclude that this patient developed IgE-mediated sensitivity to T. molitor antigens as the result of occupational exposure.

A 22-year-old florist experienced symptoms of rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma on exposure to baby's breath.

Prick skin tests with a 1:10(-5) wt/vol concentration of the extract produced an immediate response, whereas nonexposed atopic and normal control subjects did not react. The patient's asthmatic response to baby's breath was confirmed by bronchial challenge that caused an immediate fall in FEV1 of 26.2% from baseline after inhalation of 88 breath units of the extract. With a direct RAST, the patient's serum bound 38 times the amount of IgE bound by the negative control. IgE binding in the RAST was inhibited by the baby's breath extract but not by unrelated inhibitors (ragweed and tree pollens). Immunoblotting demonstrated IgE binding to 13 protein bands in the extract with molecular weights ranging from 11.5 to 68 kd. Serum from a patient previously reported to have sensitivity to baby's breath recognized five protein bands. Three proteins with molecular weights of 27, 31, and 37 kd were recognized by both patients' sera. We conclude that this patient developed IgE-mediated sensitivity to multiple allergens in baby's breath. This study confirms the importance of this plant as a potential cause of occupational asthma in the floral industry.\r"

These levels increased to 1816 (SEM, 606.1) pg/mg of creatinine (p = 0.041) and 174.80 (SEM, 40.1) pg/mg of creatinine (p = 0.025), respectively, after the EAR. The degree of maximal bronchoconstriction during the EAR correlated with the levels of LTE4 (r = 0.68; p = 0.001). No significant increase in urinary LTE4 levels occurred during the LAR. These results suggest that the LTE4 precursors, LTC4 and LTD4, are important bronchoconstrictor mediators causing EARs after allergen inhalation.\r"

This species was consistently found in concentrations of 10(8) bacteria per milliliter of metal-working fluid during 1 year of observation. No increased frequency of respiratory infections or discomfort was related to the exposure to the infected fluid. The antibody response to the bacterium consisted predominantly of IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies. IgG2 antibodies dominated the antibody response to the lipopolysaccharide of the bacterium. IgA1 and IgA2 antibodies were also found. Smokers had significantly reduced antibody levels of all subclasses compared with nonsmokers. The antibody levels in smokers did not differ from levels of the unexposed control group. Analyses of the total serum immunoglobulin concentrations with respect to subclasses revealed that the total IgG2 levels were also significantly reduced in smokers. In nonsmokers, the age of the individuals influenced the antibody levels of the IgG1, IgG2, IgA1, and IgA2 subclasses, the levels decreasing with increasing age. For smokers, the correlation between age and antibody levels was only obvious for IgG2 antibodies. Decreased IgG2 antibody levels in the smokers were also accompanied by decreased FEV1 values (p less than 0.01). Subclass analysis of the antibody response to P. pseudoalcaligenes demonstrated that the subclass pattern for the whole bacterium differed from the pattern of the major cell wall component, the lipopolysaccharide. The significance of qualitative and quantitative differences in the subclass antibody response is discussed.\r"

Ninety-six around-the-clock saliva theophylline profiles were performed in 59 children (median age, 8.3 years) under routine life conditions. Five to seven stimulated saliva samples were collected by parents at home during a 24-hour period. Highest (Cmax) and lowest (Cmin) saliva theophylline concentrations (Sal-TC) were not consistently found after or before medication, respectively. Cmax occurred during morning hours (before or after medication) in 82% of patients. Cmax was found immediately before morning or evening dose in as many as 25% of patients. Cmin occurred in 70% of children during evening hours. Cmin was found 4 hours after morning or evening dose in 19% of patients. Excessive fluctuation in Sal-TC between pre- and post-SRT doses during both day and night hours occurred in six patients (286% +/- 87% (mean +/- SD)). Marked circadian variation in Sal-TC was disclosed in 23% of children. The first profile performed was therapeutically satisfactory in only 39% of patients; satisfactory profiles were achieved in other children after changing daily SRT dose or dosing interval. Determination of theophylline concentration in stimulated saliva specimens obtained frequently during a 24-hour period and under routine life conditions is practical and extremely valuable for close monitoring and individualization of theophylline therapy in ambulatory children with asthma.\r"

Twenty subjects, 4 1/2 to 14 1/2 years of age, were each tested after both the administration of albuterol aerosol and a placebo. The fine-motor composite of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency was used to evaluate abilities in response speed, visual-motor control, and speed and dexterity. The degree of tremor was tested with a \"steadiness\" tester, and postural adjustment was recorded on a clinical rating scale. No significant differences were found in fine-motor skills after albuterol or placebo administration, but a significant increase in tremor as well as in postural adjustment occurred after albuterol. The effect of test order and several other patient characteristics on test scores may be related to these findings. Major educational adjustments to compensate for the increase in tremor are unnecessary.\r"

It is manifested by a decrease in efficacy and a waning of the inhibition of skin reactivity to allergen or histamine. Subsensitivity to loratadine was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study in 20 allergic subjects (22 to 35 years) who received either placebo or loratadine (10 mg one daily) for 12 weeks. Skin prick tests were done with six threefold increasing concentrations of standardized allergen extracts (orchard grass or mite) and histamine-coated Phazet. Skin tests were done before any treatment and after 7, 28, 56, and 84 days. Wheals and flares were measured. Compliance was monitored strictly during the study. Statistical analysis was done by parallel line bioassay and Wilcoxon W test. Skin test reactivity to histamine or allergen did not change throughout the trial in the placebo-treated group. Patients treated by loratadine had a significantly smaller wheal-and-flare reaction after 7 days. This effect was greater at 28 days and lasted throughout the treatment period. This study demonstrates that subsensitivity to loratadine measured by histamine and allergen skin tests does not develop during a 12-week period.\r"

However, the percentages of positive RAST for hen's egg or cow's milk in the patients with AD were lower than percentages in the patients with immediate symptoms. In the patients with AD, there were no significant correlations between the proliferative responses of PBMCs and the RAST values. There were no significant differences of RAST scores among groups of patients having different degrees of severity of AD. The proliferative responses of PBMCs to ovalbumin or bovine serum albumin in patients with severe AD or moderate AD who were sensitive to hen's egg or cow's milk tended to be higher than responses of patients with mild AD, respectively, but there were no significant differences in those results. Taken together, the combination of RAST and the detection of proliferative responses of PBMCs to each food antigen is very useful in the diagnosis of hypersensitivity in children with AD who are sensitive to food allergens.\r"

  ".W": "Although some studies have clearly demonstrated tachyphylaxis to inhaled histamine in subjects with asthma, other studies have not. We speculated that histamine tachyphylaxis might be related to the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) to histamine. We undertook three successive bronchial histamine challenges in two groups of 10 subjects with asthma chosen on the basis of their baseline BHR. In the group with mild asthma, the baseline provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was greater than 2.5 mg/ml, and in the group with severe asthma, the baseline PC20 histamine was less than 1 mg/ml. The second and third histamine challenges in each subject were performed when FEV1 values had recovered to within 5% of the baseline FEV1 before the first challenge. There was no significant shift in reactivity to histamine from the first to the third challenge in either group. The geometric mean PC20 (+/- geometric SE) for the group with mild asthma was 4.27 (3.86 to 4.72) mg/ml for the first challenge and 5.42 (4.47 to 6.57) mg/ml for the third challenge. There was a mean increase of 0.34 doubling dilutions in PC20 for the group with mild asthma from the first to the third challenge, although this did not reach statistical significance. For the group with severe asthma, the geometric mean PC20 was 0.48 (0.39 to 0.59) mg/ml for the first challenge and 0.47 (0.38 to 0.59) mg/ml for the third challenge. There was no trend in this group toward any increase in PC20.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of T cells by superantigens has been reported to be dependent on the presence of APC where binding to class II molecules is a prerequisite to recognition by the TCR. We examined the response of human T cells and a leukemic T cell line, Jurkat to the superantigen, streptococcal M protein. We show that immobilized or cross-linked streptococcal M protein stimulates Jurkat cells (V beta 8), but not normal purified human T cells, to produce IL-2. Activation of purified T cells by this superantigen required costimulatory signals provided by PMA, IL-1, and IL-6. These cytokines and growth factors alone can induce IL-2 production by T cells; however, proliferation occurred only in the presence of superantigen, which together with PMA, IL-1, and IL-6 induced the expression of IL-2R alpha on T cells. Similar results were obtained when the response of purified T cells to another known superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B were examined, indicating that this phenomenon is not unique to M protein. Superantigens interact with a large number of T cells with particular V beta, and thus provide excellent models for studies of the role of biochemical events and signal transduction in T cell activation. Understanding these events may also explain the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases associated with certain superantigens, such as streptococcal M protein that is thought to be involved in rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.\r"

  ".U": "90347181\r", 
  ".W": "IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine which is produced by a variety of cells. Therefore it was examined whether anti-CD3-induced T cell activation was associated with the induction of functionally relevant IL-6 in human monocyte accessory cells. Significantly increased amounts of IL-6 were detected in supernatants of anti-CD3-treated PBMC. Stimulation of FACS-sorted greater than 98% pure monocyte accessory cells, but not of highly purified T cells with anti-CD3, resulted in an increased IL-6 production. Furthermore, anti-CD3 significantly enhanced IL-6 mRNA expression in monocyte accessory cells. IL-6 production was not limited to anti-CD3, inasmuch as equivalent IL-6 stimulation could be achieved with a mouse IgG2a isotype control antibody. In contrast to solid phase-bound mouse IgG2a, the soluble form of this antibody failed to induce IL-6 secretion indicating a requirement for Fc gamma RI receptor cross-linking. Moreover, this property may be specific for the Fc gamma RI receptor inasmuch as mouse IgG1 antibodies binding to the Fc gamma RII receptor did not significantly enhance IL-6 production. The role of IL-6 being an additional signal in T cell activation was confirmed by the finding that an anti-IL-6 antiserum was able to suppress anti-CD3-induced T cell activation. These data indicate that binding of anti-CD3 to Fc gamma RI may generate an activation signal towards the monocyte accessory cell leading to the production and secretion of monocyte IL-6, which in turn augments T cell activation, and also may be relevant to a variety of antibody-mediated immune responses against viral and bacterial infections.\r"

A total of 10 to 20% of antibodies specific for H-2E molecules were gradually internalized with a t 1/2 of 15 min, reaching a plateau after 30 min at 37 degrees C. Equivalent results were obtained either with the whole antibody or Fab' fragments, suggesting that the internalization of class II molecules was spontaneous. Similar results were obtained with antibodies specific for the transferrin receptor, of which 50% were internalized with t 1/2 of 5 min, reaching a plateau after 30 min. In contrast to antibodies specific for H-2E molecules and the transferrin receptor, antibodies specific for H-2K were not internalized. Reappearance of internalized H-2E-specific antibodies at the cell surface was observed at 37 degrees C. When compared to antibodies specific for surface Ig, degradation of antibodies specific for H-2E molecules was limited even after 5 h incubation. Neither ammonium chloride nor cycloheximide inhibited internalization and recycling. Electron microscopy showed that internalization of H-2E molecules occurred via coated pits/coated vesicles. These results indicate that class II molecules are spontaneously internalized and recycled by B lymphocytes.\r"

IEL, although not splenic or lymph node lymphocytes, from athymic chimeras displayed normal levels of cells bearing the class-specific T cell Ag, CD4 and CD8; the TCR-associated molecule, CD3; and the Thy-1 Ag. Moreover, two-color flow cytometric analyses of IEL from athymic mice demonstrated regulated expression of T cell Ag characteristic of IEL subset populations from thymus-bearing mice. In immunoprecipitation experiments, surface TCR-alpha beta or TCR-gamma delta were expressed on IEL, although not on splenic lymphocytes, from athymic chimeras. That IEL from athymic chimeras constituted a population of functionally mature effector cells activated in situ, similar to IEL from thymus-bearing mice, was demonstrated by the presence of CD3-mediated lytic activity of athymic lethally irradiated bone marrow reconstituted IEL. These data provide compelling evidence that intestinal T cells do not require thymic influence for maturation and development, and demonstrate that the microenvironment of the intestinal epithelium is uniquely adapted to regulate IEL differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that streptococcal preparation (OK-432), which is a TNF inducer, inhibits insulitis and development of autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and Bio-Breeding (BB) rats, as animal models of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We have recently shown that recombinant human (h)TNF-alpha also suppresses development of diabetes in NOD mice. In this study we have extended our observation on TNF to BB rats in order to see whether TNF generally inhibits autoimmune diabetes. A total of 5 x 10(4) U of rhTNF-alpha was administered i.p., twice a week to male and female BB rats from 4 to 27 wk of age. The cumulative incidence of diabetes by 27 wk of age in nontreated rats was 36.4% (8/22), whereas that in hTNF-alpha-treated rats was 0% (0/21) (p less than 0.001). The hTNF-alpha-treated rats did not lose body weight and maintained normal blood glucose concentrations. Immunologic and histologic examinations were performed at the end of the experiment. Spleen cell cytotoxicities for NK-sensitive YAC-1 and rat insulinoma (RINm5F) cells in hTNF-alpha-treated rats significantly decreased in comparison with nontreated and nondiabetic BB rats. Intensity of insulitis was also inhibited in hTNF-alpha-treated rats. Interestingly, a huge hepatomegaly and splenomegaly was found in two of the 21 hTNF-alpha-treated rats. The latter consisted of W3/13dull+ and W3/25dull+ cells, which did not exhibit cytotoxicity for either YAC-1 or RINm5F cells. These results indicate that the chronic and systemic administration of TNF has a regulatory role in autoimmune diabetes in BB rats as well as in NOD mice, and that these animals may have a defect in TNF-mediated immunoregulation.\r"

Using these transformants, we tested a panel of cytokines for the ability to mimic CD40 mAb. rIL-6 behaved like CD40 mAb and inhibited the growth of M12/CD40+ cells but not of CD40/tailless or CD40/234A mutants. The effect of IL-6 on M12/CD40+ cells not only required intact CD40 including threonine 234 but also was specific because IL-6 mAb blocked the inhibitory activity. The M12/CD40+ cells responsive to IL-6 expressed greater than 300,000 CD40 molecules/cells but, like M12/CD40-controls, expressed only small numbers (less than 50/cell) of high affinity IL-6R, indicating that CD40 is not a receptor for IL-6. Nevertheless, IL-6 utilizes intact CD40 efficiently when it signals these cells: treatment of M12/CD40+ cells with IL-6 induced increased phosphorylation of CD40. Conversely, triggering CD40 on M12/CD40+ cells leads to IL-6 production. Similar effects were evident in human CD40+ B cells: IL-6 increased the phosphorylation of CD40 in the IL-6-responsive cell line, CESS, and CD40 mAb induced IL-6 production in activated human B cells. Thus, CD40 may function to receive and regulate IL-6-dependent signals in B cells.\r"

  ".W": "We describe the production and characterization of three mAb to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and the use of two of them for the development of a TGF-beta 1-specific ELISA and for the study of the regulation of immune function in vitro. All three mAb bound recombinant human TGF-beta 1 (rHuTGF-beta 1) with high affinity and recognized the dimer form of this molecule in immunoblots. mAb 2G7 immunoprecipitated rHuTGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, and rHuTGF-beta 3 and neutralized the growth inhibitory activity of all three molecules in vitro on mink lung epithelial-like cells, Mv1Lu, indicating a shared neutralization epitope. mAb 4A11 neutralized and immunoprecipitated only rHuTGF-beta 1, and mAb 12H5 immunoprecipitated rHuTGF-beta 1 but had no effect on the bioactivity of either rHuTGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, or rHuTGF-beta 3. These results suggest that a second neutralization epitope may be unique to TGF-beta 1. The ELISA was developed with mAb 4A11 and 12H5, with a range of 0.63 to 40 ng/ml, i.e., a sensitivity of 0.63 ng/ml or 63 pg/sample. The assay is accurate, precise, and specific for the active but not the inactive or latent TGF-beta 1 complex and fails to react with TGF-beta 2, rHuTGF-beta 3, inhibin A, and activin A. Supernatants obtained from serum-free cultures of human PBMC from multiple donors contained significant quantities of TGF-beta 1 (3 to 15 ng/ml), which was detected in the ELISA only after pH 2 treatment to convert latent TGF-beta to the active form. Treatment of the PBMC with either recombinant human IL-2 (rHuIL-2) or PHA-P/PMA enhanced the production of latent TGF-beta 1. mAb 4A11 and 2G7, but not mAb 12H5 enhanced both the proliferative response of PBMC to rHuIL-2/rHuTNF-alpha and PHA-P and the development of the rHuIL-2/rHuTNF-alpha treated PBMC into LAK cells with cytotoxic activity against COLO target cells. These findings suggest that although PBMC secrete latent TGF-beta 1, mechanisms that convert the latent TGF-beta complex into an active form exist in vitro and that the endogenously produced TGF-beta can regulate immune functions in an autocrine fashion.\r"

In our study we have determined that UK-14304 (UK) and norepinephrine (NE), both alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, can augment LPS-stimulated TNF from elicited macrophages (MO). The increase in TNF production was concentration dependent with an EC50 for UK and NE of 8.1 +/- 2.6 and 0.52 +/- 0.17 nM, respectively. The concentration-effect curve for UK and NE was shifted to the right by the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine (10(-6) M), with new EC50 of 49.7 +/- 12.2 (p less than 0.001) nM and 10.3 +/- 22 nM. The augmenting effect of UK on MO TNF production was assessed over a 7 log LPS response curve. Within a single population of MO 10 nM UK shifted the LPS-induced TNF curve eightfold to the left with the greatest increase in TNF production at lower LPS concentrations. At the transcriptional level, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that UK increased LPS-induced TNF mRNA accumulation. This augmentation in TNF mRNA accumulation was blocked by yohimbine. The presence of a MO alpha-adrenergic receptor was established by demonstrating binding of the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist 3H-yohimbine to membranes prepared from MO. This binding was rapid, saturable, reversible, and blocked by UK, clonidine, and phentolamine. These investigations support the role of alpha 2 adrenergic agonists as immunostaining compounds that may regulate cytokine production during an inflammatory response.\r"

  ".U": "90347197\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously produced mAb against angiotensin II (AII), a phylogenetically conserved vasopressive octapeptide, and shown that they identify four distinct epitopes on the AII molecule. In addition we used internal image bearing polyclonal antiidiotypic antibodies raised against rabbit anti AII to produce mAb3. In this study we analyze the segregation of the idiotypic and paratopic repertoires of the mAb1 and mAb3. Analysis of mAb1 carried out with polyclonal Ab2 raised against the four distinct paratopes permitted classification of the mAb1 into four categories: (p+, id+) comprises antibodies with shared paratopic and idiotypic specificities: (p+, id-) is made up of antibodies that fail to express the Id defined by Ab2 raised against other antibodies pertaining to the same paratopic group; (p-, id+) includes antibodies that express cross-reactive Id on distinct paratopes; (p-, id-) refers to antibodies unrelated by their paratopes and Id mAb2 confirmed these results and showed expression of identical or closely related Id on clearly distinct paratopes. At the Ab3 level, using polyclonal Ab4, there was a higher degree of Id cross-reactivity between the two paratopes available. These data suggest that the parallel set concept may apply to the immune response to a natural peptidic Ag and its internal image. Comparison of idiotypic repertoires of mAb1 and mAb3 (using Ab2 and Ab4 antibodies) confirmed the lack of public Id and showed the predominance on mAb3 of \"new\" idiotypes absent from mAb1 molecules, as expected for internal image-induced antibodies. Cross-reactive idiotypes defined on mAb1 and conserved on mAb3 were expressed on the two paratopes defined at the Ab3 level. They were located on the H chain of the homologous paratope and required the association of H and L chains on the heterologous paratope. Our analysis suggests that, in the AII system, the idiotypic and paratopic repertoires segregate at least in part independently. The paratopic repertoire is limited to a small number of phylogenetically conserved specificities and may be encoded by germline genes. In contrast, the idiotypic repertoire is broader with respect to specificities, species, and localization on H and L chains. This extended diversity may be generated by somatic mutations or use of various combinations of H and L chains and/or V, D, J segments.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular nature of the structural changes on the T cell-CD6 glycoprotein upon cell activation has been investigated. Cell surface 125I labeling and immunoprecipitation studies from PBMC revealed that after stimulation by different activators of protein kinase C, or after exposure to either human or FCS, the anti-CD6 mAb precipitated an additional protein of 130 kDa, together with the 105-kDa protein present in resting cells. Cell surface expression of this 130-kDa CD6 protein form could be detected as early as 15 min after PKC activation, without requiring de novo protein synthesis. Pulse and chase activation experiments of radioiodinated cells suggested that the 130-kDa molecule is the result of a posttranslational modification of the 105-kDa protein and that this conversion is a reversible process. Studies of 32P-cell labeling and immunoprecipitation by anti-CD6 mAb revealed that only the 130-kDa form was phosphorylated, whereas the 105-kDa protein was unphosphorylated both in resting and activated cells. Moreover, the removal of phosphate groups from the 130-kDa CD6-form by enzymatic treatment with alkaline phosphatase resulted in its conversion to the 105-kDa form. Taken together, these results demonstrate the existence of two CD6 molecular forms that are in a dynamic equilibrium and differ only at their degree of phosphorylation: a 105-kDa unphosphorylated form present in resting T cells that changes very rapidly to a 130-kDa phosphorylated form by exposure of cells either to serum or to activators of PKC.\r"

  ".U": "90347199\r", 
  ".W": "We have analyzed the functional significance of the four amino acid differences between the parental H-2Kb and mutant H-2Kbm8 glycoproteins. Six bm8 variants including single substitutions at residues 22, 23, 24, and 30 as well as paired substitutions at residues 23, 30 and 22, 24 were generated and transfected into L cells. Surface expression of these H-2Kb variants was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies which bind to well-defined H-2Kb epitopes. No alterations introduced into the conformational structure of H-2Kb by the amino acid substitutions were detected. The effect of these substitutions on CTL recognition was initially analyzed using the following bulk CTL: either H-2Kb anti-H-2Kbm8, H-2Kbm8 anti-H-2Kb, or third party anti-H-2Kb. The alloreactivity between H-2Kb and H-2Kbm8 is dominated by the amino acid substitution at residue 24 (Glu----Ser). The complete bm8 phenotype, however, also requires the additional substitution at residue 22 (Tyr----Phe). The H-2Kbm8 anti-Kb bulk CTL reacted with both variant H-2Kbm8 molecules containing single substitutions at amino acid positions 22 or 24 but not the variant molecule containing both substitutions. Further analysis using three individual H-2Kbm8 anti-Kb CTL clones indicated the complexity of the self Kbm8 phenotype. Clone 8B1.20 did not react to changes in residues 22 or 24. The 8B1.32 clone reacted with the change at residue 22 but not with the change at residue 24, although the 8B1.54 clone reacted with the change at residue 24 but not with the change at residue 22. The changes in residues 23 (Met----Ile) and/or 30 (Asp----Asn) did not impact significantly on the alloantigenic properties of Kbm8 as determined by both the bulk and cloned CTL populations. According to the three-dimensional class I structure the substitution at amino acid 24 is inaccessible to the TCR. The location of this substitution within the Ag recognition site implies that altered peptide binding, and not a disruption of MHC residues that interact with the TCR, is responsible for the alloreactivity between H-2Kb and H-2Kbm8.\r"

  ".W": "Protein tyrosine kinases play fundamental roles in the transduction of signals that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and functional responses to a diversity of external stimuli. It is therefore likely that understanding protein tyrosine kinase activity in NK cells will be crucial in further defining the intracellular regulation of their unique and specialized functions. We investigated the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in receptor-mediated signal transduction using stimuli known to play major roles in regulating NK cell activation. Immunoblot analyses with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies demonstrated that IL-2, a potent stimulus for NK cell proliferation and an agent that enhances NK cytotoxic function, induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of at least eight proteins in clonal CD16+/CD3-human NK cells. In contrast, IL-4, which modulates NK cell function without inducing proliferation, had no apparent effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Because protein kinase C (PKC) activation plays a prominent, yet distinct role in NK cell-mediated cytolytic reactions, we next investigated whether PKC activation affects NK cell protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Surprisingly, PKC-activating agents, including the phorbol esters 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and 4 beta-phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate, as well as the synthetic diacylglycerol,1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a distinct set of proteins. The 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate homolog, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, which does not activate PKC, also failed to induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Further, the PKC inhibitor, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methylglycerol blocked tyrosine phosphorylation induced by 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol. In subsequent studies, both CD8+ and CD8- NK clones were found to express the src-family tyrosine kinase, p56lck, which was detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-p56lck antiserum. In both types of clonal NK cell lines, IL-2 and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol appeared to stimulate the differential phosphorylation of p56lck as evidenced by the appearance of higher molecular mass isoforms on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Thus, our results identify and characterize a potential role for tyrosine phosphorylation and for the lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase p56lck in the signaling events that regulate NK cell activation.\r"

We used homogeneous, cloned populations of CD16+/CD3- human NK cells to characterize and compare the transmembrane signaling mechanisms used during these alternative forms of cytotoxicity. Cross-linkage of NK cell FcR with anti-FcR (anti-CD16) mAb or direct binding to NK-sensitive tumor targets resulted in a rapid release of inositol phosphates and increases in [Ca2+]i. The receptor-dependent [Ca2+]i increase (as monitored in indo-1 loaded NK cells by flow cytometry) consisted of an initial release of calcium from intracellular stores, followed by a sustained influx of calcium across the plasma membrane. To assess the potential regulatory feedback role of protein kinase C (PKC) activation in these proximal signaling events, NK cells were pretreated with either PKC-activating phorbol esters, nonactivating phorbol ester homologs, or synthetic diacylglycerols. Brief pretreatment with activating phorbol esters rapidly inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, both phosphoinositide hydrolysis and increases in [Ca2+]i induced by FcR ligation, whereas pretreatment with an inactive phorbol ester had no effect. This acute inhibitory effect was not explained by FcR down-regulation, which occurred with more prolonged exposure to phorbol esters. In contrast, the phosphoinositide turnover and [Ca2+]i increase in NK cells stimulated with NK-sensitive tumor targets were not affected by prior exposure to PKC-activating phorbol esters. This differential regulatory effect of phorbol ester on proximal signaling was paralleled by a corresponding effect on cytotoxicity, i.e., phorbol ester-induced activation of PKC inhibited FcR-dependent cytotoxicity, but did not alter direct cytotoxicity against NK-sensitive tumor cells. These results indicate that PKC activation can differentially regulate alternative forms of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by rapidly and specifically desensitizing the FcR.\r"

Clinical trials are currently in progress with AS101 on AIDS and cancer patients. We found that AS101 was capable of inducing spleen cells and peritoneal exudate cells to secrete high quantities of CSF and IL-1. Because IL-1 has been previously described as a radioprotector and CSF may induce in vivo the proliferation of hemopoietic cells, we designed the present study in order to evaluate the effects of prolonged in vivo injections of AS101 on protection against lethal doses of irradiation, on the recovery pattern of precursor cells, and on the functioning of bone marrow (BM) and spleen cells of mice undergoing sublethal doses of treatment. We demonstrate that pretreatment with AS101 protects mice from lethal effects of ionizing radiation. AS101 was also found to significantly increase the number of BM and spleen cells, the absolute number of granulocyte macrophage-CFU and the secretion of CSF by BM cells. All were tested 9 days after sublethal dose of irradiation was administered. AS101 was found to have all of these radioprotective effects only when administered to mice before irradiation treatment. Moreover, the compound was found to enhance the proportion of CFU-S that enters the S phase of the cell cycle. These findings indicate that AS101 may be a promising agent to be used in reducing the time needed for reconstitution of hemopoietic cells after irradiation treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Invasion of tissue by monocytes in the course of cellular immune reactions is a multistep process that is thought to be based on the action of urokinase type plasminogen activator (u-PA), an ubiquitous serine protease able to convert the zymogen plasminogen into the active protease plasmin. Expression and occupation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptors (u-PA-R) are known to be up-regulated by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, and endogenously occupied u-PA-R were found to be instrumental in monocyte invasiveness. We used the amnion invasion assay to investigate whether monocyte invasiveness is affected by matrix-bound plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI) and by fluid phase u-PA. We show in this study that preincubation of amnion membranes with 1.5 U/cm2 PAI-1 decreases invasion of IFN-gamma activated monocytes by 70% compared with controls. Anti-vitronectin antibodies, which block PAI-1 binding to the matrix, abrogate the inhibitory effect of PAI-1 on monocyte invasiveness, indicating that active PAI-1 is bound via matrix-associated vitronectin. In contrast, preincubation of the amnion membrane with PAI-2 which does not bind to the extracellular matrix has no effect on monocyte invasiveness. Finally, the inhibitory action of matrix-bound PAI-1 can be abrogated by addition of 5 IU/ml u-PA to the monocytes in the invasion chamber. These findings indicate that monocyte invasiveness might be regulated not only by expression and occupation of u-PA-R but also by matrix-bound PAI-1.\r"

  ".U": "90347209\r", 
  ".W": "Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid modulation has been used as an anti-inflammatory strategy in experimental models of disease as well as in clinical trials. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of manipulating dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, the in vivo effects of essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency and (n-3) fatty acid supplementation were contrasted using a model of acute inflammation induced by the i.p. injection of zymosan into mice. Both diets led to a substantial decrease in tissue (n-6) fatty acid content. EFA deficiency was also characterized by the accumulation of (n-9) fatty acids, particularly 20:3 (n-9), the fatty acid that uniquely characterizes the deficiency state. Dietary (n-3) fatty acid supplementation led instead to marked increases in (n-3) fatty acids, especially 20:5 (n-3). With respect to the antiinflammatory effects of the two diets, EFA deficiency, but not (n-3) fatty acid supplementation, depleted levels of resident peritoneal macrophages. EFA deficiency was also more effective than (n-3) fatty acid supplementation in inhibiting the influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in response to zymosan. The effect of the two diets on the in vivo generation of leukotriene(LT)B also differed markedly. EFA deficiency completely inhibited the synthesis of LTB. Dietary (n-3) fatty acid supplementation, in contrast, reduced the production of LTB4 by only 50%. With (n-3) fatty acid supplementation LTB5 was produced. The more modest effect of (n-3) fatty acid supplementation in decreasing LTB4 generation was not due to blockade of the cyclooxygenase pathway. EFA deficiency, but not (n-3) fatty acid supplementation, was associated with the decreased synthesis of thromboxane. Although dietary fatty acid modulation has been shown to diminish platelet activating factor (PAF) synthesis, studies using the PAF receptor blocker, L659989, established that PAF was not a significant factor in the elicitation of leukocytes in this model of inflammation. In summary, the anti-inflammatory effect of EFA deficiency was more marked that that of dietary (n-3) fatty acid supplementation in acute inflammation. This difference in anti-inflammatory potential appeared to be due to either the greater effect of EFA deficiency in decreasing levels of resident peritoneal macrophages or in suppressing the in vivo generation of LTB4.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the effects of LPS and PMA on the expression of functional mannose receptors in rat bone marrow-derived macrophages. After 48 h of treatment with LPS (10 ng/ml) and PMA (100 nM), mannose receptor activity was reduced by 70 to 80%. The effect of these agents on receptor activity was not reversible, and activity continued to decline after the agents were removed. Pretreatment of cells with dexamethasone was effective in blocking the LPS/PMA-induced down-regulation. Serine protease inhibitors did not block the reduction in receptor activity, suggesting that proteolysis is not involved in receptor down-regulation. LPS/PMA treatment did not increase turnover of the receptor. Ligand uptake studies showed that the total capacity of the uptake system was reduced by 80%, although the Kuptake was unaffected. Binding of 125I-mannose-BSA to intact macrophages showed a 70% decrease in surface receptor activity after treatment with LPS/PMA. LPS/PMA treatment had no effect on total receptor synthesis as quantitated by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled receptor. However, binding of metabolically labeled receptor to mannose-Sepharose, and binding of 125I-mannose-BSA to immunoprecipitated receptor revealed that intracellular plus surface binding sites were reduced to approximately 30% after LPS/PMA treatment. These results suggest that LPS/PMA treatment of macrophages results in an inactivation of mannose receptors with no effect on receptor turnover or biosynthesis.\r"

  ".U": "90347211\r", 
  ".W": "Human rTNF-alpha (greater than or equal to U/ml) decreased PMN nondirected and directed migration to FMLP to approximately 50% of control. Adenosine (100 microM) almost completely restored hrTNF-inhibited migration (nondirected from 54 to 92% and directed migration to from 54 to 93% of control). The lowest concentration of adenosine that restored hrTNF-inhibited migration was 3 microM, and the adenosine analogue, 5'-(N-cyclopropyl)-carboxamido-adenosine (CPCA) was more potent than adenosine. Although CPCA binds to A2-receptors and stimulates adenylate cyclase, the reversal of hrTNF-inhibited chemotaxis was found to be independent of both PMN cAMP content and binding to A2-receptors, because neither 8-Br-cAMP nor pertussis adenylate cyclase restored hrTNF-inhibited PMN chemotaxis and the A2-receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-7-methylxanthine decreased CPCA stimulated cAMP but enhanced CPCA-restoration of hrTNF-inhibited chemotaxis. The effect of adenosine could be augmented by inhibition of adenosine uptake and decreased by adenosine deamination. Pentoxifylline, (3,7 dimethyl-1-[5 oxo-hexyl] xanthine), like adenosine also restored PMN chemotaxis inhibited by hrTNF. The adenosine receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8(phenyl-p-acrylate)-xanthine (BW A1433U), decreased restoration of hrTNF-inhibited chemotaxis by CPCA or pentoxifylline. Thus, the inhibitory effect of hrTNF on PMN migration can be counteracted by adenosine, CPCA, pentoxifylline, and compounds that increase adenosine availability to the surface of the PMN. Inasmuch as an A1-selective agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine was less active, and the action of the A2-selective agonist CPCA was enhanced by an A2-receptor antagonist, we hypothesize that neither A1 or A2 receptors are involved in adenosine restoration of hrTNF-inhibited chemotaxis. Further, increased cAMP, an A2-regulated event, does not cause the effect, and adenosine restoration of hrTNF-inhibited migration does not appear to be mediated by changes in PMN [F-actin], FMLP receptor expression, or cytosolic calcium. Hence, the restoration of hrTNF-inhibited chemotaxis is controlled by a novel cyclic AMP-independent action on the PMN surface.\r"

This event, assessed by 51Cr release, was accompanied by sustained depolarization of the plasma membrane potential and Ca2+ influx. Plasma membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx occurred within a few seconds of ATPo addition to both cell types, whereas 51Cr was released without apparent lag in YAC-1 cells and after 2 h in P-815 cells. Furthermore, a rise in [Ca2+]i was required for ATPo-dependent lysis of YAC-1 but not P-815 cells. In P-815 cells, ATPo caused an early and [Ca2+]i-independent DNA fragmentation that occurred at lower nucleotide concentrations than those required to trigger 51Cr release. Instead in YAC-1 cells very low concentrations of ATPo caused early lysis (ED50 for lysis about 200 microM) accompanied by only barely detectable DNA fragmentation. Previous studies disclosed that lymphokine-activated killer cells are fully resistant to the membrane-perturbing effects of ATPo. We show that lymphokine-activated killer cells also do not undergo DNA fragmentation even in the presence of high ATPo concentrations. This study complements previous observations on the lytic effects of ATPo and shows that this nucleotide can also cause DNA fragmentation, one of the earliest target cell alterations observed during CTL-mediated lysis.\r"

Ten clones producing recombinant Ag were selected and plaque purified; lysogens were produced and found to express beta-galactosidase fusion proteins ranging in molecular mass from 115 to 138 kDa. When ammonium sulfate-precipitated lysates of these recombinant phage clones were examined for their ability to stimulate PBMC from a patient with onchocerciasis, all 10 recombinants produced stimulation above that to nonrecombinant phage. When individual fusion proteins, affinity purified on anti-beta-galactosidase linked to agarose, were used to stimulate PBMC from patients with onchocerciasis, only one of the recombinant Ag induced PBMC proliferation (stimulation index greater than 4) above that to Ag from nonrecombinant phage. Characterization of the DNA coding for this Ag showed it to be 1.2 kb in length with a small (90 bp) open reading frame; furthermore, it appears to be Onchocerca specific (on genomic dot blots) and single copy. Using overlapping peptides encompassing the entire open reading frame, one T cell epitope has been localized.\r"

  ".W": "Cryptosporidiosis has become an important infection in man, particularly among very young or immunocompromised individuals. Here, the protective role of antibody responses to Cryptosporidium was examined using a well established murine model of cryptosporidiosis. Although normal neonatal BALB/c mice exhibited good IgM and IgG serum antibody responses, no correlation could be drawn between the intensity of these responses and the severity or duration of cryptosporidiosis. Moreover, B cell-deficient (anti-mu-treated) neonatal BALB/c mice did not differ from untreated or normal rabbit Ig-treated, age-matched controls in the onset, peak, or duration of cryptosporidiosis. The apparent absence of a role for antibody in these self resolving infections was supported by the lack of susceptibility of anti-mu-treated adult BALB/c to attempted infection with doses of Cryptosporidium 10 times the dose required to infect 100% of normal (Ig producing) neonates. The results suggest that the role of specific in vivo antibody responses in the resolution of murine infection with this coccidian parasite is minor and that the likelihood of success for cryptosporidial vaccines aimed solely at enhancing in vivo antibody production may be limited.\r"

Expression of the same molecule, as originally recognized by the mAb 6C3, is widely accepted to be associated with the complete malignant transformation of pre-B lymphoid cells. We have examined BP-1/6C3 expression in a panel of established Abelson virus-transformed cells that includes both cells analogous to pre-B cells and to less differentiated B lineage cells that have not yet completed Ig H chain gene rearrangement. This analysis reveals that many of the less differentiated transformants do not express BP-1/6C3 for an extended culture period. In contrast, virtually all transformants that are analogous to normal pre-B cells express the determinant early in their culture history. The BP-1/6C3 negative transformants are fully tumorigenic in syngeneic mice, demonstrating that BP-1/6C3 expression is not required for complete malignant transformation. Our data thus suggest that the pattern of BP-1/6C3 expression in Abelson virus-transformed cells mimics that observed in normal cells and is indicative of a differentiation event unrelated to the malignant potential of the cells.\r"

In an 18-h cytotoxicity assay clones with high levels of H-2Kb Ag expression were found more sensitive to lysis by spleen cells of syngenic and allogeneic mice than H-2Kb low clones. NK cells were involved in the lysis of H-2Kb+ BL6 melanoma clones, with spleen cell cytotoxicity of mice increased after poly I:C stimulation or decreased after pretreatment with anti-asialo GM1 serum or NK1.1 mAb. Anti-TNF Ab were also able to reduce the cytotoxicity of normal spleen cells and completely abolished the cytotoxicity of the NK-depleted spleen cells suggesting involvement of NC cells in lysis of H-2Kb+ BL6 melanoma clones. Increase in sensitivity of H-2Kb+ BL6 cells to natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity was associated with the appearance of NK recognizable determinants as assessed by the cold target inhibition assay. All BL6 clones, irrespective of sensitivity to natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity, showed high sensitivity to lysis by LGL-derived granules. In contrast, all H-2Kb low BL6 clones were resistant and all H-2Kb highly positive clones were sensitive to lysis by TNF-alpha. When an H-2Kb highly positive clone was selected in vitro for resistance to TNF, it concomitantly showed increased resistance to cytotoxicity by spleen cells, confirming the importance of TNF in spleen cell cytotoxicity against H-2Kb+ melanoma cells. Taken together, the data indicate that class I H-2Kb but not class II H-2IAk gene product could increase the sensitivity of BL6 cells to lysis by NK and natural cytotoxic cells as well as TNF. We hypothesize that these effects could be due to pleiotropic effects of H-2Kb gene products on various biologic properties of BL6 melanoma cells some of which may be more directly involved in regulation of tumor cell sensitivity to lysis by NK and/or natural cytotoxic cells.\r"

Zinc chelatase activity was markedly reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 14 EPP patients (mean, 3.3 nmol Zn protohaem/h/mg protein; range, 0.3-8.0) when compared with 41 controls (16.8 +/- 3.6) p less than 0.01. In three families with parent-to-child transmission of disease, the asymptomatic parent had an enzymatic activity within the normal range. In three pedigrees where the parents were asymptomatic, enzymatic activities were below the 95% confidence limits in both. Zinc chelatase activity was below the mean control value in 17 of the 18 parents in nine affected pedigrees, and six of seven asymptomatic offspring of patients with protoporphyria. The findings suggest that EPP is not transmitted as a simple dominant trait and that inheritance of more than one gene may be required for disease expression.\r"

To further define cell-binding regions within type IV collagen, studies were performed using purified pepsin-generated triple helical fragments of type IV collagen and show that keratinocytes bind to sites within the triple-helical region of type IV collagen. To delineate specific cell adhesion promoting sequences, we studied a series of chemically synthesized peptides derived from the triple-helical region of type IV collagen. One peptide, designated Hep III, which is thirteen amino acids in length and binds heparin, was active in directly promoting keratinocyte adhesion. Furthermore, in competition assays, this peptide in solution was shown to inhibit keratinocyte adhesion to substrata coated with Hep III or intact type IV collagen. These studies show that keratinocytes bind directly to type IV collagen and chemically define a major cell-adhesion-promoting site within the triple helical region.\r"

Linoleic acid significantly decreased phagocytosis and the generation of O2-, H2O2, and OH.by neutrophils, whereas it did not significantly inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis or decrease the ROS levels generated in a cell-free, xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. The present study seems to suggest that decreased levels of linoleic acid in acne comedones contribute, in part, to the worsening of acne inflammation by the failure of low levels of linoleic acid to suppress neutrophil phagocytosis and ROS generation.\r"

The MLR response after UVB radiation was significantly decreased in comparison with the MLR response of non-radiated cells. This UV effect was partly inhibited by the tested sunscreens, whereas their vehicles alone showed hardly any effect. The protective capacity of sunscreens with similar protection factors, which were determined using the minimal erythematous dose (MED), showed a significant variation.

The presence of a relevant growth fraction is also related to widely accepted prognostic parameters in some human malignancies. Our aims were to evaluate the presence of a growth fraction with Ki67 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), and to correlate it with tumor progression and HLA-DR antigen expression in 88 melanocytic lesions. The lesions were 19 acquired melanocytic nevi, 58 primary melanomas [divided into 26 superficial spreading melanomas (SSM), 24 superficial spreading melanomas with nodular areas (SS + NM), and five nodular melanomas (NM)], and 11 metastases from malignant melanomas. Ki67 MoAb stained 16%, 19%, 71%, 100%, and 82% of nevi, SSM, SS + NM, NM, and metastases, respectively. Among primary melanomas, Ki67 MoAb stained 12%, 28%, 50%, and 70% of tumors less than 0.75, 0.75-1.49, 1.5-2.9, and greater than or equal to 3 mm thick, respectively.

We have shown that a representative growth fraction (ie, Ki67 reactivity) is present in melanocytic lesions only in advanced steps of tumor progression and correlates with HLA-DR antigen expression. Despite the different biologic values of Ki67 and HLA-DR antigens, we suggest the joint evaluation of both antigens as a useful marker of aggressive behavior in melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes a model organ-culture system for testing the toxicity of chemical substances that are topically applied to human skin. In this system, the viable keratinocytes in the full-thickness skin explants are protected by the same keratinized layer as skin remaining on the donor, and toxicity can be assessed microscopically and/or biochemically. The human skin specimens were discards from a variety of surgical procedures. They were cut into full-thickness 1.0-cm2 explants, and briefly exposed to the military vesicant sulfur mustard (SM), which was used as a model toxicant. The explants were then organ cultured in small Petri dishes for 24 h at 36 degrees C. In the 0.03-1.0% dosage range, a straight-line dose-response relationship occurred between the concentration of SM applied and the number of paranuclear vacuoles seen histologically in the epidermis. Within the same SM dosage range, there was also a proportional decrease in 14C-leucine incorporation by the explants. Thus, the number of paranuclear vacuoles reflected decreases in protein synthesis by the injured epidermal cells. The epidermis of full-thickness untreated (control) human skin explants usually remained viable for 7 d when stored at 4 degrees C in culture medium. During storage, a relatively small number of paranuclear vacuoles developed within the epidermis, but the explants were still quite satisfactory for testing SM toxicity. Incubation (for 4 or 24 h at 36 degrees C) of such control skin explants reduced (often by 50%) the small number of paranuclear vacuoles produced during 4-7 d of storage. This reduction was probably caused by autolysis of many of the vacuolated cells. Two types of paranuclear vacuoles could be identified by both light and electron microscopy: a storage type and a toxicant type. The storage type seemed to be caused by autolysis of cell components. The toxicant type seemed to be caused by an invagination of the plasma membrane. Only toxicant-type vacuoles increased appreciably in number when skin explants were exposed to mustard, and to other toxicants.\r"

  ".W": "To approach the temporal relationship between alterations in keratinization and capillary leakiness in psoriasis, we studied the topography of these anomalies in spreading psoriatic lesions. Histological and immunohistochemical studies were performed on skin biopsies obtained from normal individuals and from psoriatic patients. In the latter case, biopsies were taken in uninvolved skin, in the center of lesions, and at the edge of evolving plaques (spanning uninvolved and involved skin). Alterations in epidermal differentiation were assessed by the distribution of filagrin, involucrin, and epidermal membrane-bound transglutaminase. Capillary leakiness was evaluated by the abundance of plasma proteins such as albumin, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulin G within the epidermis. Typical alterations of epidermal differentiation were already obvious at the edge of the lesions, in areas devoid of vessel abnormalities and leakiness, or significant cellular infiltration. These results strongly suggest that, during the formation of a psoriatic plaque, defects in keratinocyte differentiation precede the development of vascular anomalies.\r"

Dermal sheets of porcine skin are maintained in culture at the air-liquid interface in serum-free medium, and re-epithelialization from the keratinocytes of the hair infundibula can be studied. Dermal sheets of different thicknesses harvested from various depths were first evaluated for viability and regenerative potential in serum-supplemented medium. Mid-dermal explants, 20/1000 inch thick, showed the greatest epithelial outgrowth from the appendigeal keratinocytes and the longest viability in vitro. Explants of this type were used in all subsequent experiments. The effects of growth factors on re-epithelialization of the explants were studied in a serum-free environment. Epidermal growth factor, cholera toxin, bombesin, and insulin-like growth factor alone and in various combinations were applied to the explant surface in aqueous solutions by micropipette. Outgrowth was assessed by computerized morphometric analysis (RS/1 program by BBN) at days four and eight. Among all factors tested, cholera toxin alone and in combination with insulin-like growth factor produced the greatest epithelial outgrowth. Nevertheless, topical applications of growth factors failed to induce complete re-epithelialization within the experimental time frame. In contrast, explants to which cultured human keratinocyte sheets were topically applied regenerated a confluent and regularly stratified epidermis within 6 d.\r"

These carbohydrates were detected, using indirect immunoperoxidase methods, both in sections of paraffin-embedded tissues and in intact cultured keratinocytes. Of the seven anti-keratan sulfate monoclonal antibodies used in this study, five detected significant amounts of epitopes associated with keratinocytes. This indicates that only certain, specific types of keratan sulfate-like carbohydrates were expressed by these cells. The extent and localization of keratan sulfate-like carbohydrates appeared to be closely related to the differentiation status of cultured keratinocytes. These epitopes were very weakly expressed on surfaces of all monolayer keratinocytes, but flattened, suprabasal cells in high Ca++ cultures strongly expressed keratan sulfate-like carbohydrates on their surfaces. A much larger population of cultured keratinocytes expressed intracellular keratan sulfate-like carbohydrates identified by the same five antibodies that detected surface epitopes. In monolayer cells, keratan sulfate-like carbohydrates were predominantly found in a broad perinuclear zone. In addition, three of the five immunoreactive antibodies detected epitopes that appeared at cell boundaries, specifically at sites of close cell-to-cell contact. Thus, molecules bearing carbohydrates recognized by anti-keratan sulfate antibodies appear at developmentally important stages of keratinocyte differentiation, indicating that these carbohydrates may serve as markers for molecules important in the differentiation of human keratinocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of 8-methoxypsoralen followed by ultraviolet A irradiation (PUVA treatment) has been used as a therapy for urticaria pigmentosa. The effect of PUVA treatment on cutaneous mast cells in mice was investigated by using giant granules of mast cells from C57BL/6-bgJ/bgJ (Chediak-Higashi syndrome) mice as a marker. C57BL/6-(+)/+ mice were lethally irradiated and rescued by bone marrow transplantation from C57BL/6-bgJ/bgJ mice. In the radiation chimeras, mast cells in the skin were of +/+ type and mast-cell precursors migrating in the bloodstream were bgJ/bgJ. When PUVA treatment was applied to the skin of the radiation chimeras, the total number of mast cells continued to decrease until the third week after the treatment and then recovered to pre-treatment levels. The initial reduction was attributed to the decrease of +/(+)-type mast cells, and the subsequent recovery to be as a result of the increase of bgJ/bgJ-type mast cells. This observation may explain the fact that the therapeutic effect of PUVA treatment is transient. Symptoms of urticaria pigmentosa become manifest after the cessation of PUVA treatment probably because new mast cells differentiate from bone marrow-derived precursors.\r"

One system (Xomed Audiant bone conductor), which uses electromagnetic induction to vibrate a subcutaneous implanted skull magnet, has now been implanted in sufficient patients in the United Kingdom, for enough time, for its indications to be evaluated. Seventeen of the total of 18 patients that have been implanted, satisfied the average threshold criterion for suitability for implantation (average bone conduction over 0.5, 1 and 2 kHz of 25 dB HL or better) yet only 10 of the 17 (59 per cent) currently use their Audiant aid. This was not because of technical reasons but was mainly influenced by the previous type of amplification. Current usage of a body level processor was 100 per cent) (6 of 6) in those that previously could only use a conventional bone conduction aid because of bilateral congenital or acquired atresia of their external auditory canals. In comparison, usage was only 36 per cent (4 of 11) in those that could potentially use a conventional ear level aid albeit with problems such as the discharge from active chronic otitis media. This relative non-use was considered due to a lack of power of the ear level processor and the general unwillingness of patients to change from an ear level to a body level device.\r"

We describe three cases of Kawasaki disease, all of which presented to the ENT department of this hospital within a period of two months. These cases illustrate the slow evolution characteristic of the disease and highlight the difficulties of diagnosis in the initial febrile stage. We emphasize the importance of considering the diagnosis when treating a young child with a pyrexia resistant to antibiotics, as prompt introduction of therapy may decrease the risk of fatal coronary artery or cardiac involvement.\r"

After short-term (3 months) treatment with L-thyroxine therapy, the development of hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of the second pregnancy, which remitted through the second and third trimesters, was observed. TBII showed a peak value (93.1%) 1 month after the onset of hyperthyroidism, and a normal value (12.4%) 6 d after delivery. One month after the second delivery, the patient developed hyperthyroidism, with an elevation of 99mTc thyroid uptake (5.58%; normal range 0.5-2.5%), which was immediately followed by transient clinical and biochemical hypothyroidism. Concomitant increases in MCHA titre and TBII activity were observed after delivery, and both reached peak levels (1:409600 and 81.0%, respectively) one and a half months after the onset of hypothyroidism. Thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb), measured using FRTL-5 thyroid cells, was detected at a weakly positive level (161%) on initial examination, and the serial change in TSAb was almost identical to that in TBII. Patients with Graves' disease may develop Graves' type hyperthyroidism, followed immediately by transient hypothyroidism due to coexisting destructive autoimmune thyroiditis during the early postpartum period, despite increasing TSAb activity.\r"

Seventy-one patients had venographically verified DVT, which in 21 cases was restricted to the calf. Plethysmography (PG) gave a sensitivity and specificity of 63% and 94%, respectively. The former was influenced by a limited sensitivity of 14% in the sub-group with distal DVT. The sensitivity and specificity of temperature profiles (TP) were 87% and 39%, respectively, while the corresponding values for thermo-camera (TC) were 83% and 55%, respectively. Using a combined diagnostic approach of PG and TP, additional evaluation of posterior and lateral profiles and pattern recognition, 96% sensitivity and 81% specificity were reached. The combination of PG and TP will be an essential diagnostic complement when venography is not possible or inconclusive, as well as having a role in diagnostic screening in a large number of patients.\r"

Ten patients with renal failure and hyperkalaemia (serum potassium concentration greater than 6 mmol l-1) were given 15 mg salbutamol via a nebulizer over a 30-min period. Serum potassium was measured 30, 60, 180 and 360 min thereafter. All patients had end-stage renal failure on chronic hospital haemodialysis. Serum potassium levels decreased significantly from a pretreatment value of 6.5 +/- 0.6 mmol l-1 to 5.6 +/- 0.6 mmol-1 after 30 min, and this level was maintained for 3 h. Six hours after treatment, the serum potassium concentration was 6 +/- 0.7 mmol l-1. There was a modest increase in heart rate and blood glucose level, but otherwise salbutamol was well tolerated and no serious side-effects occurred. It is concluded that the administration of salbutamol by inhalation is a simple, safe and reasonably effective method for treatment of hyperkalaemia in renal failure.\r"

We have studied muscle biopsy specimens taken before and after exercise to exhaustion (24 min at 20-25 W) in a young woman with this condition. Marked glycogenolysis with lactate production and marked phosphagen breakdown (ATP + CP) were observed after exercise, and almost all type I fibres were found to be depleted of glycogen. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity was low, while the activities of 3-OH-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, phosphorylase and lactate dehydrogenase were normal. On electron microscopy, the mitochondria showed abnormalities typical of mitochondrial myopathy. The findings in our patient suggest a limitation of mitochondrial function, probably related to SDH in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and complex II in the electron transport chain. This may explain the inability of ATP regeneration to keep pace with ATP utilization during exercise. Other metabolic defects may coexist.\r"

Several venous blood samples were collected before (to obtain the baseline concentration) and after an intravenous dose of erythropoietin. A radioimmunoassay was used to determine the erythropoietin concentration in the samples. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state was 4.2 +/- 0.91 (initial dose) and 3.7 +/- 0.61 (repeated dosing), which is close to the assumed plasma volume in these patients. The half-life was 5.3 +/- 1.3 h and 5.8 +/- 1.2 h in the two groups, respectively, and is therefore too short for any accumulation to be expected when dosing three times per week. Consequently, no difference in baseline values could be detected between the groups. The clearance of erythropoietin in the groups was estimated to be 11.4 +/- 7.0 ml min-1 and 7.8 +/- 3.8 ml min-1, respectively. Erythropoietin kinetics did not differ after repeated dosing compared to the single initial dose. Intravenous administration of erythropoietin will result in high peak concentrations followed by a rapid decline to basal values.\r"

From the pool of 811 responders (63.3%), all 122 individuals who fulfilled our inclusion criteria were assigned to one of four groups: (1) no CVD, non-smokers; (2) no CVD, smokers; (3) CVD, smokers; (4) CVD, non-smokers. A telephone interview with 75 non-responders suggested that this group contained more institutionalized subjects, but otherwise did not differ from the group of participants. Subjects with CVD had higher levels of plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol than those without CVD, whereas plasma HDL cholesterol and plasma triglyceride concentrations did not differ between the groups; thus the LDL/HDL ratio was higher in the CVD group. Lipoprotein concentrations did not differ between smokers and non-smokers. However, the mean cholesterol levels were low (5.19 +/- 1.01 mmol l-1), suggesting selective mortality. No differences between the groups were found with regard to Lp(a). The mean blood pressure for the whole group was 149/79 mmHg, and there were no differences between subgroups. Our study suggests that mechanisms such as selective mortality modify the risk factor pattern in the elderly. In 80-year-old individuals, elevated LDL cholesterol levels can still be identified as a risk indicator for CVD, whereas there does not appear to be any association between CVD or low HDL levels or elevated blood pressure in this age group.\r"

Cox regression analyses with and without adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors revealed a significant (p less than 0.05) quadratic association between BMI and all-causes mortality among men, but not women, after an average 8.4 years of follow-up; mortality was relatively high at both extremes of the BMI distribution. The association was stronger among smokers compared with nonsmokers, and it was apparent among male normotensives, but not hypertensives. All TSF-mortality associations and BMI associations with cancer and coronary heart disease mortality were weak and nonsignificant. Among men, per cent weight change in adulthood showed a significant inverse association with all-causes and cancer mortality. Because BMI and weight history were significantly associated with mortality after adjustment for other risk factors, they appear to be independent predictors of mortality among men.\r"

The study showed that increased use of pediatricians on the part of Mississauga children in comparison to Brampton children resulted in a higher proportion being placed on anti-asthmatic medications even though the underlying prevalence rate of wheezing and coughing was the same in the two samples. Further study is required to determine whether differences in primary care between the two samples can explain a two-fold increase in hospital admission rates for lower respiratory illness among Brampton preschool children in comparison to their counterparts in Mississauga.\r"

Data were collected by questionnaire in 1982. Mortality was determined 4 years later; 111 deaths were registered. The analysis of age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) showed strong relationships between mortality and disability (OR = 7.75), compared health (OR = 3.94), self-rated health (OR = 2.47), home comfort (OR = 0.52), physical activity (OR = 0.32), sociability (OR = 0.43) and two subjective well-being items: the feeling of uselessness (OR = 3.51), and the lack of projects for the future (OR = 2.35). By contrast, no significant association was observed with reported morbidity and social support. Two multivariate analyses were performed: the first on longevity using Cox's regression model, the second on mortality using a linear discriminant analysis. The results of these analyses were translated into a simple set of 8 independent risk markers for the identification of a \"high risk group\" of mortality within 4 years. The sensitivity of this mortality risk indicator was 73% and its specificity 77%.\r"

This problem is investigated using data on repeated cholesterol measurements for 14,600 men and women in the MRC Mild Hypertension Trial. For measurements 1 year apart, the within-person coefficient of variation (CV) is 7%, which is substantial compared with the between-person CV of 15%. In a screening programme, this within-person variability may lead to the misclassification of individuals and inappropriate intervention. For example, 28% of middle-aged British men with a single cholesterol measurement above 6.9 mmol/l have a long-term average cholesterol below that value even without intervention. Using averages of several cholesterol measurements reduces, but does not eliminate, these problems. Furthermore, monitoring the effect of interventions in individuals by sequential cholesterol measurement may be unhelpful or even misleading. These problems cast serious doubt on the value of general population screening for high cholesterol levels.\r"

The cohort method estimate was 237 per 100,000 population (95% confidence limits (CL), 165-310). The discrepancy was due to 18 cases of TIA noted at the time of patient visits in the cohort analysis that were not identified from the medical record analysis. The cohort analysis for all strokes at age 50 years and older was not significantly different from the medical record linkage analysis. Although the cohort follow-up method provided better case ascertainment in this study, current indexing procedures provide case ascertainment equal to that of the cohort method and at less cost. No trend was found to suggest that incidence rates for TIA were decreasing in the period 1955-1979, in contrast to stroke in Rochester, Minn.\r"

Four readers (2 radiologists and 2 clinical hematologists) independently scored, on two separate occasions, the RVI on 40 radiographs from patients with myeloma. Each vertebra from third thoracic (T3) to fifth lumbar (L5) received a score of \"1\" if normal, \"2\" if biconcave and \"4\" if crushed or fractured. RVI global scores, therefore, could vary from a minimum of 15, for no damage, to a potential maximum of 60 in which all vertebrae are collapsed. Agreement was determined for each vertebra using crude percentage agreement and the kappa statistic (which corrects for chance-expected agreement) for categorical data, and for global score using analysis of variance and calculating intra-class correlation. With increasing mean abnormality score on individual vertebrae there was a corresponding increase in kappa and reduction in crude percentage agreement. Within readers, the mean percentage agreement across all vertebrae varied from 85.6 to 90.3% and the observed differences just reach statistical significance (p = 0.048). Mean kappa values ranged from 0.48 to 0.63 and were similar across readers. Differences in intra-reader agreement were not related to subspecialty. When between reader percentage agreement and kappa scores were assessed for radiologists and non-radiologist clinicians, no difference could be detected. Agreement with respect to intra-reader mean global RVI scores was excellent as illustrated by the intra-class correlation coefficient which varied from 0.89 to 0.94. The mean intra-class correlation for radiologists was 0.92, compared with 0.91 for non-radiologists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study, based on dissection of human cadavers, describes the use of this approach for the management of intradural lesions in the region of the clivus. Its main advantages include avoidance of brain retraction, the use of an extrapharyngeal route, and exposure of the ventral aspect of the pons and medulla and related structures caudal to the trigeminal root. This approach can easily be combined with an intradural subtemporal approach to provide additional exposure of the superior clivus rostral to the trigeminal root. Combining the two approaches provides direct access to the ventral surface of the entire brain stem from the dorsum sellae to the hypoglossal foramina. Five patients with lesions in the clivus and petrous apex have been operated on via this approach. Details of the anatomical aspects of the approach and its applications are presented.\r"

The deficits produced include sensory, motor, bowel, and bladder dysfunction, and vary in incidence between the pediatric and adult populations. Twenty patients treated surgically at the Mount Sinai Hospital between 1972 and 1988 are reviewed. Fifty percent were 12 years of age or less and 50% were older than 18 years of age. The surgical approach was designed to accomplish untethering of the conus medullaris, debulking of the lipomatous mass compressing the cord, reconstruction of the dural canal, and reapproximation of the paraspinal muscles and lumbosacral fascia to prevent future trauma. Postoperatively, no patient experienced deterioration of neurological function. Of the symptomatic patients. 67% displayed dramatic improvement or became asymptomatic and 33% experienced stabilization of their deficits. The symptoms most resistant to surgical correction were orthopedic foot deformities and bowel dysfunction, whereas bladder dysfunction, motor weakness, and radiculopathies were most amenable to surgical therapy. Early surgical repair is recommended in these cases to forestall irreversible neurological damage.\r"

  ".W": "Intravascular volume expansion has been successfully employed to promote blood flow in ischemic brain regions. This effect has been attributed to both decreased blood viscosity and increased cardiac output resulting from volume expansion. The physiological mechanism by which changes in cardiac output would affect cerebral blood flow (CBF), independent of blood pressure variations, is unclear, but impaired cerebral autoregulation is believed to play a role. In order to evaluate the relationship between cardiac output and CBF when autoregulation is either intact or defective, 135 simultaneous measurements of cardiac output (thermodilution method) and CBF (by the 133Xe inhalation or intravenous injection method) were performed in 35 severely head-injured patients. In 81 instances, these measurements were performed after manipulation of blood pressure with phenylephrine or Arfonad (trimethaphan camsylate), or manipulation of blood viscosity with mannitol. Autoregulation was found to be intact in 55 of these cases and defective in 26. A wide range of changes in cardiac output occurred after administration of each drug. No correlation existed between the changes in cardiac output and the changes in CBF, regardless of the status of blood pressure autoregulation. A significant (40%) increase in CBF was found after administration of mannitol when autoregulation was defective. These data support the hypothesis that, within broad limits, CBF is not related to cardiac output, even when autoregulation is impaired. Thus, the effect of intravascular volume expansion appears to be mediated by decreased blood viscosity rather than cardiac output augmentation.\r"

In the pediatric achondroplastic patient, such stenosis may lead to cervicomedullary compression with serious sequelae, including paresis, hypertonia, delayed motor mile-stones, and respiratory compromise. Using a standardized protocol the authors have treated 15 young achondroplastic patients with documented cervicomedullary compression by craniocervical decompression and duroplasty. Following this procedure, significant improvement in presenting neurological or respiratory complaints was noted in all patients. The mortality rate in this series was zero. The major cause of morbidity associated with this procedure was perioperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the surgical wound, presumably related to coexisting abnormalities of CSF dynamics. This problem was successfully managed by temporary or, when necessary, permanent CSF diversion procedures. It is concluded that craniocervical decompression is an effective and safe treatment for young achondroplastic patients with cervicomedullary compression.\r"

Preoperative CT scans were obtained in all cases and revealed no enhancing lesions. All patients underwent craniotomy with electrocorticography while awake, followed by lobectomy. Computerized tomography scans with and without administration of contrast material were obtained on postoperative Days 3, 7, and 30. Edema, artifact, and enhancement of the resection margins were seen on postoperative Days 3 and 7, but had resolved in all patients by Day 30. It is concluded that postoperative CT scans for assessment of residual tumor are best obtained at 30 days or thereafter, when normal brain does not enhance and edema and artifact have diminished.\r"

The reliability of the LI as a predictor of patient survival or recurrence was examined in this study of 66 human brain tumors (19 gliomas, 18 meningiomas, and 29 others). Anti-BUdR staining was performed on surgically extirpated tumor tissue that had been treated with BUdR as previously described. Correlation of the BUdR LI with patient survival or tumor recurrence rate was carried out by the method of Kaplan and Meier. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) aneuploidy was estimated in 52 cases. The results of this study indicate that BUdR LI values correlated well with the clinical course of patients with brain tumor. In comparison with patients with higher LI's, there was both a significantly higher survival rate for tumors other than meningiomas and a higher recurrence-free rate for meningiomas in patients with LI's of less than 4% and 1%, respectively. Although there was a tendency for patients without tumor aneuploidy to show better survival data than the others, no statistical difference was observed. These results suggest that the in vitro BUdR labeling method is reliable for prediction of a patient's prognosis, whereas prognosis on the basis of DNA aneuploidy alone is uncertain.\r"

In an attempt to examine this assumption, multimodal pain ratings were recorded for 14 patients with spinal cord injury due to a gunshot wound in whom the bullet was still present, 14 neurologically matched patients with spinal cord injury due to a gunshot wound in whom the bullet was removed, and 28 control patients with spinal cord injury unrelated to a gunshot wound who were neurologically matched to the first two groups. The results suggest that persons who sustain a spinal cord injury secondary to gunshot wounds report more pain than those injured in other ways. In addition, there was no indication that surgical removal of the bullet was helpful in reducing subsequent pain either early in the rehabilitation process or at 1 year postinjury. The location of the bullet and the type of pain that subsequently developed were not correlated with the initial decision to surgically remove the bullet. Implications for further study and clinical practice are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90347515\r", 
  ".W": "In the past, pain control for chronic pain syndromes using narcotic infusion has been carried out primarily via the intrathecal (subarachnoid) route. This report presents one of the first large series of terminally ill cancer patients with intractable pain treated with continuous epidural morphine infusions by means of implanted pumps and epidural spinal catheters. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate that the epidural route is effective with minimal complications, and that screening with temporary epidural catheter infusions results in a high rate of subsequent pain relief. A multidisciplinary team (neurosurgeon, anesthesiologists, psychiatrists, oncologists, and nurse clinicians) evaluated and treated all of the patients studied. Percutaneous placement of temporary epidural catheters for a trial assessment was performed by the anesthesiologists. Pain evaluations were conducted independently by psychiatrists using both verbal and visual analog scales. From 1982 to 1988, 41 (59.4%) of 69 patients evaluated for eligibility experienced good pain control during trial assessment and were subsequently implanted with Infusaid infusion pumps. Preinfusion pain analog values were 8.6 +/- 0.3 and postimplantation values at 1 month were 3.8 +/- 0.4 (p less than 0.001). Over this same 1-month period. requirements of systemic morphine equivalents decreased by 79.3% with epidural infusions as compared to preinfusion requirements (p less than 0.001). There were no instances of epidural scarring, respiratory depression, epidural infections, meningitis, or catheter blockage. One patient developed apparent drug tolerance and three patients required further catheter manipulations. This series strongly suggests that significant reductions in cancer pain can be obtained with few complications and a low morphine tolerance rate using chronic epidural morphine infusion. Anesthesiology and psychiatry input, along with temporary catheter infusion screening and quantitative pain evaluations using analog scales, are essential.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate microcirculatory disturbance and cerebral edema associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), both stereological morphometry on the intraparenchymal capillary network and microgravimetry were performed on a rabbit SAH model. Autologous arterial blood (5 ml) was injected into the cisterna magna, and the animals were sacrificed at intervals of 6 hours, 1 day, 2 days, or 6 days after SAH. Capillaries in the piriform cortex, parasagittal cortex, and ventral brain stem of the midline-hemisectioned brain were injected with Evans blue dye 1 minute before sacrifice, and were planimetrically evaluated under a fluorescence microscope connected to an image analysis system. Stereological and morphological parameters including the volume density, surface density, numerical density, minimum intercapillary distance, and the diameter of Evans blue-perfused capillaries were also computed. In the piriform cortex and ventral brain stem, the volume and surface densities were significantly reduced and the minimum intercapillary distance was significantly increased 1 to 2 days after SAH. In the parasagittal cortex far from the cisternal clot, changes in the parameters were minimal. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the normal condition and edema formation associated with SAH were studied by the microgravimetric technique. The mean CBV in the parasagittal cortex, piriform cortex, and brain stem was 6.9%, 6.8%, and 5.6%, respectively. Following SAH, specific gravity in the piriform cortex and the ventral brain stem of the other side of the hemisectioned brain was significantly decreased at 1 to 2 days, showing a change parallel to that of the stereological parameters. The results obtained from the morphometric technique indicated the occurrence of impaired capillary perfusion and reduced capillary blood volume following SAH, while microgravimetry suggested the formation of brain edema during this period. These changes in the intraparenchymal vessels may play an important role in the pathophysiology of SAH.\r"

Because adrenal chromaffin cell viability may be limited by the low levels of available nerve growth factor (NGF) in the striatum, the present study was conducted to determine if transected peripheral nerve segments could provide sufficient levels of NGF to enhance chromaffin cell survival in vitro and in vivo. Aged female rhesus monkeys, rendered hemiparkinsonian by the drug MPTP (n-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine), received autografts into the striatum using a stereotactic approach, of either sural nerve or adrenal medulla, or cografts of adrenal medulla and sural nerve (three animals in each group). Cell cultures were established from tissue not used in the grafts. Adrenal chromaffin cells either cocultured with sural nerve segments or exposed to exogenous NGF differentiated into a neuronal phenotype. Chromaffin cell survival, when cografted with sural nerve into the striatum, was enhanced four- to eightfold from between 8000 and 18,000 surviving cells in grafts of adrenal tissue only up to 67,000 surviving chromaffin cells in cografts. In grafts of adrenal tissue only, the implant site consisted of an inflammatory focus. Surviving chromaffin cells, which could be identified by both chromogranin A and tyrosine hydroxylase staining, retained their endocrine phenotype. Cografted chromaffin cells exhibited multipolar neuritic processes and numerous chromaffin granules, and were also immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase and chromogranin A. Blood vessels within the graft were fenestrated, indicating that the blood-brain barrier was not intact. Additionally, cografted chromaffin cells were observed in a postsynaptic relationship with axon terminals from an undetermined but presumably a host origin.\r"

  ".U": "90347519\r", 
  ".W": "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is produced by glioma cells. However, there is heterogeneity among glioma cell lines in the production of PDGF. It has been demonstrated that U251MG cells produce a PDGF-like molecule while U105MG cells do not. Trapidil, a specific antagonist of PDGF, competes for receptor binding with PDGF. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of trapidil on the proliferation of glioma cells was investigated in vitro using two glioma cell lines. At 100 micrograms/ml, trapidil significantly inhibited the proliferation of U251MG cells (which produce the PDGF-like molecule). At the same trapidil concentration, the proliferation of U105MG cells (which do not produce the PDGF-like molecule) was not inhibited. The inhibitory effect of trapidil was remarkable on Days 3 and 4 of culture. After 4 days of incubation, the proliferation of U251MG cells was 46% of the control preparation. Trapidil enhanced the antitumor effect of 3-[4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)ethyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (ACNU) against U251MG cells. The enhancing effect was highest on Days 4 and 6 of culture. After 6 days of incubation in the presence of 100 micrograms/ml trapidil and 1 microgram/ml ACNU, the proliferation of U251MG cells was 18% of the control preparation. These findings suggest that trapidil interrupts the autocrine loop at the PDGF and PDGF-receptor level and that combination therapy with trapidil and ACNU may be useful in the treatment of glioma.\r"

At surgery, these neoplasms were well-circumscribed red fleshy tumors. Histological examination of one paraganglioma showed a superficial resemblance to ependymoma, and this may be particularly true on initial assessment by frozen section or smear. The use of electron microscopy and immunohistochemical demonstration of synaptophysin in these tumors allowed a confident diagnosis to be made. Neurochemical assessment in one case showed very high levels of serotonin and a turnover of dopamine similar to that of human cerebral cortex. Paraganglioma of the cauda equina is an uncommon tumor with just over 50 cases reported in the world literature. The clinical course of these tumors is benign and they should be completely removed at surgery to prevent later recurrence.\r"

A case of traumatic periodontoid cicatrix is presented in which posterior fusion resulted in reduction of the anterior mass lesion, clearly demonstrated by MR imaging. The etiology of periodontoid hypertrophic scarring, both traumatic and rheumatoid, is discussed in light of MR findings, and treatment implications are considered.\r"

  ".W": "Ten patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have been evaluated as candidates for experimental radioimmunotherapy and five of those patients have been treated with a single high dose of iodine-131-(131I) labeled anti-pan B-cell antibodies. The evaluation protocol involved collecting biodistribution data by quantitation of gamma camera images and by tumor biopsy from trace labeled doses of antibody, to estimate the relative radiation dose delivered to normal organs and tumor sites. Each patient received up to three escalating mass doses (0.5 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, and 10.0 mg/kg) of radioiodinated antibody for determination of the antibody amount that yielded the most favorable biodistribution for treatment. The millicuries of 131I-labeled to the optimal antibody dose for therapy was selected to deliver 1,000 rads (three patients) or 1,500 rads (two patients) to normal uninvolved organs. Because severe bone marrow toxicity was expected, all patients had their bone marrow cryopreserved prior to entry into the study. This report details the methods and results of quantitative imaging, biodistribution data collection, and absorbed radiation dose estimation in patients with lymphoma receiving high level radioimmunotherapy with 131I-labeled antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Resting tomographic myocardial perfusion images using technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxy-2-methylpropyl-isonitrile (Tc-Sestamibi) were obtained in 25 patients during their first myocardial infarction. Tc-Sestamibi was injected intravenously before acute reperfusion therapy, and repeated twice, at 18-48 hr, and at 6 to 14 days. Reperfusion was successful in 19 patients. In the patients with successful reperfusion, there was a mean decrease in the amount of hypoperfused myocardium between the initial and second studies (-9% +/- 12%, p = 0.004) and a further decrease between the second and final studies (-10% +/- 12%, p = 0.002). Nine of these 19 patients (47%) had evidence of significant improvement at the time of the second study. In six patients, significant improvement was not evident until the final study. Although tomographic imaging with Tc-Sestamibi following reperfusion therapy may show improvement in perfusion at 18-48 hr, the full extent of improvement is usually not evident until later.\r"
