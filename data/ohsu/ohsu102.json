She was treated with acyclovir and recovered completely to deliver a normal child per vaginam at term. She had no evidence of genital or disseminated herpes virus infection. This paper illustrates that (1) the outcome of HSE in pregnancy can be favorable both for the mother and the offspring, (2) early diagnosis and use of acyclovir therapy is essential for successful outcome, and (3) the use of acyclovir in the third trimester of pregnancy was not harmful to the mother or fetus.\r"

The effect of levodopa on akinesia, rigidity, and tremor remained quite stable during the course of the disease. In contrast, the aggravation of gait disorder, postural instability, and dysarthria was more severe, with decreased percentage of improvement on levodopa in patients with longer evolution. It is suggested that aggravation of Parkinson's disease mainly results from increasing severity of cerebral nondopaminergic lesions.\r"

Clinical data were suggestive of repeated strokes in the vertebrobasilar territory, mainly affecting the right dorsolateral medulla oblongata including the vestibular nuclei. A paroxysmal attack of nystagmus and vertigo evoked by voluntary lateral eye position is an unusual clinical finding. This is discussed in the light of multisensory integration within the vestibular system, which also includes eye position information.\r"

To address it, we analyzed data from a ten- to 13-year mortality follow-up of the 3437 women enrolled in the Walnut Creek Contraceptive Drug Study who never used either estrogens or oral contraceptives and the 2656 women who used estrogens but not oral contraceptives. By 1983, 109 estrogen users and 110 nonusers had died. After adjusting for age, mortality in estrogen users (1.64 per 1000 woman-years) was lower than in nonusers (2.06 per 1000 woman-years) for all categories of cause of death except cancer. The lower mortality from accidents, suicide, and homicide in estrogen users has no plausible biologic explanation, and the observation suggests that life-style differences between estrogen users and nonusers account at least in part for their lower mortality. On the other hand, the observation that the relative risk of mortality due to cardiovascular disease was 0.5 in estrogen users, after adjustment for age and other cardiovascular disease risk factors, is suggestive.\r"

One hundred twenty patients had had hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive neoplasia, 54 for noncervical anogenital cancer, and 442 for benign uterine disorders. Human papillomavirus DNA was detected in 18% of all vaginal smears. A history of cervical neoplasia was associated with a significantly higher human papillomavirus infection rate, compared with patients with benign disease (33 versus 14%). Human papillomaviruses 16 and 18 were the most common types detected in patients with a history of cervical carcinoma, whereas the majority of patients with benign uterine disease were infected with human papillomavirus 6/11. Colposcopy identified lesions in more than half of the patients; these appeared in more than 90% as \"condylomatous vaginitis.\" In 5% of the human papillomavirus-positive patients, human papillomavirus 16-positive vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia could be diagnosed. Increased risk of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia after hysterectomy is associated with vaginal human papillomavirus infection. Virologic results explain the higher risk for vaginal neoplasia in patients with a history of cervical neoplasia.\r"

To investigate the efficacy of diagnostic methods, we examined the 127 male sexual partners of 127 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Eighty-three mostly asymptomatic men (65%) had from one to 50 (median three) small (median 3 mm) human papillomavirus-associated lesions consisting of condylomata (80 cases) and penile dysplasia (three cases). The colposcope aided diagnosis or was necessary for diagnosis of 59% of the lesions. Routine application of 3% or 5% acetic acid yielded white or grayish epithelial changes in 22% of the cases, which would have been missed without this technique. Papular, flat, spiked, and mixed lesions were more common (85%) than papillary changes or classic condylomata acuminata (15%). In contrast to smears from the external penile surface, smears obtained from the male urethra were satisfactory in most cases and yielded positive results in nine men (7%). Condylomata are common in male partners of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, but the lesions are frequently not apparent unless magnification and acetic acid are used. Cytologic smears may aid in the diagnosis of condylomata in the urethra.\r"

There were no recognized adverse sequelae from either intravasation or embolization. Intravasation was frequently associated with pathology of the upper genital tract, and suspected tubal occlusion was the most common abnormality detected. Proper timing of the procedure and avoidance of excessive instillation pressure will diminish the incidence of this complication.

Patients in the labetalol group demonstrated a statistically significant (P less than .005) decrease in blood pressure during treatment. No such decrease occurred in the hospitalization-alone group. Both groups exhibited significant deterioration in proteinuria, creatinine, and uric acid. The average days of pregnancy prolongation (mean +/- SD) were 21.3 +/- 13 and 20.1 +/- 14 days in the hospitalization and labetalol groups, respectively. There were no differences between the groups regarding any of the following: gestational age at delivery, birth weight, number of infants admitted to the special care unit, or cord blood gas measurements. However, the incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants was significantly higher in the labetalol group (19 versus 9%, P less than .05). There were no stillbirths, but one neonatal death in the labetalol group. Treatment of maternal blood pressure in preeclamptic pregnancies with labetalol did not improve perinatal outcome, and was associated with a higher frequency of fetal growth retardation.\r"

Thrombocytopenia occurred in 50% of the preeclamptic patients, and was accompanied by qualitative platelet defects as shown by an increased bleeding time and decreased biosynthesis of thromboxane A2. All patients had normal routine coagulation and protamine sulphate paracoagulation assays. All nulliparous patients had normal levels of fibrinopeptide A, but approximately 60% of parous patients had slight elevations of fibrinopeptide A. Elevated levels of platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (IgG) were demonstrated in 35% of all preeclamptic patients and were inversely correlated (r = -0.524) with the severity of the thrombocytopenia. This study indicates that, at least in nulliparous patients, thrombin action is not a major contributor to the development of thrombocytopenia in preeclampsia. The observation of elevated levels of platelet-associated IgG suggests that immune mechanisms could contribute to the thrombocytopenia in some patients.\r"

  ".U": "87316177\r", 
  ".W": "Nine patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension and nine healthy pregnant controls were compared in the last trimester with regard to cardiovascular and sympathoadrenal reactivity during a standardized isometric handgrip exercise test. At rest, the blood pressure elevation with pregnancy-induced hypertension resulted from increased systemic vascular resistance. The test increased the blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, and epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations in arterial plasma, but did not change the calf or systemic vascular resistance. The responses of the two groups did not differ significantly with regard to any of the above variables. Thus, pregnancy-induced hypertension does not seem to be associated with exaggerated cardiovascular or sympathoadrenal reactivity to isometric exercise when compared with normal pregnancy. The mechanism underlying the blood pressure response appears to be similar in the two groups, ie, an increase in cardiac output.\r"

This report reviews cases of sarcoidosis and pregnancy during a ten-year period at Downstate Medical Center. Eleven patients were stable, two experienced disease progression, and two died from complications of severe sarcoidosis. Factors indicating a poor prognosis included parenchymal lesions on chest x-ray, advanced roentgenologic staging, advanced maternal age, low inflammatory activity, requirement for drugs other than steroids, and presence of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis. Management plans are delineated for patients with advanced sarcoidosis. Some patients require evaluation before pregnancy to establish chronicity, baseline pulmonary function, inflammatory activity, roentgenographic staging, and response to treatment. Only then can the patient be given an accurate prognosis for either an uncomplicated pregnancy or one requiring intensive management by the pulmonary and perinatal teams.\r"

Women with cervical cancer were less likely than matched controls to have had regular Papanicolaou test screening, to have received a Papanicolaou test within the last five years, or to have obtained a Papanicolaou test from an obstetrician-gynecologist. After controlling for traditional risk factors, we found that receiving any Papanicolaou tests within the last five years from an obstetrician-gynecologist was more protective than receiving Papanicolaou tests from other providers, although the difference did not attain statistical significance. Among both cases and controls, younger women and women who had used prescription contraceptives were more likely to have had a recent Papanicolaou test by an obstetrician-gynecologist. The results support the importance of regular Papanicolaou test screening among older women and suggest that the obstetrician-gynecologist helps prevent cervical cancer by providing continuity of screening services.\r"

The sample comprised 69 community-dwelling women, ages 55 years and older, who were ambulatory and mentally intact, and who had volunteered in a clinical trial on incontinence. Psychosocial impact was measured by an investigator-designed instrument, the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire. Urodynamic evaluation included detrusor and urethral sphincteric function tests. Subjects were grouped into two urodynamic diagnostic categories: sphincteric incompetence (N = 47) and detrusor instability with or without concomitant sphincteric incompetence (N = 22). Severity of incontinence was determined by a one-week urinary diary and a fluid loss quantitation test. Each of the items on the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire was affected by urinary incontinence, although to varying degrees. Activities involving unfamiliar places where the availability of restrooms was unknown were most affected. Subjects with detrusor instability with or without concomitant sphincteric incompetence reported significantly higher impact than subjects with sphincteric incompetence alone. There were modest correlations between psychosocial impact scores and both the number of weekly incontinent episodes and the quantitation of fluid loss. The results in this study population indicate that the relationships between the perceived impact of incontinence and objective measures of its severity are complex and not directly proportionate.\r"

Urodynamics, provocative testing, and home pad tests with urinary dye all failed to prove incontinence. A common historic feature was replacement therapy with unopposed conjugated estrogen. Addition of a progestational agent to the estrogen replacement regimen eliminated the fluid loss per vagina in six of the seven women and improved it in the remaining patient. Unnecessary surgery and evaluation might have been prevented had this condition been recognized earlier.\r"

Analysis of resident incident cases shows that 82% were localized to the uterus, and more than 85% of these women were already symptomatic. Older women represent particularly difficult problems, both technical (cervical stenosis) and in recruitment. Because the natural history of the precursor lesions of corpus uteri cancer are not yet well established, use of this method for systematic population screening of asymptomatic women is questionable.\r"

The prevalence of AIDS-related complex and human immunodeficiency virus in the United States is far greater than these numbers. The CDC has recommended screening those pregnant women with risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus. With the help of a wide range of professionals, we have developed a screening protocol for human immunodeficiency virus in pregnancy. In the first six months, 3-4% of prenatal patients used this counseling service, and 11 human immunodeficiency virus-positive women delivered. This paper discusses the medical and ethical issues that were raised and the problems that we faced in establishing this protocol.\r"

A rapid, sensitive, and simple non-radioactive serum estrogen assay was developed by modifying a hemagglutination-inhibition kit (Hi-Estrotec) originally designed to measure total urinary estrogens. With a minimum sensitivity of 100 pg of 17-beta-estradiol, the modified procedure generally takes less than 2.5 hours to complete and requires no special equipment or instrumentation. Randomly obtained serum samples assayed by both the hemagglutination-inhibition assay and radioimmunoassay achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.885 (P less than .001). Comparison of serum obtained from women undergoing ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropin-human chorionic gonadotropin measured by both techniques showed the same fluctuation pattern for serum estradiol levels during the stimulated cycles. The rapidity and reproducibility of this serum estrogen assay make it suitable for office use in monitoring ovulation induction and superovulation in in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer programs.\r"

This pattern is consistent with a \"fast metabolism\" of quinidine. There is substantial evidence that 3-hydroxyquinidine has pharmacologic activity. We conclude that elevated levels of 3-hydroxyquinidine can be associated with a clinically significant quinidine toxicity. This can occur in the presence of a nontoxic serum quinidine level. We also measured the levels of quinidine and 3-hydroxyquinidine in the amniotic fluid and cord blood. The levels in the cord blood were 31 and 27%, respectively, of those in a simultaneously drawn maternal blood sample.\r"

Excellent diabetic control was associated with euglycemia, normal glycosylated hemoglobin concentration, and a significant decrease in mean 24-hour plasma C-peptide (P less than .004) and glucagon (P less than .003) levels. Unexpectedly, fetal growth accelerated during constant insulin infusion despite normal maternal plasma glucose levels. The newborn infant was large (4530 g), with a striking truncal accumulation of fat, hypoglycemia (30-minute plasma glucose 11 mg/dL), and polycythemia (central venous hematocrit 71%). Normalization of maternal plasma glucose levels failed to ameliorate established macrosomia, and did not prevent the neonatal complications that are common in infants of diabetic mothers.\r"

The more differentiated tissues were usually circumscribed by fibrocellular bands of spindle-shaped cells that seemed to have transformed into rounded cartilaginous cells. Presumably this tumor arose from undifferentiated mesenchymal cells in the myometrium, which proliferated to form fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. The tumor may be designated fibrio-osteochondroma. It is histologically benign and exceedingly rare.\r"

Residual disease was found in six of 34 cases (18%) of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and zero of 12 cases of early stromal invasion after complete excision, and in 13 of 31 cases (42%) of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and four of seven cases (57%) of early stromal invasion after incomplete excision by cone biopsy. Sixteen of 28 women (57%) with abnormal cytology after cone biopsy were found to have residual disease at the time of hysterectomy. In contrast, no residual disease was found in 35 patients who had no evidence of cytologic abnormality after the initial treatment. The finding of abnormal cytology after cone biopsy is shown to be a more useful prognostic indicator than histologic examination of excision margins. Therefore, we believe that a policy of expectant management, based on regular cytologic examination, is justified when histologic assessment has shown the lesion to extend to the line of excision.\r"

Evaluation of histologic slides demonstrated persistent intraluminal trophoblastic tissue without invasion in two patients, and extraluminal invasion into the tubal wall in one patient. The use of postoperative serial beta-hCG titers might facilitate recognition of this complication in time to prevent further tubal damage and hemorrhage.\r"

Of ten condylomas, 80% contained DNA related to human papillomavirus 6 or 11. Sixty percent had evidence of DNA related to human papillomavirus 16, and 30% contained DNA related to human papillomavirus 18. Of 24 squamous cervical carcinomas, 58% had human papillomavirus type 16-related DNA, 33% had type 6- or 11-related DNA, and 4% had type 18-related DNA. Nine primary or recurrent vulvar carcinomas were analyzed. Seventy-eight percent contained human papillomavirus type 6- or 11-related DNA, 33% type 16-related DNA, and 22% type 18-related DNA. Whereas invasive cervical carcinomas predominantly contained DNA related to human papillomavirus 16 or 18, invasive vulvar carcinomas predominantly contained DNA related to types 6 or 11. Thus, human papillomavirus type alone cannot distinguish benign from malignant epithelial disease in the female genital tract.\r"

The mean stage of gestation was 27 weeks (range 21-33 weeks). Initial hematologic indices (mean +/- SEM) were: hematocrit 36.5 +/- 0.4%, serum ferritin 32.6 +/- 6.1 ng/mL, and serum iron 117 +/- 13 micrograms/dL. Iron therapy, prescribed by the obstetric caregivers, provided a total average daily elemental iron intake of 261 mg (range 164-395 mg) from therapy and routine supplements. Laboratory studies of zinc status were obtained immediately before iron therapy and at one and four weeks thereafter. Initial plasma zinc was 62.9 +/- 2.1 micrograms/dL. A mean decline in plasma zinc of 4.0 +/- 1.8 micrograms/dL (P less than .05) was observed from baseline to one week. The decline remained statistically significant after adjustment for the expected physiologic decline over the same interval of gestation. No further decline occurred from one to four weeks. No significant treatment-related effects were observed for neutrophil zinc, mononuclear leukocyte zinc, or serum alkaline phosphatase activity. These results indicate that iron therapy in doses typically prescribed by obstetric caregivers in this country has an acute, measurable effect on maternal zinc status.\r"

Unimpeded retroplacental blood flow may depend upon the local inhibition of platelet aggregation.

Placental tissue from patients with abruptio placentae contains abnormally low amounts of this enzyme.\r"

Spontaneous rupture of the membranes occurred earlier and was more likely in the latent phase of labor than was artificial rupture of membranes, which tended to occur nearer to or in the active phase of labor, and at lower pelvic stations. When matched by cervical dilation, spontaneous membrane rupture was associated with more rapid cervical dilation. Stepwise regression analysis confirmed that membrane rupture had a significant but small effect on labor length and rate of cervical dilation. Pelvic station and maternal parity had a smaller association with labor length than did membrane rupture. Cervical dilation at the time of membrane rupture appeared to be the most important factor associated with the length of labor.\r"

The study was performed before and during infusion, and afterward when the patient was on oral drug therapy. Ritodrine therapy increased heart rate, left ventricular fractional shortening, pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio, and cardiac index. A progressive rise in pulmonary capillary pressure was observed in all patients, exceeding 18 mmHg (the threshold for the development of pulmonary congestion) in six patients. Systolic arterial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and plasma protein oncotic pressure remained unchanged during therapy. Ritodrine therapy resulted in a significant drop in diastolic blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance. This noninvasive means of measuring cardiovascular parameters, including pulmonary capillary pressure, may be useful in monitoring patients who develop significant cardiovascular side effects during tocolytic therapy.\r"

Satisfactory recordings were obtained from all patients. The middle cerebral artery waveforms demonstrated a typically biphasic pattern with continuing forward flow in diastole. The peak systolic to end-diastolic ratio (A/B ratio) showed a progressive and significant decline from 6.89 +/- 1.48 at around 25 weeks to 4.23 +/- 0.67 at term. Elevation of diastolic velocities and diminished A/B ratio in the middle cerebral arteries were noted in four fetuses, in whom severe antepartum compromise was diagnosed. The ratio also appeared to decrease with worsening of fetal condition. Because the fetus compensates for hypoxia by increasing blood flow to the brain, Doppler middle cerebral artery waveforms may permit evaluation of fetal compromise and hypoxia.\r"

Based on these observations, patients who exhibited this fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern during NST had labor induced. The purpose of this report was to determine what impact, if any, this approach had on subsequent maternal and fetal outcome. The pregnancy outcome of 470 patients who delivered during 1984 within seven days of their last NST was compared with data from this institution in 1980. The last NST was reactive in 420 patients (89.4%) and nonreactive in 50 (10.6%). Fetal heart rate decelerations occurred in 130 patients (27.7%); of these, 96 (73.9%) were reactive and 34 (26.1%) nonreactive. Postdate patients whose last NST was reactive with decelerations had similar outcomes to patients with a nonreactive NST on their last test, but less favorable outcomes than patients with reactive tests alone. Comparison with data from our institution in 1980 shows that prompt induction of labor in the postdate patient with a reactive NST and decelerations resulted in significantly lower perinatal morbidity, with no corresponding increase in maternal morbidity. These results lead us to conclude that a reactive NST without FHR decelerations is a reliable indicator of fetal well-being in the postdate pregnancy. However, in the postdate pregnancy with a reactive NST with FHR decelerations, induction of labor is indicated.\r"

Neither the payment differential between vaginal and cesarean delivery nor previous legal liability were associated with increased cesarean rates for abnormal labor. We conclude that improved ancillary services may lead to lower dystocia-specific cesarean section rates.\r"

Additionally, some eyes were treated with beta irradiation, which did not appear to influence the results. Eyes that had a limbus-based conjunctival flap at reoperation had a more favorable outcome than those having fornix-based flaps.\r"

Healon-treated eyes lost almost 50% fewer endothelial cells and had a smaller increase in corneal thickness than their counterpart eyes treated with BSS. Lens implantation and phacoemulsification procedures caused the greatest endothelial cell loss, while neodymium YAG laser capsulotomy, a less traumatic procedure, minimized this loss.\r"

However, permanent retinal reattachment was achieved with a single operation in only 64% of the eyes successfully operated on (16/25). Thirty-six per cent (9/25 eyes) of the retinal detachments that were eventually successfully operated on showed clinical evidence of gradual contraction of the vitreous base in the postoperative course, and required 2 or more operations. Experimental studies on standardized models are required to determine whether destruction of the fibrous ingrowth remnants with heavy cryo is of any value in the management of retinal detachment after penetrating scleral wound.\r"

Nineteen percent of boxers had angle abnormalities. Nineteen percent of boxers had pathologic cataracts, over 70% of these were posterior subcapsular. Six boxers had macular lesions. A total of 24% of boxers had retinal tears. Standardized photographs were used to distinguish pathologic cataracts from congenital opacities and pathologic retinal tears from atrophic holes. Attempts were made to identify risk factors in boxing that might be predictive for ocular injury. Variables included age, weight division, left- or right-handedness, total number of losses, and total number of bouts. Significant correlations were found between the total number of bouts and the total number of losses, and the presence of retinal tears. College varsity athletes were selected as controls. Significant differences were found between boxers and controls for the total number of injuries, total vision-threatening injuries, and the number of retinal tears.

ROP developed in 119 (55.6%) infants and, of these, cicatricial ROP developed in nine (7.6%). The disease was diagnosed at 8-9 weeks on the average in infants with birthweights less than 900 g and 4-5 weeks in infants 900 to 1300 g. Those infants in whom the disease regressed, ROP lasted approximately 15 weeks. The severity of the disease, as defined by the SI, was strongly correlated with the birthweight of the infant and weakly correlated with the total duration of oxygen therapy.\r"

Two hundred ninety-six infants were randomly assigned to either a constantly monitored (CM) or standard care (SC) group. CM infants had tcPO2 monitored continuously as long as they required supplemental oxygen, whereas SC infants had tcPO2 monitored only during the more acute state of their illness. Management of both groups was otherwise identical. One hundred one of 148 infants in the CM group and 113 of 148 in the SC group survived. The overall incidence of ROP was 51% in the CM group and 59% in the SC group (no significant difference). In infants over 1000 g birthweight, as the weight increased there was increasing risk of developing ROP in the SC group. The odds ratio for the ROPsc:ROPcm reached 7.6 in infants between 1200 and 1300 g in infants with Apgar scores greater than or equal to 8 at 5 minutes. The incidence of cicatricial ROP was similar in both groups: four in the CM and five in the SC group.\r"

Assessments were made with the acuity cards by two different observers, both blind to the infant's diagnosis, and by a third observer using a traditional forced-choice preferential looking (FPL) procedure. One hundred percent of the infant patients completed both binocular and monocular acuity card testing in an average time of 8 minutes per test. Interobserver agreement between acuity card observers and inter-technique agreement were high, and were sustained in individual cases in which the infant's acuity was not predictable from its visible signs. These results help to establish the potential clinical utility of the acuity card procedure for the assessment of infant patients.\r"

Soft tissue surgery without prosthetic implants or exoplants provided 60% success after a 3-year follow-up. Eyelid elevation or tightening coupled with surgery for facial reanimation produced a higher rate of success at 3 years (83%). An overwhelming number of patients (62%) complained of some degree of epiphora after any or all procedures. Based on these findings, soft tissue surgery without prosthetic implants or exoplants has a higher rate of success.\r"

Persistent diplopia is a common indication for repair of such fractures.

In these patients, an insidious and painless onset of exophthalmos was overshadowed by ptosis or a motility disturbance (particularly limited upgaze) in the absence of chemosis and lid erythema. The lesions were located in the superior rectus-levator complex (6 cases) and in the medial rectus muscle (1 case). One patient, with an exclusive infiltration of the levator, had a complete ptosis, whereas four others had a partial ptosis. Important clinical clues included palpable masses (4 cases) and preserved downward gaze (all cases), the latter suggesting the absence of fibrotic restriction, as is often seen in Graves' myopathy and the idiopathic myositis of pseudotumor. The biopsy specimens showed spill-over of the hypercellular and stroma-free lymphoid tissue into the orbital fat (all cases) and into the lacrimal gland (3 cases). Full extraocular motility on upgaze was restored after local orbital radiotherapy, although a residual ptosis persisted in five cases. Five patients had well-differentiated lesions and nonocular disease did not develop, whereas a widespread disease developed in one of two patients with a cytologically malignant lymphoma; the patient eventually died.\r"

In 572 eyes, the success rate of initial probing was found to be 97% under 13 months of age. Over 13 months, however, the mean success rate was found to be 54.7%. When broken down into smaller age categories, a stepwise progression was observed from 76.4% between 13 and 18 months to 33.3% for patients probed after 24 months. In addition, the number and complexity of subsequent procedures appeared to increase along with the age at which the initial probing was performed. These data suggest that initial probing should be done prior to 13 months of age depending on the severity of symptoms and parent compliance with medical management.\r"

Because of the questions raised about the risk-to-benefit ratio of endarterectomy, patients with ocular manifestations of cerebral ischemia should be considered for this operation only as part of a proposed randomized collaborative study.\r"

This prospective birth defects study collected information from 32,870 women about alcohol consumption during the first trimester of pregnancy. Total malformation rates were not significantly higher among offspring of women who had an average of less than one drink per day (77.3/1,000) or one to two drinks per day (83.2/1,000) than among nondrinkers (78.1/1,000). An increased risk as small as 12% in the group averaging less than one drink per day and 45% in those averaging one to two drinks per day would most likely have been detected if it were present. Likewise, major malformations were not increased in these drinking groups. Examining malformations by organ system and individual defect revealed that sex organ malformations and all genitourinary malformations increased significantly (P less than .05) with increasing alcohol consumption. These findings suggest that alcohol, at the levels usually consumed during pregnancy, is not a significant cause of malformations. Nonetheless, the possibility that there are some malformations for which no safe drinking level exists requires additional investigation.\r"

To evaluate the validity of this premise, we prospectively studied the temperature response to acetaminophen of febrile children who came to an urban pediatric emergency and walk-in facility. The study group consisted of 1,559 patients between the ages of 8 weeks and 6 years whose temperatures when seen were greater than 38.4 degrees C and who had not received antipyretic treatment within the previous four hours. Acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) was administered to each child and repeat temperatures were taken one and two hours later. Patient management was unaffected by the study, and physicians were unaware of the repeat temperature measurements. Telephone follow-up was conducted with the parents of each child within five days of the initial visit. Children with cultures positive for bacterial disease or chest x-ray films positive for pneumonia had slightly greater one- and two-hour temperature decreases compared with children with other diagnoses. Although statistically significant, we do not consider these differences in response to be clinically useful. We conclude that fever response to acetaminophen is not a clinically useful indicator by which to differentiate the causes of febrile illnesses in young children.\r"

A decline in prevalence of anemia was observed during that period. The overall age-adjusted rate of anemia decreased from 6.2% in 1969 to 1973, 5.8% in 1974 to 1977, 3.8% in 1978 to 1981, and 2.7% in 1982 to 1986. The decline was also observed when trends were determined for three age groups using a single hematocrit measurement per child. The 1982 to 1986 prevalences of anemia for various age groups among this middle-class pediatric population were relatively low: 2.8% among 9- to 23-month-old children, 2.4% among 24- to 47-month-old children, and 2.7% among 48- to 83-month-old children. Most of these recent cases of anemia were mild--most were only slightly less than the hematocrit values used to define anemia--and most did not show strong evidence of iron deficiency based on elevated levels of erythrocyte protoporphyrin. We conclude that iron deficiency is now mild and uncommon in these middle-class children. This improved nutritional status with regard to iron is probably related to increased intake of iron among infants and young children during the past two decades. These findings suggest that the recommended screening schedule for iron deficiency with hemoglobin or hematocrit measurements may need to be reassessed for well-defined populations of low-risk children.\r"

  ".W": "After almost a century of improvement, the rate of decrease in US infant mortality rates began to level off during the period of 1982 to 1984. Rates actually increased in some states. Because much of the decline in infant mortality in this century can be attributed to advances in infectious disease treatment and prevention programs, we evaluated the current impact of infectious diseases on infant mortality. The National Center for Health Statistics mortality data for 1980 contains information on as many as 20 causes of death for a given individual. Using these data, we found that infectious diseases contributed to 12.5% of all infant deaths and to almost 400,000 years of potential life lost because of infant deaths. Infectious diseases contributed to 9% of deaths of low birth weight infants and to more than 18% of all deaths in the postneonatal period. Compared with white infants, a higher proportion of nonwhite infants died of causes related to infectious diseases. For black infants, the mortality rate related to infectious diseases was twice that for white infants. These data indicate that infectious diseases still are a major contributor to infant mortality, one of the 15 areas targeted for prevention by the federal government, and the data suggest that programs for reducing infant mortality should place increased emphasis on preventing infectious diseases.\r"

  ".W": "We used a resident continuity clinic to compare prospectively the impact of salary v fee-for-service reimbursement on physician practice behavior. This model allowed randomization of physicians into salary and fee-for-service groups and separation of the effects of reimbursement from patient behavior. Physicians reimbursed by fee-for-services scheduled more visits per patient than did salaried physicians (3.69 visits v 2.83 visits, P less than .01) and saw their patients more often (2.70 visits v 2.21 visits, P less than .05) during the 9-month study. Almost all of this difference was because fee-for-service physicians saw more well patients than salaried physicians (1.42 visits and .99 visits per enrolled patient, respectively, P less than .01). Evaluating visits by American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines indicated that fee-for-service physicians saw more patients for well-childcare than salaried physicians because they missed fewer recommended visits and scheduled visits in excess of those recommendations. Fee-for-service physicians also provided better continuity of care than salaried physicians by attending a larger percentage of all visits made by their patients (86.6% of visits v 78.3% of visits, P less than .05), and by encouraging fewer emergency visits per enrolled patient (0.12 visits v 0.22 visits, P less than .01). Physicians' interest in private practice, as determined by their career plans, correlated significantly with total number of patients enrolled (r = .48, P less than .05) and total clinic patients seen by each resident during the study (r = .40, P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seventy-three infants, born to families who had two or more previous siblings who had either died of SIDS or who were monitored at home for apnea of infancy or for abnormal results on polysomnogram and/or pneumogram recording, were prospectively monitored. The infants underwent polysomnogram and pneumogram recordings and were subsequently monitored at home with a cardiorespiratory monitor. All episodes of apnea were immediately reviewed. Thirteen infants (18%) had subsequent severe episodes of apnea and five other infants (7%) died during a subsequent episode. All deaths occurred in families who had two or more SIDS victims. The outcome for the 17 infants who were half siblings was similar to the outcome for full siblings. Clinical data of the infants and results of evaluation were not predictive of outcome.\r"

  ".W": "For many inner-city families, the emergency clinic is the most frequent and sometimes the only point of contact with medical services. We hypothesized that this setting could serve as an opportunity to direct a health promotion at a population that might not receive such a message elsewhere. The objectives of the program were (1) to remind parents of the telephone number of the Massachusetts Poison Center, (2) to ensure that parents have ipecac for use in an emergency, and (3) to counsel parents on how to use ipecac. Of 403 families recruited from the emergency clinic and divided randomly into intervention and nonintervention groups, 262 families completed the follow-up interview 6 months later (65%). Results showed that 68% of intervention families compared with 42% of control families reported ipecac storage at follow-up (chi 2 = 7.65, P = .005) and that 40% of intervention families v 25% of control families reported familiarity with the use of ipecac (chi 2 = 4.04, P = .04). Accessibility to the poison center's telephone number was reported by 62% of intervention families and by 49% of control families (chi 2 = 4.60, P = .13). Finally, 42% of intervention families v 25% of control families reported that they had a sticker on their phone with the number of the poison center on it (chi 2 = 4.60, P = .03). Our results suggest that a brief intervention, even in an emergency clinic, can introduce the topic of poisoning prevention to families and can encourage the storage of syrup of ipecac in the home.\r"

  ".W": "Syrup of ipecac is widely used following accidental drug overdosage in children. Proof of its efficacy, however, in reducing the risk of poisoning is limited. We prospectively studied the effect of early v late induction of emesis by ipecac in 50 children younger than 5 years of age with accidental acetaminophen poisoning. The mean estimated ingested dose was 165 mg/kg, and all patients vomited within 15 to 255 (mean 78) minutes postingestion. Although the predicted four-hour plasma acetaminophen concentration was 97 +/- 4 micrograms/mL (mean +/- SEM, calculated on the basis of the estimated ingested dose), the measured four-hour plasma acetaminophen concentration was 34 +/- 5 micrograms/mL (P less than .01). To assess the efficacy of early v late ipecac-induced emesis, we used the ratio of measured to predicted four-hour acetaminophen plasma concentration. The ratio of the measured to predicted four-hour level increased as the delay in time to vomiting increased (r = .60, P less than .001). Ipecac syrup was administered more promptly when available in the home than when obtained from a pharmacy or a medical facility (26 +/- 8 v 83 +/- 13 minutes postingestion, respectively; P less than .001) and vomiting occurred earlier (49 +/- 9 v 103 +/- 12 minutes postingestion; P less than .01). Although the mean estimated doses ingested were greater in patients who received ipecac syrup at home, their four-hour plasma acetaminophen concentrations were lower. These data suggest that prompt administration of ipecac syrup results in a greater reduction in plasma acetaminophen concentrations in potentially toxic overdosages in children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Acute rheumatic fever is reported to have declined and perhaps be vanishing. Prompted by the occurrence of 17 cases of acute rheumatic fever in an 18-month period in 1985 and 1986, we reviewed the records of 243 children with acute rheumatic fever who were cared for at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh or Mercy Hospital between 1965 and 1986. Acute rheumatic fever was diagnosed using the modified Jones criteria and cases were classified by major criteria as arthritis, arthritis and carditis, carditis alone, carditis and chorea, chorea alone, and arthritis and chorea. Among the 17 recent patients, 59% had carditis, 30% had chorea, and 24% had arthritis alone. The proportion of children who had particular major manifestations was similar in the last two decades and in 1985 to 1986. The recent children with acute rheumatic fever ranged in age from 6 to 13 years with a mean and median age of 10 years. There were 16 white children and one Asian child. Only four children lived in an urban setting. When demographic features of the children were contrasted with those in the previous two decades, a decrease in the proportion of children who lived in urban areas and who were black was noted. Four children had a history of preceding sore throat but only three sought medical care; nine children had no memorable illness and four had either a nonrespiratory illness or a respiratory infection without sore throat. This resurgence of rheumatic fever serves as a reminder that a diligent approach to the diagnosis and therapy of streptococcal infections remains essential.\r"

During the neonatal period, the patients had prolonged apneas and hypoventilation, in the absence of cardiac, pulmonary, or neuromuscular disease. After an initial period of respirator dependency, they became able to sustain normal gas exchange while awake. During sleep, however, profound hypoventilation developed, and tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation were required. Ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia were depressed or absent and did not improve with time. One patient was able, at 2 years of age, to breathe spontaneously during sleep with only moderate hypoventilation. The others, now 4 to 14 years of age, still need ventilatory support during sleep. Complications, such as cardiac failure and hypoxic seizures, mostly occurred early in the course and resolved with correction of insufficient mechanical ventilation. Speech acquisition was possible with the use of a special stoma plug. All patients were managed at home, and with appropriate support, the parents were able to provide safe ventilatory care with low morbidity and no mortality.\r"

The evolution of the infarct could be followed on serial CT scans. No predisposing factors during pregnancy or delivery were found, and serious neurologic deficits developed in both children. These cases demonstrate that, even in full-term neonates with discrete or moderate neurologic symptoms and born after normal pregnancy and delivery, the possibility of vasoocclusive brain infarction should be considered. The diagnosis is suggested by imaging techniques, of which CT scanning seems to have the greatest value at present. This technique also permits the follow-up of the lesions. The prognosis for neurologic development appears to be variable: minor neurologic deficits as well as unexplained spastic hemiplegia in older children may be the consequence of inapparent cerebral arterial infarction in the neonatal period.\r"

The procedures were performed since 1980 on an emergent or urgent basis in 30 infants and children by an experienced interventional neuroradiologist in Bicetre, France. Indications for embolization included hemorrhage, occular occlusion, respiratory obstruction, CNS complications or potential complications, interference with nutrition, and functional impairment related to the effect of the lesion on the developing facial skeleton and teeth. The specific lesions included seven hemangiomas (palpebral, subglottic, and nasal) and 20 vascular malformations (maxillofacial, auricular, dural, cerebral [including three vein of Galen malformations] and spinomedullary). Embolization was efficacious in 28 of 30 patients. Hemangiomas (potentially involutive tumors) responded dramatically with arrest of the proliferative phase and shrinking of the mass. Combined hemovascular lymphatic malformations (hemolymphangiomas) of the tongue demonstrated a variable decrease in size. High-flow evolutive arteriovenous malformations involving the teeth and dura were controlled but required multiple embolizations. One infant with a vein of Galen arteriovenous malformation died. Three local complications occurred in two patients. No cerebral ischemic or femoral artery complications occurred.\r"

These results are compared with those obtained, under the same experimental conditions, in a group exposed to commercial green lamps. Similar bilirubin decline rates were observed in the two experiments. In general, these data confirm the satisfactory clinical efficacy of the green light in phototherapy and prove, in particular, that the blue component present in the emission spectrum of the commercial green lamps has a negligible effect on the bilirubin degradation process.\r"

  ".W": "A project to overcome institutional constraints to breast-feeding was implemented in a large municipal hospital. Interventions included staff education, intensive training of a team of physicians and nurses, development of user-tested educational materials, and day and evening staffing by a breast-feeding counselor. A nearby hospital served as a control. Project evaluation entailed chart reviews at the intervention site and a control hospital (n = 812); interviews with mothers during their postpartum hospital stay and at return clinic visits (n = 180); and field observations in all areas of the hospital that provided prenatal, intrapartum, postpartum, and pediatric care. Comparisons of the incidence and pattern of breast-feeding were made before, midway through, and after the project. At the intervention site, the incidence of breast-feeding increased from 15% to 56%, and exclusive breast-feeding for more than 3/4 of feedings increased from 0% to 15%. At the control site, the respective changes were from 28% to 41% and from 5% to 7%. Formula use by breast-feeding women decreased but was nonetheless extensive, and the usual reason given by breast-feeding women for supplementation was a perceived insufficiency of breast milk. This may be due, in part, to the fact that bedside assistance to breast-feeding mothers was not integrated into the routine care provided by staff nurses but was relegated to the lactation nurse/counselors who were not available at all times. It is concluded that the process to overcome institutional constraints to breast-feeding is difficult but feasible. Repeated and extensive professional education helps create the context whereby clinical and administrative staff can reassess routines and policies.\r"

We studied the difference in gastroduodenal motility between neonates fed with human milk and those fed with infant formula. Twenty-four five- to 36-day-old neonates were fed with mother's breast milk or with a cow's milk-based formula. Postprandial gastroduodenal contractions were recorded manometrically for three hours. Repetitive, high-amplitude nonmigrating contractions were the dominant wave form during the postprandial period. The number of episodes, duration, amplitude, and frequency of nonmigrating contractions were not different following the different feedings. The migrating myoelectric complex, which signals a return to the interdigestive (fasting) state, appeared in 75% of breast milk-fed infants but only 17% of formula-fed infants (P less than .05) within the three-hour recording period. Because contractions were similar following the two meals, but a fasting state recurred more rapidly in breast-fed infants, we conclude that factors other than phasic, nonpropagated antroduodenal contractions were responsible for the differences in gastric emptying between breast milk and formula.\r"

Diagnosis is aided if the patient can reliably identify the insect, and more specific diagnosis depends on venom skin testing for individual sensitivity. Radioallergosorbent testing is also used but fails to identify about 15% to 20% of sensitivities. Avoidance of high-risk situations is the best approach for patients with known sensitivity. Treatment includes relief of local symptomatic reactions, pharmacologic arrest of anaphylaxis, and venom immunotherapy.\r"

The recent resurgence in physical fitness awareness has only exacerbated the problem, and the physician needs to acknowledge the potential for abuse in any athlete. Despite the difficulties and ethical problems in designing good controlled studies with high-dose steroids, evidence suggests that steroids do increase muscular strength in certain subgroups of athletes. Unfortunately, numerous side effects and permanent damage may occur, and the athlete may be at risk for the development of fatal liver tumors or cardiovascular disease.\r"

Rabies is almost always transmitted by a bite; licks and other nonbite exposures hardly ever cause the disease. The control of rabies in domestic animals has greatly reduced the risk of human disease following the bite of a dog or cat, but rabies in wild animals (especially skunks and raccoons) remains a constant threat. By obtaining epidemiologic information about animal rabies in the area where the exposure occurred, the physician can determine whether the animal in question may have been rabid. If any question remains, owned dogs and cats should be observed for ten days and any other animal should be killed and its brain examined for rabies virus. When postexposure prophylaxis is indicated, it should be administered exactly as recommended herein.\r"

Although hematuria may be caused by coagulopathy, patients with anticoagulant-induced hematuria must be examined for anatomic defects. Hematuria may originate from the kidney or the urinary tract; red cell casts and dysmorphic red cells suggest a renal source. Hematuria arising from the kidney is classified as glomerular (eg, various forms of glomerulonephritis) or nonglomerular (eg, polycystic kidney disease, cancer). If the urine is pigmented but test strips are negative, or test strips are negative but no red cells are seen, pseudohematuria must be considered.\r"

The starting date for the pill can be up to the sixth day of the cycle. Noncontraceptive benefits of the pill may include a protective effect against endometrial and ovarian malignancy, benign breast disease, and infection of the upper genital tract.

Nineteen healthy subjects (8 men, 11 women) participated in this study. Each subject performed squat lifts both with the lumbar spine aligned in \"back-bowed-in\" (BBI), or normal, lordosis and with the lumbar spine aligned in \"back-bowed-out\" (BBO), or relatively less, lordosis. Based on total duration, the lift was divided into two equal phases. Electromyographic activity of each muscle was quantified for each half of the lift and normalized to the total EMG produced by the muscle during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction. A three-way analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to analyze the effects of position of the lumbar spine, timing, and load on the amount of EMG activity during lifting. For all loads, ES muscle activity was greater during the first half of the BBI lift, whereas OA muscle activity was greater during the first half of the lift, regardless of the lifting style (p less than .01). The greater ES and OA muscle activity occurring during the crucial initial period in the BBI lift may provide the best protection for the lumbar spine.\r"

We found no significant difference in step width nor in the percentage of time spent in each phase of the gait cycle. The anterior pelvic tilt of subjects with JRA was significantly increased throughout the gait cycle. Hip extension at the end of single-limb stance and ankle plantar flexion during weight release also were significantly decreased for subjects with JRA. No significant difference between the two groups was noted in knee joint excursion. Areas of emphasis for physical therapy of patients with JRA include increasing velocity, cadence, stride length, hip extension, and ankle plantar flexion and decreasing excessive anterior pelvic tilt.\r"

They often use manual muscle testing or hand-held dynametric muscle testing (DMT), but few studies document the reliability of MMT or compare the reliability of the two types of testing. We designed this study to determine the intrarater reliability of MMT and DMT. A physical therapist performed manual and dynametric strength tests of the same five muscle groups on 11 patients and then repeated the tests two days later. The correlation coefficients were high and significantly different from zero for four muscle groups tested dynametrically and for two muscle groups tested manually. The test-retest reliability coefficients for two muscle groups tested manually could not be calculated because the values between subjects were identical. We concluded that both MMT and DMT are reliable testing methods, given the conditions described in this study. Both testing methods have specific applications and limitations, which we discuss.\r"

This technique provided continuous information about the mechanical energy costs of the whole body and each of its parts, the energy types involved, and the amounts of energy conserved. In most cases, the energy costs were above normal and were attributable to poor patterns of exchange between the potential and kinetic energy types of the head, arms, and trunk segment; to very low levels of kinetic energy that precluded exchange; or to both. We concluded that attention should be directed to restoring the sinusoidal pattern of motion and to the fluctuating speeds during each gait cycle when energy costs are a therapeutic consideration.\r"

A linear regression analysis of VO2 (L/min) as a function of velocity (m/sec) revealed a slope and correlation coefficient of 0.614 and .93, respectively, for the conventional chair, and 0.510 and .96, respectively, for the sports chair. The intercepts of these relationships did not differ between wheelchair designs. The data analysis revealed no difference between chair designs in the relationship between velocity and work rate. Thus, the energy cost of propelling the sports chair at a specific velocity was 17% less than that of the conventional chair. The greater efficiency of the sports chair is attributed to differences in wheelchair design, rather than to the total mass of the device.\r"

The effects of these low intensity exercise programs are not stated clearly in the literature. In this single-case experimental study, we investigated the effects of a training program of isometric exercise of at least two thirds of maximum voluntary contraction on the knee joint and surrounding muscles of a patient with hemophilia. A 12-year-old subject with severe factor-VIII deficiency and chronic knee arthroses was seen for baseline measurements, three weeks of treatment, and follow-up baseline measurements. The isometric exercise program safely increased right hamstring and quadriceps femoris muscle group strength 40% to 70% without adversely affecting knee range of motion, circumference, or skin temperature and without causing bleeding or discomfort. The use of isometric exercise programs during rehabilitation and maintenance is a promising treatment component for the total care of the individual with hemophilia.\r"

Six healthy male subjects cycled at different work loads, pedaling rates, saddle heights, and pedal foot positions. The maximum patellofemoral compressive force was 905 N (1.3 times body weight [BW]) when cycling with an anterior foot position at 120 W, 60 rpm, and middle saddle height. The mean peak compressive force between the quadriceps tendon and the intercondylar groove was 295 N (0.4 BW), and the patellar-tendon and quadriceps-tendon strain forces were 661 N (0.9 BW) and 938 N (1.3 BW), respectively. The patellofemoral joint forces were increased with increased work load or decreased saddle height. Different pedaling rates or foot positions did not significantly change these forces.\r"

The physical therapy director's professional values of commitment to high standards of patient care, professional growth, and self-discipline are presented, in addition to specific methods of conveying these values to others. These specific methods include providing a clear focus for the department, being active in patient care, and providing specific mechanisms to allow professional growth of staff members in a directed, but flexible, environment. Our contention is that these dual roles are required to maximize fiscal productivity and professional growth of the staff.\r"

Fifteen implants (8.5 percent) in 12 patients (11.3 percent) were either removed or repositioned. In those having augmentation for entirely aesthetic reasons, 3 of 60 patients (5.0 percent) required implant removal or repositioning. The incidence of needing to remove or reposition implants has decreased as the technique has evolved.\r"

Medial displacement of the internal carotid arteries inhibits surgical treatment of velopharyngeal insufficiency, necessitating treatment with a prosthetic speech device in such children. Since displacement and tortuosity may be associated findings in the velocardiofacial syndrome, the exact location of the internal carotids should be ascertained when pharyngeal flap surgery is planned.\r"

The women's perceptions of these areas before and after surgery were obtained retrospectively (between 3 months and 3 years after surgery). The 54 women in consistent relationships reported positive effects of the surgery on their relationship, although not to the extent that they had anticipated. However, regardless of this finding, these women perceived surgery to have had significant positive effects on their attractiveness, as well as on their body and self-image. Postoperatively, the partners of these women were viewed as having a significantly greater interest in sexual activity, as perceiving the women to be significantly more attractive, and as believing that the sexual relationship was significantly enhanced. The 21 women who were not in a consistent relationship also reported positive postoperative changes, although these were not statistically significant. Neither the women's age, length of time since surgery, nor the duration of the woman's relationship had any effect on the positive changes reported. The quantitative and qualitative data underscored the highly positive benefits of breast augmentation for the respondents.\r"

Previous attempts using suction lipectomy for gynecomastia still required the use of sharp dissection for removal of the glandular breast tissue as well as excision of redundant skin. With this new technique, gynecomastia is corrected solely with the use of suction lipectomy. The technique is successful if the gynecomastia is due to excess fat or parenchymal hypertrophy. A 7-mm cannula is inserted first, to remove the adipose tissue. Then a 2.4-mm cannula is used to remove the glandular and ductal tissue. The 7-mm cannula is then reinserted to remove subareolar parenchyma and to make final contour adjustments. The surrounding subcutaneous tissue is easily undermined to avoid a saucer deformity and to allow for skin contraction. Patients return to full activities in 48 hours. A compressive garment is worn for 4 to 6 weeks. The results of 10 patients are discussed.\r"

We describe a technique for simultaneous subcutaneous mastectomy and retropectoral implantation of a silicone prosthesis. Gentle blunt prepectoral, retromammary dissection is performed through an axillary incision as far inferiorly as the inframammary fold, where a fibrous bridge between the anterior surface of the pectoralis major muscle and the skin prevents dissection any lower. Through the same incision, the retropectoral space is dissected to about 5 cm below the inframammary fold. A second incision is made in the inframammary fold to join the retromammary plane of the first dissection. The gland is then dissected subcutaneously and removed through the inframammary incision. A silicone implant is introduced retropectorally through the axillary incision, thus avoiding splitting the pectoralis major. Satisfactory results have been obtained in 23 bilateral and 14 unilateral cases; it is important that the dissection be performed carefully in order to prevent the implant from riding up too high in its musculoaponeurotic sling.\r"

Nineteen patients were female and 35 were male. Most recently, in patients with high-risk lesions, such as those exhibiting an aggressive vertical growth phase or a Clark level IV or V, attempts at curative resection have utilized wide and deep excision to the level of the pectoralis fascia with axillary lymph node dissection in selected cases. Reconstruction of the significant breast deficit in five female patients utilized the latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap. This technique results in an improved aesthetic appearance when compared to primary closure or skin grafting. Donor-site morbidity is minimal. Long-term cancer surveillance is not impeded, and all five patients expressed satisfaction with the reconstruction. Four of the five female patients are currently alive with no evidence of disease at a mean follow-up of 55 months after definitive therapy.\r"

Of those surveyed, 508 responded (71 percent). Ninety-eight of the 508 respondents reported an infection (19.29 percent). The rate of infection was found to correlate positively with the number of patients seen per week. The rate of infection was increased in respondents with chronic disease (e.g., diabetes mellitus) versus those without chronic disease (33.33 vs. 18.59 percent). In the dental professionals surveyed, it was found that the rate of infection in those who did not routinely wear surgical gloves was significantly greater than in those who did (28.6 vs. 17.6 percent). The morbidity of infections acquired in dental practice can be substantial. A percentage of individuals must leave their practice for surgical treatment. A number have acquired hepatitis B (although none in this study), and exposure to the HTLV-III is possible. We conclude that some protection from infection can be achieved with the routine use of surgical gloves, and this practice should be considered by all, particularly those with chronic disease.\r"

Vessels with an anastomosis outside the area of infection had a similar thrombosis rate, but if the anastomotic site was within the infected area itself, the thrombosis rate increased to 75 percent. Inflammatory changes with subsequent fibrosis in the media and adventitia appeared responsible for the thrombosis. The intima was unaffected by the presence of infection. This study suggests that when a microvascular anastomosis is necessary in the presence of infection, the anastomosis should be placed outside the area of infection with a pedicle to traverse the infected area.\r"

Although the deformity was severe, a satisfactory cosmetic result was obtained and there have been no clinically significant sequelae during a 1-year follow-up period. The degree of bony deformation was most likely enhanced by the combination of this patient's severe osteoporosis, chronic steroid use, and peripheral vascular disease. The fragility and ease of fracture in the bones of osteoporotic postmenopausal females and the long-term effects of steroids on tissues is well known. We believe this observation to be important, since many reconstructed patients are postmenopausal and have variable degrees of osteoporosis. Many undergo adjuvant chemotherapy with steroids and antihormonal agents, and this group of women may therefore be at a greater risk for the occurrence of pressure deformities. The incidence and long-term significance of such deformities are not known. The reconstructive surgeon should be alert to the possibility of this phenomenon occurring as a result of tissue expansion in the patient with severe osteoporosis, peripheral vascular disease, or chronic steroid use.\r"

Full-thickness skin graft or flap coverage of nail bed defects resulted in the good nail bed regeneration. The nail bed grew back, pushing the graft or the flap distally. The regenerated nail beds were about 70 percent of normal size in guillotine-type amputations and about 90 percent in the presence of an intact distal phalanx. The difference between full- and split-thickness skin grafts seemed to be adherence to the phalangeal bone, the former giving way to the advancing nail bed and the latter staying in the way. In addition, the destination of the moving nail bed cells was discussed.\r"

The policies were evaluated by comparison with the pre-policy period and between policies. The policies were applied successfully and both were associated with a fall in the proportion of trimethoprim-resistant faecal coliforms and urinary isolates. Policy 1 appeared to affect plasmid-mediated resistance to a greater extent than policy 2. There were no differences in outcome for patients during policy periods. Control of antibiotic usage by formal policies is a viable means of controlling bacterial resistance in geriatric wards. The mode of action of such policies requires further elucidation.\r"

Twenty-nine patients had histological evidence of underlying cirrhosis and these patients were predominantly male (25/29) and elderly (mean age 66 years). Serological evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was found in 11 (38 per cent) of the cirrhotic group. Of the 25 males with cirrhosis, 13 (52 per cent) were known to have seen military service in the tropics and of these eight had serum HBV markers. The non-cirrhotic group was younger (mean age 55 years) and the sex distribution was nearly equal (six male, five female). Two patients (19 per cent) had hepatitis B markers including one of the two men in this group who had served in the tropics. One patient with no serum HBV markers had integrated HBV-DNA sequences in the cellular DNA of her tumour. These observations confirm the association of primary hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatitis B virus and suggest that a significant proportion of patients of United Kingdom origin acquired their susceptibility as a result of military service in the tropics. There is presumably a substantial cohort of ex-service men at risk of developing primary hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

These measurements were repeated on a second occasion following the ingestion of 400 ml of an isotonic lactulose solution. Superior mesenteric artery blood flow increased by 53 per cent (p less than 0.05) 5 min after the end of ingestion of the glucose solution. The increase persisted at 10 min and declined to 47 per cent at 15 min and to 23 per cent at 30 min. No significant change in blood flow was found following the ingestion of the lactulose solution. Significant differences between the two responses were found at 5, 10 and 15 min (p less than 0.05). The increase in blood flow after a glucose solution and not after lactulose suggests therefore that the process of absorption is an important factor governing postprandial superior mesenteric artery blood flow.\r"

Fourteen patients receive an initial dose of 40 mg/day of prednisolone, followed by gradual reduction of the dose over an average period of about 19 months. After discontinuation of corticosteroids, they were treated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and/or anti-thrombocyte drugs to the end of the study. Another 29 patients received non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and/or anti-thrombocyte drugs throughout the study. Fourteen patients treated with steroids experienced considerable reduction in proteinuria and maintained renal function over 81 months. In 29 patients treated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and/or anti-thrombocyte drugs alone, proteinuria did not decrease and renal function deteriorated significantly during 60 months. At the end of the study, differences in degree of proteinuria and in levels of renal function between the steroid and non-steroid groups were statistically significant. In addition, these differences became more distinct in patients with initial creatinine clearance values 70 ml/min or more in both groups. These results suggest that treatment with steroids in IgA nephropathy may be beneficial, especially in the early stage of the disease.\r"

We found no patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were long-term anticonvulsant users and only one who used oral contraceptives. However, we observed a four-fold excess of diabetic patients among the group with hepatocellular carcinoma. This association did not appear to be due to pre-existing haemochromatosis, alcoholic cirrhosis or viral hepatitis. The association was strongest in patients receiving drug treatment for diabetes, but the data, although suggestive, were insufficient to determine whether any specific anti-diabetic agent could be responsible. Further studies are required to elucidate the nature of this unexpected association. An association of this magnitude with diabetes mellitus could account at least in part for the increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in western Europe.\r"

Heart rate variability was measured by a computerised technique during rest and in response to a single deep breath, the Valsalva manoeuvre and standing. Changes in heart rate were compared with age-related normal ranges derived from 310 non-diabetic control subjects aged 18 to 87 years. Heart rate responses were found to be below the 5th centile control value in 13 to 23 per cent of diabetics. Impaired heart rate variability occurred more frequently in response to a single deep breath than to the other procedures. Results from all four procedures were combined in each subject to give an 'autonomic score', varying from 0 to 4. This score was greater than 1 in only five of 310 (1.6 per cent) non-diabetic control subjects. A score of 2 or more was therefore defined as abnormal and indicative of cardiac autonomic denervation. Abnormal autonomic scores were found in 84 diabetics (16.6 per cent). In diabetic subjects the autonomic score correlated most closely with heart rate variability at rest and in response to a single deep breath. Abnormal autonomic scores correlated significantly with duration of diabetes (p less than 0.0001) but not with age (p = 0.06). The frequency of abnormal autonomic scores was greatest in diabetics aged 40 to 49 years (24.5 per cent) and those with diabetes of 20 or more years duration (30.7 per cent).\r"

The more frequent employment of breast-sparing surgical procedures and the encouraging survival rates in patients detected and treated for these early lesions represents an important contribution to the care of these women. Improvement in the detection of early breast cancer can be achieved by community radiologists, whether in private hospitals or office-based practices.\r"

The UK group had a lower frequency of systemic thrombolytic effect and of bleeding complications. SK antibody titers were measured in all patients who received infusions. Patients with high titers who were treated with SK responded poorly (20% lysis); patients with low titers responded at a rate equal to that of UK-treated patients. Three patients with high titers of SK antibodies did not respond to SK, but subsequent successful lysis did occur with UK. In conclusion, UK is believed to be preferable to SK for local thrombolytic therapy due to increased efficacy of lysis and decreased rate of systemic fibrinolytic effect and bleeding complications.\r"

Cardiac masses were confirmed in 15 patients on the basis of MR imaging results. In seven patients, MR imaging confirmed the absence of an intracardiac mass but demonstrated an anatomic variant or other abnormality that had been interpreted as a possible mass on the echocardiogram. In 12 patients, MR demonstrated neither an intracardiac mass nor an anatomic variant that was likely to have been misinterpreted as a mass on the echocardiogram. Clinical follow-up in these patients at 10 months to 2 years and repeat 2D echocardiography have not indicated a definite mass. In six patients tissue characterization of the mass with MR imaging added some specificity to the MR diagnosis. Thus, MR imaging can be used to verify intracardiac masses found on 2D echocardiograms and to exclude a mass as the cause of equivocal findings on 2D echocardiography.\r"

  ".W": "The authors describe the computed tomographic (CT) appearances of aspergilloma in 26 patients. With narrow (3-mm) sections, a bone algorithm, and wide window settings, CT scans enabled accurate identification of both the forming aspergilloma as well as the mature fungus ball in 25 cases. The diagnostic accuracy of CT was confirmed histologically in nine cases. The radiologic concept of the aspergilloma as a solid mass partially surrounded by a crescent of air is no longer tenable as the only definite criterion for diagnosis. In cases in which this classic appearance is seen on CT scans, mobility is easily demonstrated with use of prone and supine positions. In other cases, the aspergilloma appears as an irregular spongework containing air spaces and filling the cavity, obliterating the air crescent sign. The fungus ball is therefore fixed and immobile. Forming aspergillomas can also be identified by the fungal strands that fall into the cavity lumen, trapping air and initiating the sponge-work appearance. The CT appearance in patients with positive precipitins is characteristic and allows earlier diagnosis than does conventional tomography.\r"

The patients were a representative random sample chosen from among 675 patients followed up for more than 10 years. The frequency of occurrence for each radiographic finding was correlated with the duration of rheumatoid arthritis. The six radiographic findings that occurred in 30% or more of patients with a disease duration of less than 10 years included odontoid erosions, subaxial subluxation, superficial apophyseal joint erosions, apophyseal joint sclerosis at levels C-4 through C-7, and diskovertebral joint narrowing and osteophytosis at C-4 through C-7. Familiarity with these early findings in the cervical spine may be helpful in both diagnosing and managing rheumatoid arthritis. Subaxial subluxation and superficial apophyseal joint erosions did not progressively increase in frequency with increasing duration of disease, but the other four features did. Other features that were uncommon in early disease became significantly more frequent in later decades.\r"

Probable abnormal articular cartilage was detected in ten joints, and MR imaging also demonstrated epiphyseal overgrowth, bone erosions, joint effusions, and joint space narrowing. Because MR imaging appears to provide an objective method of evaluating both synovial hypertrophy and status of articular cartilage, it may prove to be useful in monitoring progression of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and response to therapy.\r"

Most radiologic methods for staging RA lack interobserver correlation and are time consuming. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides excellent depiction of soft-tissue abnormalities of the joints affected by RA, which allows detection of early changes. Nineteen joints of 17 patients with RA were studied with surface-coil MR imaging. Measurable abnormalities demonstrated by MR imaging but not clearly seen on plain radiographs included bone erosions, joint effusion, synovial sheath effusion, and cartilage irregularity and thinning. Seven patients of this group underwent MR imaging before and after 6 months of gold therapy. Four patients had significant interval changes on MR images that were not seen on plain radiographs. MR imaging may become a sensitive and objective method for quantitative assessment of the joint changes of RA.\r"

Cervical radiographs were available for all patients; bone erosion was evident in 14, subluxation in 17, and no abnormalities in one. MR imaging demonstrated indentation or abnormal signal in the caudal brain stem and/or cervical spinal cord in ten patients, including the seven with related neurologic deficits; discrete indentation or distortion of the dura without visible morphologic effect on the underlying neuraxis was observed in five other patients. In all patients with neurologic symptoms, cord or brain-stem abnormalities were seen on MR images. MR imaging therefore appears to provide valuable information regarding the status of the spinal cord and dura in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

To define the basis for these signal characteristics, a retrospective review was done of the MR imaging findings in ten vertebral hemangiomas (eight patients), and these were correlated with the findings from plain radiographic, computed tomographic (CT), and histopathologic studies. MR images showed mottled increased signal in T1- and T2-weighted images from the osseous portions of the tumors. In three patients, the extraosseous components failed to show increased signal on T1-weighted images. Chemical shift images and histologic studies demonstrated that adipose tissue caused the increased signal on T1-weighted images. The extraosseous components of the tumor contained little, if any, adipose tissue, which explained the lack of high-intensity signal on T1-weighted images. These signal changes appear to make a specific constellation of findings for the diagnosis of vertebral hemangioma with MR imaging.\r"

The anatomic configuration of the meniscus as seen with MR correlated directly with normal variations of the anterior recess seen with arthrography. Concavity of the superior aspect of the anterior recess as seen on arthrography was caused by a thick, bulbous anterior band of the meniscus, whereas a flat anterior recess resulted from a thin anterior band without a convex inferior margin. This study emphasizes that the appearance of a concave anterior recess on static arthrograms is not necessarily due to a displaced meniscus.\r"

Other MR findings included an abnormal amount of soft tissue surrounding the disk, thinning of the disk, osteophytes, and erosion of the condyle.

In the blinded reading, CT was superior to MR imaging in eight instances; in the final reading, however, with clinical information available, CT was superior in four cases of inflammatory salivary gland \"masses.\" CT and MR imaging provided the same diagnostic information in all cases of salivary gland neoplasms. T1- and T2-weighted images proved of equal value in detection of salivary gland lesions, and use of both provided no additional specificity. In most cases, T1-weighted images alone provided the information necessary for surgical management. MR imaging is a reasonable first choice if a neoplasm is likely; the potential for improved tissue contrast at the margins of a tumor may be particularly useful. If a mass may be of inflammatory origin, contrast material-enhanced CT is a more reasonable first choice.\r"

Computed tomography (CT) is an excellent modality for evaluation of frontal sinus trauma, particularly for anterior and posterior wall fractures. However, fractures of the nasofrontal duct are more difficult to delineate, and judgments about operating for this problem are often made on less than concrete evidence of duct trauma. To evaluate the usefulness of CT in identifying nasofrontal duct trauma, a two-part study was done. First, CT was performed on cadavers to study the anatomic relationship of the nasofrontal duct to midface anatomy. Then, a retrospective study was performed in 19 patients with suspected frontal sinus fractures who underwent frontal sinus surgery. Findings at surgery were compared with preoperative evaluation with CT. Correlations were identified and criteria developed that can be used to identify patients needing surgical intervention in frontal sinus trauma. These criteria include findings of either a fracture involving the base of the frontal sinus or a fracture of the anterior ethmoid complex, or both.\r"

The mean T2 (+/- standard deviation) was 120 +/- 62 for hemorrhage and 61 +/- 11 for white matter. Pseudodensity values were normalized to a white matter value of 1, and the value for hemorrhage was 1.56 +/- 0.28. These values were used to determine which components of hemorrhage-white matter contrast are due to T1, T2, and density. The results indicate that on spin-echo (SE) images obtained with a long repetition time (TR)/short echo time (TE) (2,500/0-20 [TR msec/TE msec]), the contrast is mainly due to density differences, with a modest T2 contribution on 20-msec-TE images and nearly no T1 component. At 600/0-20, the contrast continues to be largely determined by density differences, again with a modest T2 component on 20-msec-TE images. If the T1 of hemorrhage is extremely short, the T1 component of contrast on 600/0-20 SE images will be somewhat greater than the density component. Because contrast on short TR/short TE images may be largely or entirely determined by pseudodensity or T2, it is inaccurate to refer to 600/20 images as \"T1-weighted\". The assumption that high signal intensity at this sequence implies a \"short T1\" will lead to misleading conclusions.\r"

The partial-flip sequence was particularly sensitive to magnetic susceptibility; this produced artifacts that may undermine the usefulness of partial flip for routine screening in certain parts of the brain.

Results of CT scans and myelograms from 461 patients with symptoms of lumbar root compression, probably due to LDH, were evaluated and compared with surgical results, if available. The sensitivity of myelography exceeded that of CT (82% vs. 73%), but its specificity was lower (67% vs. 77%). The positive predictive value of myelography only slightly differed from that of CT (93% vs. 94%). These results were used to establish a sequential diagnostic workup for patients with radiating leg pain.

A section-selective gradient refocusing pulse sequence with a short repetition time caused flow-related enhancement from spins that flowed perpendicular to the transaxial sections. The signal was further enhanced by means of flow compensation gradients to rephase any phase shifts resulting from moving spins in the presence of the imaging gradients. Coronal and sagittal sections, reformatted from multiple transaxial sections, are shown to have excellent vessel contrast without the use of contrast material. These images were obtained in 12 minutes of acquisition time from as many as 60 sections of 3-mm thickness. Such a technique shows significant promise for MR angiography.\r"

The sequence exploits the automatic paired averaging capability that is used in commercial magnetic resonance imaging systems for data averaging to achieve lipid suppression. This can be easily implemented via a minor modification to an existing partial saturation sequence. This approach provides linear suppression of lipid signals that is independent of the relative abundance of water and lipid contributions, unlike the characteristics of the original Dixon sequence. The proposed sequence can be tuned before the imaging procedure to ensure optimum timing and frequency adjustment.\r"

The uniformity of response of these coils is poor, since signal reception is weighted toward the surface of the object, which generally is of least interest. Furthermore, whole-section transmitter coils excite the subject uniformly, so that weak signals are detected from far regions. A dual-coil arrangement permits avoidance of these problems by combining the nonuniform excitation and reception characteristics of two surface coils.\r"

Factors influencing the success of stricture intubation included patient age, stricture location (esophageal vs. nonesophageal and proximal vs. distal esophageal), and association with a surgical anastomosis. Malignancy was associated with greater postdilation irregularity and a smaller increase in stricture diameter, as measured radiographically. Procedural failures occurred in 8% of cases (2% of esophageal and 30% of nonesophageal lesions). Two small, asymptomatic mucosal tears were seen after dilation (one esophageal and one colonic); no other procedural complications occurred.

After learning to categorize syllables consisting of [d], [b], or [g] followed by four different vowels, quail correctly categorized syllables in which the same consonants preceded eight novel vowels. Acoustic analysis of the categorized syllables revealed no single feature or pattern of features that could support generalization, suggesting that the quail adopted a more complex mapping of stimuli into categories. These results challenge theories of speech sound classification that posit uniquely human capacities.\r"

This compartment is mobilized to the plasma membrane much more readily than any identified granule subset and has kinetics of up-regulation in the membrane similar to those reported for a variety of receptor proteins. Triton X-100 permeabilization of both intact human neutrophils and subcellular fractions obtained by density-gradient centrifugation revealed that 70 percent of the alkaline phosphatase is located in an intracellular compartment distinct from primary, secondary, and gelatinase granules and from the plasma membrane. This compartment fully translocates to the plasma membrane after stimulation with nanomolar concentrations of the chemotactic peptide N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine.\r"

Dorsal retinal ganglion cell axons project to ventral tectum, and ventral retinal ganglion cells project to dorsal tectum. Topographic gradients of toponymic (TOP) cell surface molecules along the dorsoventral axes of retina and tectum also are inverted. TOP molecules are most abundant in dorsal retina and ventral tectum and least abundant in ventral retina and dorsal tectum during the period of initial retinal-tectal interaction. Thus, TOP molecules may be involved in orienting the retinotectal map.\r"
