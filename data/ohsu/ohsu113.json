  ".W": "A 65-year-old man with hematuria had a large polypoid tumor of the urinary bladder which on microscopic examination was an osteosarcoma, only the 22nd example reported in this organ. The tumor was initially misinterpreted as a transitional cell carcinoma because of an absence of osteoid in the initial slide prepared from a biopsy of the neoplasm. Most of the patients with osteosarcoma of the bladder have been male; they have ranged from 41 to 83 (average 62) years of age. The tumors have characteristically been large and polypoid and have most commonly been located in the trigone. Follow-up is available for 21 patients; 18 of them died within 6 months or less. Three patients were still alive 14 months, 18 months, and 2 years postoperatively. Osteosarcoma of the bladder should be distinguished from other bladder tumors that may be associated with bone formation such as carcinosarcomas and transitional cell carcinomas with osseous metaplasia of their stroma, both of which have a better prognosis than osteosarcoma.\r"

Drugs under study were added in a liquid overlay 2 days after initiation of cultures, providing prolonged exposure to these agents thereafter. Dose-dependent inhibition of colony growth was recorded with each of eleven agents examined, and at the higher concentrations tested, colony formation was often completely suppressed. Cytarabine showed selectivity against CFU-GM from patients in the chronic stage of CGL (P = 0.006); the median 50% inhibitory concentration for 12 such patients was 3.4 ng/ml versus 11.8 ng/ml for 15 healthy subjects. Such selectivity was not found with busulfan, hydroxyurea, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, daunorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, methotrexate, desacetylmethylcolchicine, and trimethylcolchicinic acid. One other group has also reported a preferential effect of cytarabine against colony-forming cells from patients with CGL, and this appears to be the only drug for which such selective activity has been recorded to date.\r"

Treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy had been given 10 months previously for a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of diffuse large cell type arising in the Waldeyer's ring. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated a high density mass in the left frontal cerebrum, which was enhanced uniformly by the contrast material. Cytocentrifuge examination of cerebrospinal fluid also showed an excess of promyelocytes. From these observations, the mass was considered to be an infiltration of leukemic cells. The intracerebral mass and meningeal involvement were resolved concomitantly with a hematologic remission of APL after intrathecal injection of cytosine arabinoside and systemic combination chemotherapy. This is a particular case of APL previously undescribed, representing an unusual presentation with intracerebral APL mass as well as a rare posttherapeutic APL following NHL.\r"

Pancytopenia and extensive hemophagocytosis by macrophages in the bone marrow were observed after reinduction chemotherapy and again at the terminal stage. At autopsy, infiltration of such cells was also found in other organs. The findings suggested occurrence of hemophagocytic syndrome probably associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The t(11;14)(p15;q11) may be a novel translocation specific for T-cell ALL, and conceivably, the association of T-cell ALL with the histiocytosis in this patient may not have been coincidental.\r"

Solubilization of epithelial cell adenylate cyclase with Lubrol PX, which separates the receptor moiety of the cyclase from the remainder of the complex, inhibited the prostaglandin E2 stimulation of the cyclase. A similar result was obtained with VIP, which activates adenylate cyclase via a receptor-mediated mechanism, whereas fluoride, gamma S-GTP, and forskolin, which activate the cyclase via non-receptor-mediated mechanisms, all stimulated solubilized adenylate cyclase. In addition, prostaglandin E2 and VIP both showed a dependence on GTP for adenylate cyclase stimulation while fluoride and forskolin did not. These data suggest that prostaglandin E2 activates intestinal mucosal adenylate cyclase by a receptor-mediated mechanism. The presence of such receptors lends support to the possibility that prostaglandins have a physiological role in the control of mucosal transport.\r"

To elucidate the mechanism of this diuretic resistance, we measured para-aminohippurate and inulin clearances and urinary excretion of electrolytes, prostaglandin E2, and furosemide after intravenous administration of 80 mg of furosemide in 26 patients. The natriuretic response was variable (3.3-172 mEq/h) and was unrelated to basal sodium excretion, renal clearances, or urinary prostaglandin E2. Natriuresis correlated negatively with plasma aldosterone (r = -0.54, p less than 0.01), and strongly with urinary furosemide (range 5.5-76 mg/h, r = 0.71, p less than 0.001). As urinary furosemide excretion reflects the amount of furosemide reaching the active site on the luminal side of the tubule, the data demonstrate markedly reduced amounts of furosemide at its primary site of action in patients with diuretic resistance. Plasma furosemide was higher in patients with reduced furosemide excretion and impaired natriuresis, suggesting that the defect was an impairment of furosemide transport into the tubule. Thus, a major factor in diuretic resistance is altered furosemide pharmacokinetics.\r"

However, after 11 and 4 days respectively, diarrhea recurred accompanied by a rise in vasoactive intestinal peptide plasma levels. In fact, under treatment with the somatostatin analogue and with natural somatostatin, a significant rebound state was observed regarding diarrhea as well as vasoactive intestinal peptide levels, which caused considerable difficulty in the clinical management in 1 patient. This patient had to undergo surgery. In the second patient, the responsiveness to somatostatin analogue returned a few days after discontinuation of the treatment, lasting, however, for a short period only. The possible mechanism of this escape and rebound with somatostatin treatment is discussed.\r"

Intestinal permeability increased significantly from control levels following each drug and the effect was related to drug potency to inhibit cyclooxygenase. Intestinal permeability increased to a similar extent after oral and rectal administration of indomethacin showing that the effect is systemically mediated. Prostaglandin E2 decreased intestinal permeability significantly but failed to prevent the indomethacin induced increased intestinal permeability. These studies show that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs disrupt the intestinal barrier function in man and suggest that the morphological correlates of the damage may reside at the level of the intercellular junctions.\r"

To investigate its molecular basis at the nucleic acid level, we isolated muscle phosphorylase cDNA clones from a human cDNA library in Escherichia coli plasmid pBR 322. Subcloning of one insertion of M13 bacteriophage permitted its definite identification by sequencing. Northern blot experiments revealed one specific messenger RNA of 3.4 kilobases found uniquely in tissues expressing muscle phosphorylase. We show that McArdle's disease exhibits a molecular heterogeneity at the messenger RNA level. In eight unrelated cases of McArdle's disease in which no inactive proteins had been detected, we assayed muscle biopsies for phosphorylase mRNA by Northern blotting. In five cases, no muscle phosphorylase mRNA could be detected, while in three other cases, normal length mRNA was present in lower amounts. Moreover, Southern blot analysis of DNA isolated from white blood cells in four McArdle patients revealed no major deletion or rearrangements of the phosphorylase gene as compared with controls.\r"

Twenty-four hours after surgery, each patient answered a questionnaire designed to assess his or her recall of events during and after surgery. Patients who received midazolam alone recalled significantly less than did patients in either diazepam group. The addition of fentanyl to midazolam did not produce any significant difference in recall.\r"

Lost dentin should not be replaced with a base in an attempt to simulate an ideal preparation. A stronger base should not be placed over a weaker base, for strength. The entire base is only as strong as the weakest component. Covering the entire pulpal floor with a base should be avoided. Sound dentin surrounding the base should be left so that the amalgam restoration is supported by dentin as much as possible.\r"

  ".U": "87084781\r", 
  ".W": "We used the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line to analyze the surface expression of a family of adherence-related leukocyte surface antigens during myeloid differentiation. These antigens are composed of discrete alpha subunits, designated alpha L, alpha M, and alpha X, that are each noncovalently associated with a common beta subunit. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the individual subunits served as markers in both indirect immunofluorescence studies and immunoprecipitations from HL-60 cells differentiated preferentially towards mature granulocytes (DMSO, retinoic acid) or monocyte/macrophages (PMA, vitamin D3). In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, the alpha L and alpha X subunits were constitutively expressed, whereas the alpha M subunit was not. Differentiation of HL-60 cells along the granulocytic pathway with DMSO resulted in a marked increase in alpha M and minimal increases in alpha L and alpha X. The phenotypic expression of these antigens on DMSO-treated HL-60 cells closely resembled that on normal circulating PMN. Differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage pathway when using PMA or vitamin D3 resulted in major increases in alpha L and alpha X expression, as well as alpha M. These changes resulted in a surface phenotype characteristic of that present on human monocyte-derived macrophages. Triggering of undifferentiated HL-60 cells with PMA caused no increase in subunit expression, whereas stimulation of DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells with PMA produced more than a 1.5-fold enhancement of both the alpha M and alpha X subunits, and stimulation of human PMN with PMA increased the surface expression of alpha M more than fourfold and alpha X subunit twofold. Stimulation with PMA produced no change in expression of the alpha L subunit in any of the three cell populations. These results indicate that the alpha subunits of this glycoprotein family can be selectively regulated during in vitro differentiation of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Second, DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells and human PMN possessed an intracellular pool of alpha M and alpha X, but not alpha L, that could be translocated to the surface. Thus, despite structural and functional relationships among the alpha subunits in this glycoprotein family, they undergo disparate surface expression and intracellular regulation during differentiation.\r"

To elucidate this finding, 29 patients were sequentially scanned with 2.0 mCi of 201Tl (5-30 min), 20 mCi [99mTc]gluceptate (GH) (3-4 hr) and 7-10 mCi 67Ga (48-72 hr). A total of 198 images were obtained. A set of three scans at a midpoint in follow up was selected for analysis. Seven patients who died had neuropathologic data available; brain sections were reconstructed to match radionuclide views without knowledge of image results. In the seven patients with autopsy data, 201Tl offered the most accurate correlation with viable tumor. Gallium-67 gave similar results in patients not receiving steroids. Technetium-99m GH scans could not allow differentiation between tumor, necrosis, and edema. Similarly, the CT scan could not routinely differentiate between fibrotic, nonfibrotic, necrotic, and neoplastic tissue. In the 22 patients without autopsy data, 201Tl scans commonly showed smaller and more focal abnormal uptake when compared with [99mTc]GH and 67Ga scans. Thallium-201 scans more accurately reflect viable tumor burden than other radionuclide studies of primary brain tumors, are minimally affected by concomitant steroid administration, can be performed immediately following tracer administration, and complement the anatomic data obtained from CT scans.\r"

There was a marked difference in the alveolar mucosal viability with the two grafts. Mucosal dehiscence was not observed over any of the microvascular grafts, but was present in seven-eighths of the free grafts. Union of the microvascular bone graft to the host bone occurred within six weeks. In contrast, after six weeks the free graft was sequestered in all the animals. An unexpected finding with both types of graft was the marked subperiosteal bone formation. This bone appeared to be derived from the host bed, stabilizing and bridging the defects bilaterally. The results suggest that radiated periosteum may play an important role in osteogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to determine the effects of the vasoactive drug naftidrofuryl on vascular smooth muscle, endothelial cells and adrenergic nerves in isolated canine blood vessels. Naftidrofuryl inhibited contractions of basilar arteries (in a decreasing order of potency), evoked by 5-hydroxytryptamine greater than KCl = anoxia (in rings with endothelium) greater than prostaglandin F2 alpha = uridine-5'-triphosphate. Naftidrofuryl antagonized competitively the contractions evoked by 5-hydroxytryptamine in the femoral artery and the saphenous vein. Naftidrofuryl caused the release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) from the endothelium of femoral arteries. The compound depressed contractions of saphenous veins evoked by electrical stimulation of the adrenergic nerve endings, but not those caused by the indirect sympathomimetic amine tyramine or exogenous norepinephrine. In saphenous veins incubated previously with [3H]norepinephrine, the drug inhibited the contractions and the release of transmitter evoked by electrical stimulation. Thus, naftidrofuryl acts at different levels in the blood vessel wall to cause: release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s); inhibition of S2-serotonergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle; prejunctional inhibition of adrenergic neurotransmission; and nonselective inhibition of the contractile process in vascular smooth muscle, which is particularly pronounced in cerebral arteries.\r"

  ".W": "A number of beta adrenergic blocking drugs were evaluated on ring preparations of endothelium intact and denuded segments of the rat aorta. The preparations were preconstricted under isometric conditions with an EC80 dose of phenylephrine. Labetalol (10(-7)-10(-5) M), MK-761 10(-7)-10(-5) M), timolol (10(-7)-10(-4) M) and propranolol (10(-6)-10(-4) M) relaxed both endothelium intact and denuded vessels in a dose-dependent manner. Spirendalol (2.8 X 10(-8)-8.1 X 10(-6) M), a specific beta-2 receptor antagonist and L643717 (1.8 X 10(-7)-3.6 X 10(-6) M), a specific beta-1 receptor antagonist did not elicit relaxation. Labetalol, MK-761, timolol and propranolol promoted relaxation only when vascular segments were preconstricted with phenylephrine or norepinephrine and failed to do so when prostaglandin F2 alpha or U46619 were used. This indicates a possible displacement of alpha adrenergic agonists with the beta antagonists. The degree of relaxation induced by labetalol, MK-761, timolol and propranolol was significantly less (P less than .05) when the endothelium was removed. Eicosatetraynoic acid (3.2 X 10(-5) M) significantly attenuated the relaxation response to labetalol, MK-761 and timolol in the intact but not in denuded vascular preparations. These studies suggest that some of the vascular effects of beta blockers may relate to the endothelium.\r"

Of 18 patients with constitutional symptoms and a low T-helper cell count at their first visit, nine developed AIDS; of the remaining 57 patients, five developed AIDS (five-year cumulative incidence rates, 57% and 18%, respectively, P less than .001). Patients with lymphadenopathy syndrome are at continuing risk for the development of AIDS.

Prevalence of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus in serum samples from Dominicans tested from 1983 through 1985 was low in comparison with that of clinically healthy Haitians working in the country. The Haitians, who gave no history of any known risk factor, had a seroprevalence to the virus of more than 10%. Only Dominican homosexuals had a high rate of seropositivity (19%); intravenous drug abusers, healthy heterosexuals, female prostitutes, and other subgroups had virtually no evidence of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus. These results suggest that passage of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome retrovirus between populations in two countries on the same island did not occur except by known risk practices. They emphasize that the extent of viral transmission in Haiti is greater than that observed in the Dominican Republic.\r"

OSAAs were isolated from the spent culture medium of a human osteosarcoma cell line (TE-85). Five hybrid clones were established and designated as OSA1, OSA2, OSA3, OSA4, and OSA5. OSA1 and OSA2 had similar activity. All 5 MoAbs reacted strongly with most osteosarcoma cell lines and with all osteosarcoma tissues tested but not with 10 tumor cell lines and 2 tumor tissues from other cancers. OSA3, OSA4, and OSA5 cross-reacted with a fibrosarcoma cell line, a colon cell line, and fibrosarcoma, respectively, as well as with a melanoma cell line. None of the MoAbs were reactive with activated normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Immunoprecipitation of membrane protein isolated from LM cells and TE-85 cells with the MoAbs OSA1 and OSA2 conjugated with Staphylococcus aureus yielded a molecule with molecular weight of approximately 92,000. No detectable membrane protein was precipitated when 125I-labeled membrane protein from pooled activated human PBMC and tumor cells of other histologic types were used in the immunoprecipitation.\r"

This resistant cell line, designated \"KFr,\" was capable of proliferating in the presence of 1.0 micrograms cisplatin/ml. It had doubling times of 24.8 and 27.2 hours in the presence of 0.5 and 1.0 micrograms cisplatin/ml, respectively. The KFr cells had lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities about fourfold higher than those of the parent KF-1 cells. Analysis of the isozymes of the KFr cells revealed that they had a faint LDH-3 band in addition to LDH-4, the only stained band in the parent KF-1 cells. The morphologic characteristics of the KFr cells were an enlarged nucleus and prominent nucleoli, unlike the nucleus and nucleoli of the parent KF-1 cells. The degree of resistance to cisplatin of the KFr cells was about twenty-fold higher than that of the KF-1 cells, with regard to the concentrations of cisplatin required for 50% inhibition of cell proliferation. However, when 5 microM calmodulin antagonists [N-(6-aminohexyl)-1-naphthalenesulfonamide or N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide] were added in the presence of concentrations of cisplatin that hardly inhibited cell proliferation, the KFr cell proliferation was markedly inhibited. These results suggest that cisplatin resistance can be overcome by calmodulin antagonists.\r"

One fixative, formaldehyde, has recently been shown to cause nasal cancer in laboratory rodents. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess whether anatomists have an increased risk of mortality from cancer, particularly from cancers of the respiratory tract. The cohort included 2,317 men who joined the American Association of Anatomists between 1888 and 1969 and who were living in the United States when they joined this association. Standardized mortality ratios were 0.3 for lung cancer [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.1-0.5], 1.5 for leukemia (95% CI = 0.7-2.7), and 2.7 for brain cancer (95% CI = 1.3-5.0) when mortality rates for U.S. white males, available for 1925-79, were used as the referent. When rates for male members of the American Psychiatric Association, available for 1900-69, were used as the referent, standardized mortality ratios were 0.5 for lung cancer (95% CI = 0.2-1.1) and 6.0 for brain cancer (95% CI = 2.3-15.6). Each of the 10 anatomists who died of brain cancer between 1925 and 1979 had a neuroglial cell tumor (either astrocytoma or glioblastoma). The increased risk for leukemia was limited to the myeloid cell type. An etiologic agent associated with these increased risks was not identified.\r"

In addition, HT-29 cells produced substances that had an appreciable chemokinetic activity on PMNs. These tumor-secreted substances appeared to act directly on the PMNs rather than indirectly by interacting with nonadherent mononuclear cells, e.g., lymphocytes. Such a priming activity to display enhanced production of O2- was also found in conditioned medium from F344 rat FR3T3 embryonic fibroblasts but not in conditioned medium from HT-29 repolarized cells (by culture in galactose-containing medium) or from nontumorous human colonic mucosa explants. Such active substances may be important in the host-tumor relationship and, therefore, in the outcome of tumor growth.\r"

  ".W": "A reproducible and convenient microassay was developed by us to measure the antiproliferative activity of biological materials and anticancer drugs. The assay involved the labeling of target cells after their incubation with anticancer agents with the fluorescent vital dye hydroethidine at a dose of 28 micrograms/ml for 30 minutes. Once internalized into live cells, hydroethidine is dehydrogenated to ethidium, which then intercalates into DNA. Hydroethidine labeled the cells uniformly. The cells were lysed with detergent, and the relative fluorescence of this dye was monitored in a microfluorimeter at the speed of 30 seconds per 96-well plate. Because this assay is accurate and reproducible, does not present problems of disposal of labeling agents, and is extremely rapid, it should prove very useful for the screening of many potential anticancer agents with antiproliferative activity.\r"

  ".W": "Skin fibroblasts (SFs) from patients with adenomatosis of the colon and rectum (ACR) were shown, in general, to express elevated amounts of the p53 antigen as determined by immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal antibody PAb421. Infection with simian virus 40 (SV40) induced expression of the p53 antigen in SFs from normal individuals and further amplified its expression in ACR cells. The half-lives of the p53 antigen in mock-infected ACR cells and in SV40-transformed normal or ACR cells were about 2 and 15 hours, respectively. No immediate differences were detected in the coding segment of the human p53 gene between normal and ACR cells by either Southern or Northern blot analysis. These results suggest that over-expression of the p53 antigen is due, in part, to the increased stability of the p53 antigen in ACR cells. Over-expression represents an early event that is possibly associated with initiation and promotion of inherited colon cancer.\r"

In separate groups, hamsters were given the diet supplemented with 0.1 ppm Se until 5 days after carcinogen treatment. Then they were fed either the unsupplemented diet or the diet supplemented with 5.0 ppm Se until the end of the experiment. N-Nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP; CAS; 60599-38-4) treatment was given as a single sc injection of 20 mg/kg (body wt) at 8 weeks of age, and surviving hamsters were killed 50 weeks later. As a measure of Se status, glutathione peroxidase (GSHPX) activities were determined in plasma, erythrocytes, and liver. Values were elevated in animals fed higher levels of dietary Se. BOP treatment depressed plasma GSHPX at 24 hours and elevated erythrocyte and liver values at 4 weeks. Pancreatic ductular adenoma yields were inhibited with each elevation of dietary Se in female hamsters fed the diets, both before and after BOP administration, and were further inhibited in females that were fed diets containing 0.1 ppm Se before BOP administration and that were changed to the unsupplemented or 5.0-ppm-supplemented diets after BOP was given. Pancreatic ductular adenoma yields were highest in all male groups given diets of 0.1 ppm Se before BOP administration, irrespective of the Se level after BOP was fed. Adenoma yields in males were lowest in hamsters fed unsupplemented diet, both before and after BOP treatment. Pancreatic carcinoma yields were low and not influenced by dietary Se. The incidence of hepatic necrosis was elevated in BOP-treated hamsters fed the unsupplemented diet, and that of biliary cystic adenomas was highest in the group fed 0.1 ppm Se before and after BOP treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The binding and killing of a number of murine (DBA/2J) leukemia cell lines by murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (M phi s) were studied under various conditions to provide clues to the nature and specificity of tumor recognition by M phi s. Under test was the hypothesis that tumor target binding by activated M phi s is effected by saturable, high-affinity, trypsin and low temperature-sensitive receptors, whereas target binding by normal M phi s is of low affinity, nonsaturable, insensitive to low temperature and trypsin, and is believed not to be mediated by conventional receptors. The results obtained showed that this scenario was realized only rarely and that each target cell line had its own distinctive binding characteristics. Thus target binding by both unactivated and activated M phi s can be sensitive or insensitive to trypsin and low temperature depending on the target in question. This finding suggests that the binding of different targets is mediated by distinct receptors or different combinations of receptors. Contrary to previous reports, the binding of all targets tested was found to decrease with M phi activation and induction of cytotoxicity, but whatever binding strength that remained was obviously adequate for the manifestation of cytotoxicity. Fractionation of M phi s according to size (and hence maturity) revealed that tumor binding capacity (per unit surface area) increased with M phi size. Although target binding decreased in all M phi fractions after activation, it still correlated with cytotoxic activity and cell size for a given activated M phi population. Thus target binding correlates well with antitumor potential in unactivated Mos and with cytotoxic activity in activated M phi s.\r"

The malignant potentials of 3 different HCCs derived from a primary tumor (HCC-P4733), a lymph node metastasis (HCC-M14328), and a hepatic metastasis (HCC-M1410) were investigated following implantation into the spleens of athymic nude mice. Cells of the HCC-M1410 line produced extensive liver tumors in all mice by 30 days after injection. Cells of the HCC-M14328 and HCC-P4733 lines produced few liver tumors in the inoculated mice and then only after a 90-day period. Isozyme and karyotype analyses ascertained the human origin of all the tumors. Studies with [125I]IdUrd-labeled HT-29 carcinoma cells suggested that tumor cells reached the liver shortly after injection into the spleen. Thus the production of HCC tumors in livers of nude mice was determined by the ability of HCC cells to proliferate in the liver parenchyma rather than by the ability of the cells to reach the liver. The results suggest that the intrasplenic injection of HCC cells can provide a valuable model for the study of the biology and therapy of the liver metastases.\r"

These studies compared the history of tonsillectomy among incident cases with that of all their siblings by matched analysis controlling for confounding by childhood social class, family size, and birth order. Among young adults (15-39 yr) there is substantial evidence that tonsillectomy is not a risk factor and the relative risk (RR) is 1.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.4). Among middle-aged persons (40-54 yr) the RR is not significantly elevated, 1.5 (0.67-3.3), and the direction of the association differs between the sexes, consistent with the hypothesis of no association. Among older persons, the RR is significantly elevated, 3.0 (1.3-6.9), but the data are sparse. On the basis of these data, it appears unlikely that prior tonsillectomy is a causal factor in the development of HD in young and middle-aged adulthood. Whether it is a risk factor for the malignancy occurring late in life is unclear.\r"

The same dose given sc for 6 weeks had no significant effect on pancreatic wet weight and DNA or RNA contents. However, when given to animals receiving N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine [(BOP) CAS: 60599-38-4] (5 mg/kg), it reduced the latency and increased the induction rate of tumor development when compared with the carcinogen given alone to animals (secretin + BOP, 15 of 17 animals with tumors; BOP alone, 4 of 13 with tumors at 15 wk; P less than .002). These effects are consistent with secretin acting as a cocarcinogen in this model of pancreatic carcinogenesis.\r"

Following exposures during culture, the fragments were transplanted into the mammary fat pads of syngeneic rats. The transplanted fragments survived for at least 1 year with preservation of crypt architecture and with continued DNA and mucin synthesis. Exposure in culture to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (CAS: 70-25-7) or N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (CAS: 684-93-5) resulted in hypercellularity, hyperplasia, and cellular atypia in the transplants; but, in contrast to transplants from colon adenocarcinomas, no tumors formed. Exposure in culture to deoxycholic acid subsequent to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine resulted in greater cellular abnormalities in transplants. Exposure after N-methyl-N-nitrosourea to fecal extracts from rats on a high-fat diet also enhanced the pathologic changes, whereas similar extracts from rats on a low-fat diet did not alter the pathology resulting from N-methyl-N-nitrosourea or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine exposures. It is concluded that bile acids, including those formed in vivo, facilitate the expression of carcinogen-induced abnormalities in the colon mucosa.\r"

These TNF preparations, however, did not affect the spontaneous migration of the BCE cells. When mouse TNF was further fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, only TNF-positive fractions showed an inhibitory activity on the tumor-induced endothelial motility. Moreover, monoclonal antibody against rabbit TNF completely neutralized its migration-inhibitory activity. These findings indicate that the observed inhibitory effect of TNF preparations on the endothelial motility evoked by tumor is exclusively ascribed to the function of TNF. This activity presumably is involved in the suppression of tumor angiogenesis in vivo.\r"

Tumor incidence in Swiss Webster mice was 0-3% in groups not receiving urethan and was 61-74% in groups receiving urethan. In A/J mice, the corresponding values were 9-38% and 100%, respectively. Exposure to ozone caused a decrease in the number of tumors per lung in urethan-treated mice of both strains, in a dose-dependent manner. There seemed to be a specific decrease in tumors derived from alveolar type II cells in the A/J mice given urethan plus ozone. Most interesting, perhaps, was a significant increase in the number of tumors per lung in A/J mice exposed to 0.8 ppm ozone without urethan, confirming a previous report by others. The corresponding ozone effect on lung tumor development was not observed in Swiss Webster mice.\r"

Cationized ferritin, which binds electrostatically to anionic sites on the plasma membrane, was used as a membrane marker in a morphometrical ultrastructural study. The nonspecific adsorptive endocytosis was significantly increased in Ehrlich ascites tumor cell lines resistant to daunorubicin (DNR), doxorubicin, vincristine, and vinblastine compared to that in sensitive cells. Thus cells resistant to DNR internalized 2.04% of their plasma membrane per minute, in contrast to 1.17% in sensitive cells. Because the measured cell surface areas in sensitive and resistant cells were unchanged during the experiments, increased membrane traffic (recycling) from intracytoplasmic compartments to the plasma membrane must have occurred in resistant cells. Possible implications of these findings include a resistance-linked phenotype without significance for resistance per se, an increase in membrane repair, and a connection between increased membrane traffic and increased active drug extrusion in resistant cells.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of endogenous retroviral env products on primary leukemia cells of mice was studied with the use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies that discriminate between the various classes of murine leukemia viruses [MuLVs; ecotropic, xenotropic, and mink cell focus-forming (MCF)], as well as between various subtypes within each class. Most spontaneous AKR or Friend MuLV (F-MuLV)- or Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV)-induced AKR or NFS mouse leukemia cells expressed no xenotropic viral envelope antigens but always expressed MCF proteins. Spontaneous C58 lymphomas, on the other hand, often expressed xenotropic proteins in addition to MCF proteins. The subtype of MCF envelope antigens present on leukemia cells, as well as on isolated MCF viruses, varied in a reproducible manner, depending on the mouse strain inoculated and the ecotropic virus used (F-MuLV or M-MuLV). Specifically, F-MuLV consistently induced certain type(s) of MCF envelope antigens on leukemia cells of NFS mice, whereas M-MuLV induced different ones. Similar antigenic patterns were found on the MCF viruses isolated from these mice. Furthermore, MCF envelope antigens (on viruses or leukemia cells) induced in NFS mice by M-MuLV differed from those induced in AKR mice. This finding demonstrated a mouse strain influence on the endogenous MCF env sequences expressed following infection by a given ecotropic virus. The endogenous MCF env sequences in mice thus appear to be a set of genes highly expressed during leukemogenesis, with particular ones specifically expressed in a given mouse strain infected with a given ecotropic virus.\r"

  ".W": "The sensitivity of a common acute lymphoblastic leukemia-associated antigen (cALLa)-positive, human leukemia pre-B-cell line to killing by antibody and complement was studied. A stable subpopulation was selected by its ability to survive four sequential treatments with excess monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed against an Mr 24,000 glycoprotein associated with human leukemia cells and excess rabbit complement. Analysis of the antigen expression by individual cells within the parental and the selected cell populations was achieved by flow cytometry and demonstrated a marked decrease of the leukemia-associated antigen expression on individual cells within the selected subpopulation. These low-antigen-density cells were stable in subculture, and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement of the parent population and the low-antigen-density subpopulation were identical, indicating that they were derived from a single cell source. The selection of this subpopulation was specific in that the expression of a second antigen recognized by a cALLa-specific MoAb was not affected. The presence of subpopulations of tumor cells with low levels of surface antigen expression that are resistant to killing upon addition of excess antibody and complement will prove to be an obstacle to the use of this approach to eliminate tumor cells from bone marrow that is to be used for autologous transplantation.\r"

The associations of these 3 subtypes with pigmentation, skin reaction to sun, different types of sun exposure, sunburn, and suntan were assessed. Compared to the other types, LMM occurred in older patients, and 75% of lesions occurred on the head and neck: It was less strongly related to pigmentation factors, intermittent sun exposure, and skin reaction to sun. The associations of SSM and NM with pigmentation, chronic sun exposure, skin reaction, and suntan were very similar: Both were associated with intermittent sun exposure, but SSM was more strongly related to vacation exposures than was NM. These results were compared with those from a similar Australian study. While LMM appears different in its etiology from SSM and NM, there is no strong evidence of major etiological differences between SSM and NM.\r"

A ganglioside fraction was isolated and purified from each of these tissues, and the amount of each component ganglioside was assessed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and a TLC scanner. Five gangliosides (GM3, GD3, GM2, GD2, and alkali-labile ganglioside) were most commonly expressed by these melanomas. However, the total ganglioside amount (ranging from 33 to 302 micrograms/g wet wt of tissue) as well as the distribution of each ganglioside were widely heterogeneous in both biopsied and cultured melanomas. When the ganglioside expressions of cultured and biopsied melanomas were compared, GM2 and GD2 were minor components of biopsied melanomas but often became major components of cultured melanoma cells. Conversely, alkali-labile ganglioside was expressed more strongly on biopsied melanomas. This heterogeneity suggests that it will be necessary to analyze the ganglioside composition of biopsied melanomas before using monoclonal antibodies to melanoma-associated gangliosides for melanoma diagnosis or therapy.\r"

  ".W": "An increased synthesis of the ganglioside GM2 has been reported on transformed murine cells, human fetal tissues, and transformed melanocytes. This study was designed to investigate whether any correlation existed between GM2 expression and the tumorigenicity of human melanoma. Ten established human melanoma cell lines, 5 rich in GM2 (group A) and 5 poor in GM2 (group B), were selected on the basis of previous ganglioside analysis of 28 melanoma cell lines. Six athymic nude mice per cell line were given an sc injection of 10(6) human melanoma cells/mouse. Tumors were measured every 2-4 days. By day 36 after the injection, 28 of 30 mice (93%) in group A developed medium to large tumors, but only 1 of 30 (3%) in group B developed a small tumor (P less than .005). The correlation of GM2 content of individual melanomas with tumor growth rate also was very high. GM2 content was expressed as nanomoles per gram wet weight of each melanoma. The area under the log values of tumor growth curves from day 0 to day 36, which represented tumor growth rate, tumor size, and latent period, was proportional to GM2 content, with a correlation coefficient of 0.927 and with P less than .001. The same log relationship when tested with other gangliosides, GM3, GD3, and GD2, was not statistically significant. These results, combined with the fact that variations in GM2 content do not affect in vitro growth of human melanoma cells, suggest that GM2 expression may be directly related to the dedifferentiation or the tumorigenicity of human melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "Monocytes from patients with head and neck tumors display a marked chemotactic deficiency in response to formylpeptide chemoattractants. Normal leukocytes possess receptors known to bind to chemotactic formylpeptides such as the hexapeptide N-formyl-nor-leucyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-nor-leucyl-tyrosyl-lysine, with high specificity and great avidity. Light microscopic autoradiography was used to visualize the binding and subsequent cellular processing of the formylhexapeptide N-formyl-nor-leucyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-nor-leucyl-[125I]tyrosyl-lysine to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocytes from patients with epidermoid tumors of the head and neck. Surface-adherent leukocytes were exposed to 5 nM 125I-labeled hexapeptide for 15 minutes at 4 degrees C and were either fixed immediately or rinsed and then further incubated for 20 minutes at 37 degrees C prior to fixation. Cells underwent autoradiography, and silver grains associated with 400 cells were counted. There were no significant differences between the numbers of formylpeptide receptors on control and cancer patient PMN. However, there were significantly larger numbers of formylpeptide receptors (P less than .02) on cancer patient monocytes than on control monocytes. Cells that were allowed to process bound hexapeptide at 37 degrees C prior to fixation showed large decreases in the number of cell-associated silver grains. However, the amount of hexapeptide associated with PMN and monocytes treated in this way was the same for both control and tumor patients. In addition, histograms were plotted showing the amount of hexapeptide bound versus the frequency of cells at each level of binding. Examination of these histograms revealed that two major peaks or subpopulations occurred in each for neutrophils and monocytes from control patients. Histograms of grain counts for neutrophils and monocytes from tumor patients did not display two separate peaks of formylhexapeptide binding; instead, only one broad peak was evident. These observations indicated that: Tumor patient PMN expressed as many formylpeptide receptors as did control PMN, and tumor patient monocytes possessed significantly more receptors than did control monocytes. The disposition of formylpeptide initially bound to control and tumor patient leukocytes appeared to be essentially the same. Subpopulations existed in each control neutrophil and monocyte sample, one exhibiting approximately 30% more formylpeptide binding than the other. However, in the leukocytes obtained from tumor patients, the distinction between these two subpopulations had become obscured such that only one cell population was evident.\r"

Cytogenetic analysis revealed a mode of 66 chromosomes. With the use of a variety of banding techniques together with in situ hybridization of a 3H-labeled molecular probe for 18s and 28s ribosomal RNA genes (pX1r101), the karyotypes were shown to contain extensive numerical and structural rearrangements, with up to 24 marker chromosomes.\r"

With the use of data obtained by the western Washington population-based Cancer Surveillance System for 1975-83, the incidence of serous and mucinous borderline epithelial ovarian tumors was analyzed, as well as the survival of women who developed them. The incidence of borderline tumors increased with increasing age, although at a pace somewhat slower than that of malignant ovarian tumors. There was an upward trend in the incidence of borderline tumors starting in the late 1970's, a trend not present for malignant tumors. Only 12% of borderline tumors were not confined to the ovary, as opposed to 40% of malignant Grade I and 73% of other malignant ovarian neoplasms. At 5 years following diagnosis, the survival of women with borderline tumors was 93% that of the general female population. This percentage varied little by stage or histologic type. Given the reduced survival of women with these ovarian tumors and the lack of a sharp histologic distinction between borderline and Grade I malignant lesions, it is recommended that borderline ovarian tumors be routinely ascertained by population-based cancer registries.\r"

FN-positive (FN+) cells lacked GFAP detectable by immunofluorescence. Their mean nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio was large (0.192). Actual mean areas of nuclei (1,252 microns2) and cytoplasm (8,376 microns2) of FN+ cells compared with mean areas of fibroblasts suggested that the high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of FN+ cells was due to their microscopically evident reduced cytoplasmic spreading rather than to larger nuclei. Some FN+ cells showed marked variation in nuclear and nucleolar size and shape. Others had abnormal mitoses or hyperchromatic nuclei. GFAP-positive (GFAP+) cells lacked FN detectable by immunofluorescence. GFAP+ cells were smaller and less round than FN+ cells. Their usual location was growing on a layer of FN+ cells. The mean nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (0.245) of GFAP+ cells was the highest in the study, surpassing the ratio of the continuous glioma line LM (0.176). Mean areas of nuclei (289 microns2) and of cytoplasm (1,350 microns2) of GFAP+ cells suggested that their high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio was due to their microscopically evident reduced cytoplasmic spreading. Reduced spreading was associated with extension of long, thin cytoplasmic processes. The majority of GFAP+ cells showed marked cytoplasmic basophilia, nuclear hyperchromasia, and clumped chromatin. Features observed in both FN+ and GFAP+ cells from this high-grade astrocytoma are features associated with malignant transformation in more thoroughly studied tumor systems.\r"

Only 2 lymphoid and 21 nonlymphoid cancers were expected based on the rates of the western Washington population as a whole. Lung cancer accounted for about one-third of the excess rate observed. Three of the nonlymphoid tumors that occurred in the patients with CLL were classified as malignant fibrous histiocytomas, which represents an exceptionally high relative incidence for this histologic type. The excess risk of nonlymphoid cancers was present in both sexes, across all age categories, and in every length-of-follow-up interval. These results, taken together with those obtained from earlier investigations, suggest that persons with CLL are at increased risk of developing a second tumor, particularly in the lung. The reasons for this increased risk remain to be elucidated.\r"

The average recovery of ROH from serum or plasma was 95%, and the precision of the assay was less than 5%. With this HPLC method, a series of studies was carried out to evaluate the stability of ROH in various matrices. ROH was stable under our HPLC assay conditions as well as in plasma- and in serum-enriched culture media; however, ROH was not stable in aqueous matrices. Serum or heparinized plasma may be routinely used for measurement of ROH concentrations, providing EDTA, oxalate, and citrate are not used as anticoagulants. Because of ROH stability, blood samples can be kept on ice in the dark for at least 24 hours prior to separation of plasma. In addition, plasma samples containing ROH can be stored for up to 1 year at -20 degrees C without loss of stability.\r"

  ".W": "The decapentaplegic gene complex (DPP-C) has been implicated in several events in pattern formation during Drosophila development. During embryogenesis, the DPP-C participates in the establishment of dorsal-ventral specification. Later, it is required for the correct morphogenesis of the imaginal disks, which will form much of the adult epidermis. We have undertaken a molecular analysis of the DPP-C to determine what role it plays in positional information. It appears to be a large genetic unit (greater than 40 kilobases (kb] consisting mostly of cis-regulatory information controlling the expression of a set of overlapping transcripts that differ at their 5' ends, but share the bulk of their transcribed sequences. Here, we describe the sequence analysis of two complementary DNAs comprising 4.0 kb of a 4.5-kb transcript. The C-terminus of the protein thereby deduced exhibits strong sequence homology (25-38% amino-acid identity) to the C-termini of a class of mammalian proteins that includes transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), inhibin and Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS). These proteins act on target cells to produce a variety of responses, such as stimulation or inhibition of cell division or differentiation. The homology suggests that the DPP-C protein contributes to correct morphogenesis as a secreted factor involved in the differential regulation of cell growth. This is the first report of a member of the TGF-beta gene family in a non-mammalian organism, and indicates that one or more members of this gene family existed before arthropod and vertebrate lineages diverged.\r"

Only the oculomotor measurements of saccade and smooth pursuit gain were consistently abnormal in all patients. Identical eye movement recordings in 12 asymptomatic individuals at risk for Machado-Joseph disease revealed findings typical of affected patients in only 1 individual. Quantified oculomotor studies may contribute to the early confirmation of the disease, primarily in individuals at risk with minor or equivocal neurologic signs.\r"

Arthroscopic observations of remodeling, arthrosis, adhesion, and perforation were compared with dissection findings. About half of the joints were arthroscopically diagnosed in agreement with subsequent dissection findings. In the other joints there were discrepancies between arthroscopic and morphologic findings. The discrepancies were, with only two exceptions, underdiagnosis of pathologic changes. This was most pronounced for perforation of the disk, since only three of fourteen perforations were seen through the arthroscope. The position of the disk was difficult to study arthroscopically, since the injected air and the thick arthroscope in the joint compartment altered the positional relationship between the joint components and made it difficult to reproduce joint function during the examination. In conclusion, arthroscopy of the upper compartment of the temporomandibular joint provides information about the articular surfaces that is not available by other methods, and this examination may therefore be a valuable supplement to other diagnostic methods, and this examination may therefore be a valuable supplement to other diagnostic methods. An arthroscopic diagnosis of pathologic changes seems to be reliable (high specificity), but an arthroscopic diagnosis of normality includes a substantial risk of underdiagnosing pathologic changes (low sensitivity).\r"

Morphologic alterations induced during infusion of water- and lipid-soluble radiographic contrast media and the distribution of the media were examined with light and electron microscopy. An uneven distribution of the media throughout the tissue and variations in the degree of the alterations in different parts of the gland were seen at all stages of filling. The changes primarily consisted of dilation of the luminal system, which successively became more pronounced as infusion continued. Infusion of the lipid-based medium consistently resulted in more severe alterations, including changes in the acini. Tracer studies showed that the water-soluble medium leaked out through the intercellular spaces and to the surrounding tissue, whereas the lipid-based medium appeared to be confined to the luminal space. Ductal filling with either medium resulted in a relatively fast recovery; after prolonged infusion, recovery was slower and additional alterations occurred. The acini showed confluence of secretory granules and vacuole formation. After infusion of the lipid-based compound, autophagic vacuoles and granulomatous alterations developed. Prolonged infusion with either medium resulted in atrophy of the parenchyma and connective tissue proliferation in some glands. An inflammatory infiltrate was present in all glands during the recovery period. Functional alterations, primarily consisting of a decrease in flow rate, were noted after prolonged infusion. The increase in intraluminal pressure induced during infusion was most likely the primary cause of the alterations. In addition, the presence of contrast medium contributed to the long-term effects of the procedure.\r"

Despite the relatively few alpha-aminoisobutyric acid residues, the peptide maintains a helical form. The first intrahelical hydrogen bond is of the 3(10) type between N(3) and O(0), followed by five alpha-helix-type hydrogen bonds. Solution 1H NMR studies in chloroform also favor a helical conformation, with seven solvent-shielded NH groups. Continuous columns are formed by head-to-tail hydrogen bonds between the helical molecules along the helix axis. The absence of polar side chains precludes any lateral hydrogen bonds. Since the peptide crystallizes with one molecule in a triclinic space group, aggregation of the helical columns must necessarily be parallel rather than antiparallel. The packing of the columns is rather inefficient, as indicated by very few good van der Waals' contacts and the occurrence of voids between the molecules.\r"

  ".W": "In polarized epithelial cells, influenza virus buds exclusively from the apical domain of the plasma membrane, whereas vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) buds exclusively from the basolateral domain. In virus-infected cells, the envelope proteins, influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV G), are likewise transported to and localized in the same domain of the plasma membrane from which the viruses bud. Previous studies have shown that influenza HA and VSV G proteins, when expressed from cloned cDNAs, are accumulated preferentially on the proper domains (apical and basolateral, respectively), indicating that the signal(s) for polarized transport resides in the polypeptide backbone of the proteins. To further elucidate the structural features required for apical vs. basolateral transport, we have constructed a gene that encodes a chimeric protein (H1GA) containing the external domain of HA and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of VSV G. When the chimeric protein (H1GA) is expressed in CV1 cells using a simian virus 40 late expression vector, it is transported to the cell surface with kinetics similar to that of the native HA protein. Further, the chimeric protein, when expressed in polarized MDCK cells using a vaccinia virus early expression vector, is transported only to the apical surface, suggesting that the ectodomain of HA contains a signal for apical transport.\r"

Exposure to angiotensin II was accompanied by a rapid and substantial decrease in the phospholipid precursor, phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4,5-bisphosphate with only a slight and transient increase in the level of the biologically active product, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3), to a peak at about 5 sec. Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins-1,3,4-P3), the putative metabolite of Ins-1,4,5-P3, was also formed rapidly and maintained an elevated steady-state level during stimulation by angiotensin II. Inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Ins-1,4-P2) exhibited a simultaneous and prominent increase that could not be accounted for solely by direct breakdown of PtdIns 4-phosphate, indicating that large amounts of Ins-1,4,5-P3 must also have been produced and metabolized. The rapid formation of a substantial amount of inositol 4-monophosphate (Ins-4-P), with no significant change in the level of inositol 1-monophosphate (Ins-1-P) during the first minute of stimulation, was a notable feature of the glomerulosa cell response to angiotensin II. These observations indicate that PtdIns-4,5-P2 catabolism in the angiotensin-stimulated glomerulosa cell initially proceeds via Ins-1,4,5-P3 through Ins-1,3,4-P3 and Ins-1,4-P2 to form Ins-4-P rather than Ins-1-P and that direct hydrolysis of PtdIns by phospholipase C does not occur during the initial phase of angiotensin action. In glomerulosa cells stimulated by angiotensin II in the presence of Li+, the progressive accumulation of both Ins-4-P, and after a short lag period, Ins-1-P indicated that dephosphorylation of both isomers was inhibited by Li+. The increase of Ins-P isomers in the presence of Li+ was associated with increased and progressive accumulation of Ins-1,4-P2 and Ins-1,3,4-P3 but not of Ins-1,4,5-P3. These data demonstrate that sustained and massive breakdown of PtdIns phosphates begins within seconds during cell activation by angiotensin II. The Ca2+-mobilizing metabolite, Ins-1,4,5-P3, is rapidly converted to Ins-1,3,4-P3 and degraded through Ins-1,4-P2 and Ins-4-P, in contrast to the previous view that conversion to Ins-1-P is the major route of PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with the production of a viral envelope particle that contains membrane lipids, surface antigen (S), and two presurface-antigens (pre-S) comprised of the entire S moiety with approximately 55 (pre-S2) and 174 (pre-S1) additional NH2-terminal amino acids. We show here that Xenopus oocytes injected with synthetic S mRNA assemble and secrete characteristic 22-nm viral envelope particles. In contrast, pre-S1 and pre-S2 antigens are synthesized but not secreted. By coinjecting mRNAs, we found that synthesis of high levels of pre-S proteins specifically inhibits S antigen secretion. On the other hand, high levels of S synthesis can drive the secretion of small amounts of either pre-S antigen. These observations are consistent with a model for viral envelope assembly in which both S and pre-S proteins are incorporated into a multimeric particle, presumably via interactions between the S protein domains, while the pre-S amino-terminal moieties regulate the secretion of this structure. Our results indicate that Xenopus oocytes will provide a powerful system for studying the morphogenesis of simple structures of viral or cellular origin.\r"

Nuclear run-on assays were used to show that growth hormone regulation is manifested in part at the transcriptional level. Growth hormone also affects the size distribution of hepatic IGF-I mRNAs.

We now show that a part of the 434 repressor, the amino-terminal domain, activates leftward transcription when bound to OR2. We show that 434 repressor bound to OR2 closely approaches (touches) RNA polymerase bound to the leftward promoter. Model building based on ethylation interference and other experiments suggests that in three cases, those involving lambda repressor, 434 repressor, and bacteriophage P22 repressor, and in spite of differences in detailed arrangements, transcription is activated by a contact between the repressor and the same part of RNA polymerase.\r"

  ".W": "A functionalized derivative of the alpha 2-selective antagonist rauwolscine formed the basis for a photoaffinity adduct that has allowed identification of the hormone-binding subunit of the brain alpha 2-adrenergic receptor protein. Rauwolscine carboxylate underwent reaction with 4-N-t-butyloxycarbonyl-aminoaniline, leading to the synthesis of rauwolscine 4-aminophenyl carboxamide (Rau-AmPC). Rau-AmPC was radioiodinated and converted to the arylazide derivative, 17 alpha-hydroxy-20 alpha-yohimban-16 beta-[N-(4-azido-3-[125I]iodo)phenyl] carboxamide (125I-Rau-AzPC), via a diazonium salt intermediate. The characterization of 125I-Rau-AzPC as a photolabile probe employed alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, which were first solubilized from porcine brain membranes and partially purified by affinity chromatography utilizing a yohimbine-agarose affinity matrix. In the partially purified receptor preparation incubated with 125I-Rau-AzPC, photolysis resulted in covalent labeling of a major (Mr, 62,000) peptide as determined by NaDodSO4/PAGE and autoradiography. Labeling of this peptide was inhibited by the alpha 2-selective antagonist, yohimbine, and the non-subtype-selective alpha-antagonist, phentolamine, but not by the alpha 1-antagonist, prazosin, or the beta-receptor antagonist, (-)-alprenolol. The alpha-adrenergic agonist epinephrine also inhibited labeling in a stereoselective manner. These data indicate that the photolabeled Mr 62,000 peptide is the hormone-binding subunit of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor protein. The availability of this radioiodinated photoaffinity probe for the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor should facilitate further structural and biophysical characterization of the receptor protein.\r"

The carriers' erythrocytes tend to sickle at O2 partial pressures similar to those that induce sickling in Hb S/C disease. Pure deoxy-Hb S Antilles is 50% as soluble as deoxy-Hb S (saturating concentration = 11 g X dl-1 compared to 18.4 for Hb S). Dilute solutions of pure Hb S Antilles have a lower oxygen affinity than those of Hb A or Hb S (partial pressure for 50% binding is 9 mm Hg compared to 5.5 mm Hg for Hb A or S at pH 7.00). A/S Antilles erythrocytes have a much lower oxygen affinity than A/S cells; this is further decreased in dense cells fractionated on a Percoll density gradient. Their oxygen equilibrium curves had anomalous shapes like those of S/S cells. Fiber formation in the erythrocytes of Hb S Antilles carriers is clearly due to its low solubility and oxygen affinity, showing that heterozygosity for this hemoglobin presents another sickle cell syndrome and suggesting that Hb S heterozygotes who exhibit symptoms of sickle cell disease should be carefully screened for double mutations.\r"

The latter effect has been invoked as an explanation for behavioral tolerance in alcoholics, but the molecular basis for membrane tolerance is obscure. To study the molecular mechanisms of this acquired resistance to disordering, we fed rats ethanol (36% of total calories) for 35 days, after which we quantitatively separated the phospholipids of hepatic microsomal membranes by high-performance liquid chromatography. Multilamellar vesicles were prepared from the recombined phospholipid classes, and their physical properties were examined by electron spin resonance. Vesicles composed of phospholipids from untreated rats were disordered (fluidized) in the presence of ethanol, whereas those made from phospholipids of ethanol-fed rats were resistant to this effect. When phosphatidylcholine (66.5 mol %), phosphatidylethanolamine (21 mol %), or phosphatidylserine (4.0 mol %) from ethanol-fed rats replaced their corresponding phospholipids in vesicles prepared from microsomal phospholipids from untreated rats, the membranes were still disordered by ethanol. In contrast, when 2.5-8.5 mol % phosphatidylinositol from ethanol-fed rats replaced phosphatidylinositol from untreated rats, the reconstituted membranes were rendered resistant to ethanol-induced disordering. Liver microsomal phosphatidylinositol (2.5-8.5 mol %) from ethanol-fed rats also conferred membrane tolerance to vesicles composed of bovine liver and brain phospholipids, an effect which demonstrates that the ability of phosphatidylinositol to confer membrane tolerance is not restricted to the microsomal membrane.\r"

The 1198-base-pair fibroblast clone has been sequenced. The encoded protein is highly acidic (54 residues out of 111) and shares greater than 90% sequence homology with rat prothymosin alpha. The peptide \"hormone\" thymosin alpha 1 appears at positions 2-29 of the prothymosin alpha amino acid sequence. There is no N-terminal signal peptide. Examination of mouse and human tissues revealed the presence of prothymosin alpha mRNA in kidney, liver, spleen, normal lymphocytes (predominantly T cells), human T-cell leukemia virus-infected T cells, and myeloma cells (B-cell lineage). Prothymosin alpha mRNA is inducible; upon mitogen stimulation it increased greater than 15-fold above the level found in resting lymphocytes. Similarly, serum-deprived NIH 3T3 cells responded to serum restitution with an increase in prothymosin alpha mRNA. Characterization of human genomic DNA by Southern blot analysis disclosed a complicated pattern consistent with genetic polymorphism. These data suggest that prothymosin alpha plays an intracellular role tied to cell proliferation. There is no evidence that it serves as a precursor for secreted thymic peptides. However, given the complexity at the genomic level, multiple functions, including a putative secretory capability, cannot be excluded.\r"

  ".U": "87092261\r", 
  ".W": "Prolonged exposure of cells or tissues to drugs or hormones such as catecholamines leads to a state of refractoriness to further stimulation by that agent, known as homologous desensitization. In the case of the beta-adrenergic receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase, this process has been shown to be intimately associated with the sequestration of the receptors from the cell surface through a cAMP-independent process. Recently, we have shown that homologous desensitization in the frog erythrocyte model system is also associated with increased phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor. We now provide evidence that the phosphorylation state of the beta-adrenergic receptor regulates its functional coupling to adenylate cyclase, subcellular translocation, and recycling to the cell surface during the process of agonist-induced homologous desensitization. Moreover, we show that the receptor phosphorylation is reversed by a phosphatase specifically associated with the sequestered subcellular compartment. At 23 degrees C, the time courses of beta-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation, sequestration, and adenylate cyclase desensitization are identical, occurring without a lag, exhibiting a t1/2 of 30 min, and reaching a maximum at approximately 3 hr. Upon cell lysis, the sequestered beta-adrenergic receptors can be partially recovered in a light membrane vesicle fraction that is separable from the plasma membranes by differential centrifugation. The increased beta-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation is apparently reversed in the sequestered vesicle fraction as the sequestered receptors exhibit a phosphate/receptor stoichiometry that is similar to that observed under basal conditions. High levels of a beta-adrenergic receptor phosphatase activity appear to be associated with the sequestered vesicle membranes. The functional activity of the phosphorylated beta-adrenergic receptor was examined by reconstituting purified receptor with its biochemical effector the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ns) in phospholipid vesicles and assessing the receptor-stimulated GTPase activity of Ns. Compared to controls, phosphorylated beta-adrenergic receptors, purified from desensitized cells, were less efficacious in activating the Ns GTPase activity. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor leads to its functional uncoupling and physical translocation away from the cell surface into a sequestered membrane domain. In the sequestered compartment, the phosphorylation is reversed thus enabling the receptor to recycle back to the cell surface and recouple with adenylate cyclase.\r"

The relative paucity of detailed three-dimensional structural information available for these molecules has led to attempts to predict the secondary structures of membrane proteins based on folding motifs found in soluble proteins of known three-dimensional structure and sequence. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of several of these methods in predicting the conformation of 15 integral membrane proteins and membrane-spanning polypeptides for which both primary and secondary structural information are available. chi 2 analyses indicated a less than 0.5% correlation between the net predicted secondary structures and the experimental results. A more stringent test of the accuracy of the methods, the index of prediction, was calculated for individual residues in four of the polypeptides for which the crystal structures were known; this criterion also indicated that the predicted assignments for the secondary structures of the residues were inaccurate. Thus, prediction schemes using soluble protein bases appear to be inappropriate for the prediction of membrane protein folding.\r"

When crude extracts from each tissue were incubated at 55 degrees C, epidermal OrnDCase was rapidly inactivated, but the papilloma OrnDCase was more heat stable. Each of five individual papilloma extracts contained OrnDCase activity that was considerably more resistant to heat inactivation than was epidermal OrnDCase. Mixing of a papilloma and epidermal extract produced an intermediate heat-inactivation profile, suggesting that the differences in OrnDCase heat stability are not due to non-OrnDCase components of the extracts. Kinetic analyses indicated that the papilloma OrnDCase has an altered affinity for its substrate, L-ornithine, compared to epidermal OrnDCase. The apparent Km for L-ornithine for the epidermal enzyme was 0.07 mM while the Km values for the individual papilloma OrnDCases clustered around two higher values, 0.3 mM and 1.0 mM. The papilloma OrnDCases, but not epidermal OrnDCase, were activated by GTP and to a lesser extent by CTP. Immunoblot analysis showed the existence of multiple forms of OrnDCase in both epidermis and papilloma that differed in isoelectric point but not subunit molecular weight. None of the species of OrnDCase present in the epidermal extract coincided with the species present in papilloma. These results suggest that one consequence of neoplastic transformation in this in vivo system is the presence of an OrnDCase protein in benign tumors that differs structurally and functionally from the OrnDCase present in normal epidermis. The possible mechanisms responsible for these results and their significance for neoplastic development in this tissue are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Three types of metabolic control of oxidative metabolism are observed in the various tissues that have been studied by phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The principal control of oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle is by ADP (or Pi/phosphocreatine). This conclusion is based upon studies of arm muscles of humans during steady-state exercise. A work-cost (Vm vs. Pi/phosphocreatine) relationship follows a Michaelis-Menten rectangular hyperbola, where Km values from 0.5 to 0.6 and Vmax values from 50 to 200 (at nearly constant pH) are found in linearized plots of the equation V/Vmax = 1/(1 + 0.6 phosphocreatine/Pi) where V is work level (which is equal to the velocity of the enzymatic reaction) and Vmax is the maximal work capacity that is a measure of the enzyme activity (E) of oxidative metabolism. Adaptation to exercise enhances the slope of the work-cost relationship and causes large changes in Vmax or E. A second metabolic control may enhance the slope of the work-cost relationship but not Vmax. For example, the initiation of exercise can lead to an improved characteristic that can be explained by 2-fold increased substrate delivery, for example, increased oxygen delivery by microcirculatory control. Cardiac tissue of the adult dog affords an example of optimal endurance performance adaptation and exhibits the steepest work-cost relationship observed and is attributed to a coordinated control of substrate delivery that may involve Ca2+ and inorganic phosphate control of NADH; control of O2 delivery may also be involved. The calculated work-cost relationship is similar to that observed in the beagle heart. The theoretical curve illustrates that the liability of multiple controls is a sharp break point in metabolic control at the end of the multiple control range--a possible cause of instability of cardiac performance at high V/Vmax.\r"

One set acts to stabilize the network in its current memory state, while the second set, whose action is delayed in time, causes the network to make specified transitions between the memories. The dynamic properties of these networks are described in terms of motion along an energy surface. The performance of the networks, both with intact connections and with noisy or missing connections, is illustrated by numerical examples.

Using IAEDANS-labeled myosin as fluorescence donor and IAF-labeled myosin as acceptor, thick filament formation was followed by the decrease in donor fluorescence at 0.1 M KCl/10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.9. The critical concentration of myosin--i.e., that concentration that remained unassembled at equilibrium with fully formed filaments--was 40 nM. In FET and 125I-labeled myosin incorporation assays, extensive exchange of myosin between thick filaments was observed. The presence of a critical concentration and the measurements of extensive exchange suggest a dynamic equilibrium between fully polymerized myosin and a small pool of soluble myosin.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatocytes take up a variety of ligands via receptor-mediated endocytosis, yet little is known regarding either the volume of fluid or the amount of membrane internalized via endocytosis in liver cells. In these studies, we have utilized radiolabeled inulin to characterize fluid phase endocytosis by rat hepatocytes in primary culture and perfused rat liver. Uptake of inulin by cultured hepatocytes was nonlinear with time, occurring most rapidly during the first 2 min. Inulin uptake and efflux in cultured hepatocytes and inulin uptake by perfused rat liver were kinetically compatible with the entry of inulin into a rapidly (t1/2, 1-2 min) turning-over (presumably endosomal) compartment that exchanged contents with the extracellular space and comprised approximately 3% of hepatocyte volume, as well as entry into and concentration of inulin within slowly (t1/2, greater than 1 hr) turning-over storage compartments. Based on inulin uptake, it is estimated that cultured hepatocytes endocytosed the equivalent of 20% or more of their volume and 5 or more times their plasma membrane surface area each hour. Neither chloroquine (1 mM) nor taurocholate (200 microM) affected inulin handling by cultured cells, whereas colchicine (10 microM) inhibited transfer to storage compartments by greater than 50%. In conjunction with our previous observations, the present findings suggest that inulin endocytosed across the basolateral membrane is largely (congruent to 80%) regurgitated back into plasma, with smaller amounts transported to intracellular storage compartments (congruent to 18%) or to bile (congruent to 2%). Transport of inulin via these pathways is unaffected by taurocholate and does not require vesicle acidification, whereas intact microtubular function is required for transfer to storage compartments or biliary secretion.\r"

In this manuscript, the phosphorylation of human chorionic gonadotropin, a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the JAR choriocarcinoma cell line, is described. Labeling of JAR cells with 32PO4 indicates that both the intracellular and the secreted forms of the free alpha subunit are phosphorylated. Although the secreted alpha beta dimer also incorporates 32PO4, there is little detectable phosphorylation of the intracellular precursors of alpha beta dimer, suggesting that dimer phosphorylation occurs as a late event in post-translational processing. In addition, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate markedly stimulates the phosphorylation of both intracellular and secreted forms of free alpha subunit and to a lesser extent of secreted alpha beta dimer. In vitro assays, using homogenates of JAR cells as a source of protein kinase activity, indicate that the uncombined alpha subunit is preferentially phosphorylated. The phosphorylation sites are on serine and threonine residues in the alpha subunit.\r"

  ".W": "The multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase purified from rat brain cytosol undergoes an intramolecular self-phosphorylation or autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation produces two strikingly different effects on kinase activity that are dependent on the level of ATP used in the reaction. At low but saturating levels of ATP (5 microM), autophosphorylation causes a 75% reduction in kinase activity, with the residual activity still retaining a dependence on Ca2+ and calmodulin. By contrast, at high but physiological levels of ATP (500 microM), the kinase is converted by autophosphorylation to a form that is autonomous of Ca2+ and calmodulin, with no accompanying reduction in activity. The extent of phosphate incorporation does not determine whether the kinase becomes inhibited or autonomous. Autophosphorylated kinase shows the functional change characteristic of the ATP concentration used during the reaction--inhibited at low ATP and autonomous at high ATP--even when compared at the same level of incorporated phosphate. ATP appears to regulate the site(s) phosphorylated during activation of the kinase and thereby modulates the dual effects of autophosphorylation. Events triggered by transient elevations of cellular Ca2+ may be potentiated and retained by generation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-independent protein kinase activity.\r"

The proximal region, -72 to -32, is recognized as a common enhancing signal by all B. mori extracts from the posterior silk gland, the middle silk gland, the ovarian tissue, and an embryonic cell line. It is weakly recognized by an Antheraea silkworm cell line extract but not by a HeLa cell extract. The distal region, -238 to -73, appears to be a tissue-specific enhancing signal that is recognized more effectively by the posterior silk gland extract than by the middle silk gland extract. These observations suggest that the use of these cell-free systems can offer a means for the biochemical characterization of the trans-acting factors involved in the tissue-specific regulation of the fibroin gene.\r"

In addition to lipids, surfactant contains apoproteins that are thought to be critical for normal surfactant function. We have examined the ontogeny and regulation of the major surfactant-associated protein of molecular mass 28-36 kDa (SP 28-36) in human fetal lung. SP 28-36 was not detected in tissue from second trimester abortuses by either immunoblot analysis or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (less than 0.02 microgram per mg of DNA). Levels of mRNA for SP 28-36, assayed by cDNA hybridization, were low or undetectable in all preculture specimens. The concentration of saturated phosphatidylcholine in lung tissue was 30% of the adult value with no apparent increase between 15 and 24 weeks gestation. SP 28-36 content increased during explant culture in the absence of serum and hormones, exceeding adult levels (3.2 +/- 1.0 micrograms per mg of DNA) after 5 days. In cultures treated with triiodothyronine (2 nM) and dexamethasone (10 nM), hormones that regulate phosphatidylcholine synthesis, the increase in SP 28-36 was accelerated (treated/control ratio was 7.1 and 3.4 at 3 and 5 days, respectively). Levels of mRNA for SP 28-36 also increased during culture and were stimulated by hormones (treated/control = 8.6 and 1.9 at 3 and 5 days, respectively). SP 28-36 and its mRNA increased similarly in the presence of dexamethasone alone, whereas triiodothyronine alone had no apparent effect. The molecular weight and charge pattern was similar for SP 28-36 of adult and cultured fetal tissue. These findings indicate that expression of the SP 28-36 gene is low during the second trimester, increases during explant culture, and is accelerated by glucocorticoid treatment.\r"

A fusion protein containing the Hox 1.5 homeo domain constructed in lambda gt11 also binds the same 753-bp DNA fragment. Specific binding of the fusion protein to the upstream DNA fragment shows that the homeo box contains the sequences required for specific protein-DNA interactions, and the 753-bp fragment contains a homeo domain binding site. These results support the hypothesis that murine homeo boxes are DNA binding domains of proteins involved in the regulation of embryonic development.\r"

  ".W": "Murine embryonal carcinoma F9 cells, which do not express appreciable levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I mRNA, start to express the mRNA and proteins upon differentiation induced by retinoic acid (RA). To investigate the molecular mechanism of this regulation, we examined in F9 cells transient expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene directed by the 5' flanking region of a MHC class I gene, H-2Ld. The native 1.4-kilobase H-2Ld 5' upstream region gave very low CAT activity in undifferentiated F9 cells. Deletion between positions -210 and -135 relative to the cap site resulted in a 4- to 5-fold increase in CAT activity as compared with constructs containing the region. However, all of these constructs, regardless of the deletion, expressed comparable CAT activity in differentiated F9 cells. These data suggest the presence of a negative cis-acting element that is under developmental control. Further analysis revealed that the sequence conferring the negative regulation resides between positions -195 and -161. This region, highly conserved among the MHC class I genes, is found to be capable of increasing CAT activity in NIH 3T3 cells that express the class I genes constitutively. Further, this regulatory sequence, when connected to the simian virus 40 promoter, produced repressive and enhancing effects in F9 and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively. Based on these results, we suggest that the expression of MHC class I genes during development involves switching from negative to positive regulation dictated by the class I regulatory element located between positions -195 and -161.\r"

Mating behavior accomplishes the transfer of gametes and stimulates the coordination of reproductive activity of the male and female. Cnemidophorus uniparens, a parthenogenetic species, is believed to have resulted from the hybridization of two extant gonochoristic species, Cnemidophorus inornatus and Cnemidophorus gularis. C. uniparens regularly and reliably perform behaviors identical in form to those performed during mating by male C. inornatus. We have determined experimentally that individuals of the parthenogenetic species demonstrating male-like pseudosexual behavior also share a similarity in function with males of the sexually reproducing species. The number of female C. inornatus ovulating increases, and the latency to ovulation decreases, if a sexually active conspecific male is present. A similar facilitatory effect on ovarian recrudescence occurs in the all-female C. uniparens in the presence of a male-like individual. These results show that behavioral facilitation of ovarian recrudescence is important in sexual and unisexual species. This may represent a potent selection pressure favoring the maintenance of male-typical behaviors, thus accounting for the display of behavioral traits usually associated with males in unisexual species of hybrid origin.\r"

A lethal hit of approximately 85 acetylaminofluorene adducts per SV40 genome was calculated. UV irradiation of cells prior to infection did not modify the results. Molecular analysis of independent SV40 revertants showed that 2-(N-acetoxy-N-acetylamino)fluorene induces base substitutions that are located not opposite putative acetylaminofluorene adducts but next to them. Moreover, a hot spot of mutation restoring a true wild-type genotype was observed in 10 of the 16 revertants analyzed. This hot spot, not targeted opposite a major DNA lesion, was not observed using UV light as damaging agent in the same genetic assay. Two models involving the stabilization, by acetylaminofluorene adducts, of the secondary structure of a specific quasipalindromic SV40 sequence are proposed to explain this sequence-specific hot spot.\r"

From the known nucleotide sequence of the 16-kbp vaccinia HindIIID fragment, we identified a region that contains a 1896-base open reading frame coding for a 631-amino acid protein. Analysis of the complete sequence revealed a highly basic protein, with hydrophilic COOH and NH2 termini, various hydrophobic domains, and no significant homology to other known proteins.

The genotype of west Texas deer differs from that of O. virginianus from South Carolina by five mutational events (1.3% sequence divergence), whereas it differs from that of O. hemionus from California by 17 events (5.5% divergence).

Titration of the reaction with different proportions of homologous single-stranded DNA distinguished a condition under which the search for homology itself was rate limiting from a condition under which some later step was limiting. Less than 1 min was required to scan 6.4 kilobase pairs of duplex DNA for homology to a RecA-coated single strand of the same size, but these experiments revealed that rapid searching by RecA nucleoprotein filaments was largely confined to neighboring duplex molecules. These observations provide guidelines for the use of RecA protein in locating rare sequences in complex mixtures of duplex DNA, and we describe a simple protocol by which rare sequences can be rapidly enriched at least a thousandfold.\r"

Biotinylated linear DNA probes coated with RecA have been used to screen reconstituted plasmid libraries consisting of two plasmid species, one homologous and the other heterologous to the probe. When the link between biotin and the nucleotide base could be cleaved by reducing agents, the complex was purified by streptavidin-agarose chromatography and the recovered plasmid was propagated in Escherichia coli. When the link was not cleavable the complex was bound to avidin in solution and purified by cupric iminodiacetic acid-agarose chromatography. The complex was then dissociated and the plasmids were propagated in E. coli. With either protocol, homologous plasmid recovery was between 10% and 20%, and enrichment was between 10(4)- and 10(5)-fold. Potential applications and extensions of this method, such as plasmid, cosmid, and phage library screening and facilitation of physical mapping of macroregions of mammalian genomes are presented and discussed.\r"

Allelic variants exist at both C gamma 1 and C gamma 2 loci in coding regions (as well as in restriction enzyme sites). Both C gamma genes are in the same transcriptional orientation. Moreover, the organization of the nonallelic C gamma genes reveals some interesting features: the C gamma 1 gene, like the mouse C gamma gene, has three exons, whereas the C gamma 2 gene has four exons, including a duplicated second exon that would create a putative protein with an enlarged constant region. However, these two duplicated exons in C gamma 2 have lost the cysteine residue that is thought to be involved in the interchain disulfide bridge.\r"

We show BALB/c-H-2dm2 mice do not transcribe detectable levels of Ld mRNA, indicating they do not produce a truncated Ld molecule as previously reported. Furthermore, in Southern blot comparisons using a series of low-copy genomic probes, the deletion was found to be approximately 140 kilobases and include the entire Ld gene along with three or more other class I genes mapping between Dd and Ld. These data represent direct genetic evidence for a spontaneous contraction in the genes encoding class I histocompatibility antigens, which in this case probably resulted from the misalignment of the 3' flanking regions of the Dd and Ld genes.\r"

Alleles were defined as distinct combinations of the presence or absence of polymorphic restriction sites within each locus. The 28 loci included 13 genes encoding proteins, 10 genes specifying tRNAs, 2 genes specifying rRNAs, and 3 noncoding regions consisting of the D loop, the light strand origin of replication, and the 5' noncoding sequence. In 35 comparisons of allele frequency distributions to expected distributions predicted by neutral mutation theory (assuming an infinite alleles model), the results revealed that most genetic diversity values (71%) fell within the range predicted by the neutral model; however, excesses in the frequencies of common alleles and in the number of singleton alleles within populations were observed at specific loci. Departures from the neutral mutation model are most readily explained by the effects of the recent expansion of the human population and the action of purifying selection. Coefficients of population differentiation suggest that gene flow of mtDNA types between certain geographic regions may be limited.\r"

AS52 cells contain a single functional copy of a bacterial gene, the xanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (gpt) gene instead of its mammalian equivalent, the hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene. We found that x-ray and neutron irradiations are equally toxic to both cell types; however, these physical agents are approximately equal to 10 times more mutagenic to AS52 cells than to K1-BH4 cells. Our earlier studies using Southern blot analysis showed that x-irradiation produces mostly or exclusively deletion mutations in both cell types. If reactive oxygen species mediate the mutagenic effects of radiations and chemicals, then radiomimetic compounds such as streptonigrin and bleomycin, which exert their biological effects via reactive oxygen species, and oxidizing compounds such as potassium superoxide and hydrogen peroxide should elicit a similar differential mutagenic response in both cell types. On the other hand, agents such as ethyl methanesulfonate, ICR 191, and UV light, which do not produce reactive oxygen species, should not elicit differential mutagenicity. Our results fulfill such predictions. The apparent hypermutability of AS52 cells probably results from a higher recovery of multilocus deletion mutants in AS52 cells than in K1-BH4 cells, rather than a higher yield of induced mutants.\r"

The DHFR cDNA product is 270-fold more resistant to MTX than the wild-type enzyme. Seventeen transgenic mouse lines, identified by Southern blotting of tail or spleen DNA, carried between 1 and 400 copies of the foreign gene per cell. Eight lines have thus far been tested for resistance to MTX. Control mice were treated until death; MTX was withdrawn from transgenic mice when a cumulative MTX dose uniformly fatal for controls was reached. The major site of MTX toxicity was the gastrointestinal tract, with death of controls resulting from fluid and weight loss. Transgenic animals were relatively resistant to these symptoms and tolerated significantly more MTX than control animals. These results show that genes conferring resistance to chemotherapeutic agents can, after transfer into intact organisms, produce systemic drug resistance.\r"

To evade such immune surveillance viruses may have evolved various strategies to manipulate the expression of class I antigens. Adenovirus 2 manufactures an early glycoprotein, E19, that binds to nascent class I antigens in the endoplasmic reticulum and impedes their transport to the cell surface. We now show that adenoviruses typical of all viral subgenera except the highly oncogenic subgenus A dramatically reduce the cell-surface expression of class I antigens. It has been shown that subgenus A viruses abolish class I antigen expression in transformed cells by reducing mRNA levels. Thus, all adenoviruses can modulate the cell-surface expression of class I antigens.\r"

Moreover, the chicken mannose-binding proteins cross-reacted with gamma-chain-specific antibody against chicken IgG. The binding proteins were identified as IgGs by several other criteria: identical electrophoresis pattern when subjected to reducing and nonreducing NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cochromatography on a Fractogel TSK HW-55(F) column, similar amino acid composition, and isolation of mannose-binding protein from purified serum IgG at a yield comparable to whole serum.

By immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry, cells from four of six Ad2- and Ad5-transformed hamster and mouse lines expressed high levels of cell-surface class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, while cells from two of these six lines expressed low levels of cell-surface class I MHC antigens. The levels of class I MHC proteins expressed by cells from these latter two lines were comparable to the levels of cell-surface class I MHC proteins expressed by cells from Ad12-transformed hamster and mouse lines. Moreover, an Ad2-transformed line that had become highly oncogenic after in vivo adaptation showed the same high level of MHC expression as the nononcogenic parent. The amounts of class I mRNA, analyzed by RNA blotting, were, in general, consistent with the levels of class I antigens expressed on the surfaces of these cells. These results indicate that there is no correlation between the tumorigenicity in immunocompetent syngeneic adult rodents of Ad2- and Ad5-transformed hamster and mouse cells and the level of class I MHC antigens expressed on the surfaces of these cells. Thus, the expression of different levels of class I MHC proteins does not seem to explain the differences in the oncogenicity between nononcogenic and highly oncogenic human Ad serotypes.\r"

The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (10 microM), the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor methylisobutylxanthine (100 microM), dibutyryl-cAMP (10 microM), histamine (10 microM), and PMA (0.1 microM) significantly altered the morphology of human aortic and umbilical vein endothelial cells in primary cultures. These effects reached a maximum 40-80 min after the effector addition and became negligible 30-60 min after its removal. PMA and forskolin were strongly synergistic in altering endothelial cell morphology. All the effects of cAMP-elevating compounds and of PMA were abolished completely by 1 microM colchicine. In explants taken from human adult or child aortas, forskolin and PMA produced alterations in endothelial morphology qualitatively identical to those observed in endothelial cell cultures. Endothelium in these preparations closely resembled that found in zones of expected altered hemodynamic stresses of human aorta. Our data suggest that the morphology of endothelium in vivo may be regulated by separate or synergistic action of hormone-dependent adenylate cyclase and of inositol phospholipid turnover systems and might be important for maintenance of endothelial monolayer integrity under normal physiological and pathological conditions.\r"

We examined whether the shorter 18-amino acid peptide h beta MSH-(5-22) could be detected in some human tissues. Normal human pituitaries and hypothalami as well as corticotropin-secreting pituitary and nonpituitary tumors were extracted and chromatographed on Sephadex G-50, and the fractions were measured with two radioimmunoassays using either a COOH-terminal human gamma LPH (h gamma LPH) antiserum that recognized equally h gamma LPH, h beta MSH, and h beta MSH-(5-22) or a mid-portion h gamma LPH antiserum that recognized h gamma LPH and h beta MSH but not h beta MSH-(5-22). Normal pituitaries and pituitary tumors contained a single immunoreactive material coeluting with h gamma LPH. The hypothalami and the nonpituitary tumors all contained h gamma LPH and a smaller molecular weight material that was only detected in the COOH-terminal h gamma LPH radioimmunoassay; its elution volume (Ve/V, 0.75) was identical to that of h beta MSH-(5-22) but different from that of h beta MSH (Ve/V, 0.60); on reversed-phase HPLC, it coeluted with synthetic h beta MSH-(5-22) with a retention time different from that of h beta MSH. It is concluded that h beta MSH-(5-22) that corresponds to the 18-amino acid peptide h beta LPH-(39-56), flanked by two pairs of basic amino acids within the h beta LPH molecule, is a normal maturation product of proopiomelanocortin in human nonpituitary tissues.\r"

  ".U": "87092330\r", 
  ".W": "During the first 2 postnatal weeks, up to 50% of the ganglion cells in the mammalian retina normally die. Natural cell death may result from several factors, and electrical activity has been proposed as one critical element. Recent experiments in vivo using intraocular injection of tetrodotoxin (TTX) have suggested that competition for survival between ganglion cells from the two eyes is mediated by their degree of neuronal activity. In addition, the level of activity of afferents to the ganglion cells has been postulated to be an important variable in determining their survival. To investigate the mechanism of cell death engendered by altered activity, I studied the effect of electrical blockade with TTX (to block sodium channels and thus action potentials) or low Ca/high Mg (to block transmitter release and hence synaptic activity) on individual neurons in vitro. For this purpose, identified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from postnatal rats were maintained in culture. Unlike the previous in vivo experiments, this approach permitted the exact concentration of each agent to be controlled and the electrical activity of the RGCs to be recorded. In cultures from animals of postnatal day 2-10 (P2-10), 1 microM TTX or 0.2 mM Ca/20 mM Mg resulted in the death of about 50% of the RGCs, representing those cells that had displayed spontaneous electrical activity, but did not affect RGCs that lacked activity. However, the death of RGCs with spontaneous activity from P11-13 animals was not influenced by these drugs. These findings suggest that during a critical period of development neurons become dependent upon electrical activity, and the cessation of this activity can result in their death. In addition, conditioned medium, collected from cultures lacking TTX, rescued from death a large proportion of TTX-treated RGCs. Thus, the critical element for survival may represent modulation of a trophic factor related to the level of activity rather than electrical activity itself. Since, in vivo, natural cell death occurs in neurons of similar type and age, and in the same proportion as that induced by the artificial blockade of electrical activity in culture, these findings may be germane to the mechanism of natural cell death in the retina.\r"

We have utilized cell culture of individual neurons of Aplysia to demonstrate the release of the neuropeptides SCPA and SCPB (small cardioactive peptides A and B). Neurons B1 and B2 were isolated from the buccal ganglion of Aplysia and maintained in cell culture. The cells grew new processes, which were immunoreactive to antibodies for the neuropeptide SCPB. These processes contained SCPA and SCPB that were detectable by bioassay on snail heart. The cells synthesized the SCPs from radiolabeled precursors and transported the peptides to their neurites. Single cells released SCPs in a calcium-dependent fashion upon intracellular electrical stimulation. Taken together, these results provide critical evidence that SCPs are neurotransmitters. The results also indicate that the cell culture of individual identified neurons can be used to investigate the release of peptides.\r"

  ".W": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been shown to be a neurotransmitter in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Although 5-HT is a mediator of slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked by stimulation of interganglionic connectives, the precise role it plays in the physiology of the gut is unclear. Research has been hampered by an inadequate knowledge of the types of 5-HT receptor in the ENS and thus the lack of well-characterized antagonists. We now report the identification of two classes of enteric neural 5-HT receptor, the effects of activating these receptors on myenteric type II/AH neurons, and their characterization with specific agonists and antagonists. One class, which we propose to call 5-HT1P, is characterized by a high affinity for [3H]5-HT in radioligand binding assays. This class of receptor mediates a slow depolarization of myenteric type II/AH neurons associated with an increase in input resistance. Agonists at this receptor include, in addition to 5-HT (in order of potency), 5- and 6-hydroxyindalpine and 2-methyl-5-HT. 5-HT1P-mediated responses are specifically antagonized by 5-hydroxytryptophyl-5-hydroxytryptophan amide. The other class of 5-HT receptor, which we propose to call 5-HT2P, appears not to have a high affinity for [3H]5-HT. This receptor mediates a brief depolarization of myenteric II/AH neurons associated with a fall in input resistance. 2-Methyl-5-HT, at low concentrations, is a specific agonist at this receptor and ICS 205-930 is a specific antagonist. Binding of [3H]5-HT to enteric membranes is inhibited by 5-HT1P receptor agonists and antagonists but not by the 5-HT2P receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 or by MDL 72222, another compound reported to be an antagonist of 5-HT at peripheral receptors.\r"

TyrOHase was quantified by an immunoblot assay using purified rat TyrOHase as the standard. Treatment of ovariectomized animals with progesterone, but not estradiol, resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of TyrOHase in the median eminence. The in situ activity of the enzyme was assayed by measuring the rate of synthesis of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), and the results were expressed as mol of dopa per hr per mol of TyrOHase. In animals treated with both estradiol and progesterone for 3 days, the in situ activity of TyrOHase in the median eminence was 114 +/- 13.5 (mean +/- SEM) compared to 26 +/- 4.7 for the controls. Estradiol or progesterone alone was much less effective than was the combination of estradiol and progesterone. To ascertain whether the effect of estradiol and progesterone on TyrOHase activity was reflected in the secretion of dopamine into hypophyseal portal blood, ovariectomized rats were treated for 3 days with both estradiol and progesterone or with the solvent vehicle. The concentration of dopamine in portal plasma of the hormone-treated animals was 1.93 +/- 0.533 ng/ml compared to 0.34 +/- 0.094 ng/ml in vehicle-treated animals. We conclude that the quantity and in situ molar activity of TyrOHase in neurites of the median eminence as well as the secretion of dopamine from these neurites are modulated by the combined action of estradiol and progesterone.\r"

The entire nucleotide sequences of the exons and of the exon-intron transitions were determined, and the intron lengths were measured. Exon I includes only ATGG of the translated region, the N-terminal methionine codon and G of glycine, the first amino acid of mature PLP. Each hydrophobic trans- and cis-membrane domain of PLP together with its adjacent hydrophilic sequence correlates closely with one exon of the gene except for the C-terminal transmembrane helix that is encoded by two exons. The amino acid sequence of human PLP derived from the nucleic acid sequence is highly conserved. Human and rat PLP are completely homologous, whereas only four amino acid residues are exchanged in bovine PLP sequence derived from protein sequencing and a partial cDNA clone. Homology search on the nucleic acid level among human, bovine, and rat brain PLPs indicates an unusually high homology in the coding regions. Hybridization analysis with DNA of human-rodent hybrid clones revealed that the gene encoding PLP segregates with human X chromosome in the region q13-q22.\r"

Three different methods established that the structure of the Anthopleura RFamide peptide (Antho-RFamide) is pyroGlu-Gly-Arg-Phe-NH2. Comparison of synthetic and natural Antho-RFamide and their enzymatic breakdown products on six different HPLC columns confirmed the structure of the sea anemone peptide. Using synthetic Antho-RFamide as a standard in our radioimmunoassay, we measured high concentrations (3.2 nmol/g wet weight) of this peptide in extracts of Anthopleura.

  ".U": "87092340\r", 
  ".W": "In embryonic chicken brains, the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM is expressed mainly as two polypeptides, the large intracellular-domain polypeptide (ld) (Mr = 160,000) and the small intracellular-domain polypeptide (sd) (Mr = 130,000) chains, that differ in their cytoplasmic domains and that arise by alternative splicing of RNA transcribed from a single gene. There is evidence for a minor N-CAM polypeptide of Mr = 120,000 that is similar to the ld and sd chains for most of its amino-terminal sequence, but which lacks a cytoplasmic domain. We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone, lambda N151, that appears to encode this third N-CAM polypeptide, which we designate the ssd (small surface-domain) polypeptide chain. The cDNA insert of lambda N151 consists of 2437 base pairs (bp). DNA hybridization and sequencing indicate that the first 1721 bp are nearly identical to the corresponding sequences of clone lambda N208, which encodes the ld chain. Following in the same reading frame, lambda N151 encodes 25 amino acids not present in lambda N208. The rest of lambda N151 consists of a 637-bp noncoding region containing an AATACA polyadenylylation sequence and a 55-bp poly(A) tract. Messenger RNAs complementary to lambda N151 appear later in development than those complementary to the ld and sd chains, and their appearance is correlated with the appearance of the ssd polypeptide. Although the polypeptide encoded by lambda N151 lacks a membrane region that would define a cytoplasmic domain, it does contain at its carboxyl end a relatively hydrophobic stretch of amino acids similar to those seen in precursors of membrane proteins that are attached to membranes via the lipid phosphatidylinositol. We show here that the ssd chain of chicken N-CAM can be released from brain vesicles by treatment with phospholipase C, suggesting that it too may have a phosphatidylinositol anchor. These results define two additional modes by which N-CAM expression can be modulated: by RNA splicing at a new site and by differential membrane attachment of the resulting polypeptide through a lipid intermediate.\r"

The enkephalin-induced blocking action was antagonized by naloxone and appears to be mediated by delta-opiate receptors. Two different aspects of the blocking effect were detected, a resting block and a recovery from block during prolonged depolarizing pulses. Recovery from block was more complete, and its time course was more rapid, with depolarization to more positive potentials. The dose dependence of the type 2 channel block at rest indicated a one-to-one binding stoichiometry, with an apparent dissociation constant of 8.8 nM. Somatostatin exerted a similar selective blocking action on the type 2 Ca2+ channel. The time- and voltage-dependent block of type 2 Ca2+ channels may provide a mechanism underlying the enkephalinergic presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release and the somatostatin block of pituitary growth hormone release.\r"

To characterize the nature of this signal-anchor domain we have introduced single amino acid changes in this domain by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Three mutant NA proteins that were synthesized contained a single charged amino acid residue in place of a hydrophobic amino acid residue at position 11, 17, or 26 of the signal-anchor domain. When the altered NA proteins were expressed in CV-1 cells, two phenotypes were observed: substitution of arginine in place of glycine at position 11 and substitution of aspartic acid for valine at position 17 did not abolish the signal, the anchor, or the transport functions. On the other hand, substitution of arginine for isoleucine at position 26 blocked the migration of the NA protein from the Golgi complex to the cell surface. Double mutants were constructed from these single point mutations and they exhibited two phenotypes: one double mutant (aspartic acid at position 17 and arginine at position 26) was present mostly in the cytoplasm and the other (arginine at positions 11 and 26) was present mostly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that the hydrophobic amino acids at positions 11, 17, and 26 are required for intracellular transport. Furthermore, the accumulation of the mutant proteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus suggests the existence of putative intracellular transport (or traffic) signals in the signal-anchor domain of NA.\r"

The purified complex was largely comprised of the two cytochromes covalently attached at the interface of the functional electron transfer-effector complex as shown by the following evidence. The spin state of the LM2 within the complex was greater than the spin state of free LM2, and the addition of free cytochrome b5 (cyt b5) did not further increase the spin state of the LM2 within the complex. The spectral binding parameters (Kd and delta Amax) for the association of benzphetamine with LM2 in the complex were identical to those observed with free LM2 in the presence of saturating concentrations of free cyt b5 and much different from those observed for LM2 in the absence of cyt b5. Reconstituted monooxygenase activity of the covalent LM2-cyt b5 complex (LM2-cyt b5) in the presence of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase was much higher than the activity of free LM2 and approached the activity of free LM2 in the presence of optimal concentrations of free cyt b5. Furthermore, the Km for the flavoprotein in supporting either free LM2 or LM2-cyt b5-dependent p-nitroanisole demethylation were similar. (iv) Less than 20-25% of the cyt b5 within the complex could be reduced by free NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (NADH-cyt b5 reductase) albeit at a slow rate. The implications of this data to the current understanding of the mechanism and stoichiometry of protein interactions in the hepatic mixed function oxidase system are discussed.\r"

Controlled changes in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of microsomes were introduced either in intact cells by incubating fibroblast cultures with whole serum or lipoprotein-deficient serum or by enrichment or depletion of cholesterol in microsomal preparations by incubating microsomes with cholesterol-rich or cholesterol-poor egg phosphatidylcholine unilamellar vesicles. Cholesterol enrichment resulted in suppression of reductase activity and increased ESR order parameters for 12-nitroxystearate in the microsomal preparations. Conversely, cholesterol depletion caused an activation of reductase and a decrease in order parameter. Enrichment of microsomal preparations with a \"nonfluid\" lipid, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, also suppressed enzyme activity and increased membrane order. The effect was reversed by subsequent enrichment of the microsomes with fluid egg phosphatidylcholine. Our findings suggest that cholesterol may regulate its own biosynthesis, at least in part, by suppression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase mediated through changes in membrane fluidity as measured by ESR order parameter.\r"

In F1 hybrids of Philly and Swiss-Webster mice, cataracts appeared about 49 days following birth, approximately equal to 13 days later in development than in the Philly mice. In the Philly and hybrid mice, stage I and stage II were followed by stage III in which Tc reached a minimum value and then increased toward body temperature. The values of Tc at birth, the slope of the increase during stage I, and the maximum Tc were characteristic for each mouse strain. These results establish that the behavior of the temperature of the phase separation Tc in mouse lens is linked to the genetic strain of the mice and that the value of Tc at birth is an early indicator of lenses that will develop cataracts and lenses that will develop normally.\r"

  ".W": "When primary mouse mammary epithelial cells are cultured on plastic, they rapidly lose their ability to synthesize and secrete most milk proteins even in the presence of lactogenic hormones, whereas cells cultured on released type I collagen gels show greatly enhanced mRNA levels and secretion rates of beta-casein and of some other milk proteins. We show here that culture on a reconstituted basement membrane from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor (EHS) allows greater than 90% of cells to produce high levels of beta-casein. By comparison, 30-40% of cells on released type 1 gels and only 2-10% of cells on plastic express beta-casein after 6 days in culture. Because only 40% of cells from late pregnant gland produced beta-casein before culture, the EHS matrix can both induce and maintain an increased level of casein gene expression. Individual basal lamina components were also evaluated. Type IV collagen and fibronectin had little effect on morphology and beta-casein mRNA levels. In contrast, both laminin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan increased beta-casein mRNA levels (1.5- to 4-fold and 2- to 8-fold, respectively). However, for heparan sulfate proteoglycan, increased message was not accompanied by increased secretion of beta-casein. Profound morphological differences were evident between cells cultured on plastic and on EHS matrix, the latter cells forming ducts, ductules, and lumina and resembling secretory alveoli. These results emphasize the vital role of the extracellular matrix in receiving and integrating structural and functional signals that can direct specific gene expression in differentiated tissues.\r"

CAT activity is detected at the early blastula stage, when transcripts of the endogenous CyIIIa gene normally appear. Our measurements show that during activation the amount of CAT enzyme increases at least 100-fold; that there are present in late blastula stage embryos about 5 X 10(5) molecules of CAT mRNA (i.e., approximately 6 times the number of endogenous CyIIIa mRNAs); and that within the range studied the amount of CAT enzyme produced is independent of the number of CyIIIa-CAT genes incorporated per embryo, probably because the genes are present in excess of factors required for their activation. Activation of the CyIIIa-CAT construct is seriously inhibited, or abolished, by successive deletions of upstream CyIIIa sequences.\r"

Analysis of this molecule revealed it to be a highly underwound covalently closed circle. DNA unwinding was not detected with DNA containing a SV40 T-antigen binding site II mutation that renders the DNA inactive in replication. The unwinding reaction requires the action of a helicase, and SV40 T-antigen preparations contain such an activity. The T-antigen-associated ability to unwind DNA copurified with other activities intrinsic to T antigen [ability to support replication of SV40 DNA containing the SV40 origin, poly(dT)-stimulated ATPase activity, and DNA helicase]. However, in contrast to the unwinding activity, the SV40 T-antigen-associated helicase activity was not sequence-specific. A variety of labeled oligonucleotides hybridized with circular single-stranded DNA were displaced by T antigen in the presence of ATP.\r"

However, the plotted correlation slopes differ among various parts of the genome or among the first, second, and third positions of the codons depending on their functional importance. Facts suggest that biased mutation pressure, called A X T/G X C pressure, has affected whole DNA during evolution so as to determine the genomic G + C content in a given bacterium. The role of A X T/G X C pressure in diversification of bacterial DNA sequences and codon usage patterns is discussed in the perspective of the neutral theory of molecular evolution.\r"

This conservation (which implies functional selection) is broadly represented throughout the C-terminal portion of the human c-myc protein but is largely restricted to three clusters of amino acid sequences in the N-terminal region. We have examined the role that the latter three regions of the c-myc protein might play in the transforming function of the c-myc gene. Several mutations, deletions and frameshifts, were introduced into the c-myc gene, and these mutant genes were tested for their ability to collaborate with the EJ-ras oncogene to transform rat embryo fibroblasts. Complete elimination of the first two N-terminal conserved segments abolished transforming activity. In contrast, genes altered in a portion of the second or the entire third conserved segment retained their transforming activity. Thus, the latter two segments are not required for the transformation process, suggesting that they serve another function related only to the normal expression of the c-myc gene.\r"

One positive clone contained an insertion of a 612-base-pair fragment.

Additional 5' and 3' flanking sequences, absent on the pUC9 Sod2 clone, were obtained from a lambda gt11 clone isolated from a maize leaf library probed with the pUC9 Sod2 insert.

  ".W": "A class of mouse neoplasms termed Abelson virus-induced plasmacytoid lymphosarcomas has previously been found to express abnormal myb transcripts due to a helper virus insertion into the 5' end of the c-myb locus. We have established clonal cell lines from these tumors and have shown that they all express markers characteristic of myelomonocytic, rather than lymphoid, cells. Treatment of the plasmacytoid lymphosarcoma lines with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate led to various degrees of growth arrest, presumably due to myelomonocytic differentiation. To date, characterization of myeloid cell lines with varying responses to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate has not been reported. The different clonal plasmacytoid lymphosarcoma lines should, therefore, provide a good model to help elucidate the role of altered myb locus and other protooncogenes in myelomonocytic leukemia. Contrary to studies on induced differentiation of myelomonocytic cells with normal myb locus, our results on plasmacytoid lymphosarcoma cells indicate that reduced myb and myc expression may not be obligatory for growth arrest to occur. The present study, however, supports the previous notion that the myb transforming ability may be restricted to cells of the myelomonocytic lineage. In addition, we found that only the more mature cells can undergo prolonged phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced growth arrest, suggesting that the maintenance of these leukemic cells in their proliferative state, presumably by the myb gene product, can be overcome with appropriate differentiation signal(s).\r"

The clones have been sequenced and the sequences compared with published DR beta cDNA sequences derived from other haplotypes. A comparison of our sequences with other published cDNA sequences did not allow assignment of these other sequences to either the beta 1 or beta 2 locus. Comparison of our DR4 beta 1 sequence with DR beta 1 sequences isolated from other DR4-positive cells suggests that the alleles of DR4 beta 1 may have recently diverged from a common ancestor. The apparent lack of polymorphism of DR beta 2 may in part be a reflection of this recent divergence.\r"

Although the processed termini are separated by as much as 75 A in the native virus capsid, the fold and arrangement of polypeptide chains in a protomer before proteolysis are likely to be similar to that found in the mature virus. The three-dimensional structures of rhinovirus and Mengo virus suggest that the cleavage sites within the protomeric precursor are in structurally flexible regions. The final proteolytic processing event, maturation of the virion peptide VP0 (also called peptide 1AB) appears to occur by an unusual autocatalytic serine protease-type mechanism possibly involving viral RNA basic groups that would serve as proton-abstractors during the cleavage reaction.\r"

Because PGD2 is a potent bronchoconstrictor and is released into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after allergen stimulation in patients with allergic asthma, the ability of human lung to metabolize PGD2 to 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 and the contractile effects of 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 on human bronchial smooth muscle were investigated. The 100,000 X g supernatant of human lung converted PGD2 in the presence of an NADPH-generating system stereospecifically to 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 at a rate of 3.46 +/- 0.94 pmol per min per mg of protein. 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 was found to contract human bronchial rings in a dose-dependent fashion with a potency virtually identical with that of both PGD2 and PGF2 alpha, known potent bronchial constrictors. PGD2 was found to be a very poor substrate for human lung 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenases and to be preferentially metabolized by lung to 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2. 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 was also found to be a very poor substrate for the lung 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenases. Thus, once formed, 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 would not be expected to be rapidly inactivated in situ by these metabolic enzymes. These results suggest that 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 may participate along with other putative mediators in the pulmonary allergic response in humans.\r"

After incubation of the radioligand with intact cultured cells, the hormone was covalently attached to receptors by using either a photoaffinity technique or chemical (affinity) cross-linking. In each case, covalent labeling was specific, as evidenced by a reduction of labeling when excess competing nonradioactive ligand was present. After covalent attachment of radioligand, membranes were prepared from the cells and solubilized in the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 or octyl glucoside. The soluble membrane fraction present in the supernatant of a 100,000 X g centrifugation was incubated with IgG prepared from anti-PTH antiserum generated to the amino-terminal region, residues 1-34, of PTH. The IgG-PTH-receptor complex was precipitated with staphylococcal protein A-Sepharose. Analysis of the immunoprecipitate on NaDod-SO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography revealed the presence of a doublet of apparent molecular mass 69-70 kDa. Specifically labeled bands of approximate molecular mass 95 and 28 kDa were also observed. The anti-PTH IgG was affinity purified by passage over a PTH-Sepharose column and used to make an immunoaffinity column. The 70- and 28-kDa bands were also observed after labeled solubilized membrane preparations were allowed to bind to this column and then were eluted by using a [Nle]PTH-(1-34)-NH2-containing buffer or acetic acid. These studies suggest that the use of an anti-PTH antiserum that binds receptor-bound hormone is likely to be a useful step in the further physiochemical characterization and purification of the PTH receptor.\r"

The mdr1 gene is also expressed in several human tumors, including many but not all tumors derived from the adrenal gland and the colon. In addition, increased expression was detected in a few tumors at the time of relapse following initial chemotherapy. Although controlled clinical studies will be required, our results suggest that measurement of mdr1 RNA may prove to be a valuable tool in the design of chemotherapy protocols.\r"

Subsequent studies were carried out to quantitate the effect of 5-HT on the 34-kDa protein and to examine whether the 34-kDa protein was involved in the circadian timing system. The regional specificity of the effect of 5-HT on the 34-kDa protein was investigated. The proximal portion of the eye appeared to synthesize much more of the 34-kDa protein than the distal portion. Also, 5-HT had a much larger effect on the synthesis of the 34-kDa protein in the proximal portion than in the distal portion. The proximal location of synthesis and the 5-HT effect on the synthesis of the 34-kDa protein correlate with the proximal location of cells and processes that are necessary for the expression of the circadian rhythm. The relationship between the effect of 5-HT on the circadian rhythm and the effect of 5-HT on the 34-kDa protein was also examined. As 5-HT causes phase shifts in the rhythm by activating adenylate cyclase to increase cAMP, forskolin and 8-benzylthioadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate mimicked the effect of 5-HT on the 34-kDa protein. We also found that 5-HT significantly increased the synthesis of the 34-kDa protein at phases when 5-HT delays or advances the phase of the rhythm but did not increase the synthesis of the 34-kDa protein at a phase when 5-HT did not phase shift. This phase-dependent effect of 5-HT on the 34-kDa protein qualitatively accounts for the phase dependence of the effect of 5-HT on the circadian rhythm. These results, when considered together with our earlier data, suggest that the synthesis of the 34-kDa protein is directly involved in the phase shift produced by 5-HT. The 34-kDa protein is worthy of future investigation as a candidate for a component of the circadian oscillator.\r"

These include the following: BtChoEase is transiently accumulating in patchy fashion on the ventricular side of the neuroepithelium shortly before AcChoEase appears in cell bodies along the opposing mantle layer. The amount of BtChoEase in retina and brain is greatest in the early phase (E3-E5, or incubation periods of 3-5 days); in retina it decreases about 2 days later than in brain. However, AcChoEase expression increases with time, in inverse order to that of BtChoEase. In both tissues decrease of cell proliferation is closely followed by decrease in BtChoEase. A double-labeling technique of cholinesterase staining together with [3H]thymidine autoradiography reveals proliferation zones that are diffusely stained by BtChoEase but not by AcChoEase. Patches intensely stained for BtChoEase accompany clusters of cells in final stages of mitosis on their way to the differentiation zone, where they begin expressing AcChoEase. By applying different thymidine pulses, we identify an 11-hr lag from the last thymidine-uptake to full AcChoEase expression. (iv) These findings are confirmed by studying lens development, where areas of proliferation and differentiation are well separated. The spatiotemporal pattern of the transition of neuroblasts from a proliferating into a differentiating state correlates with the expression of BtChoEase just before and during mitosis and that of AcChoEase about 11 hr after mitosis. Thus cholinesterases could be involved in the regulation of this transition.\r"

The present study demonstrates that NGF regulates a specific bioelectric property of these neurons--the duration of the Ca2+ component of the somatic action potential--at mature stages when they no longer require NGF for survival. Prolonged culture of fetal mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons with relatively low levels of NGF shortens the duration of the action potential. Furthermore, addition or withdrawal of NGF in mature cultures results, within several days, in shorter or longer action potential durations, respectively. Exposure to anti-NGF antiserum accelerates the onset of the longer-lasting action potentials elicited by simple withdrawal of NGF. This plastic response of sensory neurons to NGF may be important in regulating their physiological properties and/or their response to injury.\r"

Under these conditions both oxytocin and cAMP markedly stimulated the movements of Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, Li+, and NH4+ through a pathway that is insensitive to amiloride. The amiloride-insensitive currents were inhibited by the addition of Ca2+, Sr2+, or Mg2+ to the apical solution. The movement of the monovalent cations was associated with a spontaneous Lorentzian component in the power spectrum of the fluctuation in short-circuit current. The plateau of the Lorentzian component was enhanced by oxytocin and cAMP and was depressed by divalent cations. Methohexital inhibited the stimulation of monovalent cation movements caused by oxytocin. These findings suggest that oxytocin and cAMP activate at least two kinds of ionic channels in the apical membrane of toad urinary bladder: the well-known amiloride-sensitive channel and an amiloride-insensitive channel that allows the movement of several monovalent cations and is blocked by Ca2+ and other divalent cations.\r"

  ".W": "Based on nucleotide sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from the virulent and avirulent A/chicken/Pennsylvania/83 influenza viruses, it was previously postulated that acquisition of virulence was associated with a point mutation that resulted in loss of a glycosylation site. Since there are two potential glycosylation sites in this region of the HA molecule and since all Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser sequences in the HAs of different strains are not necessarily glycosylated, the question remained open as to whether either one of these sites was glycosylated. We now provide direct evidence that a site-specific glycosylation affects cleavage of the influenza virus HA and thus virulence. We have identified the glycosylation sites on the HA1 subunit from the virulent and avirulent strains by direct structural analysis of the isolated proteins. Our results show that the only difference in glycosylation between the HA1s of the virulent and avirulent strains is the lack of an asparagine-linked carbohydrate on the virulent HA1 polypeptide at residue 11. Further, we show that the HA1s of both the avirulent and virulent viruses are not glycosylated at one potential site, while all other sites contain carbohydrate. Amino acid sequence analysis of the HA1 of an avirulent revertant of the virulent strain confirmed these findings.\r"

While the protein is 87% identical overall with the previously cloned hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor, the most highly conserved regions are the putative transmembrane helices (95% identical) and cytoplasmic loops (93% identical), suggesting that these regions of the molecule harbor important functional domains. Several of the transmembrane helices also share lesser degrees of identity with comparable regions of select members of the opsin family of visual pigments. We have localized the gene for the beta 2-adrenergic receptor to q31-q32 on chromosome 5. This is the same position recently determined for the gene encoding the receptor for platelet-derived growth factor and is adjacent to that for the FMS protooncogene, which encodes the receptor for the macrophage colony-stimulating factor.\r"

In this paper we show that, at heat shock temperature (34 degrees C), processing at the 3' end of the precursor, rapid turnover of spacer transcripts, and termination are all severely impaired. In contrast, transcription initiation and chain elongation are not significantly affected by heat shock. This results in the appearance of large RNA in the range of 10-20 kilobases and longer.\r"

  ".W": "The high susceptibility of human immunoglobulin D to proteolytic degradation affects its biological function, metabolism, and immunoassay. High-pressure liquid chromatography was used to investigate the mechanism and rate of limited proteolytic cleavage of IgD and also to identify, isolate, and quantify the reaction products. Within 1 to 5 min, tryptic digestion of native IgD almost quantitatively yields a labile Fab fragment, a stable Fc fragment, and a highly charged peptide derived from the hinge region. A galactosamine-rich glycopeptide from the hinge region increases inversely as the Fab is largely degraded to a series of peptides within 1 hr. In contrast, the Fc and the high-charge peptide resist proteolysis for more than 24 hr. The initial sites of cleavage of IgD occur in the hinge region at exposed secondary structures predicted to be beta-turns. Concomitant with removal of the galactosamine-rich glycopeptide at its carboxyl terminus, the Fd fragment is rapidly and rather randomly degraded, but the light chain is somewhat more resistant than the Fd section of the delta heavy chain. This study of the rapid rate of proteolysis of IgD explains the rarity with which intact IgD is found in human sera. It also raises questions about immunoassay of IgD, which is usually measured with antisera against Fc. In vivo, proteolytic cleavage initiates the catabolism of circulating IgD and also affects the role and fate of IgD as an antigen receptor on the B-cell membrane.\r"

  ".U": "87092398\r", 
  ".W": "Pulmonary surfactant is a lipid-rich material that promotes alveolar stability by lowering the surface tension at the air-fluid interface in the peripheral air spaces. The turnover of surfactant phospholipids in the alveolar space is fast, and several lines of evidence suggest there is rapid formation and replenishment of the phospholipid surface film during normal respiration. Specific proteins may regulate these dynamic surface properties. The predominant surfactant protein is a well-characterized, lipid-associated glycoprotein, SP 28-36 (28-36 kDa). A second group of very hydrophobic proteins has recently been shown to affect the surface activity of surfactant phospholipids. We have isolated this group of hydrophobic proteins, herein called SP 5-18 (5-18 kDa), from canine surfactant and have shown by NH2-terminal sequence analysis that at least two proteins, SP 5-8 and SP 18, are present in this group. We have derived the full amino acid sequence of SP 18 from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNAs identified with oligonucleotide probes that were based on the NH2-terminal amino acids of SP 18. The protein isolated from extracellular surfactant appears to be a fragment of a much larger precursor protein (40 kDa). The amino acid sequence of SP 18 is markedly hydrophobic and contains two possible bilayer-spanning domains. We have shown that SP 18 and the glycoprotein SP 28-36 have a cooperative, calcium-dependent action in promoting the formation of phospholipid surface films.\r"

On the basis of the predicted amino acid sequence the molecular weight of the primary translation product, lacking the signal peptide, was 41,183. Hybridization analyses indicated that the two subunits of ABP are coded for by a single gene and a single mRNA species.

The protein precursor consists of a 41 amino acid \"leader\" peptide followed by 635 amino acids corresponding to mature protein S. Comparison of the mature protein region with homologous vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins shows that it is composed of the following domains: an amino-terminal gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich region of 37 amino acids; a 36 amino acid linker region rich in hydroxy amino acids; four epidermal growth factor-like segments, each approximately 45 amino acids long; and a 387 amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain of unrecognized structure and unknown function.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro translation of cellular poly(A)+ RNA coupled with immunoprecipitation was developed as a technique for characterizing 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] receptors and assessing receptor mRNA activity. Cell-free translation of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from chicken intestine revealed two immunoprecipitable forms of avian receptor at 60 kDa and 58 kDa. These two species were identical in electrophoretic mobility to those detected directly in intestinal cytosol by immunoblot analysis. Liver, a tissue devoid of 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding activity, contained no apparent translatable receptor mRNA. 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors were also synthesized in vitro employing poly(A)+ RNA obtained from several cultured mammalian cell lines. Selective immunoprecipitation revealed a single form of receptor at 54 kDa in mouse fibroblasts (3T6) and pig kidney cells (LLC-PK1) and a 52-kDa species in human breast carcinoma (T47D). Each of these in vitro translated mammalian 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors migrated identically with its cellular counterpart that was synthesized in vivo employing metabolic labeling of cell protein with [35S]methionine. In vitro translation of poly(A)+ RNA derived from mouse 3T6 cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 24-48 hr disclosed a 5-fold increase in receptor mRNA activity over untreated control cells. These results are consistent with the conclusions that 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors are protein species ranging from 52 to 60 kDa and that, though their functional and immunological domains have been evolutionarily conserved, an inverse relationship apparently exists between phylogenetic status and receptor mass. The data also support the hypothesis that the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 leads to a significant increase in receptor mRNA activity in 3T6 cells, indicative of receptor autoregulation.\r"

One particular change, the resumption of translation of mRNAs coding for normal cellular proteins, was found to correlate with a polysomal ribosome association not found prior to heat shock. A low molecular weight RNA (ca. 270 nucleotides), whose rapid accumulation was induced by heat shock, became quantitatively associated with polysomal ribosomes during that time when normal cell protein synthesis became reestablished. We estimated that there were one or two of these RNAs per ribosome uniformly distributed throughout the polysomal ribosome population. The gene (or genes) coding for this RNA were found to be transcribed by polymerase III.\r"

The 20-kDa polypeptide is also specifically phosphorylated by activated protein kinase C in a solubilized 20-kDa/80-kDa complex that was obtained after sonication of the insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. Phosphorylation of this polypeptide, in either the insoluble cytoskeletal fraction or the soluble 20-kDa/80-kDa complex, greatly enhances its susceptibility to digestion by the Ca2+-requiring proteinase (calpain, EC 3.4.22.17) of human neutrophils. Thus, signals that activate calpain by mobilizing intracellular calcium would lead to proteolytic activation of protein kinase C, phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, and remodeling of the cytoskeleton by proteolysis of at least one cytoskeletal component.\r"

Reactions with hydroxylamine and NaCNBH3 and reconstitution of the bleached pigment with retinal show that it is very similar to the other retinylidene pigments bacteriorhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and especially the earlier-discovered phototaxis receptor, sensory rhodopsin, renamed sR-I587. The second sensory receptor, sR-II480, has an absorbance maximum at 480 nm and undergoes a cyclic photoreaction with a half-time of approximately 200 msec. Its predominant photocycle intermediate absorbs maximally near 360 nm. The receptor can be detected spectroscopically in the presence of sR-I587 and quantitated through its transient response to 450-nm excitation. It is selectively bleached by low hydroxylamine concentrations that are insufficient to bleach sR-I587 significantly. Its photochemical and phototactic activities can be restored by addition of retinal. The mobility of the receptor, on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels, was similar or identical to that of sR-I587 and slightly faster than bacteriorhodopsin, yielding an apparent molecular mass of 23-24 kDa.\r"

Oscillations in the concentration of ATP can lead to either increases or decreases in efficiency compared to that at constant ATP concentration, with corresponding decreases and increases in dissipation in the irreversible processes of the proton pump, depending on the frequency of the oscillations. Variations of imposed frequencies induce, in the periodic response, variations of phase shifts between the components of the total membrane current, which consist of the pump's proton current and the currents of potassium and calcium ions. Increases in efficiency are attained when the phase shifts are such that maxima (or minima) in the proton pump current and membrane potential occur simultaneously.\r"

Here we report that randomly pulsed electric fields can also lead to work being done, giving rise to speculation as to whether appropriately designed enzymes can extract and convert free energy from the inherent fluctuations in their environment. The paradox is resolved by showing that equilibrium electrical noise resulting from the environment around an enzyme cannot be completely random but is correlated to the state that the enzyme is in. If the noise has the appropriate reciprocal interaction with the enzyme, its potential to serve as a free-energy source disappears. This is shown by Monte Carlo and other numerical calculations and is proven analytically by use of the diagram method. This method also is used to provide an explicit equation showing that, under a range of conditions, our model enzyme will be induced by uncorrelated (\"autonomous\") noise to undergo net cyclic flux. That work can be transduced from the \"random\" noise is demonstrated by using numerical methods.\r"

One clone resistant to G-418 produces and releases surface antigen and e antigen into medium at a high level and accumulates core particles intracellularly. This clone has a chromosomally integrated set of the original recombinant DNA and produces a 3.5-kilobase transcript corresponding to the pregenome RNA as well as HBV DNAs in an extrachromosomal form. Most of these DNAs were in single-stranded or partially double-stranded form and were packaged in the intracellular core particles. In the medium, particles were detected that contained HBV DNA and were morphologically indistinguishable from Dane particles. These results demonstrate that the HBV genome in an integrated state acted as a template for viral gene expression and replication. The cells were maintained for more than 6 months without losing the ability to produce the extrachromosomal HBV DNA and Dane-like particles. Thus, the cells can be used as a model system for analyses of gene expression and DNA replication of HBV in human hepatocytes.\r"

PMN cytoplasts in current use are defective either in activatable respiratory burst oxidase activity or in motile function. By centrifugation of PMN on discontinuous gradients of Ficoll without cytochalasin B, we have created granule-poor cytoplasts in which both these capacities are preserved. Specifically, they generate superoxide anion (O2-.) and reduce nitroblue tetrazolium dye on appropriate stimulation; they respond chemotactically to erythrocytes destroyed by laser microirradiation or to the specific chemoattractants fMet-Leu-Phe (10 nM) and C5a (zymosan-activated serum); and they ingest and kill staphylococci. We can improve the yield of these fragments progressively by preheating (45 degrees C) the cells in suspension for increasing periods of time, but those treatments are attended by a decreasing percentage of cytoplasts with activatable oxidase activity, and a progressive inability of the cytoplasts to ingest and to kill staphylococci. These easily made and multipotent cytoplasts readily lend themselves to studies of PMN physiology.\r"

  ".W": "Discrete changes in silkmoth choriogenesis have occurred during evolution, as exemplified in the present report in Antheraea polyphemus and Hyalophora cecropia. At the level of morphology, the chorion of A. polyphemus has surface structures, called aeropyle crowns, that are absent from H. cecropia. Aeropyle crowns form during the very late period of choriogenesis and consist of two substructures--lamellae and filler. Filler is present in H. cecropia in greatly reduced amounts. At the level of protein synthesis, overall similarities in the two species are maintained until the very late period of choriogenesis, when synthesis of aeropyle crown components is maximal. In H. cecropia, very late period-specific proteins are reduced in number and abundance. Several of these minor proteins are candidates for E1 and E2, the components of filler. E1 and E2 RNAs are about 35 times more abundant in A. polyphemus, despite very similar gene copy numbers and times of expression in the two species. These results support the hypothesis that evolutionary changes in chorion morphology have resulted from regulatory changes in the expression of chorion genes, either at the level of transcription or mRNA decay. The hypothesis that evolutionary changes in chorion morphology are based on terminal addition onto a preexisting developmental program is discussed.\r"

Southern blot analysis of DNA from a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, using portions of the cDNA as probe, indicates that the gene for human DNA polymerase beta is single copy and located on the short arm or proximal long arm of chromosome 8 (8pter-8q22). A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was detected in normal individuals by using a probe from the 5' end of the cDNA, and this RFLP probably is due to an insertion or duplication of DNA in 20-25% of the population. This restriction site can be used as one marker for chromosome 8 genetic linkage studies and for family studies of traits potentially involving this DNA repair gene.\r"

Like that of their south African counterparts, the quality of semen specimens from east African cheetahs was poor, with a low concentration of spermatozoa (25.3 X 10(6) per ejaculate) and a high incidence of morphological abnormalities (79%). From an electrophoretic survey of the products of 49 genetic loci in A. jubatus raineyi, two allozyme polymorphisms were detected; one of these, for a nonspecific esterase, shows an allele that is rare (less than 1% incidence) in south African specimens. Estimates of polymorphism (2-4%) and average heterozygosity (0.0004-0.014) affirm the cheetah as the least genetically variable felid species. The genetic distance between south and east African cheetahs was low (0.004), suggesting that the development of genetic uniformity preceded the recent geographic isolation of the subspecies. We propose that at least two population bottlenecks followed by inbreeding produced the modern cheetah species. The first and most extreme was ancient, possibly late Pleistocene (circa 10,000 years ago); the second was more recent (within the last century) and led to the south African populations.\r"

Antigen-exposed APC that are treated with phospholipase and then immediately fixed lose their ability to stimulate antigen-plus-Ia-specific T-T hybridomas. This effect is seen with highly purified phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C. In addition it is observed with three distinct antigens--ovalbumin, bovine insulin, and poly(LGlu56LLys35LPhe9) [(GluLysPhe)n]. The effect of phospholipases is highly specific. Identically treated APC are equivalent to controls in their ability to stimulate alloreactive hybridomas specific for precisely the same Ia molecule that is corecognized by antigen-plus-Ia-specific hybrids. Furthermore, the antigen-presenting function of enzyme-treated, fixed APC can be reconstituted by the addition of exogenous in vitro processed or \"processing independent\" antigens. In parallel studies 125I-labeled avidin was shown to specifically bind to APC that were previously exposed and allowed to process biotin-insulin. Biotin-insulin-exposed APC that are pretreated with phospholipase bind significantly less 125I-labeled avidin than do untreated, exposed APC. Identical enzyme treatment does not reduce the binding of avidin to a biotinylated antibody already bound to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules of APC. At least some of the biotin-insulin surface sites are immunologically relevant, because the presentation of processed biotin-insulin by fixed APC is blocked by avidin. This effect is specific. Avidin binding to biotin-insulin-exposed APC does not inhibit allospecific stimulation nor the presentation of unconjugated insulin. These studies demonstrate that phospholipase effectively removes processed cell surface antigen.\r"

Sonicates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from patients with polycythemia vera, idiopathic myelofibrosis, and essential thrombocytosis contained soluble factors that stimulated the proliferation of quiescent-confluent 3T3 cells. PBMNC sonicates from normal individuals; from patients with secondary erythrocytosis, chronic myelogenous leukemia, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute myelogenous leukemia; and from K-562 and HL-60 cells did not stimulate proliferation. Polycythemia vera PBMNC sonicates also induced anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar by normal rat kidney fibroblasts. Both the mitogenic and transforming activities of the polycythemia vera PBMNC sonicates resided in the T-lymphocyte-depleted mononuclear fraction of the PBMNC and were not secreted. By gel filtration, reversed-phase HPLC and NaDodSO4/PAGE, the mitogenic and transforming activities in the polycythemia vera PBMNC were localized to three proteins with molecular masses of 13-, 17-, and 65-kDa. The 13-kDa protein was only mitogenic, and the 17-kDa protein was only transforming, whereas the 65-kDa protein had both mitogenic and transforming activity. These proteins may be involved in the autonomous hematopoiesis that characterizes polycythemia vera, idiopathic myelofibrosis, and essential thrombocytosis.\r"

LDL oxidatively modified either by incubation with endothelial cells in Ham's F-10 medium or by incubation with 5 microM copper(II) ion in the absence of cells is recognized by this same receptor. This oxidative modification, whether cell-induced or copper-catalyzed, is accompanied by many changes in the physical and chemical properties of LDL, including an increase in density, conversion of phosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidylcholine, generation of lipid peroxides, and degradation of apolipoprotein B-100. Which changes are essential for eliciting the recognition by the receptor is not known. In the present paper it is shown that fragments of the degraded apolipoprotein from delipidated, oxidized LDL can be almost quantitatively resolubilized using n-octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside. These 125I-labeled, solubilized apoproteins were degraded rapidly by mouse peritoneal macrophages, and that degradation was competitively inhibited by unlabeled acetyl-LDL and endothelial cell-modified LDL but not by native LDL. These results show that the acetyl-LDL receptor recognizes an epitope on the apoprotein moiety, either newly generated or exposed as a result of oxidative modification, rather than some oxidized lipid moiety. Further, the results suggest that the lipids of oxidatively modified LDL do not play an obligatory role in determining the conformation of that epitope.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work has shown that the kinetoplast minicircle DNA of Leishmania species exhibits species-specific sequence divergence and this observation has led to the development of a DNA probe-based diagnostic test for leishmaniasis. In the work reported here, we demonstrate that the minicircle is composed of three types of DNA sequences with differing specificities reflecting different rates of DNA sequence change. A library of cloned fragments of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) from Leishmania mexicana amazonensis was prepared and the cloned subfragments were found to contain DNA sequences with different taxonomic specificities based on hybridization analysis with various species of Leishmania. Four groups of subfragments were found, those that hybridized with a large number of Leishmania sp. as well as sequences unique to the species, subspecies, or isolate. Analysis of nested deletions of a single, full-length minicircle demonstrates that these different taxonomic specificities are contained within a single minicircle. This implies that different regions of a single minicircle have DNA sequences that diverge at different rates. These sequences represent potentially valuable tools in diagnostic, epidemiologic, and ecological studies of leishmaniasis and provide the basis for a model of kDNA sequence evolution.\r"

  ".U": "87092450\r", 
  ".W": "Five distinct Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-determined nuclear antigens (EBNA-1 to EBNA-5) were recently identified. Antibody responses to these antigens could conceivably differ, and thus prove of serodiagnostic value, in EBV-associated disease processes. As a first step, murine or human cell lines transfected with appropriate EBV DNA fragments and stably expressing either EBNA-1 or EBNA-2 were used to determine the frequency and time of emergence of antibodies to these two antigens in the course of acute and chronic infectious mononucleosis (IM) and to assess their titers in so-called chronic active EBV infections. Following IM, antibodies to EBNA-2 arose first and, after reaching peak titers, declined again in time to lower persistent or even nondetectable levels. Antibodies to EBNA-1 emerged several weeks or months after anti-EBNA-2 and gradually attained the titers at which they persisted indefinitely. The ratios between the anti-EBNA-1 and anti-EBNA-2 titers therefore were generally well below 1.0 during the first 6-12 months after IM and turned to well above 1.0 during the second year. In clear cases of chronic IM, the inversion of this ratio was delayed or prevented. In the less well-defined chronic EBV infections, low ratios were observed in only some of the patients. Because many of these illnesses were not ushered in by a proven IM and often showed EBV-specific antibody profiles within the normally expected range, a causal role of the virus in these cases remains doubtful.\r"

When incorporated into the membrane of liposomes, the purified protein mediates the cyclic GMP-dependent efflux of entrapped Ca2+. The reconstituted channel protein exhibits properties similar to the cyclic GMP-dependent channel observed in excised patches of the plasma membrane and in disk membranes. Cyclic GMP activated the channel cooperatively (Hill coefficient n = 3.1) with an apparent Michaelis constant of approximately 11 microM. After reconstitution of the purified protein into a planar lipid bilayer, we recorded cyclic GMP-stimulated single-channel activity. The single-channel conductance at physiological salt concentrations and in the absence of divalent cations was 26 pS. The drug l-cis-diltiazem, shown to block the cyclic GMP-dependent channel in excised patches of the plasma membrane and in isolated disks of rod outer segments, was ineffective against the purified channel.\r"

  ".W": "Small pieces of Torpedo electric organ were cryofixed at 1-ms time intervals in a liquid medium at -190 degrees C before, during, and after the passage of a single nerve impulse. In contrast to studies using this or other preparations, these experiments were done without 4-aminopyridine or other drugs that potentiate transmitter release. Freeze-fracture replicas were made from the most superficial layers of the tissue, where the rate of cooling was rapid enough to retain ultrastructure in the absence of chemical fixation. We found that the transmission of an impulse was accompanied by the momentary appearance of a population of large intramembrane particles in both the protoplasmic (P) and the external (E) leaflets of the presynaptic plasma membrane. The change was very brief, appearing soon after the stimulus artifact. It lasted for 2-3 ms. Large pits denoting vesicle openings at the presynaptic membrane were found in a small proportion of nerve terminals; their number did not increase during transmission of the nerve impulse. Reducing the temperature from 16 to 5 degrees C slowed the time course of both the electrophysiological response and the change in intramembrane particles. The number of large particles did not increase when stimulation was applied in a low-Ca medium, a condition where the nerve terminals were still depolarized by the action potential but did not release the neurotransmitter. From these and other observations, we conclude that this transient change of intramembrane particles is closely linked to the mechanism of acetylcholine release at the nerve-electroplaque junction.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported the immunoaffinity purification of an acetylcholine receptor from chicken brain that did not bind alpha-bungarotoxin but did bind nicotine and other cholinergic agonists. Antisera and monoclonal antibodies raised against this receptor crossreacted with a receptor from rat brain that had similar pharmacological properties, and also bound to functional acetylcholine receptors in chicken ciliary ganglion cells and rat PC12 cells. Here we report purification of the receptor from rat brain using monoclonal antibody (mAb) 270 raised against receptor from chicken brain. This receptor, similar in size to monomers of receptor from Torpedo electric organ, contained two subunits--apparent Mr, 51,000 and 79,000. The Mr 51,000 subunit was bound by antisera to alpha subunits of receptor from Torpedo electric organ and by mAb 270, which is specific for the Mr 49,000 subunit analogue of receptor from chicken brain. Both subunits were bound by mAb 286, which also binds both subunits of receptors from chicken brain. The alpha-bungarotoxin binding component was purified from the same extracts. It consisted of four subunits of apparent Mr 44,700, 52,300, 56,600, and 65,200. The basic structure of receptors from muscle had evolved to an (alpha)2 beta gamma delta subunit stoichiometry by the time of primitive elasmobranches and is now little changed in mammals. The apparent (alpha)2(beta)2 or (alpha)3(beta)2 structure of the neuronal acetylcholine receptors that we have purified may derive from an early gene duplication event in the evolution of the extended gene family, which now also includes receptors from ganglia and muscle as well as neuronal alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites.\r"

  ".W": "Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) may play a role in the cellular interactions leading to myelination. Using monoclonal antibodies and conventional antisera against MAG, we have isolated a cDNA clone from an expression library prepared from rat brain mRNA. The identity of the clone was confirmed by the exact match between its nucleotide sequence and two peptide sequences of 13 and 9 amino acids that we obtained by Edman degradation of two CNBr fragments of MAG. The cDNA clone hybridized to two size species of mRNA in rat approximately 3.5 kilobases in length. These mRNAs were present in brain but not liver and were expressed most abundantly at the time of active myelination (day 14). The mRNA for MAG was present at barely detectable levels in hypomyelinating jimpy mice compared to normal littermate controls. Therefore the MAG cDNA clone is both brain and myelin specific. DNA sequence analysis revealed that our MAG cDNA was derived from the same mRNA as clone p1B236, a randomly selected, brain-specific, partial cDNA isolated by Sutcliffe et al. [Sutcliffe, J. G., Milner, R. J., Shinnick, T. M. & Bloom, F. E. (1983) Cell 33, 671-682]. Analysis of the predicted protein sequence suggests that MAG has a long extracellular domain (499 amino acids), followed by a short transmembrane segment (20 amino acids) and an intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain (90 amino acids). The molecule has several glycosylation sites, three internal repeats homologous to a repeat in the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), and sites for phosphorylation near the carboxyl terminus. The primary structure reported here provides a molecular framework for further investigations into the function of the MAG molecule.\r"

Using this new dual stain, they demonstrated that ten out of ten chronic granulocytic leukemia patients they examined had cells that contained both eosinophilic and basophilic granules. The identity of the granules was corroborated by electron microscopic studies. These observations suggest that lineage confusion is common in chronic granulocytic leukemia.\r"

The analysis confirms the previous observations that both MET and D7S8 are closely linked to CF. Based on the result from one family, MET appears to be more proximal to the centromere than CF. Our analysis also suggests that genetic heterogeneity may account for the high recombination fraction between CF and D7S8 observed in another family. In addition, a strong linkage disequilibrium has been observed between CF and the two closely flanking markers.\r"

Higher doses of the agent (500 to 800 micrograms per day) had no effect on metastases in one of two patients with metastatic gastrinoma. In the other patient, one tumor shrank but the other continued to grow after three months of treatment while serum gastrin levels did not change. Cultured metastatic tumor tissue from this patient released different forms of gastrin; growth rates varied, independent of uptake of SMS 201-995, and gastrin release increased. A neonate with nesidioblastosis maintained normal blood glucose levels while receiving SMS 201-995 therapy following a 95 percent pancreatic resection. In two elderly patients with organic hypoglycemia--one with a single benign adenoma and one with multiple adenomatosis--the somatostatin analogue did not prolong the hypoglycemia-free interval. In nine patients with carcinoid syndrome, flushing was uniformly controlled with 50 micrograms of SMS 201-995 administered every eight to 12 hours. One of the nine required exocrine pancreatic replacement. After six months of treatment, three of the nine had no change in tumor size and one had remission of symptoms and stopped treatment. In two patients with vipoma, SMS 201-995 controlled diarrhea and reduced levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide; tumor necrosis occurred in one patient. In a patient with diabetic diarrhea unresponsive to all treatments, SMS 201-995 therapy controlled the diarrhea but did not interfere with control of the diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier experiments characterized the effect of SMS 201-995 on gastrin secretion from gastrinoma in vivo. The results showed that the somatostatin analogue inhibits basal as well as secretin- and calcium-stimulated gastrin secretion. The current study examined the effect of SMS 201-995 on gastrin secretion from gastrinoma in vitro. Gastrinoma cells were prepared in cell culture or acute cell dispersion to study basal gastrin release. In cell culture, SMS 201-995 at 10(-9) M, 10(-8) M, and 10(-7) M significantly stimulated gastrin secretion (basal medium gastrin, 157 +/- 7.9 pg/ml; with SMS 201-995 10(-9) M, 786 +/- 62 pg/ml; with SMS 201-995 10(-8) M, 569 +/- 72 pg/ml; and with SMS 201-995 10(-7) M, 258 +/- 26 pg/ml). In contrast, in acute cell dispersion, the somatostatin analogue inhibited gastrin secretion (basal medium gastrin, 12.8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml; with SMS 201-995 10(-9) M, 9.0 +/- 0.1 ng/ml; with SMS 201-995 10(-8) M, 8.4 +/- 1.5 ng/ml; and with SMS 201-995 10(-7) M, 7.9 +/- 0.2 ng/ml). Gastrinoma cells were prepared in cell culture to study the effect of SMS 201-995 on gastrin secretion stimulated by secretin and by post-receptor increases in adenosine cyclic nucleotide. The somatostatin analogue inhibited gastrin secretion stimulated by secretin (10(-6) M) (797 +/- 48 pg/ml for secretin alone, compared with 396 +/- 9.4 pg/ml for secretin plus SMS 201-995). SMS 201-995 did not inhibit gastrin secretion stimulated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-7) M) (617 +/- 62 pg/ml for dibutyryl cyclic AMP alone, compared with 778 +/- 55 pg/ml for the two together). In vitro, SMS 201-995 inhibits basal gastrin secretion from gastrinoma prepared in acute cell dispersion, but not gastrinoma in cell culture, probably due to differences in basal secretory rates. The effect in vitro is less than that in vivo. SMS 201-995 does not inhibit postreceptor increases in adenosine nucleotide. This indirectly supports the hypothesis that SMS 201-995 acts in gastrinoma cells to inhibit gastrin secretion by inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

  ".W": "The beneficial effect of the long-acting analogue of somatostatin SMS 201-995 in the treatment of acromegaly is described in three cases, and current published experience is reviewed. A total of 64 patients from 10 series have received the drug from one to 25 months, usually in doses of 50-150 micrograms every eight hours by subcutaneous injection. Clinical and chemical improvement was observed in the majority of subjects but normal 24-hour serum growth hormone levels were achieved in no more than 35 percent of this group and possibly less. We have found that higher doses, up to 1,500 micrograms per day, which have generally been free of side effects, are sometimes required to normalize growth hormone secretion. A reduction of up to 33 percent in pituitary tumor size has been reported in more than half of the 27 cases studied from four groups. Clinically important side effects are infrequent, but diarrhea, usually transient, occurred in about 13 percent, with frank steatorrhea in 2 to 6 percent of cases. Alteration in carbohydrate metabolism, such as transient glucose intolerance at the start of therapy in non-diabetic acromegalic patients, and increased sensitivity to insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetic acromegalic patients, is common. Overall, SMS 201-995 appears to be a valuable new agent for the treatment of acromegaly, but long-term safety needs to be established.\r"

A net decrease (p less than 0.001) in prostaglandin E2 release by chorion-decidua was identified after labor (fetal = 0.12 +/- 0.05 ng; maternal = 0.17 +/- 0.09 ng) when compared with that before labor (fetal = 1.28 +/- 0.69 ng; maternal = 2.31 +/- 0.56 ng). Amnion-chorion-decidua released more prostaglandin E2 on the fetal side after labor (2.37 +/- 1.43 ng) than prior to labor (1.49 +/- 0.60 ng); however, prostaglandin E2 on the maternal side was significantly less (p less than 0.05) after labor (0.24 +/- 0.12 ng) when compared with that of the prelabor membrane (2.03 +/- 1.08 ng). Elution of prostaglandin E2 from preincubated membranes and endogenous membrane prostaglandin E2 content showed similar results. Thus concentrations of prostaglandin E2 on the maternal side of the fetal membranes appear diminished after spontaneous labor despite an increased release from the fetal surface.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the risk of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in San Francisco, the prevalence of antibodies to HIV was determined in 281 heterosexual intravenous drug users recruited from community-based settings. Ten per cent of subjects had ELISA and Western blot confirmed seropositivity for antibodies (95 per cent CI 6.8-14.2 per cent). Analysis of behavioral factors revealed an increased risk of seropositivity in addicts who reported regularly sharing needles when injecting, particularly those sharing with two or more persons (odds ratio = 5.43; 95 per cent CI 1.08-52.5). Blacks and Latinos also had a greater prevalence of seropositivity than Whites, and this finding persisted after adjustment for needle sharing (adjusted odds ratio = 2.8; 95 per cent CI .84-8.59). Seropositivity was not associated with age, sex, duration of drug use, or history of prostitution. These data indicate that a new epidemic of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) in intravenous drug users, similar to that which has occurred among homosexuals in San Francisco, is possible. The relatively low seroprevalence in 1985 provides health officials an important opportunity to intervene and attempt to prevent widespread infection of drug users with HIV.\r"

  ".W": "Alveolar macrophages (AM) may function as effector cells that can either stimulate or inhibit lung fibroblast collagen production. However, conditions that determine the predominant effect of AM on fibroblasts are not well understood. To delineate factors that modulate the effects of AM on lung fibroblasts, we studied the interaction of AM products and fibroblasts in vitro. The AM were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage of hamsters with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Conditioned medium (CM) from the AM cultures was incubated in varying amounts with lung fibroblast (IMR-90) cultures. After metabolic labeling with [3H]proline, fibroblast collagen production based on procollagen-specific radioactivity was determined (Anal Biochem 1984; 140:478). Macrophage CM in concentrations greater than 5% suppressed collagen production, an event attributed to the macrophage-derived suppressive factor that we have previously characterized (J Clin Invest 1983; 72:2082). Macrophages were also determined to produce PGE2 in culture (500 pg/10(6) cells). Authentic PGE2 at concentrations found in CM was found to suppress fibroblast collagen production, indicating that AM-derived PGE2 contributes to the suppressive activity in CM. To examine possible stimulatory factors in CM, the fibroblasts were preincubated with indomethacin. This approach was based on our previous observation that AM-derived suppressive factor increases endogenous fibroblast PGE2 and that its activity can be blocked by indomethacin. Macrophage CM in a concentration of 20% did not suppress the collagen production of indomethacin-treated fibroblasts. However, CM concentrations of 5 and 10% increased collagen production (173 and 143% of control values, respectively), indicating the presence of stimulatory factor(s) in macrophage-conditioned medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A family with C2d in which three members have developed SCLE was observed and studied clinically, serologically, and immunogenetically. Deficiency of the second component of complement was present in all six family members, while anti-Ro was present in only two. There was a strong but incomplete association of C2d and SCLE with HLA-DR2, but the association was not complete with positivity of anti-Ro or antinuclear antibodies. Study of this family reconfirmed the close association of HLA-A25, -B18 and -DR2 with the C2 gene, but indicated a less close association of these loci with serologic markers.\r"

A careful cutaneous examination, with particular attention to recent scars, may provide the only evidence of relapse in adult leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "The chronic leukemias are associated with significant morbidity from splenic enlargement and hyperfunction. Although some patients with chronic leukemia benefit from splenectomy, the indications for operation are unclear. To identify those patients who benefit most from splenectomy, nine patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and eight patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) who had splenectomy to palliate the symptoms of massive splenic bulk or to improve the hematologic sequelae of splenic hyperfunction were studied. Splenectomy for bulk symptoms provided good palliation of symptoms, but the duration of the benefit was limited by the stage of the disease. Five of eight patients with CGL with bulk symptoms died within 6 months of operation. Splenectomy for hyperfunction was limited to a short-term hematologic response. In three of four patients with CLL who were Coombs positive, the presence of autoantibodies correlated with a recurrent transfusion requirement within 3 months of splenectomy. Thus, the benefit of splenectomy for bulk symptoms must be weighed against the risk of surgery and the patient's limited life expectancy. The benefit of splenectomy for treatment of splenic hyperfunction depends on the stimulus to hyperfunction and may not be beneficial for patients with refractory autoimmune anemias.\r"

The endothelial cells, many lymphocytes, and various monocytic-macrophagic cells in the endometrial stroma were Ia positive. Furthermore, Ia antigens were localized to normal endometrial epithelium in the proliferative phase, and focally in epithelium adjacent to stromal lymphoid aggregates throughout the cycle. Expression of Ia antigens in the secretory epithelium was focal or absent. At the ultrastructural level, Ia-positive epithelial cells exhibited staining on the plasma membrane, in free and membrane-bound ribosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and occasional perinuclear cisternae. In the endothelial cells and lymphocytes, Ia antigens were also localized to the plasma membrane and rough endoplasmic reticulum. These findings indicate that endometrial epithelium expresses Ia antigens which may be regulated by endometrial lymphoid cells and/or hormones. The plasma membrane expression of Ia antigens by the epithelial cells of endometrium appears to result from active synthesis, and not merely from passive absorption of Ia antigens.\r"

This monoclonal antibody was not directed to viral antigens because it reacted equally well with almost all KUT-2 and MT-1 cells, only 1% to 3% of which were ATL-associated antigen-positive. In contrast to interleukin 2 receptors expressed on both ATL cells and normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated blasts, this antigen was not expressed on the latter cells. The antigen, mainly expressed on the cell membrane, was analyzed by metabolic labeling with 3H-leucine and surface labeling with 125I followed by cell lysis and immunoprecipitation with the FTF 148 antibody. The findings obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that p50 and p74 proteins were specifically precipitated and the antigen was also different from the product of the Xs gene of HTLV-I.\r"

We selected 101 sera; 16 were obtained from normal donors with no known risk factors, and 85 were from patients with full-fledged AIDS (28 cases), AIDS-related complex (ARC, 22 cases), and healthy people at risk (homosexuals, intravenous [IV] drug users, relatives of AIDS patients; 35 cases). Seropositivity for antibodies against the envelope (gp41) and gag antigens (p15, p24) was determined by Western blot using disrupted HTLV-III virions. Of the 101 sera, all 16 from nonrisk donors and 3/35 from healthy at-risk donors were negative for antibodies against either the gp41 or p15 and p24. The remaining 82 sera were seropositive for either the gp41 and/or the p15 and p24. All sera were then tested against the three known HTLV-III antigens (3'orf, sor, and tat-III) that have been synthesized in bacteria. Our data indicate that all the HTLV-III antigens tested are immunogenic in vivo. No significant difference in antibody prevalence to gp41 (close to 100%) and to the 3'orf, sor, and tat-III proteins (approximately 50%) was observed with regard to stage of the disease. In contrast, the prevalence of antibodies against the core antigens decreased from approximately 100% in infected people with no clinical signs of disease to 50% in ARC and AIDS patients. The percentage of patients seropositive for all five antigens tested was increased in the AIDS group. These results indicate that the greatest antibody prevalence was obtained using viral envelope antigen and further suggest that screening with the newly identified 3'orf, sor, and tat-III proteins as antigens would confer no further diagnostic advantage. The pattern of natural antibodies observed during disease progression did not suggest any pathogenetic mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study, we showed that the blast stem cells of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) were more sensitive to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) when growing in suspension culture than during colony formation in methylcellulose. We suggested that the difference might be explained by considering the cellular mechanisms responsible for growth in suspension and colony formation. In the former, the clonogenic cells increase in number (self-renewal); in the latter, most of the divisions are terminal. The increased sensitivity to ara-C in suspension might then be attributed to its ability to inhibit self-renewal to a greater degree than cell division generally. A test of this hypothesis would be to compare the survival curves in suspension and in methylcellulose using a drug that spared or stimulated self-renewal. Such an agent is 5-azacytidine (5-aza) and has the additional advantage that its analogue, 6-azacytidine (6-aza) has no effect on self renewal. The data supported the hypothesis, since clonogenic AML blasts were much less sensitive to 5-aza in suspension than in methylcellulose. The effect of 6-aza, while qualitatively similar, was much less marked. Controls showed that the difference in survival curves could not be explained on a kinetic basis or by the secretion of growth factors by 5-aza-treated cells. We suggest that a comparison of the effects of drugs in suspension and in methylcellulose may be useful in preclinical screening of putative anti-AML compounds.\r"

The adhesion could be quantitatively inhibited by the synthetic peptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and upon hemin-induced differentiation or trypsinization of the cells. Many of the cells also displayed rapid spreading that led to a redistribution of F-actin into spreading edges and in many cells also to a formation of typical actin fibers attaching to the ventral aspect of the cells. The spreading of the cells was inhibited by cytochalasin B but not by microtubule-disrupting drugs, suggesting an active role for the microfilament system in the spreading process. Direct overlay assay of electrophoretically separated polypeptides with 125I-Fn showed that in K562 cells there is a major Mr 190,000 Fn-binding protein that is lost upon differentiation. A similar overlay assay with purified plasma and cellular Fns followed by immunostaining with anti-Fn antibodies revealed a reaction with a similar polypeptide. The binding of Fns on the nitrocellulose sheets could be inhibited and the bound Fn eluted by using the RGDS peptide. From octylglucoside extracts of radioactively surface-labeled cells, distinct Mr 190,000/185,000 membrane glycoproteins bound to Fn-heptapeptide-Sepharose, further suggesting that the Mr 190,000 polypeptide would be the Fn-receptor of the K562 cells.\r"

  ".W": "To study the feasibility of using retroviruses for gene transfer into human hemopoietic cells, various cell types were exposed to virus carrying the gene for neomycin resistance (neor). In preliminary studies using K562 cells as targets, we found that high viral titer and co-cultivation with viral producer cells rather than incubation in medium exposed to viral producer cells were important variables for achieving high frequencies of G418 resistant (G418r) colonies. The maximum frequency of G418r K562 colonies after co-cultivation with cells producing a neor virus titer of 4 X 10(6) cfu/mL was 60%. When primary human progenitors from normal marrow, fetal liver, or chronic myelogenous leukemia blood were exposed to high titer viral stocks, both with and without helper virus, under conditions optimized for K562 cells, maximum frequencies of G418r colonies were 3% to 16% for granulocyte macrophage progenitors and 2% to 6% for primitive erythroid progenitors. The presence of the neor gene in both G418r K562 and primary hemopoietic colonies was verified by Southern blot. Expression of the neor gene was shown by RNA spot blot. These data demonstrate efficient transfer and expression of the neor gene in both K562 cells and primary human hemopoietic cells from normal and leukemic individuals.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies of purine ribonucleotide metabolism in the human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60, we observed that there is a down-regulation of guanine ribonucleotide biosynthesis from the central intermediate, inosine monophosphate (IMP) and a depletion of intracellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) pools that occur during the induced maturation of these cells. We also found that inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of guanylate synthesis from IMP, are potent inducers of HL-60 maturation. Because of these observations we specifically investigated the activity of IMP dehydrogenase in HL-60 cells and in a new inducible human myeloid leukemia cell line, RDFD2-25, both during maintenance culture and during induced maturation of the cells. Enzyme activity was examined directly in cell extracts with a radiometric assay that measures free 3H2O formed from [2-3H] IMP during the conversion of IMP to XMP. Uninduced HL-60 and RDFD2 cells in maintenance culture were found to have high levels of IMPD activity (5.2 to 5.7 pmol IMP metabolized/10(7) cells/min) compared with normal neutrophils and monocytes that had been purified from blood (less than 1.5 pmol IMP metabolized/10(7) cells/min). However, when HL-60 and RDFD2-25 cells were induced to mature with retinoic acid (10(-6) mol/L), dimethylformamide (6 X 10(-2) mol/L), or a known IMPD inhibitor, tiazofurin (10(-6) mol/L), IMPD activity in the cells fell by 51% to 80% within three to six hours. These changes in IMPD activity preceded detectable functional and antigenic maturation of the cells by at least 12 hours and were not temporally related to changes in cellular proliferation. These findings are consistent with the concept that the regulation of myeloid cell maturation may be influenced by intracellular concentrations of guanine ribonucleotides because IMP dehydrogenase activity is known to be rate limiting for the production of these nucleotides.\r"

There was a significantly greater incidence of ataxia, areflexia and clinical nerve enlargement in HMSN type III. In HMSN type III, there was also a significantly lower density of myelinated fibres 8 microns or more in diameter, a greater frequency of onion bulbs, more lamellae per onion bulb and, a higher ratio of mean axon diameter to fibre diameter. The functional severity of the HMSN type III cases was not markedly worse than those with HMSN type I. Using these parameters, it was possible to attempt classification of sporadic cases of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid protein levels were unreliable in distinguishing the two types of neuropathy.\r"

In all cases of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma with ascites, CA 125 levels were above 35 U/ml. The specificity and sensitivity of CA 125 measurement for detecting ascites in chronic liver diseases were 73% and 100%, respectively. Furthermore, the CA 125 level was always higher in ascites than in serum. The authors conclude that CA 125 is a nonspecific marker of ascites. This result must be considered in the interpretation of CA 125 elevation in patients with ovarian cancer. Moreover, CA 125 may be of value in the diagnosis and monitoring of peritoneal diseases.\r"

This study was carried out to test a hypothesis that measuring the combined levels of selected tumor associated antigens in effusions could predict the primary source of malignancy. The results indicate that an elevated fluid CA 125 level (greater than 14,000 U/ml-68,000 U/ml) and a negative fluid CEA level (less than 5 ng/ml) is suggestive of serous and endometrioid carcinoma of ovary, and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium and fallopian tube. Alternatively, an elevated fluid CEA level (14 ng/ml-600 ng/ml) and a negative CA 125 level (20-5000 U/ml) is seen in metastatic carcinomas of breast, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Lymphomas, melanomas, and benign effusions are negative for both antigens.

Regions that showed decreases in 99mTc MDP plasma clearance of more than 20% were associated with areas of necrotic tumor, and regions that showed absent decline or increasing clearance rates were associated with high residual cell viability and incomplete response to chemotherapy. Therefore, functional bone scintigraphy allows an objective presurgical assessment of tumor response to chemotherapy.\r"

The relative risk of developing t-ANLL was 9 for a MCV maximum increase over 24 fl during therapy, which was observed in 71% of the patients with t-ANLL and in only 22% of the controls. For the greatest 3-month MCV increase over 15 fl observed in 57% of the t-ANLL patients and in 17% of the controls, the relative risk reached 15. This suggests that there is at least one factor, independent from therapy, which predisposes to t-ANLL. MCV evolution during therapy appears useful in determining which HD patients have a high risk of developing t-ANLL.\r"

In three paraosteal osteosarcomas, no DNA aneuploidy was detected and a significantly lower proportion of cells in S-phase was observed as compared to the highly malignant osteosarcomas (mean 8.6% vs. 18.8%; P less than 0.05). Like in the paraosteal osteosarcomas, no DNA aneuploidy and a low fraction of cells in S-phase was found in the predominant cell population of one of the very rare sclerosing small cell osteosarcomas, which also revealed a second DNA stemline with a DNA index of 2.0. These results demonstrate a high degree of DNA stemline heterogeneity in highly malignant osteosarcomas. The data emphasize the usefulness of DNA measurements for the characterization of bone tumors and indicate the possibility of discriminating highly malignant from low-grade osteosarcomas.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that dopamine may alter kidney function by actions not only in the renal vasculature but also at the glomerular-mesangial level. We studied this phenomenon by examining the ability of dopamine to antagonize the contractile properties of angiotensin II in isolated rat glomeruli and cultured mesangial cells. In isolated rat glomeruli angiotensin II caused a decrease in the planar surface area, indicating glomerular contraction, an effect that was abolished by coincubation with dopamine. Angiotensin II also mediated shape changes in cultured mesangial cells, which resulted in a decline in their planar areas. Simultaneous addition of dopamine prevented these decreases in cell size. In mesangial cells grown on a flexible silicone rubber support, angiotensin II addition enhanced wrinkling of the mobile surface. This indicated that the angiotensin-II-induced decrease in cell size observed in cells grown on conventional substrata represented contraction. Conversely, dopamine caused a rapid reduction in wrinkling of the surfaces from control cells as well as those previously treated with angiotensin II, actions consistent with cell relaxation. The prostaglandin inhibitor indomethacin did not alter the ability of dopamine to attenuate angiotensin-II-associated reductions in mesangial cell surface area. Direct determination of mesangial cell prostaglandin-E2 production showed that dopamine did not change either basal synthesis or angiotensin-II-stimulated synthesis of prostaglandin. The results demonstrate that dopamine antagonizes the constrictor effect of angiotensin II at the glomerular-mesangial level. This action of dopamine is prostaglandin independent. These findings support a role for dopamine in the regulation of glomerular filtration and may provide a rationale for its use during states of renal vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyzes the S-methylation of thiopurine drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and azathioprine. Human erythrocyte (RBC) TPMT activity is controlled by a common genetic polymorphism. On a genetic basis approximately one in every 300 subjects lacks TPMT activity, and 11% of subjects have intermediate activities. 6-Thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) are major metabolites of 6-MP and azathioprine in humans. RBC 6-TGN concentrations are correlated directly with risk for the development of leukopenia in patients treated with thiopurine drugs. Our studies were performed to determine whether there was a relationship between genetically controlled levels of RBC TPMT activity and RBC concentrations of 6-TGN. We found a significant negative correlation between RBC TPMT activity and 6-TGN concentrations in blood samples from 40 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving long-term therapy with 6-MP (rs = -0.474; P less than 0.005). In addition, RBC TPMT activities were significantly higher in blood samples from these patients than in blood samples from adult control subjects (P less than 0.0001) or children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were in remission but were not receiving drug therapy (P less than 0.0001). Finally, three adult patients were studied who developed very high RBC 6-TGN concentrations and thiopurine-induced leukopenia. Two of the three patients had no detectable RBC TPMT activity--presumably on a genetic basis. These results indicate that low TPMT activity may be a risk factor for the occurrence of elevated 6-TGN concentrations and for the development of severe leukopenia in patients treated with thiopurine drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Results showed markedly increased numbers of eosinophils and increased content of prostaglandin (PG) E2 in BALF obtained from the patients with eosinophilic pneumonia compared to that of normal volunteers. Interestingly, the increased content of PGE2 in BALF obtained from the patients reverted to normal range with corticosteroid treatment. This change in PGE2 content in BALF was accompanied by normalization of number and percentage of eosinophils in BALF. These findings indicated that PGE2 level in lower respiratory tract of patients with eosinophilic pneumonia may be related to an increased number of eosinophils.\r"

  ".W": "Several libraries of monoclonal antibodies have been produced against epitopes that reside on hCG, alpha hCG, and beta hCG. Having characterized them physically, we explored their use in the construction of highly specific and sensitive immunoradiometric assays. There were several important immunochemical considerations with respect to developing assays that accurately detect low levels of free subunits in serum in the presence of high concentrations of the native hormone. These include physical properties and specificities of the monoclonal antibodies, choice of capture antibody on the solid phase support, assay design, and purity of hormone standards. Using such assays, we found early pregnancy (in vitro fertilization) to be characterized by the sequential appearance of hCG, followed by beta hCG and then alpha hCG. Molar ratios of beta hCG to alpha hCG and beta hCG to hCG were highest in early gestation. However, there was a reversal of the beta hCG to alpha hCG ratio at 12-13 weeks gestation, and an excess of free alpha hCG was observed thereafter. Except for values obtained in very early pregnancy, the beta hCG to hCG ratio remained remarkably constant at approximately 0.5% throughout gestation. In contrast, choriocarcinoma was distinguished by absolute serum beta hCG concentrations 3-100 times greater than the maximum values observed during pregnancy and, more importantly, by exceedingly high beta hCG to hCG ratios. For comparison, we studied hCG, alpha hCG, and beta hCG levels in an additional 178 patients with nontrophoblastic tumors. Ectopic production of alpha hCG and beta hCG was rare (3%), and thus far, we have been unable to demonstrate the presence of hCG in such patients. Therefore, hCG and the free subunits appear not to be useful as serological markers for nontrophoblastic tumors.\r"
