We compared patterns of cellular arrangement among 50 cases of prostate carcinoma studied in histologic and cytologic specimens obtained simultaneously. Cell patterns were independently scored in a semiquantitative fashion on both histologic and cytologic material, and \"predicted Gleason scores\" were assigned to the cytologic specimens. When carcinomas were classified as well differentiated (Gleason score 2 to 4), moderately differentiated (Gleason score 5 to 7), or poorly differentiated (Gleason score 8 to 10), there was 84 per cent agreement between histology and cytology. In no instance was there overlap between well-differentiated and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the matched specimens. We believe that it is possible to accurately predict tissue patterns of prostate carcinoma and to estimate Gleason scores in aspiration biopsy specimens.\r"

  ".W": "In 81 outpatients the postvoiding residual urine (PVR) using real-time B-mode ultrasonography (3.5 MHz transducer) was measured. For the calculation of the bladder volume the formula for an ellipsoid (V = 4/3 pi X r1 X r2 X r3) was found to be most accurate in predicting the actual volume measured by in-and-out catheterization (r = 0.982). Other volume formulas, using only one diameter of the bladder, were found to be much less accurate. For any arbitrary value of PVR, used in determining clinical management, the incidence of misjudgment by ultrasound was negligibly low. We conclude, that sonographic measurement of the PVR as a quick, noninvasive method, should replace catheterization, if the basic equipment is available. Additional information, e.g., prostate size, bladder configuration, diverticula, etc., can be obtained during the procedure without additional costs or loss of time.\r"

During monotherapy, the daily doses and serum drug levels were: MEX, 621 mg/day and 3.4 microM/L; Q, 1573 mg/day and 8.3 microM/L, respectively. With combination therapy, the daily doses and serum drug levels were: MEX, 636 mg/day and 3.3 microM/L; Q, 1643 mg/day and 9.5 microM/L, respectively.

  ".W": "Twelve patients with congestive heart failure underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled study for the purpose of examining the central and regional hemodynamic effects of first-dose (1 and 2 mg/kg) oral enoximone, a new phosphodiesterase III inhibitor. Enoximone augmented cardiac output, generally through a positive chronotropic response. Indices of left ventricular contractility, specifically stroke volume, delta P/delta t, fractional shortening rate, and the duration of the preejection period, were only modestly enhanced by enoximone. At 2 mg/kg, systemic vascular resistance fell below baseline values without affecting systemic blood pressure; these parameters were not altered by the 1 mg/kg dose. Both pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance dropped below baseline and below placebo control for the 2 mg/kg dose. Enoximone at 2 mg/kg lowered right and left heart filling pressures below baseline. Examination of regional hemodynamic responses to both doses demonstrated a reduction in limb vascular resistance and an increase in limb blood flow proportional to the concomitant increase in cardiac output. Renal and hepatic-splanchnic blood flow and vascular resistances were not altered by enoximone. First-dose oral enoximone (1 and 2 mg/kg) alters hemodynamics in heart failure by predominant vasodilatation, particularly of limb-musculoskeletal and pulmonary vascular beds, some positive chronotropism, and modest positive inotropism.\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular late potentials at the end of the QRS can be detected on the body surface during sinus rhythm by recording a signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG). In patients with coronary artery disease, these late potentials have been shown to be markers for spontaneous or inducible ventricular tachycardia, or both. The short-term (before and 10 +/- 4 days after coronary revascularization) influence of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on the quantitative SAECG variables was studied in 40 patients with chronic coronary artery disease. Twenty-five of these patients had a previous myocardial infarction. In the 15 patients without previous myocardial infarction, no abnormal SAECG indexes were recorded before CABG and no change in the quantitative SAECG variables was observed after surgery. In the patients with a previous myocardial infarction, 7 (28%) had a late potential before CABG. After CABG, 5 (71%) patients remained late potential-positive, whereas the other 2 (29%) lost their late potential. The mean values of their SAECG variables improved after coronary revascularization. In the entire group of postmyocardial infarction patients, the high-frequency QRS duration had shortened (p less than 0.01) after CABG (the other SAECG indexes did not change). The postoperative arrhythmic complications (transient atrial fibrillation, new onset of ventricular couplets) tended to be more frequent in the postmyocardial infarction group and in patients with late potentials. Our findings suggest that the reported increase in ventricular arrhythmias after CABG is probably not related to a change in the arrhythmogenic substrate for ventricular reentry but is associated with changes in the arrhythmogenic milieu.\r"

The short-term outcome in the remaining 22 patients (88%) was considered unsuccessful: 7 of the 22 patients developed spontaneous sustained VT and in 19 patients, including 15 with no spontaneous VT, sustained VT was still inducible by programmed electrical stimulation 7 +/- 2 days after the intracardiac electric shock. All 22 patients were subsequently treated with other modes of antiarrhythmic therapy.

In these patients the level of sympathetic activity may be an important factor. This study evaluates the influence of isoproterenol on anterograde and retrograde pathway properties in patients with AV nodal SVT and the mechanism by which this SVT is facilitated. Group 1 consisted of 8 consecutive patients, ages 23 to 85 years (mean +/- standard error, 57 +/- 8) who had no inducible AV nodal SVT during electrophysiologic testing until isoproterenol (0.5 to 3.0 micrograms/min) was infused. These patients were compared with 6 patients in the same age range (45 to 78 years, mean +/- standard error, 64 +/- 5) who had inducible AV nodal SVT without isoproterenol and who comprised group 2. In comparing group 1 (before isoproterenol) with group 2, there was no significant difference in the refractory periods of the anterograde slow and fast pathways, although the anterograde block cycle length was longer in group 1 patients (421 +/- 18 vs 362 +/- 14 ms, p less than 0.05). The retrograde block cycle length was also longer in 7 of the 8 group 1 (before isoproterenol) patients in whom it could be measured versus those in group 2 (411 +/- 14 vs 318 +/- 27 ms, p less than 0.05). During isoproterenol, the anterograde and retrograde block cycle lengths in group 1 were not different from group 2. Therefore, AV nodal SVT may not be inducible in some patients during routine electrophysiologic testing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Long-lasting (mean 30 days) type I atrial flutter was treated with overdrive pacing in 30 patients (mean age 69 years) with organic heart disease. To evaluate the effect of pretreatment with disopyramide, the study population was divided in 3 groups of 10 patients each: group A, no disopyramide therapy; group B, intravenous disopyramide (maximum dose 250 mg in 1 hour); and group C, oral disopyramide (400 mg daily for 4 days). There were no differences in baseline cycle length of atrial flutter among the 3 groups before drugs were given. The stimulation protocol included overdrive atrial pacing up to the shortest paced cycle of 150 ms performed at a maximum of 3 atrial sites. Reversion to sinus rhythm occurred in 2 patients in group A, 7 in group B (p less than 0.01) and 5 in group C. Pacing was performed from a mean number of 2.1 sites/patient in group A, 1.2 in group B and 2.0 in group C. Atrial fibrillation occurred in 7, 3 and 4 patients, respectively. Acceleration to a faster form of atrial flutter occurred in 3, 3 and 4 patients, respectively, and reversion to sinus rhythm occurred in all patients who had intravenous disopyramide and in 1 who took the drug orally. The administration of disopyramide before overdrive pacing improved the rate of conversion to sinus rhythm and allowed an easier stimulation protocol with a lower incidence of pacing-induced atrial fibrillation. Disopyramide is beneficial when overdrive atrial pacing is performed for the treatment of long-standing atrial flutter in patients with organic heart disease.\r"

The 8 acute antiarrhythmic regimens were procainamide, quinidine, mexiletine, mexiletine + type 1A agent, flecainide or indecainide, amiodarone, amiodarone + type 1A and \"miscellaneous\" agents. At least 1 successful acute antiarrhythmic regimen was found in 47% of patients and in a significantly greater proportion of patients with ejection fraction greater than or equal to 30% (52 of 81 = 64%) than in those with ejection fraction less than 30% (43 of 120 = 36%, p less than 0.001). Drug trials were successful (initiation of less than 15 repetitive ventricular responses) in 32% of patients with ejection fraction greater than or equal to 30% versus 19% of those with ejection fraction less than 30% (p less than 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 ejection fraction groups in type of heart disease, acute antiarrhythmic dosages or mean serum drug levels. A logistic regression analysis incorporating multiple clinically relevant factors found that ejection fraction was the only factor that correlated significantly with drug success or failure (p less than 0.002). Acute antiarrhythmic drug efficacy relates to LV function per se or to other pathophysiologic mechanisms of which ejection fraction may be a marker.\r"

The brachial artery was investigated in terms of arterial section (measured by pulsed Doppler technique) and wall rigidity (assessed by pulse wave velocity). Arterial and biochemical parameters were measured in baseline before injection and at 20 to 40 minutes (t1) and 80 to 100 minutes (t2) after saline and drug injections. Compared with the saline vehicle, enalaprilat significantly decreased angiotensin enzyme converting activity (p less than 0.001), increased plasma renin activity (p less than 0.01) and decreased plasma aldosterone concentrations (p less than 0.01). The drug reduced blood pressure (p less than 0.01) and increased the brachial artery section (p less than 0.01), but did not change pulse wave velocity. In the enalaprilat group, significant postinjection relations were observed between: (1) enalaprilat concentration and plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity (r = -0.72, p less than 0.001); (2) plasma renin activity and mean blood pressure (r = -0.46, p less than 0.02); (3) plasma enalaprilat concentration and pulse wave velocity (r = -0.50, p less than 0.01) and (4) pulse wave velocity and brachial artery section (r = 0.42, p less than 0.05). Thus, the brachial artery effects of enalaprilat were not directly related to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Strain gauge plethysmography was used to measure the maximal blood flow response following release of forearm arterial occlusion and the peak reactive hyperemic blood flow response (ml/min.100 ml) before and twice after orthotopic heart transplantation in 10 subjects with severe congestive heart failure. The 2 posttransplantation studies were done before hospital discharge (mean 18 days after transplantation) and again after discharge (mean 114 days after transplantation). Transplantation led to a significant but delayed increase in maximal vasodilation (reactive hyperemic blood flow: pretransplant 21 +/- 3; predischarge 25 +/- 2; postdischarge 43 +/- 5) and a concurrent significant reduction in minimal forearm resistance. Although the improvement in peripheral vasodilator function may be linked to improvement in cardiac function, this linkage is not direct, nor is it immediate. If the normalization of maximal metabolic blood flow is related to resumption of normal physical activity postdischarge, then much of the basic abnormality in vasodilator capacity in congestive heart failure may be related to physical deconditioning.\r"

By multivariate analysis considering 16 variables, ventricular ectopic activity was independently associated with sudden death (p = 0.02 to 0.001) and total mortality (p = 0.04 to 0.0001) for an average follow-up of 25 months. By univariate analysis, ventricular ectopic activity was associated with increased total mortality (odds ratios 2.13 to 3.54) and sudden death mortality (odds ratio 2.26 to 3.93). The association of ventricular ectopic activity with mortality was observed in both high- and low-risk patient subsets with odds ratios similar to the placebo group.

  ".W": "To delineate the clinical significance and prognostic importance of a history of chronic or new onset angina pectoris before acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 732 consecutive patients admitted for a first AMI were studied and divided into 3 groups. Two hundred patients (27%) had chronic angina before AMI (greater than 1 month); 247 patients (34%) had new onset angina before AMI (less than 1 month) and the 285 remaining patients (39%) never had angina before AMI. All clinical characteristics were similar in the group of patients with chronic angina and in the group of patients with new onset angina, including in-hospital mortality (10 vs 9%) and 3-year post-hospital mortality (16 vs 16%). Compared to the 285 patients without angina, the 447 patients with angina before AMI were older, more likely to be women, and had a higher frequency of anterior AMI and early post-infarction angina. Both groups had a similar in-hospital mortality (10 vs 8%, not significant), but patients with angina had a higher 3-year post-hospital mortality (16 vs 7%, p less than 0.001). In the group of patients with angina before AMI who were discharged from the hospital, the comparison of nonsurvivors and survivors showed that the patients who died were older, presented more frequently with a non-Q-wave myocardial infarct and more often had left ventricular failure and complete bundle branch block during hospital stay. Chronic and new onset angina before AMI have the same clinical characteristics and deleterious long-term prognostic significance.\r"

Balloon mitral and aortic valvotomy are being performed for congenital and acquired stenoses, although indications and optimal techniques remain to be established. Balloon angioplasty of coarctation effectively relieves obstruction in native and post-operative aortic arch stenoses, but remains controversial due to late aneurysm formation. Balloon angioplasty of branch pulmonary artery hypoplasia and stenosis, despite a relatively low success rate and significant complications, remains the procedure of choice due to lack of better therapeutic options. Transcatheter closure of congenital and acquired vessels and defects is being performed with increasing frequency. Embolization of aortopulmonary collaterals and shunts using Gianturco coils is safe and effective in selected patients. Although Rash-kind umbrellas are most commonly used for closure of a patent ductus arteriosus, their use, especially in closing intracardiac defects, remains investigational.\r"

  ".W": "Therapeutic balloon coronary angioplasty provides a useful model for studying the effects of epicardial coronary artery occlusion in conscious humans. In addition, it is a potent model in which the effectiveness of interventions designed to ameliorate ischemia can be evaluated. Whereas intravenous beta-adrenergic blocking drugs and nitrates appear to have a limited protective effect, the regional (i.e., intracoronary) use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs and calcium antagonists seem more potent. Currently, coronary venous retroperfusion with arterial blood does not appear practical, and the intraaortic balloon is a useful adjunctive measure in relatively few patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In contrast, the direct anterograde delivery of oxygen-rich blood or fluorocarbons holds promise as a reliable means of providing local myocardial protection. If ischemia could be markedly reduced, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty might be applied safely in more high-risk clinical settings. In addition, if prolonged balloon inflation could be performed, there might be an increase in primary success rate and possibly a reduction in restenosis rate.\r"

  ".W": "Restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) occurs 4 to 6 months after the procedure in 25 to 30% of the patients. Although PTCA has become far more effective with improved primary angiographic success rates and decreased complication rates, restenosis rates have not changed since the initial experience. Recurrent arterial stenoses appear to be due to fibrocellular proliferation at the site of the initial PTCA. This proliferative response is probably due to platelet adhesion and subsequent activation of the usual tissue injury responses. Fortunately, restenosis seems to be confined to the period soon after the initial PTCA since the long-term, 3- to 8-year studies demonstrate that restenosis occurs infrequently after that. There are certain predisposing characteristics of patients for restenosis: men with a short duration of symptoms with disease of the proximal left anterior descending arteries who are diabetic and continue to smoke cigarettes after PTCA. Inadequate dilatation of the arteries by PTCA and procedures that result in smooth dilatations without any evidence of dissection are associated with increased risk of restenosis. However, most of these patient and procedural characteristics are not controllable. Studies in which procedural and postprocedural variables have been manipulated have been disappointing. Currently, no alterations in techniques or pharmacologic management have proved effective in decreasing the incidence of restenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Since the first coronary angioplasty in 1977, both the number and complexity of interventional procedures have grown dramatically. Continuous-wave and pulsed lasers may further extend the capabilities of balloon angioplasty. Fiberoptic catheters may be used to transmit continuous-wave laser energy to ablate plaque via thermal mechanisms. Pulsed laser systems (such as the excimer) are technologically more complex than the continuous-wave systems, but may prove superior in small vessels given their ability to ablate plaque with minimal associated effects. On the other hand, modifications of the fiber-optic tip, such as the placement of a metal cap, have yielded even better results than current bare fiber systems. Such laser thermal techniques have proved a useful adjunct to balloon dilatation in peripheral vessels, but further research is necessary to determine their effect on coronary arteries. New, nonlaser technologies, however, may provide simpler power sources for thermal angioplasty. Although balloon angioplasty remains the cornerstone of interventional vascular therapy, new technologies should help to further expand the indications for nonsurgical interventions.\r"

  ".W": "Major improvements in balloon and wire technology have been occurring for several years and, consequently, the approach to conventional angioplasty has been simplified. Results in isolated stenotic segments in renal circulation and within the iliac and superficial femoral vessels have generally been 95% technically successful, with 1-year patency rates of 80% in the superficial and renal sites and 90% in the iliac vessels. The procedure has been extended to include more distal vessels including the popliteal and tibial circulation as well as more complex lesions involving the mesenteric circulation and pre-Leriche syndromes with stenotic disease involving the infrarenal segment of the abdominal aorta. Successful results have also been achieved in stenotic atherosclerotic disease involving the subclavian artery and the associated subclavian steal syndromes. Preliminary results are also being reported in a few selected series of vertebral and carotid artery angioplasty. Totally occluded segments in the iliac and peripheral circulation had previously been ammenable only to surgical bypass procedures. A series of new recanalization devices are under investigational evaluation for reperfusing these totally obstructed segments. Although technical recanalization in segments as long as 20 cm can be accomplished in approximately 75% of these patients, long-term patency is totally dependent on popliteal-tibial outflow. For these reasons, diffuse disease and totally obstructive disease in the superficial femoral vessels can have recurrence rates as high as 45%, and reestablishing tibial outflow is equally as important as successfully recanalizing the totally obstructed superficial femoral vessels.\r"

Although this entity is often recognized radiologically, endoscopy provides the most accurate means for identification and classification. Many bezoars can be removed endoscopically, but some will require operative intervention. Once removed, emphasis must be placed upon prevention of recurrence. Physicians must learn to recognize and classify bezoars correctly in order to provide the most appropriate therapy in each instance.\r"

  ".W": "In summing up: salazopyrin is an effective drug, particularly in ulcerative colitis. Serious adverse effects are remarkably rare. Salazopyrin provoked an improvement in 75-80% of cases of UC. It is excellently adapted for long-term treatment and, in this respect, is clearly superior to corticosteroids. It prevents relapses, particularly if the dosage is increased. The main indication for corticosteroids in UC is for acute attacks early in the course of the disease and to influence allergic symptoms during the disease. For acute swelling of the rectum, local treatment with corticosteroids or salazopyrin is often effective. Adverse effects occur in about 15% of cases treated with salazopyrin. They are due primarily to hypersensitivity to the drug. With very few exceptions, they disappear spontaneously or are controlled by corticosteroids or by some other treatment. The allergic pulmonary changes may give rise to a modest dyspnea, which is not fatal. The cyanotic and the yellow-coloring of the skin are harmless side effects. As to sulfa crystals in the kidneys and the urine, for the most part, they can be avoided by simple treatment. Agranulocytosis is a rare complication in the course of treatment with salazopyrin. During the 35 yr that the drug has been used, only 14 cases have been published in the literature. Of this number, three have died, but the treatment of the agranulocytosis is known in only one of them. Nonpublished cases probably exist, but this number does not seem to be great in my experience. In comparison with many other drugs (certain chemotherapeutics and antibiotics), the frequency of serious side effects caused by salazopyrin is remarkably low.\r"

The prosthesis was successfully placed in eight patients, five of whom had a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). A prosthesis could not be placed in two patients, and two patients complained of a minimal but tolerable foreign body sensation. Six prostheses were custom-made. The necessity to place a prosthesis within 2 cm of or even immediately proximal to the CPM should not be considered an absolute contraindication to esophageal prosthesis placement in selected patients.

Sclerotherapy with absolute alcohol eradicated esophageal varices significantly earlier compared with ethanolamine oleate (12.9 +/- 5.2 vs 22.3 +/- 8.2 wk, respectively, p less than 0.001). The mean number of injection courses and the mean amount of sclerosant required for variceal obliteration was also significantly (p less than 0.001) less in the alcohol-injected group. Although the total number of rebleeding episodes were significantly (p less than 0.05) less in the alcohol-injected group, the frequency of rebleeding was not significantly different between the two groups (20.8% vs 30.4%, respectively, p greater than 0.05). Two (8.1%) patients died due to rebleeding in the ethanolamine-injected group, whereas in the alcohol group, none died. There was no significant difference in the frequency of complications with the two sclerosants. Besides the relative ease of rapid injection due to its aqueous nature, alcohol is readily available and relatively economical (total cost of sclerosant per patient; alcohol US $0.50, ethanolamine US $60). In conclusion, absolute alcohol appears to be a useful alternative to 5% ethanolamine oleate as a variceal sclerosant.\r"

The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amphotericin B observed with blood isolates from these patients were significantly higher than those observed with blood, sputum, or skin isolates from non-immunocompromised patients (p less than 0.01). All episodes (10 of 10) of bloodstream infection in immunocompromised patients caused by isolates with MICs greater than 0.8 micrograms/ml were fatal, versus eight of 17 episodes of bloodstream infection caused by yeasts with MICs of 0.8 micrograms/ml or less (p = 0.04). Although 15 of 26 patients received empiric treatment with amphotericin B before laboratory evidence of fungemia developed, the amphotericin B susceptibilities of their isolates were not significantly different from those of patients who had not received empiric amphotericin B treatment. It is concluded that yeast fungemia in severely immunocompromised patients is often caused by organisms resistant to the usual concentrations of amphotericin B obtainable in vivo, and that this finding is clinically significant.\r"

Compliance was more than 95 percent and no adverse effects attributable to the study drugs were observed. The overall incidence of febrile illness (67 percent) was similar between the groups; however, no gram-negative bacillary infections were observed in 31 norfloxacin recipients compared with four of 32 cotrimoxazole recipients. Furthermore, nine norfloxacin recipients had 17 gram-positive bacteremias compared with two in two cotrimoxazole recipients (p = 0.0034). Norfloxacin was more effective than cotrimoxazole for preventing acquisition of aerobic gram-negative bacilli in surveillance cultures. Neither study drug allocation nor the presence of an indwelling central venous catheter influenced outcome among the 42 patients who subsequently received empiric systemic antibiotics for suspected infection. Although gram-positive infection remains an unsolved problem, norfloxacin appears to be a safe, effective, well-tolerated alternative to cotrimoxazole for preventing gram-negative infection in neutropenic patients with acute leukemia.\r"

The patients were moderately to severely ill with numerous background disorders known to be associated with an increased risk of seizures. Fifty-two patients (3 percent) had seizures and in 16 (0.9 percent) of them the seizures were judged by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to imipenem/cilastatin. An incidence of seizure of 2 to 3 percent was noted among patients treated with other antibiotics (usually including a beta-lactam in the regimen) at times when imipenem/cilastatin was not being given. The average time of onset of seizures for patients receiving imipenem/cilastatin was seven days after start of therapy. As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, central nervous system lesions and disorders including seizures and renal insufficiency were found to be strong risk factors for seizures. Imipenem/cilastatin dosages in excess of those currently recommended by the manufacturer, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency, were also associated with an increased risk of seizures. There was an association with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection that remained statistically significant even after controlling for imipenem/cilastatin dosage as well as for the other factors indicated. A high background incidence of seizures in general in a group of severely ill patients makes it both difficult to assess the etiology of a seizure and important to consider the risk factors when choosing the appropriate dose of an antibiotic. Guidelines are presented for appropriate dosing of imipenem/cilastatin in relation to renal function, body weight, and infecting pathogen.\r"

The purpose of this paper is to summarize the data that define the extent to which the renomedullary antihypertensive action is involved in blood pressure regulation. It appears that in animals kept under physiological conditions, the renal medulla is not necessary for the maintenance of normotension, since its destruction does not usually result in hypertension. However, in animals exposed to hypertensive stimuli, the presence of renomedullary tissue appears to be the key factor in resisting the increase in blood pressure. Evidence is presented to show that inherited or acquired deficiency of renomedullary antihypertensive function may contribute to the development of various forms of hypertension. It is suggested that inherited differences in the antihypertensive capacity of the renal medulla may account for differing sensitivities of various strains of animals to hypertensive stimuli. Finally, data are presented to show that renomedullary deficiency induced by a decrease in renal perfusion pressure, which could be a consequence of hypertensive damage to renal vessels, may contribute to the increase in blood pressure in various forms of hypertension.\r"

This procedure partially prevents the fall in blood pressure that occurs when the constriction is removed from the renal artery of rats with two-kidney one-clip Goldblatt hypertension. In normal rats, chemical medullectomy causes a moderate but consistent blood pressure elevation that is dose related and associated with elevation of peripheral resistance; the venous side of the circulation is normal. The hypertension is not associated with sodium retention or with activation of the renin angiotensin system. Although vasopressin levels are elevated, the rise is only modest, and blood pressure is not reduced by a vascular AVP antagonist. It is concluded that chemical medullectomy removes the source of a humoral substance that has been shown by other workers to carry out a vasodepressor role. The chemical medullectomy model therefore offers new insights into the renomedullary vasodepressor system.\r"

These may include prostaglandins (PGE2), APRL or platelet activating factor, and the incompletely defined neutral lipid, ANRL (or medullipin), the most likely candidate for this function. The lipid droplets in the RIC apparently are the precursors of the mediator(s). Degranulation of the RIC by an experimental maneuver usually indicates increased activity of these cells. The presence of abundant well-granulated RIC in a kidney indicates a resistance of that animal to the induction of salt-sensitive forms of experimental hypertension. There is definite evidence for an extrarenal antihypertensive function of the RIC mediators, but an intrarenal effect also is considered.\r"

DI rats showed an almost complete loss of interstitial cells in their renal papillae after treatment with a high dose of vasopressin. In spite of the lack of interstitial cells, the animals concentrated their urine to the same extent as vasopressin-treated normal rats, indicating that the renomedullary interstitial cells do not have an important function in concentrating the urine. The interstitial cells returned nearly to normal within 1 week off vasopressin treatment, suggesting a rapid turnover rate of these cells. To further distinguish different populations of interstitial cells, we studied the distribution of class II MHC antigen expression in the kidneys of normal and bone-marrow depleted Wistar rats. Normal rats had abundant class II antigen-positive interstitial cells in the renal cortex and outer medulla, but not in the inner medulla (papilla). Six days after 1000 rad whole body irradiation, the stainable cells were almost completely lost, but electron microscopic morphometry showed a virtually unchanged volume density of interstitial cells in the cortex and outer medulla, as well as the inner medulla. Thus, irradiation abolished the expression of the class II antigen but caused no significant depletion of interstitial cells.\r"

  ".W": "A series of studies of the humoral renal antihypertensive system in normotensive and 2K 1C-renal antihypertensive rats is outlined. The rapid structural upward resetting of the cardiovascular system in renal hypertensive rats was associated with a structural downward resetting in the vasculature of the hypotensive clipped kidney. Unclipping of this kidney caused a pronounced release of renomedullary depressor agents, explaining the rapid normalization of pressure seen after unclipping. This normalization of pressure masks a state of pronounced functional hypotension in a structurally still hypertensive cardiovascular system, characterized by marked splanchnic vasodilatation and a lack of neurogenic counter-regulation. Only when this state has lasted long enough to normalize the structural upward resettings, characteristic of hypertension does the cardiovascular system return to normal. Further, cross-circulation techniques have shown that the humoral antihypertensive agents suppress tonic sympathetic activity, thereby inhibiting normal reflex counter-regulation of their vasodilator effects. Presumably this occurs via both vagal cardiac afferents and central actions. Further, behavior and awareness become depressed during intense and prolonged renomedullary release. Finally, experiments for which a normotensive kidney is cross-circulated from a normotensive rat suggest that the humoral renomedullary antihypertensive system has its threshold of release set so low as to contribute to normal blood pressure regulation, presumably in reciprocal balance with the renocortical renin-angiotensin system. Stepwise pressure elevations increasingly enhance release of the depressor agents from the cross-perfused kidney.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present studies were designed to determine the extent to which the natriuretic effects of AVP are secondary to volume expansion. Three groups of dogs were studied: the first was infused with AVP for 2 weeks in amounts that increased plasma levels from 3 to 15 pg/mL, while water intake was maintained constant by intravenous (iv) water infusion. The second group received the same amount of AVP and was permitted to drink ad libitum. The third group was infused with the same amount of AVP, while total body weight and volume were maintained at a constant level by use of an electronically servo-controlled water infusion system. The results showed a large increase in total body weight (+1.5 kg) and arterial pressure (mean arterial pressure (MAP); +40 mm Hg) in dogs receiving a fixed water intake. This was accompanied by a continuing natriuresis over a 2-week period and severe hyponatremia (115 mEq/L). Dogs allowed ad libitum drinking retained much less fluid (+0.5 kg). MAP was not significantly elevated, and natriuresis did not occur in this group, but hyponatremia was observed (130 mEq/L), and plasma renin activity (PRA) was suppressed. Servo-controlled dogs exhibited no change in MAP, plasma sodium, or PRA, and only a small (-15 mEq) natriuresis occurred on day 1 of AVP infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this paper, we review several studies that have investigated the potential mechanisms of this lability. Combined ganglionic and alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade reduced lability but not to control levels, indicating that the sympathetic nervous system plays a major role but is not the only mechanism involved in the generation of lability. When ganglionic blockade was combined with blockade of an endogenous humoral vasoconstrictor (vasopressin or angiotensin), lability was returned to control levels in SAD rats; however, humoral blockade alone did not alter lability. Infusion of phenylephrine or endogenous vasoconstrictors in the presence of combined neural and humoral blockade increased arterial pressure lability to levels similar to those found in rats with SAD. The neurogenic contribution to lability was further investigated by recording renal sympathetic nerve activity in conscious freely moving intact rats and rats with SAD. These studies demonstrated that one day after SAD, there was little direct correlation between transient changes in renal sympathetic nerve activity and arterial pressure lability. Thus, the evidence presented in this paper is consistent with the hypothesis that arterial pressure lability is not the direct result of unbuffered variations in sympathetic discharge but rather is produced by an interaction between neural and humoral components.\r"

Ablation of this brain area results in an acute natriuresis and an increase in blood pressure. The purposes of these experiments were to determine the mechanism of the natriuretic response and assess whether the natriuresis contributes to the decreased blood volume following AV3V ablation. Rats were instrumented with metal lesioning electrodes in the AV3V region and with catheters in the femoral artery and jugular vein. Following electrolytic lesioning or control procedures, blood pressure, heart rate, urine flow rate and urinary sodium excretion were monitored. In separate groups of animals, plasma and blood volume were measured by calculating dilution of 125I-labelled serum albumin and hematocrit. Results from these studies showed that ablation of the AV3V region resulted in a significant elevation in blood pressure (18 +/- 3 mm Hg), increase in sodium excretion (212 +/- 36 mu Eq/hour), and decrease in plasma volume (10.3 +/- 0.4 mL) compared with control-treated animals (2 +/- 4 mm Hg; 89 +/- 34 mu Eq/h, 12.0 +/- 0.5 mL). This natriuretic response was accompanied by an increased plasma aldosterone concentration. Further, prevention of the hypertensive response abolished the natriuresis. These data suggest that AV3V ablation produces an acute pressure-mediated natriuresis, resulting in decreases in plasma and blood volume.\r"

  ".W": "In this article we summarize studies of the hemodynamic and endocrine effects of desoxycorticosterone (DOC)-induced hypertension in dogs and also review new data of the action of this steroid on baroreceptors. The hemodynamic effect of subcutaneous injections of DOC to dogs, without supplementation of salt in their diet, consisted of increases in arterial pressure that were sustained for a 28-day observation period and associated with augmented cardiac output. At the early stage of the hypertensive response there was a rise in plasma Na+ concentration accompanied by increases in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of vasopressin. The activity of the peripheral renin angiotensin system, as evaluated by the longitudinal changes in plasma renin activity and plasma immunoreactive angiotensin II (irAng-II), was markedly depressed in the hypertensive dogs. In contrast, the concentration of irAngII in the CSF did not change. Additional studies of the carotid occlusion reflex in anesthetized dogs revealed an enhanced buffering baroreceptor capacity in the early (less than day 10), but not the late (greater than day 28), stages of the hypertension. The abnormality in baroreflex function may be mediated by an effect of the steroid on an activity of brain angiotensin II that influences the inhibitory interaction between high and low pressure baroreceptors. The data acquired in these studies agree with the notion that excess mineralocorticoid production causes hypertension by mechanisms that influence the neurohormonal control of blood pressure by the central nervous system.\r"

The borderline hypertensives were characterized by significantly higher blood pressure, weight, cardiac output, hematocrit and decreased density of conjunctival capillaries and venules. Sodium-sensitivity was defined as an increase in mean arterial blood pressure exceeding 5% during sodium repletion. The prevalence of sodium-sensitivity was higher in blacks than in whites and greater in hypertensives than in normotensives. Sodium-sensitive individuals were characterized by significantly increased forearm vascular resistance and decreased plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. The resemblance of these changes to those reported in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat suggests a genetic basis for the response to sodium.\r"

  ".U": "88207424\r", 
  ".W": "The plasma membrane is composed of proteins embedded in a discontinuous fashion in a lipid bilayer. These proteins maintain the integrity of the membrane and play fundamental roles as ion transport channels and as receptors for agents that regulate cell function. The membrane is therefore an important regulator of vascular smooth muscle contraction. The plasma membrane in the hypertensive animal exhibits abnormal permeability for monovalent ions and defective calcium handling. This is reflected in fewer calcium-binding sites and, as a result, in deficient membrane stabilization. These defects have been identified in several cell types, including lymphocytes, red blood cells, adipocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Evidence presented in the current review suggests that hypertension is associated with a generalized membrane defect. Abnormalities in ion transport in vascular smooth muscle cells are the most relevant to the pathogenesis of hypertension since they could be directly responsible for the rise in blood pressure. We hypothesize that the impaired stabilizing effect of calcium in vascular smooth muscle cells of hypertensive subjects renders the membrane more excitable and that this in turn leads to increased vascular reactivity and higher peripheral resistance. Peripheral vascular reactivity usually is increased in hypertension, suggesting increased responsiveness of the smooth muscle cells. Possible abnormalities of the several components of the contractile process of these cells have been investigated for the role they might play in this altered response. Abnormalities in the plasma membrane have been most clearly defined and are emphasized in this review.\r"

Transmembrane Ca2+ movements are also numerous but clearly defined by a reduction in Ca2+ binders, a hypersensitivity of membrane phospholipase C, possible increased Ca2+ leak and reduced sensitivity of the Ca2+-pump to calmodulin. The resulting Ca2+ increase within arterial cells can be responsible for increased contractility and tone, leading to hypertension. These functional alterations in membrane transport can be secondary to a few well-defined membrane defects of genetic origin or to a diffuse structural perturbation in membranes involving lipid changes.\r"

Southern blot analysis documents c-myc gene amplification in JEG-3 cells, with a gene copy number of approximately 20. The methylation pattern and genomic structure of the amplified c-myc oncogene in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells are identical to those of normal placenta. Treatment of JEG-3 cells with mithramycin, a ribonucleic acid synthesis inhibitor, results in a dramatic decrease in c-myc expression relative to that of the c-Ha-Ras gene. The apparent selectivity of mithramycin for c-myc expression represents the only example, to date, of the selective pharmacologic modulation of oncogene expression.\r"

In 12 of the 17 cases (71%) the first intravascular transfusion was performed at 26.5 weeks' gestation or earlier. Thirty-nine of 45 attempted transfusions (87%) were successfully performed. All were done percutaneously under ultrasonic guidance. Two procedures were partial exchanges, while the remainder were straight transfusions. Thirteen of the 17 fetuses (76%) were alive at birth and survived the neonatal period. Four fetuses died in utero at 25 to 26 weeks' gestation, all within 12 hours of an intravascular transfusion. When the 27 procedures attempted during the most recent 9 months of this series were compared with the 18 procedures attempted during the preceding 18 months, no appreciable differences in technical success or fetal outcome were evident. An analysis of this experience is presented, along with modifications in technique that have been implemented. Unresolved issues are discussed.\r"

The original epidemiologic observations showed an inverse association between calcium intake and incidence of eclampsia after adjusting by several confounding factors. A series of recent randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a reduction in blood pressure with calcium supplementation in animals, in healthy and mildly hypertensive subjects, and in pregnant women. It is hypothesized that parathyroid hormone plays a role since it is affected by calcium intake and can partially regulate the concentration of free cytosolic ionized calcium, thus triggering smooth muscle contraction. Randomized clinical trials showing a reduction in the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension with calcium supplementation have not as yet been published. However, preliminary observations appear to support this hypothesis.\r"

Total protein of less than 3 gm/dl, albumin less than 2 gm/dl, and a hematocrit level of less than 15% were associated with hydrops fetalis. After hydrops was reversed, total protein greater than 3 gm/dl, albumin greater than 2 gm/dl, along with a sustained hematocrit level of greater than 15%, were found. Only three neonates were born with minimal ascites, two of whom had had intraperitoneal transfusions before intravascular treatments. There were 21 survivors of the total group, giving an overall survival rate of 82%. There was one neonatal death from severe respiratory distress syndrome. Thirty-eight percent of the neonates did not require exchange transfusions in the newborn period. Intrauterine intravascular transfusions appear to be an effective mode of therapy in severe erythroblastosis fetalis and not only increase survival rates but also decrease neonatal morbidity and mortality.\r"

In the original switching system identified in C. albicans, it was demonstrated that cells could switch at frequencies as high as 10(-2) among seven distinct colony phenotypes including smooth, star, ring, stipple, irregular wrinkle, hat, and fuzzy. In a second switching system first discovered in a systemic infection, cells switched at high frequency between a white and an opaque colony former. Recently, switching was discovered in isolates from patients with vaginal candidiasis and multiple switch phenotypes were cloned from an individual vagina. Switching may contribute to the pathogenesis of C. albicans by providing it with the capacity to invade diverse sites in the body, to change resistance to antifungal agents, or to change antigenicity. The molecular basis of switching is probably due to the reversible transposition or rearrangement of genomic elements, although a direct correlation between recently identified genomic rearrangements and phenotypic switching has not been made.\r"

Although some subtypes of non-QMI display a favorable early or in-hospital prognosis, the long-term outlook seems less benign, particularly when early or late recurrence of MI occurs. Coronary arteriograms show an equal number of diseased vessels in both types of MI, but complete coronary artery occlusion is less frequent in non-QMI. The management of patients with non-QMI should be mainly directed to preventing extension or recurrence of MI by using either drugs such as thrombolytic agents and drugs against coronary artery spasm or invasive techniques like percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "The responses of hypovolemic patients would be expected to be similar to experimental animals that were hypovolemic. Normovolemic patients would be expected to respond as do the normovolemic experimental animals. Hypovolemic patients do not necessarily respond the same as do normovolemic patients or volunteers. The amount of external pressure applied by the device is directly proportional to the amount of tissue pressure increase. Tissue pressure is transmitted to the vessel as reduction transmural pressure, or in change in the size of the vessels and subsequent increase in SVR. Patient response to external pressure varies with the amount of device pressure. The optimal pressure of the PASG is in the range of 60 to 80 torr. Although exceeding this value does not appear to be necessary, it is not harmful in the short term (less than 90 minutes). Using less pressure reduces the SVR and, therefore, the blood pressure response. Keeping the external pressure at approximately 40 torr appears to be ideal for hemorrhage control. Of the more than 300 articles that have appeared in the recent literature addressing the PASG, at least 190 have discussed specific scientific experiments in the animal laboratory, in the human laboratory, or in the clinical environment, in which results gathered addressed how, why, or if the PASG worked. These studies demonstrate that the PASG does, in fact, improve blood pressure, control hemorrhage, improve carotid and upper body blood flow, improve the ability of the prehospital provider to start IV lines, and improve survival (particularly short-term) with few hospital and even fewer prehospital complications. The device produces its blood pressure response by improving preload, increasing SVR, and mobilizing some blood (500 to 1,000 mL) to the upper body compartment above the device. These responses are most probably produced by decreasing the radius of the vessels compressed by the device, decreasing the compartment volume, and differentially affecting the blood flow without and within the device. Hemorrhage is controlled by increasing the external pressure on the vessel by the transmitted increased tissue pressure, reducing the vascular lumen, and reducing the area of the laceration. Short-term survival is improved by decreasing intra-abdominal hemorrhage and improving perfusion (maintaining better oxygenation in the heart-brain-lung circulation.) Long-term survival is improved because the device controls hemorrhage, maintains blood pressure, and allows delivery of the severely injured patient to the trauma center and within the hospital while awaiting an OR, as in the case of a leaking aortic aneurysm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In this study we used the inhibition of [35 S]methionine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein in vitro as an assay to test the susceptibilities of three different pathogenic treponemal strains to various antibiotics. In general, the results correlated very well with the known efficacies of these antibiotics in treating human patients with syphilis. One of the strains tested, however, a clinical isolate of T. pallidum designated street strain 14, was found to exhibit high-level resistance to erythromycin and a closely related macrolide, roxithromycin (RU 965). Street strain 14 was originally isolated from a human patient with active secondary syphilis who failed to respond to erythromycin therapy. Thus, our results indicate that an erythromycin-resistant strain of T. pallidum can be responsible for erythromycin treatment failure. In addition, street strain 14 treponemes were found to be generally less susceptible by this assay to a variety of antibiotics than were treponemes of the T. pallidum Nichols strain. These findings suggest that the outer envelope of street strain 14 treponemes may be generally less permeable to antibiotics than is that of Nichols strain treponemes.\r"

A combination made of equal parts of quinine, quinidine, and cinchonine was found to have several interesting features; it had activity similar to that of quinine against quinine-susceptible strains but was found to be 2 to 10 times more effective against strains resistant to quinine and had a more consistent effect than any of the alkaloids used singly. The potentiation was found to depend mainly on the presence of cinchonine in the mixtures studied. Synergism was also confirmed in a study of 25 P. falciparum strains isolated from Thai patients. Combinations of cinchona bark alkaloids could thus be of interest in areas where P. falciparum is becoming less susceptible to quinine.\r"

The pharmacologic effect of an antibiotic is believed to be related to its unbound concentration at the site of infection. It is unknown whether antibiotics with a low degree of serum protein binding are clinically superior to antibiotics that are highly protein bound. In a randomized, crossover investigation, the serum bactericidal activities of a single dose of ceftazidime (30 mg/kg) and cefoperazone (30 mg/kg) were studied in six healthy volunteers against three clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for which both antibiotics had similar MICs and MBCs. Serum samples were collected over 12 h. The total and unbound antibiotic concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Mean peak total concentrations of ceftazidime and cefoperazone in serum were 101.7 +/- 18.6 and 264.1 +/- 149.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. Due to its lower protein binding (21 +/- 6%), ceftazidime had significantly higher unbound concentrations in serum than did the highly bound cefoperazone (91.5 +/- 2%). Mean peak unbound concentrations were 78.5 +/- 12.5 and 24.2 +/- 17.8 micrograms/ml for ceftazidime and cefoperazone, respectively. The unbound concentration of ceftazidime at each sampling time was higher than that of cefoperazone. Although total concentrations were consistently higher than the MICs, serum containing cefoperazone showed minimal bactericidal activity against the isolates. In contrast, despite lower total concentrations, ceftazidime had greater antibacterial activity than cefoperazone. Serum bactericidal activity was more closely related to unbound rather than total antibiotic concentrations. Our data support the concept that only the unbound drug is microbiologically active.\r"

T. gondii growth was quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which was performed directly on the fixed cultures, using a rabbit anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin G as the first antibody and a phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G as the second antibody. Optical density values were highly correlated with the number of T. gondii organisms in the Giemsa-stained cultures (r = 0.89), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to assess the effect of antimicrobial agents at various concentrations. For each drug, regression models were used to quantify the relationship between optical density values and antimicrobial agent concentrations in the cultures. A significant inhibitory effect was found with pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine for concentrations greater than or equal to 0.05 and 30 micrograms/ml, respectively. With spiramycin, a progressive increase in inhibition of T. gondii was observed for increasing concentrations from 1 to 100 micrograms/ml. Ornidyl (difluoromethylornithine) and (2R,5R)-6-heptyne-2,5-diamine, which are ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors, were found to have a marked inhibitory effect for concentrations greater than or equal to 25 and 2 mM, respectively. This proposed method was sensitive and easy to perform and does not require the use of radiolabeled compounds; since it allows experimental design on replicate cultures and can be partially automated, it thus may prove useful for the systematic screening of the activity of new compounds against T. gondii.\r"

Purified salts of the LPSs from the parent strain, UB1005, and from one of the mutant strains, DC1, bound similar amounts of sodium and magnesium, but the samples from the second mutant strain, DC2, had significantly greater amounts of counterions bound per phosphate than did the other two isolates. The 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicated that, compared with LPS from the parental strain, the sample from strain DC1 was similar but the DC2 sample contained fewer diphosphodiester and more diphosphomonoester groups. Motion within the lipid A head group regions of the magnesium salts of the three isolates was dramatically different, as revealed by an electron spin resonance probe. The binding of the cations to the LPS aggregates was measured by the displacement of this cationic spin probe from the LPS samples. The polycations polymyxin, gentamicin, and spermine displaced more probe from samples of the two mutant strains than from that of the parental strain. The sample from the most antibiotic-susceptible strain, DC2, had the highest affinity for all the polyvalent cations tested. The results indicate that antibiotic hypersusceptibility can result from at least two distinct alterations in LPS structure. The decrease in diphosphodiesters and increase in diphosphomonoesters in the LPS of the DC2 sample resulted in more acidic phosphate moieties and a more antibiotic-susceptible cell. In contrast, the alterations in the LPS of DC1 that resulted in antibiotic hypersusceptibility of the cell were not in the phosphate substituents. In both mutants, however, hypersusceptibility resulted in an alteration in LPS structure that increased the affinity of the molecules for polycations.\r"

Three of these proteins (the 69,000-Mr protein [69K protein] and the 70K and 78K proteins) and trace amounts of the 73K and 75K proteins were induced in the OM of bacteria infecting the peritoneal cavity of rabbits. Addition of iron either to the growth medium in vitro or to the peritoneum in vivo repressed the expression of these proteins. Cephaloridine had no significant effect on the OMP profiles. An additional 56,000-Mr protein was observed in the OM of bacteria cultivated in vivo in the presence of CGP 17520 and also to a lesser extent in vivo under conditions of iron excess. A difference in recognition of OM antigens between cells grown in vitro and in vivo was observed by immunoblotting techniques. The 26K, 27.5K, and 28.5K antigens present in the OM of cells grown in vitro (but not in vivo) were recognized by antibodies raised against bacteria cultivated in vitro under conditions of iron depletion, but were not recognized by antisera raised against bacteria harvested directly from infections. Antisera raised against a nonencapsulated K. pneumoniae strain caused no agglutination of encapsulated K. pneumoniae grown in vivo in the absence of cephalosporins. Rapid agglutination was observed with this antiserum when the same encapsulated strain was grown in vivo in the presence of either cephalosporin, indicating less occlusion of critical antigens by the capsule.\r"

We present the first report of follicular cutaneous GVHD. Three patients developed follicular papules simulating bacterial or fungal folliculitis as a major clinical expression of cutaneous involvement in acute GVHD following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. In each case, histopathologic examination demonstrated features of acute graft-vs-host reaction involving hair follicles. This suggests that follicular epithelium may be an early target in acute GVHD.\r"

By light microscopy and immunohistochemistry, both types of tumors showed features of capillary hemangiomas. By electron microscopy, a peculiar finding of subcutaneous hemangiomas was the presence of slender abluminal processes of endothelial cells that were frequently anastomosing to form electron-lucent blebs. Although the precise etiopathogenesis of the vascular proliferations remains speculative, these lesions merit study since they constitute an easily recognizable marker of POEMS syndrome.\r"

Side effects were seen in four patients--two with asymptomatic mild hypotension, one with renal insufficiency which improved with a reduction in dose, and one with severe oliguria progressing to renal failure.

Patient triggered ventilation was maintained for up to eight hours (mean duration five hours). In 13 of 14 infants oxygenation improved and this was associated in most with an increase in rate of delivered positive pressure inflations and inflating volumes. A greater improvement in oxygenation was shown when trigger mode was used during the recovery phase of respiratory distress syndrome. Only one infant, who made very little respiratory effort, failed to improve. We conclude that patient triggered ventilation may be used as an effective form of neonatal ventilation.\r"

Glucose-containing priming solutions profoundly elevated plasma glucose levels during and after bypass graft surgery. In diabetic patients who received glucose primes, intraoperative peak plasma glucose levels averaged 696 +/- 48 mg/dl as compared with 341 +/- 17 mg/dl in diabetic patients who received nonglucose primes (p less than 0.001). Despite an insulin infusion, diabetic patients underwent a much slower decline in plasma glucose levels postoperatively over a 2-hour period than did nondiabetics (who did not receive an insulin infusion). We conclude that during and immediately after coronary artery bypass surgery in diabetic patients, it is desirable to avoid administration of glucose-containing priming solutions, since such solutions profoundly elevate plasma glucose levels.\r"

Previous reports have emphasized the wide range of conditions for which this approach is suitable, but advances in the technique and design of stapling devices and routine use of the double-lumen endotracheal tube have further enhanced its indications. We have reviewed 54 consecutive patients who have undergone transaxillary thoracotomy over a 2 1/2-year period. The wide range of procedures performed up to and including pneumonectomy indicates the versatility of the approach. We now consider transaxillary thoracotomy to be the incision of choice for most pulmonary and mediastinal lesions and an attractive alternative to mediastinoscopy for the identification and staging of chest tumors.\r"

Stroke is the major risk for patients undergoing myocardial revascularization in the presence of symptomatic carotid artery disease or an asymptomatic carotid bruit that reflects an ulcerative lesion or stenosis exceeding 75%. However, patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis should not routinely undergo prophylactic carotid endarterectomy. Myocardial infarction is the major hazard in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy who have coronary artery disease. This risk is magnified when the disease is silent. A high level of awareness and rigorous screening are essential in all patients suspected of having coexistent disease. Although a protocol for the management of these patients is important, individual assessment is essential.\r"

Following bone marrow transplantation, decreased plasma levels of total thyroxine and triiodothyronine and impaired response of thyrotropic cells to thyrotropin-releasing hormone were observed. These alterations reverted to normal in nine months and none of the patients was hypothyroid at the end of follow-up. The damage to thyrotropic cells appears to be selective because the secretion of prolactin was not impaired and that of gonadotropins even increased, as a consequence of gonadal failure. Longer follow-up is needed to determine if this irradiation protocol, which prevents the complication of permanent primary hypothyroidism and does not cause any destruction of thyroid cells, may increase the risk of irradiation-related thyroid tumors.\r"

To see how the public and nontransplant physicians view these issues, we surveyed samples of these groups in Rochester, NY. We found that the majority of respondents supports the use of unrelated donors and believes that donors should be allowed to accept added risk. Our findings were confirmed by a Gallup Poll of a random sample of the US adult population. It appears that many transplant centers are out of step with public opinion, as well as that of other members of the medical profession. We hope our data will induce the centers to become more attuned to public attitudes and give donors a greater voice in determining their own suitability. If this occurs, more donors will likely become available and the number of patients with end-stage renal disease receiving transplants will increase.\r"

The patients were followed up clinically and ultrasonically 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. If the cyst recurred, a repeated treatment was offered. Cure was defined as the absence of any residual nodule and an ultrasonic cyst volume of less than 1 mL 12 months after the last treatment. During follow-up, two patients without recurrence after saline treatment and six patients without recurrence after tetracycline treatment developed solid cold nodules. Fourteen (47%) of 30 patients in the saline group and ten (43%) of 23 patients in the tetracycline group were cured (not statistically significant). Tetracycline does not seem to offer any advantage over isotonic saline in the treatment of thyroid cysts, and some of these patients still need thyroid surgery.\r"

Frequent catheter manipulation and prolonged use favored the development of fungemia in both patients. A review of the literature revealed 19 additional cases over the course of four decades, all in hosts with underlying diseases. Thirteen of these cases have been described in the last 18 months, suggesting either increased recognition or increased frequency of infection with this organism. All tested isolates have been susceptible to amphotericin B. Patients have generally responded to catheter withdrawal and amphotericin B administration. Hansenula anomala is an opportunistic pathogen, whose clinical behavior resembles that of Candida species.\r"

A review of the world literature resulted in the identification of 113 previously reported cases. Cutaneous melanoma is the neoplasm most frequently metastasizing to the larynx, but adenocarcinoma may also often occur, especially from renal origin. A correct differential diagnosis from primary laryngeal cancer is most important. Identification of tumor location beneath intact mucosa, use of particular biochemical and histochemical stains, and electron microscopy may assist in establishing the presence of a metastatic growth. The prognosis is almost generally unfavorable because laryngeal involvement often occurs with metastases to other organs.\r"

Osteogenic sarcoma was the predominant histologic type (58%), followed by fibrosarcoma (21%) and various other sarcomas (21%). The average latency period between irradiation and development of the second primary (sarcoma) was 12.4 years. Irrespective of irradiation, a genetic linkage between retinoblastoma and osteogenic sarcoma on the 13q14 chromosome is recognized. Through a pleiotropic effect of this same chromosome, a predisposition for other sarcomas may exist as well. Finally, a strong role for radiation induction is proposed for all of these postirradiation sarcomas. This is based on the increased number of sarcomas arising in the field of prior irradiation (sites uncharacteristic of spontaneously occurring primary sarcomas) and the prolonged latency periods.\r"

We describe three patients with long-standing active RAS treated with oral colchicine. All patients experienced a marked decrease in symptoms and a remission of the disease. Recurrences, however, occurred within three days of discontinuation of the therapy. In one patient, colchicine therapy was discontinued because of persistent diarrhea. In another, a second remission was more difficult to achieve on the same regimen. The literature on the subject is reviewed, and the beneficial effects of colchicine therapy are discussed in relation to the immunopathogenesis of this disease. We conclude that colchicine therapy should be considered as an alternative in the treatment of the major or persistent form of RAS.\r"

It was also confirmed that the rabbit serum in the immunofluorescence (IF) studies contained several isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) including LAV, HTLV-III, ARV and YU-6 similarly as human reference antibodies. The neutralizing capacity of this antiserum to HTLV-III and YU-6 isolates was further studied using three methods, such as 3[H]-thymidine uptake in HIV infected MT-4 cells, IF assay, and plaque forming assay. All experiments showed that the rabbit antiserum could not neutralize YU-6 but HTLV-III, while human sera neutralized both viruses equally. These data suggest that rabbit antibody recognizes narrower neutralizing epitopes than HIV-infected human antibodies, although there exist no differences as to recognition of antigens responsible for IF between them. Furthermore, we showed that this type-specific neutralization was not due to the absorption of neutralizing serum by the noninfectious viral particles. These data may be important in understanding heterogeneities of HIV and in development of an effective vaccine.\r"

The standard principle of the Doppler-echographic determination of volume flow rate is based upon the assessment of three quantities: the vascular cross-section, the angle of incidence of the ultrasound relative to the direction of the velocity vector, and the cross-sectional average velocity. In the literature reporting comparisons between Doppler and invasive cardiac output measurements, correlation coefficients ranging from 0.8 to 0.95 are given for adult patients. Error limits of less than 20% for individual measurements, however, require a skillful investigator, a high quality instrument, and an appropriate subject. From a technical point of view, the highest accuracy is achieved by directing the ultrasound beam parallel to the flow, by measuring the true cross-sectional area instead of the diameter, and in the presence of well-behaved transluminal blood velocity distributions.\r"

This limits the anaesthetist's knowledge of the direct effects of commonly used anaesthetics. A discrimination between a negative inotropic effect and changes in pre- and afterload is usually impossible in clinical conditions. By using needle force probes, it is now possible to measure intramyocardial mesh tension in volumes as small as 3 mm3. Force mapping in 20 to 30 layers of the hearts of five normal dogs has shown that there are different patterns in the basal, middle and apical portions of the free wall of the left ventricle. An inhomogeneity is also observed when myocardial hypertrophy is produced by a 6-week period of aortic banding. However, this decreased the gradient in wall tension between the basal and the other portions of the ventricle. Inhomogeneities in wall tension increase the difficulty of assessing the contractile state of heart muscle. It may, however, be useful to compare local wall dynamics in the more isometrically-contracting basal segment with those in the middle portion which brings about most of the emptying of the ventricle. In the future, transoesophageal echocardiography may be used to measure variations in wall thickness which change the global loading conditions in the basal midwall compartments of the left ventricle.\r"

As a rule, the measurements yield global values. Discrimination between the integrity of different cellular compartments and individual cell functions is difficult and possible only in particular circumstances. Metabolism is not a static, but a dynamic cellular activity. Status analyses are like stills from a movie. With the present state of the art, however, it seems neither possible nor justified to describe or predict functional performance of the heart using analyses of metabolism, which can be performed simply, rapidly, reliably and with general validity. The best way to assess functional performance is to measure function! Metabolism and metabolites are the fuel and constituent parts of structure and its functions. Because of this, there must be a link between function, structure and metabolic activities and metabolite patterns. The successful symptomatic therapy of myoadenylate deaminase deficiency in patients by administration of ribose [20, 21] is just one good example of the relation between metabolism and function, and of the value of subtle studies of metabolism and analyses of metabolic patterns in animals and in man.\r"

  ".W": "Research in chronically instrumented experimental animals has shown basal anaesthesia may cause a considerable disruption of the autonomic control of the cardiovascular system, and a profound change in basal haemodynamics, myocardial function and coronary haemodynamics--variables which are of fundamental importance in studying the impact of various anaesthetics on the cardiovascular system. It is, therefore, important to make sequential haemodynamic measurements which enable comparisons to be made of the conscious v. the anaesthetized state. The present article describes some of the chronic instrumentation techniques used to study the effects of anaesthetic agents on overall haemodynamics, coronary blood flow and regional myocardial function in comparison with the conscious state. It is suggested that the effects of anaesthesia on the integrative control of the circulation are not sufficiently recognized.\r"

  ".U": "88209396\r", 
  ".W": "The derivation of the \"cardiac output\" in man is fraught with difficulties whatever principle of measurement is used. The theories underlying the principles involved are sound; the problem arises in their application to the measurement in man. Of equal moment are the immense practical difficulties in applying the techniques available. Together these difficulties frequently give rise to unacceptable errors in the derivation of the \"cardiac output\". There is no \"gold standard\" of measurement; all methods have inherent difficulties in their application to man. If intense attention is paid to the practice of any one of the techniques available, then it is possible to reduce the variability of the measurement to acceptable proportions, but the conditions necessary to obtain such narrow ranges of variability in the human subject rarely obtain in routine clinical practice. These realizations apply to the techniques available at present, and it is difficult to imagine that there will be further development of the invasive methods available which would negate these. In contrast, it is possible that refinement of some of the non-invasive techniques now being introduced will allow reasonably reliable measurement of the cardiac output with greater facility than is possible at present. Finally, this brings into question the whole objective of the utility of measurement of cardiac output in practice. Frequently it is measured without due deference to its usefulness. Doubtless there are situations in which the measurement of cardiac output may be of scientific, if not of individual clinical benefit, for example the influence of drugs in hypertension and heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 15 babies with congenital heart block, 10 of 10 who were less than 3 months old possessed antibody. Antibody titres in affected but not in normal infants were lower compared with their mothers' titres, suggesting deposition of antibodies in the baby's tissues.

Of the other 68 cases, 16 had inadequate data for analysis, 21 had evidence of a storage disease other than Kufs' disease, 10 did not have clear evidence of any neuronal storage, and 21 had atypical clinical features considered outside the spectrum of Kufs' disease. The 50 cases accepted as Kufs' disease comprised two clinical phenotypes; progressive myoclonus epilepsy (Type A) and dementia with motor disturbances (Type B). Marked photosensitivity was a striking feature of some Type A cases, and facial dyskinesias were common amongst Type B patients. Onset was typically at around the age of 30 years. A few cases began in adolescence; these differ from the protracted juvenile form of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis by the absence of visual failure. Demonstration of fingerprint profiles or granular osmiophilic deposits by electron microscopy is mandatory for definitive diagnosis. Urinary sediment dolichol levels were markedly elevated in our 2 cases. This biochemical finding confirms the relationship of Kufs' disease to the early forms of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis and is consistent with our hypothesis that these diseases are due to defects in the intracellular processing of lysosomal and related membranes.\r"

Identifying the patients at risk remains a major challenge. Those who have recurrent ventricular tachycardia or have been resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation are generally considered to be at highest risk. Although ventricular premature beats in the absence of previous ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation are not helpful in identifying such patients in most cases, they can indicate increased risk for sudden cardiac death in the presence of a structural cardiac abnormality, particularly recent myocardial infarction; however, the need for treatment in such cases is speculative and is being investigated. Treatment is mandatory for survivors of an episode of ventricular fibrillation and those with recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia or torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia. The approach to management is either invasive or noninvasive. Selection of an antiarrhythmic agent is facilitated by knowledge of some basic electrophysiologic features of the heart and of the classification of antiarrhythmic drugs. However, drug therapy has to be individualized on the basis of efficacy, left ventricular function and adverse effects or potential adverse effects of the drug. Amiodarone therapy or nonpharmacologic therapy should be considered if a suitable antiarrhythmic agent cannot be found.\r"

The sensitivity of the kit in the laboratory was 80% for all specimens and 94% for specimens with more than 10 colony-forming units of group A streptococci; the specificity was 99%. After initial training, emergency department pediatricians and nurses achieved sensitivities of 72% and 69% respectively. The specificity achieved by the pediatricians was 76% initially but 96% after further training. Untrained residents achieved a sensitivity of 58%. We conclude that this kit is potentially useful in the hands of adequately trained personnel, but without training the accuracy of the results is unacceptable. We recommend that the kit be used by designated staff trained and monitored by laboratory personnel.\r"

When human leukocyte suspensions artificially contaminated with mammary tumor cells were tested by MBr1 immunofluorescence, it was demonstrated that the added tumor cells could be specifically discriminated from normal cells and that as little as one tumor cell in 200,000 could be detected. With the same methodology we screened bone marrow biopsies from breast cancer patients with apparently uninvolved lymph nodes at the moment of surgery. Immunoreactive tumor cells were detected by the MBr1 antibody in 17% of N- patients. None of the bone marrow samples showed any evidence of tumor involvement by conventional histologic analysis.\r"

Labeled cells were detected in excised tumor specimens by indirect immunoperoxidase staining using anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody as the first antibody. The BrdU labeling index (LI, defined as the percentage of labeled cells in relation to the total number of cells scored) was calculated for each specimen. All four spinal cord ependymomas had a BrdU LI of less than 1%, which is consistent with our clinical experience that most such tumors grow slowly and have an excellent prognosis. Five of the eight intracranial ependymomas also had a low BrdU LI of approximately 1% or less, and three had a BrdU LI of 3.2%, 3.4%, and 4.8%. The latter three tumors, only one of which was diagnosed as a malignant ependymoma at the time of study, were either recurrent or recurred within 2 years after gross or subtotal removal. Cytologic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was performed in five cases; CSF seeding of tumor cells was found in only one patient, who had a malignant ependymoma. A high BrdU LI did not always correlate with CSF seeding. Measurement of the LI using BrdU and anti-BrdU monoclonal antibodies can provide more accurate information on the proliferative potential of individual tumors and may lead to a more rational grading system of ependymomas. The results of such studies do not always predict the potential for CSF seeding.\r"

For all treatment groups combined, the RR of SC was 2.1 (95% confidence limits: 1.8 to 2.4).

In the chemotherapy alone group, none of the RR differed significantly from unity, and the RR for SC of all sites was 1.1 (95% confidence limits: 0.5 to 1.9).

Thirty variables were systematically evaluated. The following parameters had a predictive value for the development of chronic CSA-nephrotoxicity: number of CSA-induced episodes of acute deterioration of renal function, CSA trough level (day 0-30, day 31-90), number of unexplained episodes of acute deterioration of renal function, number of nephrotoxic drugs, number of rejection treatments, number of rejection episodes and primary poor renal function. The results indicate that all factors leading to acute renal failure, favor the development of CSA-nephrotoxicity.\r"

Patients were classified into three groups according to their transplant function, as characterized by the serum creatinine concentration (CR). A comparison with normal subjects (n = 20) and with patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD, n = 46) revealed a complete normalization of all carnitine plasma fractions for group I patients (Cr less than 120 mumol/l). In contrast, significant elevations of plasma free and esterified carnitine were found in group II (Cr greater than 120, less than 200 mumol/l; with FC + 27%, SCC + 82%, and LCC + 49% and group III patients (Cr greater than 200 mumol/l; with FC + 39%, SCC + 122%, and LCC + 106%), as compared to healthy subjects (p less than 0.001). The elevations in concentrations of SCC were more pronounced than those of FC; consequently, we found a higher ratio of acylcarnitine (AC) to FC in group III than in group I patients (+ 41%, p less than 0.001). Yet even in the former group, this ratio was found to be markedly reduced when compared to HD patients (-41%, p less than 0.001). We found no significant differences in the urinary excretion of FC and SCC between the 3 groups of KT patients. It is thus to conclude that in patients with a well-functioning transplant, the pattern of carnitine fractions in plasma is fully normalized. The decrease in the ratio of AC to FC following a successful KT might suggest a better availability of FC and thereby be associated with an enhanced fatty acid oxidation.\r"

If surgery is decided upon, this article suggests a plan to accomplish the reduction of the fracture and decompression of the neural elements. The fractures are divided into compression injuries, seat belt injuries, fracture-dislocations, and burst fractures. In each case the goal is to realign and stabilize the spine and allow adequate room for the spinal cord or the cauda equina. A burst fracture requires the most careful planning. Some decompression can be accomplished by distraction alone but impaction of the fragments posteriorly or removal of the fragments anteriorly may be required. The experience at the author's university has demonstrated that by using these techniques, the preoperative neurocanal compromise can be significantly improved over those series using posterior distraction alone. If canal compromise cannot be accomplished posteriorly, then anterior surgery is required.\r"

In the other type, where the volar plate is completely displaced over the proximal phalangeal neck, the deformity of the toe is extreme as the IP joint is locked in hyperextension. In the former type, the dislocation is often misinterpreted to have been repositioned manually because of relatively slight deformity. In either type of dislocation, the volar plate is detached from both the distal and proximal phalanges, and so displaced into the joint, as to form a barrier to manual repositioning. Open reduction is mandatory.\r"

Union was obtained in 11 of 12 patients and in one patient with a repeat stabilization and implantation of h-BMP. Four patients received autogeneic cancellous bone graft and four patients received allogeneic bone grafts. The BMP implant was prepared in the form of an aggregate of h-BMP and bone matrix water-insoluble noncollagenous proteins (h-BMP/iNCP). Fifty to 100 mg of h-BMP/iNCP was either implanted in the fracture gap in ultra thin gelatin capsules, or incorporated in a strip of polylactic/polyglycolic acid copolymer (PLA/PGA) and placed as an onlay across the fracture gap. The average time to union was 4.7 months. Further clinical investigations are planned as a series of matched cases with and without BMP augmentation in order to distinguish h-BMP effects from new or improved methods of fracture fixation combined with autogeneic cancellous bone grafts.\r"

Transplantation of composite grafts composed of BM and DBM showed the first signs of fusion between two spinal segments after four weeks, reaching 86% after 20 weeks. Late fusion results achieved with DBM alone were similar. The capacity of BM per se to build up a spinal fusion was insignificant. Calcified tissue, documented roentgenographically, was shown to develop locally with time, and the earliest bridging of an interspace was noted after four weeks. Histologically, formation of new bone and cartilage was observed after two weeks, showing mature lamellar bone formation between thoracic segments after 20 weeks. Furthermore, increased 45Ca activity was still observed in the fused tissues after 20 weeks. Although, with grafting materials used, this model for experimental spinal fusion gave promising results, further investigations with other fusion techniques could give still better effects.\r"

While scaphoid fractures as a group show a 90%-95% union rate, those fractures with greater than 1 mm of displacement are associated with a 55% incidence of nonunion and a 50% rate of avascular necrosis. Displaced fractures that unite spontaneously do so only after prolonged immobilization and are associated with a greater incidence of painful malunion. Displaced scaphoid fractures that result in malunion or nonunion are more prone to develop late carpal osteoarthritis. The higher incidence of complications with the displaced scaphoid fracture suggests that an anatomic reduction is essential. If closed manipulation is unsuccessful, open reduction and internal fixation are indicated.\r"

Although the \"average\" tibial fracture is effectively managed without surgery, patients with such injuries frequently have prolonged convalescence and unsatisfactory anatomic and functional results. This review of recent literature reveals that in appropriately chosen patients, surgical fixation of unstable closed tibial fractures produces faster recovery and less residual disability or deformity. This is especially true when intramedullary nailing is indicated, as in transverse, short oblique, or segmental fractures. Plate and screw fixation is preferable for metaphyseal fractures. External fixation may be safest when soft tissue crushing is extensive, especially if fasciotomy is required.\r"

Other fractures involving the roof of the ankle joint may be called \"pilon fractures,\" but have a better prognosis because the compressive force is coupled with torsional forces. Operative reduction with the application of stable fixation in a clinically proven sequence of steps may lead to a satisfactory outcome in approximately three fourths of the cases, but must be accomplished with a sound understanding of the anatomy of the ankle joint and the principles of stable internal fixation by a surgeon with good atraumatic technique.\r"

The direct slide test was 90 percent sensitive and 95 percent specific overall, with positive and negative predictive values of 74 percent and 98 percent, respectively. Prevalence by culture was 13 percent. Six of our 23 positive slide tests could not be confirmed by culture. A positive chlamydia culture was significantly associated with nonwhite race, a positive Gram's stain, and the presence of mucopurulent endocervical discharge, but not with oral contraceptive pill use, obstetrical history, Pap smear results, multiple sexual partners, coexisting vaginitis or gonorrhea, or a history of prior sexually transmitted diseases.

Despite similar degrees of natriuresis, patients who had undergone renal transplantation demonstrated a clear defect in urine potassium excretion. This defect in potassium excretion was not related to altered responsiveness of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis because plasma renin activity increased in a normal fashion after furosemide in both control and transplant subjects. Although the plasma aldosterone response to increases in plasma renin activity was sluggish in patients undergoing renal transplantation, normal increases in plasma aldosterone levels were achieved in both groups, suggesting that there may be an intrinsic defect in distal tubular potassium secretion that can be unmasked by furosemide.\r"

Therapeutic efficacy was monitored at regular outpatient visits: average supine and erect blood pressures were, respectively, 175/99 and 176/103 mm Hg with placebo, 160/91 and 164/96 mm Hg with single drug treatment, and 152/84 and 152/89 mm Hg with combination therapy. This significant and clinically useful reduction in blood pressure had an overall magnitude of approximately 28/18 mm Hg (supine) and 29/19 mm Hg (erect). Further measurements were made during a series of intensive study days, and the most important additional finding was a pharmacokinetic interaction that resulted in increased peak concentrations and bioavailability of prazosin. In conclusion, the combination of prazosin and verapamil proved effective in the treatment of 12 patients with essential hypertension who had been poorly responsive to conventional treatment with a beta-blocker and thiazide diuretic.\r"

  ".W": "Research investigating the pathogenesis of schizophrenia has demonstrated that cellular immune reactions, such as those that occur in known autoimmune diseases, may participate in producing alterations of the central nervous system. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies of immune-mediated diseases have suggested that activation of the central nervous system by stressful stimuli may be capable of influencing the function of the immune system. In support of that interaction, research using animal models of stress has provided valuable information as to the effect of stress on basic immune function and susceptibility to infectious disease. Possible hormonal and direct mechanisms of the central nervous system-immune system interaction have been proposed.\r"

  ".W": "The human immune deficiency virus (HIV) is not only capable of inducing a state of immunodeficiency, but it is also associated with a state of profound immune dysregulation. This immune dysregulation may manifest itself as autoimmune reactivity that may participate in the overall pathogenic process of HIV infection as well as in the development of a variety of autoimmune laboratory phenomena and clinical syndromes. If autoimmune mechanisms are operative in the immunopathogenesis of the virus itself in the form of autocytotoxicity, the knowledge of this is critically important for the development of effective forms of antiviral therapy. The recognition that individuals infected with HIV can develop a wide variety of autoimmune laboratory phenomena including hypergammaglobulinemia circulating immune complexes and autoantibodies is important to assist in the proper interpretation of tests. The development of clinical autoimmune syndromes in HIV-infected individuals, such as connective tissue disorders, immune cytopenias, and other conditions, is important to the clinician, who must recognize these alternative forms of disease presentation for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Autoimmune-type chronic active hepatitis (AI-CAH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are the two main autoimmune liver diseases. Although the etiologic agents of autoimmune liver diseases are unknown, a loss of tolerance against self antigens is regarded to be responsible for target cell destruction, that is, hepatocytes in AI-CAH and bile duct epithelia in PBC. AI-CAH is heterogeneous, and at least three different subgroups of AI-CAH can be distinguished by circulating autoantibodies including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), liver membrane autoantibodies (LMA), liver kidney microsomal antibodies (LKM), and antibodies to a soluble liver antigen (SLA). This has clinical relevance, because only autoimmune-type CAH seems to profit from immunosuppressive therapy. These serologic diagnostic markers may help to distinguish AI-CAH from CAH due to non-A, non-B virus infection. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and their PBC-specific subtypes characterize PBC, a chronic progressive cholestatic liver disease. Despite numerous therapeutic trials in the past, an effective medical treatment is not available. However, good results have been observed with orthotopic liver transplantation in end-stage PBC. This article has characterized autoimmune liver diseases, dealing with clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic aspects and concentrating on immune phenomena leading to their diagnosis. This has therapeutic consequences.\r"

Because its pathogenesis is unknown, these immunologic alterations have been investigated with an eye toward unraveling the complex mechanism of injury in the bowels of these patients. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that IBD is related to immunologic events. The histopathology of active disease resembles the Arthus reaction, whereas the presence of antiepithelial cell antibodies is reminiscent of Goodpasture's disease. Antibodies against many microorganisms and autoantibodies to mucosal components are commonly found in these patients. Further, there is a marked increase in plasma cells in the lamina propria of patients with active IBD. It is important to keep these findings in perspective. No studies to date have been able to determine whether the features are entirely primary events, that is, related to the initial damage to the intestinal mucosa. If the surface mucosa is injured by an as-yet-unidentified agent, the immunologic findings in IBD may be secondary events. Nonetheless, the similarity in histopathology of the experimental immunologic models of IBD to the human disease encourages investigators to pursue the etiology of this complex disease.\r"

We found that antigen-excess complexes promote IgM anti-DNA synthesis, whereas antibody-excess complexes favor a switch to IgG anti-DNA production. We suggest that interaction of T cells with immune complexes is an important feedback mechanism in control of the immune response.\r"

Studies in experimental animals have shown that primary immune responses to foreign antigens can be induced within the middle and inner ear as indicated by (1) infiltration and local persistence of mononuclear leukocytes and plasma cells, (2) appearance of antibody in perilymph, and (3) eventual development of systemic immunity. Protective effects of inner ear immunization against subsequent viral challenge have also been shown. Clinically, otologic disease can occur in association with a wide variety of systemic autoimmune and immunologic disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Behcet's disease, Sjogren's syndrome, relapsing polychondritis, ulcerative colitis, Cogan's syndrome, and vasculitis-related disease. Evidence for immunologic involvement has also been found in cases of idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss frequently accompanied by vestibular-dysfunction (Meniere's disease). Many of these cases progress into systemic autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune-associated hearing loss has been recognized as one of the few types of treatable hearing dysfunction, with good responses to immunosuppressive therapy. The pathogenesis of autoimmune-related otologic disease has not been established; however, evidence suggests three possible types of immunologic injury: (1) autoantibody binding to type II collagen or other otologic components (type II immunologic injury); (2) immune complex formation leading to vasculitis (type III); and (3) T cell-mediated autoreactivity to inner ear membranous elements (type IV). These mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive. Clinical laboratory procedures should be directed at evaluating these possibilities to assist in diagnosis.\r"

A principal area of this reduction of Ab expression concerns the autoAbs in autoimmune diseases. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests a role for anti-Ids in suppressing autoAb production and an inverse relationship between serum levels of anti-Ids and autoimmune disease activity.\r"

  ".W": "There have been several recent advances in our understanding of aortic stenosis and in its diagnosis and treatment. Aortic stenosis is now most commonly due to a bicuspid valve. Rheumatic aortic stenosis has become much less common and calcific stenosis of valves in the elderly is a rapidly increasing cause. The prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis can be largely determined by their symptoms, with a mean length of survival of 3 to 5 years for patients with angina, 3 years for patients with syncope, and only 12 to 24 months for patients with heart failure. Virtually all symptomatic patients should be operated on, even those with reduced left ventricular function. The risk of sudden death in asymptomatic adults is low, and thus surgery is generally not needed in these cases. Recently, the noninvasive diagnosis of aortic stenosis has improved dramatically with the advent of two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography. These techniques provide information on the pressure gradient and can even allow accurate estimates of valve area. Cardiac catheterization is still required, however, to determine the anatomy of the coronary arteries prior to surgery since many patients will have concomitant coronary artery disease. The newest development in the treatment of aortic stenosis is catheter balloon valvuloplasty, which is relatively safe and has shown early promise in reducing the pressure gradient across not increased to the normal range and is significantly less than that following aortic valve replacement. The long-term results of balloon valvuloplasty are still being evaluated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Based on our controlled study, guidelines for diagnosis are provided in Table 5. Successful management of an FMS patient is often challenging, but frequently gratifying if approached with a positive and caring attitude. The most important aspects of management are a firm diagnosis, reassurance regarding the benign nature of the condition, help in changing patient behavior in order to accept pain and increase functional activities and exercise tolerance, and the use of tricyclic agents. Overall, management of fibromyalgia is an art that requires the combined ingredients of patience, understanding, and firmness in helping patients to assume responsibility for their pain management through behavior modifications.\r"

Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic with potent bactericidal activity against a wide variety of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria. In contrast to the structurally related vancomycin, teicoplanin has a prolonged elimination half-life of approximately 60 hours and it may be safely administered by the intramuscular route. Adverse effects of teicoplanin include ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, skin rash, eosinophilia, neutropenia, and transient elevation of serum aminotransferases. Teicoplanin may be beneficial as an alternative to vancomycin for patients with poor vascular access and in those requiring long-term outpatient therapy. The role of teicoplanin in the treatment and prophylaxis of gram-positive infections will ultimately depend on its unfolding safety and efficacy profile.\r"

Hypertensive crisis following ingestion of foods containing tyramine is the most feared problem associated with MAOI therapy. The authors conclude that only four tyramine-containing foods clearly warrant absolute prohibition, but indicate situations where moderation should apply. Although MAOI remain second-line agents in the treatment of endogenous depression, it is unclear whether MAOI or tricyclic antidepressants should be the drugs of choice in atypical depression and this question necessitates future research.\r"

Saline-drinking rats treated with DOC had a higher systolic blood pressure (210 +/- 4 mm Hg) than did rats without DOC treatment drinking water (138 +/- 3 mm Hg) or saline (141 +/- 3 mm Hg). The concentration of kinins in the inferior vena cava plasma of DOC-salt hypertensive rats did not differ from the venous plasma kinin concentration in normotensive rats drinking water or saline. In contrast, the arterial plasma kinin concentration in DOC-salt hypertensive rats (7.0 +/- 0.8 pg/ml) was lower (p less than 0.002) than that in water-drinking controls (14.0 +/- 2.2 pg/ml); it also was lower (p less than 0.005) in saline-drinking rats (8.1 +/- 0.9 pg/ml) than in water-drinking controls. Infusion of bradykinin (20 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) increased arterial plasma kinins in all the groups. Nonetheless, the arterial plasma kinin concentration achieved during bradykinin infusion in DOC-salt hypertensive (1590 +/- 130 pg/ml) and in saline-drinking rats (1540 +/- 100 pg/ml) was lower than that in water-drinking rats (2140 +/- 210 pg/ml). On the other hand, during infusion of the kininase II inhibitor captopril (80 micrograms/hr i.p.) for 3 days, neither DOC-salt hypertensive rats nor saline-drinking normotensive rats exhibited significant reduction of arterial plasma kinins relative to the level in water-drinking controls. These data indicate that high salt intake, irrespective of the level of blood pressure, causes the arterial plasma concentration of kinins to fall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma renin activity (PRA) and Ang II were also measured before and 60 minutes after furosemide administration. Urinary PGE2 excretion, PRA, and Ang II increased after furosemide administration without captopril pretreatment, and there was a significant correlation between the increment in Ang II and that in urinary PGE2 excretion. Urinary PGE2 excretion and Ang II did not increase after furosemide administration with captopril pretreatment. Urine volume and urinary excretion of sodium and furosemide were not influenced by captopril pretreatment. These results suggest that Ang II may play an important role in furosemide-stimulated PGE2 production.\r"

Patients in a critical care environment often have difficulty communicating their pain, and their pain may be aggravated by fear and anxiety. Indeed, their response to pain may compromise recovery. Although the significance of pain has been cited in literature, there is a dearth of research regarding pain in the critically ill. Such future research, as well as practice interventions, should be based on an understanding of pain psychophysiology. This article presents an in-depth review of pain mechanisms, including a discussion of pain modulation by the endogenous opioid system. Also reviewed are various pain theories contributing to our knowledge of pain. Finally, methods of pain measurement and treatment are outlined, and their appropriateness to critical care is evaluated. Although knowledge about pain mechanisms, measurement, and therapies has expanded, many issues remain unexplained. This article poses questions regarding pain in critically ill patients and presents specific areas for future nursing research.\r"

The relaxation effect was elicited by having the patient contract and relax specific muscle groups in a progressive manner, to experience the difference between the states. Ear oximetry served as physiologic feedback as well as a safety feature in the event of oxygen desaturation during exercise. During and after the exercises he felt secure breathing without the ventilator as measured by the physiologic parameters: heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation determined by oximetry.\r"

Pigs were intubated with endobronchial tubes, permitting deposition of an aerosol of 99mTc-DTPA only into the left lung. Scintillation detectors recorded radioactivity separately from one thigh and from the lung and chest wall on the left and right side. 99mTc-DTPA was given intravenously after 30 min, so that the chest counts from the left lung could be corrected for background activity in either the right lung or the thigh. The uncorrected clearance half time (t1/2) mean +/- SE from the left chest was 118.5 +/- 14.4 min. When corrected for background activity in the right chest, the t1/2 was 82.1 +/- 10.5 min, and when corrected for background activity in the thigh, the t1/2 was 80.9 +/- 10.6 min. There was no significant difference between t1/2 corrected by the measurements from the right chest or the thigh, and in four of five animals the corrected t1/2 by either method was significantly different from the uncorrected t1/2 (P less than 0.05). There was no correlation between the uncorrected t1/2 and the magnitude of the required correction. We conclude that correction for intravascular and tissue accumulation of tracer is an important refinement of the technique and can easily be accomplished by measuring accumulation of tracer in the thigh.\r"

To further investigate this phenomenon we performed a compartmental analysis of the 2-h clearance of DTPA from the lungs of anesthetized sheep using a new method to more accurately correct for the effects of DTPA recirculation. This analysis showed that the DTPA clearance in eight sheep ventilated with zero end-expired pressure was best described by a one-compartment model with a clearance rate of 0.42 +/- 0.15%/min. Ventilating eight sheep with an end-expired pressure of 10 cmH2O throughout the study increased the end-expired volume 0.4 +/- 0.1 liter BTPS and created a clearance curve that was best described by a two-compartment model. In these sheep 56 +/- 16% of the DTPA cleared from the lungs at a rate of 7.9 +/- 2.9%/min. The remainder cleared at a rate similar to that measured in the sheep ventilated with zero end-expired pressure (0.35 +/- 0.18%/min). Additional control and lung inflation experiments were performed using 99mTc-labeled human serum albumin (mol wt = 66,000, radius = 3.6 nm). In six control sheep ventilated with zero end-expired pressure the albumin clearance was best described by a one-compartment model with a clearance rate of 0.06 +/- 0.02%/min. The clearance rate in six sheep with increased lung volume was slightly larger (0.09 +/- 0.02, P less than 0.05) but was well described by a one-compartment model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We developed a synthetic smoke composed of carbon particles (mean diameter of 4.3 microns) to which toxins known to be in smoke, such as HCl or acrolein, could be added one at a time. We delivered synthetic smoke to dogs for 10 min and monitored extravascular lung water (EVLW) accumulation thereafter with a double-indicator thermodilution technique. Final EVLW correlated highly with gravimetric values (r = 0.93, P less than 0.01). HCl in concentrations of 0.1-6 N when added to heated carbon (120 degrees C) and cooled to 39 degrees C produced airway damage but no pulmonary edema. Acrolein, in contrast, produced airway damage but also pulmonary edema, whereas capillary wedge pressures remained stable. Low-dose acrolein smoke (less than 200 ppm) produced edema in two of five animals with a 2- to 4-h delay. Intermediate-dose acrolein smoke (200-300 ppm) always produced edema at an average of 147 +/- 57 min after smoke, whereas high-dose acrolein (greater than 300 ppm) produced edema at 65 +/- 16 min after smoke. Thus acrolein but not HCl, when presented as a synthetic smoke, produced a delayed-onset, noncardiogenic, and peribronchiolar edema in a roughly dose-dependent fashion.\r"

Either 0.09 ml/kg OA or an equivalent volume of 0.9% NaCl (controls) was administered intravenously to 48 anesthetized, paralyzed dogs. Each animal received one aerosolized solute either 60 min after (protocol A) or 30 min before (protocol B) the infusion of OA or NaCl. In protocol A clearances of all three solutes were similar in OA and control animals. In contrast, in protocol B clearances of all three solutes increased significantly during OA infusion; during the next 60 min clearances of 99mTc-DTPA and 67Ga-DFOM returned to control values but 111In-TF remained increased. We conclude that 1) in OA-induced permeability edema pulmonary clearance of aerosolized solutes is increased when the aerosol is delivered 30 min before but not 60 min after injury, and 2) increased clearance persists only for large molecules, presumably because smaller molecules cross injured epithelium quickly and completely. These phenomena are best explained by a nonhomogeneous distribution of OA-induced injury.\r"

However, the results in the literature obtained by extrapolation techniques are inconsistent. To overcome problems of the extrapolation approach, transport functions of the pulmonary circulation (including the left heart) were computed by deconvolution of pulmonary arterial and aortic pairs of thermodilution curves after central venous indicator injection (10 ml of an ice-cold blood indocyanine green dye mixture). Thermal recovery was determined as the finite integral of the transport function. Thirteen mongrel dogs under piritramid-N2O anesthesia were examined under base-line conditions, in orthostasis to alter the distribution of pulmonary blood flow (9 dogs), and in oleic acid edema (8 dogs). Using the deconvolution approach, thermal recovery was 0.97 +/- 0.04 under base-line conditions, 0.96 +/- 0.03 in orthostasis, and 0.96 +/- 0.05 in pulmonary edema. Thermal recovery determined from extrapolated dilution curves was greater than 100% in all groups, a physically impossible finding. It is concluded that thermal recovery is incomplete but insensitive with respect to the distribution of blood flow and to the size of the extravascular compartment. Monoexponential extrapolation is unsuited for the determination of thermal recovery.\r"

Immediately postdelivery of histamine aerosol (7.5 mg histamine base) mean sRL increased by 223% (P less than 0.05), and mean Vtr decreased by 25% (P less than 0.05). The duration of the changes was similar, with a return to base-line values within 60 min. With increasing doses of histamine up to 30 mg, there was a corresponding increase in mean sRL, whereas the maximum effect on Vtr was already reached after 7.5 mg of histamine. Atropine (0.2 mg/kg iv) increased mean Vtr by 77% (P less than 0.05) and blunted the histamine effects on sRL, whereas the histamine effects on Vtr were abolished. Intravenous histamine or carbachol aerosol had similar effects on sRL and Vtr. We conclude that in conscious sheep 1) histamine produces both tracheal and bronchial constriction with a similar time course, 2) there is a base-line vagal tone in the trachea and not the bronchi, 3) the cholinergic reflex component of histamine-induced constriction is greater in the trachea than the bronchi, and 4) this difference between the trachea and bronchi is not due to differential aerosol deposition or cholinergic responsiveness.\r"

The small-litter males gained weight at a more rapid rate than the other litter types, both before and after weaning, and attained a final body weight twofold greater than the other groups. The small-litter males had significantly higher (P less than 0.05) numbers of adipocytes per epididymal fat pad than the other litter groups with 60.4, 51.4, and 79.0% greater cell number per pad than control, large, and pair-fed animals, respectively. Limiting food intake to small-litter animals after weaning (pair-fed) inhibited this growth and prevented fat cell proliferation. Litter manipulation had significant effects on male rats, but the same treatment did not influence female rats. Litter size influenced fat cell characteristics but had little effect on the adipocytes' ability to take up or metabolize glucose. The major finding, in terms of insulin responsiveness, was the difference between the sexes. The uptake of tritiated 2-deoxyglucose by the fat cells of female litter groups was significantly higher than that of the males whether insulin was present or not, whereas the conversion of [1-14C]glucose to CO2 by the adipocytes of females was lower than that of the males.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of fibrinogen in the evolution of the increased permeability after oleic acid-induced lung injury was studied in New Zealand White rabbits. Animals depleted of fibrinogen by treatment with Malayan pit viper venom were compared with untreated rabbits immediately and at 1 and 24 h after injury. The increased permeability to albumin and elevated extravascular lung water (EVLW) associated with lung injury returned to control values by 24 h in untreated animals. Fibrinogen-depleted animals had a higher mortality (10/25 vs. 2/17, P less than 0.02) and showed a greater immediate increase in permeability to albumin that returned to control values at 1 and 24 h after injury, as well as trends toward elevated blood-free dry lung weight and larger increases in EVLW that persisted for 24 h. These findings indicate that fibrinogen-related proteins play an important role in controlling the microvascular injury that is produced by oleic acid. However, when these proteins are depleted, other mechanisms partially control the leak at later stages of the repair process.\r"

  ".W": "High concentrations of oxygen damage the lung and increase bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid levels of leukotrienes. We sought to identify the specific leukotrienes produced and their relationship to the severity of the lung damage and the inflammatory cell populations by exposing mice to 100% oxygen for up to 4 days. Leukotrienes were not detected in BAL fluid from air-exposed mice. Leukotriene D4 (LTD4) was found after 2 days of exposure to 100% oxygen, increased with longer periods of exposure, and then decreased while LTE4 appeared when the lung damage became severe. LTB4 and LTC4 were not found at any time. Neutropenic mice had identical results, indicating that neutrophils were not the source of the leukotrienes. To determine why LTC4 was not found and why LTD4 decreased and LTE4 increased on day 4, we measured the metabolic capacity of BAL supernatant for leukotrienes. Incubation of LTD4 in BAL supernatant from air-exposed mice resulted in the conversion of LTD4 to LTE4, which was blocked by L-cysteine, a dipeptidase inhibitor. Faster conversion occurred after exposure to 100% oxygen for 3 and 4 days. The rate of bioconversion correlated with the BAL protein concentration (r = 0.756, P less than 0.001), and it was similar in neutropenic and nonneutropenic mice. Little LTC4 and no LTE4 were converted in BAL supernatant from air- or oxygen-exposed mice. The early and progressive increase in LTD4 suggests that sulfidopeptide leukotrienes may play a role in the pathogenesis of hyperoxic lung damage. The increased dipeptidase activity during hyperoxic exposure may serve a protective role by converting the more potent LTD4 to the less potent LTE4.\r"

Concentrations of hormones and metabolites involved in glucoregulation were measured. Metabolic rate and substrate utilization were studied by indirect calorimetry. Studies were performed without prior exercise, as well as 2 and 48 h after 60 min of bicycle exercise at 150 W. We found 1) a progressive increase in insulin concentrations reaching 1,092 +/- 135 microU/ml with increasing glucose levels, 2) linear relationships between glucose concentrations and concentrations of C-peptide (r = 0.931 +/- 0.008) and proinsulin (r = 0.952 +/- 0.009),3) increased glucose oxidation with increasing glucose uptake, 4) increased plasma norepinephrine, O2 uptake, and beta-hydroxybutyrate at greater than or equal to 20 mM glucose, and 5) no change in beta-cell response or glucose-induced thermogenesis after one bout of exercise despite no compensating changes in plasma concentrations of hormones or metabolites. We conclude that the beta-cell has a very large secretory potential. Secretion of the beta-cell increases linearly with prolonged, graded hyperglycemia. The processing of proinsulin is unchanged during prolonged beta-cell stimulation. In addition, hyperglycemia and sympathetic nervous activity induced by hyperinsulinemia enhance metabolic rate and ketone body production. Finally, a single bout of exercise does not influence either the beta-cell response to intravenous glucose or glucose-induced thermogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular itinerary and processing of insulin and proinsulin were studied to elucidate possible mechanisms for the observed in vivo differences in the biologic half-lives of these two hormones. A rat fibroblast cell line transfected with a normal human insulin receptor gene was used. Due to gene amplification, the cells express large numbers of receptors and are ideal for studying a ligand, such as proinsulin, that has a low affinity for the insulin receptor. Competitive binding at 4 degrees C showed that the concentration of unlabeled insulin and proinsulin that is needed to displace 50% of tracer insulin or proinsulin was 0.85-0.95 nM and 140-150 nM, respectively. Binding to surface receptors and internalization occur at rates that are four to five times faster in cells incubated with insulin compared with proinsulin. Chloroquine led to an increase in cell-associated radioactivity of approximately 1.4-fold in cells incubated with insulin or proinsulin, but inhibited the appearance of degraded insulin by 54% and degraded proinsulin by only 10%. To study the fate of internalized ligand, cells were incubated with insulin and proinsulin until steady state binding occurred. Surface bound ligand was removed by an acid wash and the remaining cell-associated radioactivity represented internalized ligand. Cells were then reincubated in 37 degrees C buffer and the cell-associated radioactivity and radioactivity released into the medium were analyzed by TCA precipitation, Sephadex G-50, and HPLC. The results demonstrated that proinsulin more readily bypasses the intracellular degradative machinery and is therefore released intact from the cell via the retroendocytotic pathway. These results may help to explain the prolonged metabolic clearance rate and biologic responsiveness of proinsulin in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "During sepsis or after injection of endotoxin into rats, there is a large increase in muscle protein breakdown and prostaglandin E2 (PEG2) production. Prior studies showed that partially purified interleukin 1 (IL-1) from human monocytes can stimulate these processes when added to isolated rat muscles. The availability of pure recombinant IL-1 and other monokines has allowed us to investigate the identity of the active agent in this process. Incubation of muscles with recombinant human or murine IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta or with IL-1 plus a phorbol ester did not stimulate muscle proteolysis or PGE2 production. Homogeneous natural porcine IL-1 (\"catabolin\") and mouse or human IL-1 beta were also not effective in vitro. In addition, a variety of other human cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (\"cachectin\"), epidermal thymocyte-activating factor, eosinophil cytotoxicity-enhancing factor, interferon-alpha, beta, and gamma, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta, which are all released by activated macrophages, TGF-alpha, or mixtures of these polypeptides, also failed to activate proteolysis or PGE2 production. By contrast, a large increase in net protein breakdown could be induced in the rat soleus by polypeptides released from porcine monocytes or by the serum from febrile cattle which had been injected with Pasteurella haemolytica or bovine rhinotracheitis virus. Therefore, a still-unidentified product of activated monocytes appears to be responsible for the negative nitrogen balance that accompanies infectious illness.\r"

These cells expressed normal quantities of surface CD3 and CD2 but low levels of CD7, were CD8+ and CD4-, and CD16-. In order to determine whether cells of this phenotype were functional, six CD5- cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones isolated from normal individuals were studied. The CD5- CTL clones all demonstrated normal cytolytic activity against appropriate target cells. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against CD3, CD8, CD2, and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3, but not against CD5, inhibited cytolytic activity. Changes in intracellular calcium [( Ca2+]i) in response to anti-CD5 and anti-CD3 MAbs were measured. Stimulation by anti-CD5 MAb alone did not give rise to a change in [Ca2+]i. However, under conditions of limiting concentrations of anti-CD3 MAb, preincubation of normal CD5+, but not CD5-, clones with anti-CD5 MAb led to a dramatic enhancement in the ability of anti-CD3 MAb to elicit a rise in [Ca2+]i. We conclude that CD5- T lymphocytes represent a normal lymphoid phenotype. Although CD5 may be involved in T cell activation when present, these CD5- CTL clones appear to express normal cytolytic activity.\r"

Male CD rats underwent a 60% pancreatectomy (Px); controls were sham operated. 1 wk later, either 10% sucrose (SUC) was substituted as fluid supply or tap water was continued (WAT). Plasma glucose and insulin values in Px-WAT remained equal to the sham groups; in Px-SUC the values were euglycemic for 25 d, but then nonfasting plasma glucose rose 15 mg/dl. After 6 wk, B cell mass in Px-WAT was reduced by 45% and non-B cell mass by 57%. In contrast, in Px-SUC both masses were comparable to the sham groups. The insulin response to 27.7 mM glucose was measured using the in vitro perfused pancreas. The responses were reduced in Px-WAT but in proportion to their reduced B cell mass; in contrast, it was 75% less than expected in Px-SUC. Also, the response to arginine given at 16.7 mM glucose was reduced only in Px-SUC. These results show that a lowering of B cell mass that does not result in hyperglycemia has no adverse effect on the remaining B cells. On the other hand, if even mild hyperglycemia develops, B cell function becomes impaired and results in inappropriately reduced insulin stores and insulin responses to marked stimuli.\r"

However, little is known about monocyte-mediated signals leading to CSF-secretion by T lymphocytes, although soluble monocyte products have been implicated. We have employed monoclonal antibody anti-T3B covalently coupled to CnBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads, to show that multimeric ligation of T cell antigen receptor leads to T cell receptiveness to interleukin 1 (IL-1), as indicated by T cell production of CSF, which induces growth of myeloid progenitor cells into neutrophil, eosinophil, and monocyte colonies. To investigate the molecular basis of these findings, total RNA was extracted from T3B Sepharose-primed and IL-1-stimulated T lymphocytes and probed for granulocyte-monocyte-CSF (GM-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF), and monocyte-CSF (M-CSF) mRNA. GM-CSF, but not G-CSF or M-CSF, messages were detected. Nuclear \"run on\" assays revealed that IL-1 action is effective primarily at the level of GM-CSF gene transcription. These results suggest a previously unrecognized role of IL-1 in the regulation of GM-CSF secretion by T cells.\r"

Protein S circulates in both an active, free form and in an inactive complex with C4b-binding protein. To elucidate the role of protein S in disease states and during oral anticoagulation, we developed a functional assay for protein S that permits evaluation of the distribution of protein S between free and bound forms and permits determination of the specific activity of the free protein S. In liver disease, free protein S antigen is moderately reduced and the free protein S has significantly reduced specific activity. In disseminated intravascular coagulation, reduced protein S activity occurs due to a redistribution of protein S to the inactive bound form. During warfarin anticoagulation, reduction of free protein S antigen and the appearance of forms with abnormal electrophoretic mobility significantly decrease protein S activity. After the initiation of warfarin, the apparent half-life of protein S is 42.5 h. In patients with thromboembolic disease, transient protein S deficiency occurs due to redistribution to the complexed form. Caution should be exercised in diagnosing protein S deficiency in such patients by use of functional assays.\r"

Hepatic vein and biliary multiple indicator dilution curves were obtained after injection of indicators into either vessel. The main difference in hepatic venous dilution curves was a 3.1-fold longer t0 (time spent in nonexchanging vessels) and a 5% larger equivalent water space after injection into the hepatic artery. Biliary tracer recovery of water was markedly higher after arterial injection than after portal vein injection. Both taurocholate and taurodehydrocholate stimulated bile flow and increased biliary tracer recovery after injection into either vessel. The biliary recovery of sucrose relative to that of water, which is a measure of biliary sucrose permeation, was much lower when given into the hepatic artery than when given into the portal vein. During taurocholate infusion, it decreased by 33% in the hepatic artery but increased 36% in the portal vein. Taurodehydrocholate, by contrast, did not affect permeation of sucrose given into the portal vein. Our studies demonstrate marked exchange of tracer water in the biliary epithelium. Taurocholate, but not taurodehydrocholate, increases permeation of sucrose into bile in the portal vein bed while both bile salts decrease it in the arterial bed.\r"

  ".U": "88213697\r", 
  ".W": "Alterations in thyroid hormone status and the administration of radiographic contrast agents can markedly influence iodothyronine metabolism and, in particular, the activity of type I 5'-deiodinase (5'DI). In the present studies, the mechanisms responsible for these effects have been reassessed. As previously reported, the addition of iopanoic acid (IOP) to broken cell preparations resulted in a competitive pattern of 5'DI inhibition. However, the in vivo administration to rats of IOP or 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) resulted in a noncompetitive pattern of inhibition of 5'DI in the liver, kidney, and thyroid gland, whereby marked decreases in maximal enzyme velocity (V max) were noted, with no change in the value of the Michaelis-Menten constant. In rats rendered hyperthyroid by the injection of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), 5'DI activity was significantly increased in the liver and the kidney. The administration of IOP to these thyrotoxic animals resulted in a rapid loss of enzyme activity characterized by an approximate 80% decrease in 5'DI V max values in both tissues. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect persisted for longer than 60 h after a single IOP injection. IOP administration also decreased 5'DI V max levels in the thyroid gland by 52%. In other experiments, treatment of intact Reuber FAO hepatoma cells with IOP or rT3 induced a rapid decrease in 5'DI V max levels. In cells treated with cycloheximide, these agents enhanced the rate of disappearance of enzyme activity by greater than 12-fold, indicating a predominant effect on accelerating the rate of enzyme inactivation and/or degradation. These studies demonstrate that iodothyronines and other iodinated compounds have complex regulatory effects on 5'DI that entail alterations in the rates of both enzyme activation and inactivation. The previously accepted concept that rT3 and IOP impair thyroxine (T4) to T3 conversion in vivo by acting as competitive inhibitors is an oversimplification. Rather, the clinically beneficial effects of administering these agents to patients with hyperthyroidism may result primarily from the rapid and prolonged inactivation of 5'DI which occurs in the thyroid gland and peripheral tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have established the existence of substrate cycles in humans, but factors regulating the rate of cycling have not been identified. We have therefore investigated the acute response of glucose/glucose-6P-glucose (glucose) and triglyceride/fatty acid (TG/FA) substrate cycling to the infusion of epinephrine (0.03 microgram/kg.min) and glucagon. The response to a high dose glucagon infusion (2 micrograms/kg.min) was tested, as well as the response to a low dose infusion (5 ng/kg.min), with and without the simultaneous infusion of somatostatin (0.1 microgram/kg.min) and insulin (0.1 mU/kg.min). Additionally, the response to chronic prednisone (50 mg/d) was evaluated, both alone and during glucagon (low dose) and epinephrine infusion. Finally, the response to hyperglycemia, with insulin and glucagon held constant by somatostatin infusion and constant replacement of glucagon and insulin at basal rates, was investigated. Glucose cycling was calculated as the difference between the rate of appearance (Ra) of glucose as determined using 2-d1- and 6,6-d2-glucose as tracers. TG/FA cycling was calculated by first determining the Ra glycerol with d5-glycerol and the Ra FFA with [1-13C]palmitate, then subtracting Ra FFA from three times Ra glycerol. The results indicate that glucagon stimulates glucose cycling, and this stimulatory effect is augmented when the insulin response to glucagon infusion is blocked. Glucagon had minimal effect on TG/FA cycling. In contrast, epinephrine stimulated TG/FA cycling, but affected glucose cycling minimally. Prednisone had no direct effect on either glucose or TG/FA cycling, but blunted the stimulatory effect of glucagon on glucose cycling. Hyperglycemia, per se, had no direct effect on glucose or TG/FA cycling. Calculations revealed that stimulation of TG/FA cycling theoretically amplified the sensitivity of control of fatty acid flux, but no such amplification was evident as a result of the stimulation of glucose cycling by glucagon.\r"

Recent reports that the platelet membrane glycoprotein complex IIb/IIIa is expressed in several cell types prompted us to look for GPIb expression in other vascular cells. Immunoperoxidase staining of human stomach and skin histologic sections with polyclonal as well as monoclonal anti-GPIb antibody revealed the presence of GPIb in the endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell layers. Western blotting using monospecific polyclonal anti-GPIb antibodies confirmed the presence of immunoreactive GPIb in human umbilical vein endothelial and bovine aortic smooth muscle cell cultures. Fab fragments of a monoclonal anti-GPIb antibody were used to immunoprecipitate [3H]leucine labeled GPIb from metabolically labeled cells. The GPIb in these cells was functional as measured by ristocetin-dependent cell agglutination and by vWF binding. Endothelial cells as well as smooth muscle cells bound 125I-labeled vWF in a ristocetin-dependent manner, with a Kd of 7.9 nM.\r"

  ".W": "Transfection of an activated rat oncogene into NIH3T3 fibroblasts leads to transformation and induction of a metastatic phenotype. To identify genes whose activation might mediate these processes, we used a differential screening strategy. A 1.5-kb transcript is induced fiftyfold, constitutes 1% of ras transformed cell messenger RNA (mRNA) and is the most abundantly induced message in these cells. Our sequence data shows that it encodes murine cathepsin L, a potent collagenolytic and elastinolytic lysosomal enzyme. The murine clone was used to isolate human cathepsin L complementary DNA (cDNA) clones. The complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of human and murine preprocathepsin L are presented and compared to other papain family cysteine proteinases. Northern analysis shows that both human and murine cathepsin L probes hybridize to a 1.5-kb transcript in several tissues, but also to a 4-kb transcript in human kidney. These clones will facilitate studies of the structure, expression, and function of cathepsin L, including its unexpected upregulation in transformation.\r"

The method required bone to be chilled to -70 degrees C, sectioned at 10 microns in a special bone cryostat, and these sections to be fixed and embedded for ultrathin sectioning. Good preservation of bone cells was seen. The advantages of this method are that it allows numerous particular regions of the 10 microns thick sections to be selected under normal light microscopy, and these regions to be then selected for electron microscopy. The 10 microns sections allow for excellent penetration of the fixative and thus better preservation of the tissue is more likely.\r"

  ".U": "88213916\r", 
  ".W": "The recent establishment of a firm therapeutic role for reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction has stimulated interest in the development of more ideal thrombolytic agents. Anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) is a new plasminogen activator possessing properties that are promising for intravenous thrombolytic application in acute myocardial infarction. To assess the reperfusion potential of intravenous APSAC, a multi-center, angiographically controlled reperfusion trial was performed. An approved thrombolytic regimen of intracoronary streptokinase served as a control. Consenting patients with clinical and electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction were studied angiographically and 240 qualifying patients with documented coronary occlusion (flow grade 0 or 1) were randomized to treatment in less than 6 h of symptom onset (mean 3.4 h, range 0.4 to 6.0) with either intravenous APSAC (30 U in 2 to 4 min) or intracoronary streptokinase (160,000 U over 60 min). Both groups also received heparin for greater than or equal to 24 h. Reperfusion was evaluated angiographically over 90 min and success was defined as advancement of grade 0 or 1 to grade 2 or 3 flow. Rates of reperfusion for the two treatment regimens were 51% (59 of 115) at 90 min after intravenous APSAC and 60% (67 of 111) after 60 min of intracoronary streptokinase (p less than or equal to 0.18). Reperfusion at any time within the 90 min was observed in 55 and 64%, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.16). Time to reperfusion occurred at 43 +/- 23 min after intravenous and 31 +/- 17 min after intracoronary therapy. The success of intravenous therapy was dependent on the time to treatment: 60% of APSAC patients treated within 4 h exhibited reperfusion compared with 33% of those treated after 4 h (p less than or equal to 0.01). Reperfusion rates were also dependent on initial flow grade (p less than or equal to 0.0001): 48% (81 of 168) for grade 0 (APSAC = 43%, streptokinase = 54%), but 78% for grade 1 (APSAC = 78%, streptokinase = 77%). APSAC given as a rapid injection was generally well tolerated, although the median change in blood pressure at 2 to 4 min was greater after APSAC than after streptokinase (-10 versus -5 mm Hg). Mean plasma fibrogen levels fell more at 90 min after the sixfold higher dose of APSAC than after streptokinase (to 32 versus 64% of control). Reported bleeding events were more frequent after APSAC but occurred primarily at the site of catheter insertion and no event was intracranial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"
