  ".W": "Dietary phosphate restriction produces a rapid increase in tubular reabsorption of phosphate. To evaluate whether insulin is important in the acute renal adaptation following a low phosphate meal, four groups of conscious rats were studied by renal clearance methods, following a single meal by gavage. Group A received a normal (0.8%) phosphate meal, followed by saline infusion; Group B, a low (0.03%) phosphate meal, followed by saline infusion; Group C, a low phosphate meal, followed by infusion of somatostatin to suppress endogenous insulin secretion; and Group D, a low phosphate meal, followed by infusion of somatostatin plus insulin. Baseline plasma phosphate, insulin, glomerular filtration rate, and fractional excretion of phosphate were similar in all four groups. Following a low phosphate meal in Groups B, C, and D, there was a decrease in plasma phosphate, as compared with Group A. Whereas fractional excretion of phosphate decreased when plasma phosphate fell in Group B, administration of somatostatin (Group C) prevented the drop in fractional excretion of phosphate, despite a lower plasma phosphate. The addition of exogenous insulin (Group D) restored the antiphosphaturic effect of the low phosphate meal. These results suggest that insulin contributes to the acute decrease in phosphate excretion following a low phosphate meal.\r"

  ".W": "Two antibody probes were used to characterize the putative renal antigens of HgCl2-induced antiglomerular basement membrane renal disease in Brown Norway (BN) rat. The first probe was the linear immunofluorescence imparting, in vivo bound, nephritogenic antiglomerular-basement-membrane autoantibody (anti-GBM-Ab). The second probe was a rat monoclonal antibody to the B subunit of laminin that was obtained from fusion of spleen cells of HgCl2 injected BN rat. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the anti-GBM-Ab reacted with laminin, type IV collagen, collagenase-resistant noncollagenous portion of glomerular basement membrane (GBM), saline soluble proteins of kidney cortex homogenate and fibronectin. Western blot analysis of laminin indicated that the reactive epitopes detected by both probes were on the B chain subunit but not the A subunit. In nonreduced collagenase-digested GBM the epitopes were present on 27 kD and 42 to 48 kD polypeptides. A similar pattern was seen on collagenase-digested human GBM. On rat and human GBM the patterns obtained with rat autoantibody and autoantibody from a patient with Goodpasture syndrome were similar, suggesting that some of the in vivo bound anti-GBM autoantibodies in HgCl2-induced disease in rat are directed against epitopes which are similar to the Goodpasture antigen of human. Reactive epitopes were also detected on saline soluble proteins of kidney cortex homogenate with the predominant antigen being a 31 kD polypeptide. In the saline soluble proteins the reactive polypeptides including the major 31 kD polypeptide did not originate from laminin, type IV collagen, or the collagenase-resistant noncollagenous part of GBM. The precise structural origin of soluble proteins was not defined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients showing disease stabilisation or objective response were randomised to stop chemotherapy or to continue until disease progression. At that stage 27% showed partial responses, 3% complete responses, and 10% disease stabilisation. 22 patients were randomised to continue chemotherapy and 21 to stop. There was no difference in time to disease progression, response duration, or survival between the two groups. Toxicity was mild during the first four courses of therapy. Thus, short courses of single-agent chemotherapy can produce similar therapeutic results to long-term chemotherapy, which has major implications for cost, resource allocation, and toxicity of therapy. Stopping chemotherapy early in responders did not cause rapid relapse. Since drug resistance apparently develops early during therapy, new approaches to modify resistance should be more useful than continuous chemotherapy.\r"

At 24 h 81% and 87.5% of arteries were patent respectively (95% CI, 71-91% and 83.5-91.5%). Time to therapy had no significant effect on patency rates. There was one early reocclusion within 24 h in each treatment group and clinical evidence of reocclusion was recorded between 24 h and hospital discharge in a further 5 patients (streptokinase 3, anistreplase 2). With these regimens, therefore, anistreplase and streptokinase gave the same patency rates.\r"

Non-smokers live longer than smokers, but death (when it comes) is more likely to be due to heart attack and less likely to be due to cancer. By contrast a lower level of plasma cholesterol, which is also associated with longer life, is expected to reduce the lifetime risk of fatal heart attack, its place then being taken by a typical mixture of other causes of death.\r"

After injection of actrapid plasma free insulin levels rose slowly, reaching a plateau by 105 min at 222 (19) pmol/l. Injection of the analogue resulted in a rapid early peak at 30 min (798 [112] pmol/l), and levels were significantly higher than those after actrapid between 15 and 210 min.

Ten patients then underwent metabolic studies. One patient had amenorrhoea, but the rest experienced regular withdrawal bleeding which was seldom heavy. Fourteen endometrial biopsy samples were taken during the fifth treatment cycle; none showed proliferative or hyperplastic features. The effects of transdermal norethisterone acetate on symptoms, lipid metabolism, and psychological status were determined by comparing features in the oestrogen-only phase and in the combined phase; the effects were very mild. These preliminary findings show that transdermal progestagen can be successfully administered in hormone replacement therapy to prevent endometrial proliferation while minimising the adverse effects that may be seen with oral administration.\r"

This lesion usually becomes symptomatic before the age of 10 years and is more common than has previously been suspected. It has been found on the left side in 93% of the 28 cases reported in the English literature. Barium swallow during periods of quiescence and nasopharyngoscopy have frequently been successful in identifying the presence of these embryological remnants. Definitive therapy consists of total excision of the sinus tract, which can be facilitated by direct endoscopic placement of a Fogarty catheter into the sinus lumen before surgical exploration. The embryological basis for the occurrence of these sinuses is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A new technique for reembedding celloidin sections of human temporal bones for transmission electron microscopy is described. It consists of four steps: 1. loosening of celloidin sections from glass slides with use of xylene and dissection of the area of interest, 2. removal of celloidin with use of clove oil, 3. staining with 1% osmium tetroxide and 1% tannic acid, and 4. embedding in epoxy resin. Autolytic changes were seen due to poor fixation. TEM of reembedded celloidin sections of optimally fixed tissue revealed that the celloidin-embedding procedure affected ultrastructural preservation to some degree. This included less well-preserved cell membranes and some increased electron density of the cytosol decreasing the EM resolution of intracytoplasmic organelles. The technique allows TEM analysis of the intact labyrinth at all regions in the same specimen without dissection of the fragile tissue components of the membranous labyrinth. This might make the technique useful for processing freshly fixed human inner ear tissue and temporal bones for ultrastructural histopathological analysis.\r"

  ".W": "The recognition of renal cysts in two patients with chronic hypokalemia and the renal effects of hypokalemia in certain species of animals prompted this study of the possible association of hypokalemia and renal cysts in patients with primary aldosteronism or primary renal potassium wasting. Using CT scans, we studied 55 patients with primary aldosteronism, of whom 24 had cysts (44 percent). The cysts were more frequent in patients with adrenal tumors than in those with idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia. Sixteen of the 26 patients with tumors (62 percent) had renal cysts, which were often multiple and located in the medulla. Lower plasma potassium levels and higher serum aldosterone levels, urinary aldosterone excretion, and plasma renin activity were correlated with the extent of the cystic disease. Sequential observations indicated that prolonged hypokalemia can be accompanied by the development of renal scarring and that the size and number of cysts can decrease markedly in some patients after the removal of an adrenal adenoma. The association of hypokalemia, aldosteronism, and renal cysts was also supported by the finding of multiple medullary cysts in two patients with primary renal potassium wasting. We conclude that chronic hypokalemia is accompanied by enhanced renal cytogenesis and may lead to interstitial scarring and renal insufficiency. Renal cysts are thus dynamic structures whose growth can be influenced by hormonal or pharmacologic interventions.\r"

Forty-eight patients (25 in the surgical group and 23 in the radiation group) formed the study group; 6 other patients (11 percent) were excluded from the study because on biopsy their lesions proved to be either second primary tumors or inflammatory or infectious processes. Recurrence at the site of the original metastasis was less frequent in the surgical group than in the radiation group (5 of 25 [20 percent] vs. 12 of 23 [52 percent]; P less than 0.02). The overall length of survival was significantly longer in the surgical group (median, 40 weeks vs. 15 weeks in the radiation group; P less than 0.01), and the patients treated with surgery remained functionally independent longer (median, 38 weeks vs. 8 weeks in the radiation group; P less than 0.005). We conclude that patients with cancer and a single metastasis to the brain who receive treatment with surgical resection plus radiotherapy live longer, have fewer recurrences of cancer in the brain, and have a better quality of life than similar patients treated with radiotherapy alone.\r"

Because the actin-binding protein ABP1p is associated with the cortical cytoskeleton of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it might be involved in the spatial organization of cell surface growth. ABP1p is localized to the cortical cytoskeleton and its overproduction causes assembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton at inappropriate sites on the cell surface, resulting in delocalized surface growth. We have now cloned and sequenced the gene encoding ABP1p. ABP1p is a novel protein with a 50 amino-acid C-terminal domain that is very similar to the SH3 domain in the non-catalytic region of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (including those encoded by the proto-oncogenes c-src and c-abl), in phospholipase C gamma and in alpha-spectrin. We also identified an SH3-related motif in the actin-binding tail domain of myosin-I. The identification of SH3 domains in a family of otherwise unrelated proteins that associate with the membrane cytoskeleton indicates that this domain might serve to bring together signal transduction proteins and their targets or regulators, or both, in the membrane cytoskeleton.\r"

  ".U": "90136924\r", 
  ".W": "In the caudate-putamen the glutamatergic cortical input and the dopaminergic nigrostriatal input have opposite effects on the firing rate of striatal neurons. Although little is known of the biochemical mechanisms underlying this antagonism, one action of dopamine is to stimulate the cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (dopamine and cAMP-regulated phospho-protein, of relative molecular mass 32,000 (32K]. This phosphorylation converts DARPP-32 from an inactive molecule into a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1. Here we show that activation of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) subclass of glutamate receptors reverses the cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 in striatal slices through NMDA-induced dephosphorylation of DARPP-32. Thus, the antagonistic effects of dopamine and glutamate on the excitability of striatal neurons are reflected in antagonistic effects of these neurotransmitters on the state of phosphorylation of DARPP-32. Our results indicate that stimulation of NMDA receptors leads to the activation of a neuronal protein phosphatase, presumably the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, and show, in an intact cell preparation, that signal transduction in the nervous system can be mediated by protein dephosphorylation.\r"

  ".W": "Group II introns, which are classed together on the basis of a conserved secondary structure, are found in organellar genes of lower eukaryotes and plants. Like introns in nuclear pre-messenger RNA, they are excised by a two-step splicing reaction to generate branched circular RNAs, the so-called lariats. A remarkable feature of group II introns is their self-splicing activity in vitro. In the absence of a nucleotide cofactor, the intron RNAs catalyse two successive transesterification reactions which lead to autocatalytic excision of the lariat IVS from pre-mRNA and concomitantly to exon ligation. By virtue of its ability to specifically bind the 5' exon, the intron can also catalyse such reactions on exogenous RNA substrates. This sequence-specific attachment could enable group II introns to integrate into unrelated RNAs by reverse splicing, in a process similar to that described for the self-splicing Tetrahymena group I intron. Here we report that group II lariat IVS can indeed reintegrate itself into an RNA composed of the ligated exons in vitro. This occurs by a process of self-splicing that completely reverses both transesterification steps of the forward reaction: it involves a transition of the 2'-5' phosphodiester bond of the lariat RNA into the 3'-5' bond of the reconstituted 5' splice junction.\r"

The eleven base pairs constituting the autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) of the high-copy-number TRP1ARS1 plasmid of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are located in a linker region near the edge of a positioned nucleosome and form an origin of replication. Could nucleosome positioning render the ARS accessible for interaction with the proteins necessary for its function? I have tested this hypothesis by making deletions and an insertion to move the ARS into the nucleosome DNA and then examining the effects on ARS function. There is a marked decrease in copy number when the ARS is moved into the central DNA region of the nucleosome core particle, a region known to differ in structure and stability from the peripheral segments of nucleosome DNA.\r"

The normal locus was found to be transcribed into two polyadenylated messenger RNA species of 1.8 and 2.7 kilobases. We have isolated a complementary DNA clone from a normal adult human liver cDNA library which has an open reading frame with a coding capacity for a protein of 432 amino acids and relative molecular mass 48,536. The strong homology of the C-terminal half of the protein to the A-type cyclins of clam and Drosophila identifies it as a human cyclin A. The cyclin A gene has several exons, and the HBV integration occurs within an intron. As cyclins are important in the control of cell division, the disruption of a cyclin A gene by viral insertion might contribute to tumorigenesis.\r"

Arginines 162 and 243 reach into the active site from an adjacent subunit and interact with the cooperative substrate fructose 6-phosphate. Mutation of these arginines to serine results in mutant enzymes with reduced substrate binding and lowered cooperativity, but with little change in their catalytic ability (kcat). Arg 72 bridges the two substrates fructose 6-phosphate and ATP, and interacts with the 1-phosphate of the product fructose 1,6-biphosphate. Mutation of this residue to serine reduces the catalytic activity, cooperativity and binding of fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In the reverse reaction, the kinetics of wild-type and the Ser 72 mutant with respect to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate are hyperbolic, whereas those of the Ser 162 and Ser 243 mutants are sigmoidal. These results show that each of the three arginines contributes to cooperativity and to the transmission of allosteric signals between the four subunit of the enzyme.\r"

These findings support the sensitivity of these neuropsychological instruments for detecting cognitive changes that may be related to HIV-1, and are consistent with other reports of neuropsychological abnormalities in symptomatic HIV-1-infected individuals. Asymptomatic seropositive men, on the other hand, did not differ significantly from seronegative subjects on any of the neuropsychological measures. Only 5.5% of the asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositive men showed abnormal performance on individual tests. This proportion did not differ significantly from that of seronegative controls. Further, among asymptomatic seropositive subjects, we found no statistically significant differences as a function of duration of HIV infection or level of immune system functioning. Thus, results from this study support the hypothesis that the frequency of neuropsychological abnormalities in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected homosexual men is low, and not statistically different from that of seronegative controls.\r"

The mnemonics, collectively known as the Ancient Art of Memory, were discovered in 447 BC by a Greek poet, Simonides, and were adequately described by Cicero, Quintilian, and Pliny. These arts fell into neglect after Alaric sacked Rome in 410 AD, but were subsequently revived in 1323 by Saint Thomas Aquinas, who transferred them from a division of rhetoric to ethics and used them to recall Catholic doctrine and versions of biblical history. In 1540 Saint Ignatius Loyola used mnemonic images to affirm the faith with his newly formed Society of Jesus and tried to convert the Ming dynasty in China by teaching these memory skills to Chinese nobles. Today, the ancient memory arts have applications in pilot training, gambling, mentalism and telepathy demonstrations, and may have a role in the rehabilitation of brain-damaged patients. Objective testing confirms that with the use of these memory skills, recall is increased, at least 10-fold, and the memory deficits of proactive and retroactive inhibition do not exist.\r"

Delivery occurred an average of 30 +/- 26 days after the diagnosis of intrauterine fetal death. Four of the five placentas were monochorionic. All nine infants survived, but four were small for gestational age (SGA). A comparison of study cases and controls revealed that monochorionic placentation was found only in the study group, that SGA infants were more likely (but not significantly so) to be in the study group, and that study infants required significantly less ventilatory support. Although the only case of long-term morbidity was in the study group, the cause of this complication was consistent with prematurity.\r"

However, few data exist on the significance of elevated S/D ratios for pregnancies in which outcome does not involve an SGA infant. Pulsed Doppler spectral recordings and level II ultrasound examinations were performed 373 times in 256 referred high-risk patients. Doppler data were not used for patient management decisions. Thirty-two women with elevated umbilical artery S/D ratios of 4.5 or greater (defined as abnormal regardless of gestational age) gave birth to non-SGA infants. The ultrasound characteristics and outcome for this group were compared with those of 200 patients who were also non-SGA but who exhibited normal waveforms and with 24 SGA infants with predominantly abnormal waveforms. Thirty-one percent of the non-SGA infants with abnormal waveforms had structural malformations, a rate significantly higher (P less than or equal to .03) than the 18% malformation rate in the normal-waveform group. Further, the stillbirth rate and number of terminations of pregnancy for lethal anomalies were five times greater in the non-SGA group with abnormal waveforms than in the non-SGA group with normal waveforms (P less than or equal to .001). A wide variety of structural malformations was observed in the abnormal-waveform group, most frequently involving the central nervous system. Amniotic fluid volume tended to be decreased in the SGA group, whereas increased amniotic fluid volume or hydramnios was seen in 23% of the non-SGA abnormal-waveform group.\r"

The fetal renal artery was studied at its origin from the aorta before and during the first 24 hours of indomethacin therapy. Seven fetuses manifested ductal constriction. Three fetuses also manifested tricuspid regurgitation. All ductal constrictions and the tricuspid regurgitations resolved in utero after discontinuation of indomethacin. There were no significant differences in the pulsatility index values of the renal artery before and during indomethacin therapy. These results suggest that there is no change in fetal renovascular parameters detectable with pulsatility index measurements during the first 24 hours of maternal indomethacin therapy.\r"

The overall regimen clinical success rates were 100 and 91% for the clindamycin/tobramycin and clindamycin-alone groups, respectively. Efficacy for patients with positive pre-treatment Neisseria gonorrhoeae cultures was eight of eight (100%) for the clindamycin/tobramycin group and seven of eight (88%) in the clindamycin-alone group. Of the total population studied, 15 of 51 (29%) had positive pre-treatment cultures for Chlamydia trachomatis, and a microbiologic cure was attained in 15 of 15 (100%). However, in two of 15 (14.5%), the patient did not return for the 6-week culture, although the culture at discharge from the hospital was negative. No serious adverse reactions were observed, although oral follow-up treatment with clindamycin had to be discontinued in one patient because of diarrhea, which resolved without additional therapy. The results suggest that intravenous clindamycin alone is a viable alternative to the use of clindamycin/tobramycin for women with acute pelvic inflammatory disease requiring hospitalization.\r"

Compared with the standard of HSV-positive cell cultures, 24 (65%) of 37 positive HC tests and 22 (59%) of 37 positive IF tests were significantly more sensitive (P less than 0.0005) than the AGG (3%, 1/37) and 1EIA (26%, 1/34) tests. The HC and IF tests were 100% specific, and easy to interpret. In addition, the clinical diagnosis of HSV infection after a thorough ophthalmologic examination was as sensitive (59%, 22/37) (P = 0.4) as any of the immunologic tests. In conclusion, for definitive diagnosis of HSV, the HC test seems more suitable for a central laboratory that handles a large number of viral specimens, and processes HC-negative tests with follow-up cell culture isolation. The enzyme immunofiltration test seems more suitable for a low-volume viral laboratory which confirms all IF test samples with follow-up cell culture isolation.\r"

This allowed analysis of improved graft survival due to changes in management, introduced after critical review of the first group in 1978. The salient changes included transition from intracapsular to extracapsular cataract surgery (P = 0.001) and treatment of rejection episodes with antiviral prophylaxis. Extracapsular cataract surgery improved graft survival (P = 0.07) benefiting inflamed eyes which more frequently required concomitant surgery (P = 0.005). Survival of rejection episodes was improved by antiviral prophylaxis (P = 0.02), and the incidence of recurrent keratitis was reduced (P = 0.0005). The complete and prompt removal of loose sutures improved graft survival (P = 0.025).

Results of histopathologic study show a well-circumscribed lesion without a true capsule with alveolar or organoid arrangements of epithelioid cells within a reticulin framework with thin-walled blood vessels. Cells are polygonal with round or oval nuclei containing rare mitotic figures and pale-staining cytoplasm. Differential diagnosis includes alveolar soft-part sarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, carcinoid, and granular cell tumor. Of 29 previously reported cases of orbital NCP, 16 have been reclassified as alveolar soft-part sarcoma.

For small fistulae, the opening is first closed with a mucosal turnover flap; this is combined on the orbital surface with a local rotational advancement flap of the orbital skin. For larger fistulae where a mucosal turnover flap cannot be fashioned, a two-stage, delayed, composite mucocutaneous rotational flap is used. The advantages of these techniques are: (1) a mucous membrane to provide nasal or sinus lining, insulating the raw ventral surface of the skin flap; (2) each flap has an independent blood supply; (3) local flaps are used, avoiding the use of a pedicle flap from forehead; (4) excellent cosmesis since tissues outside the orbital rim are not disturbed; and (5) does not require refitting of exenteration prosthesis since the integrity of the orbital rim is maintained. The authors have used these techniques in six patients with chronic sino-orbital fistulae of the exenterated socket. In one patient, a wound dehiscence occurred and a small fistula measuring 3 to 4 mm in diameter persisted. The fistulae of the remaining five patients were successfully closed.\r"

Improvements in hydroxylapatite provided a material that could be used for alveolar ridge augmentation. It proved effective in limiting resorption and increasing attachment to soft and hard tissue.

In eligible patients the use of osteointegrated implants can provide rigid stabilization for dental prostheses. In previous studies these implants were placed in a secondary procedure.

A standard reporting format that includes the extent of the disease, the eustachian tube function, the integrity of the ossicles, and a uniform description of the surgical procedure would enhance future evaluations of this disease. The future of otology still lies in finding new ways to eradicate this disease and to avoid recidivism.\r"

  ".W": "Acquired cholesteatoma is a disease of the posterior superior part of the middle ear cleft that may arise from the external epithelium of the tympanic membrane. Three distinct epithelial zones of differing thicknesses characterize the development of this latter epithelium, and the thickness differences and their distribution in the eardrum and deep external canal, which delineate the zones, are found at all stages of life, including the mature ear. It is postulated that epithelial migratory activity follows the pathways of early development, the flow occurring through the three zones. The detailed validity of this model was confirmed by otoscopic photography of dye movements on the tympanic membrane. Cholesteatoma may develop from the earliest and most active of these zones situated on the pars flaccida. The pathologic anatomy of cholesteatoma suggests vigorous growth. Retraction pockets provide a source for bands of squamous epithelium growing into the middle ear. Cholesteatoma and tympanic membrane epithelium move en masse in tissue culture, a property not shown by any other stratified squamous epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "Meticulous mastoid surgery does not always result in a dry, stable ear. Eustachian tube malfunction has been accepted as an important factor in chronic and recurrent middle ear infection. There are many parameters of eustachian tube malfunction, which form a complicated problem for investigation and analysis. Of most importance appears to be varying degrees of malformation of the nasopharynx and palate. A gradient from mild to overt deformity appears to be related to the degree of eustachian tube function. Other factors, such as nasal infection and allergy, nasopharyngeal scar tissue and tumors, and general resistance to infection, are of less importance but must be considered in the etiology of chronic ear disease. Tympanoplasty is relatively unsuccessful in a chronic discharging ear, as the infection ultimately destroys a surgical repair. Persistent otorrhea can be caused by either eustachian tube malfunction or a reservoir of chronic infection in the mastoid cavity. A mastoidectomy often controls the infection in the mastoid cells and a tympanoplasty may be done as a secondary procedure when the cavity is stable. A careful preoperative evaluation should be made in every case to determine the responsible factors for persistent ear infection. If possible, attempts should be made to eliminate the causative factors prior to the tympanoplasty. Classification of cases into four groups helps to separate those cases with a good prognosis from those that will continue to suppurate and will have a poor functional result. A dual classification of tympanoplasty has been established in which the type of reconstruction is documented and the stability of the ear against infection is estimated. Classified clinical material forms the basis for a clearer representation of the cases under investigation and the results of tympanoplastic surgery become statistically comparable. Classification of cases also aids in the selection of cases for surgery by identifying preoperatively those cases that will be successful from those that may not have a good result. With this information at hand it is possible to more accurately inform the patient preoperatively regarding hearing improvement and control of infection following a tympanoplasty.\r"

The evidence that these lesions are congenital in origin includes the young mean age of presentation, the normal appearance of the middle ear mucosa in almost all cases of small lesions, normal mastoid pneumatization documented by computerized tomography, the relatively large number of children with associated minor or major congenital malformations, and the consistent 3:1 ratio of males to females with the disorder in all of the large series reviewed. A direct relationship between congenital cholesteatomas (epidermoids) of the middle ear and the epidermoid formation is supported by the position of the epidermoid formation at a histologic transition zone in the anterior superior lateral quadrant of the tympanic cavity, which is also the site of greatest occurrence of congenital cholesteatomas. The epidermoid formation may not always involute and as it expands it would be expected to become visible medial to the tympanic membrane in the anterior superior quadrant. It seems evident that as the congenital cholesteatoma expands it can block the eustachian tube; during a bout of otitis media the tympanic membrane could perforate and the cholesteatoma could become secondarily infected. The congenital cholesteatoma in this situation would be difficult or impossible to distinguish from the more common acquired type.\r"

  ".U": "90137901\r", 
  ".W": "The octapeptide form of CCK predominates in the central nervous system (CNS) of mammalian species, including man. Many of the physiological roles of CCK in the CNS are unknown, but it is believed to be involved in nociception. CCK is distributed throughout cortical grey matter, periaqueductal grey matter, ventromedial thalamus and spinal dorsal horn, all of which are areas known to be associated with pain modulation. CCK receptor subtypes have been identified and may be classified according to their affinity for the sulphated and desulphated forms of CCK-8 and the recently described selective antagonist. MK-329. CCK-A receptors have high affinity for sulphated CCK-8 and for MK-329 but low affinity for desulphated CCK-8 and CCK-4 whilst CCK-B sites bind MK-329 with low affinity and discriminate poorly between sulphated and desulphated CCK-8. CCK-A receptors are found predominantly in peripheral tissues but they also exist in discrete regions of the primate CNS, including the spinal cord. CCK-B receptors are found ubiquitously throughout other regions of the neuraxis. The results of studies on the effects of CCK-8 and the decapeptide analogue caerulein on pain thresholds are conflicting. Some workers suggest that large doses of CCK-8 and caerulein induce naloxone-reversible analgesia in certain pain models. However, it appears likely that analgesia induced by large doses of CCK and caerulein in animals may be a pharmacological rather than a physiological phenomenon. Accordingly, others have found that small (and most probably, physiological) doses of CCK-8 attenuate the analgesic effects of morphine, and of endogenous opioids. Thus, it has been proposed that CCK may act as an endogenous opiate antagonist. Studies in rats with the selective CCK antagonist MK-329 have helped clarify the interaction between CCK and morphine-induced analgesia. Treatment with MK-329 enhances morphine analgesia and chronic treatment with MK-329 prevents the development of tolerance to morphine analgesia. However, the antagonist does not prevent naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms in morphine-dependent rats. In man, caerulein prevents pain associated with gall-bladder contraction, probably by relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi. Caerulein has also been shown to reduce renal colic and the pain of intermittent claudication. Preliminary clinical studies with the weak, non-selective, CCK antagonist proglumide, indicate an enhancement of morphine analgesia. As yet, no studies have demonstrated analgesic effects of CCK antagonists in man when administered alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

There is therefore an urgent need for simple and reliable methods of diagnosing HIV infection in these infants. The sensitivity and specificity of a test using the in vitro antibody production of HIV-specific IgG was assessed in children whose infection status was known and compared with virus and antigen detection. In vitro antibody production sensitivity was 90 to 95%, at least as sensitive as virus culture in antibody-positive infected children. In the first 2 months there is a relatively high proportion of false positive results, possibly a result of contamination by maternal cells. However, after this period in vitro antibody production is a simple, inexpensive and reliable tool for early diagnosis.\r"

After 2 weeks of treatment resolution rates of chronic otitis media with effusion in the prednisone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole groups were significantly greater than those in the control (no treatment) and ibuprofen groups. After 4 weeks the differences in resolution rates between the control, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and prednisone groups became smaller. After 12 months of follow-up, differences in hearing sensitivity among study groups were not statistically significant, although 83% of patients had a 15-dB or greater hearing loss.

On entry in the study the clinical characteristics of the two treatment groups were comparable. The duration of therapy was 14.9 +/- 3.6 days for the aztreonam group and 12.8 +/- 2.6 days for the chloramphenicol group. The mean duration of fever was 5.9 +/- 3.1 days and 4.05 +/- 2.1 days for aztreonam and chloramphenicol groups respectively (P greater than 0.05). Clinical cure was observed in all patients treated with aztreonam and in 17 of 18 children given chloramphenicol; one patient died in the latter group. There were no relapses in either group. We observed clinical adverse reactions during the treatment with aztreonam in 2 patients. All strains of Salmonella typhi were susceptible to aztreonam, 1 strain was resistant to chloramphenicol and 3 strains were resistant to ampicillin. Aztreonam appears to be a satisfactory alternative to chloramphenicol in cases of typhoid fever caused by resistant strains or when chloramphenicol is contraindicated.\r"

A normal serum iron level excludes iron deficiency anemia and indicates other causes for microcytic anemia. Often, a low serum iron level and total iron-binding capacity are due to chronic disease, and measurement of serum ferritin or a bone marrow stain for hemosiderin will be necessary to diagnose iron deficiency. Iron therapy to restore the red cell mass should be continued until iron stores are replenished.\r"

Complementation of this defect, in trans, restores infectious particle production. The nonmyristoylated (myr-) gag precursor accumulates in infected cells and is not processed into the mature capsid components of the intact virion. However, myr- Pr55gag can be processed by purified HIV protease in vitro, demonstrating that the myristoyl moiety is not required for cleavage by the protease. Myristoylation of Pr55gag is not necessary for localization but is required for stable membrane association and assembly of HIV-1.\r"

In 32P-labeled cells, these agents induced serine 32P-phosphorylation of a 135-kDa particulate protein and, to a variable and lesser extent, a 44-kDa protein, which were selectively immunoprecipitated by anti-cAMP-PDE, as analyzed by SDS/PAGE and autoradiography. In the absence of hormonal stimulation, little phosphorylation was detected (less than 10% of that with the hormones). The two phosphoproteins were identified as cAMP-PDE or a closely related molecule (in the case of the 44-kDa species, perhaps a proteolytic fragment) since (i) amounts of 32P in the immunoprecipitated 135-kDa protein paralleled enzyme inactivation, (ii) prior incubation of the anti-cAMP-PDE with the pure rat or bovine enzyme selectively blocked the immunoprecipitation of the phosphoproteins, (iii) 135- and 44-kDa proteins reacted with the anti-cAMP-PDE on Western immunoblots, and (iv) the two phosphoproteins copurified with cAMP-PDE activity through DEAE-Sephacel chromatography and were isolated by highly selective affinity chromatography on cilostamide-agarose. Thus, in fat cells, catecholamine- and insulin-induced activation of the cAMP-PDE may be mediated via phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and an insulin-activated serine protein kinase, respectively.\r"

Analysis of the selD gene product through expression of the gene in the phage T7 promoter/polymerase system confirmed the predicted molecular weight of the protein. Gene disruption experiments demonstrated that the SelD protein is required both for the incorporation of selenium into the modified nucleoside 5-methylaminomethyl-2-selenouridine of tRNA and for the biosynthesis of selenocysteine from an L-serine residue esterbonded to tRNA(Ser)(UCA). tRNA(Ser)(UCA) has been purified, aminoacylated with L-serine, and used as a substrate for the development of an in vitro system for selenocysteine biosynthesis. Efficient formation of selenocysteinyl-tRNA(Ser)(UCA) was achieved by using extracts in which both the selD and the selA gene products were overproduced. The results demonstrate that selenocysteine is synthesized from L-serine bound to tRNA(UCA) and they are in accord with SelD functioning as a donor of reduced selenium.\r"

A modification of the polymerase chain reaction can be used in patients to detect low levels of the BCR-ABL-encoded mRNA transcript, a specific marker for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Early detection of relapse after bone marrow transplantation could potentially alter treatment decisions. We prospectively evaluated 19 patients for evidence of molecular relapse, cytogenetic relapse, and clinical relapse after bone marrow transplantation. We used the polymerase chain reaction to detect residual BCR-ABL mRNA in patients followed up to 45 months after treatment (median, 15 months; range, 6-45 months) and found 4 patients with BCR-ABL mRNA expression following bone marrow transplantation. In 2 patients BCR-ABL mRNA was detected in all samples, and both have developed cytogenetic relapse. In 1 patient BCR-ABL mRNA was detected transiently during the first month after transplant but was undetectable thereafter. The fourth patient had BCR-ABL mRNA 6 months after bone marrow transplantation but not in prior samples. Fifteen patients did not express detectable BCR-ABL mRNA. All 19 patients remain in clinical remission. In this prospective study of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients treated with bone marrow transplantation, molecular relapse preceded cytogenetic relapse in those patients who persistently express BCR-ABL mRNA. We recommend using standard clinical and cytogenetic testing to make patient care decisions until further follow-up determines the clinical outcome of those patients with residual BCR-ABL mRNA transcripts detected by polymerase chain reaction.\r"

This 10-base sequence is adjacent to an 8-base consensus sequence at -147 to -155 that is present in the promoter region of several elicitor-inducible genes from various other plants.

These amino acid residues were targeted for mutagenesis on the basis of sequence homology among xylose isomerases isolated from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Ampullariella sp. strain 3876, and Streptomyces violaceus-niger. Each residue was selectively replaced by site-directed mutagenesis and shown to be essential for activity. No measurable activity was observed for any mutations replacing either His-101 or His-271. Circular dichroism measurements revealed no significant change in the overall conformation of the mutant enzymes, and all formed dimers similar to the wild-type enzyme. Mutations at His-271 could be distinguished from those at His-101, since the former resulted in a thermolabile protein whereas no significant change in heat stability was observed for the latter. Based upon these results and structural data recently reported, we speculate that His-101 is the catalytic base mediating the reaction. Replacement of His-271 may render the enzyme thermolabile, since this residue appears to be a ligand for one of the metal ions in the active site of the enzyme.\r"

The mammalian protein is highly regulated in both somatic and germ-line cells. In addition, the toxicity of certain alkylating drugs in tumor and normal cells is inversely related to the levels of this protein. The cDNA of the human gene, henceforth named MGMT, has been cloned in an expression vector on the basis of its rescue of a methyltransferase-deficient (ada-) Escherichia coli host. A 22-kDa active methyltransferase encoded entirely by the cDNA contains an amino acid sequence of 61 residues that bears 60-65% similarity with segments of E. coli methyltransferase (products of the ada and ogt genes), which encompass the alkyl-acceptor residues. The human cDNA has no sequence similarity with the ada and ogt genes, due in part to differences in codon usage, and shows no detectable homology with E. coli genomic DNA. However, it hybridizes with distinct restriction fragments of human, mouse, and rat DNAs. The lack of methyltransferase observed in many human cell lines is due to the absence of the MGMT gene or to lack of synthesis and/or stability of its 0.95-kilobase poly(A)+ RNA transcript.\r"

Transformation of an isomerase-minus strain of Escherichia coli was followed by selection of those colonies harboring an enzyme of higher catalytic potency. Six amino acid changes in the Glu-165----Asp mutant of triosephosphate isomerase improve the specific catalytic activity of this enzyme (from 1.3-fold to 19-fold). The suppressor sites are scattered across the sequence (at positions 10, 96, 97, 167, and 233), but each of them is very close to the active site.

  ".W": "The type II beta regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (RII beta) has been hypothesized to play an important role in the growth inhibition and differentiation induced by site-selective cAMP analogs in human cancer cells, but direct proof of this function has been lacking. To address this issue, HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells were exposed to RII beta antisense synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide, and the effects on cAMP-induced growth regulation were examined. Exposure of these cells to RII beta antisense oligodeoxynucleotide resulted in a decrease in cAMP analog-induced growth inhibition and differentiation without apparent effect on differentiation induced by phorbol esters. This loss in cAMP growth regulatory function correlated with a decrease in basal and induced levels of RII beta protein. Exposure to RII beta sense, RI alpha and RII alpha antisense, or irrelevant oligodeoxynucleotides had no such effect. These results show that the RII beta regulatory subunit of protein kinase plays a critical role in the cAMP-induced growth regulation of HL-60 leukemia cells.\r"

  ".W": "Transplacental exposure of rats to a single dose of the direct acting carcinogen methylnitrosourea (MNU) results in the induction of a variety of neoplasias of neuroectodermal, epithelial, and mesenchymal origin. Molecular analysis of the oncogenes present in these tumors revealed a striking degree of tissue specificity. neu oncogenes were found to be reproducibly activated in tumors derived from the peripheral nervous system (PNS), but not in those arising from the central nervous system (CNS). No ras oncogenes were found in either PNS- or CNS-derived tumors. However, Ha-ras oncogenes were detected in each of three mammary carcinomas and Ki-ras oncogenes were present in each of five kidney mesenchymal tumors. These results illustrate that phenotypic expression of activated oncogenes in vivo is not a random process and suggest that normal developmental programs may play an important role in modulating the activation of specific oncogenes by chemical carcinogens. PCR analysis revealed that each of the ras oncogenes detected in these transplacentally induced tumors became activated by the same G----A transition in the second base of codon 12. Since G----A transitions are the preferred mutations induced by MNU, it is likely that these ras oncogenes may have been directly targeted by MNU during embryonic development.\r"

The combination of activation of transcription by the Tat protein and the influence of the Rev protein on processing of RNA leads to a regulatory loop that can have multiple expression rates. In the lower state, the regulatory loop leads to low, or no, production of virus, which corresponds to its quiescent state. Conversely, when the regulatory loop is in the upper state, active production of virus is maintained over time. These features of the kinetic model have implications for both human immunodeficiency virus-related illness and therapeutics and predict testable experimental results in vitro.\r"

Tissues analyzed contained histopathologic lesions including abnormal vacuolation, biliary proliferation, and, in many cases, hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinomas. Fibroblasts transfected with liver DNA samples from 7 of 13 diseased animals were effective in the induction of subcutaneous sarcomas in nude mice. Further analysis revealed the presence of flounder c-Ki-ras oncogenes in all 10 nude mouse subcutaneous tumors analyzed. Direct DNA sequencing and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization following amplification of the tumor DNA by the polymerase chain reaction showed mutations in the 12th codon in this gene. Analysis of DNA from all nude mouse tumors as well as the livers from which they were derived showed mutations at this codon. The mutations comprised G.C----A.T or G.C----T.A base changes resulting in substitution of serine, valine, or cysteine for glycine. Liver DNA samples from five histologically normal livers of animals from a less polluted site were ineffective in the transfection assay and showed only wild-type DNA sequences (GGT) at the 12th codon of c-Ki-ras. The prevalence of mutations in this gene region was associated with the presence of liver lesions and could signify DNA damage resulting from environmental chemical exposure.\r"

These five snRNAs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae show notable size and sequence differences from their metazoan counterparts. This is most striking for the large S. cerevisiae U1 and U2 snRNAs, for which no secondary structure models currently exist. Because of the importance of U1 snRNA in the early steps of \"spliceosome\" assembly, we wanted to compare the highly conserved secondary structure of metazoan U1 snRNA (approximately 165 nucleotides) with that of S. cerevisiae U1 snRNA (568 nucleotides). To this end, we have cloned and sequenced the U1 gene from two other yeast species possessing large U1 RNAs. Using computer-derived structure predictions, phylogenetic comparisons, and structure probing, we have arrived at a secondary structure model for S. cerevisiae U1 snRNA. The results show that most elements of higher eukaryotic U1 snRNA secondary structure are conserved in S. cerevisiae. The hundreds of \"extra\" nucleotides of yeast U1 RNA, also highly structured, suggest that large insertions and/or deletions have occurred during the evolution of the U1 gene.\r"

  ".W": "Photocycle and flash-induced proton release and uptake were investigated for bacteriorhodopsin mutants in which Asp-85 was replaced by Ala, Asn, or Glu; Asp-212 was replaced by Asn or Glu; Asp-115 was replaced by Ala, Asn, or Glu; Asp-96 was replaced by Ala, Asn, or Glu; and Arg-82 was replaced by Ala or Gln in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1- propanesulfonate micelles at pH 7.3. In the Asp-85----Ala and Asp-85----Asn mutants, the absence of the charged carboxyl group leads to a blue chromophore at 600 and 595 nm, respectively, and lowers the pK of the Schiff base deprotonation to 8.2 and 7, respectively, suggesting a role for Asp-85 as counterion to the Schiff base. The early part of the photocycles of the Asp-85----Ala and Asp-85----Asn mutants is strongly perturbed; the formation of a weak M-like intermediate is slowed down about 100-fold over wild type. In both mutants, proton release is also slower but clearly precedes the rise of M. The amplitude of the early (less than 0.2 microseconds) reversed photovoltage component in the Asp-85----Asn mutant is very large, and the net charge displacement is close to zero, indicating proton release and uptake on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The data suggest an obligatory role for Asp-85 in the efficient deprotonation of the Schiff base and in the proton release phase, probably as proton acceptor. In the Asp-212----Asn mutant, the rise of the absorbance change at 410 nm is slowed down to 220 microsecond, its amplitude is small, and the release of protons is delayed to 1.9 ms. The absorbance changes at 650 nm indicate perturbations in the early time range with a slow K intermediate. Thus Asp-212 also participates in the early events of charge translocation and deprotonation of the Schiff base. In the Arg-82----Gln mutant, no net transient proton release was observed, whereas, in the Arg-82----Ala mutant, uptake and release were reversed. The pK shift of the purple-to-blue transition in the Asp-85----Glu, Arg-82----Ala, and Arg-82----Gln mutants and the similarity in the photocycle and photoelectrical signals of the Asp-85----Ala, Asp-85----Asn, and Asp-212----Asn mutants suggest the interaction between Asp-85, Arg-82, Asp-212, and the Schiff base as essential for proton release.\r"

All three cooperate to stimulate processive DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase delta on a primed single-stranded M13 template DNA and as such can be categorized as DNA polymerase accessory proteins. Biochemical analyses with highly purified RF-C and PCNA have demonstrated functions that are completely analogous to the functions of bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase accessory proteins. A primer-template-specific DNA binding activity and a DNA-dependent ATPase activity copurified with the multisubunit protein RF-C and are similar to the functions of the phage T4 gene 44/62 protein complex. Furthermore, PCNA stimulated the RF-C ATPase activity and is, therefore, analogous to the phage T4 gene 45 protein, which stimulates the ATPase function of the gene 44/62 protein complex. Indeed, some primary sequence similarities between human PCNA and the phage T4 gene 45 protein could be detected. These results demonstrate a striking conservation of the DNA replication apparatus in human cells and bacteriophage T4.\r"

  ".W": "The 530 stem-loop region in 16S rRNA is among the most phylogenetically conserved structural elements in all rRNAs, yet its role in protein synthesis remains mysterious. G-530 is protected from kethoxal attack when tRNA, or its 15-nucleotide anticodon stem-loop fragment, is bound to the ribosomal A site. Based on presently available evidence, however, this region is believed to be too remote from the decoding site for this protection to be the result of direct contact. In this study, we use a conditional rRNA expression system to demonstrate that plasmid-encoded 16S rRNA genes carrying A, C, and T point mutations at position G-530 confer a dominant lethal phenotype when expressed in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the distribution of plasmid-encoded 16S rRNA in ribosomal particles, following induction of the A-530 mutation, shows that mutant rRNA is present both in 30S subunits and in 70S ribosomes. Little mutant rRNA is found in polyribosomes, however, indicating that the mutant ribosomes are severely impaired at the stage of polysome formation and/or stability. Detailed chemical probing of mutant ribosomal particles reveals no evidence of structural perturbation within the 16S rRNA. Taken together, these results argue for the direct participation of G-530 in ribosomal function and, furthermore, suggest that the dominant lethal phenotype caused by these mutations is due primarily to the mutant ribosomes blocking a crucial step in protein synthesis after translational initiation.\r"

The major transcription initiation start sites were identified, and the pertinent sequences surrounding the ETS2 promoter were determined. The promoter region of ETS2 does not possess typical \"TATA\" and \"CAAT\" elements. However, this promoter contains several repeat regions, as well as two consensus AP2 binding sites and three putative Sp1 sites. There is also a palindromic region similar to the serum response element of the c-fos gene, located 1400 base pairs (bp) upstream from the first major transcription initiation site. A G + C-rich sequence (GC element) with dyad symmetry can be seen in the ETS2 promoter, immediately following an unusually long (approximately 250-bp) polypurine-polypyrimidine tract. A series of deletion fragments from the putative promoter region were ligated in front of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and tested for activity following transfection into HeLa cells. The 5' boundary of the region needed for maximum promoter activity was found to be 159 bp upstream of the major initiation site. This region of 159 bp contains putative binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and AP2 (one for each), the GC element, one small forward repeat, one inverted repeat, and half of the polypurine-pyrimidine tract. The promoter of ETS2 (within the polypyrimidine tract) serves to illustrate an alternative structure that may be present in genes with \"TATA-less\" promoters.\r"

This cDNA was then amplified in a polymerase chain reaction with selective primers containing Sal I and Kpn I restriction endonuclease sites. Amplified cDNA was then directionally ligated into M13mp18 and M13mp19 bacteriophage and was sequenced. The nucleotide sequence encoding this peptide was identical to that of mouse pituitary corticotropin (ACTH). Elevated levels of lymphocyte immunoreactive ACTH were then induced with bacterial lipopolysaccharide and the peptide(s) was purified by antibody affinity chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The predominant immunoreactive ACTH species was approximately 3 kDa and its sequence was identical to pituitary ACTH(1-25). These results conclusively demonstrate that lymphocytes produce authentic ACTH and harbor its mRNA.\r"

At both the permissive and restrictive temperatures, daughter cells are produced that lack a detectable vacuole or contain a very small vacuole. In zygotes, vacuoles from a vac1-1 strain are defective as donors, or recipients, of the vesicles of intervacuole vesicular traffic. These defects are specific for the vacuole in that the segregation of nuclear DNA and of mitochondria into the bud appears normal.

Additionally, MR was detected in the distal tubules, the medullary and papillary collecting ducts, and in the epithelial cells lining the papilla. The internal image properties of the antibody were exploited to assess the specificity of MR detection by means of competition studies with hormones and antihormones. Immunostaining was completely abolished by preincubation with aldosterone but not with RU 486, a steroid antagonist that does not bind MR. On the cellular level, immunostaining occurred in the cytoplasm and, in the majority of cells, in the nucleus as well. The nucleocytoplasmic distribution of MR was unaffected by adrenalectomy or by administration of aldosterone. The availability of this specific monoclonal antibody makes it feasible to study MR expression in other target tissues and in pathological disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Plasmid p15B of Escherichia coli 15T- carries a 3.5-kilobase segment that undergoes frequent DNA inversion mediated by the DNA inversion enzyme Min, a member of the Din family of site-specific recombinases. While the previously described Din inversion systems invert a DNA segment between two crossover sites in inverted orientation, the Min system produces more complex DNA rearrangements. These have been physically characterized by electron microscopy and by restriction cleavage analysis. The results can best be explained by a model that involves six crossover sites (called mix) and predicts 240 isomeric forms of the invertible region. The model was confirmed by sequencing the six mix sites in plasmids that contain the invertible DNA segments in a frozen configuration. All mix sites fit the dix consensus sequence, and they are all good substrates for DNA inversion when carried in inverted orientation. Recombination between two mix sites in direct orientation was rare, in line with the notion that Din inversion systems are topologically biased to the inversion reaction. Another recently described multiple inversion system, the shufflon of the E. coli plasmid R64, is neither functionally nor structurally related to the Min system of p15B.\r"

  ".W": "In the vertebrate embryo, Schwann cells lining the peripheral nerves originate from the neural crest (NC), a structure that also gives rise to ganglion satellite cells, most of the neurons of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and part of the cranial mesenchyme. We have studied the emergence of the Schwann cell lineage in vitro in clonal cultures of quail mesencephalic NC cells by using the Schwann cell myelin protein antigen as an early and specific marker for myelinating and nonmyelinating cells. After 13-16 days in culture, numerous clones contained Schwann cell myelin protein-positive cells, sometimes isolated and sometimes associated with other NC-derived cell types. Detailed phenotypic analysis of the clones allowed us to infer the presence of differently committed Schwann-cell ancestors in the NC during the migration stage. In particular, we found evidence for the existence of a bipotent precursor of Schwann cells and nonneuronal satellite cells; a common precursor of neurons, satellite cells, and Schwann cells; and a pluripotent precursor of Schwann cells, satellite cells, neurons, and melanocytes. These founder cell types coexist in the NC with a committed Schwann cell progenitor of high-proliferative potential that differentiates in vitro in the absence of other peripheral cells and axons.\r"

In differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the derivative fully inhibits binding of 125I-labeled insulin to its receptor with about the same affinity as unlabeled insulin. In contrast, the dimerized derivative only partially (approximately 20%) mimics insulin's effects on glucose transport and DNA synthesis in the absence of insulin. In the presence of insulin, the agent competitively inhibits insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis ([3H]thymidine incorporation into total DNA), glucose transport activity (2-deoxyglucose uptake rate), and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. In rat adipocytes, in contrast, the dimerized derivative stimulates glucose transport (initial 3-O-methylglucose as well as 2-deoxyglucose uptake rates) to the same extent as insulin does, and it fails to inhibit the effect of insulin. The data indicate that the dimerized insulin derivative B29,B29'-suberoyl-insulin is an insulin receptor antagonist (partial agonist) which retains a moderate intrinsic activity. The effects of this agent reveal a striking difference in insulin receptor-mediated stimulation of glucose transport between 3T3-L1 fatty fibroblasts and the mature rat adipocyte.\r"

In the present study, nontumorigenic human epidermal keratinocytes immortalized by adenovirus type 12 and simian virus 40 have been transformed by exposure to x-ray irradiation. Such transformants showed morphological alterations, formed colonies in soft agar, and induced carcinomas when transplanted into nude mice, whereas primary human epidermal keratinocytes exposed to radiation in this manner failed to show any evidence of transformation. These findings demonstrate the malignant transformation of human primary epithelial cells in culture by the combined action of a DNA tumor virus and radiation, indicating a multistep process for radiation-induced neoplastic conversion. This in vitro system may be useful as a tool for dissecting the process of radiation-induced neoplastic transformation of human epithelial cells and for detecting previously unreported human oncogenes.\r"

  ".U": "90138964\r", 
  ".W": "The life span of neonatal rat cerebellar granule cells, grown in basal minimal Eagle's medium containing 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum, was extended to 21-30 days by weekly supplementation with glucose. Addition of 1% fetal calf serum to the culture at 14 days killed 85% of the cells within 1 hr. This lethal effect could be prevented by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists dibenzocyclohepteneimine (MK-801) and 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate (CPP). These findings suggested that the glutamate in the serum caused the dramatic neuronal death through action on the NMDA receptor. Indeed, a 5-min incubation in a Locke physiological salt solution containing 20 microM glutamate and 5 microM glycine killed 55-90% of the cells. This acute toxicity could be prevented by a lyso-GM1 ganglioside with N-acetylated sphingosine. The relatively low glutamate content of the sera analyzed suggests that factors in addition to glycine potentiate serum neurotoxicity. The above noted antagonists of the NMDA receptor also greatly reduced the lethal effect of depolarization by 90 mM KCl or 10 microM veratridine. Therefore, it is likely that the toxicity of the depolarizing agents is mediated by glutamate released from the cells. It is concluded that survival of cerebellar neurons in primary culture may be strongly affected by unsuspected neurotoxic phenomena elicited by brief action of a rather low glutamate concentration.\r"

RNAs with mutations designed to disrupt formation of a predicted stem structure no longer interact with Rev. However, Rev binding is restored upon annealing of the two complementary RNAs that make up the stem. These results suggest that direct interaction of Rev with the Rev-responsive element could facilitate transport of human immunodeficiency virus structural mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\r"

This approach is designed to determine the locations of positive clones within a YAC library that is stored as individual clones in 96-well microtiter plates. The high sensitivity and specificity of the PCR allow the detection of target sequences in DNA prepared from pools of 1920 or more YAC clones. The PCR-based screening protocol is performed in two successive stages, which effectively limit the location of a positive clone to four microtiter plates (384 clones). Final localization of each positive clone is accomplished by conventional DNA.DNA hybridization using a single filter containing the YAC clones from the appropriate four microtiter plates. This PCR-based screening strategy has proven highly efficient, allowing the identification and isolation of numerous YAC clones containing specific human genes. The prospects of developing a strategy for screening YAC libraries based completely on PCR assays are discussed, as are the potential applications of this approach to the systematic analysis of the human genome.\r"

This phenomenon involves the oxidation of one of the terminal guanidino nitrogen atoms of L-arginine, which results in the production of citrulline and inorganic nitrogen oxides (NO2-, NO3-, and NO). We report here the results of an electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic study performed on cytotoxic activated macrophage (CAM) effector cells, which develop the same pattern of metabolic inhibition as their targets. Examination of activated macrophages from mice infected with Mycobacterium bovis (strain bacillus Calmette-Guerin) that were cultured in medium with lipopolysaccharide and L-arginine showed the presence of an axial signal at g = 2.039, which is similar to previously described iron-nitrosyl complexes formed from the destruction of iron-sulfur centers by nitric oxide (NO). Inhibition of the L-arginine-dependent pathway by addition of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (methyl group on a terminal guanidino nitrogen) inhibits the production of nitrite, nitrate, citrulline, and the g = 2.039 signal. Comparison of the hyperfine structure of the signal from cells treated with L-arginine with terminal guanidino nitrogen atoms of natural abundance N14 atoms or labeled with N15 atoms showed that the nitrosyl group in this paramagnetic species arises from one of these two atoms. These results show that loss of iron-containing enzyme function in CAM is a result of the formation of iron-nitrosyl complexes induced by the synthesis of nitric oxide from the oxidation of a terminal guanidino nitrogen atom of L-arginine.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatopoietin-A (HPTA) is a heparin-binding polypeptide growth factor which consists of a heavy and a light polypeptide chain with molecular weights of 70,000 and 35,000, respectively. It stimulates DNA synthesis in primary cultures of normal rat hepatocytes in serum-free medium. The complete purification and characterization of HPTA from rabbit serum were reported by us elsewhere. Recently we have determined the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the rabbit HPTA light chain up to 24 residues and have shown that the sequence is not homologous with other known sequences. [N.B. Human hepatocyte growth factor, recently sequenced by two other groups, is the same molecular species as HPTA.] In the present paper we report the production of a neutralizing polyclonal antiserum raised in chicken against purified rabbit HPTA. This antiserum does not inhibit the mitogenic effect of other potent inducers of hepatocyte DNA synthesis (epidermal growth factor or acidic fibroblast growth factor), nor does it interact with these growth factors in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antibody recognizes HPTA, as was determined by Western immunoblotting. Since the tissue origin of HPTA is not known, this anti-HPTA antiserum was used to investigate the tissue distribution of HPTA in rabbits by immunohistostaining methods. Acinar cells of the pancreas, neurons of the brain, C cells of the thyroid, ductal cells of the salivary glands, and Brunners glands of the duodenum stained with anti-HPTA antibody. Liver, spleen, thymus, and kidney do not seem to contain appreciable amounts of HPTA. We confirmed these findings by extracting and purifying active HPTA from the stained tissues listed above. The anti-HPTA antibody recognizes HPTA purified from different tissues, as was determined by ELISA, Western immunoblotting, and immunoneutralization experiments.\r"

To isolate a cDNA encoding the murine IL-4 receptor, we have developed an expression cloning method that uses biotinylated ligand as a probe and that may be generally applicable to cloning of receptor genes. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the cloned full-length cDNA bind murine IL-4 specifically with a Kd = 165 pM. Crosslinking of 125I-labeled IL-4 to COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA reveals binding to proteins of 120-140 kDa. IL-4-responsive cells also express IL-4-binding proteins of 120-140 kDa but show additional bands at 60-70 kDa; the relationship of the smaller proteins to the larger ones is unclear. The nucleotide sequence indicates that the full-length cDNA encodes 810 amino acids including the signal sequence. While no consensus sequence for protein kinases is present in the cytoplasmic domain, a sequence comparison with the erythropoietin receptor, the IL-6 receptor, and the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor reveals a significant homology in the extracellular domain, indicating that the IL-4 receptor is a member of a cytokine receptor family.\r"

In the present study we examined the distribution of GS and CPS-I in pancreatic hepatocytes to ascertain if the expression of these two genes in these hepatocytes is also mutually exclusive. Multiple foci of hepatocytes showing no clear acinar organization develop in the adult rat pancreas as a result of a change in the differentiation commitment after dietary copper deficiency. Unlike liver, GS and CPS-I are detected by immunofluorescence in all pancreatic hepatocytes. In situ hybridization revealed that all pancreatic hepatocytes contain GS and CPS-I mRNAs. The sizes of these two mRNAs in pancreas with hepatocytes are similar to those of the liver. The concomitant expression of GS and CPS-I genes in pancreatic hepatocytes may be attributed, in part, to the absence of portal blood supply to the pancreas vis-a-vis the lack of hormonal/metabolic gradients as well as to possible matrix homogeneity in the pancreas.\r"

Another group of nude mice received an injection of microcapsules of the agonist [D-Trp6]LH-RH liberating 25 micrograms/day. One month after the initiation of treatment, the testicular weights were significantly reduced and the blood testosterone values were at castration levels in all treated groups. Histologically, only the testicles of the mice treated with SB-75 released from minipumps showed a significant decrease of meiosis. The most advanced forms of germ cells were spermatogonia in 26%, spermatocytes in 17%, and round spermatids in 35% of the seminiferous tubules. Only 22% of the tubules contained elongated spermatids. The suppression of meiotic activity by this modern LH-RH antagonist can possibly be used for the development of methods for male contraception and for the protection of germ cells against the damage caused by cytotoxic drugs and x-radiation.\r"

Spontaneous diabetes mellitus was blocked in NOD mice by long-term treatment with recombinant TNF-alpha. Treatment with TNF-alpha caused a significant reduction in the lymphocytic infiltration associated with the destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells. Class II major histocompatibility complex Ia expression by islet cells was not up-regulated by TNF-alpha. Moreover, TNF-alpha was able to suppress the induction of diabetes in adoptive transfer of lymphocytes from diabetic female mice to young nondiabetic male NOD mice. These activities of TNF-alpha were shared by interleukin 1 alpha in this system. These studies have implications for the pathogenesis and therapy of autoimmune diabetes mellitus.\r"

The purified lipoarabinomannans from M. leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis had a similar spectrum of inhibition whereas their deacylated derivatives were without effect. All mycobacterial preparations of either a crude or purified state, which suppressed cellular responses, contained appreciable quantities of bacterial lipopolysaccharide by the Limulus amebocyte assay. Contamination with lipopolysaccharide could account for the extent and nonselectivity of the T-cell suppression. Suppression was also monocyte-dependent and in part due to the release of arachidonate metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway.\r"

These included the duration of renal disease before biopsy, overall severity of SLE, as well as the presence of vasculitis, hypertension or a comorbid ailment. Furthermore, the study confirms the predictive importance of serum creatinine, 24-h urinary excretion of protein, C3, and of the activity and chronicity indices on biopsy. However, overall a simple measure of tubulointerstitial disease was the best predictor obtained from biopsy. Prognostic models based on clinical data alone were developed for each of the five outcomes. The models amplify our clinical understanding of lupus nephritis. Markers of renal severity were most important in predicting renal outcomes such as renal insufficiency and renal failure. Prognostic factors less directly related to renal disease (comorbidity and vasculitis) were important predictors of fatality. A marker of immunologic disease activity (C3) was a valuable predictor for many of the outcomes. Thus markers of disease severity reflecting organ damage due to SLE and other comorbid conditions could be combined with markers of immunologic activity to predict a variety of outcomes of relevance to a clinician. When biopsy data obtained by light or electron microscopy were evaluated for their ability to add new predictive information to the clinical models, only a limited value for biopsy was noted. It is likely that this reflected the close correlational relationships between clinical and biopsy variables, the strong clinical models generated, and the inclusion in the clinical models of the previously neglected clinical variables, duration of renal disease before biopsy and the presence of vasculitis or comorbid disease.\r"

  ".U": "90139552\r", 
  ".W": "Diastole can be divided into four phases: isovolumic relaxation, early filling, diastasis, and atrial systole. The amount of LV filling that occurs during each of these phases depends on myocardial relaxation, the passive characteristics of the LV, the characteristics of the left atrium, pulmonary veins, and mitral valve, and the heart rate. When diastolic function is normal, the net effect of these factors results in an LV filling sufficient to produce an adequate cardiac output, while mean pulmonary venous pressure is maintained below 12 mm Hg. In the absence of systolic dysfunction, abnormal diastolic performance is usually due to abnormal relaxation and/or changes in the passive LV characteristics. Invasive studies can quantitate the rate of myocardial relaxation and the LV diastolic pressure-volume relation. More recently, RNA and Doppler echocardiography have been used to noninvasively evaluate diastolic performance by determining the pattern of LV diastolic filling. At rest, most LV filling occurs early in diastole. Conditions that produce diastolic dysfunction, such as LV hypertrophy and ischemia, are associated with reduced early diastolic filling and an augmented importance of atrial systole. It is important to recognize that such patterns can occur in patients who do not have clinically apparent diastolic dysfunction and in normals. Furthermore, a normal pattern can occur in patients who have severe diastolic dysfunction. A reduced early diastolic filling, in the absence of pulmonary congestion, indicates the loss of diastolic reserve, since the left atrium is being used as a booster pump. This pattern of diastolic filling in a patient who has symptoms of pulmonary congestion may suggest diastolic dysfunction, even if the systolic LV performance is normal. Since diastolic filling of the LV results from a complex interplay of factors, it is unlikely that a single, easily interpreted index of LV diastolic performance will ever be developed. However, the recent development of a noninvasive evaluation of the pattern of LV diastolic filling by RNA or Doppler echocardiography is an important advance. When interpreted with an understanding of the determinants of LV filling and the patient's clinical status, these noninvasive tests can contribute to the rational assessment of LV diastolic performance.\r"

Some of these organisms are classified as relatively resistant to penicillin on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) greater than 0.1-0.2 microgram/mL. Almost all authorities recommend that endocarditis caused by relatively resistant streptococci be treated with high doses of penicillin combined with 2-6 weeks of an aminoglycoside rather than the potentially shorter, less toxic, and more flexible regimens used for exquisitely sensitive streptococci (MIC, less than 0.1-0.2 microgram of penicillin/mL). The data to support this recommendation are limited and inconclusive. We review the relevant clinical experience, experimental models, and theoretical considerations. Penicillin alone is probably adequate therapy for most cases of native valve endocarditis caused by relatively resistant streptococci; in certain patients, it may be the preferred treatment.\r"

Participants from developing countries provided estimates of use of antibiotics and problems of resistance in their countries. Because much of the information either is anecdotal or may not be representative of the vast, heterogenous populations in these countries, it is difficult to provide exact guidelines for the use of antibiotics. There is a need for better etiologic definition of the causes of acute respiratory tract infection and diarrheal disease and for surveillance of resistant bacterial strains. Because of the difficulty of making an etiologic diagnosis, a set of empiric guidelines has been developed for diagnosis and management of common conditions. Recommendations for the use of antibiotics must take into account the economics, medical manpower, social constraints, and emergence of resistant bacteria in both developed and developing countries. There is a need to establish a coordinated, worldwide network to obtain representative data and to organize clinical trials pertinent to the conditions of both developed and developing countries to define the best antimicrobial agent(s), the dosage, and duration of treatment for specific conditions.\r"

From the outset, controversy focused on scientific research (tropical medicine) vs. public health (tropical health). The former became associated with parasitology to the relative exclusion of microbiology. Remarkable discoveries made before 1912 were followed by sixty years of slow progress. In the last decade, however, not only has parasitic disease research flourished, but the major importance of bacterial and viral diarrheas and respiratory infections has also been revealed. Tropical health did not evolve as a major strategy in the colonial era. Later, a global eradication policy developed, first for hookworm infection, then for yellow fever and malaria, but failure led to disillusionment with technology and development of an undifferentiated approach to primary health care. In the last decade a selective approach has focused on diseases for which cost-effective control measures exist. Moreover, several developing countries have achieved good health at low cost by equitable distribution of health care, education, and food. Today, the conflict between tropical medicine and tropical health is being resolved with the realization that they are truly complementary disciplines.\r"

Although it is the anaerobe most frequently associated with bacteremia and a common isolate in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, wounds, and abscesses, B. fragilis is a rare cause of septic arthritis. The isolation of this organism from four patients with septic arthritis in three Cleveland hospitals between 1978 and 1982 suggests that septic arthritis due to B. fragilis may be a more common clinical entity than previously appreciated. In this report we describe these cases and review the pertinent literature.\r"

GM-CSF induces differentiation of granulocyte, macrophage, and eosinophil precursor cells. Proliferation of monocyte-macrophages, T lymphocytes, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells is also stimulated by GM-CSF. In addition, GM-CSF alters the functional properties of mature granulocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, and basophils. GM-CSF is produced by T lymphocytes, macrophages, and several cell types in extramedullary sites, where it may act in a paracrine manner to regulate the local response to antigenic challenge. Clinical trials of GM-CSF have been conducted in patients with AIDS, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and sarcoma and following bone marrow transplantation and accidental radiation exposure. GM-CSF significantly increased circulating numbers of several myeloid cells and produced dose-dependent toxicity consisting primarily of myalgias, fever, fluid retention, and serosal effusions. Additional studies are needed to define the role of GM-CSF in treatment of patients with qualitative and quantitative dysfunction of immune cells.\r"

More complete clinical and epidemiologic data on cases became available after 1965, when trichinosis was officially made a notifiable disease. The numbers of reported cases declined markedly from an average of approximately 400, with 10-15 deaths reported each year in the late 1940s, to 57 per year, with three deaths in the 5 years 1982-1986. Although annual incidence was highest in sparsely populated Alaska, the highest numbers of cases are reported from the northeastern United States. Food sources of this infection vary in different geographic regions. The decline in annual incidence during the past 12 years appears to be accounted for largely by a decline in the number of cases attributed to commercially purchased pork, although pork products continue to be the major source of infections in humans. The number of cases due to ingestion of wild animal meat have remained relatively constant. Activities at the national and state level that have improved the prospects for control and prevention of trichinosis in commercial products are discussed.\r"

The same level of haemodilution was established during CPB in the two groups. Clinical variables and laboratory data were monitored. Spontaneous kallikrein activity, plasma prekallikrein, functional kallikrein inhibition capacity, spontaneous plasmin activity, plasminogen, functional antiplasmin activity, prothrombin and antithrombin-III were measured, using chromogenic peptide substrate assays before and during CPB as well as in the postoperative period. The antiplasmin activity decreased more in the dextran than in the Ringer group following cardiopulmonary bypass but the difference was without clinical significance. No statistically significant intergroup difference was found in the other measured variables of the kallikrein-kinin, fibrinolytic and coagulation systems.\r"

Moreover, in situ hybridization demonstrated ET messenger RNA in porcine paraventricular nuclear neurons. Endothelin-like immunoreactive products in the posterior pituitary of the rat were depleted by water deprivation, suggesting a release of ET under physiological conditions.

Now it is reported that cultured hippocampal astrocytes can respond to glutamate with a prompt and oscillatory elevation of cytoplasmic free calcium, visible through use of the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3. Two types of glutamate receptor--one preferring quisqualate and releasing calcium from intracellular stores and the other preferring kainate and promoting surface-membrane calcium influx--appear to be involved. Moreover, glutamate-induced increases in cytoplasmic free calcium frequently propagate as waves within the cytoplasm of individual astrocytes and between adjacent astrocytes in confluent cultures. These propagating waves of calcium suggest that networks of astrocytes may constitute a long-range signaling system within the brain.\r"

  ".W": "Transcription of a typical eukaryotic gene by RNA polymerase II is activated by proteins bound to sites found near the beginning of the gene as well as to sites, called enhancers, located a great distance from the gene. According to one view, the primary difference between an activator that can work at a large distance and one that cannot is that the former bears a particularly strong activating region; the stronger the activating region, the more readily the activator interacts with its target bound near the transcriptional start site, with the intervening DNA looping out to accommodate the reaction. One alternative view is that the effect of proteins bound to enhancers might require some special aspect of cellular or chromosome structure. Consistent with the first view, an activator bearing an unusually potent activating region can stimulate transcription of a mammalian gene in a HeLa nuclear extract when bound as far as 1.3 kilobase pairs upstream or 320 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site.\r"

  ".U": "90140805\r", 
  ".W": "In 1981, we reported a series of 75 major hepatic resections done over a ten-year period; 58 were for hepatic trauma, nine were for benign disease, and eight were for malignant disease. Since that report, the indications for major hepatic resection have changed, with a more conservative approach to hepatic trauma and a more aggressive approach toward hepatic tumors. In this update, we report 88 hepatic resections from Vanderbilt University Hospital and Metropolitan Nashville General Hospital; 32 were for trauma, 25 were for benign disorders, and 31 were for malignant disease. Since 1977, nine adults and four children have had hepatic resection for primary malignant tumors; there were six hepatocellular lesions, three hepatoblastomas, two malignant hemangioendotheliomas, one malignant hepatoma, and one intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. At the time of this writing, the four children have survived for 7.3, 6, 6, and 3.8 years (mean 5.7), and all are alive without evidence of recurrence. For the nine adults, survival has averaged 1.7 years, excluding one postoperative death. Three adult patients are alive at this writing, one of whom is a five-year survivor without evidence of disease. Seventeen adults and one child had hepatic resection for metastatic lesions. In the adults, the primary tumor was in the colon in 14 cases and in the small bowel, stomach, and an unknown site in one case each. The one child had a metastatic Wilms' tumor. Survival has averaged two years, with two long-term survivors (nine years). Six patients are alive at this time. Operative mortality for elective resection has decreased from 12% (2/17) in our earlier report to 3% (1/31) in this series, which has encouraged us to assume a more aggressive approach to the resection of malignant primary and metastatic liver tumors.\r"

Catheterization, angiography, and echocardiography all play some important role in the antemortem diagnosis of this cardiac tumor. The treatment of choice is simple complete excision. In this review, we add our experience with cardiac hemangiomas: one incidentally discovered at autopsy and another found during coronary artery bypass surgery.\r"

The results are based on negative (106) as well as positive (125) findings at the 231 disc sites (level and side) explored. Computed tomography-discography (disco-CT) was the most accurate test (87%) compared to 77% for CT-myelography (myelo-CT), 74% for CT, 70% for myelography, 64% for disc injection pain, and 58% for discography. The false positive rate was lower for disco-CT (19%) than for myelo-CT (24%), CT (24%), and myelography (30%). The false negative rate was also lower for disco-CT (8%) than for myelo-CT (22%), CT (29%), and myelography (30%). Disco-CT was the most accurate test (94%) in patients who had prior disc surgery compared with 81% for myelo-CT, 80% for CT, and 74% for myelography. Disco-CT was also the most accurate test for patients with foraminal HNP (91% compared with 71% for CT, 65% for myelo-CT, and 58% for myelography). Disc injection reproduced the patient's clinical pain pattern in only 36% of herniated discs. This test has high specificity (89%), but low sensitivity (43%). The risks from myelography followed by discography within a 72-hour period are similar to those reported for myelography alone. Disco-CT is the most accurate of these tests (P less than 0.05) for the diagnosis of lumbar HNP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy of computed tomography (CT), myelography, CT-myelography (myelo-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) is compared prospectively in 59 patients, all of whom underwent surgical exploration. All tests were read independently of each other and the level of confidence in each diagnosis was recorded. The results are based on the negative (61) as well as positive (59) findings at the 120 disc sites (level and side) explored. Magnetic resonance imaging was the most accurate test (76.5%) compared with myelo-CT (76.0%), CT (73.6%), and myelography (71.4%). The false positive rate was lowest for MRI (13.5%) followed by myelography (13.7%), CT (13.8%), and myelo-CT (21.1%). The false negative rate was lowest for myelo-CT (27.2%) followed by MRI (35.7%), CT (40.2%), and myelography (44.1%). In that subset of 19 patients who had prior surgery, myelography was the most accurate means of diagnosing lumbar HNP (88.8%), followed by MRI (83.3%), myelo-CT (78.4%), and CT (72.6%). The false positive rates in these patients were 11.6% for myelography, 13.2% for MRI, 14.5% for CT, and 16.4% for myelo-CT; the false negative rates were 22.7% for MRI, 24.4% for myelography, 29.5% for myelo-CT, and 47.7% for CT. Magnetic resonance imaging compares very favorably with other currently available imaging modalities for diagnosing lumbar HNP. Magnetic resonance imaging is painless, has no known side effects or morbidity, no radiation exposure, and is noninvasive. The authors recommend it as the procedure of choice for the diagnosis of most lumbar disc herniations.\r"

Although not all intracystic lesions can be differentiated from gross cysts, there are several helpful roentgenologic and clinical clues. The tumor presents mammographically as a sharply circumscribed cystic mass with an irregular and sometimes nodular contour, except where tumor breaks through the wall of the cyst to invade the parenchyma. There the borders become shaggy. This tumor should be suspected clinically if a cystic lesion is seen in a postmenopausal woman not taking estrogens. Management depends on a high degree of suspicion, and a sonogram is useful to visualize the papillary fronds in the cysts. Although malignant papillary lesions are often large on presentation, they carry an excellent prognosis that is not related to their size. Treatment consists of either mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiation, with or without dissection of axillary nodes.\r"

Three infants with cervical teratomas, one infant with an oral-pharyngeal teratoma and one with a combined cervical and oral-pharyngeal teratoma were born in Phoenix over a one year period of time, and all had airway obstruction. These five patients demonstrated the value of prenatal planning and prompt postnatal surgical care by an ultrasonographer, a perinatologist, a neonatologist, maternal and pediatric anesthesiologists and a pediatric surgeon.\r"

Cefmetazole (CM) is a new broad spectrum parenteral cephamycin antibiotic. This drug possesses a spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria that is similar to cefoxitin (CX), an antibiotic widely used for prophylaxis with operations upon the abdomen. In this study, there was a random selection of two patients to receive CM to every one patient to receive CX. The dose of CM was 1 gram given intravenously every eight hours for three doses beginning 30 minutes before the operation; three doses of CX were given intravenously, 2 grams every six hours. Fifty-two evaluable patients comprised the CM group and 26, the CX group. The risk factors for postoperative infection were acute cholecystitis (CM, seven patients; CX, one patient), evidence from imaging procedure suggesting need for exploration of the common duct (CM, six; CX, one), hyperbilirubinemia (CM, eight; CX, four), hyperamylasemia (CM, 17; CX, seven); age of 60 years or more (CM, six; CX, one), obesity (CM, 36; CX, 14) and diabetes mellitus (CM, four; CX, five). Operative bactibilia and the organisms were comparable in both groups. Postoperative days of fever greater than or equal to 38 degrees C. (oral) (CM, 0.83 +/- 1.20; CX, 0.58 +/- 0.96) and hospitalization (CM, 6.59 +/- 2.20; CX, 5.04 +/- 1.26) were similar. Postoperative septic complications at the operative site occurred in two patients in the CM group (4 per cent) and in none of the patients in the CX group (p = 0.4; N.S., Fischer exact test). These two antibiotics had similar efficiency in preventing postoperative infections.\r"

Long term survival depends on rapid institution of an established protocol of surgical management for variceal hemorrhage. A patient who presents with variceal bleeding must be rapidly stabilized with fluid resuscitation, and specific measures, such as the use of vasopressin and balloon tamponade, must be instituted to control hemorrhage so that endoscopy can be used to establish the diagnosis. Sclerotherapy achieves a high rate of success in the acute situation, but if hemorrhage cannot be controlled, percutaneous transhepatic embolization or emergent shunting must be performed, depending on the condition of the patient. Angiography, prior to surgical treatment, is necessary to define venous anatomy and determine portal hemodynamics, both of which provide information vital in choosing the type of shunt. If bleeding is massive and the patient is unstable, H-grafts are most appropriate, for they are technically easier and give excellent short term results. In a stable Child's A or B patient with minor ascites as well as suitable anatomy and hepatopedal flow, DSRS is the procedure of choice because it produces the smallest degree of HE postoperatively and increases the survival rate for nonalcoholics. If this is not feasible or if the surgeon lacks the technical expertise to perform DSRS, PCS is the logical alternative. In view of the data from the series observed in the United States, ablative procedures cannot be recommended at the present for the treatment of variceal bleeding. In the Child's C poor-risk patient, the operative mortality rate is prohibitive, and only nonsurgical means should be used to establish control of bleeding. In the elective situation, the surgical options change. The efficacy of ES as a definitive procedure to control recurrent variceal bleeding is unproved, and rebleeding can be significant; therefore, it cannot be recommended. H-grafts have a prohibitively high rate of long term thrombosis and are also not recommended, and the Linton or proximal splenorenal shunt offers no advantages over conventional portacaval shunting. Moreover, arterialization of the hepatic stumps of the portal vein does not prevent hepatic encephalopathy or alter the survival rate. Both PCS and DSRS prevent rebleeding, yet neither alters the survival rate for alcoholic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These computed tomography scan findings were thought to be characteristic for cerebral sparganosis mansoni and were difficult to differentiate from those of a cerebral tumor. In both cases, definitive diagnosis was achieved by identification of the worm after excision of the lesion. The best treatment for cerebral sparganosis mansoni is surgical excision of the lesion, and in the two cases presented the postoperative outcome was good.\r"

The original name, \"superior oblique tendon sheath syndrome,\" is no longer appropriate, since it has been shown that the tissue surrounding the anterior superior oblique tendon is blameless as a restrictive force. \"True\" and \"simulated\" as descriptive modifiers should also be discarded, as they relate to the disproven sheath concept. Brown's syndrome occurs as a congenital or acquired, constant or intermittent condition; the common link is restriction of free movement through the trochlea pulley mechanism. The various etiologic theories are reviewed and the spectrum of medical and surgical treatments are described and evaluated. Evidence suggests that subtypes of Brown's syndrome lie on a single continuum and that spontaneous resolution occurs in each group, probably more often than previously recognized. A simplified classification scheme is encouraged and possible future directions in Brown's syndrome research are introduced.\r"

Alveolar surface tension was elevated by inhalation of 15 mg/kg of the aerosolized detergent dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (OT). Hemodynamic measurements, blood gases, and colloid oncotic pressures were recorded in anesthesized dogs for 2 hours after surfactant displacement and elevation of PEEP to 10 cm H2O pressure (group II; n = 10). These data were compared with those of an identical protocol that used only 5 cm H2O PEEP (group I; n = 10). Pulmonary extravascular water volume (PEWV) was measured gravimetrically at the end of the experiment. OT inhalation resulted in an immediate fall in Pao2 and rise in venous admixture (QVa/QT), with little change in colloid oncotic pressure or left atrial pressure. In group I, Pao2 and QVa/QT did not improve significantly over 2 hours, whereas both returned to near baseline in group II. PEWV was elevated in group I compared with normal PEWV (historic controls; n = 11) (6.1 +/- 0.07 - 3.6 +/- 0.01 ml/gm dry lung; p less than 0.01); however, PEWV in group II (9.1 +/- 1.0 ml/gm dry lung; p less than 0.01) was greater than in both group I and historic controls. These data indicate that high alveolar surface tension induces pulmonary edema and PEEP accelerates this edema formation.\r"

These metabolic changes have been attributed to the presence of inflammatory cells in injured tissues. To correlate these metabolic changes with changes in the inflammatory cell population at various times after injury, we studied the lambda-carrageenan hindlimb wound model in anesthetized rats. Perfusion studies demonstrated that at 3 and 5 days after injury glucose uptake was increased in injured hindlimbs, compared with hindlimbs from pair-fed control animals. At 3, 5, and 10 days after injury, lactate production from glucose was increased in injured hindlimbs, compared with hindlimbs from pair-fed control animals. These metabolic changes were not related to differences in body weight or food intake. There was no difference in glucose oxidation or in oxygen consumption in injured hindlimbs, compared with hindlimbs from pair-fed control animals. The increased glucose uptake and increased lactate production from glucose was coincident with the presence of inflammatory cells--predominantly macrophages--at the site of injury. It is suggested that the glucose metabolism in injured tissue reflects the metabolism of the inflammatory cells at the site of injury.\r"

In wounds sutured without tension, no decrease in breaking strength was observed at 72 hours; in rats sutured with tension, breaking strength decreased by 77%, and in almost half of the animals the sutures cut through. There was markedly increased accumulation of neutrophil leukocytes around the sutures in the tension group, as indicated by increased tissue myeloperoxidase activity. The decrease in breaking strength was abolished by treatment with an inhibitor of the collagen-degrading proteinases of the neutrophils (the soybean trypsin inhibitor). Although the decrease in breaking strength should be due to collagenolysis, there were no changes in collagen content or solubility around the sutures, indicating that the changes in collagen were too delicate to be revealed by the methods used. We conclude that the decrease in breaking strength was caused by the neutrophils.\r"

  ".U": "90141432\r", 
  ".W": "Inhalation of sodium metabisulphite is thought to induce bronchoconstriction by release of sulphur dioxide. We sought to establish the reproducibility of the airway response to inhaled sodium metabisulphite given in increasing doubling concentrations (0.3 to 160 mg/ml) to 13 asthmatic and five atopic non-asthmatic subjects and the contribution of cholinergic mechanisms to this response. In 15 of the 18 subjects bronchoconstriction was sufficient to allow calculation of the dose of metabisulphite causing a 20% reduction in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) from baseline values (PD20 metabisulphite). The 95% confidence limit for the difference between this and a second PD20 metabisulphite determined 2-14 days later was 2.5 doubling doses. The difference between repeat PD20 metabisulphite measurements was unrelated to the number of days between challenges or change in baseline FEV1. Ten subjects returned for a third study 3-120 days after the second challenge; variability in PD20 metabisulphite did not differ from that seen between the first and second challenges. PD20 methacholine was determined between the two metabisulphite challenges and found to correlate with PD20 metabisulphite (r = 0.71). Inhaled ipratropium bromide 200 micrograms given in a randomised, placebo controlled, crossover study to 10 subjects increased PD20 methacholine 42 fold but had no significant effect on the response to metabisulphite. A single inhalation of the PD20 metabisulphite in five subjects induced maximal bronchoconstriction 2-3 minutes after inhalation, with a plateau in FEV1 lasting a further four minutes before recovery. A further single inhalation of the same PD20 dose 43 minutes later produced a 27% (SEM 4%) smaller fall in FEV1 than the first inhalation. These results show that metabisulphite PD20 values measured over days and weeks show similar reproducibility to those reported for histamine inhalation and that PD20 metabisulphite correlates with methacholine responsiveness. Most of the bronchoconstriction is not inhibited by antimuscarinic agents; the underlying mechanisms require further investigation.\r"

Methacholine provocations were carried out on three days before and after increasing doses of theophylline, enprofylline, and placebo, a double blind study design being used. Methacholine responsiveness was determined as the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a fall of 20% in FEV1 (PC20). The patients were characterised pharmacokinetically before the main study to provide an individual dosage scheme for each patient that would provide rapid steady state plasma concentration plateaus of 5, 10, and 15 mg/l for theophylline and 1.25, 2.5, and 3.75 mg/l for enprofylline. Dose increments in the main study were given at 90 minute intervals. FEV1 showed a small progressive decrease after placebo; it remained high in relation to placebo after both drugs and this effect was dose related. Methacholine PC20 values decreased after placebo; mean values were higher after theophylline and enprofylline than after placebo (maximum difference 2.0 and 1.7 doubling doses of methacholine); the effect of both drugs were dose related. Thus enprofylline and theophylline when given intravenously cause a small dose related increase in FEV1 and methacholine PC20 when compared with placebo.\r"

  ".W": "Current evidence indicates that the length of survival for patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is increasing, thereby affording a greater opportunity for strategies designed to prevent the infectious diseases that mark the syndrome. Because these infections may occur at different stages of immunosuppression caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), effective application of preventive measures depends not only on detection of HIV infection but also on the use of staging indicators. The diseases that serve to define AIDS, such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, tend to occur late in the course of HIV infection and often when the T helper lymphocyte (CD4+ cells) count is less than 0.2 x 10(9)/l. Other infections, such as tuberculosis and pyogenic bacterial pneumonia, may develop at any point after HIV infection has occurred. Given this relation between the degree of immunosuppression and the occurrence of particular pulmonary infections, different preventive interventions should be applied at different times. It is now known that the incidence of several of the pulmonary infections that are common in patients with HIV infection can be reduced by prophylactic measures. Pneumocystis pneumonia is decreased in frequency by any one of several prophylactic agents, the best established being pentamidine administered as an inhaled aerosol. The role of isoniazid in the chemoprophylaxis of tuberculosis in patients not infected with HIV is well established. Although there is little evidence of benefit so far from isoniazid in HIV infected patients with a positive tuberculin skin test response, it is logical to assume that there could be some effect. The use of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine may also be of some benefit in reducing the frequency of pneumococcal pneumonia in patients with AIDS. In addition to these specific measures, the antiretroviral agent zidovudine decreases both the frequency and the severity of opportunist infections, at least during the first few months of treatment. A comprehensive strategy for prevention of HIV associated lung infection first requires detection of HIV seropositivity, staging the immunosuppression by the CD4+ cell count, and determining whether tuberculous infection is present by a tuberculin skin test. All seropositive individuals should be given pneumococcal vaccine and those with evidence of tuberculosis infection should be treated with isoniazid for one year. Zidovudine should probably be started when CD4+ cell counts are in the range 0.4-0.5 x 10(9)/l and prophylaxis against pneumocystis infection when CD4+ cell counts are in the range 0.2-0.3 x 10(9)/l.\r"

Chronic atrial fibrillation carries an annual 3-6% risk of thromboembolic complications, which is 5-7 times greater than that of controls with sinus rhythm. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is associated with a lower risk of thromboembolic complications than chronic atrial fibrillation. Heart failure and systemic hypertension seem to be significant clinical risk factors for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but disagreement persists, and, with few exceptions, subgroups at particular risk have not been convincingly identified. The risk of stroke in persons with thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation seems to be lower than believed previously. Clinical studies have shown that left atrial dilatation is a consequence of the duration of atrial fibrillation rather than a cause, but the relation of left atrial enlargement to stroke is uncertain. Cerebral blood flow may be reduced during atrial fibrillation but seems to increase after cardioversion to sinus rhythm. A high prevalence of silent cerebral infarction has been detected in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, but there seems to be a low risk of silent cerebral infarction in persons with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The one prospective study published to date on stroke prevention in patients with nonrheumatic chronic atrial fibrillation showed that anticoagulation with warfarin significantly reduced the incidence of thromboembolic complications.\r"

A review of the published comparative studies and abstracts indicates that, overall, oral fluoroquinolones were at least as effective as, and certainly less expensive than, the parenteral agents studied. However, the spectrum of infection types and the number of patients studied in comparative trials have been small. In addition, ofloxacin and enoxacin were underrepresented in the study material. Oral fluoroquinolones were devoid of the serious adverse effects associated with the aminoglycosides, vancomycin, and the methylthiotetrazole-containing cephalosporins. In general, the incidence of minor adverse effects were similar for the oral fluoroquinolones and comparison parenteral regimens. Meta-analysis of the published reports and abstracts revealed that the oral fluoroquinolones are as effective as parenteral mono- or combination regimens for the treatment of serious bacterial infections in selected patient populations.\r"

  ".U": "90142936\r", 
  ".W": "Oral cephalosporins, after 25 years of use, continue to present the clinician with a therapeutic challenge. The older agents have been extensively prescribed for ambulatory adult and pediatric patients with a wide variety of infections caused by gram-positive and some gram-negative organisms. The newer agents, cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, and cefixime, have increased in vitro activity against beta-lactamase-secreting strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis which has made them more popular for the treatment of otitis media and respiratory tract infections in children. The new agents are also more active against most gram-negative organisms. However, clinical trials have failed to show a clear-cut superiority over older, proven therapy when used to treat infections of the respiratory tract, middle ear, skin and soft tissue, urinary tract, and bone and joints when caused by sensitive organisms. Published reports of clinical trials continue to support the recommendation that oral cephalosporins, especially the newer and more expensive agents, be reserved for second- or third-line therapy when amoxicillin, penicillin V, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole have either failed or produced patient intolerance. Erythromycin/sulfisoxazole and amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium are equally efficacious and also less expensive than cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, and cefixime and could be considered second-line therapy prior to the use of the newer cephalosporins for infections in the ambulatory patient.\r"

  ".W": "Infections in humans are most often caused by aerobic microorganisms colonizing the digestive tract. Aerobic microorganisms are constantly entering the digestive tract with food, but colonization is resisted by autochthonous anaerobic flora (microbial colonization resistance) and by host-related factors (physiologic colonization resistance). Antibiotics to which the autochthonous anaerobic flora are sensitive and that achieve sufficiently high concentrations at the sites of colonization will reduce colonization resistance. Consequently, resistant aerobic flora of the digestive tract may reach high concentrations, increasing the risk of superinfection. Therefore, when choosing antimicrobial agents for therapy, the effect on colonization resistance should be taken into account. Immunosuppressed hosts and acutely ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation can be protected from serious infections by eliminating the most dangerous species of the aerobic endogenous flora, leaving colonization resistance intact. This is called selective decolonization. This article summarizes the effects of antimicrobial agents on colonization resistance.\r"

  ".W": "The principal goal of dietary prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease is the achievement of physiological levels of the plasma total and LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, and VLDL. These goals have been well delineated by the National Cholesterol Education Program of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the American Heart Association. Dietary treatment is first accomplished by enhancing LDL receptor activity and at the same time depressing liver synthesis of cholesterol and triglyceride. Both dietary cholesterol and saturated fat decrease LDL receptor activity and inhibit the removal of LDL from the plasma by the liver. Saturated fat decreases LDL receptor activity, especially when cholesterol is concurrently present in the diet. The total amount of dietary fat is of importance also. The greater the flux of chylomicron remnants is into the liver, the greater is the influx of cholesterol ester. In addition, factors that affect VLDL and LDL synthesis could be important. These include excessive calories (obesity), which enhance triglyceride and VLDL and hence LDL synthesis. Weight loss and omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil depress synthesis of both VLDL and triglyceride in the liver. The optimal diet for the treatment of children and adults to prevent coronary disease has the following characteristics: cholesterol (100 mg/day), total fat (20% of calories, 6% saturated with the balance from omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat), carbohydrate (65% of calories, two thirds from starch including 11 to 15 gm of soluble fiber), and protein (15% of calories). This low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet can lower the plasma cholesterol 18% to 21%. This diet is also an antithrombotic diet, thrombosis being another major consideration in preventing coronary heart disease. Dietary therapy is the mainstay of the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease through the control of plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. The exact place of the omega-3 fatty acids from fish and fish oil remains to be defined. However, this much seems certain. Fish provides an excellent substitute for meat in the diet. Fish is lower in fat, especially saturated fat, and contains the omega-3 fatty acids. Fish oil may have promise as a therapeutic agent in certain hyperlipidemic states, especially the chylomicronemia of type V hyperlipidemia. Fish oil has logical and well-defined antithrombotic and anti-atherosclerotic activities since it depresses thromboxane A2 production and inhibits cellular proliferation responsible for the progression of atherosclerosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The latter has a normal prognosis in pregnancy, with the possible exception of NANB hepatitis in India and North Africa. Immunization of neonates born of mothers suffering from acute or chronic HBV is essential and effective. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy has a better prognosis than previously thought, perhaps due to diagnosis of milder cases or improved intensive care. Its etiology is still unknown, but metabolic stress may be important. The confusion and overlap of AFLP, the HELLP syndrome, and liver disease of eclampsia suggest common etiological factors. Urgent delivery of the fetus is recommended in AFLP. The related condition of acute liver rupture may be diagnosed by ultrasound. Successful conservative management has been reported. Estrogens are involved in the pathophysiology of ICP, but this does not explain the profound racial differences in incidence. The nature of the sensitivity to estrogens is not understood, although reduced membrane fluidity, which may be counteracted by S-adenosyl-L-methionine, is one possible explanation. The increased fetal loss associated with ICP suggests that treatment should be more energetic than hitherto. In the worst affected individuals, fetal malnutrition secondary to maternal steatorrhea may be an important factor. In general, patients with chronic liver disease have increased maternal and particularly fetal mortality.\r"

It is frequently due to coronary artery disease and/or LV hypertrophy and it is especially common in the older population. Patients with diastolic dysfunction and normal systolic function are best treated with calcium channel blocking agents or beta-blocking agents (drugs that are generally avoided in patients with significant systolic dysfunction). These drugs are used in the same dosage as is used in patients with angina or hypertension. Most treatment is based on symptomatic relief, and therefore periods of cautious trial and error are the rule. When diastolic dysfunction is associated with systolic dysfunction, it may be necessary to treat both conditions, but in general, positive inotropic agents and arterial vasodilators are not useful in patients with diastolic dysfunction.\r"

The small intestinal histological appearance of villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lamina propria, and epithelial cell abnormalities is characteristic but not pathognomonic of the disorder. Confirmation of the diagnosis depends on histological improvement when gluten is removed from the diet and deterioration following gluten reintroduction. The pathogenesis of celiac disease appears to require interaction between a number of factors both intrinsic (genetic susceptibility, activation of the immune system) and extrinsic (gluten susceptibility, activation of the immune system) and extrinsic (gluten and possibly other environmental factors). The diagnosis of GSE may be delayed or missed unless the clinician is aware of the broad clinical spectrum of disease presentation. Although celiac disease is widely perceived as a malabsorption syndrome of childhood, the diagnosis is increasingly being made for the first time in adult life. A significant number of patients have no GI symptoms whatsoever. Small intestinal biopsy through the endoscope is the initial and definitive investigation. Most patients show excellent clinical and histological response to a gluten-free diet. The commonest reason for poor response is continuing intentional or inadvertent gluten intake. A minority of patients develop complications, in particular intestinal malignancy, including enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between preinfarction clinical status and short-term outcome was prospectively evaluated in 775 patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction after reperfusion therapy. It was anticipated that a history of angina preceding myocardial infarction by more than 7 days would be associated with more extensive underlying coronary artery disease and a more complicated in-hospital course. However, although this group did have a higher risk profile for coronary artery disease (hypertension 53.6% vs 37.2%; diabetes 22.5% vs 12.1%; hyperlipidemia 19.4% vs 9.8%; mean number of risk factors 2.2 vs 1.7, p = 0.0001), a higher incidence of multivessel disease (57.7% vs 39.6%, p less than 0.0001), worse baseline global left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction 48.8% vs 51.3%, p = 0.03), and impaired function of the noninfarct zone (-0.05 vs +0.46 SD/chord, p = 0.002), the in-hospital course was less complicated than in the group without prior angina. Patients without antecedent angina had a higher rate of reocclusion of the infarct-related artery (13.6% vs 8.2%; p = 0.048). Although the difference did not reach statistical significance (7.2% vs 4.6%; p = 0.21), the in-hospital mortality rate was also higher in this group. These findings suggest that a history of prior angina is not necessarily associated with an unfavorable short-term prognosis after reperfusion therapy. This may be related to the greater prior use by this group of beta-adrenergic- and calcium channel-blocking agents (23.1% vs 8.5% and 20.7% vs 3.8%, respectively). It may also be related to the beneficial effects of collateral vessels, myocardial preconditioning, or differences in the native fibrinolytic system.\r"

A secondary analysis of these 86 segments revealed that at follow-up angiography the severity of restenosis was greater in the 46 segments in the placebo group than in the 40 segments in the active treatment group (mean minimal luminal diameter at the stenosis = 0.76 +/- 0.52 and 1.03 +/- 0.45 mm, respectively, p = 0.01). The frequency of total or subtotal occlusions was higher in the placebo group (17.4%) than in the active treatment group (5.0%), but this observation did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). Although long-term treatment with aspirin and dipyridamole after successful PTCA does not reduce the incidence of recurrence, this secondary analysis suggests that it is associated with a decreased likelihood of severe restenosis.\r"

In patients receiving both compounds, the effective dosage of adenosine was 3.8 mg and of ATP it was 6.6 mg (p less than 0.05), suggesting molar equipotency. Transient side effects were common, occurring in 81% of episodes with adenosine and in 94% with ATP. Symptom scores (0 to 10) were not significantly different (median score for adenosine was 5, for ATP it was 6). Adenosine and ATP were equally effective for the diagnosis and treatment of supraventricular tachycardias and the incidence and severity of side effects were similar.

Plasma renin activity was determined from blood samples drawn from the aorta and from both renal veins, so that \"ischemic lateralization\" could be evaluated through appropriately derived indexes. Nifedipine promptly and significantly lowered aortic pressure in all patients. At 30 minutes maximal circulatory responses were recorded, which consisted of a 22% decrease in mean aortic pressure (from an average of 144.6 +/- 15 mm Hg to an average of 113 +/- 11 mm Hg), a 44% reduction of systemic vascular resistance (from 2162 +/- 540 dynes.sec.cm-5 to to 1205 +/- 279 dynes.sec.cm-5), a 33% rise in cardiac index (from 2920 +/- 970 ml/min/m2 to 3875 +/- 986 ml/min/m2). These effects were still evident, although somewhat tempered, after 180 minutes of continuous monitoring; they were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those reported by some authors in persons with primary hypertension with similar levels of blood pressure. After nifedipine was given, renin activity of the systemic blood rose significantly, because of a potentiated release from the kidney with arterial stenosis. This effect, which was inferred as being due to further reduction of the renal perfusion pressure, improved the significance of \"ischemic lateralization\" indexes and supported the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in all cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During this time, our knowledge of the mechanisms of angioplasty and of how it relates to the pathophysiology of restenosis has also grown. Despite our better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for it, restenosis remains a significant problem in coronary angioplasty, affecting approximately one third of patients. A variety of factors can affect the measured rate of restenosis, such as the symptomatic status of the patient and the timing of restenosis studies. Certain clinical, anatomic, and procedural factors are associated with increased rates of restenosis. Pharmacologic interventions are ineffective in preventing restenosis. A variety of new mechanical devices are being developed, but their efficacy at this time does not appear to be superior to angioplasty alone. While attempts at preventing restenosis have thus far been unsuccessful, the information gained through the various studies has added tremendously to our knowledge base of angioplasty. Through this better understanding of the mechanisms of angioplasty and restenosis, it is likely that the problem of restenosis will be improved, either through existing technology or by methods yet to be discovered.\r"

  ".W": "The dihydropyridine derivatives constitute a distinct subcategory of calcium channel blockers that have marked peripheral vascular effects with minimal or no electrophysiologic actions when administered to intact animals or humans. These dihydropyridine derivatives are structurally similar to nifedipine, the most widely studied dihydropyridine. The derivatives have varying affinities for different regional circulations, and there may be an important relationship between structure and activity of these compounds with respect to the predilection of the site of their action in vascular tissue. It is possible that such differences may be of clinical significance. As a class, the dihydropyridines exert reasonably distinct hemodynamic changes that may be of particular importance in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac failure, and regurgitant valvular lesions. Nicardipine hydrochloride is a newer agent that has undergone extensive evaluation in recent years. Pharmacologically and electrophysiologically, it resembles other dihydropyridines. Unlike nifedipine, however, it can be administered by both the intravenous and oral routes. There are additional differences between its properties and those of other calcium channel blockers. For example, nicardipine appears to produce a greater increase in coronary sinus blood flow than other calcium channel blockers. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In addition, nicardipine appears to increase myocardial contractility, even in patients with severe congestive cardiac failure. Nicardipine produces a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance with increases in heart rate, left ventricular dP/dt, LV ejection fraction, cardiac output, and stroke work index, but no significant change in LV end-diastolic pressure. Clearly, the drug has negligible venodilator actions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was shown that nicardipine was uniformly effective in lowering blood pressure to a therapeutic goal of 95 mm Hg. Time to achieve therapeutic effect was dose dependent, and steady-state blood levels were achieved after 8 to 12 hours. Reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure but not changes in heart rate were correlated with plasma concentrations of nicardipine. In dose-ranging studies, the minimal effective dose of nicardipine appeared to be 2 mg/hr; 1 mg/hr was an ineffective dose, and little additional effect was seen above 4 mg/hr. Side effects were modest and consisted of those associated with vasodilation--headache, flushing, and feelings of warmth. In the initial group of patients studied, local thrombophlebitis occurred in a substantial number of patients. This was seen only after 14 hours of infusion. In subsequent studies, the infusion site was changed after 12 hours, and no further cases of thrombophlebitis were seen. Nicardipine appears to be therapeutic agent for parenteral use that shows promise in the treatment of severe hypertension.\r"

Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, may also be used, but because no intravenous preparation is available, its effects are not titratable. A new short-acting calcium channel blocker, nicardipine, is a potent vasodilator and produces more selective responses in the coronary versus the systemic vascular circulation. It is an effective cerebral vasodilator, increasing cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery. Nicardipine can be administered as an intravenous loading infusion of 10 to 15 mg/hr for 25 minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion of 3 to 5 mg/hr. Nicardipine has a short duration factor, is easily titratable and is as effective as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside in the control of hypertension. In summary, nicardipine has many properties of an ideal drug for the treatment of postoperative hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of new drugs for the treatment of patients with heart failure requires assessment of the inotropic effects of these agents. Use of traditional indexes of contractility has been limited by the confounding effects of load on these measures of contractile function, although they have yielded meaningful conclusions in some studies. Recently, the end-systolic pressure volume relation (ESPVR) has emerged as a relatively load-independent measure of contractility. Because it is difficult to construct the relation in the clinical setting, several approximations have been introduced, some of which have significant limitations. We have applied the ESPVR to the assessment of the inotropic effect of the new dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, nicardipine, in 15 patients with heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction. We constructed left ventricular pressure-volume loops from micromanometer pressure and radionuclide volume and manipulated afterload with nitroprusside. In response to intravenous nicardipine, mean arterial pressure fell from 91 +/- 4 (mean +/- SEM) to 72 +/- 2 mm Hg, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 27 +/- 2 to 23 +/- 3 mm Hg, cardiac index increased from 1.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.4 +/- 0.1 L/min/m2, and left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 0.15 +/- 0.01 to 0.19 +/- 0.01 (all p less than 0.05). Heart rate did not change. A rightward shift of the ESPVR, indicating a negative inotropic effect of nicardipine, was observed in 12 of 14 patients (p less than 0.05). We conclude that nicardipine improves left ventricular pump performance despite its negative inotropic effect in patients with severe heart failure. The improvement in pump performance can be attributed to afterload reduction.\r"

The present study was a prospective randomized trial designed to evaluate the relative incidence of dizziness, flushing, headache, pedal edema, and palpitations during use of these drugs in patients with angina pectoris. Of 250 patients who entered into the comparative treatment part of the study, 140 patients were susceptible to developing symptoms to nifedipine as identified during a 1-month open-label treatment with nifedipine. These patients were compared with a parallel cohort of 110 patients, who were identified during the same open-label period, but remained mostly asymptomatic. After a 1-week washout of nifedipine, equal numbers of patients in each cohort began an 8-week period of randomized, double-blind treatment with nifedipine (20 mg three times daily) or nicardipine (30 mg three times daily). Patients who experienced these symptoms during the open-label nifedipine treatment had a higher incidence of the same symptoms during the blinded treatment regimen. Nicardipine-treated patients had a lower incidence of each of the symptoms than did the nifedipine-treated patients. Statistically significant differences were reported for dizziness, the most common of the side effects. Patients who were free of these symptoms in the open-label period usually remained free of them in the blinded comparison. However, even among those free of dizziness during the open-label nifedipine treatment, more patients reported experiencing dizziness in the blinded phase from nifedipine than from nicardipine (18% vs 6%; p = 0.02).\r"

Cigarette smokers (n = 2,332) were 5 years younger than nonsmokers and had a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension, previous AMI and cardiomegaly. Among cigarette smokers, the placebo group had a higher total mortality rate than the propranolol group (11.0 vs 7.4%, p less than 0.0008) and more sudden cardiac deaths (7.1 vs 4.6%, p less than 0.009). In nonsmokers the placebo group had a mortality (7.9 vs 7.1%, p greater than 0.64) similar to the propranolol group. After baseline adjustment, cigarette smokers were estimated to have 1.6 times the risk of dying as compared to nonsmokers (p less than 0.0007). Adjusting for baseline differences, both treatment with propranolol and nonsmoking were predictors of survival. No detectable nonsmoking/propranolol interaction could be identified. In survivors of AMI a beneficial effect of propranolol is observed for cigarette smokers. Nevertheless, cigarette smoking continues to be a risk factor for mortality after AMI even for those receiving propranolol.\r"

Using this method TNF positivity was demonstrated in 57 of 65 (88%) of tissue sections classified as atherosclerotic and in 5 of 11 (45%) sections classified as minimally atherosclerotic. TNF was absent in 6 sections classified as normal. TNF positivity was found not only in the cytoplasm of macrophages, but also in the cytoplasm and attached to the cell membrane of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of the human atheroma. Because TNF is known to cause new vessel formation, hemorrhagic necrosis and increased thrombogenicity, it may play a role in the evolution of uncomplicated to complex atheroma.\r"

Mean pretreatment intraarterial BP at rest sitting was 177/107 mm Hg. The patients were randomly allocated to lisinopril combined with either low salt diet (low salt group, n = 13) or hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic group, n = 12). After 1 year of treatment the mean dose of lisinopril was 25 mg in both groups. In the low salt group sodium excretion was reduced from 188 to 129 mmol/24 hours (p less than 0.01). In the diuretic group sodium excretion was unchanged with a mean dose of hydrochlorothiazide of 19 mg. BP was reduced (p less than 0.001) in both groups: at rest 16 and 21% and during exercise 10 and 13% in the low salt and the diuretic groups, respectively. Total peripheral resistance was reduced (p less than 0.05) in both groups: at rest 14 and 7% and during exercise 8 and 5% in the low salt and the diuretic groups, respectively. Overall cardiac output was reduced (p less than 0.05) in the diuretic group but remained unchanged in the low salt group. Thus, lisinopril--either in combination with a diuretic or sodium restriction--induces marked reduction in BP due to decreases in peripheral vascular resistance both at rest and during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Survival of patients with acute transmural infarction is largely related to the size of the myocardial infarction. The goal of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction is maximal salvage of myocardium by reestablishment of flow in the occluded infarct-related artery and the establishment and maintenance of a patent infarct-related artery. Results of randomized trials show a significant reduction in mortality in patients who have undergone thrombolysis. A patent infarct-related artery, even in the absence of a change in left ventricular function, is associated with reduced mortality. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Trial and the European Cooperative Trial showed that recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator is superior to streptokinase in reestablishing flow in a totally occluded artery. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that thrombolysis and thrombosis occur simultaneously, and that lysis appears to increase both thrombin and platelet activity. Effective reduction of thrombosis accelerates thrombolysis. Rethrombosis after thrombolysis is due to anchored residual thrombus, which alters the hemorrheology of blood flow and produces a highly thrombogenic substrate that is largely due to residual fibrin-bound thrombin. Platelet deposition is directly related to severity of residual stenosis and shear rate. Thrombin appears to be the most potent of the 5 potential stimulators of platelet activation during arterial thrombosis. Proper anticoagulation can play an important role in reducing thrombosis. Experimental evidence strongly supports the use of heparin during and after thrombolysis. A recently reported study shows continued reduction of residual stenosis after 1 month of vigorous anticoagulation with intravenous heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Now more evidence, including the results of a 10-day in-hospital study of low- and high-dose calcium heparin, has been gathered to support using anticoagulants for these patients. The study used the development of left ventricular mural thrombosis, a frequent complication of acute myocardial infarction that carries a high risk for systemic embolic complications, to assess clinical outcome: A reduced incidence of mural thrombosis would be taken to indicate reduced chances that patients would have major systemic emboli. Two-dimensional echocardiography was used to detect thrombi. In the study, the incidence of left ventricular mural thrombosis was significantly lower in the high--than in the low-dose group. Among patients in the high-dose group in whom a mural thrombosis did develop, plasma heparin concentrations were significantly lower and activated partial thromboplastin times were shorter. These data suggest that monitoring plasma heparin levels and anticoagulant response can ensure maximal treatment effectiveness. No significant differences in other outcomes--such as bleeding complications, nonhemorrhagic strokes and mortality--were found between the high- and low-dose treatment groups.\r"

Knowing how strokes occur and what precipitates them--e.g., differentiating between cardioembolic and cerebrovascular causes--is important when deciding on appropriate treatment. Risk factors involved in the development of thromboembolic complications associated with AF are reviewed, focusing on the contributions of thyrotoxic AF, paroxysmal AF (and its transition to chronic AF), enlargement of the left atrium, silent cerebral infarction and decreased cerebral blood flow. Data from several studies are briefly presented, highlighting major outcomes. On the basis of current information about prevention of thromboembolic complications, it seems reasonable to recommend anticoagulant treatment for patients with nonrheumatic chronic AF.\r"

Determining the cause of ischemic stroke is often difficult because multiple potential etiologies are often present and available diagnostic tools are relatively insensitive. The diagnosis of cardioembolic stroke is based on a variety of clinical and laboratory clues that are significant, although not invariable, predictors of stroke etiology. Computed tomography scans help suggest etiology, and scans performed at 48 hours after stroke onset are essential to identify hemorrhagic infarctions. Cerebral angiograms may be helpful if performed early. Echocardiography is indicated only for selected patients who are more likely to demonstrate cardiac abnormalities on an echocardiogram. The management of acute cardioembolic stroke involves weighing the benefits of reducing stroke recurrence by anticoagulation against the risk of symptomatic brain hemorrhage. A management algorithm is provided that can help reduce both the risk of symptomatic brain hemorrhage and the incidence of potentially disabling stroke recurrence.\r"

Venous thrombosis in itself may be benign, but the condition can lead to dangerous complications and has a high recurrence rate. Strategies to prevent DVT involve prevention of stasis and reversal of changes in blood coagulability that allow thrombi to form. Pharmacologic agents have been effective in reducing the incidence of DVT and pulmonary embolism. Low-dose subcutaneous heparin is considered a nearly ideal DVT preventative for surgically treated patients. The risk of hemorrhage is the main limitation to routine use of subcutaneous anticoagulants for DVT, but careful patient selection can minimize that risk. After anticoagulant therapy with heparin, generally for 7 to 10 days, oral warfarin is the drug of choice for maintenance anticoagulation to prevent DVT recurrence. Therapy for pulmonary embolism is the same as for DVT--immediate anticoagulation with heparin followed by maintenance with warfarin.\r"

  ".W": "The thrombotic component in ischemic heart disease (IHD) is now universally recognized. It is therefore logical to consider modifying both fibrin formation and platelet function in primary (as well as secondary) prevention. The scientific case for evaluating lower-dose warfarin in primary prevention rests on the implications of the secondary prevention trials, increasing evidence of an association between the level of factor VII coagulant activity, VIIc, and the incidence of IHD, and the results of short-term lower-dose trials for the prevention of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism. The general case for considering aspirin in primary prevention is well known, but the potential value of low-dose aspirin in men at high risk needs to be established. Currently available evidence suggests that the combination of lower doses of both warfarin and aspirin in primary prevention may be effective and safe. The objective of the factorial Thrombosis Prevention Trial is to demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of IHD in men at high risk attributable to low-dose warfarin or low-dose aspirin, or both, with 1 group receiving both active treatments. The feasibility of this trial has been demonstrated. An International Normalized Ratio of about 1.5, achieved with an average daily dose of 4.6 mg warfarin, has resulted in no increase in the number of men ever reporting minor bleeding episodes, although rectal bleeding occurs more frequently in those men who do report this symptom.\r"

The ICAM-1 and HLA-DR molecules were both strongly expressed in the lymphoid and endothelial cells. ICAM-1 expression was uniform in the epithelium, whereas the HLA-DR molecules were preferentially expressed in the epithelial cells in the basalis. Expression of both epithelial HLA-DR and ICAM-1 molecules was enhanced adjacent to lymphoid aggregates. ICAM-1 molecule was uniformly expressed in the stromal cells in the basalis and the functionalis, whereas the HLA-DR molecules were expressed exclusively in the stromal cells surrounding the lymphoid cells. ICAM-1 expression in the epithelial and stromal cells was confirmed in the isolated intact stromal cells and glands by immunohistochemistry. Although stromal and epithelial cells propagated in vitro expressed ICAM-1, they were rarely HLA-DR positive. The expression of LFA-1 was confined to the lymphoid cells. The high level of expression of ICAM-1, LFA-1, and HLA-DR molecules in human endometrial constituents may contribute to the presence, aggregation, and preferential distribution of lymphoid cells in human endometrium.\r"

Histologically, the testes contained peritubular fibrosis and variable spermatogenic arrest, which were inconsistent with the young age of these patients. There were also numerous foci of germ cell degeneration and occasional germ cell loss. The Leydig cells were atrophic and decreased in number. The prostates contained increased numbers of concretions. Sections of testis and prostate were stained with an anti-HIV P17 monoclonal antibody with the use of the avidin-biotin technique. Small scattered foci of positive staining were identified in 8 of 14 testes (57%). They were located over one or several degenerating germ cells and the surrounding Sertoli cells. In addition, in 9 of 14 prostates (64%) there were a few minute foci of positive staining in several adjacent glandular epithelial cells. In one case the testis was positive and the prostate was negative, whereas in two cases the testes were negative and the prostate positive. In contrast, 22 testes and 22 prostates of control non-AIDS patients, read double-blind, were negative. The positive controls were HIV-infected tissue culture HUT 78 lymphoma cells in which there were many scattered positive cells. The results indicate the presence of focal HIV-associated protein in the testes and prostates of patients with AIDS, particularly within the foci of germ cell degeneration. The present observations are in accordance with previous research demonstrating the presence of HIV in the seminal fluid of patients with AIDS and appears to indicate the presence of an infection of the male genital tract by the HIV virus.\r"

In typical seminoma, 75% of the tumor cells in stage I and 30% in stage II were stained. In embryonal cell carcinoma, 25% of the cases in stage I and less than 10% of those in stage II were stained. Mature teratoma was stained in most of the cases, whereas in malignant teratoma only 35% of the cases showed some staining of the tumor cells. In mixed tumors each component displayed its characteristic staining pattern. The expression of class I antigens on tumor cells is required for immune recognition and lysis of the tumor by cytotoxic T-cells. The reduced expression of class I antigens that was related to histologic characteristics and stage suggests that some testicular tumors may escape immune surveillance and become biologically more aggressive.\r"

  ".W": "Progressively transformed germinal centers occurred in about 3.5% of cases of chronic nonspecific lymphadenitis. They are larger than germinal centers and are composed of follicular mantle lymphocytes, small clusters of proliferating mainly medium-sized B- and T-cells, as well as an extensive network of follicular dendritic cells. Sixty-six patients with lymph node enlargement containing progressively transformed germinal centers and staging and sequential biopsies of 213 patients with Hodgkin's disease (mixed and nodular sclerosis type) were investigated with special reference to the relationship of this lesion to Hodgkin's disease. In most cases, progressively transformed germinal centers developed without any obvious signs of illness and seemed to have no association with Hodgkin's disease. The patients could be differentiated into two groups. The larger group, Group 1 (n = 55 of 66) consisted of patients showing progressively transformed germinal centers without association to Hodgkin's disease. The smaller group, Group 2 (n = 11 of 66) showed progressively transformed germinal centers obviously with association to nodular paragranuloma (Hodgkin's disease lymphocytic predominance type). Progressively transformed germinal centers preceding (n = 3), simultaneously (n = 4), and after development of nodular paragranuloma (n = 4) were found. With regard to subtypes of Hodgkin's disease other than paragranuloma, progressively transformed germinal centers also could be found in sequential biopsies of Hodgkin's disease of mixed and nodular sclerosis type. In one case, progressively transformed germinal centers preceded, in another case they occurred simultaneously in mixed type of Hodgkin's disease, and in two cases of nodular sclerosis type progressively transformed germinal centers developed after the onset of Hodgkin's disease. These findings suggest that progressively transformed germinal centers may be a result of different processes that may be occasionally related not only to nodular paragranuloma, but also in rare cases to nodular sclerosis and mixed type of Hodgkin's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Although the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the most common site of primary extranodal lymphomas, the lineage of these tumors has been controversial. The authors used paraffin-reactive antibodies detecting markers of B-, T-, histiocytic, and epithelial cells to study 34 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of the GI tract for which unequivocal frozen-section immunophenotypine was available as a control to determine whether these antibodies are reliable in the study of these tumors. Frozen-section studies revealed 31 tumors of B-cell origin and three T-cell tumors. Paraffin-reactive antibodies confirmed B-cell lineage in 28 of the 31 cases, with equivocal results in the remaining three. Only one of the T-cell lymphomas was identified in paraffin studies. Our results indicate that paraffin-reactive antibodies can reliably identify most B-cell lymphomas in the GI tract but may be unreliable in the detection of lymphomas of T-cell origin.\r"

  ".W": "New diagnostic tests frequently are evaluated against gold standards that are assumed to classify patients with unerring accuracy according to the presence or absence of disease. In practice, gold standards rarely are perfect predictors of disease and tend to misclassify a small number of patients. When an imperfect standard is used to evaluate a diagnostic test, many commonly used measures of test performance are distorted. It is not widely appreciated that these distortions occur in predictable directions and that they may be of considerable magnitude, even when the gold standard has a high degree of accuracy. The diagnostic powers of clinical tests will be more accurately reported if consideration is given to the types of biases that result from the use of imperfect standards. Several different approaches may be used to minimize these distortions when evaluating new tests.\r"
