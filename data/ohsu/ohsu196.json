  ".W": "Recent studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that 19-nor-deoxycorticosterone, a potent mineralocorticoid, has been excreted in excess in the urine of young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Although urinary 19-nor-deoxycorticosterone levels decline before the onset of hypertension, preliminary evidence suggests that 19-nor-deoxycorticosterone is further oxygenated to other steroid products in older SHR. Since 19-hydroxylation is the essential first step in the formation of 19-nor-deoxycorticosterone from deoxycorticosterone and since the mechanism-based aromatase inhibitor 10-propargyl-androst-4-ene,3,17-dione preferentially inhibits 19-hydroxylation, this agent was administered to weanling SHR to determine whether inhibition of 19-nor-deoxycorticosterone formation could modify or prevent hypertension. Accordingly, either 10 mg of 10-propargyl-androst-4-ene,3,17-dione or vehicle (control) was injected daily for several weeks in 4.5 week-old SHR. Injection of 10-propargyl-androst-4-ene,3,17-dione reduced urinary free 19-nor-deoxycorticosterone and retarded the development of hypertension compared with the effect of vehicle injection (p less than 0.05). Mean blood pressure levels in SHR receiving 10-propargyl-androst-4-ene,3,17-dione were lower than those in SHR receiving vehicle for each of the first 8 weeks of treatment (p less than 0.05). These data support the importance of 10-nor-corticosteroids in the pathogenesis of hypertension in SHR.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombin-induced aggregation and serotonin release were markedly enhanced in platelets from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) when compared with those from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Since phosphoinositides are involved in calcium-mediated platelet responses, the metabolism of these lipids was investigated in SHR and WKY by using 32P-labeled quiescent platelets. In unstimulated cells, both the rate and extent of 32P incorporation into individual inositol-containing phospholipids and phosphatidic acid were identical in SHR and WKY. This finding suggests that the pool size and basal turnover of phosphoinositides did not differ between the two strains. In contrast, early thrombin-induced phosphoinositide metabolism, when monitored as changes in [32P]phosphatidic acid, was significantly higher in SHR than in WKY. For example, a 20-second exposure to thrombin, 0.3 U/ml, induced the formation of 1.6 times more [32P]phosphatidic acid in SHR than in WKY. These results provide evidence for a leftward shift of the dose-response and time-course curves of thrombin-induced [32P]phosphatidic acid formation in SHR. Moreover, the extent of the difference between SHR and WKY was independent of the extracellular calcium concentration. Following thrombin stimulation, [32P]phosphatidic acid formation likely reflects the initial agonist-receptor interaction; therefore, these results suggest that phospholipase C activity is enhanced in platelets of SHR and that the hypersensitivity of phospholipase C in SHR may play a role in the overall alteration of cell calcium handling and, hence, in the platelet responses of SHR.\r"

We studied alpha-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral and renal cortex of Milan hypertensive strain (MHS) and normotensive strain (MNS) rats, a genetic model of spontaneous hypertension linked to a kidney abnormality. Binding of the selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist [3H]prazosin and the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist [3H]rauwolscine was used for receptor studies in tissues of prehypertensive (24-day-old) and hypertensive (60-day-old) rats. In the cerebral cortex, no between-strain differences in alpha 1-adrenergic and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density and affinity were observed in prehypertensive and hypertensive periods. The density of these receptors increased similarly with age in MHS and MNS rats. In the renal cortex, the differences between MHS and MNS rats concerned alpha 2-adrenergic receptors only. Compared with their age-matched normotensive controls, MHS rats showed 1) a lower affinity for the antagonist (p less than 0.05) in the prehypertensive period, 2) absence of the normal age-related increase in receptor density, and 3) a lower density of [3H]rauwolscine binding sites (p less than 0.001) in the hypertensive period. In this period, studies of competitive inhibition of [3H]rauwolscine binding showed that l-epinephrine bound to one class of sites in MHS rats (pseudo-Hill plot, 0.90) and to two classes in MNS rats (pseudo-Hill plot, 0.68). In addition, the lack of any guanylylimidodiphosphate effect on the l-epinephrine competition curve observed in MHS rats suggests the uncoupling of these receptors from the guanosine 5'-triphosphate binding protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although the existence of so-called streptozocin hypertension seems well established, some reports have indicated that no rise in blood pressure (BP) occurred after streptozocin treatments. To ascertain the streptozocin-induced BP response, normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated with streptozocin, 40 to 45 and 35 mg/kg i.v., respectively, and BP was determined directly and indirectly every week for 3 to 4 weeks. Direct mean BP was determined without anesthesia or restraint through a cannula inserted into the rat's abdominal aorta. Indirect BP was determined at the tail without anesthesia after prewarming the rat in a holder. Compared with control values, indirect BP increased significantly in diabetic WKY 2 weeks after streptozocin treatment. In contrast, direct BP of these rats decreased, compared with control values. Indirect BP of diabetic SHR was as high as that of the controls, whereas direct BP of diabetic SHR decreased significantly 1 week after the treatment and thereafter, compared with control values. These discrepancies between the direct and indirect BP values may be caused by severe emaciation of diabetic rats. Extra pressure in the cuff may be necessary to occlude the bloodstream. These results indicate that under these conditions the value of BP obtained by the direct measurement is more reliable than that by the indirect one; therefore, we concluded that so-called streptozocin hypertension does not exist.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies we identified an afferent renal nerve-dependent pressor reflex elicited by acute unilateral renal artery stenosis (50% decrease in renal blood flow) in conscious, instrumented rats with reduced responsiveness of arterial baroreceptor reflexes and the renin-angiotensin system. The pressor reflex involves a neurogenic increase in peripheral resistance. The present study examined the nature of the intrarenal stimulus underlying this renal pressor reflex. Rats were subjected to sinoaortic denervation and, 7 to 10 days later, were chronically instrumented with Doppler flow probes on the right renal artery, superior mesenteric artery, and abdominal aorta and with an occluder on the right renal artery. Following surgical recovery and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (captopril), animals received intravenous isotonic saline, 6% of body weight over 60 minutes. Saline infusion did not alter baseline hemodynamics, vascular neurogenic tone, or responsiveness to tyramine, but it attenuated the reflex by 70%. A second series of experiments examined a possible role for intrarenal prostaglandins, kinins, or adenosine in the activation of renal sensory receptors during renal stenosis. Prostaglandin inhibition with intravenous administration of indomethacin and meclofenamate virtually abolished the reflex in the face of enhanced tyramine responsiveness, whereas kallikrein inhibition (aprotinin) attenuated the reflex pressor response by 33%. Adenosine inhibition with aminophylline or adenosine deaminase had no effect on the reflex; these agents and aprotinin did not affect vascular neuroeffector responsiveness (tyramine). The data suggest that the renal pressor reflex may be mediated by renal sensory nerves, possibly chemoreceptors, whose activation could depend on renal excretory function and synthesis of prostaglandins and kinins.\r"

  ".W": "The interplay of heart rate variability, baroreceptor control of heart rate, and blood pressure (BP) variability was examined in chronically instrumented, unanesthetized, freely moving rats in which the efferent neural influences on heart rate were pharmacologically altered. In each rat, BP was recorded continuously for 90 minutes in the control condition and in one or more of the following conditions: 1) beta-adrenergic receptor blockade by propranolol, 1 mg/kg; 2) cholinergic blockade by atropine, 0.75 mg/kg, and 3) combined blockade by propranolol plus atropine. Each BP recording was analyzed beat-to-beat by a computer that calculated heart rate and BP variabilities, both expressed as variation coefficients. In addition, under each condition the sensitivity of the arterial baroreceptor control of heart rate was assessed by measuring the reflex changes in pulse interval in response to BP changes induced by bolus i.v. injections of phenylephrine and nitroprusside. As compared with the control condition, 1) propranolol (n = 10) reduced heart rate variability by 23 +/- 4% (p less than 0.01), only slightly impaired baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, and did not significantly modify BP variability (+11 +/- 7%); 2) atropine (n = 11) reduced heart rate variability by 30 +/- 7% (p less than 0.01), drastically impaired baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, and increased BP variability (+40 +/- 8%, p less than 0.01); 3) combined blockade (n = 10) caused variability and baroreceptor reflex changes similar to those induced by atropine alone. Thus, heart rate variability depends on both vagal and sympathetic influences. However, only the former component affects BP variability, that is, it plays an antioscillatory role.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The two groups did not differ in resting forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance, heart rate, or blood pressure. During mental stress, children with a family history of hypertension had a significantly greater increase in forearm blood flow than did children of normotensive parents (+37.5 +/- 8.0 vs +12.8 +/- 7.5%; p less than 0.05) and a trend toward reduced forearm vascular resistance (p = 0.08). Mental stress significantly increased systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.001), and heart rate (p less than 0.03) in both groups. The blood pressure and heart rate responses to stress were not significantly different between groups. There was no evidence of a prolonged response or a different pattern of recovery in children with a family history of hypertension. This study indicates that regional blood flow responses underlying similar blood pressure increases during mental stress may be different in adolescents with and without a family history of hypertension.\r"

Mean ultrafiltration rates of 6.4 +/- 3.0 ml/m2 b.s./min achieved mean serum creatinine levels of 2.39 +/- 1.49 mg/dl. Hypervolemia and pulmonary edema were corrected rapidly by CAVH. Total parenteral nutrition with a mean caloric intake of 62 +/- 15 kcal/kg b.w./day was provided throughout the hemofiltration period. In addition high ultrafiltration rates allowed delivery of large amounts of i.v. medications. CAVH is an ideal extracorporeal renal replacement system to control azotemia, fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base status in critically ill children. It carries the potential to improve survival rate in children with MOSF.\r"

PRL secretion is undoubtedly influenced by many substances, which can be variously altered in uremia: monoamines, endogenous opiates and PTH. Our data suggest that in early renal failure PRL levels are already significantly high and the 24-h pattern of PRL secretion is significantly different from that in controls. PRL derangements could be due in mild renal failure, to unknown factors (GABA?); in severe CRF, to a major change in dopaminergic activity; in hemodialysis (HD), to a low turnover of monoamines, and in peritoneal dialysis (PD) to increased activity of serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems.\r"

  ".W": "Dialysis is the conventional treatment for chronic renal failure. It is cumbersome, expensive and time-consuming and thus alternate treatments have long been sought. A compact system consisting of haemoperfusion in series with ultrafiltration can nearly replace dialysis. A urea removal system is the only step required to complete this approach. The potential of combining a microencapsulated enzyme, urease, with an ammonium ion adsorbent, zirconium phosphate, to remove urea was examined in vitro. Urease converts urea to ammonium ions which are then adsorbed onto zirconium phosphate. This combination would be most effective in the intestinal tract. The capacity of zirconium phosphate is probably not enough to effect the removal of enough urea to completely replace dialysis in patients with no renal function. However, this system could potentially 1) delay the onset of dialysis therapy in patients who still have some renal function, either alone or in combination with haemoperfusion-ultrafiltration, or 2) reduce dialysis treatment times.\r"

Most of the patients show a facial deformity alone or in combination with telecanthus, epiphora, exophthalmos, or nasal obstruction.

Surgery was the primary therapy in 45 patients (86%). The determinate \"cure\" rate at 5 and 10 years was 24 and 18%, respectively, for patients with parotid lesions and 20% for those with submandibular tumors. As with other malignant salivary gland tumors, advanced stage and pain as a presenting symptom were ominous findings. Locoregional recurrence was the usual site of failure in both parotid (51%) and submandibular (67%) cases. Radical surgical extirpation, preserving the facial nerve when possible, remains our treatment of choice. It is anticipated that planned postoperative radiotherapy will reduce our high locoregional recurrence rates.\r"

The laser has been proposed as an alternative method that might avoid this complication. A retrospective study comparing these excisional techniques was done at Walter Reed Army Medical Center between 1973 and 1983. Of a total of 58 lesions, 35 were T1N0M0 and 23 were T2N0M0 (two synchronous lesions being present). Of 35 lesions excised with a scalpel, 11 had an associated submandibular gland resection. Of the remaining 25, two developed secondary duct stenosis. Of 10 lesions excised with cautery, three had an associated excision of the submandibular gland. Of the remaining seven, two developed stenosis and one required subsequent excision of the gland. Of 12 lesions excised with laser, four developed stenosis and two required subsequent excision of the gland. Laser excision appears to be of no advantage in avoiding further surgery of the submandibular gland. A submandibular gland resection at the time of the original resection of T1N0 or T2N0 cancers of the FOM does not appear warranted.\r"

There actually had been fifty-four total hip replacements in fifty-three hips, as in one hip a revision was done for a traumatic disruption of the initial acetabular component that occurred two months after the first insertion. Six of the fifty-four operations did not qualify for inclusion in this ten-year follow-up study, including four operations in three patients who had died before that time. The remaining forty-eight hips have been followed for ten to 13.5 years (mean, 11.3 years). With one exception, the ages of the patients at the time of the index operation ranged from seventeen to fifty years (mean, forty-one years). Six (12.5 per cent) of the forty-eight hips required revision because of symptomatic aseptic loosening of the acetabular component. In addition, two acetabular components, although they were not loose, were revised concomitantly with revision of the femoral component because of the presence of radiolucent lines at the cement-bone interface of the acetabular implant. One other acetabular component that was not loose was revised because of unexplained pain, one was removed because of sepsis, and for one only the polyethylene liner was exchanged because of damage to the polyethylene when the weld holding the femoral head to the femoral neck failed. Nine additional hips (19 per cent), although they were not revised, showed radiographic evidence of migration, and one (2 per cent) showed radiographic evidence of impending failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-eight of the forty-five patients had no or slight pain after the second revision, and thirty reported that their condition was improved.

There was symptomatic loosening (moderate or severe pain and probable roentgenographic loosening) in six patients after the second revision and one after the third. Significant postoperative complications were noted in nineteen of the forty-five patients, and treatment was considered to be a failure in eleven hips after the second revision and in two after the third.\r"

The physiological cost-index of Butler et al. was used to assess energy consumption. Three patients had had unilateral disarticulation and three had had bilateral disarticulation. Kinematic studies showed persistent bilateral abduction of the hip throughout the gait cycle in all six patients. The flexion-extension arc of the hip was decreased in the three who had had bilateral disarticulation. Increased flexion of the hip was noted on the normal side and decreased flexion, on the affected side in those who had had unilateral disarticulation. Phase reversal of pelvic obliquity was noted in the amputees who had had bilateral disarticulation. The prosthetic knee showed good flexion during the swing phase. All patients showed a mild decrease in the velocity of gait and in the length of step and stride. The patients who had had unilateral disarticulation showed decreased duration of the bilateral stance and single stance phases and increased duration of the swing phase. Those who had had bilateral disarticulation of the knee had a normal distribution of the components of the gait cycle: bilateral stance, single stance, and swing. The physiological cost-index for all six was within the normal range, indicating minimum energy handicap.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Inadequate debridement, extensive scarring, and breakdown of the wound have been commonly encountered after surgical debridement has been employed as the initial treatment of infection with Mycobacterium marinum involving the deep structures of the hand. Because of our disappointment with the results of this form of treatment, from 1982 to 1986 we treated twenty-four patients who had such an infection with rifampicin and ethambutol after a diagnostic biopsy was done. Surgical treatment was deferred until it was determined that the infection had not been controlled by the chemotherapy. The clinical outcome for these patients could be divided into three patterns: eleven patients (Group I) had a good result with no complications, three patients (Group II) had delayed healing of the wound, and ten patients (Group III) did not have a good response to conservative treatment and required one or more surgical debridements. Complications were sometimes associated with use of the drugs, and loss of visual acuity was a concern in three patients. In twenty-one (87 per cent) of the patients, at follow-up the function of the treated hand was equal to that of the other hand. Persistent pain, a discharging sinus, and previous local injection of steroids were unfavorable prognostic factors. If these factors are present, surgical debridement is advised.\r"

  ".W": "Biplane roentgenography, axial roentgenography, and fluoroscopy are the usual roentgenographic methods of measuring femoral anteversion. These methods use a strict geometrical definition of anteversion. The computerized tomography method of measuring anteversion that was developed recently, and is now widely used, does not adhere to the accepted definition of anteversion and has not been tested for accuracy in a large series. In the present study, the widely used computerized-tomography method of measuring anteversion was tested on thirty-two femoral specimens. With that method, anteversion was consistently underestimated by an average of 10 degrees compared with direct measurements and was reproducible only to within +/- 3.6 degrees. Therefore, a new method of measuring anteversion using computerized tomography was developed. It was shown to be accurate to +/- 1 degree, as tested on the same specimens. This study demonstrated geometrically why the currently practiced computerized-tomography method of selecting the points that are used to define the axis of the femoral neck is not consistent with geometrical definitions of anteversion. A more accurate method for both defining the axis of the femoral neck and measuring femoral anteversion is described and recommended for clinical use.\r"

Repair did not have a statistically significant effect on the laxity or the strength of the medial collateral ligament. Allowing active motion had a statistically significant beneficial effect on the strength of the medial collateral ligament. Stability was adversely affected by active motion if the secondary restraints had been transected; however, when the secondary ligamentous restraints were intact, active motion was beneficial and immobilization was harmful.\r"

Specimens that had been obtained after periods of unilateral immobilization of the knee and remobilization were evaluated for structural properties. In addition, the mechanical properties of the substance of the medial collateral ligament and the histological characteristics of both the substance of the ligament and its sites of insertion were evaluated. After immobilization, there were significant reductions in the ultimate load and energy-absorbing capabilities of the bone-ligament complex, and an increased number of failures occurred by tibial avulsion. The tissue of the medial collateral ligament also became less stiff as a result of immobilization. Histologically, the femoral and tibial insertion sites showed increased osteoclastic activity, resorption of bone, and disruption of the normal attachment of the bone to the ligament. With remobilization, the ultimate load and energy-absorbing capabilities of the bone-ligament complex improved but did not return to normal. Failure by tibial avulsion became less frequent, and the stress-strain characteristics of the medial collateral ligament returned to normal. Histologically, the sites of insertion of the ligament also showed evidence of recovery.\r"

The burned animals were challenged with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1244 on the third postburn day. Neither indomethacin nor cimetidine altered the animals' clinical course. However cyclophosphamide, at a dosage of 2 mg/kg body weight/day, improved survival from 30% to 57% and prolonged mean survival time from 5.72 to 7.77 days. Cyclophosphamide, at a dosage of 15 mg/kg body weight/day, decreased mean survival to 3.63 days and percent survival to 0. These data show that treatment with cyclophosphamide could be beneficial in severe burn injury patients, but further work is necessary due to the dose-dependent nature of the drug.\r"

As a result, one can modify traditional predicted recommendations for nutrition alimentation of the burn patient with real-time data. In this study, 21 sequential adult admissions with second- and third-degree total body surface area (TBSA) burn wounds (range 21%-81% TBSA) underwent serial assessments of energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry. On admission, maximum, and discharge, measured energy expenditure (MEE) was compared with the calculations for predicted energy expenditure by the Curreri (CEE) and modified Harris-Benedict (MBEE) equations. The mean energy expenditure calculated from the Curreri equation on admission (CEEA) overestimated the mean MEE on admission (MEEA) by 25% (P less than 0.001) and on discharge (MEED) by 36% (P less than 0.0005). The mean modified Harris-Benedict equation overestimated the mean MEEA by 32% (P less than 0.0005) and the mean MEED by 39% (P less than 0.0005). No significant difference was noted between the mean MEE at maximum (MEEM) and the mean CEEA or the mean MBEEA. This indicates excessive overfeeding of the burn patient from admission to discharge by both standard formulas. Actual measured data provide a better indicator of varying nutritional needs throughout the hospital course than the standard formulas, and their use would result in significant savings in the expenses of enteral/parenteral nutritional supplements.\r"

While the high incidence of inhalation injury (16 out of 20 patients) and, therefore, the disproportionately high mortality rate (40% overall) in the study group do not permit extension of these observations to the burn patient population at large, certain cautious recommendations may be made with regard to the use of intravenous immunoglobulin G in the management of burn patients.\r"

Since 1972 this therapy has yielded good results by preventing necrosis of the injured hand and by helping to maintain function. However, the indications and timing for performing this operation still are poorly defined. The surgeon is faced with the difficult task of determining whether the injury is severe enough to affect distal circulation and thereby lead to necrosis. The lack of reliable clinical signs is chiefly responsible for this difficulty; however, the potential for delayed thrombosis of vessels complicates the problem. In this article, indications for early vascular grafting in an electrically injured wrist are discussed based on recent clinical experience, with emphasis on the use of arteriography. A case history involving electric burns of both upper extremities is presented as an illustration.\r"

The presence of viable dermal tissue and adnexal structures on histologic examination encouraged a program of observation and local wound care, which led to progressive healing of the wounds in 18 days. Histologic monitoring of the wounds proved to be a helpful adjunct in the clinical management of this difficult case.\r"

All animals were surface-cooled to 20 degrees C (rectal temperature) under halothane-diethyl ether azeotrope anesthesia and divided into 4 equal groups. In Groups I (non-arrest) and II (60 minute-arrest) 10% low molecular weight dextran (LMWD; 1 gm/kg = 10 ml/kg) was administered during cooling. Physiological saline (10 ml/kg) was given in Groups III (non-arrest) and IV (60 minute-arrest) during cooling. COP in LMWD groups increased significantly during cooling and was consistently higher than it was in the saline groups during rewarming. There were no significant differences in heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous (CVP) and pulmonary artery wedge pressures (PAW) between the 4 groups during cooling. The increase in hematocrit (Hct) in animals that received saline was significant at the end of cooling and during rewarming. Hct was not significantly changed in Group I throughout the procedure, whereas in Group II (60 minute-arrest) it increased significantly during rewarming despite the administration of LMWD. Rewarming time in Group II was significantly shorter than in Group IV (144.2 +/- 9.6 min vs 193.2 +/- 32.6 min, respectively). We conclude that the administration of LMWD effectively reduces hemoconcentration and is also beneficial for maintaining better peripheral circulation.\r"

The characteristics considered were the efficiency of the heat exchanger, the oxygenating capacity, traumatic effects on the blood and the direct effect on the renal and cardiopulmonary systems. The Capiox II demonstrated a better oxygenating capacity, less platelet damage, a smaller variation in the free plasma haemoglobin, a significant difference in postoperative bleeding and blood transfusion requirements, but showed no variation in renal and cardiopulmonary function. The authors suggest that the Capiox II is to be preferred for extra-corporeal circulation of medium duration, for which it combines the advantages of both bubble and membrane oxygenators, while being less complex and costly than previously marketed membrane devices.\r"

Eighty-eight valves were placed in mitral and 86 in aortic position. There were 92 males and 78 females with a mean age of 54.1 years (140 patients were in NYHA class III or IV (87.5%]. Single valve replacement was performed in 116 (72%) patients, 30 (19%) underwent multiple valve procedures and in 14 (9%) valve replacement was combined with coronary artery bypass surgery. There were no intraoperative deaths. Six patients died within the first month after surgery. One hundred and fifty-two (98.7%) patients were followed for a total of 190 patient years (average 14.8 months per patient). There were 8 late deaths (4.2 per 100 patient-years), 5 of these were valve related. Valve related complications were observed in 9 patients (4.5 per 100 patient-years). The overall incidence of peripheral embolization was 2.6 per 100 patient years. At the time of the follow-up study 136 (94%) patients were in functional class I and II. Fourteen patients with isolated AVR and six with MVR underwent hemodynamic evaluation on an average of 12 and 10 months after surgery. The early results suggest that the BSIM prosthesis represents a promising alternative in heart valve replacement, because there were no mechanical failures, thromboembolic complications are rare and hemodynamic performance is good.\r"

Pulmonary artery hemorrhage is a rare but frequently fatal complication and a mortality rate as high as fifty percent has been reported. In two of these cases, major retraction of the heart was needed for adequate exposure of the cardiac pathology. The Swan-Ganz catheter inadvertently was advanced into the wedge position for prolonged intervals of time, and periodic overdistention of the balloon occurred. The third case occurred in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. The need for aggressive surgical approach has been demonstrated. The authors have recommended steps to be taken when massive hemoptysis occurs and Swan-Ganz catheter perforation of the pulmonary artery is suspected. Re-evaluation of the \"routine\" use of the Swan-Ganz catheter may be necessary and overutilization may be a distinct possibility. When the use of this catheter is deemed appropriate, a more exact positioning of the distal portion of the catheter is mandatory if pulmonary artery perforation is to be avoided.\r"

Three patients with expanding aneurysms underwent emergency operations. Another three patients with extensive aneurysms had two-stage operations: initial aortic arch or descending thoracic graft replacement followed by thoracoabdominal graft replacement in the second stage. Exposure of the aneurysms was made through a left transthoracic, retroperitoneal abdominal approach in all patients. The surgical technique employed in most cases in this series was graft inclusion with direct reattachment of the visceral vessels by anastomosis to an opening made in the graft. Pairs of intercostal and lumbar arteries between the levels of the ninth thoracic and fourth lumbar regions were reconstructed in a similar fashion on the basis of monitoring somatosensory evoked potentials. The operations were performed with the aid of a partial femoro-femoral bypass with selective celiac and renal arterial perfusion in most cases. All patients but one survived the operation and are leading normal lives late in the postoperative period. Graft inclusion with the aid of a partial bypass is a valid technique for the treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms involving visceral branches.\r"

  ".W": "Over a nine-year period 1973 to 1982, 364 aorto-bifemoral bypass grafts were inserted for aorto-iliac occlusive disease and 45 graft failures were encountered. Twelve patients developed acute graft occlusion, occurring less than 30 days postoperatively (Group I). These failures were almost all due to technical problems, the most common cause was elevation of an intimal flap following local endarterectomy. Five patients (Group II) developed recurrent symptoms without actual thrombosis or occlusion of the graft, but were associated with neointimal hyperplasia at the distal anastomosis and evidence of distal atherosclerosis. Twenty-eight patients were late failures (Group III). These patients thrombosed their grafts more than 30 days postoperatively. Four patients thrombosed both limbs of the graft at separate intervals. Nineteen patients were found to have progressive atherosclerosis affecting their run-off vessels. Six patients were found to have stenosis limited to the distal anastomosis. False aneurysm, kinking of the graft, and proximal suture line stenosis were felt to be determining factors in 3 other incidences of graft failure. The most common treatment in Group I was thrombectomy and securing of the raised intimal flap. The patients in Group II were treated with local endarterectomy and patch angioplasty. Of the patients in Group III, the most common inflow procedure was thrombectomy, carried out in 17 cases. In Group III, 13 of 28 patients underwent profundaplasty to improve outflow. The importance of pre and postoperative angiography in defining the etiology of graft failure is stressed. It is important to rule out problems with the proximal anastomosis. Once inflow has been established, angiography should ensure that an adequate outflow procedure has been performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Their ages ranged from 38 to 84 years, mean 68.1 years. Five patients (11.1%) four of them women, were found to be affected by the disease. Their ages ranged from 54 to 80 years, mean 69 years. Clinical and laboratory findings included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, prolonged fever, continuous headache, sudden onset of unilateral blindness, intermittent mandibular claudication, severe anemia and myalgia. None of these, whether present in isolation or in various combinations, were of significant diagnostic value. All biopsies were examined both by light microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy. The former examination took about 5-7 days to complete, and the latter about 3 hours. Light microscopy studies showed that 46.6% of the arterial biopsies were normal, 42.3% were arteriosclerotic and 11.1% (5 specimens) were characteristic of giant cell arteritis. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the biopsies obtained from all five patients found to have temporal arteritis displayed the \"occlusive\" pattern: the three-laminar appearance of the artery was markedly distorted or lost, the internal elastic lamina was barely detectable, and the densely hypertrophied media and intima filled the arterial lumen, virtually obliterating it. We conclude that scanning electron microscopy is a quick and accurate procedure for diagnosis of temporal arteritis and that positive findings may be taken as an indication for immediate steroid treatment.\r"

Preoperative arteriography revealed extensive occlusion of the popliteotibial arteries, except for indistinct visualization of the tibio-peroneal trunk, in which conventional reconstructive surgery seemed not to be feasible because of poor distal run-off. An autogenous vein bypass graft between the distal superficial femoral artery and tibio-peroneal trunk was successfully made \"in-situ\", creating an adjunctive arteriovenous fistula. Postoperatively, the ankle pressure index of the posterior tibial artery was considerably increased from 0 to 0.65, and Doppler flow wave could be recorded.

Prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment can hope to improve current mortality of more than 50%.

  ".W": "Previous studies of the role of estrogen in primate luteolysis, designed to investigate the effects of estrogen antagonism or selective inhibition of luteal phase estrogen production on luteal function, have ignored the impact of such treatments on secretory endometrial development. We examined the effect of luteal phase estrogen antagonism on endometrial maturation and luteal function in six women. In each of two menstrual cycles in each woman, blood samples were obtained on alternate days from cycle days 3-9, daily until 1 day after the urinary LH surge (day 0), and again on alternate days until the onset of menses. In the second of each pair of cycles, clomiphene citrate (100 mg) was administered daily from 2 days after the LH surge until menses. Endometrial biopsy was performed 13 days after the LH surge in each cycle. Serum FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone (P) were measured by RIA. The endometrial histological date and concentration of cytosolic (C) and nuclear (N) estrogen (ER) and P (PR) receptors were determined. We found significant (P less than 0.05) increases in luteal phase serum FSH, LH, estradiol, and P levels in the clomiphene cycle compared to those in the control cycle. Endometrial histology was significantly (P less than 0.002) different during estrogen antagonism; a maturation delay of more than 2 days was found in all six women during the clomiphene cycle. Luteal phase duration was unchanged by clomiphene (P = 0.29). Endometrial ER-C [7.38 +/- 2.52 (+/- SEM) vs. 38.75 +/- 10.17 fmol/mg protein], ER-N (248 +/- 84 vs. 685 +/- 80 fmol/mg DNA), and PR-C (97 +/- 38 vs. 189 +/- 38 fmol/mg protein) were significantly lower (P less than 0.03) in the clomiphene cycle than in the control cycle, whereas PR-N was not different (P greater than 0.10). These data suggest that luteal phase estrogen 1) modulates endometrial PR and 2) plays an important role in secretory endometrial development.\r"

The samples were extracted with chloroform for measurement of the [3H]E1 formed, and the results were corrected for nonenzymatic hydrolysis. The mean E1 sulfatase activity in leukocytes isolated from normal women in the follicular phase of their cycle was 75% higher than that during the luteal [1840 +/- 179 (+/- SE) vs. 1048 +/- 101 fmol E1 micrograms protein-1 h-1; P less than 0.004] and higher than that in normal men (875 +/- 123; P less than 0.002), but was not different from that in menopausal (1349 +/- 151) or hirsute women (1700 +/- 222). In pregnant women, the mean leukocyte E1 sulfatase activity was significantly lower (861 +/- 147) than that in nonpregnant women in the follicular phase (P less than 0.003). These results suggest that progesterone may modulate E1 sulfatase activity, whereas estrogens do not.\r"

At a dose of 60 micrograms daily for 7 days, T3 induced a significant increase in leukocyte 86Rb(K) influx and a significant fall in plasma K concentrations. Plasma and intracellular Na concentrations did not change. [3H]Ouabain binding, a measure of Na-K ATPase units, did not change. A week after T3 administration, 86Rb(K) influx, Na efflux, and plasma K concentrations were normal. In a series of five hyperthyroid patients, both ouabain-sensitive 86Rb influx and [3H]ouabain binding were significantly greater than in normal subjects. We conclude that T3 stimulates 86Rb(K) influx and Na efflux by leukocytes in vivo independently of [3H]ouabain binding and that this increase is rapidly reversible. However, in hyperthyroid patients both 86Rb influx and [3H]ouabain binding are increased, probably due to prolonged exposure to thyroid hormone excess.\r"

  ".W": "One group has reported hypocalcemic individuals in families affected with familial benign hypercalcemia (FBH), suggesting either that FBH is merely an extreme of normality or that hypocalcemia is independently inherited in that kindred. To test these hypotheses, we examined the distributions of serum total calcium (Ca) values in 260 normal adults and 171 adult individuals in 21 FBH kindreds. We excluded from analysis the 21 adult probands, leaving 85 apparently affected persons (Ca, greater than 10.1 mg/dL or greater than 2.52 mmol/L) and 65 apparently unaffected individuals (Ca, less than or equal to 10.1 mg/dL or less than or equal to 2.52 mmol/L). Five FBH family members were hypocalcemic (less than 8.9 mg/dL or less than 2.22 mmol/L); of these, 3 had hypoproteinemia or hypoalbuminemia, 1 had surgical hypoparathyroidism, and 1 was pregnant (and thus excluded from further analysis). Histogram analysis suggested a bimodal distribution of Ca in the FBH families, and familial serum Ca levels were significantly elevated (P less than 0.001, rank sum). When only apparently unaffected family members were compared with normal individuals with serum Ca of 10.1 mg/dL or 2.52 mmol/L or less, the distributions were virtually identical. Our results indicate that hypocalcemia in members of families with FBH is of sporadic nongenetic origin. Furthermore, FBH is not an extreme of the normal distribution, but, instead, a clear disturbance with its own distribution about a supranormal mean serum calcium value.\r"

Seven normal men received cabergoline (600 micrograms, orally) on day 0 and underwent a MCP test on days -1, 1, 4, 8, 15, and 28. Fasting serum PRL levels were significantly depressed from days 1-14; the nadir value occurred on day 4. MCP-induced PRL release was significantly inhibited up to day 28, with a nadir on day 4. Two months later, four of the men received placebo on day 0, and tests with MCP were performed on days -1, 8, and 28; basal serum PRL levels and PRL responses to MCP were superimposable on days -1, 8, and 28. These data indicate that cabergoline is an effective long-acting inhibitor of PRL release in normal men, suitable for use in the management of hyperprolactinemic patients.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that the major secretory protein of the endometrium during the first trimester of pregnancy, pregnancy-associated endometrial alpha 2-globulin (alpha 2-PEG), also represented the major secretory protein during the mid- to late luteal phase. Recently, the major secretory endometrial protein during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle was identified as glycosylated PRL (G-PRL). Although certain properties of alpha 2-PEG resemble G-PRL, in this study G-PRL was demonstrated to be immunochemically distinct from alpha 2-PEG, and deglycosylation of alpha 2-PEG produced a protein unrelated to PRL. The sequence of the 38 N-terminal amnio acid residues of alpha 2-PEG was determined by a gas phase sequenator. A sequence of Met-Asp-Ileu-Pro-Gln-Thr-Lys-Gln-Asp-Leu-Glu-Leu-Pro-Lys-Leu-Ala-G ly-Lys-Trp- His-Ser-Met-Ala-Met-Ala-Thr-Asn-?-Ileu-Ser-Leu-Met-Ala-Thr-Leu-Lys -Ala-Pro was obtained which was unique and unrelated to that of PRL. However, sequence homology between alpha 2-PEG and the major milk whey protein beta-lactoglobulin of the horse was demonstrated. The data indicate that alpha 2-PEG is a unique protein and is a human homolog of the beta-lactoglobulin family.\r"

  ".U": "88033579\r", 
  ".W": "Experiments in rabbits suggest that a serum GH binding protein (GH-BP) probably is derived largely from hepatic membrane bound GH receptors. Human serum contains a specific GH binding protein which can be easily measured by incubation with [125I] hGH and separation of [125I] hGH-BP complexes from free [125I] hGH by gel filtration through an Ultrogel AcA 44 minicolumn. In each assay GH-BP activity of a reference (normal young adult) serum is similarly run and the results are expressed as a percentage of the activity of the unknown serum divided by the GH-BP activity of the reference serum after correction for the expected inhibition of GH binding resulting from the GH content of the unknown serum. The mean relative specific GH binding protein (RSGH-BP) of cord serum from 11 premature infants was only 3.2 +/- 1.4% (SE) and of cord serum from 17 full term infants was 14.9 +/- 2.5%. During the first two decades of life there was a progressive rise of RSGH-BP with considerable individual variation. The mean serum RSGH-BP of 13 such subjects was 54.5 +/- 6.2%. More uniform RSGH-BP results were obtained in serum from 15 young adults, 91.7 +/- 7.4%. Lower RSGH-BP 77.2 +/- 5.4% was found in serum from 12 healthy older adults (age 60 to 70 years). The low levels of RSGH-BP in fetal serum are consistent with the reported low concentrations of GH receptors in sheep and rat fetal liver membranes. We suggest the measurement of GH-BP activity provides a simple, noninvasive measure of the ontogeny of GH receptors of human beings.\r"

A melatonin index was determined by integration of the area below the curve of serum melatonin concentrations during 24-h periods in both seasons. During the dark season, the daytime 12-h melatonin index and daytime urinary melatonin excretion were significantly higher than during the light season. In addition, the duration of the nocturnal melatonin pulse (serum melatonin levels, greater than 65 pmol/L) was lengthened during this season, whereas the mean serum estradiol concentration was significantly decreased at the time of ovulation and during the luteal phase of the cycle, indicating lowered ovarian activity. Luteal phase gonadotropin concentrations were increased during the dark season, which was also characterized by increased sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and decreased free testosterone concentrations and free androgen indices (ratio of testosterone to SHBG X 700) throughout the menstrual cycle. The dark season was thus characterized by increased melatonin secretion and decreased ovarian and androgenic activities. In summary, we characterized two season-dependent hormonal phenomena. Although we did not prove any cause and effect association between melatonin and anterior pituitary-ovarian hormones, the inverse seasonal relationship in pineal gland and ovarian secretion suggests that melatonin is causally related to reproduction in humans.\r"

Toward the end of each diet period 240 nmol 3,3'-T2 (126 micrograms) and 80 nmol 3',5'-T2 (42 micrograms) were infused for 7 h, and a bolus injection of 137 nmol 3,5-T2 (72 micrograms) was followed by a 12-h infusion of 69 nmol 3,5-T2 (36 micrograms) and 111 nmol rT3 (72 micrograms) on another day. [125I]T3 (30 muCi) was injected on the third day. The T2 and rT3 concentrations were measured by RIA during the 2 days of infusion, and the serum disappearance of [125I]T3 was studied by immunoprecipitation and trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the labeled T3. Four to 5% of the plasma disposal of T3 was accounted for by 3'-monodeiodination, and 36-39% by 5-monodeiodination. Increasing caloric intake resulted in a higher overall plasma disposal rate of T3, but no change in the percentage of T3 metabolized by monodeiodination pathways. In contrast, 5'-monodeiodination accounted for 21% of the total plasma disposal of rT3 during the low calorie diet and 45% during the high calorie intake. This increase in 5'-monodeiodination of rT3 was at the expense of alternative pathways of disposal. A marked increase in the plasma clearance rate of 3,5-T2 was also found during the high calorie diet, indicating that the level of caloric intake affects pathways of metabolism other than outer ring monodeiodination. These studies emphasize the important role played by diet in the regulation of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism through modulating outer ring monodeiodination, and that overnutrition changes other pathways of iodothyronine metabolism as well.\r"

Plasma androgen concentrations were normal, and plasma aldosterone and renin levels were low. One patient, who had benign adrenocortical adenoma, had normal plasma cortisol levels. The other patient, who had metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma, had low plasma cortisol, presumably due to elevated plasma corticosterone levels. While tumors producing only 17-deoxysteroids are rare, they have provided new insights into the regulation of 17-deoxysteroid secretion by the ZF. Presumptive suppression of a non-ACTH factor by adenoma-produced DOC transiently impaired the early postoperative responses to ACTH of the ZF 17-deoxysteroids of the contralateral adrenal. The dissociation of 17-deoxysteroids from cortisol in normal subjects given either dexamethasone or DOC acetate provides additional evidence for such a factor.\r"

Previous studies correlated plasma melatonin levels with several physiological parameters or determined the responses to pharmacological doses of melatonin during daylight hours. We established an acute model that is more rigorously physiological. Constant nocturnal bright light in sleep-deprived normal men resulted in low plasma melatonin levels throughout the night, in contrast to sleep in the dark and dim light sleep deprivation nights. Subsequently, melatonin was infused during bright light exposure to approximate physiological levels. Plasma GH and PRL measurements in these four conditions revealed an effect of sleep deprivation independent of the presence or absence of melatonin. A subsample of these men had an intermediate level of melatonin suppression with 500 lux light intensity, relative to those during sleep and bright light. The results suggest that melatonin has no acute modulatory effect on the secretion of these two sleep-related hormones.\r"

In the adrenals, E1 [median, 2.8 ng/g (10.4 pmol/g); range, 1.1-4.8 ng/g (4.1-17.8 pmol/g)] and E2 [median, 3.0 ng/g (10.9 pmol/g); range, 1.2-5.3 ng/g (4.4-19.5 pmol/g)] were found in similar concentrations and were independent of age and sex. In the gonads, E2 was the major estrogen, but the concentrations differed markedly between the sexes; E2 exceeded E1 almost 10-fold in the ovaries and 2-fold in the testes. On the average, the gonads of the infant girls had 5 times more E2 and 2 times more E1 than those of the boys. As in plasma, E2 concentrations were highest in the ovaries of 1- to 6-month-old girls [median, 10.5 ng/g (38.5 pmol/g); range, 1.1-55.1 ng/g (4.0-202.0 pmol/g)] and in testes of 1- to 3-month-old boys [median, 1.8 ng/g (6.6 pmol/g); range, 0.6-6.4 ng/g (2.3-23.5 pmol/g)]. Ovarian E2 concentrations declined to less than 3.0 ng/g (11.0 pmol/g) by the end of the first year of life, and testicular E2 declined to less than 1.0 ng/g (3.7 pmol/g) after only 6 months of age. Gonadal estrogen concentrations paralleled changes in gonadal morphology. Ovarian weights varied in a pattern of rise and fall similar to that of ovarian E2 concentrations; the biggest ovaries contained multiple macroscopic cysts. Testicular E2 closely correlated with Leydig cell development and testicular testosterone concentrations. We infer, therefore, that the surge of plasma E2 in infant girls originates from ovarian follicles and that of boys from testicular Leydig cells, and that these both occur as a result of the postnatal surge in gonadotropin secretion. The basal plasma E1 and E2 pool, however, is derived from the adrenals and remains at a comparatively constant level in both sexes.\r"

We compared the rises in plasma FFA levels 4 h after an im injection of 0.2 U/kg of either pituitary hGH (n = 5) or biosynthetic methionyl hGH (n = 32) to hypopituitary patients. In each patient, plasma FFA levels also were measured during a similar period of fasting alone, without hGH injection. Plasma FFA levels rose between 0800 and 1230 h in both subgroups of patients during fasting alone. Injection of either pituitary or biosynthetic methionyl hGH led to a greater increase in plasma FFA than that induced by fasting alone, and the percent increases over baseline plasma FFA levels induced by either pituitary or synthetic hGH were similar. Triceps skinfold thickness before and after 3 months of treatment with biosynthetic hGH in 20 patients diminished by a mean of 2.5 mm, a decrease similar to that reported with pituitary hGH. We conclude that the acute and chronic lipolytic effect of hGH in man is an intrinsic property of the hGH molecule.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of transglutaminases, the Ca2+-dependent protein cross-linking enzymes, in the human pituitary gland was investigated by immunohistological methods using specific antibodies. Tissue-type transglutaminase was specifically localized in ACTH-producing cells, and the cells producing GH, PRL, TSH, FSH, and LH contained no appreciable amount of the enzyme. No detectable plasma-type transglutaminase (coagulation factor XIII) was found in pituitary tissue. In a previous study we demonstrated that ACTH-producing cells contain very little Ca2+-dependent proteinases (calpain), but a remarkable amount of their inhibitor, calpastatin. Pituitary gland cells producing hormones other than ACTH contained calpains, but no detectable calpastatin. These results collectively suggest that intracellular substrate proteins in ACTH-producing cells are protected from Ca2+-dependent degradation and are substrates for Ca2+-dependent cross-linking catalyzed by the tissue-type transglutaminase. In other pituitary gland cells, conversely, the intracellular substrate proteins are more likely to undergo Ca2+-dependent degradation than cross-linking.\r"

In African pygmies and other individuals with the pygmy trait, serum GH and IGF-II are similar to levels in taller subjects, but serum IGF-I levels are low. To determine whether another population with comparably short stature has similar or related defects, we studied the Mountain Ok population of Papua New Guinea. The mean height of adult men was 152 +/- 6.0 (+/- SD) cm (n = 141), and that of women was 146 +/- 5.7 cm (n = 150). Serum GH and IGF-II concentrations were in the normal (U.S.) range in the Mountain Ok subjects. In the men, serum IGF-I values were also normal, thereby distinguishing the endocrine profile associated with short stature in these subjects from that in African pygmies. Serum IGF-I was not measured in any Mountain Ok women. Since marginal dietary protein is characteristic of the traditional Papua New Guinea diet, we determined serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations in the Mountain Ok subjects. The serum proteins were in the normal (U.S.) range (30-50 g/L for albumin; 10-40 mg/dL for prealbumin), indicating that chronic or acute malnutrition was unlikely in these subjects. Taken together, these findings indicate that short stature in the Mountain Ok people of Papua New Guinea is associated with normal serum GH, IGF-I, IGF-II, and protein levels and indicate that other factors determine stature in some populations with short stature.\r"

During the control test the initial (postabsorptive state) concentrations and turnover rates of NEFA and KB were 476 +/- 47 (+/- SEM) and 4.30 +/- 0.17 mumol kg-1 min-1 (NEFA) and 126 +/- 17 and 2.49 +/- 0.07 mumol kg-1 min-1 (KB). The fraction of NEFA converted into KB was between 11.5-14.6%. Raising NEFA levels to about 650 mumol L-1 (iv infusion of a triglyceride emulsion) resulted in an increase in this fraction to between 26-30.3% (P less than 0.01). When NEFA concentrations were next abruptly raised to high levels (near 3 mmol L-1) by heparin injection this fraction returned to near the initial values (15-19.2%). During the EPI infusion test the initial (postabsorptive) concentrations and turnover rates of NEFA and KB as well as the fraction of NEFA converted into KB (10.5-11.5%) were comparable to the initial values of the control test. Intravenous infusion of EPI (10 ng kg-1 min-1) raised NEFA between 600 and 750 mumol L-1, comparable to values during the triglyceride test, but the fraction of NEFA converted into KB remained between 8.2-12% (P less than 0.05 vs. control test); when NEFA then were raised to even higher values (near 2.5 mmol L-1) by the infusion of a triglyceride emulsion and the injection of heparin, this fraction decreased to between 4-8% (P less than 0.05 vs. initial values of the EPI test and P less than 0.05 vs. the control test). In conclusion, 1) the fraction of NEFA converted into KB appears to depend in part on the NEFA concentration; and 2) the net effect of EPI infusion was to decrease the fraction of NEFA converted into KB.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with nonthyroid illness (NTI) often have reduced serum T3, free T3, T4, and free T4 concentrations. Paradoxically, serum TSH is usually in the normal range. The data suggest a diagnosis of hypothalamic hypothyroidism, in which TSH may have reduced biological activity because TRH, which is necessary for key steps in the glycosylation of TSH, is deficient. To study the glycosylation of TSH in patients with NTI, we measured the serum TSH concentration in 36 such patients hospitalized on our intensive care units and compared the results with those from a group of 18 normal subjects. Serum TSH was measured in 2 assays: 1) a sensitive TSH RIA of unextracted serum (TSH-RIA) and 2) a RIA of serum TSH after its extraction with Concanavalin-A (Con-A), a lectin which binds glycoproteins containing mannose residues in their oligosaccharide side-chains (TSH-Con-A). The ratio of TSH-Con-A to TSH-RIA was significantly reduced in the NTI patients [0.61 +/- 0.03 (+/- SE) vs. 0.89 +/- 0.05 in the normal subjects] due to reduced binding of the TSH to the Con-A. This change was not dependent on the extent of the abnormalities of thyroid hormone levels. The data suggest that the TSH secreted in NTI has altered glycosylation which is associated with reduced biological activity. This finding may explain in part the low serum T4 level in NTI patients in the face of an apparently normal immunoreactive TSH level.\r"

The RIA was specific for inhibin, and inhibin subunits and related proteins cross-reacted minimally in it. In the early to midfollicular phase, inhibin levels changed little, while in the late follicular phase, inhibin levels rose, in parallel with estradiol (r = 0.43; P less than 0.05; n = 22), to a peak level of 714 (407-1267) U/L (geometric mean +/- 67% confidence limits) coincident with the midcycle LH and FSH surges. An inverse relationship was found between serum inhibin and FSH during the mid- to late follicular phase (r = 0.42; P less than 0.01; n = 45). Inhibin levels rose further during the luteal phase to a peak level of 1490 (1086-2028) U/L 7-8 days after the LH surge, and they correlated positively with serum progesterone (r = 0.76; P less than 0.001; n = 49) and inversely with serum FSH (r = 0.43; P less than 0.01; n = 49) throughout the luteal phase. We conclude that 1) circulating inhibin is detectable throughout the normal menstrual cycle; 2) in the late follicular phase, inhibin levels rise in parallel with estradiol, consistent with the concept that both are products of the maturing follicle; 3) in the luteal phase, the profile of inhibin suggests that it is a secretory product of the corpus luteum; and 4) the inverse relationship between inhibin and FSH in the follicular phase is consistent with the inhibin hypothesis, while at midcycle there is loss of the inhibitory effect of inhibin on FSH secretion. The inverse relationship between FSH and inhibin during the luteal phase suggests a hitherto unsuspected role for inhibin in the feedback regulation of FSH secretion.\r"

  ".U": "88033602\r", 
  ".W": "Plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels were measured at 20-min intervals for 24 h in six young women with unipolar endogenous depression and in eight normal women during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The women with depression had a marked increase (P less than 0.005) in mean ACTH pulse frequency [14.5 +/- 0.6 (+/-SE) pulses/24 h] compared with normal women (9.9 +/- 0.7 pulses/24 h), while mean ACTH pulse amplitude and 24-h transverse mean ACTH levels were similar in the two groups. In contrast, 24-h transverse mean cortisol levels were higher (P less than 0.02) in the depressed women (242 +/- 28 nmol/L) than in the normal women (163 +/- 10 nmol/L). This hypercortisolemia in the depressed women was accompanied by markedly increased (P less than 0.001) episodic cortisol secretion (286 +/- 24 X 10(2) nmol/L X min) compared with that in normal women (155 +/- 17 X 10(2) nmol/L X min), and the secretory episodes were both longer in duration (P less than 0.05) and of higher amplitude (P less than 0.05) in the depressed women. The circadian variations in ACTH and cortisol were maintained in these depressed women, and the times of the circadian nadir, as determined by cosinor analysis, were similar to those in the normal women. However, the mean length of the evening quiescent period of cortisol secretion was far shorter (P less than 0.005) in the depressed women (27 +/- 8 vs. 202 +/- 40 min). Moreover, the postlunch rise in serum cortisol was significantly higher (P less than 0.02) in the depressed women (204 +/- 29 vs. 111 +/- 15 nmol/L). These results provide evidence that the hypercortisolism in depressed women is associated with an increase in ACTH pulse frequency, expanded cortisol secretory episodes, including a greater postlunch rise in cortisol, and a shortened evening quiescent period of cortisol secretion. Our findings provide evidence for centrally mediated activation of the ACTH-cortisol system in women with depression without a phase shift in circadian rhythm.\r"

In period I, a diet was given to maintain constant weight for 3 weeks. In period II, total calories were restricted to 600 kilocalories/day for 3 weeks. In period III, caloric intake was adjusted to maintain weight at the lower level for 6 weeks. The lower calorie diet decreased plasma very low density, low density, and high density lipoprotein (HDL), cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B and A-I concentrations and molar enzyme activities, while the percent conversion of free to esterified cholesterol by the LCAT enzyme was unchanged. During weight stabilization at a lower state (period III), the mean plasma HDL cholesterol level increased, and lipoprotein lipase and LCAT activities increased to values higher than those in period I. The mean HTGL activity remained reduced. I conclude that successful weight loss improves the possibly atherogenic plasma lipoprotein profile of obese subjects. The increase in HDL cholesterol and cholesterol esterification, possibly explained by lowered HTGL enzyme activity, may increase the capacity of HDL to transport cholesterol from peripheral cells to the liver.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of moderate physical exercise (performed on a bicycle ergometer to 70-75% of maximum oxygen consumption) without fluid replenishment on urinary chemistries and crystallization of kidney stone-forming substances were compared to those of rest in six normal subjects. Moderate physical exercise significantly decreased urinary pH [from 6.35 +/- 0.32 (+/-SD) to 5.79 +/- 0.33; P less than 0.05] and citrate [from 121.1 +/- 63.5 to 88.2 +/- 44.4 mg/6-h period from initiation of physical exercise; P less than 0.05 (630 +/- 331 to 459 +/- 231 mumol/6 h)], owing to induced metabolic acidosis. The total renal excretion of stone-forming constituents decreased [for example, calcium from 31.2 +/- 15.8 to 21.4 +/- 6.5 mg/6 h (0.8 +/- 0.4 to 0.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/6 h), phosphorus from 155 +/- 42 to 127 +/- 27 mg/6 h (5.01 +/- 1.4 to 4.1 +/- 0.9 mmol/6 h), and uric acid from 172 +/- 60 to 117 +/- 13 mg/6 h (1.0 +/- 0.4 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 mmol/6 h), each P less than 0.05], probably due to extracellular volume contraction (from sweating) and enhanced renal tubular reabsorption. However, the urinary concentration of stone-forming constituents significantly increased during and after moderate exercise because of the fall in urinary volume from 847 +/- 312 to 290 +/- 36 ml/6 h (P less than 0.01). Thus, urinary calcium oxalate saturation increased significantly from 2.62- to 6.68-fold saturation (P less than 0.01). The urinary undissociated uric acid concentration significantly rose [from 31.6 +/- 24.8 to 125.7 +/- 60.3 mg/L (0.19 +/- 0.15 to 0.76 +/- 0.36 mmol/L; P less than 0.01)], due to higher total uric acid concentration and reduced urinary pH. The saturation of calcium phosphate (brushite) did not change significantly, because the rise in urinary calcium concentration was compensated for by reduced phosphate dissociation (from lower urinary pH). The propensity for spontaneous precipitation of calcium oxalate was greater after exercise, as less soluble oxalate was required to elicit nucleation of calcium oxalate [58.0 +/- 21.2 to 49.0 +/- 16.4 mg/L (644 +/- 236 to 544 +/- 182 mumol/L); P less than 0.05]. The results suggest that moderate physical exercise, without increased fluid intake to compensate for excessive sweating, may cause the crystallization of uric acid and calcium oxalate in urine and may enhance the risk of the formation of renal stones composed of these salts.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence indicates that human thyroid peroxidase (TPO) has most of the characteristics of the thyroid microsomal antigen. The question of whether TPO accounts for part or all of the antigenic activity recognized by circulating anti-microsomal antigen autoantibody (anti-M Ab) remains to be determined. The availability of an anti-TPO monoclonal antibody and of a highly purified TPO preparation allowed the development of specific and sensitive radioassays for anti-TPO autoantibody (anti-TPO Ab). In this study we compared anti-M Ab and anti-TPO Ab levels in serum from 128 subjects, including patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n = 31), idiopathic myxedema (n = 11), hyperthyroid Graves' disease (n = 45), miscellaneous nonautoimmune thyroid disorders (n = 9), and normal subjects (n = 32). Anti-M Ab and anti-TPO Ab were measured by radioimmunological methods employing two different assay designs: 1) competitive radioassay (CR), based on the inhibition of radioiodinated antibody binding to human thyroid microsomes coated on microtiter wells, using a) [125I]immunoglobulin G (IgG) containing a high anti-M Ab titer (for anti-M Ab determinations), or b) [125I]anti-TPO monoclonal antibody (for anti-TPO Ab); and 2) sandwich immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) using microtiter wells coated with thyroid microsomes (for anti-M Ab determinations) or immunoaffinity-purified TPO (for anti-TPO Ab determinations) and [125I]anti-human IgG antibody. Anti-M Ab also was measured by passive hemagglutination. Anti-M Ab titers by PH closely correlated with anti-TPO Ab levels whether assayed by IRMA (r = 0.905; P less than 0.00001) or CR (r = 0.922; P less than 0.00001). Even closer correlations were found when anti-M Ab and anti-TPO Ab both were measured by the same type of radioassay procedure (IRMA, r = 0.945 and P less than 0.00001; CR, r = 0.957 and P less than 0.00001). No differences in the correlation between anti-M Ab and anti-TPO Ab results were found when the data in patients with different autoimmune thyroid disorders were analyzed separately. Further and more direct evidence for the identity of anti-M Ab and anti-TPO Ab was provided by the ability of purified TPO to completely inhibit the binding to thyroid microsomes of radioiodinated IgG preparations containing high anti-M Ab titers. In conclusion, our results provide strong support for the concept that TPO accounts for virtually all of the antigenic determinants reacting with the autoantibodies commonly termed anti-M antibodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The importance of recognizing early melanoma is generally accepted. Because not all pigmented skin lesions can be diagnosed correctly by their clinical appearance, additional criteria are required for the clinical diagnosis of such lesions. In vivo epiluminescence microscopy provides for a more detailed inspection of the surface of pigmented skin lesions, and, by using the oil immersion technic, which renders the epidermis translucent, opens a new dimension of skin morphology by including the dermoepidermal junction into the macroscopic evaluation of a lesion. In an epiluminescence microscopy study of more than 3000 pigmented skin lesions we have defined morphologic criteria that are not readily apparent to the naked eye but that are detected easily by epiluminescence microscopy and represent relatively reliable markers of benign and malignant pigmented skin lesions. These features include specific patterns, colors, and intensities of pigmentation, as well as the configuration, regularity, and other characteristics of both the margin and the surface of pigmented skin lesions. Pattern analysis of these features permits a distinction between different types of pigmented skin lesions and, in particular, between benign and malignant growth patterns. Epiluminescence microscopy is thus a valuable addition to the diagnostic armamentarium of pigmented skin lesions at a clinical level.\r"

Improvement in diagnostic accuracy was as follows: for small nodular melanomas, from 50% to 70%; for superficial spreading melanoma in situ, from 46% to 80%; for invasive superficial spreading melanoma, from 64% to 90%; and for early lentigo maligna and lentigo maligna melanoma, from 67% to 88%. Conversely, the diagnosis of pigmented Spitz nevi improved from 46% to 93% and of pigmented basal cell carcinomas from 60% to 90%, which appears equally important because most of these lesions had clinically been considered to represent melanomas. The use of epiluminescence microscopy also resulted in considerable improvement in the diagnosis of dysplastic nevi, which was particularly helpful in making therapeutic decisions. Epiluminescence microscopy greatly expands the diagnostic armamentarium available for pigmented skin lesions at a clinical level and thus increases the chances of detecting or ruling out melanoma in its earliest stages.\r"

The 4-hour chromium51 (51Cr) release assay was used to determine the activity of natural killer (NK) cells in the peripheral blood against K562 and Molt-4 target cells. Patients with vitiligo had a 50%, 67%, and 60% decrease in the cytotoxic response with Molt-4 cells at effector-target ratios of 25:1, 50:1, and 100:1, respectively, in comparison with control subjects (p less than 0.001). This inhibition was consistent with an 80% decrease in the binding capacity of NK cells to Molt-4 target cells (p less than 0.005). In contrast, cytotoxic responses did not differ in patients and control subjects with K562 target cells. These results suggest that patients with vitiligo have a decreased capacity for effector cell recognition of Molt-4 target cells but not K562 target cells. Hence patients with vitiligo may have defective clones of NK cells that are incapable of initial recognition of Molt-4 target cells, a necessary prerequisite for target cell lysis. Perhaps this phenomenon occurs with other tumor cells, which would explain the association of vitiligo with certain internal malignancies.\r"

Simple objective laboratory methods are suggested for the evaluation of prednisone intake, taking advantage of the similar chemical structure of cortisol and prednisolone. A linear correlation was found between the dose of prednisone, above 40 mg/day, free urinary prednisolone, measured with an radioimmunoassay kit for cortisol that cross-reacts with prednisolone, and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, measured by Metcalf's method. Approximately 9% of the prednisone administered was recovered as free prednisolone and about 40% as 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. It is suggested that these simple laboratory methods constitute a useful substitute for the more costly, sophisticated methods available at present for determining levels of prednisone and prednisolone.\r"

Six patients subsequently developed systemic disease. Although the gross morphology of the skin lesions is variable, the pathology is distinctive. An adequate deep biopsy shows the characteristic lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with variable numbers of atypical cells. Angiodestruction is less evident in the skin compared to other organs. The infiltrate surrounds and invades not only vessels but also nerves and epidermal appendages. The skin biopsy specimen can be differentiated from the lymphomatous infiltrates and Wegener's granulomatosis. Two of the patients who developed systemic disease were diagnosed by skin biopsy but clinicians failed to institute therapy, preferring to wait for other organ involvement. In addition, two patients developed lymphoma, one of which was confirmed at autopsy and one on subcutaneous and bone marrow biopsy 5 years after the initial skin diagnosis. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis can be diagnosed by performing a skin biopsy. Appropriate chemotherapy may result in a high percentage of complete remissions and therefore the dermatopathologist can play an important role in the early diagnosis of this potentially fatal disease.\r"

  ".W": "Demographic studies in patients with skin cancer have demonstrated the importance of exposure to ultraviolet and x-ray irradiation. This paper describes in vitro studies in peripheral lymphocytes from three patients with the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Particular stress was placed on the following factors: (1) the distribution of the lymphocyte subsets, (2) the frequency of spontaneous sister chromatid exchange, (3) the effect of ultraviolet C (UVC) (254 nm) on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, (4) the effect of UVC on the phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, and (5) the capacity to repair x-ray-induced DNA damage. Our data indicate that the distribution of the peripheral lymphocytes was normal, while the frequency of spontaneous sister chromatid exchange was high. The capacity of the lymphocytes to repair x-ray-induced DNA damage was low in all three patients. In two patients the UVC-induced DNA synthesis was reduced, while an increased UVC-induced inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation was observed. These cellular responses in vitro to ultraviolet and x-ray irradiation correspond to the clinical features of the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. A clearly defective in vitro cellular response to x-ray irradiation, reflecting the clinically evident x-ray sensitivity in the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, has not been reported previously.\r"

Since these diseases share cutaneous fibrosis as the final outcome and have other clinical and pathologic features that are difficult to differentiate, the presence of blood eosinophilia may be a further source of confusion. In this study, we examined the frequency and level of blood eosinophilia in 715 patients with systemic sclerosis, 72 patients with localized scleroderma, and 22 patients with clinically active eosinophilic fasciitis. When defined as greater than 400 cells/mm3, eosinophilia was present in 7% of patients with systemic sclerosis, 31% of patients with localized scleroderma, and 83% of patients with eosinophilic fasciitis. Greater than 1000 eosinophils/mm3 were present less frequently in systemic sclerosis (1%) and localized scleroderma (8%) than in eosinophilic fasciitis (61%). No difference in the frequency of eosinophilia was present in patients with the limited cutaneous CREST syndrome or the diffuse cutaneous variety of systemic sclerosis, and in these patients the presence of eosinophilia did not correlate with the extent of cutaneous or internal organ involvement or with other laboratory abnormalities. Among patients with localized scleroderma, eosinophilia was more common in those with linear scleroderma and generalized morphea than in those with morphea, and both the frequency and level of eosinophilia were greater in individuals with clinically active disease (p less than 0.02). Eosinophilia was a persistent feature in untreated patients with active eosinophilic fasciitis, even up to 30 months of disease duration.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple lesion transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed in 428 patients. Angioplasty was attempted in 1,047 lesions (2.4/patient), with an angiographic success achieved in 94%: 2 lesions were attempted in 74%, 3 in 21%, 4 in 5% and 5 or more in 1% of cases. A clinical success was achieved in 404 (94%) of the patients: 95% with and 93% without prior surgery and in 94% of those with single vessel disease and 94% of those with multivessel disease. Significant complications occurred in 17 patients (4.0%): 11 (2.5%) had a transmural infarction, 9 (2.1%) required urgent surgery and 6 (1.4%) died. An apparent lesion recurrence occurred in 106 (26%) of 404 patients with 81 of 89 patients (91%) having a successful second angioplasty. A second apparent lesion recurrence occurred in 15 patients (19%), with 13 of the 15 patients having a successful third angioplasty. A sustained clinical improvement (mean follow-up period 28.3 +/- 16 months) was obtained in 208 (83%) of 250 patients with successful angioplasty. The cumulative probability of survival at 51 months was 93% in these 250 patients. Survival was adversely affected by the presence of prior bypass surgery (no prior surgery 97% versus prior surgery 81%; p less than 0.05). These data suggest that multiple lesion angioplasty can be successfully performed with a good success rate, an acceptable incidence of complications and a reasonable expectation of satisfactory long-term clinical improvement.\r"

Patients were classified into those with (group A, nine patients) and those without (group B, seven patients) a perfusion defect on thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy. For the entire QRS complex the residue of group B was smaller than that of normal subjects (20.0 +/- 4.1% versus 24.6 +/- 3.5%, p less than 0.05). Group A showed a greater mean residue value than group B (27.4 +/- 4.4% versus 20.3 +/- 2.4%, p less than 0.01) only during the initial one-third of the QRS complex. All but one patient of group A and only one patient in group B showed a high peak on the residue curve during the initial stage of the QRS complex. The maximal residue value of group A during the initial QRS complex was significantly greater than that of group B (40.9 +/- 10.9% versus 23.4 +/- 5.4%, p less than 0.01). An arbitrarily selected criterion of the maximal residue value greater than or equal to 30% during the initial QRS complex showed a sensitivity of 89% with a specificity of 86% for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block. These results might be related to the complex ventricular activation around the infarcted area even in the presence of left bundle branch block in which intramyocardial conduction with a simple activation front predominates. Dipole analysis appeared to be a valuable method of diagnosing myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound recordings of blood flow velocity in the superior vena cava were made in 40 healthy adults (aged 22 to 69 years) during both normal respiration and 10 second episodes of apnea. The forward flow velocity pattern was biphasic, with systolic flow velocity greater than diastolic flow velocity. During apnea, peak flow velocities ranged from 32 to 69 cm/s (mean 45.7 +/- 8.4) during systole and from 6 to 45 cm/s (mean 27.2 +/- 8.3) in early diastole. Systolic flow velocity integrals also exceeded diastolic values. With atrial systole (A wave), forward flow velocities were reduced or flow was reversed. Thirty-nine of 40 subjects had A wave flow reversal during apnea, and in these the ratio of reverse to total forward flow velocity integrals ranged from 1 to 16% (mean 6 +/- 4%). Compared with values during apnea, there were higher mean values with inspiration and lower values with expiration for velocities and flow velocity integrals. Hepatic vein tracings, when adequate (12 of 40 subjects), showed forward flow characteristics similar to those from the superior vena cava, but with more frequent and larger A wave and ventricular end-systole (atrial V wave) flow reversals. Superior vena cava flow velocity variables were calculated in subgroups to assess the effects of age, respiratory pattern and increased venous return. This study defines normal Doppler ultrasound superior vena cava and hepatic vein flow velocities and their variation with respiration in healthy adults. These results can be used for comparison with patterns found in disease states.\r"

  ".W": "Both intraoperative endocardial mapping and surgical ablation for ventricular arrhythmias have until now required a ventriculotomy. Such an incision may be associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality, especially when performed through friable myocardium. A \"closed heart\" technique of intraoperative endocardial mapping and ablation of ventricular arrhythmias was developed in which a balloon array of 112 electrodes was introduced into the left ventricular cavity by a transmitral approach. The array permitted safe delivery of repeated electrical discharges of up to 150 J at each electrode. In four patients with coronary artery disease and no ventricular aneurysm, this \"closed heart\" technique was used to map and treat seven distinct ventricular tachycardias. The time taken to map each tachycardia varied from 3 to 13 minutes. Between 100 and 150 J was then delivered at each of 10 to 42 electrode sites, and the ablation procedure took 7 to 16 minutes per patient to complete. One patient died 24 hours postoperatively from preexisting thrombocytopenic purpura. There was no significant deterioration in left ventricular function in the three survivors and all have remained arrhythmia free, without antiarrhythmic agents, for 4 to 11 months. This technique offers a new method of surgical treatment of ventricular tachycardia without ventriculotomy, and is particularly suited to patients without a discernible left ventricular aneurysm.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the predictive accuracy of two-dimensional echocardiography in the diagnosis of aortic arch obstruction, 540 consecutive patients aged 2 days to 15 years (mean 2 months) who underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization and angiography were prospectively studied. At angiography, 51 patients had aortic arch obstruction; of these, 35 had juxtaductal coarctation, 15 isthmic hypoplasia and 1 a type B interrupted aortic arch. The presence of arch obstruction was correctly identified with two-dimensional echocardiography in 45 of 51 patients with this condition (overall sensitivity 88%). Two-dimensional echocardiography clearly defined a juxtaductal coarctation in 33 of 35 patients and isthmic hypoplasia in 13 of 15 patients (sensitivity 94% and 73%, respectively). The form and type of interrupted aortic arch were clearly distinguished from other forms and types of arch obstruction. Among the 489 patients without aortic arch obstruction, two-dimensional echocardiography wrongly diagnosed the presence of such obstruction in 9 patients (overall specificity 98%). Forty-six (92%) of the 51 patients had at least one associated intracardiac abnormality. Twenty-two (44%) had a ventricular septal defect, 21 (42%) a bicuspid aortic valve and 4 (18%) subaortic stenosis. Five patients had complex congenital cardiac malformations. All associated abnormalities were prospectively identified with two-dimensional echocardiography. Thus, two-dimensional echocardiography is highly specific in diagnosing aortic arch obstruction. It is less sensitive for the diagnosis of isthmic hypoplasia in the neonatal period.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six children, aged 5 weeks to 14.7 years, underwent percutaneous balloon angioplasty for a discrete native coarctation of the aorta. The procedure reduced the systolic coarctation gradient acutely in all children. The mean systolic gradient decreased by 75%, from 48.6 +/- 2.4 before to 12.3 +/- 1.9 mm Hg after angioplasty (p less than 0.001). Long-term results were evaluated in 14 children by follow-up catheterization 12 to 26 months (mean 15.3) after angioplasty. At follow-up, the residual gradient averaged 11.7 +/- 3.7 mm Hg (range -5 to 36) and had not changed from that measured immediately after angioplasty (p = 0.64). Compared with preangioplasty values, the systolic pressure in the ascending aorta had improved substantially at follow-up (116.0 +/- 3.2 versus 143.9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). On the basis of follow-up data, two groups of children were identified: Group 1 consisted of nine children with a good result, defined as a residual gradient less than 20 mm Hg and no aneurysm; Group 2 consisted of five children with a poor result, four with a residual gradient greater than 20 mm Hg (range 25 to 36) and one with an aneurysm at the dilation site. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in age at angioplasty, balloon size, ratio of balloon to isthmus diameters, follow-up duration, heart rate or cardiac output. However, of the four children with a residual gradient greater than 20 mm Hg, two were the youngest in the study, and in two the aorta was inadvertently dilated with a balloon 4 to 5 mm smaller than the isthmus diameter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Three infants developed greatly accelerated junctional ectopic tachycardia with a heart rate greater than 200 beats/min after open heart surgery. When the heart rate exceeded 200 beats/min for 5 hours, all the infants had congestive heart failure and clinical signs of low cardiac output. Conventional therapy (cardioversion, lidocaine, verapamil, digoxin and ice to face) has been shown in the past to be unsuccessful in controlling the heart rate. Because hypothermia is known to decrease automaticity of the heart, these patients were treated with induced hypothermia. The goal was to arbitrarily decrease the junctional ectopic rate to less than 180 beats/min to increase cardiac filling time. The duration of the junctional ectopic tachycardia greater than 180 beats/min ranged from 0.5 to 17 hours after cooling began. The duration of the hypothermia ranged from 4 to 24 hours. Spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm occurred either during the hypothermia or shortly thereafter in all three patients. The blood pressure and urinary output remained stable during hypothermia. Hypothermia is an effective means of controlling the rate of greatly accelerated junctional ectopic tachycardia after open heart surgery in infants. Although hypothermia does not convert junctional ectopic tachycardia to sinus rhythm, it slows the rate to a more acceptable level, allowing the infants' survival and eventual recovery of sinus rhythm.\r"

Coronary abnormalities consist of: 1) total proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery; and 2) partial diversion of coronary artery flow to a segmental pulmonary artery branch. Nonvisualization of the coronary sinus is also noted. Factors other than atherosclerosis may account for total proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Survival is threatened by adverse effects of ongoing ischemic coronary events.\r"

The dogs had been instrumented with an ameroid constrictor and were studied when no regional dysfunction was evident at rest, although severe coronary stenosis or coronary occlusion with collateral circulation development was present. ST segment elevation was measured on subendocardial electrograms, and regional wall motion was studied by sonomicrometry. During control exercise, subendocardial myocardial blood flow in the ischemic zone, normalized to blood flow in the nonischemic zone, decreased. Subendocardial ST elevation increased slowly, was significantly different from control standing values by 2.5 minutes of exercise and returned quickly to control values within 5 minutes after exercise. Percent systolic wall thickening decreased rapidly, was significantly depressed by 1 minute of exercise and did not return to control values until 30 minutes after exercise. A second, identical exercise stress was performed on the same day after a single oral dose (1 mg/kg body weight) of atenolol. In the ischemic zone during exercise after atenolol compared with control exercise, normalized subendocardial myocardial blood flow was improved and significantly less ST elevation occurred, but the onset and resolution of ST elevation were not altered. Systolic wall dysfunction during exercise was significantly less after atenolol, and function returned toward preexercise values by 1 minute after exercise, even more rapidly than ST segment resolution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88034095\r", 
  ".W": "Regional myocardial dysfunction induced by ischemia is associated with less thickening and a larger ventricular radius at end-systole. Thus, end-systolic radius to thickness ratio measured by echocardiography may provide an accurate index of regional left ventricular function that is totally independent of cardiac motion. To test this hypothesis, a total of 14 transient (less than or equal to 10 minutes) coronary artery occlusions (8 left anterior descending, 6 left circumflex) followed by up to 24 hours of reperfusion were performed in six chronically instrumented conscious dogs providing multiple grades of regional ventricular dysfunction. Regional myocardial thickening fraction was determined with epicardial pulsed Doppler probes and served as an independent standard for comparison with simultaneous echocardiographic measurements. End-systolic radius to thickness ratio and radial shortening fraction were derived from the two-dimensional echocardiographic short-axis view along 12 equidistant radii. In the ischemic zone, percent thickening fraction averaged 22 +/- 5% during baseline, decreased to -4 +/- 4% during occlusion with gradual return to baseline after reperfusion. End-systolic radius to thickness ratio averaged 1.39 +/- 0.25 before coronary occlusion and increased to 2.97 +/- 0.48 during occlusion with a gradual return to baseline values. A significant correlation was found between Doppler-determined thickening fraction measurements and echocardiographic end-systolic radius to thickness ratio as well as radial shortening fraction for absolute values (r = -0.83 and 0.75, respectively; n = 65) and percent change from baseline (r = -0.86 and 0.78, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cardiac receptor binding sites (alpha-1-, beta- and calcium antagonists) were studied in early (21 days old) and late (70 days old) stages of cardiomyopathy. The effects of verapamil on histologic features and free radicals in the heart were studied. The number of alpha-1- and beta-cardiac receptor binding sites was significantly greater in the late stage of cardiomyopathy when compared with findings in normal golden hamsters used as controls. The calcium antagonist receptors were significantly increased in the early stage but alpha-1- and beta-receptors were not. Verapamil-treated hamsters received intraperitoneal injections of verapamil at a dose of 5 mg/kg per day for 70 days from age 20 days. The percent areas of fibrosis and calcification in the verapamil-treated group were significantly smaller than those in the control group. The concentrations of lipid peroxides in the whole heart and free radicals in the heart mitochondria were significantly higher in the cardiomyopathic hamsters, and verapamil inhibited the increase in free radical concentration in the hearts of these hamsters. This study confirms that the number of calcium channels is increased early in the course of cardiomyopathy in the Bio 14.6 Syrian hamster. A larger number of free radicals may participate in the accumulation of calcium and cell injury in the myocytes of these hamsters. Verapamil protects against myocardial damage and may do so by inhibiting voltage-dependent calcium uptake and by preventing cell injury from free radicals.\r"

There were 16 episodes of acute inferior wall ischemia, and the response to therapy was judged by evaluating blood pressure and ST segment and T wave abnormalities. Three patients received intravenous isosorbide dinitrate and two received streptokinase as the initial therapy. The mean ST segment elevation was significantly reduced (from 4.94 +/- 1 to 0.5 +/- 0.7 [p less than 0.0001]) after metaraminol infusion was initiated. The average T wave height also decreased (from 6.8 +/- 2 to -1.3 +/- 2.5 mm [p less than 0.0005]). The average heart rate decreased from 82 +/- 11 to 69 +/- 9 beats/min (p less than 0.05) and the mean arterial blood pressure increased from 81 +/- 12 mm Hg before metaraminol treatment to 126 +/- 8 mm Hg after treatment. All these changes occurred within a few minutes after metaraminol therapy was instituted. In 12 episodes, accelerated idioventricular rhythm appeared concomitantly with the resolution of ST segment elevation. Coronary angiography performed between 4 and 10 days after admission demonstrated significant obstruction in all infarct-related arteries, but none was totally occluded. Left ventricular function was normal in three patients and slightly hypokinetic in the inferior wall in two. These results indicate that in a selected group of patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction, metaraminol administration (in certain hemodynamic circumstances) can alleviate acute ischemia within a few minutes and thereby reduce ischemic injury.\r"

Ventricular tachycardia could no longer be induced in 7 (35%) of the 20 patients studied with combination therapy. This was a significantly higher proportion of patients than that of the groups responding to either monotherapy (quinidine, 10%; mexiletine, 5%). Ventricular effective and functional refractory periods were measured when applying single (S2), double (S3) and triple (S4) extrastimuli. Quinidine monotherapy increased functional and effective refractory periods of both single and multiple extrastimuli. However, when comparing measurements made during mexiletine treatment with those at baseline, mexiletine monotherapy increased only the refractory periods of S4. The effective refractory period of S4 during mexiletine monotherapy (200 +/- 20 ms) was significantly longer than at baseline (160 +/- 21 ms). Similarly, when comparing measurements made during combination therapy with those during quinidine monotherapy, combination therapy significantly increased the refractory periods only of multiple extrastimuli.

  ".U": "88034108\r", 
  ".W": "Although left ventricular function is generally regarded as a key determinant of prognosis in aortic regurgitation, predictors of outcome of aortic valve replacement based on this factor have recently been questioned. This study was performed to examine the role of indexes of left ventricular function in predicting the outcome of surgery in patients with aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction. Fourteen patients with aortic regurgitation with a preoperative ejection fraction of less than 0.55 (average 0.45 +/- 0.02) who underwent aortic valve replacement were studied. The patients had 82 (58%) of a possible 140 predictors of negative outcome preoperatively, but 12 of the 14 patients had a decrease in symptoms and an increase in ejection fraction into the normal range after operation (average postoperative ejection fraction 0.59 +/- 0.04). Although improvement occurred despite the presence of many negative predictors of outcome, there was a significant correlation between postoperative ejection fraction and eight of the tested preoperative predictors. Preoperative end-systolic dimension correlated best (r = -0.91) with postoperative ejection fraction. An end-systolic dimension of 60 mm correlated with a postoperative ejection fraction of 0.55. The results indicate that preoperative ventricular function is still an important determinant of outcome of aortic valve replacement for aortic regurgitation. However, current medical and surgical techniques permit a better prognosis in the presence of reduced ventricular function than was previously considered possible.\r"

Therefore, urinary excretion of their major metabolites, 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 and 2,3-dinor-6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, was studied in 16 patients presenting with prolonged angina at rest. The 10 patients whose condition did not improve under vigorous antianginal treatment within 48 hours exhibited higher thromboxane metabolite excretion than did the 6 patients who responded to therapy (2,208 +/- 1,542 versus 609 +/- 312 ng/g creatinine; p less than 0.001). Elevated values were also found in four of eight patients with sustained postinfarction angina. Enhanced thromboxane metabolite excretion was frequently associated with angiographic evidence of thrombus formation. When nine patients were restudied in a stable phase after 11 +/- 5 months, thromboxane metabolite excretion was consistently normal or high normal. Excretion of prostacyclin metabolites was not depressed in any patient but correlated weakly with thromboxane (r = 0.41). Thus, enhanced thromboxane production as an index of platelet activation may identify patients with active thrombus formation who could benefit most from platelet inhibitory treatment.\r"

Urinary-free cortisol output during the second 24 hours of the alternate-day prednisone regimen were similar to values among patients receiving inhaled beclomethasone and were significantly lower than among control subjects for both groups. Mean heights among patients before being placed on maintenance corticosteroids were at the thirty-fifth percentile and were similar for both regimens. This was significantly lower than initial measurements for control subjects who, on average, were near the fiftieth percentile for both children with asthma not requiring maintenance corticosteroids and normal healthy Iowa children. Mean heights for both corticosteroid-treated groups remained at the thirty-fifth percentile after more than a 2-year average duration of follow-up. Heights of children with chronic asthma not requiring maintenance corticosteroids were initially significantly higher (fifty-first percentile) than the patients who subsequently required maintenance corticosteroids and increased significantly to the sixty-first percentile during a mean 2.7-year follow-up. Heights of healthy Iowa children remained near the fiftieth percentile during a mean 7-year follow-up. Disproportionate weight gain, although it was not consistently present, was significantly more likely with the alternate-day prednisone. Other extrapulmonary effects of the corticosteroid regimens appeared not to be of clinical importance during the time period of the study.\r"

The factor is stable at 56 degrees C and has a molecular weight in the 10,000 to 30,000 dalton range. The magnitude of HREF activity produced is dependent on the concentration of mononuclear cells cultured and the final concentration of HREF during basophil challenge. The HREF phenomenon could not be attributed to phytohemagglutinin, alpha- or gamma-interferon, arachidonic acid metabolites, or interleukin-1 or 2. HREF appears to be a unique cytokine of potential importance in the immunology of inflammatory and atopic processes.\r"

Lectins from pea, broad bean, lentil, jack bean, soybean, peanut, and wheat germ were coupled to RAST discs. The discs were pretreated with lectin-specific sugars in an attempt to inhibit RAST with sera from 11 sensitive patients. In all cases, RAST was almost unaffected by the inhibitory sugars, indicating that nonimmune binding of IgE by lectins in legume or wheat RAST was not significant when RAST was carried out with allergens bound to the usual paper discs. IgE contains binding sites for all the lectins examined, and five of the sera had high total IgE greater than 300 IU/ml. It is suggested that competition by IgG and other serum glycoproteins may explain the lack of effect by the added sugars. All sera contained endogenous glucose at a level of about 3 mmol/L that may have accounted for some self-inhibition of the lectin binding by pea, broad bean, lentil, and jack bean lectins. There was, however, significant immune binding of some of the lectins by specific IgE, and it is concluded that these lectins may be important in expression of IgE-mediated allergic responses.\r"

It was found to be an acidic protein with isoelectric point 3.8 and molecular weight of 14,300.

In the crossed immunoelectrophoresis reference pattern of the whole pollen extract, 37 precipitin lines could be identified on the anodic side, whereas Artemisia VI b could be observed as a single precipitin line. Immunologically, the whole pollen extract of A. scoparia demonstrated shared antigenic and allergenic determinants with Ageratum conyzoides-pollen extract. The use of fast protein liquid chromatography in partial purification of allergenic components is also discussed.\r"

An INH conjugate with bovine serum albumin was also used in the prick tests alone. All preparations caused rapid positive skin reaction in the patient. Prausnitz-Kustner tests on the subject's mother were also rapidly positive. Furthermore, positive results were obtained not only in the inhalation tests with the three antigens but also in the environmental provocation tests. These results strongly suggested that the asthmatic symptoms of the subject were not caused by physical irritation from INH or other drugs and might be mediated by an IgE antibody specific to INH, a suggestion subsequently confirmed by in vitro enzyme-linked allergosorbent test for the antibody previously reported. This is the first precise description of INH-induced bronchial asthma, and the four kinds of INH preparations used in these tests might be very useful as tools of clinical diagnosis in INH allergy.\r"

Prick skin testing and RAST were performed with whole body extracts (1:20 wt/vol) of AC, brown-banded (BB), and GC species as well as hemolymph and fecal (F) extracts of AC. Three of six workers reported work-related nasal and ocular symptoms associated with xenografting and bleeding of cockroaches. All three symptomatic workers exhibited cutaneous reactivity to at least one cockroach antigen. Elevated RAST binding was observed in one of the three symptomatic workers. A nasal provocation to AC was positive in the most symptomatic worker at a provocative dose of 3.2 X 10(-3) mg causing a 50% decrease of nasal flow rate from baseline. After pretreatment with nasal cromolyn, the provocative dose causing a 50% decrease from baseline increased to 2.6 X 10(-1) mg. Nasal provocation with the same concentrations of AC were negative in two skin test negative subjects. RAST-inhibition studies demonstrated cross inhibition of the serum-specific IgE binding to AC-hemolymph by AC, GC, and BB whole body extracts. However, specific IgE binding to AC-F was inhibited by AC-F and AC but not by GC or BB whole body extracts, suggesting there was greater specificity of the F allergens. This study demonstrated that cockroach allergens elicit IgE-dependent upper respiratory sensitization in the workplace.\r"

Biopsy specimens were obtained before application of the stimulus and at the time of lesion formation. Patients with cold-induced urticaria exhibited morphological alterations only after stimulus application consisting of enlargement and uniform disorganization of some, but not all, granules, fusion of the membranes of adjacent granules, fusion of granule membranes with mast cell membranes, and discharge of electron-lucent and disorganized granule contents into the extracellular space. Mast cells from patients with immediate as well as delayed dermographism exhibited alterations before and after stimulus application consisting of enlargement of most granules, nonuniform (zonal) disorganization or solubilization of granule contents, fusion of granule membranes with mast cell membranes, and extracellular discharge of granule contents. Small cytoplasmic vesicles containing disorganized granular material were associated with the degranulation process. Endothelial cells lining nearby postcapillary venules exhibited prominent perinuclear condensation of contractile microfilaments during degranulation in both groups. Both before and after application of the stimulus, the walls of the superficial dermal vessels of the patients with dermographism were thinner and contained less extracellular matrix material than vessel walls of the patients with cold-induced urticaria. The morphologically distinctive types of mast cell degranulation that characterize these two clinically separable urticarial disorders may indicate different pathogenic mechanisms of lesion formation.\r"

  ".W": "A liquid-phase, antigen-binding radioimmunoassay measuring subclass IgG4 antibody (ab) to allergens has been developed. This assay, which uses monoclonal anti-IgG4 to bind IgG4, allows direct comparison of class (IgG)- and subclass (IgG4)-specific ab levels. These assays used radiolabeled purified allergens, Der p I (Ag P1) from the dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Lol p I (Rye 1), from ryegrass pollen, hen's egg ovalbumin, and beta-lactoglobulin from cow's milk. We have investigated IgG4 abs in several clinical situations. The results confirm that IgG ab responses to both inhalants and food proteins unequivocally include IgG4 ab. On average, the proportion of IgG4 ab to these antigens is far higher than the contribution of IgG4 to total IgG. In patients with adult atopic dermatitis, levels of both class and subclass ab were higher than in control subjects; however, the ratio of IgG4:IgG varied widely in patients and control subjects. During desensitization treatment of patients with perennial rhinitis, levels of IgG4 ab to Der p 1 increased sharply, but there were also increases in the total IgG ab responses so that the percentage contribution of IgG4 was only moderately increased (mean values: before, 29%; after, 36%). In a prospective study of children from atopic families, IgG4 abs to food proteins were detectable as early as 3 months. IgG abs to hen's egg ovalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin from cow's milk increased to a maximum at 3 years and declined by 5 years. However, specific IgG4 as a percentage of specific IgG increased progressively from a mean value of approximately 15% at 6 months to approximately 50% at 5 years of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The largest variations from the time standard were in processing-heating hot vegetables, while the greatest temperature variations were across all process steps for entrees. Deviations from recommended time and temperature standards for handling of milk were significantly correlated with lower consumption of milk.\r"

Six treatment combinations of three cooking temperatures (105 degrees C, 135 degrees C, and 165 degrees C) and two holding conditions (not chilled and chilled for 24 hours) were studied. Turkey rolls from each treatment combination were subjected to three hot-holding times (0, 60, and 120 minutes). Electrical energy usage was monitored during heat processing of the turkey rolls, reheating the turkey slices, and hot holding the turkey slices. Aroma, juicy mouthfeel, texture, flavor, and flavor off-notes of the cooked turkey were evaluated by seven judges using 150-mm unstructured line scales. Chew counts also were recorded. Turkey cooked at 105 degrees C took significantly more time to cook (331 vs. 227 and 203 minutes) but consumed significantly less energy (3.4 vs. 3.8 and 4.5 kWh) than turkey rolls cooked at 135 degrees C and 165 degrees C, respectively. Significantly higher juicy mouthfeel scores were obtained when the turkey roll was cooked in the convection oven at an oven temperature of 105 degrees C, the turkey was not chilled, and the slices were held hot for 60 minutes or less.\r"

  ".W": "Documentation of nutrition counseling effectiveness is essential to reinforce its value in an era of escalating health care costs. Counseling effectiveness can be determined definitively only if dietary assessment is made both before and after intervention. Unfortunately, methods currently available have drawbacks that limit feasibility of routine use. A directly computer-readable Quantitative Food Frequency Analysis method, which eliminates the need for manual data entry, has been developed and instituted at the University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, for outpatient counseling. A 1-hour interview, focusing upon \"usual\" intake, is conducted using pictorial menus for food items. Feedback is available to the patient and health care team immediately. The data base is derived from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Food Table; the intake of 61 nutrients, including 23 fatty acids, is computed. The computer printout consists of four components: a summary; an alert for foods high in fat, cholesterol, sucrose, alcohol, and/or sodium; a listing of all foods consumed by frequency, accompanied by their nutrient contribution to daily intake; and a bar graph relating current nutrient intake to recommended levels. This document serves as a counseling tool and can support claims for third-party payment.\r"

Three-day individual food intake data from male and female heads of household were used when both members participated in the spring quarter of the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey 1977-78. The mean percentage of energy from fat was higher for male heads than for female heads, whereas the mean percentages of energy from protein and carbohydrate were higher for female heads than for male heads (p less than .05). However, the differences between male and female heads in percentages of energy from protein, fat, and carbohydrate were only 1.5 percentage points or less. At the current state of knowledge, that difference is too small to be associated with a difference in health status. In diet/disease studies involving percentages of energy from protein, fat, and carbohydrate, substitution of dietary data of one partner for data of the other partner does not appear likely to produce misleading results and, therefore, would not be precluded. Mean intakes of energy and all 12 nutrients examined as percentages of the RDAs differed significantly between male heads and female heads (p less than .05). In studies involving intakes of energy or any of the 12 nutrients examined, substitution of dietary data of one partner for data of the other partner is not recommended.\r"

Nutrition education was part of the distant environment for the family practice resident, rather than in the foreground. Nutrition education should be part of the scheduled activities of residents, so that they do not have to borrow time from patient care and other obligations. Then, the residents could devote their full attention to nutrition and see its importance as equivalent to that of other subspecialties.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was conducted in a nursing home among elderly residents treated with and without indwelling catheters. Most of the patients were white females with a mean age of 82.3 years. The mortality at 6 months among catheterized patients was 30.2% compared with 10.1% among the noncatheterized groups (P less than 0.001). Patients with catheters differed significantly from those without in having more impaired mental status and diminished activities of daily living. They also differed significantly for eight of 30 diseases. Cerebrovascular and hypertensive disease were significantly more common in catheterized patients. In contrast, fractures and musculoskeletal disorders were significantly more common among noncatheterized patients. Catheterized patients had significantly more days with fever and symptomatic urinary tract infections and received antibiotics more often than did noncatheterized patients. We conclude that: (1) direct comparisons of morbidity and mortality among catheterized and noncatheterized populations are not valid because of confounding by the presence of associated life-threatening illnesses; and (2) catheterized patients have more clinical episodes of urinary tract infections and fever and are treated more frequently with antibiotics.\r"

For these patients, ages ranged from 63 to 102 years (mean, 81 years). The patients received a range of 1 to 11 regularly scheduled medications (mean, 5.6 medications). Duration of cimetidine treatment averaged 19.6 months for 48 patients (81%) receiving the drug for longer than an eight-week course of therapy. Prescribing indications appeared unjustified in 54 of 60 patients (90%). Doses were rarely appropriately reduced for patient age, despite established reasons to do so and the well-known potential for adverse effects of cimetidine in the elderly. The risks associated with prolonged drug-induced suppression of gastric acid are not known. This study suggests that use of cimetidine without justifiable indication and for extended periods of time is common in nursing home patients. Studies are needed concerning the safety of long-term cimetidine use in elderly patients.\r"

Four age groups were compared: under 55, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 years of age and over. Severity of illness and prior health were assessed using the Acute Physiology Score (APS) and the Chronic Health Evaluation (CHE) instruments. Resource utilization was assessed using the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) and hospital charges. Patients 65 years of age and over comprised 48% of the MICU sample. The distribution of CHE was different among the four groups. Twenty-one percent of patients under 55 years of age had no prior chronic illness, as compared to less than 8% of older patients. The APS at admission was similar for all age groups, as was admission, daily, and total TISS. Hospital survival declined with age from 85% to 70%, while the likelihood of being designated do not resuscitate (DNR) increased from 10% to 24%. Differences in hospital survival disappeared when controlling for severity of illness and prior health, but differences in DNR status did not. Still, elderly DNR patients received as much resources as younger DNR patients and this was more than non-DNR patients. The sample of patients treated on conventional medical divisions had age distribution similar to the MICU sample. There was some evidence that admission APS (median, 5, 5, 6, 6, respectively, P = .055) and maximum APS (median, 5, 5, 7, 8, respectively, P = .023) differed slightly across age groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possibility of substituting a subset of items from the widely used Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for the entire examination in order to reduce the time needed to screen for cognitive status. Study data came from a health study of 783 community-dwelling, white females, 65 years of age and over, selected randomly from a 20-census-tract area of northeast Baltimore. Results indicate that seven MMSE items can be used to reliably predict total MMSE scores. Because of an age X education interaction in the prediction of total MMSE scores, four age X education-specific predictive equations were developed. These four equations are most useful for predicting continuous MMSE scores rather than for categorizing individuals according to impaired versus unimpaired status. A short form of the MMSE and four age X education-specific scoring equations are presented and their potential utility discussed.\r"

After immunization with either type of antigen, the kinetics of the rheumatoid factor response reflected the kinetics of the dominant IgG isotype in the anti-antigen response. Secondary immunization with protein antigens induced an IgM rheumatoid factor response which was consistently greater than that seen after carbohydrate immunization, and almost exclusively specific for the IgG1 isotype. In contrast, primary or hyperimmunization with carbohydrate antigens gave rise to a more heterogeneous response dominated by IgM anti-IgG3, with lesser amounts of IgM anti-IgG2b and anti-IgG1. Direct immunization with immune complexes gave similar results, as complexes composed of IgG1 induced exclusively IgM anti-IgG1, whereas those complexes made up of IgG3 gave rise to IgM rheumatoid factors binding IgG3 and IgG2b. Rheumatoid factor production, with isotypic specificity defined by the immunizing antigen, appears to be a natural consequence of immunization with a variety of protein and carbohydrate antigens.\r"

The peptide was analogous to amino acid sequences 735 to 752 from the human T cell leukemia virus-IIIB isolate of HIV. Characteristics of the anti-Id preparation included: 1) detection of a shared determinant present on a second chimpanzee and one of three rabbit antibody preparations directed against the synthetic peptide, 2) failure to recognize an idiotype (Id) in BALB/c mouse antisera to the peptide, and 3) partial inhibition of the homologous chimpanzee Id preparation from binding either peptide or a recombinant HIV gp160 preparation. Immunization of BALB/c mice with the anti-Id induced an antipeptide response which bound a recombinant gp160 preparation without subsequent peptide or gp160 exposure. The anti-gp160 containing sera from mice immunized with anti-Id were able to inhibit the Id-anti-Id reaction indicating that an Id-positive antibody response was induced. This Id is not normally expressed in the murine anti-gp 160 immune response to the synthetic peptide and suggests that this anti-Id may activate normally silent clones. This study indicates that Id networks may be operational during the immune response to HIV epitopes. Alternatively, anti-Id may be useful in altering the serologic characteristics of an antibody response to HIV and may offer potential for modulating the immune response in this viral infection.\r"

Activation with PMA resulted in a dose-dependent increase in binding of fluorescein-labeled (FL)-casein and (FL-FMLPL) over the range of PMA concentrations from 0.5 to 50 ng/ml. In contrast, activation of PMN with PMA resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in FL-C5a binding, and activation with concentrations above 5 ng/ml resulted in a complete loss of binding. This loss of binding was not caused by inactivation of the ligand or prevented by the addition of superoxide dismutase and catalase or protease inhibitors. Furthermore, incubation of PMN with supernatants from PMN stimulated to degranulate did not reduce the availability of C5a receptors. This pattern of increased FMLPL and casein binding with decreased C5a binding was also observed with cytochalasin B-pretreated PMN that were stimulated with chemotactic factors. Parallel studies of superoxide anion generation demonstrated that PMA-treated PMN were still responsive to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, but not to C5a. These data demonstrate that the activation of PMN up-regulates formyl peptide and casein receptors whereas C5a receptors are down-regulated under similar conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Recent observations support an active role for the vascular endothelial cell in the induction and evolution of the inflammatory response. Since prior studies suggested that cultured bovine endothelial cells express high affinity binding sites for the neutrophil chemotactic oligopeptide formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-Met-Leu-Phe), we sought to further characterize the interaction between formyl peptide chemoattractants and human vascular endothelial cells. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and peripheral blood neutrophils specifically bound f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe, whereas specific binding to cultured fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and epithelial cells was negligible. Endothelial cells expressed 3.6 +/- 0.7 X 10(5) binding sites/cell with a Kd of 210 +/- 31 nM. Although the hexapeptide formyl norleucyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-norleucyl-tyrosyl-lysine (f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys) and the tetrapeptide f-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys completed with f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe for binding to endothelial cells, specific binding of 125I-f-Nl-Leu-Phe-Tyr-Lys or f-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein to endothelial cells was not observed, suggesting that steric constraints on formyl peptide binding differ between endothelial cells and leukocytes. At 37 degrees C, cell-associated f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe greatly exceeded that bound at 0 degrees C and was incorporated predominantly into a nondisplaceable compartment. Release of f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe or radioactive breakdown products from this compartment was time- and temperature-dependent with a t1/2 of approximately equal to 20 min at 37 degrees C. Resolution of the radioactive products released from f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe-loaded endothelial cells by thin layer chromatography indicated that greater than or equal to 57% of the released material co-migrated with intact f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe. Degradative release was blocked by agents that interfere with lysosomal acidification. The radioactive material released from f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe-loaded endothelial cells bound specifically to neutrophils. This binding was inhibited 50.2 +/- 6.4% by a greater than or equal to 10(3)-fold excess of nonradioactive f-Met-Leu-Phe whereas binding of authentic f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe was inhibited 89.4 +/- 3.0%. Supernatant obtained from f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe-loaded endothelial cells elicited a rise in neutrophil cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) measured by quin2 fluorescence. The change in neutrophil [Ca2+]i depended on ligand binding to the neutrophil formyl peptide receptor since endothelial supernatants were devoid of activity in the presence of the f-Met-Leu-Phe antagonist, tert-butoxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we investigated the effect of C-I on human PMN chemotaxis to C5a, f-Met-Leu-Phe, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and fluoresceinated N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-lysine (f-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-FITC). PMN, preincubated for 5 min at 37 degrees C with 0 to 200 microM C-I, were tested for their migratory responses to the chemoattractants. C-I (greater than or equal to 1 microM) significantly inhibited PMN chemotaxis to f-Met-Leu-Phe, f-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-FITC, and C5a without affecting random migration. Maximal inhibition of chemotaxis to these attractants occurred with greater than or equal to 50 microM C-I, at which chemotaxis was inhibited by 80 to 95%. The C-I inhibition was reversible. In contrast, 200 microM C-I did not inhibit the number of PMN migrating to LTB4, although, the leading front of PMN migration to LTB4 was inhibited by C-I. C-I inhibited PMN orientation to C5a and f-Met-Leu-Phe without affecting orientation to LTB4. C-I did not inhibit the binding of radiolabeled f-Met-Leu-Phe or f-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-FITC to PMN. These findings suggest that the chemotactic responses of PMN to f-Met-Leu-Phe and C5a involve a protein kinase-dependent reaction which is inhibited by C-I.\r"

Three polypeptide fragments were purified by slab gel electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide followed by electroelution. The purified fragments migrated as 28-, 25-, and 23.5-kDa fragments, respectively. Each of the fragments inhibited opsonization of a diluted antiserum prepared in rabbits by immunization with whole type 1 streptococci. The amino-terminal sequences of the peptide fragments were confirmed by comparison with the primary structure predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the type 1 M protein structural gene. The 28-kDa fragment contained the NH2-terminal asparagine residue of the processed type 1 M protein, whereas the NH2-terminal sequences of the 25- and 23.5-kDa peptides began at residues 27 and 36, respectively. A seven-residue periodicity with respect to polar and nonpolar residues was observed beginning at residue 22 and, therefore, the secondary structural potential of type 1 M protein is similar to that reported for other M proteins. In contrast to the other M proteins, however, identical repeats were rare, the longest sequence identity consisting of a three-amino acid acid sequence Lys-Asp-Leu at positions 30-32 repeated once at positions 65-67. A 23-residue synthetic peptide of the amino-terminus of the type 1 M protein evoked opsonic antibodies against type 1 streptococci. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal region of type 1 M protein retains the secondary structural characteristics of other M serotypes. Moreover, it contains epitopes that evoke protective immune responses. Our studies may have bearing in the development of safe and effective vaccines against group A streptococcal infections.\r"

  ".W": "The recent development of a method for culturing the parasitic form of Coccidioides immitis by using conditions compatible with the growth of lymphoid cells has enabled us to investigate the role of natural killer (NK) cells in defense against this pathogenic fungus. Pure cultures of spherules and endospores were grown in RPMI 1640 which contained 10% calf serum. Single cell suspensions of young spherules and endospores were incubated in the presence of freshly isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). After a 4-hr incubation, the colony-forming ability of the fungus was significantly reduced. Leu-11 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the Fc receptor of NK cells. When PBL were incubated in the presence of this monoclonal antibody and complement, the colony-forming ability of C. immitis was not reduced, indicating that the effector cell involved in reduction of colony-forming units is also recognized by the Leu-11 monoclonal antibody. Classical NK activity can be enhanced by preincubation with interferon; the inhibitory activity of the PBL which are responsible for the reduction in colony-forming units of C. immitis is similarly enhanced by pretreatment with interferon. When PBL are incubated in the presence of young spherules and endospores for 24 hr, the cellfree supernatants will kill U937 target cells. In addition to stimulating the release of NK cytotoxic factor, C. immitis is susceptible to inactivation when incubated in the presence of factors released by PBL which have been incubated in the presence of either K562 or C. immitis. Other evidence reported by this laboratory demonstrates that C-reactive protein is present on the surface of NK cells and that antibody to this molecule blocks NK-mediated killing of standard tumor cell targets. Pretreatment with anti-C-reactive protein also blocks the ability of PBL to inhibit the colony-forming capacity of this fungus. These data suggest that the cell that inhibits the in vitro growth of the pathogenic fungus, C. immitis, is an NK cell.\r"

  ".U": "88034406\r", 
  ".W": "Natural killer cytotoxic factor (NKCF) is produced as a result of the interaction of murine, rat, or human natural killer (NK) cells with NK-susceptible targets. This factor has been linked to the target cell lysis mediated by the NK effector cell. In the present results, culture supernatants from rat large granular lymphocyte (LGL) tumors exhibited NKCF activity which lysed the susceptible targets, MBL-2 and YAC-1. NKCF production from these rat tumor lines was spontaneous and was not significantly increased by co-incubation of the LGL tumors with target cells, target cell membranes, or by preincubation of the LGL tumor cells with interferon or interleukin 2. In addition to NKCF activity, the supernatants lysed L929, indicating the presence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in these preparations. The presence of this latter cytokine was verified using specific antibodies to recombinant murine TNF which neutralized the L929 activity while not affecting the NKCF activity against MBL-2 or YAC-1. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) A0287, A0462, and A0316) which significantly inhibit the NKCF cytolytic activity of these LGL-derived supernatants were also produced. These antibodies were shown to cross-react with human NKCF in a manner similar to that seen in the rat. Interestingly these same mAb demonstrated no inhibition of L929 cytotoxicity from either LGL-derived supernatants or by recombinant murine or human TNF. To examine further the specificity of these antibodies, they were chemically linked to Sepharose 4B and found to remove a significant proportion of the NKCF cytolytic activity from LGL supernatants, while not affecting the TNF reactivities in these preparations. In addition, these antibodies demonstrated significant inhibition of cell-mediated cytotoxicity by rat LGL against YAC-1 target cells. Biochemical analysis of labeled NKCF-containing supernatants indicated the major protein recognized by these anti-NKCF mAb to be approximately 12,000 m.w. The use of these mAb against NKCF should be very useful in further purification and biochemical characterization of NKCF and in studying its role in a variety of cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays.\r"

Clone B10, specific for the viral coat m.w. 70,000 glycoprotein, could be rapidly activated in situ after local transfer with intact tumor cells in syngeneic hosts to produce a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. For ACIT, mice bearing 5-day-old tumors received cyclophosphamide followed by transfer of resting helper T lymphocyte clones with or without exogenous interleukin 2 (rIL-2). A single injection of clone B10 was effective in ACIT when followed by a short course of exogenous rIL-2. Alternatively, repeated injections of resting clone were also effective without exogenous rIL-2, suggesting that the major role for rIL-2 was prolongation of clone survival in vivo rather than activation of other effector cells. Clone F12, specific for a component of fetal calf serum, was not effective in ACIT either with or without rIL-2, even when administered under conditions known to result in clone activation. Thus, antigen-specific helper T lymphocyte clones are capable of activation and promotion of antitumor responses after adoptive transfer.\r"

  ".W": "A mouse monoclonal antibody M2590, previously established after immunization of mice (C57BL/6) with syngeneic melanoma B16 cells and showing preferential reactivity with various types of melanoma over other tumor and normal cells or tissues, was shown to be directed to GM3 ganglioside. Since GM3 is widely distributed in essentially all types of animal cells, there is a conflict with the concept of a tumor-associated antigen and immunogen. Studies on the reactivity of M2590 antibody with various cells having different GM3 density at their cell surface, including cells treated with sialidase, liposomes, and solid-phase lipid layer containing different GM3 concentrations, have indicated that 1) reactivity of the antibody M2590 depends greatly on the density of GM3 exposed at the cell surface, on liposomes, or on solid phase; and 2) there is a threshold density that is recognized by the antibody in all-or-none fashion. In addition, the antibody M2590 reacts not only with GM3 but also with GM3 lactone, and the binding affinity of the antibody to GM3 lactone is strikingly higher than to GM3; however, the antibody does not react with GM3 ethyl ester. GM3 lactone was detected in melanoma as 3H-labeled GM3 gangliosidol after melanoma cells were directly treated with NaB[3H]4. A comparative immunization of BALB/c mice with GM3 and GM3 lactone showed that GM3 lactone is a much stronger immunogen than GM3, although the antibody elicited reacts with both GM3 and its lactone. Thus, the real immunogen could be GM3 lactone, although it is a minor membrane component.\r"

To investigate this, we have measured the rate of transit from the proliferative to the terminally differentiating compartment in confluent low-calcium cultures of normal epidermal keratinocytes, using involucrin as a marker of terminal differentiation. We estimate a rate of transit of 3.58 cells/5000 cells/h and a differentiation probability of 0.017, indicating a bias toward self-renewal. Surprisingly, some cells in culture synthesized DNA and expressed involucrin simultaneously. In psoriatic plaques, involucrin expression begins closer to the basal layer than in normal epidermis, and here too we found S-phase involucrin-positive cells. We also observed occasional mitotic involucrin-positive cells in psoriatic epidermis, although we were unable to detect them in culture. Our experiments show that temporal separation of proliferation and terminal differentiation is not obligatory, and thus, the kinetic organization of epidermis may be less rigid than some models imply.\r"

The aim of this study was to follow the pathway of granule formation in MC. Four compartments, the cis and trans Golgi cisternae, the condensing granules in the Golgi stacks, the bristle-coated granules, and the noncoated granules, are observed by transmission electron microscopy in MC. This suggests that: (1) the organelles usually involved in the formation of secretory polypeptides are present in the cytoplasm of MC; (2) the pathway of Merkel cell granule (MCG) formation appears to be similar to that of secretory endocrine or exocrine cells; and (3) MC might be involved in a secretory process.\r"

The average values of maximum granular diameter (GD = 69.1 nm) and area (GA = 3637.8 mm2) of NS granules measured in the adult NE Merkel cells stained with UR are significantly greater than those (GD = 61.4 nm; GA = 2699.8 nm2) seen in the fetal NE Merkel cells also stained with UR.

When triacontanol-containing compounds were solubilized in aqueous media, effects on lymphocytes were insignificant. When solubilized in ethanol, there was a marked effect on thymidine uptake but not on blast transformation when compared to parallel controls.\r"

These mechanisms are apparent in all human diffuse reflectance spectra that we have collected. We show that the absorber is the same in all human volunteer skin samples. By studying the diffuse reflection spectra of DOPA-melanin in solution and DOPA-melanin in powder form, we find that we can correlate the absorption mechanisms, one with melanin in solution (a low molecular weight form) and the other with melanin in powder (a high molecular weight form). Therefore, we propose that melanin exists in two distinct states. This model is of biologic significance, as it provides a reasonable interpretation for the diffuse reflection spectra obtained from delayed pigment (UVB-induced) and immediate pigment (UVA-induced). Delayed pigment appears as an increase of both forms of melanin (neomelanogenesis), whereas immediate pigment appears as an increase in the higher molecular weight form with a commensurate decrease in the lower molecular weight form: the two mechanisms change independently of each other. Finally, we show that we can distinguish spectroscopically between the delayed pigment and the immediate pigment.\r"

Epidermolysis bullosa patients treated with diphenylhydantoin had lower levels of arachidonic acid in plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids than did untreated EB patients. Parents of children with the recessive dystrophic or junctional EB subtypes had higher linoleic and arachidonic acids in plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids than did controls. Plasma and erythrocyte total lipids were within the normal range in children with EB. Plasma zinc was also normal but plasma copper was elevated in children with recessive dystrophic EB. We conclude that higher arachidonic acid in plasma and erythrocytes may be related to the pathology of EB.\r"

  ".U": "88034486\r", 
  ".W": "The enzymatically catalyzed formation of 4-hydroxyproline plays a key role in the intracellular biosynthesis of collagen, since a critical number of 4-hydroxyprolyl residues is required for synthesis and secretion of triple-helical procollagen molecules under physiologic conditions. The enzyme catalyzing the conversion of prolyl residues to 4-hydroxyproline, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, requires ferrous ion, alpha-ketoglutarate, and ascorbate for its activity. 3,4-Dihydroxybenzoic acid has been known to act as potent competitive inhibitor of purified prolyl 4-hydroxylase with respect to one or several of the cofactors or cosubstrates of the enzyme. 3,4-Dihydroxybenzoic acid, however, is a poor inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylation in intact cells, probably due to its polarity not allowing it to enter the cells. In this study, several hydrophobic modifications of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid were tested in human skin fibroblast cultures for their efficacy to inhibit the synthesis of 4-hydroxyproline. The results indicated that the ethyl ester of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was an efficient inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylation in fibroblast cultures, with Ki of approximately 0.4 mM. Ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate had little, if any, effect on the hydroxylation of lysyl residues, and it did not affect total protein synthesis or DNA replication in these cells. To test the hypothesis that ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate might serve as a potential antifibrotic agent, its efficacy in inhibiting prolyl hydroxylation in scleroderma fibroblasts was also tested. The results indicated that the synthesis of 4-hydroxyproline in scleroderma cell cultures was similarly reduced by ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate. Thus, structural analogs of the cofactors or cosubstrates of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, such as ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate tested here or its further modifications, may serve as inhibitors of posttranslational hydroxylation of prolyl residues also in vivo. These compounds could potentially provide a novel means of reducing collagen deposition in tissues in fibrotic diseases, such as scleroderma.\r"

The development of such compounds has been impeded by the absence of a clinically relevant animal model for evaluating their efficacy. This report describes the development and use of such a laboratory animal system. Selected concentrations of oxybenzone (2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone) in vehicle (0.1% to 6%) or vehicle alone were applied to the depilated dorsal skin of 30 Hartley strain female albino guinea pigs. The skin was irradiated with solar simulated UVA from a xenon light source. Acute radiation-induced damage was assayed by erythema grading and inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation into epidermal DNA. Data from erythema grading studies indicated that a significant degree of photoprotection was achieved with 6%, 3%, and 1% solutions of benzophenone compared with the control vehicle; the 6% solution was significantly more photoprotective than the 3% and 1% solutions. A 6% solution afforded significant photoprotection when assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation.\r"

Electron microscopy revealed that the lipids in the cyst contents existed as multiple intercellular lamellae, as in stratum corneum. One lamella, adjacent to the horny cell protein envelope, was resistant to lipid extraction and is thought to represent covalently bound lipid on the outer surface of the keratinocyte. The results indicate that the degradation of intercellular lipid lamellae is not required for desquamation.\r"

The permeability coefficients were determined from a range of DMSO-water systems. After soaking in water overnight, the same stratum corneum was used with water as both delivery and recipient phases for the alkanols. Concentrations below 70% DMSO reduced the penetration rate as a result of the solvent effect of DMSO and the formation of a DMSO-alkanol complex. Above 70% DMSO permeability increased, with a permeability coefficient greater than that from water being achieved at concentrations in excess of 80% DMSO. The second run, with water as delivery phase, showed that the effect was reversible below 70% DMSO, but that at higher concentrations DMSO had produced an irreversible change in the permeability of stratum corneum. We hypothesize a hydrogen bond-mediated mechanism for the increased permeability.\r"

Below 70 degrees C, Kp remained constant; at 75 degrees C, Kp increased linearly with exposure time; at 80 degrees C and above, there was a large increase in under 2 h, with no further increase on longer heating. There was a 15-fold increase in 6-h Kp between 70 degrees C and 80 degrees C, values being constant above 80 degrees C but at a figure less than for lipid-extracted stratum corneum. Thermal analysis showed that the increase in Kp corresponds to changes in the 80 degrees C lipid endotherm, suggesting that the increased Kp is due to a disordering of the lipid structures. The effect of treating preheated stratum corneum with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) vapor for 16 h was also studied. Below 70 degrees C, Kp was increased five-fold, but between 70 and 80 degrees C this difference was eliminated, so that above 80 degrees C the Kp was the same as with heat treatment alone. We concluded that both heat and DMSO affect the lipid structures of stratum corneum. DMSO produced a small, reversible structural change, while the effect of heat is irreversible and produces a greater degree of disorder in the lipid structures, but the lipid still contributed to the barrier effect of stratum corneum.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is an inflammatory subepidermal bullous disease characterized by circulating and tissue-bound complement-binding anti-basement membrane zone autoantibodies to type VII procollagen. Lesions are characterized by neutrophil-predominant inflammation in some patients, but not in others. These features suggest complement activation and generation of complement-derived chemotactic factors for leukocytes by basement membrane zone immune complexes may contribute to inflammation, but that complexes may be heterogeneous in the ability to express that function. In this study, we measured the ability of basement membrane zone complexes from patients with (n = 4) and without (n = 6) neutrophil predominant inflammation to activate complement and generate complement-derived chemotactic activity using a complement-dependent neutrophil attachment assay. The results showed considerable heterogeneity in neutrophil attachment among EBA patients and that both the incidence (4/4 vs 2/6) and magnitude (81 +/- 34 vs 12 +/- 10 neutrophils/mm basement membrane zone) of attachment were greater in patients with neutrophil-predominant inflammation. Functional heterogeneity appeared to be due to differences in the amounts of complement-activating complexes formed at the basement membrane zone, which in turn appeared to be due to differences in the availability of circulating complement-binding anti-basement membrane zone antibodies. This was suggested by a positive correlation (r = 0.72, p less than 0.01) between neutrophil attachment and complement-binding anti-basement membrane zone antibody titers and the observation that high levels of neutrophil attachment could be generated in skin from patients with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita who did not have neutrophil-predominant inflammation by treating their skin in vitro with complement-binding anti-basement membrane zone antibodies. These results suggest tissue complexes in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita are heterogeneous in the ability to activate complement and generate complement-derived chemotactins (C5a, C5a des arg), and that functional heterogeneity contributes to histologic heterogeneity. The functional immunologic-pathologic correlations observed in this study suggest epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is an autoimmune \"collagen\" disease.\r"

In tests on tissue sections, three of the glycoproteins [J143 (gp140/30); T43 (gp85/36); H99 (gp38)] were expressed in the basal cell layer of the epidermis, whereas the other three glycoproteins [T179 (gp140/95); T16 (gp40/50); BT15 (gp80)] were preferentially expressed in maturing keratinocytes above the basal layer. We compared synthesis of these glycoproteins in fresh epidermis and in primary epidermal short term cultures using [35S]methionine for metabolic labeling. Synthesis of J143 was 8- to 20-fold higher and synthesis of T43 was 4- to 10-fold lower in cultured cells compared with fresh epidermis. BT15, an antigen strongly expressed on terminally differentiating keratinocytes, was synthesized at 5- to 15-fold higher levels in fresh epidermis than in cultured cells. Biosynthesis levels of H99, T179, and T16 did not change in cultured epidermal cells. Based on our findings, we propose a model of surface antigenic changes that occur during keratinocyte differentiation in vivo.\r"

The sebaceous gland activity, which was expressed by the ratio of wax esters/[cholesterol + cholesterol esters] (WE/[C + CE]), showed a distinct change from infancy through maturity to senescence; the curve of the ratio made a peak in our subjects's 20s. Using the fatty acid analyses, we found an interesting relationship between C16:1 straight and C16:1 iso-branched chains, each of which occupied a large proportion in the fatty acids of wax esters; the former increased in proportion from infancy toward the 20s, with a correlation with aging (r = 0.788, p less than 0.01), and decreased thereafter until our subject's 50s (r = -0.611, p less than 0.01). In contrast, the proportion of the latter followed an entirely reversed course with advancing age. The percentages of C16:1 straight chain components were correlated positively with the WE/[C + CE] ratio (r = 0.642, p less than 0.01), while there was found to be a negative correlation between the proportion of C16:1 iso-branched chain components and the WE/[C + CE] ratio (r = -0.556, p less than 0.01). The results suggest that more active sebaceous glands in lipid production excrete lipids with a higher proportion of C16:1 straight chain fatty acid and a lower proportion of C16:1 iso-branched chain fatty acid. As well as the sebaceous gland activity, the fatty acid composition in sebum wax esters is affected by advancing age in Japanese.\r"

  ".W": "Biochemical and morphologic studies on the interaction of low density lipoprotein (LDL) with cultured normal keratinocytes and squamous carcinoma cells have shown a negative correlation between LDL receptor activity and terminal differentiation of the epidermal cells [Ponec M et al, J Invest Dermatol 83:436-440, 1984 and Vermeer, BJ et al, J Invest Dermatol 86:195-200, 1986]. Whether such in vitro studies pertain to the epidermis in vivo is not known. To obtain information on the distribution of LDL receptors in the epidermis in situ, morphologic studies were performed using LDL-gold as an ultrastructural marker. When freshly isolated mouse and human epidermal cells were incubated with LDL-gold complexes, only keratinocytes with the morphologic characteristics of basal cells showed binding and uptake of LDL-gold. No LDL receptor activity was found on Langerhans cells, melanocytes or highly differentiated keratinocytes. Since cell separation techniques can destroy receptors, the staphylococcal epidermolytic toxin was utilized to produce intercellular and intra-epithelial splitting of the epidermis. In preparations of both normal mouse and human epidermis, LDL-gold binding was restricted to basal cells and a few suprabasal keratinocytes. In contrast, in psoriatic epidermis, and to a lesser extent, essential fatty acid-deficient mouse epidermis, cells in the stratum spinosum showed abundant LDL-gold binding. Thus LDL-gold may be a useful marker for epidermal differentiation.\r"

Two hundred and ten DBA/2J male mice were implanted with 1 X 10(6) S91 murine melanoma cells innoculated into a noninflammatory upper dermal suction blister cavity. Two tumors were implanted per animal, so that each animal served as its own control in evaluating the effects of temperature, treatment duration, and tumor size on tumor growth following radiofrequency hyperthermia treatment. The data supported the following conclusions: (1) capacitive radiofrequency hyperthermia is effective in the treatment of murine S91 melanoma; (2) duration of treatment between 10 and 60 seconds at 52 degrees C does not influence effectiveness; and (3) treatment temperatures greater than 49 degrees C are needed for maximal effectiveness in the treatment of these tumors. Based on these preliminary findings, high temperature, short duration capacitive radiofrequency hyperthermia may prove to be a useful modality in the treatment of certain cutaneous malignancies.\r"

  ".U": "88034509\r", 
  ".W": "Receptors for synthetic N-formylated chemotactic peptides on peripheral blood neutrophils were studied by the binding of fluorescein-labeled hexapeptide (N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys) to the cells in vitro at the range of concentrations 0.01-100 nM. Mean fluorescence of neutrophils was quantitated by a flow cytometry using FACS III. Comparison was made between 27 patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 14 normal controls. Various receptor states related to cell activities were induced by different temperatures, by incubation of cells with cytochalasin B and by preincubation with nonlabeled N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. This allowed us to distinguish between the specific binding of fluoresceinated hexapeptide to plasma membrane receptor already present (0 degree C), modulation of receptors by peptide and cytochalasin B stimulated degranulation (25 degrees C), and net binding, including internalization of peptide and receptor recycling system (37 degrees C). At peptide concentrations of 1-10 nM, the labeling of neutrophils at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C, but not at 0 degree C, was found to be about 10-35% lower in psoriatic than in healthy subjects (p less than 0.002). The amount of fluorescein-labeled peptide bound to the cells at 25 degrees C was markedly increased by cytochalasin B, but to a much lower extent in psoriatic patients than in normal controls. Although the number of plasma membrane receptor for chemotactic peptides in the nonstimulated neutrophils was not altered in psoriasis, the receptor up-regulation induced by preincubation of the cells with 1-10 nM of nonlabeled N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe at 37 degrees C was reduced when measured by subsequent fluoresceinated hexapeptide uptake at 0 degree C. Receptor recycling, as measured by an increase with time (0-30 min) in the binding of chemotactic peptide by neutrophils in which receptors had been down-regulated, was found to be within normal range in patients with psoriasis. These data indicate that nonstimulated, circulating neutrophils have a normal number of chemotactic peptide receptors on the cell surface, but are less able to recruit intracellular receptors to the cell surface. This finding may be related to smaller internal pools or less efficient translocation of these receptors.\r"

Time-dependent adherence was demonstrated for all fungi studied with maximum adherence occurring between 3 and 4 h. There were no significant differences in adherence rates between the organisms studied. An order of affinity was established between keratinocytes from different sites and significant differences were demonstrated in adherence of microconidia to skin cells derived from sole versus knee. No differences in adherence rates were demonstrated in atopics versus patients with chronic dermatophytosis and normals. Adherence was inhibited, but not abolished, by subinhibitory concentrations of ketoconazole, itraconazole, and griseofulvin. The interaction between microconidia, arthroconidia, and keratinocytes was verified with scanning and transmission electron microscopy.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for prethrombin 2 (Pr2), a potential intermediate in the transformation of prothrombin to thrombin. Antisera against human Pr2 were raised in rabbits and the respective immunoglobulin G fractions were chromatographed on prothrombin-Sepharose. The specific antibody population obtained was used to construct a double-antibody RIA capable of measuring as little as 0.05 nmol/L of this component. The immunoreactivity of prothrombin was approximately 40,000 times less than that of Pr2 on a molar basis. Because of nonspecific contributions of plasma constituents to the immunoreactive signal, the measurement of Pr2 in this milieu required the use of a titration curve in which Pr2 was added back to Pr2-depleted plasma. This assay was then used to determine the levels of this species in two patient populations with increased prothrombin activation as determined by the prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 RIA, a measure of the in vivo cleavage of prothrombin by factor Xa. The mean Pr2 concentrations in eight patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation and six asymptomatic individuals with congenital antithrombin deficiency not receiving antithrombotic therapy were not significantly elevated as compared with those of normal controls (0.244 nmmol/L and 0.242 nmol/L vs. 0.184 nmol/L, respectively). Our studies show that Pr2 is cleared from the plasma of dogs with a t1/2 of approximately 25 minutes. Given that the t1/2 of F1 + 2 is estimated to be approximately 90 minutes, the low plasma levels of Pr2 observed in patients with thrombophilia cannot result from rapid clearance of this component.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 profoundly influence platelet function and vascular tone and are thought to be important in the development of atherosclerosis and angina pectoris, we studied the effects of hypothyroidism in rats on the in vitro elaboration of prostacyclin passively by aortic tissue and of thromboxane A2 by thrombin-stimulated whole blood. Hypothyroidism induced by iodine 131 (given at age 7 weeks) persistently caused a mild decrease in platelet count (P less than 0.01) and 30% decrease in immunoreactive thromboxane B2 (the hydrolysis product of thromboxane A2) generation per platelet (P less than 0.01) compared with age-matched euthyroid rats. Between 20 and 23 weeks of age immunoreactive 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (the hydrolysis product of prostacyclin) generation decreased by 30% in euthyroid rats. In hypothyroid rats less than 23 weeks of age, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha production was the same as that of age-matched euthyroid rats. With further aging, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha production did not decrease as it did in euthyroid rats. Hypothyroid rats more than 20 weeks old had, therefore, significantly greater 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha production than age-matched euthyroid rats (P less than 0.005). L-Thyroxine given daily for 28 days to 23-week-old hypothyroid rats caused a rapid increase in platelet count and a delayed normalization of the thromboxane synthetic abnormality. 6-Ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha production transiently increased in response to L-thyroxine, but decreased to the euthyroid level after 28 days of therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After the completion of these studies showing inhibition of the PAF airway response, we evaluated whether the PAF antagonist could inhibit three types of acute IgE-mediated airway responses to Ascaris suum (A) in rhesus monkeys. The A aerosol test protocols used the following: a single A aerosol challenge system; a threshold dose of A challenge system, which consists of increasing A aerosol exposure until an airway response occurs; and two sequential A challenges in which the response to the second A challenge always occurs if there is a response to the first A challenge. When SRI 63-441 was tested as a potential antagonist of the A airway response in any of these three systems, no inhibition was shown.\r"

  ".W": "Tetranectin is a novel protein recently isolated from human plasma. It is a tetramer, composed of four identical, non-covalently bound, 181-amino-acid polypeptide chains (Mr = 20,100). We report here the quantification of plasma tetranectin in 457 healthy individuals, aged from birth to 85 years, using a newly developed sensitive and reproducible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Tetranectin was demonstrable in all subjects investigated, and within each sex and defined age group the concentration was well controlled within a relatively narrow range. The mean plasma tetranectin level in newborn infants (cord plasma) was about 8 mg/L. This was significantly less than in later life, during which mean plasma tetranectin level varied between 10 and 12 mg/L. After the age of 9 years, tetranectin level was continuously higher in males than in females, but the variations through the span of life were almost identical. Thus, a transitory increase in plasma tetranectin was observed in early puberty, reaching its climax about the age of 11 to 12 in girls and 14 to 15 in boys. A quantitatively similar, additional peak was observed during the period of 50 to 59 years of age in both sexes, whereupon the tetranectin concentration gradually decreased. The biologic function of tetranectin remains to be elucidated. Recently, we have reported that tetranectin is contained within hepatocytes and various endocrine cells, all known to process peptide hormones or glucoproteins. We propose that tetranectin may be involved in intracellular and extracellular serine protease-mediated proteolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Bleomycin, an important chemotherapeutic agent useful in the treatment of testicular carcinoma, can cause lung parenchymal injury. Prior studies showing that different cell types have different susceptibilities to bleomycin suggest that intracellular conditions for bleomycin-DNA interactions vary. The purpose of the present studies was to test the effects of therapeutic concentrations of bleomycin on DNA in vitro, and then to study the effects of these levels of bleomycin on intracellular DNA. In the absence of ferrous ion (Fe+2), bleomycin caused no DNA strand scission at any concentration tested. The addition of as little as 100 nmol/L Fe+2 resulted in DNA strand scission at concentrations of bleomycin greater than or equal to 10 nmol/L. Glutathione dramatically augmented the DNA strand breakage. With use of a viral minichromosome replicating in cultured cells, bleomycin caused DNA strand scission at levels equivalent to therapeutic serum concentrations. These studies reveal that bleomycin causes dose-dependent DNA damage at therapeutic serum concentrations in vitro and in intact cells. The observation that in vitro DNA damage is dependent on the availability of ferrous ion and is augmented by glutathione suggests that different cells, which may differ in their intracellular levels of Fe+2 and reducing capacity, may vary in their sensitivity to bleomycin-induced DNA strand scission.\r"

Experiments were done using the discocyte-rich, less dense fractions of SS cells. When such cells were subjected to d-o cycles in the presence of 2 mmol/L Ca2+, most became dense within 4 hours. The density of these cells was slightly lower than usual for irreversibly sickled cells (ISCs), and because they reverted to the discoidal shape after oxygenation, they were not considered ISCs. However, on further d-o incubation, they did assume the morphology and density typical of ISCs. After an additional incubation (20 hours), most cells decreased in density, became very fragile, and hemolyzed easily. Such light ISCs could also be formed from freshly prepared dense cells on d-o incubation. Once light ISCs were formed, they did not reconvert to dense cells on further incubation. It should be noted that light ISCs created in vitro tended to aggregate much more easily than ordinary (heavy) ISCs did, suggesting that the membrane of these cells may be very adhesive.\r"

This leads to decalcification of the turbinals, as in Sudeck's atrophy. Collapse of the decalcified turbinals is brought about by the impact of the inspiratory stream, and this is followed by atrophic changes. Based on this hypothesis, a new operation ('Vestibuloplasty') has been devised in order to direct the stream away from the turbinals and to dissipate the force of the stream so that its impact on the turbinals is minimized. Following this operation, 92 per cent of the cases have benefitted; this is comparable to the result following Young's or a modified Young's operation. After vestibuloplasty the patient can breathe through the nose and clean the nose as normal persons do; a second-stage procedure for reopening the nostril is not necessary and the chances of recurrence are negligible as compared to those following Young's operation.\r"

(1977), in a clinical study, have indicated an incidence of 10.9 per cent. Studies based on autopsy findings, however, quote a much higher figure (30 per cent, Papac, 1984; 57 per cent, Gowen and Dessuto Nagy, 1963). Dennington and Caster (1980) reported that at least seven per cent of patients with head and neck cancer have distant metastasis when first seen. The present study was designed to find out the incidence of distant metastasis in our head and neck cancer patients.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-seven operations on 53 patients represents the total experience of tracheostomy in children under 13 years during 1964-1985 in an area with half a million inhabitants. No complication occurred during surgery and no deaths were related to the operations. Complications followed 16 out of 30 (53%) operations on children under three years and four out of 27 (15%) of the remainder, an overall complication rate of 35%. Many fewer operations have been required since 1973 because of the successful employment of nasotracheal intubation in the treatment of upper and lower airway obstruction caused by acute infection. Obstruction by-pass remains the commonest function of tracheostomy, with congenital lesions and trauma now the commonest causes of obstruction as opposed to acute infection in the earlier years. Despite the successful use of nasotracheal intubation there were absolute indications for tracheostomy--blockage of the nasotracheal tube; inability to intubate a child with epiglottitis; and necessity for an artificial airway of long duration.\r"

Our research shows that the majority of victims survived the impact only to succumb to toxic gas and fire. We correlated the causes of death, various injuries, and toxicologic findings to body location at the crash site to aid in reconstructing the events surrounding the accident and to address medicolegal problems and safety considerations.

During double simultaneous stimulation within the same VHF as well as with stimuli in different VHFs, the severity of extinction was determined by both the retinotopic and the hemi-spatial position of the extinguished stimulus. The location of the other stimulus, however, did not seem relevant. It is proposed that damage to a corticolimbic-reticular system reduces attentional capacity and that extinction during double simultaneous stimulation in the visual modality reflects an inability to distribute the limited attentional resources equally to two different locations. The severity of extinction is a measure of an unequal distribution of attention along a gradient within visual space.\r"

Expressed as a percentage of measured TCBV the mean errors of these single volume determinations were 2.84% and 1.76% respectively.

Statistical analysis (likelihood ratio tests with chi square approximation and logistic regression) showed that year of diagnosis (p less than 0.01) and level of consciousness at the moment of diagnosis (p less than 0.01) had a significant bearing on the chance to survive and that these same two factors (each factor p less than 0.01) and extent of subdural pus accumulation at the moment of diagnosis (p less than 0.05) had a significant bearing on the chance of survival without severe disability. Among others the duration of the disease up to the moment of diagnosis and the mode of the first surgical procedure had no significant bearing on the outcome. These results together with those in the literature are discussed and it is concluded that diagnosis and treatment before the patient lapses into stupor or coma, increases the chance of survival and that with adequate management a mortality rate of 10% or lower is to be expected.\r"

Life expectancy in the 58 medically treated patients who presented with cholesterol emboli was significantly reduced (p = 0.028). Stroke was the commonest cause of death and was significantly more frequent than in the general population (p less than 0.001); there was also an increased total incidence of cerebrovascular disease (fatal and non-fatal) compared with the Oxfordshire Stroke Project (p less than 0.001). The mortality from ischaemic heart disease was not significantly increased. We report a series of 85 patients with retinal emboli, 69 of whom had cholesterol emboli (70 fundi), 15 calcific emboli and one platelet-fibrin embolus. The natural history of medically treated patients with cholesterol emboli is compared both with an age and sex matched population and with patients with amaurosis fugax but no visible retinal emboli.\r"

Neither circadian rhythms, nor exposure to any one infectious agent accounted for the serial changes in OKT8 cells but there was an association between the presence of HLA-DR2 and periodic reductions in OKT8 cells irrespective of clinical status. Taken with previously reported serial observations in patients and cohabiting relatives, this finding provides indirect evidence for an interplay between environmental and genetic factors in determining OKT8 cell phenotypes in multiple sclerosis.\r"

Shortly before his disease became manifest his 28 year old mother had presented with similar symptoms, and subsequently died. Her brain showed almost identical features including the presence of pathognomonic ultrastructural inclusions. The accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in cerebral white matter as well as high hexacosanoic to docosanoic acid (C26:22) ratios, substantiated the diagnosis in both cases. This is one of the few documented cases of adrenoleukodystrophy in an adult female, and is almost certainly an example of clinical manifestation of this X-linked inherited disease in a carrier.\r"

  ".W": "Ten patients with Parkinson's disease performed a simple reaction time task in which, on hearing a tone, they pressed a button with the left thumb. In the first experiment tones sometimes occurred unannounced and at other times were preceded (by between 0 and 3200 ms) by a warning signal. The second experiment was identical to the first except that the subject had simultaneously to perform a simple continuous task with his right hand. Patients had slower reaction times than controls under all circumstances. In general, however, the effect of a warning signal and the effect of a second task were the same for both groups. In the control group the effect of a warning signal depended on whether or not a second task was being performed. Specifically, the advantage of a warning signal for reaction time was lost after long intervals (greater than 200 ms) when a second task was being performed. Parkinson's disease patients lost this advantage even when they were not performing a second task. Animal studies have suggested that dopamine deficiency results in an increase in neural \"noise\" in the basal ganglia. The behavioural consequences of this may be that Parkinson's disease patients always perform as if they were carrying out another task at the same time. In contrast, their ability to benefit from a warning signal and to allocate attentional resources are unimpaired.\r"

  ".W": "The vertex Readiness Potential (RP) (Bereitschaftspotential) preceding self paced voluntary movements is reduced in duration and amplitude in patients with Parkinsonism. It cannot be used as an index for delayed initiation of movement. The negative potential is commonly replaced by a positive slow wave. In hemi-Parkinsonism, the abnormal RP is more apparent on moving the affected limb. The abnormal RP is related to the severity but not to the duration of Parkinsonism. Short-term fluctuations of akinesia and rigidity, spontaneous or caused by levodopa are associated with changes of RP duration and amplitude. The abnormality does not correlate with reaction or movement times. It is suggested that the Readiness Potential is a diffuse response of area 6 cortex (especially Supplementary Motor Area) evoked by pallido-thalamo-cortical afferents under dopaminergic control. It is not obligatory for pre-programming of voluntary movement. The authors postulate a dendritic potential of basket cells associated with a pallidal activated gate control of postural set.\r"

With dopaminomimetic therapy, tests of delayed verbal memory consistently improved, but did not reach control performance levels. These results could indicate a functional impairment in the mesocortical dopamine system, which can be attenuated, but not entirely corrected, by dopaminomimetic therapy.\r"

Bilateral INC lesioned cats showed dorsiflexion of the neck and impairment of vertical eye movement, similar to progressive supranuclear palsy patients. Analysis of the previous clinical-pathological studies and our case have shown that dorsiflexion of the neck in progressive supranuclear palsy patients was correlated more with INC lesions than lesions of the basal ganglia.\r"

Mab RT97 reacted well with NFTs in freshly processed specimens but not following prolonged fixation.\r"
