  ".W": "We obtained specimens for viral culture from mothers, infants, or both at the time of 6904 deliveries, without regard to the mothers' history of genital herpes. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) was recovered in cultured specimens from 14 of the 6904 deliveries (0.20 percent); all 14 mothers were asymptomatic. All viral isolates were herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Only 1 of the 14 women (7 percent) had a history of genital herpes, whereas 12 (86 percent) had serologic evidence of a previous infection with HSV-2. None of the infants born to these 12 women contracted neonatal herpes. However, one of the two infants born to women with serologic evidence of a primary HSV infection at the time of delivery contracted neonatal herpes. Our findings show that most infants at risk of exposure to HSV at delivery will not be identified if concern about asymptomatic shedding of virus is limited to women with a history of genital herpes infection. Most neonatal exposure to an asymptomatic maternal HSV infection at delivery is not predictable or preventable. Therefore, physicians caring for newborns need to consider neonatal herpes in the differential diagnosis when infants become ill during the first weeks of life, regardless of the presence or absence of identifiable risk factors for HSV infection.\r"

The anterior cruciate ligament, which is an important stabilizer of the knee, is commonly injured. Disruption of the restraint provided by the ligament results in an unstable knee that can give way during pivoting motions. Early reconstruction is usually effective in restoring stability and improving function. Considerable progress has been made in knee bracing. However, prophylactic bracing has not been demonstrated to be effective in preventing knee injuries.\r"

It is occasionally associated with endocrine disorders, including insulin-dependent diabetes, and with epilepsy. We investigated the possible existence of autoimmunity against the nervous system in a patient with stiff-man syndrome associated with epilepsy and Type I diabetes mellitus. Levels of IgG, which had an oligoclonal pattern, were elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid. The serum and the cerebrospinal fluid produced an identical, intense staining of all gray-matter regions when used to stain brain sections according to an indirect light-microscopical immunocytochemical procedure. The staining patterns were identical to those produced by antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid). A band comigrating with glutamic acid decarboxylase in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels appeared to be the only nervous-tissue antigen recognized by cerebrospinal fluid antibodies, and the predominant antigen recognized by serum antibodies. These findings support the idea that an impairment of neuronal pathways that operate through gamma-aminobutyric acid is involved in the pathogenesis of stiff-man syndrome, and they raise the possibility of an autoimmune pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the feasibility and cost savings of hospital discharge three days after acute myocardial infarction, we screened 507 consecutive patients prospectively for clinical complications and exercise-test performance. Of 179 patients whose condition was classified as uncomplicated (no angina, heart failure, or arrhythmia 72 hours after admission), 126 underwent early exercise testing and 90 had no provocable myocardial ischemia. Eighty of these patients were randomly assigned to early (day 3) or conventional (days 7 to 10) hospital discharge. Seventy-six of them had received coronary reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis, angioplasty, or both). At six months of follow-up, there were no deaths or new ventricular aneurysms, and the early-discharge and conventional-discharge groups had similar numbers of hospital readmissions (6 and 10), reinfarctions (none and 5), and patients with angina (3 and 8). In the early-discharge group, 25 of 29 previously employed patients returned to work 40.7 +/- 21.9 days (mean +/- SD) after admission, as compared with 25 of 27 patients in the conventional-discharge group, who returned to work after a mean of 56.9 +/- 30.3 days (P = 0.054). The mean cumulative hospital and professional charges were $12,546 +/- 3,034 in the early-discharge group, as compared with $17,868 +/- 3,688 in the conventional-discharge group (P less than 0.0001). In carefully selected patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction, hospital discharge after three days is feasible and leads to a substantial reduction in hospital charges. Before this strategy can be widely recommended, however, its safety must be confirmed in larger prospective clinical trials.\r"

Since some patients with chronic chlorpromazine-induced cholestasis may have features of primary biliary cirrhosis, we studied the ability to sulfoxidate the amino acid analogue S-carboxymethyl-cysteine in 44 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and in two control groups--one without liver disease and one with a variety of liver diseases other than primary biliary cirrhosis. Poor sulfoxidation was observed in 84 percent of the patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, as compared with 24 percent of patients with other liver diseases and 22 percent of normal controls (P less than 0.0005 for both comparisons). Poor sulfoxidation did not correlate with the degree of hyperbilirubinemia or histologic severity of liver disease in any of the groups studied. There was an inverse correlation with age only in the patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (r = -0.44, P less than 0.001). Liver transplantation was performed in six of the patients and improved sulfoxidation in five; in the four with primary biliary cirrhosis, sulfoxidation improved from poor to good or intermediate. We conclude that poor sulfoxidation is closely associated with primary biliary cirrhosis but not with the other liver diseases we studied.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a study of the effectiveness of an educational intervention designed to modify risk factors associated with coronary heart disease among 3388 children in 37 schools in two demographically dissimilar areas (the Bronx and Westchester County) in and around New York City. Schools within each area were randomly assigned to either intervention or nonintervention groups. In schools targeted for intervention, children in the fourth through eighth grades were taught a teacher-delivered curriculum focusing on diet, physical activity, and cigarette smoking. Risk-factor levels were measured in all schools at base line and at four follow-up points. A total of 1769 of the children qualified for analysis of the intervention effect. After five years, the net mean change in plasma levels of total cholesterol was -1.7 mg per deciliter per year (-0.04 mmol per liter) (95 percent confidence interval, -2.7 to -0.7 mg per deciliter [-0.07 to -0.02 mmol per liter]) in the Westchester County schools, or -8.5 mg per deciliter (-0.22 mmol per liter) (5.1 percent) over a period of five years. In the schools in the Bronx, the net mean change was -1.0 mg per deciliter per year (-0.03 mmol per liter) (95 percent confidence interval, -2.3 to +0.3 mg per deciliter [-0.06 to +0.01 mmol per -2.3 to +0.3 mg per deciliter [-0.06 to +0.01 mmol per liter]), or -5.0 mg per deciliter (-0.13 mmol per liter) (2.9 percent) over a period of five years. Favorable trends in dietary intake and health knowledge were also observed, whereas the other targeted risk factors were not significantly altered. If these findings can be replicated, this will suggest that educational programs to modify coronary risk factors are feasible and may have a favorable (albeit small) effect on blood levels of cholesterol in children.\r"

  ".W": "Neurotransmitter release from many central nervous system synapses is regulated by 'autoreceptors' at the synaptic terminal, which bind the released transmitter and alter release accordingly. The photoreceptors of lower vertebrates are thought to use glutamate as a neurotransmitter. Glutamate conveys the visual signal to postsynaptic bipolar and horizontal cells, but has been reported not to act on the photoreceptors themselves. We show here that glutamate evokes a current, carried largely by chloride ions, in cones isolated from the tiger salamander retina. This response is localized to the synaptic terminal of the cone. Removing external sodium blocks this action of glutamate. These results suggest the existence of a positive feedback loop at the cone output synapse: over most of the light-response range, glutamate released by depolarization of the cone will cause further depolarization, increasing the gain of phototransduction. Glutamate released from rods may also polarize cones, modulating the gain of the cone output synapse. This system is surprisingly different from the autoreceptor systems for most other transmitters, which act in a negative feedback way.\r"

  ".W": "Membrane anchoring of proteins by a covalently attached glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moiety has been reported in many different eukaryotic cells including parasite protozoa. The diversity of proteins in which this phospholipid attachment is found suggests that it is functionally important and perhaps also functionally pleiotropic. Studies on the Thy-1 antigen of murine lymphocytes indicate that it can facilitate the lateral mobility of membrane proteins. It can also permit the rapid and specific release of the anchored proteins from the membrane following cleavage by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Here we show that this type of anchoring may be involved in the regulation of an enzymatic activity. PI-PLC releases a Plasmodium falciparum membrane protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 76K (p76) from intact merozoites or isolated schizont membranes and induces a proteolytic activity associated with its soluble form. Endogenous activation of the proteolytic activity of p76 appears to occur at the end of the schizogony and could initiate a cascade of biochemical events associated with merozoite maturation.\r"

Aneurysms secondary to nonpenetrating trauma occur at the skull base or in the periphery, with motor vehicle accidents and falls as the most common modes of injury. Skull base traumatic aneurysms most commonly involve the petrous, cavernous, or supraclinoid carotid artery and also show a predominance in teenage boys. Peripheral traumatic aneurysms can further be divided into distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms secondary to trauma against the falcine edge and distal cortical artery aneurysms associated with an overlying skull fracture. Peripheral traumatic aneurysms tend to occur in younger patients with a less marked male predominance. Two-thirds of the patients suffered symptomatic aneurysmal hemorrhage, with an associated mortality rate of 31%. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of traumatic intracranial aneurysms are discussed.\r"

This technique was used in cases where an approach along the long axis of the hematoma was not feasible. With this method, aspiration is done at two target points lying anterior and posterior of the somewhat harder central region, at which aspiration is not attempted. This technique allows aspiration of most of the serum components, which are depicted as low density areas in computed tomographic (CT) scans, and some 53 to 85% of the main mass of the hematoma, which is seen on CT as high density areas. There was no rebleeding among these nine patients, and the remaining hematoma in all cases was located between two target points--a fact that is thought to indicate that the central portion of the hematoma is in fact somewhat harder than the peripheral portions. Although the double track aspiration technique has the disadvantage of producing two tracks, it is thought to be an effective method in such cases because it allows safe and thorough hematoma aspiration.\r"

AB therapy has significantly reduced mortality, but additional treatment with anticoagulants (AC) has remained controversial. We reviewed our experience with seven cases, as well as the literature since Lyons' 1941 introduction of AC treatment, to determine effectiveness, complications, and morbidity among survivors. We divided the cases into (1) those treated with AB alone, and (2) those treated with a combination of AB and AC. We found no conclusive evidence for reduction of mortality when AC was used in combination with AB. However, early AC therapy reduced morbidity (blindness, stroke, ophthalmoplegia, hypopituitarism, focal seizures, and vascular steal syndrome), whereas delayed or inadequate use provided no apparent benefit above AB therapy alone. Complications of AC therapy were rare; cerebral venous thrombosis occurred frequently, but in association with dural sinus thrombosis as a direct result of the disease. We conclude that AC therapy is indicated early in the treatment of CST to reduce morbidity among survivors.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a double-blind trial with the calcium antagonist, diltiazem (8 mg/kg/d), for 24 to 32 months in 22 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, who were paired by functional activity and age. No adverse clinical or ECG effects of diltiazem were detected. In eight matched pairs, completing 28 months, manual muscle testing scores fell somewhat less in the diltiazem group (from 5.5 to 4.6) than in the placebo group (from 5.3 to 4.2), although the difference between groups was not significant (p = 0.06). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in slopes of regression lines obtained from trimonthly manual muscle tests on all subjects was markedly asymmetric in favor of the diltiazem group, but this difference was also not significant. There was less deterioration of functional activity of lower extremities in the diltiazem-treated group, when beginning and end values were analyzed (p = 0.03). However, the difference in slopes of regression lines obtained from trimonthly determinations was nonsignificant. Similarly, the beginning versus end comparisons of systolic and diastolic blood pressure showed a significantly (p less than 0.05) smaller elevation of blood pressure in the diltiazem-treated group, but no difference was observed when the slopes of all values were analyzed. All other clinical and laboratory variables were unaffected by diltiazem treatment. The findings in manual muscle tests and functional activity suggest a beneficial trend with chronic diltiazem treatment in DMD.\r"

This investigation was conducted to determine whether human fetuses exposed to diagnostic ultrasound (sonography) have a greater risk of growth retardation than fetuses not so exposed. This retrospective cohort study compares the birth weights of 1598 exposed and 944 unexposed single live births at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland during calendar year 1981. Confounding variables, defined as those associated with both exposure status and birth weight outcome, were included in multivariable analysis. Both exposure to more than one ultrasound procedure and first exposure during the third trimester were associated with a reduction in birth weight. However, the most consistent effect associated with birth weight appeared to be the indication for an ultrasound examination. The relationship of ultrasound exposure and reduced birth weight appeared to be due to shared common risk factors, which lead to both exposure and a reduction in birth weight.\r"

  ".W": "A real-time ultrasound screening examination was performed in 3208 unselected singleton pregnancies at 18 and 34 weeks to detect small for gestational age (SGA) fetuses below the tenth percentile weight for age. Such cases accounted for 4.9% of this population. Biparietal diameter (BPD) was used at the first examination to confirm the true gestational age. The growth was measured at 34 weeks with a combination of BPD and transverse abdominal diameter. With a cutoff level of -1.5 standard deviations (SD), the sensitivity of a single measurement was 62.2%, the specificity was 93.2%, and the positive predictive value was 32.4%. With a cutoff level of -1 SD, the values were 76.3, 84.8, and 20.4%, respectively. The positive predictive value approached 48.7% before birth in the group that was rescanned before delivery. The simple method of a combined measurement of BPD and transverse abdominal diameter provided efficient antenatal screening for diagnosis of SGA fetuses in the general population. A somewhat low positive predictive value indicates a control examination of fetuses suspected of being SGA. Nonlinear methods, such as the measurement of abdominal circumference, appear suitable for ruling out false-positive cases.\r"

The outcomes for these 16 fetuses included 12 terminations, two fetal deaths, one related death six months after birth, and one transient abnormality with no apparent significant sequelae. The ultrasound examination failed to detect at least nine other fetuses with structural malformations. The relatively small size and early stage of development of the fetuses at the time of genetic amniocentesis appears to have contributed to the failure of ultrasound to detect these malformations. A brief search for fetal malformations during obstetric ultrasound performed at early genetic amniocentesis appears productive enough to be worthwhile. However, if there is a special indication to search for fetal malformations, the ultrasound examination should probably be repeated later.\r"

Various adhesion-producing conditions leading to retention of ovarian tissue, such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or inflammatory bowel disease, were present at the original procedure. The increase in diagnosis of this condition during the past five years may represent a greater awareness of the potential condition, combined with wider use of ultrasonography and computed tomography scanning. Twenty of the 31 patients were found to have a tender palpable mass of thickening. In 11 patients, a mass was found only on ultrasonography. Surgical correction required dissection and mobilization of the ureter throughout its entire pelvic course to facilitate resection of the specimen. The complications were minor, and symptoms were relieved.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of every-other-day gonadotropin-releasing hormone administration was investigated in clomiphene-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) resistant, anovulatory women with hypogonadotropism or normogonadotropism. One hundred micrograms of gonadotropin-releasing hormone was injected intramuscularly three times a week for four weeks (one course). Ten of 11 hypogonadotropic patients responded to clomiphene or clomiphene-hCG after one to three courses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment. Once the patients were converted to clomiphene responsiveness, ovulatory response continued without additional treatment, and all four patients who desired pregnancy conceived. Among eight normogonadotropic women, four with amenorrhea of one year or less became clomiphene-hCG responders after one or two courses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment. They were subsequently treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone after every one or two ovulatory cycles. One of the four women who desired to be pregnant conceived. We conclude that intramuscular gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment is effective in inducing responsiveness to clomiphene, especially in hypogonadotropic anovulatory women. In normogonadotropic women, gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment may be useful in those who have been amenorrheic for less than a year.\r"

It is estimated that at least 15-38% of adults have been sexually abused as children, with figures higher for women than for men. Failure to report abuse is common, and only 20-50% of incidents may come to the attention of authorities. Although childhood sexual abuse is present in all socioeconomic groups, more severe forms of abuse appear to be associated with lower socioeconomic status. After the age of ten, a sharp increase is observed in vaginal intercourse, sexual assaults accompanied by physical violence, and abuse committed by strangers. Although fathers are frequently cited as the primary perpetrators, not all studies support this finding. Other relatives have been reported to account for 20-70% of the sexual abuse occurring within the family. A history of childhood abuse may contribute to sexual problems or multiple chronic complaints in the adult woman. Moreover, some of these women may experience depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The gynecologist should use empathetic questioning with all patients regarding abuse, and integrate the patient's history of abuse with current health care. Physicians who are uncomfortable with this topic or who observe ongoing distress in their patients should refer these women to a mental health practitioner who is familiar with the issues common to women who have experienced childhood sexual abuse.\r"

  ".W": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a specific variant of adenocarcinoma with a characteristic cribriform appearance. The tumor may arise from salivary glands and various other sites, but the origin and cellular composition of this unique neoplasm have been controversial. A potential use of immunohistochemistry is to provide additional information on the origin of various cellular components of tumors by comparing them with corresponding normal tissues. Immunohistochemical distributions of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), keratin, low molecular weight keratin (54 kd), S100 protein, muscle-specific actin, laminin, and type IV collagen were evaluated in 20 adenoid cystic carcinomas arising in major and minor salivary glands. Anti-CEA, anti-EMA, anti-keratin, and anti-S100 antibodies strongly stained cells lining true lumina. Muscle-specific actin, a marker for myoepithelial cells, was found in lining cells of pseudocysts, in tumor cells proper, and in nonluminal cells with a tubular growth pattern. A monoclonal antibody against 54 kd keratin stained almost all cells in the neoplasms. In pseudocysts, replicated basal lamina reacted with antisera to laminin and to type IV collagen. The present study demonstrates that there are at least two populations of tumor cells in adenoid cystic carcinoma: luminal cells that express CEA and EMA, thus indicating their ductal character, and nonluminal cells that express muscle-specific actin characteristic of myoepithelium.\r"

It is more prevalent in young females and may be evident clinically as a pruritic lower lip cheilitis that typically does not respond to conventional therapy. Other clinical features associated with AP include conjunctivitis, alopecia of the eyebrows, and formation of pterygia. The histologic features of AP have been described as nonspecific. We are presenting five cases of AP in which the major clinical manifestation was a pruritic, unsightly lower lip cheilitis. All of our patients were American Indians. Three patients were from the same family. The youngest patient was 10 years old and the oldest was 69 years old. All five cases were characterized histologically by numerous germinal centers within the lamina propria and a dense perivascular plasma cell infiltrate. In four of the five cases, there was a moderate to dense infiltrate of eosinophils. All five patients had been generally unresponsive to conventional therapy. With the exception of the youngest patient, all had had the disease for at least several years. One patient, now deceased, had the lower lip lesion surgically removed for cosmetic reasons. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the dental literature that describes the clinical and histologic features of AP of lower lip.\r"

  ".W": "In two separate studies, in which two different treatment regimens of Sn-protoporphyrin were used, a total of 69 control and 53 treated infants were studied to determine whether this potent inhibitor of the enzyme, heme oxygenase, could ameliorate the severity of the hyperbilirubinemia which develops in term babies with direct Coombs-positive ABO incompatibility. The results indicate that Sn-protoporphyrin can, in appropriate doses, moderate the postnatal rate of increase of plasma bilirubin levels and diminish the intensity of hyperbilirubinemia in treated babies. In addition, a decreased use of phototherapy in Sn-protoporphyrin-treated infants was observed. No rebound hyperbilirubinemia was detected during the six- to eight-day period after Sn-protoporphyrin administration. The plasma clearance (t1/2) of Sn-protoporphyrin was much faster in newborns than in adults (approximately 1.6 hours v 3.5 hours, respectively). The incidence of clinical side effects in the 53 Sn-protoporphyrin-treated infants was limited to the development of transient erythema during the use of concurrent phototherapy in two babies. In both infants this reaction subsided completely without sequelae. The use of Sn-protoporphyrin or related synthetic heme analogues to diminish the severity of hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants merits further study because inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of heme to bilirubin may prove to be a useful therapeutic approach in the clinical management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, especially in settings in which, for social or economic reasons, other treatment modalities are not available.\r"

In a subset of 12- to 24-month-old children, modified fluorescent antibody test for membrane antigen was not detectable at seven days postimmunization but was detectable in 50% by 14 days and in 100% by 21 days. Within 6 weeks, 96.6% of children 12 to 24 months and 94.7% of siblings seroconverted. The geometric mean titer did not vary with age at immunization. One-year blood samples were obtained from 70 children 12 to 24 months of age who seroconverted; 92.9% retained detectable antibody. The geometric mean titer had decreased from 55.7 to 18.6. Of these 70 children, 34% had been exposed to varicella since immunization, and two cases of varicella were observed in seroconverters. Both cases were mild, with less than 50 vesicles. Oka/Merck varicella vaccine appears to be safe, highly immunogenic, and protective against 96% of exposures to natural varicella during the first year after vaccination in infants. Those cases of varicella that develop in immunized children appear substantially reduced in severity.\r"

The material isolated from the iodine-oxidized enzyme was shown to be a pterin by conversion to pterin-6-carboxylic acid with alkaline permanganate and was found to release glutamate upon acid hydrolysis. The presence of 10-formylfolate in the isolated, oxidized chromophore was demonstrated by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and by deformylation and conversion to folic acid. Analysis of the distribution of polyglutamates revealed that the four species identified by HPLC corresponded to the tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexaglutamate derivatives of 10-formylfolate. The results were consistent with gamma linkages in the triglutamate derivative with additional glutamates linked via the alpha-carboxyl group of the preceding residue. Treatment with rat plasma hydrolase produced the monoglutamate derivative of 10-formylfolate. The native, enzyme-bound form of the folate cofactor was identified as 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate by effecting release and isolation at low pH to protect the 5,10-methenyl bridge and preserve the reduced pyrazine ring structure.\r"

  ".W": "The DBL transforming gene was originally identified by transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with DNA from a human B-cell lymphoma. This gene was found to have arisen as a result of recombination of the 3' portion of the DBL protooncogene coding sequences with an unrelated segment of human DNA. It encodes a cytoplasmic protein that is equally distributed between cytosol and crude membrane fractions. To further characterize this transforming gene, a biologically active cDNA clone of the DBL transforming gene mRNA was isolated. Analysis of the sequence of the DBL oncogene cDNA revealed a long open reading frame that encodes a hybrid protein whose first 50 amino acids (at least) derive from a complete exon of a different locus. No significant homology with known oncogenes or any known protein sequences was demonstrated. The computer analysis of the predicted DBL protein indicated it is highly hydrophilic with no hydrophobic domains characteristic of a membrane-spanning region or signal peptide. Thus, the DBL oncoprotein is distinct among known transforming gene products.\r"

We used synthetic oligonucleotides to investigate the effect of cytosine methylation on the binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to its target sequence (a G + C-rich sequence known as a \"GC box\"). Concatemers of double-stranded 14-mers containing a GC box successfully competed with the human metallothionein IIA promoter for binding to Sp1 in DNase I protection experiments. The presence of 5-methylcytosine in the CpG sequence of the GC box did not influence Sp1 binding. The result was confirmed using double-stranded 20-mers containing 16 base pairs of complementary sequence. Electrophoretic gel retardation analysis of annealed 28-mers containing a GC box incubated with an Sp1-containing HeLa cell nuclear extract demonstrated the formation of DNA-protein complexes; formation of these complexes was not inhibited when an oligomer without a GC box was used as a competitor. Once again, the presence of a 5-methylcytosine residue in the GC box did not influence the binding of the protein to DNA. The results therefore preclude a direct effect of cytosine methylation on Sp1-DNA interactions.\r"

  ".W": "A mitochondrial gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoding a hydrophobic membrane protein, subunit 8 of the F0/F1-type mitochondrial ATPase complex, has been functionally replaced by an artificial nuclear gene specifying an imported version of this protein. The experiments reported here utilized a multicopy expression vector (pLF1) that replicates in the nucleus of yeast cells and that carries an inserted DNA segment, specifying a precursor protein (N9/Y8) consisting of subunit 8 fused to an N-terminal cleavable transit peptide (the leader sequence from Neurospora crassa ATPase subunit 9). The successful incorporation of the imported subunit 8 into functional ATPase complexes after transformation with pLF1 expressing N9/Y8 was indicated by the efficient genetic complementation of respiratory growth defects of aap1 mit- mutants, which lack endogenous subunit 8. The reconstitution of ATPase function was confirmed by biochemical assays of ATPase performance in mitochondria and by immunochemical analyses that demonstrated the assembly of the cytoplasmically synthesized subunit 8 into the ATPase complex. Reconstitution of ATPase function required the cytoplasmically synthesized subunit to have a transit peptide. The strategy for importation and reconstitution developed for subunit 8 leads to a systematic approach to the directed manipulation of mitochondrially encoded membrane-associated proteins that has general implications for exploring membrane biogenesis mechanistically and evolutionarily.\r"

  ".U": "88176894\r", 
  ".W": "A protein kinase activity was identified in preparations of DNA-replicative complex from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The activity phosphorylated only a few of the endogenous proteins in the replicative fraction, and it displayed a marked preference for a 48-kDa polypeptide. Despite this relative specificity, the protein kinase activity was capable of utilizing exogenously added histone as substrate. The 48-kDa polypeptide was phosphorylated on serine residue(s) exclusively by the endogenous activity in the replicative-complex preparation. The activity was not stimulated by cAMP, cGMP, Ca2+/phosphatidylserine/diacylglycerol, or Ca2+/calmodulin. It did not utilize Ca2+ or Zn2+ in the place of Mg2+, and Mn2+ was only 22% as effective in fulfilling the divalent-cation requirement. Most importantly, the protein kinase activity was heat-sensitive in replicative fractions from the cell division cycle 7 (cdc7) mutant, which arrests at or close to the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle at restrictive temperature. Thus, the activity is CDC7-dependent. An effect of heat treatment on replicating activity in the replicative fraction from cdc7 cells was also found. This result and the finding that the protein kinase activity copurified with replicating activity in the preparations suggest that the CDC7 gene product and the protein kinase activity, whether or not they are the same entity, interact with yeast replicative complex. All of these results raise the possibility that phosphorylation of components of the replication machinery may play a role in the control of initiation of DNA replication during the cell cycle. It is possible that the phosphorylation observed is part of a protein kinase cascade that regulates progress through the G1 phase of the cell cycle.\r"

ABF-I binds within a region previously shown to be essential for the function of ARS1 when yeast are grown under certain nutritional conditions, and deletion analysis presented here suggests that the ARS1 domain containing the ABF-I-binding site, domain B, is a complex element composed of at least two subdomains. ABF-I also binds within an ARS at the HMR silent mating locus. This ARS functions as a cis-acting transcriptional silencer, and the ABF-I-binding site within this ARS is important for both ARS and silencer function.\r"

The frequency of transposition events that involve an inside end is regulated 1000-fold by the host dam methylase system. The end sequence requirements for transposition and its regulation by dam methylase were analyzed in Escherichia coli by generating random single base pair mutations in either an IS50 inside end or outside end placed in inverted orientation with respect to an unmutagenized outside end. The mutations were then isolated, assayed for transposition phenotype, and sequenced. Mutations were isolated at 15 of the 19 sites in the outside end. All of these mutations except those at position 4 decreased transposition. Mutations at position 4 (which is the only nonidentical base pair in a region of homology between the outside and inside ends) had no effect on transposition. Mutations were isolated at 11 of the 19 sites in the inside end. All of these mutations, including one at position 4, decreased transposition in dam- cells. Mutations at position 10 (within a dam recognition sequence) and 2 (not within a dam recognition sequence) reduced the magnitude of dam regulation. A mutation within a dam recognition sequence adjacent to the required 19 base pairs of the inside end did not reduce the magnitude of dam regulation.\r"

The agonist [D-Trp6]LH-RH (in which Gly-6 is replaced by D-tryptophan) and the antagonist N-Ac-[D-Phe(pCl)1,2,D-Trp3,D-Arg6,D-Ala10]LH-RH were administered for 12 weeks: [D-Trp6]LH-RH was given once a month in the form of long-acting microcapsules liberating 25 micrograms of agonist per day, and the antagonist was injected s.c. at a dose of 1000 micrograms per kg of body weight per day for the first 3 weeks and, thereafter, at a dose of 500 micrograms per kg of body weight per day. After a recovery period of 3 months, most seminiferous tubules in the antagonist-treated group showed a normal morphology, while patches of tubules in the agonist-treated group continued to show some suppression of spermatogenesis. Administration of busulfan, cisplatin, or cyclophosphamide produced only a reversible testicular injury, and pretreatment with LH-RH analogs seemed to temporarily enhance the tubular damage. Administration of procarbazine (200 mg per kg of body weight per week for 6 weeks) resulted in decreased testicular weights and increased serum LH levels 1 and 3 months after the discontinuation of treatment. The histology showed severe diffuse damage to seminiferous tubules. The germinal cells completely disappeared and the Sertoli cells were markedly degenerated. This damage was not restored even after a recovery period of 5 months. Some animals were pretreated for 6 weeks with the agonist or antagonist and then received procarbazine for 6 weeks while administration of analogs was continued. In these animals, the decrease in testicular weights and increase in serum LH levels after procarbazine were less marked than in the group not pretreated with the analogs. Three and 5 months after cessation of treatment, a large number of tubules showed a complete restoration of structural morphology in 30-45% of the animals that received procarbazine and the LH-RH agonist or antagonist. These results indicate that pretreatment with LH-RH analogs may protect testes against damage caused by some cytotoxic agents.\r"

The detection of EDRF was potentiated by superoxide dismutase, and the relaxation of rabbit aortic strips induced by EDRF was antagonized by methylene blue. The release of EDRF and prostacyclin was inhibited by phorbol myristate acetate, R59022 (a diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor), and gentamycin. We suggest that the release of EDRF and prostacyclin is coupled and the initial common step is activation of a phospholipase C.\r"

  ".W": "An approach for providing feedback control for polypeptide drugs in a polymeric controlled-release system uses a trigger molecule and a polymer-bound enzyme that, in the presence of that trigger molecule, will cause an acid or a base to form. When the pH inside the polymer system changes, the solubility of the drug shifts dramatically, which changes the diffusion or dissolution driving force, and hence the release rate changes correspondingly. This concept was tested using a controlled-release system of ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer containing insulin and immobilized glucose oxidase. The enzymatic reaction of glucose to gluconic acid reduces the pH in the polymer microenvironment. Since insulin solubility increases with decreasing pH (at physiologic pH, this is true for an insulin with an isoelectric point of 7.4 or higher), the release of insulin increases in response to glucose concentration. The feasibility of this concept has been shown using trilysyl insulin with an isoelectric point of 7.4. Multiple exposures to buffered glucose solutions over several weeks caused insulin release to reversibly increase during each exposure. Polymer-implanted diabetic rats infused with glucose solutions showed a significant increase in insulin concentration in 30 min-an effect not observed in three different sets of control rats.\r"

Fourteen male golden hamsters were anesthetized and prepared for fluorescence microscopy of the cheek pouch. Intravenous fluorescein-labeled dextran (MW 150,000) served as a tracer of plasma proteins. Protein leaks from the microvessels were quantified every 5 minutes for a 25-minute baseline period and again after a 5-minute superfusion with 10(-5)-M histamine. High voltage stimulation (HVS) was applied simultaneously with the histamine to the vascular bed of the treatment animals in a dosage of 10, 30, or 50 V; the control animals received no electrical stimulation. Histamine increased microvessel leakiness in all groups, but the number of posthistamine microvessel leaks was significantly less in animals that received a 30- or 50-V dose of HVS than in the control animals or those that received a 10-V dose. The study results suggest that at intensities greater than a threshold dose, HVS reduces microvessel leakiness. Reduced microvessel leakiness may be one mechanism by which HVS retards edema formation.\r"

  ".W": "National surveillance for salmonella infections was established in 1962, following recognition of the importance of Salmonella organisms as the cause of potentially preventable infectious disease in the United States. Reports of infections due to Salmonella have risen progressively to approximately 40,000 per year. In contrast, the parallel reporting system for infections due to Shigella shows no such increase. Because a passive surveillance system is used, it has been assumed salmonella infections have been substantially underreported. Three independent methods-determination of carriage rates, calculation of sequential surveillance artifacts, and calculation of overall surveillance artifact-were used to estimate the annual number of salmonella infections in the United States; the results were compared with those of a previous study. These methods produced estimates ranging from 800,000 to 3,700,000 (mean = 1,900,000; median = 1,400,000) infections annually. Accurate assessment of the number of infections is important for determining complication rates and for evaluating the efficacy of control programs.\r"

  ".W": "As the second largest group of persons to have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the most likely to transmit HIV to heterosexual partners in the United States and Europe, iv drug users will play an increasingly important role in the future of the AIDS epidemic. This paper reviews five emerging critical issues regarding HIV infection among iv drug users. In epidemiology, rates of drug injection and anonymous sharing of injection equipment appear related to rapid spread of HIV among iv drug users, while heterosexual transmission from iv drug users appears to have been occurring at a relatively slow but constant rate. Data exist that support a gender-related cofactor and a continuing drug injection cofactor, but mechanisms for these potential cofactors have not been determined. Besides frank AIDS, HIV infection also appears to lead to epidemic-level increases in a variety of fatal infections among iv drug users. Several studies of prevention show active risk reduction among iv drug users, but new methods are urgently needed to increase amount of risk reduction.\r"

Recovery from infection is the principal role of T cell immunity, and cells that recognize virus-infected cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) and kill them--often before new virus is replicated--represent a crucial component of the recovery process. The cytotoxic T lymphocytes are particularly important in situations where the load of infection is high. In this review the cells and mediators, as well as the viral and host cell antigens involved in antiviral induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the importance of the intracellular pathway of processing taken by viral antigens and the outcome in terms of the recognition of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The new types of vaccines--especially subunits, antiidiotypes, and recombinant viral vectors--are discussed in terms of their likely effectiveness at inducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes.\r"

Ferret influenza has been used to elucidate the following facets of pathogenicity that bear on these questions about human disease: the differential infectivity of virus strains for the upper respiratory tract (URT); the reasons for less severe infection of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) than of the URT; why pneumonia is rare; and why strains differ in the production of LRT infection. The origin of fever has been defined; viruses have been shown to differ in fever-producing components. Poor spread of virus from the respiratory tract to other susceptible tissues and rarity of fetal infection have been explained. Death in neonatal ferrets due to influenza with either a syndrome akin to cot death or viral pneumonia have been elucidated, and protection of the young by immunized mothers has been demonstrated.\r"

This review focuses on the use of cefoxitin in obstetric and gynecologic infections, with comparisons to older and newer antibiotics. Numerous studies have shown that cefoxitin is clearly effective; in most of these studies, however, either the initial infection rates were low or the sample sizes were small--circumstances making it difficult to establish the superiority of any one agent. Thus, the necessity of using a drug with activity against B. fragilis for prevention and treatment of pelvic infections has not been proven. Several antibiotics without such activity have been equally effective. Cefoxitin may be of particular value when combined with surgical drainage of pelvic abscesses, infections in which control of B. fragilis may be especially important to outcome.\r"

These systems-composed of a microscope and attached photomultiplier tube or camera, an image processor, and a computer-have been used to measure lysosomal enzymes, pH, and calcium within phagocytes; to detect viral nucleic acids in in situ hybridization preparations; and to quantitate rates of cellular movement. These experiments have shown that (1) the intracellular proliferation of virulent microorganisms is associated with reductions in acid phosphatase, beta-glucuronidase, and lysozyme activity; (2) virulent Toxoplasma gondii, Legionella pneumophila, and Nocardia asteroides inhibit phagosomal acidification; and (3) changes in intracellular calcium movement affect phagocytic function. These methods have also been used to detect the AIDS virus within cultured lymphocytes and to measure cellular chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Further advances in technology should produce improved microscopic image analysis systems with wider applications for the investigation of infectious diseases.\r"

The theoretical framework provides a language and a strategy, accompanied by new observables, that may afford an understanding of dynamic patterns at several scales of analysis (including behavioral patterns, neural networks, and individual neurons) and the linkage among them.\r"

  ".W": "The transition from the expression of alpha, the first set of five herpes simplex virus genes expressed after infection, to beta and gamma genes, expressed later in infection, requires the participation of infected cell protein 4 (alpha 4), the major viral regulatory protein. The alpha 4 protein is present in complexes formed by proteins extracted from infected cells and viral DNA fragments derived from promoter domains. This report shows that the alpha 4 protein forms specific complexes with DNA fragments derived from 5' transcribed noncoding domains of late (gamma 2) genes whose expression requires viral DNA synthesis as well as functional alpha 4 protein. Some of the DNA fragments to which alpha 4 binds do not contain homologs of the previously reported DNA binding site consensus sequence, suggesting that alpha 4 may recognize and interact with more than one type of DNA binding site. The alpha 4 proteins can bind to DNA directly. A posttranslationally modified form of the alpha 4 protein designated alpha 4c differs from the alpha 4a and alpha 4b forms with respect to its affinity for DNA fragments differing in the nucleotide sequences of the binding sites.\r"

These pleiotropic effects appear to reflect the ability of NCAM to regulate membrane-membrane contact required to initiate specific interactions between other molecules. Such regulation can occur through changes in either NCAM expression or the molecule's content of polysialic acid (PSA). When NCAM with a low PSA content is expressed, adhesion is increased and contact-dependent events are triggered. In contrast, the large excluded volume of NCAM PSA can inhibit cell-cell interactions through hindrance of overall membrane apposition.\r"

In this study, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) were found in blood samples from HIV-1-infected individuals. CTL targets were prepared by immortalizing B cells from ten seropositive and six seronegative individuals, and then infecting these cells with recombinant vaccinia viruses containing HIV-1 genes. CTL directed against autologous B lymphoblasts expressing HIV-1 reverse transcriptase were detected in fresh blood samples from eight HIV-1 seropositive subjects, but in no seronegative controls. The effector cells were identified as major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes. Because the HIV-1 pol gene is highly conserved among different isolates and generates both humoral and cellular immune responses, it bears consideration for inclusion in a candidate AIDS vaccine.\r"

This novel arrangement is distinct from the \"zinc finger\" domain observed in other eukaryotic regulatory proteins.

Partial proteolysis and circular dichroism spectra suggest that metal binding has its primary effects in the cysteine-rich region and relatively little effect on the folding of other regions.

These results confirmed the presumed location of the exonuclease active site on the small domain of Klenow fragment and its physical separation from the polymerase active site. An anomalous scattering difference Fourier of a complex of the wild-type enzyme with divalent manganese ion and deoxythymidine monophosphate showed that the exonuclease active site has binding sites for two divalent metal ions. The properties of the mutant proteins suggest that one metal ion plays a role in substrate binding while the other is involved in catalysis of the exonuclease reaction.\r"

This inhibition is specific, since 2AP does not inhibit induction of either the hsp70 heat-shock gene by high temperature or the metallothionein gene by cadmium or dexamethasone. However, 2AP does block the induction of the c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogenes by serum growth factors or virus, suggesting that a protein kinase may be involved in the regulation of these genes, as well as of the beta-interferon gene. However, different factors must be required for the induction of these three genes, since they are not coordinately regulated by the same inducers in most of the cell lines examined.\r"

Three classes of mechanisms are described for such distal actions: tracking or translocation of a protein along a DNA, the association of two proteins bound at separate sites to form a DNA loop in between, and distal interactions that are affected by the topology of the DNA. The basic characteristics of each type of mechanism are discussed in terms of the known physicochemical properties of DNA. The various modes of action at a distance are often interrelated. Examples include the formation of positively and negatively supercoiled DNA loops by tracking and the strong effects of DNA topology on looping.\r"

The charge-separated complex, [(ZnCcP)+,FeIICc] converts to [ZnCcP,FeIIICc] by a single, intracomplex electron transfer step that is not governed by \"gating\" through possible rapid dissociation of the complex or isomerization (for example, heme-ligand) by FeIICc subsequent to its formation from FeIIICc. In every variant with an aliphatic residue at position 82 of Cc, the rate of this electron transfer process is approximately 10(4) slower at approximately 0 degrees C than for the two variants with aromatic residues.\r"

A method is described here for inducing protective cell-mediated immunity to sporozoites by immunization with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium transformed with the Plasmodium berghei CS gene. These transformants constitutively express CS antigens and, when used to immunize mice orally, colonize the liver, induce antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity, and protect mice against sporozoite challenge in the absence of antisporozoite antibodies. These data indicate that the CS protein contains T cell epitopes capable of inducing protective cell-mediated immunity, and emphasize the importance of proper antigen presentation in generating this response. Analogous, orally administered vaccines against human malaria might be feasible.\r"

With the described technique, the results of the present studies demonstrate the feasibility of donor lung procurement and preservation for transplantation after cardiac donation. Use of this method will allow the most effective and efficient use of the limited supply of donor organs and thereby permit therapeutic single lung transplantation in selected patients. Cardiac donation should no longer preclude lung donation as it has in the past.\r"

  ".U": "88178410\r", 
  ".W": "The results of recent studies clearly support a cardiopulmonary impairment resulting from pectus excavatum, but resolving the apparent discrepancies between studies is necessary. Several factors must be taken into consideration. The severity of the deformity of the chest wall must be defined, whether by the sternovertebral distance or by various means proposed by others. Without some index of the degree of sternal depression, it is impossible to compare patients or results among studies. No study has enrolled a sufficient number of patients to provide an accurate correlation between the severity of the deformity and the extent of the cardiopulmonary deficit, nor has any defined how severe the deformity must be to result in cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The second factor that is important in evaluating results is what controls were used. Studies in which each patient functioned as his own control after surgical repair are preferable. In the pediatric age group where growth and increased pulmonary parameters would be expected, the follow-up studies should be performed at a defined time after surgical treatment. Studies completed years later cannot assess the effect of surgical repair upon cardiopulmonary function. Studies wherein persons matched for age and height to serve as controls are available from the same laboratory are also needed. The degree of co-operation and effort of patients will vary, particularly in the pediatric age group. Constancy of the experimental protocol and personnel is important. Least reliable are reports of experimental findings compared with standardized normal values. In early studies, measurements of vital capacity and total lung capacity produced variable results when compared with normal persons matched for age. The wide range of \"normal values\" makes statistical comparison difficult, if not impossible. A wide spectrum of cardiopulmonary function exists among individuals, depending upon prior physical training and body habitus. Sufficient physiologic reserve is generally present, such that extensive impairment must exist before patients become symptomatic at rest. Physiologic reserve during exercise is rapidly consumed and differences can be more readily determined. Exercise studies must go beyond the measurement of intracardiac pressures and pulmonary volumes at rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine whether Ado has a direct effect on myocardial glucose uptake, a recirculating, constant-flow, isolated rat-heart preparation was used. The hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution with an initial glucose concentration of 11 mmol/L. A control group was compared with hearts treated with Ado infusions (50 and 100 micrograms/min) or insulin (100, 200, and 300 microU/ml). In a separate series of experiments, nitroprusside was used to evaluate the effect of a nonspecific coronary vasodilator. The rate of glucose uptake was calculated as the amount of glucose removed from the perfusate normalized for heart weight and time. Developed pressure (DP) was assessed with an intraventricular balloon, and the coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) was monitored. At the end of 1 hour, the hearts were freeze-clamped and adenine nucleotide content was measured with HPLC. Ado treatment increased glucose uptake by 80% and 140%, respectively, at the two infusion rates (p less than 0.001). Myocardial adenosine triphosphate content was 18% and 26% higher in the Ado-treated hearts than in the controls (p less than 0.001). Ado also decreased the mean DP by 30% and 36% (p less than 0.001) and decreased CPP by 10% and 22%, respectively (p less than 0.001). Insulin increased glucose uptake in a similar dose response fashion but had no effect on myocardial nucleotide content, DP, or CPP. Nitroprusside decreased CPP but had no effect on glucose uptake, adenine nucleotide content, or DP. These results suggest that Ado may have a direct effect on glucose uptake independent of its properties as a coronary vasodilator.\r"

Malignant lesions represent only 10% of these tumors. Malignancy associated with pregnancy is even more rare. We present the fourth case of malignant pheochromocytoma and pregnancy to be reported in the literature. Surgery remains the mainstay of therapy. If the disorder is diagnosed early in pregnancy, surgical exploration should be considered after rapid medical control. If diagnosis is made later in pregnancy, medical control for the duration of the pregnancy should be attempted. Labor and vaginal delivery should be avoided because of an associated high morbidity and mortality. Cesarean section is recommended, once fetal maturity has been reached. Localization and definitive resection may be performed after delivery if exploration was not performed at the time of cesarean section. Although the prognosis of patients with malignant pheochromocytomas remains poor, there is hope of improving this prognosis in the future with use of new radiopharmaceutical agents and, possibly, new chemotherapy. Currently, aggressive surgical management not only appears to offer excellent palliation but likely prolongs survival of patients with malignant pheochromocytomas in selected cases.\r"

Ten patients received adrenaline 0.5 mg (0.5 ml) and 10 terbutaline 0.5 mg (0.5 ml) subcutaneously. Further treatment with nebulised salbutamol (5 mg), hydrocortisone (200 mg), and aminophylline (0.9 mg/kg/hour) was started 15 minutes later. All patients reported a reduction in chest tightness within three minutes of receiving both adrenaline and terbutaline and reported no adverse effects. Mean baseline values of peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) did not differ significantly between the adrenaline group (130 1 min-1 and 0.83 l) and the terbutaline group (111 1 min-1 and 0.63 l). After administration of adrenaline PEF had increased by 21% and FEV1 by 40% five minutes after the injection, and by 35% and 64% at 15 minutes. Terbutaline caused a 23% increase in PEF and a 37% increase in FEV1 at five minutes, and a 40% and 58% increase at 15 minutes. There was no significant difference in PEF, FEV1, heart rate, blood pressure, or pulsus paradoxus between the two groups at any time. Continuous electrocardiographic recording showed no abnormalities in either group. Thus in this study subcutaneous adrenaline (0.5 mg) and terbutaline (0.5 mg) produced effective rapid bronchodilatation without serious side effects.\r"

Cutaneous sensation in the leg and ankle was assessed 48 hours, seven days, and six to eight weeks after surgery, and a final comparison of the cosmetic effects and sensory perception after one year or more was made in 37 patients. There were no major differences between the groups at 48 hours in sensory abnormalities (anaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, and pain) but sensory recovery was significantly better in group 2 at the second and third assessments.

We conclude that cutaneous sensation is better preserved by repairing the leg incision in a single layer. Subcutaneous sutures may produce neuropraxia of the long saphenous nerve by direct pressure as healing progresses.\r"

Histological examination of these lesions confirmed that these so called mycetomas were masses of devitalized lung tissue infiltrated with fungus. The term mycotic lung sequestrum is therefore proposed to distinguish this condition from a fungus ball arising in a previously formed cavity. A review of 34 similar cases reported previously showed that haemoptysis occurred in about half of the cases and was fatal in just over half of these. Medical treatment appears to have little impact on survival and early consideration of surgical intervention is important.\r"

In an investigation of the role of leucocytes in connective tissue derangements in the lung, inflammatory leucocytes were generated in rat lungs by intratracheal instillation of inflammatory agents and retrieved by bronchoalveolar lavage. The proteolytic activities of control macrophages and of two inflammatory cell populations were compared; iodinated collagen, laminin, and fibronectin matrices were used. The inflammatory cells caused consistently and substantially more degradation of the matrices than the controls on a per cell basis. The oxidant scavengers superoxide dismutase and catalase did not inhibit matrix degradation, but alpha 1 protease inhibitor and alpha 2 macroglobulin were inhibitory. It is concluded that matrix damage in this assay is enhanced by inflammatory cells and is mediated principally by serine protease activity.\r"

Pathology data on 289 endarterectomy specimens from five participating centers and the corresponding angiography and B-mode ultrasonography data provided a basis for scrutinizing the validity of using the morphologic measurements as a standard. Discrepancies of greater than 1 mm between pathology and angiography measurements of minimum residual lumen occurred in 35% of the cases and between pathology and B-mode ultrasonography measurements in 64% of the cases. Discrepancies of greater than 1 mm between pathology- and angiography-measured lesion width occurred in 81% of the cases and between pathology and B-mode ultrasonography measurements in 64% of the cases. The cases representing mismatches of greater than 1 mm at one participating center were subjected to a rigorous review, with remeasurement of all morphologic features, in an attempt to explain the discrepancies. Various types of artifactual distortion of the specimens, the presence of slit-like and occluded lumens that were likely related to loss of perfusion pressure, and an inability to match planes of interrogation used in angiography and B-mode ultrasonography with pathology planes contributed significantly to the existence of mismatches. On the other hand, fixation and decalcification produced minimal and insignificant distortional changes. We conclude that the acquisition of quantitative data from endarterectomy specimens and the acceptance of morphologic data as a standard are limited by a number of problems that can be defined but have been difficult to resolve.\r"

Samples of harvested bone marrows purposely contaminated with an isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis demonstrated a bactericidal property that was maximal early after bone marrow collection. Bone marrow collection and ex vivo manipulation may result in considerable bacterial contamination. Procedures must be developed to assure that marrow collection and processing do not result in clinically significant contamination.\r"

  ".W": "Studies on 24 Wr(a+b+) and 23 Wr(a-b+) blood samples, using anti-Wrb in the enzyme-linked antiglobulin test (ELAT), have shown that Wr(a+b+) red cells bind, on average, a little over half the amount of anti-Wrb bound by Wr(a-b+) red cells. Similarly, ELAT studies using six different anti-Wra and 10 Wr(a+b+) samples, as well as red cells from the original Wr(a+b-) proposita, have shown that Wr(a+b+) red cells bind about half the amount of anti-Wra bound by Wr(a+b-) red cells. Various pitfalls that can arise when the ELAT is used to measure antigen ratios on red cells have been avoided but are described. This conclusive evidence that Wra and Wrb have an antithetical relationship is discussed in light of the knowledge that a ficin-resistant portion of MN sialoglycoprotein (SGP), when carried in liposomes, can inhibit anti-Wrb. It is possible that Wra, Wrb, or both may encode a post-translational change in MN SGP, or production of transferases that glycosylate membrane lipids that affect in situ orientation of MN SGP, or production of protein band 3 that then forms a complex with MN SGP at the red cell membrane surface.\r"

Ficin-modified St(a+) but not St(a-) red cells were agglutinated by monoclonal antibodies NN5 (anti-N) and 31 (detecting a sialic acid-dependent determinant on the SGPs). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed three periodic acid-Schiff-staining protein bands in ficin-modified St(a+) but not St(a-) red cell-membranes; these bands bound monoclonal antibodies NN5 and 31 on Western blots. Using Scatchard analysis of 125I-NN5 IgG binding to M+N- red cells, estimates were obtained of 25,000 Ss SGP molecules per red cell per s allele, 33,000 Ss SGP molecules per red cell per S allele, and 75,000 hybrid SGP molecules per red cell per hybrid allele. These results are consistent with the expression of the hybrid SGP gene at a level intermediate between the MN SGP gene and the Ss SGP gene. Monoclonal antibodies NN5 and 31 may be useful in screening ficin-treated red cells for hybrid SGP variants.\r"

Serum samples collected during and after DST were tested for cytotoxic antibodies against T and B lymphocytes of the donors and 30 normal individuals. Eleven recipients did not produce cytotoxic antibodies to the antigens of their DST donors, and eight produced cold and/or warm, broadly reactive B-cell antibodies. Six patients (24%) produced HLA-A, B, C, and/or DR antibodies. Three of these individuals produced antibodies after two immunizations, while others required three immunizations. Three of the 11 antibody nonproducers (17%) had not received previous transfusions, as compared to three of the eight antibody producers (43%). Comparison of HLA profiles revealed 22 percent of the HLA-A, B, DR identities between the transfusion donor and recipient in antibody nonproducers as compared to 9 percent of the HLA-A, B, DR identities in antibody producers. The HLA-A2, B40, DR4 haplotype and HLA-DRW6 antigen were more common among antibody producers than among nonproducers, who had an excess of the HLA-B8, DR3 haplotype. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that there may be high- and low-responder HLA haplotypes that control immunologic responsiveness to histocompatibility antigens.\r"

Sera testing repeatedly reactive (RR) were further tested by two Western blots (WB) and by two radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPA). There were 176 (0.44%) EIA IR and 68 (0.17%) RR results. On WBs, 10 of the 68 EIA RR sera demonstrated reactivity to HTLV-1 gag gene-encoded core protein p24, with or without reactivity to other core proteins (p19, p28, p53/55). These ten sera were the only ones demonstrating reactivity on RIPAs to other HTLV-1 gene products - env gene-encoded glycoproteins gp46, gp61/68, or tat gene-encoded HTLV-1 transcriptional activator p40x. These ten sera were interpreted as positive for HTLV-1 antibodies. Of the remaining 58 EIA RR sera, 21 were negative by WBs and RIPAs, 37 sera demonstrated reactivity to various combinations of p19, p28, and p53/55, but not to p24 on WBs. These 37 sera were interpreted as \"indeterminate\", because they were negative by RIPAs. We conclude that: 1) EIA testing and WB/RIPA verification identified 10 (0.025%) HTLV-1 infected individuals among 39,898 low-risk blood donors; 2) anti-p24 may be a more sensitive and specific indicator of HTLV-1 infection than antibodies to p19, p28, or p53/55; and 3) presently, both WB and RIPA are needed to verify HTLV-1 EIA reactivity.\r"

Our follow-up study comprises 135 of these patients. Of these patients, 78 tumors were completely resected, and 61 were incompletely resected. When a proportional-hazards model (Cox) was applied, there was a statistically significant difference between the recurrence rates for the two drugs. On the basis of recurrence rates per 100 patient-months, both BCG (1.2) and ADR (0.9) worked well with completely resected tumors. However, for incomplete resections, the recurrence rate for BCG (0.9) was less than half that for ADR (1.9). The overall recurrence rates were 1.1 and 1.3 for BCG and ADR, respectively. There have been 42 failures of treatment with either BCG or ADR. We defined failure as any recurrence of tumor; progression of the cancer in stage, grade, tumor number or size; or any residual tumor after 18 treatments (14 months of therapy). As to the failures in patients whom we followed up, and whose treatment was either switched from ADR to BCG or continued on further BCG treatment, 53 per cent have achieved complete remission. Complete remission for BCG and ADR were 76 per cent and 52 per cent, respectively. Of the various factors considered in the study, only tumor grade and treatment drug were statistically significant. The cystectomy rate was 1 per cent for BCG-treated patients and 0 for ADR-treated patients.\r"

In the present study 65 men, aged 61-65 years, with impaired glucose tolerance were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study over 12 weeks evaluating the effects of 0.75 microgram alphacalcidol, a synthetic analog to the active metabolite of vitamin D. In the 26 patients with blood pressure greater than or equal to 150/90 mmHg before treatment a significant reduction (p less than 0.01) of both the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure was found after therapy (from 171/95 to 150/88 mmHg). The effect was additive to concomitant antihypertensive treatment and was correlated (p = 0.03) to a reduction of serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Also in the whole group of patients given alphacalcidol blood pressure was moderately lowered from a mean of 152/87 +/- 22/10 (SD) to 143/84 +/- 17/8 mmHg. There were no relationships between the changes in body weight, blood glucose or insulin parameters and the changes in blood pressure during the trial. The findings are compatible with the concept that calcium metabolism influences blood pressure regulation and suggest that supplementation with a physiologic dose of active vitamin D could be beneficial for patients with high blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "This study reports the mortality over a 5-year-period determined a double-blind trial, which evaluated the effect of early intervention with metoprolol in suspected acute myocardial infarction. In all, there were 1,395 randomized patients, 698 and 697 of whom were allocated to metoprolol 200 mg daily and placebo treatments, respectively, for the first 3 months. Thereafter, the two groups were treated in a similar fashion implying beta-blockade to a majority. Within the first 3 months, mortality in the metoprolol group was 5.7% versus 8.9% of the placebo group (p = 0.02). This difference persisted after 2 years (metoprolol 13.2%; placebo 17.2%; p = 0.04). Over a 5-year-period, 24.2% of the patients who originally were allocated to metoprolol had died as compared to 25.7% of those originally allocated to placebo (p greater than 0.2). Among patients in whom treatment started early (less than or equal to 8 hours after onset of pain = the median delay time), enzyme activities in the metoprolol group was lower (p = 0.03) than in the placebo group. Mortality during the first 2 years among these patients treated early was lower in the metoprolol (11.8%) than in the placebo group (17.3%; p = 0.04). Corresponding figures after 5 years were 22.0% and 25.3%, respectively (p greater than 0.2). Among patients in whom treatment started later than 8 hours onset of pain, there was neither any difference in enzyme activity nor in mortality after 2 and 5 years. It can be concluded that early treatment with metoprolol in suspected acute myocardial infarction reduced mortality during the first 3 months compared with placebo. The difference persisted after 2 years. However, 5 years after randomization, no significant difference in mortality was observed between the two treatment groups.\r"

A 66-year-old female is described, who developed an aortic occlusion, renovascular hypertension and uremia. She was cured with a bifurcation graft and a patch angioplasty of a stenotic renal artery and nephrectomy of the contralateral kidney with an occluded artery without refilling. A literature survey is made of patients older than 40 years.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy and reproducibility of caliper and cinevideodensitometric measurements of coronary stenotic dimensions were compared in radiographic phantom models and in coronary arteriograms of 28 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. Projected, single-plane coronary cine frames were analyzed by a computer-assisted videodensitometric method, which measures stenotic cross-sectional area without assumptions about lesion geometry. The accuracy (2.4%) and precision (+/- 1.9%) of cinevideodensitometry for measuring percent area stenosis in Plexiglas models of eccentric stenotic lesions was superior to the accuracy (24.7%) and precision (+/- 5.4%) of caliper measurements. Interobserver variability was significantly (p less than 0.05) better for cinevideodensitometric (r = 0.98; SEE = 6.4%) than for caliper measurements (r = 0.87; SEE = 13.1%). After angioplasty, percent diameter stenosis measured by calipers fell from 70 +/- 12% to 30 +/- 15%. Mean percent area reduction measured by cinevideodensitometry fell from 89.1 +/- 8% to 40.1 +/- 22% and stenotic area increased five-fold, from 0.59 +/- 0.5 to 3.47 +/- 1.6 mm2. Pre and post PTCA gradients did not correlate with lesion dimensions. Cinevideodensitometric measurements of absolute stenotic dimensions were more reproducible than relative measurements expressed as a percentage, due to the tapered caliber of normal arterial segments. Thus, cinevideodensitometric measurements were more accurate and reproducible than caliper measurements. The angiographic effects of coronary angioplasty are best measured by cinevideodensitometry, because residual lesions post PTCA are often eccentric, have indistinct margins, and are better characterized by changes in area than by changes in diameter.\r"

Therapy with both regimens was equally effective in lowering blood pressure compared to placebo. Mean antihypertensive dose of lisinopril was lower when given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide than when given alone (48 +/- 6 vs 68 +/- 12 mg daily). Plasma renin activity increased in both groups of patients, but more in group B (p less than 0.05). Plasma aldosterone concentrations and serum uric acid levels were also higher in the group receiving lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide (p less than 0.05). Serum potassium concentrations were unaffected in either group. The incidence of side effects was similar in groups A and B (44% and 38%, respectively). This study suggests that lisinopril alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension without any major side effects.\r"

Each drug was administered once daily for 24 weeks in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken 24 hours after dosing. Each drug produced significant (p less than 0.01) reductions in mean supine diastolic BP. The mean decrease in supine diastolic BP with betaxolol was significantly greater at weeks 4, 6, 10 and 12 (p less than 0.05). Throughout the remainder of the trial (weeks 14 to 24), no significant differences in BP reduction were noted between treatment groups. Normotension (supine diastolic BP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) was achieved in 72% of those given betaxolol compared with 52% of those given atenolol (p less than 0.05). The most common side effects noted were bradycardia, fatigue and headache. The incidence of these and of central nervous system side effects was similar between the betaxolol and atenolol groups. Both agents were well tolerated. At recommended doses, betaxolol once daily may be more effective than atenolol once daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.\r"

Compared with normal hearts, the transplanted denervated and the recipient innervated hearts in the heterotopic group showed higher average HRs over the whole 24 hours, the waking and sleeping periods. The rates of the denervated and the recipient hearts did not differ significantly. The maximal HR was similar in all 3 groups, but the minimal HR was lower in the normal hearts than in denervated and recipient hearts. The 24-hour RR interval variability was greatly reduced in the denervated hearts (60 +/- 22 ms) compared with the recipient (89 +/- 26 ms) and normal (151 +/- 38 ms) hearts. During arousal from sleep, the magnitude, time and rate of the HR change were significantly reduced in the denervated hearts compared with the innervated hearts and in the recipient compared with the normal hearts. These findings demonstrate that denervated hearts can show significant variations in HR during the 24-hour period, but to a lesser extent than normal hearts. The widest deviation from normal occurs during sleep, when the denervated heart shows minimal slowing probably due to lack of parasympathetic innervation. In heterotopic transplant recipients, the patients' own HR responses also are significantly blunted.\r"

The recordings were made in the apical 4-chamber view, using a 2.25-MHz transducer. The sample was placed approximately 1 cm proximal (left atrium) and 1 cm distal (left ventricle) from the middle of the anulus of the mitral valve at the onset of diastole. Processing of the raw Doppler spectra was done in a way that avoided subjective manipulation by the investigators. Mitral peak velocities, accelerations and spectral widths were measured in early diastole and late diastole. From the parameters under investigation, maximal velocities showed the best reproducibility with a range of coefficients of variation of 9 to 13%. Peak acceleration in early diastole and spectral widths showed rather large coefficients of variation, ranging from 19 to 30 and 14 to 24%, respectively. Mitral pulsed Doppler spectra in the left atrium were more reproducible than in the left ventricle.\r"

The peak-to-nadir swing of plasma glucose was greater with wheat flour than with cracked or whole grains. In vitro starch hydrolysis by pancreatic amylase was faster with decreasing particle size with all three cereals. Correlation with the in vivo data was imperfect. Oat-based meals evoked smaller glucose and insulin responses than wheat- or maize-based meals. Particle size influences the digestion rate and consequent metabolic effects of wheat and maize but not oats. The increased insulin response to finely ground flour may be relevant to the etiology of diseases associated with hyperinsulinemia and to the management of diabetes.\r"

Avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex methods were used for identifying keratin, vimentin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and secretory component (SC) on deparaffinized tissue sections. Keratin was positive in 29% of well differentiated adenocarcinoma, significantly lower than in moderately or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Likely, vimentin was positive in 27% of well differentiated adenocarcinoma, significantly lower than in moderately or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. SC was positive in 66% of well differentiated adenocarcinoma, significantly higher than in moderately or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. In the subtyping of well differentiated adenocarcinomas, keratin showed higher positive results in the bronchial surface epithelial, goblet cell, and bronchial gland types than in the Clara cell or type II alveolar epithelial cell type. These findings suggest that immunoperoxidase stains for keratin, vimentin, and SC may be useful for determining the degree of differentiation of adenocarcinomas of the lung as well as for subtyping of well differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinomas.\r"

Of 54 specimens positive for CMV, 36 were positive by both IFA and CPE, 3 were positive by CPE only, and 15 were positive by IFA only (P less than 0.01 by the chi-square test). Failure to detect CMV associated CPE in 10 of these 15 samples was probably due to concomitant infection with herpes simplex virus or heavy bacterial or fungal contamination. Nine of the 13 patients with IFA-positive CPE-negative specimens had CMV infection documented by other positive cultures. It was concluded that the shell vial IFA rapid technique for detection of CMV is highly specific, more sensitive than conventional isolation, and well suited for application in a clinical virology laboratory.\r"

One commercial antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) was tested and found to give sensitive and specific staining, with only a few false negatives and no false positives. Of three antibodies to HBsAg, one gave good staining results that were consistent with serologic data; one had many false positive stains due to contaminating antibodies to plasma proteins; and one (a monoclonal antibody) had many false negatives, probably due to its restricted antigenic specificity. Diagnosticians should be aware of the problems with false positive and false negative immunohistochemical stains. False positives in particular can be a significant problem, causing frequent misdiagnosis of hepatitis B.\r"

All were men in the age range 28-61 years (mean, 38.8 years). Four had blood alcohol levels of 0.09-0.28 g % at autopsy, and five of six were comatose or dead within 30 min of the initiating trauma. Traumatic ruptures of otherwise normal extra- and intracranial arteries were identified in four cases. The site of rupture was not found in one case, and the final case had rupture of a fibrotic intracranial vertebral artery. Multiple sites of incomplete and complete rupture were found in four cases. Postmortem angiography was used in one case to demonstrate the site of rupture prior to removal of the brain. Postmortem angiography and careful gross and histologic examination of extra- and intracranial cerebral arteries is recommended in all cases of basal subarachnoid hemorrhage where minor trauma to the head or neck has occurred prior to collapse or death, especially if the decedent was intoxicated at the time of the trauma.\r"

This study looked retrospectively at the histological features of liver disease in this population, and prospectively at the clinical and biochemical features of liver disease associated with renal transplantation. In all patients, infection with hepatitis B was excluded. Six deaths, primarily attributable to hepatic failure have occurred: one, acute herpes simplex infection; one, subacute massive hepatic necrosis of uncertain etiology; two, pretransplant liver disease; and two, posttransplantation cirrhosis of uncertain etiology. Review of the hepatic histology of 26 patients with known liver disease following transplantation revealed a wide range of pathologies with few specific correlations with their clinical status or biochemical tests of liver function. The prevalence of hepatic dysfunction following transplantation in our patient population was assessed by prospective biochemical screening of 111 transplant recipients over a 6-month interval. During this time period, 27 patients (24%) displayed biochemical evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Liver disease was known to have predated transplantation in only three of 27. Episodes of abnormal liver function occasionally occurred during an identifiable acute illness (six of 27), although the majority (21 of 27) had chronic hepatic dysfunction. Transplant recipients with abnormal liver function could not be differentiated from a cohort with normal liver function on the basis of age, sex, duration of graft function, or alcohol/drug intake. The possible etiologies of nonhepatitis B liver dysfunction following renal transplantation are discussed, and the high prevalence of biochemical evidence of hepatic dysfunction in this population free of hepatitis B infection is emphasized.\r"

  ".W": "When glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) is infused, glucose supplies most of the energy demands of the heart. Fatty acid becomes the major substrate during fasting, pathologically increased work loads or insulin deficiency. Myocardial purine breakdown reflects myocardial energy status and influences coronary tone. Ischemia accelerates breakdown of ATP to AMP, which is further metabolized to adenosine, which causes vasodilatation and a blunted response to catecholamines. If normal circulation is restored, ADP and AMP are rapidly converted to ATP and purine metabolism is changed from degradation to salvage and de novo synthesis of purines. Ischemia impairs mitochondrial function, causing decreased capacity to oxidize fatty acids once aerobic conditions return. Thus, reperfusion with elevated plasma free fatty acids results in acyl-CoA accumulation in the heart. In diabetic animals, phosphorylation of AMP to ATP is defective in the heart, and AMP degradation is increased. Therefore, careful regulation of the blood sugar with concomitant lowering of plasma free fatty acids in diabetics with ischemic heart disease should improve myocardial salvage by preserving and repleting myocardial ATP. Thus, along with reestablishment of coronary flow and reduction in myocardial oxygen demands, may significantly reduce the morbidity of acute ischemia in diabetics.\r"

Microorganisms cultured from the endocervix or intraoperatively from the endometrium or abdominal wall operative sites were comparable for the two groups. In this multicenter study, the difference between the percentage of patients receiving cefotetan who did not develop clinical signs and symptoms of infection (93%) and the percentage of patients receiving cefoxitin (85%) considered clinical successes was statistically significant (p = 0.02, chi 2). The bacteriologic response rate for patients taking cefotetan was also significantly higher than that for patients taking cefoxitin (93% versus 85%, p = 0.03). Isolates recovered from the endocervix, endometrium, or operative site were comparable for the two groups. Both drugs were well tolerated. In this evaluation, cefotetan administered in a single dose of 1 gm was more effective as a prophylactic agent than multiple 2 gm doses of cefoxitin in the reduction of infectious morbidity in this large series of patients undergoing cesarean section.\r"

The rate of clinical failure for the cefotetan group was 8.5% and 12.2% for the cefoxitin group. Laboratory and clinical adverse reactions were infrequent and none was serious; both antimicrobials were well tolerated.

Most of the infections were community acquired, were associated with gastrointestinal tract perforation, and were caused by both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The median duration of therapy was 6 days for each group. The clinical response rate for the 95 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group was 98%, and that for the 43 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group was 95%. Bacteriologically, 97% of the 58 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 89% of the 27 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group had a satisfactory or presumed satisfactory response; two patients in the cefotetan group and three in the cefoxitin group were considered bacteriologic failures. Cefotetan was as effective as cefoxitin in eradicating Bacteroides fragilis and other species of Bacteroides, Clostridium sp., and gram-negative bacilli. The incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions for cefotetan (27%) was not statistically different from that for cefoxitin (17%). No clinically significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in changes in the results of clinical laboratory tests performed before and after treatment; a decrease in hematocrit among the cefotetan group was statistically greater (p = 0.04) than that for the cefoxitin group, and a decrease in serum creatinine level for the cefoxitin group was greater than that for the cefotetan group (p = 0.02). Cefotetan may represent an effective, safe, and cost-saving alternative to cefoxitin for the prompt treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections.\r"

These antibodies recognized PR, as demonstrated by a downfield shift in the radiolabeled progestin binding peak when KD68 or JZB39 was added to high salt sucrose density gradients. The specificity of both antibodies for PR was confirmed with Western immunoblots and competition studies performed with purified receptor. Progesterone receptor was identified with these antibodies and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique in the nuclei of epithelial cells, stromal cells, and myometrial smooth muscle cells. The receptor content of endometrial epithelium and stroma varied with the menstrual cycle. The variation was most marked in the epithelium, which demonstrated very strong PR immunostaining during the proliferative phase and postovulation Days 1-3 of the early secretory phase, but PR immunostaining decreased sharply at postovulation Day 4 and remained relatively weak or absent during the mid and late secretory phase. In contrast, stromal cell nuclei were moderately to strongly immunostained even during the secretory phase. Progesterone receptor was not localized in vascular smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells. Specific cytoplasmic staining for PR was not identified in any of these cases, even prior to ovulation, when circulating levels of progesterone are low, indicating that both the steroid-occupied and -unoccupied forms of human progesterone receptor, like rabbit and guinea pig PR, and estrogen receptor, is a nuclear protein.\r"

  ".W": "Normal human keratinocytes can be grown in serum-free medium, and the integrated control of their proliferation and differentiation can be modulated experimentally. The growth of cultured human keratinocytes can also be specifically arrested at either reversible or irreversible growth arrest states. Reversible growth arrest is induced by culture in medium containing TGF-beta or ethionine or in medium deficient of isoleucine. Irreversible growth arrest is induced by culture in razoxane-containing medium or by routine passage of keratinocytes until senescence results. The current studies were performed to determine from which growth arrest states keratinocyte differentiation occurs. Cells were therefore growth-arrested at each state, and they were then incubated in several different differentiation-promoting culture conditions. The results show that differentiation, as determined by morphologic, cytochemical, and immunofluorescent assays, can be induced from multiple reversible and irreversible growth arrest states by a series of complex biologic mechanisms. More specifically, at least three distinct stages appear to be involved in the process of keratinocyte differentiation. First, cells arrest their growth at a reversible predifferentiation state. Second, cells irreversibly lose their proliferative potential. Finally, cells express the terminally differentiated keratinocyte phenotype.\r"

However, immunohistochemical studies on normal or tumor tissues have shown conflicting findings on its subcellular distribution. By using various fixation procedures on cytospin preparations of HL60 cells, the authors found the subcellular distribution of the c-myc protein to be dependent on the method of fixation. When studying mouse tissues in frozen sections using a biotinylated monoclonal antibody against the c-myc protein, they found the protein to be widely distributed in various normal adult mouse tissues, in most cases localized to the nucleus. However, when these tissues were studied after formalin fixation and paraffin embedding, a loss of nuclear staining was observed concurrent with the appearance of c-myc protein immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm. It is concluded that immunohistochemical studies on the expression of this oncogene should take into consideration the effects of fixation when its subcellular distribution is being examined.\r"

These morphologic changes, referred to as Schuffner's dots, are important in the identification of this species of malarial parasite and have been associated by electron microscopy with caveolavesicle complexes along the erythrocyte plasmalemma. We have produced a monoclonal antibody (MAb A 20) that identifies an antigen in Plasmodium vivax-infected erythrocytes that is associated with the caveola-vesicle complexes of the parasitized host cell. This monoclonal antibody reacts with air-dried P vivax-infected erythrocytes to produce a pattern by the indirect immunofluorescence test (IFT) that is evocative of Schuffner's dots. Immunoelectron microscopy of P vivax-infected human erythrocytes using MAb A 20 confirmed the location of this antigen within vesicles of caveola-vesicle complexes. On Western blots MAb A 20 recognized four polypeptides of 54, 64, 72, and 86 kd. MAb A 20 reacted by IFT with 90% of Sri Lankan isolates and with a Brazilian P vivax isolate, which indicates that the epitope identified by this monoclonal is conserved.\r"

Children aged 5-10 years were matched for age, weight, and presence of splenomegaly then randomly assigned to receive either proguanil (equivalent of 200 mg daily adult dose) or chloroquine (equivalent of 300 mg base weekly). All medications were administered by the investigators and malaria smears were performed on a weekly basis. Among 85 children taking proguanil for 524 human-weeks, there were 17 cases of falciparum malaria and 11 cases of vivax. Of 85 children on chloroquine for 537 human-weeks, there were 24 cases of falciparum and 1 case of vivax. There were no statistically significant differences between the two regimens when analyzed either as suppressive or as causal Plasmodium falciparum prophylactics. The data were suggestive that proguanil may have some causal prophylactic effect against falciparum malaria. There were significantly more vivax prophylactic failures (P less than 0.01) in the proguanil group. Side effects were infrequent, mild, and comparable in both groups.\r"

The present study compared clinical and parasitological efficacy and side effects of C25 and C50 in children less than or equal to 5 years of age. In vitro studies with chloroquine, mefloquine, pyrimethamine, and quinine were also performed. Ninety children were given a 3-day treatment of C25 and 48 a 5-day treatment of C50. Cases were followed for a total of 15 days (D0 to D14). At day 14, 73% of the C25 and 67% of the C50 children were still parasitemic, but the mean geometric parasite density had decreased by at least 96% in both groups. Clinically, 44 C25 and 12 C50 children had fever on day 0; by day 14 only 4 (9%) C25 and 4 (33%) C50 children still had fever. Side effects were found to be minimal. The chloroquine in vitro tests corroborated the in vivo findings. P. falciparum was found to be quite sensitive to mefloquine and quinine, but showed a high (59%) resistance to pyrimethamine.\r"

Using the hamster cheek pouch-cerebral malaria model, we tested the hypothesis that dexamethasone is effective as a therapeutic agent in severe malaria if given before some yet undefined trigger point in the disease. Infected hamsters were treated with dexamethasone (0.7 mg/kg) daily on days 7-12, 4-12, or 1-12 post-challenge. When treatment was started on day 1, whole body oxygen consumption (used as a measure of erythrocyte transport to sites of diffusion) on day 12 was greater than (P less than 0.05) that of infected control animals, though the degree of anemia was no different in treated and untreated groups. Furthermore, treatment produced a reduction in monocyte accumulation, capillary malfunction, and monocyte/red blood cell aggregate formation observable in the cheek pouch in vivo and a similar reduction in monocyte presence, capillary pathologic change, and multifocal hemorrhage in the brain on postmortem. These data suggest that mediator(s), whose production can be blocked by pretreatment with dexamethasone, are involved in the pathogenesis of disease leading to death of the Plasmodium berghei infected hamster.\r"

Most of the antigens occurred predominantly in mature asexual parasites, two were abundant in ring stages and three were absent in rings. Four of the 12 antigens were detected in asexual stages but not in gametocytes. Grouping of antigens by localization within blood stages was difficult because of the complexity of fluorescence patterns observed. With some antibodies, fluorescence was apparently distributed evenly over the parasites, but in other cases label was concentrated within discrete compartments or organelles. Extraparasitic intraerythrocytic fluorescence was also observed.\r"

The toxic effects of the major basic and cationic proteins were inhibited by the polyanions heparin and dextran sulfate, in keeping with the cationic nature of these proteins, or by heat denaturation, suggesting that molecular conformation was also relevant. The lytic activity of the neurotoxin was not inhibited by heating at 56 degrees C for 4 hr, establishing an additional difference with the eosinophil cationic protein. Heparin had only a slight inhibitory effect on the toxicity of the neurotoxin, and dextran sulfate was inactive even at 25 mg/ml. Although both the eosinophil cationic protein and the neurotoxin possess ribonuclease activity, only the toxicity of the latter was abolished by the ribonuclease inhibitor RNasin (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) or by a competitive substrate, yeast ribonucleic acid. Eosinophil peroxidase significantly increased the extent of trypomastigote or amastigote killing by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of iodide. This effect was abrogated by sodium azide, bovine serum albumin, or gelatin, known inhibitors of the eosinophil peroxidase + halide + hydrogen peroxide system. These results suggest that the destruction of T. cruzi trypomastigotes and amastigotes by eosinophils may result from toxic mechanisms involving several granule proteins.\r"

Barrier methods should also be used when drugs that interfere with oral contraceptives are prescribed. Oral contraceptives and anticoagulants should not be given together because of the chemical changes in the blood caused by the steroid content of the contraceptive.

Renal free water excretion is often impaired in end-stage liver disease and not responsive to routine diuretic therapy, predisposing these patients to accumulation of extravascular lung water. The effects of the intraoperative use of continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH) on cardiopulmonary and oxygen transport variables were studied in ten patients during and 24 hours after OLT. CAVH prevented increases in pulmonary shunt fraction while decreasing PEEP and FIO2 requirements. Pulmonary compliance was significantly higher after operation in patients receiving CAVH. Before surgical dissection, hemodynamic effects of CAVH were minimal. Postoperatively, patients having CAVH had lower cardiac filling pressures and more normal systemic vascular resistance than did patients not having CAVH. These data suggest that CAVH may be a useful intraoperative technique for patients with impaired renal function undergoing liver transplantation.\r"

Forty-four per cent of the untreated control patients and 61% of the patients pretreated with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent had normal preoperative electrocardiograms and no risk factors for coronary artery disease other than hypertension (this difference between groups was not statistically significant). During tracheal intubation and/or emergence from anesthesia, a brief, self-limited episode of myocardial ischemia was detected in 11 of 39 untreated control patients, and in two of 89 patients pretreated with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (P less than 0.001). Tachycardia always accompanied the ischemic events, but a conspicuous increase in blood pressure did not. The authors conclude that mild hypertension, when untreated prior to the induction of anesthesia, is associated with a high incidence of myocardial ischemia; and that a single small oral dose of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, given with pre-medication, can significantly reduce that risk.\r"

Plasma samples were obtained at these times for analysis of six-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) concentration by radioimmunoassay. Group II patients received ibuprofen 12 mg/kg orally 1 1/2 h before surgery. Plasma samples from six group I patients and all group II patients taken 5 min after mesenteric traction were added to isolated helical strips of cat superior mesenteric arteries precontracted with norepinephrine (200 ng/ml) for analysis of reduction in developed force. In group I, abdominal mesenteric traction resulted in a significant decrease in MAP (P less than 0.03) and SVR (P less than 0.005) with an increase in CO (P less than 0.05) at 5 min post-mesenteric traction, which returned to mean pre-mesenteric traction values by 30 min and a significant increase in PGF1 alpha concentrations. There was a significant positive correlation between PGF1 alpha and CO (P less than 0.001) and a significant negative correlation between PGF1 alpha and SVR (P less than 0.01) at 5 min post-mesenteric traction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the last two decades, considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the mechanisms of pain. Studies correlating subjective magnitude estimations of pain in man with activity in single nerve fibers in experimental animals, and microneurographic recordings in awake humans, have provided convincing evidence for the role of specific nociceptors and labelled lines for signalling pain sensation in the normal skin. The response properties of the different types of nociceptive afferents, both myelinated and unmyelinated, from skin, muscle, and joints make them ideal candidates for signalling pain sensations. Cutaneous inflammation from any cause results in hyperalgesia. Cutaneous hyperalgesia at the site of an injury, i.e., primary hyperalgesia, can be explained by sensitization of nociceptors. This sensitization is likely due to local release of chemical mediators in the inflamed area. The metabolites of arachidonic acid (eicasonoids) and bradykinin appear to play an important role in the sensitization of nociceptors. Similar inflammation-induced changes in response properties of fine articular afferents might explain the pain of acute arthritis. The neuropeptide substance P released from primary afferents may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of arthritis. The mechanism of hyperalgesia in the region surrounding the injury, i.e., secondary hyperalgesia, is less well understood, and probably results from changes both in the peripheral and central nervous systems. While considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the mechanisms of acute pain, the pathophysiology of most chronic pain states is still unclear. We hope that future studies in experimental animals, and careful psychophysical testing and microneurographic recordings in chronic pain patients, will lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of pain.\r"

Capillary perfusion as measured by transcutaneous oxygen monitoring remained relatively unaffected (p = 0.25). Cold-induced vasoconstriction and the recovery thereafter were not influenced. Diastolic blood pressure tended to decrease (p = 0.06), but there was no change in systolic blood pressure, forearm blood flow, and calculated forearm vascular resistance. The authors conclude that prostacyclin may have dissimilar vasoactive potencies in different vascular beds as shown by a pronounced increase in total skin blood flow, owing to vasodilation of shunt vessels, simultaneously with an insignificant change in nutritional skin blood flow and forearm muscle blood flow.\r"

Forty patients--31 men and 9 women with an average age of 62.98 +/- 10.65 years--were admitted to the study. All had a history of claudication for at least six months. The duration of the trial was eighteen weeks. After a washout period of two weeks the patients received either two times 400 mg naftidrofuryl or two identical placebo tablets daily for eight weeks. Subsequently a crossover from verum to placebo and vice versa was carried out and the alternative medication was administered for another eight weeks. Clinical results were evaluated by measuring painfree and maximal walking distance by treadmill test at a speed of 3.2 km/h and an inclination of 12 degrees. Systolic ankle pressure and brachial pressure were measured by Doppler ultrasound, and ankle/arm pressure ratio was calculated. Treadmill test, Doppler ultrasound examination, and laboratory data analysis were performed at the beginning of every study period, every four weeks during and at the end of the study. Results. The patients in both groups showed an initial homogeneity of age, risk factors, concomitant diseases, walking distance, and Doppler indices. After eight weeks naftidrofuryl resulted in a statistically significant increase in painfree (p less than 0.02) and maximal walking distance (p less than 0.05). The placebo-treated group showed only a slight, statistically nonsignificant increase in both painfree and maximal walking distance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Animal pharmacology studies showed that pirmenol is highly efficacious whether the arrhythmias were atrial or ventricular in origin; chemically, mechanically, or electrically induced; or of the automaticity or reentrant types. The conscious coronary artery-ligated (Harris) dog model best allowed simulation of a variety of clinical situations in which pirmenol could be used either alone or in combination. Pirmenol was highly effective by both the intravenous and oral routes, causing immediate suppression, prevention, or termination of cardiac arrhythmias. Preclinical studies in the dog showed an excellent correlation between the dose of pirmenol, plasma levels, and antiarrhythmic efficacy. Administration of pirmenol in the dog at intentionally accelerated infusion rates suggested a relatively wide margin of safety for pirmenol compared with other class I agents. In vitro electrophysiologic studies in dog Purkinje fibers revealed possibly unique differences of pirmenol from other antiarrhythmic agents. It depresses fast and slow response automaticity and its electrophysiologic effects were less variable than other class I drugs over a spectrum of potassium levels. To test the relevance of the in vitro electrophysiologic results, pirmenol's antiarrhythmic efficacy was assessed in several in vivo dog models in which serum potassium was either increased or decreased. Studies comparing pirmenol and disopyramide clearly showed a relative lack of serum potassium dependence for pirmenol, suggesting a potential clinical advantage over disopyramide and other antiarrhythmics in variable potassium settings. The clinical relevance of these observations will have to be established in patients with variable potassium levels. Overall, pirmenol compared favorably with other reference agents in efficacy and safety in extensive preclinical investigations.\r"

The author summarizes the hemodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies of pirmenol noting that its effects are relatively independent of potassium concentration. The drug's side effects profile is presented, and it is concluded that pirmenol is well tolerated. Hypotension has not been a significant problem with intravenous pirmenol. Precipitation or worsening of clinical heart failure appears to occur only rarely. The favorable pharmacokinetics of pirmenol permit dosage at less frequent intervals than with procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide. Pirmenol has shown efficacy for ventricular arrhythmias even in some patients refractory to Class Ia agents. Antiarrhythmic effects appear to be correlated with plasma levels, and a well-defined therapeutic minimum has been determined.\r"

The outstanding problem is identification of the patient at high risk for developing sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Decisions on administration of antiarrhythmic agents to post-MI patients have long been based solely on detection of ventricular ectopy. By now, however, it has become apparent that this approach has not favorably altered the incidence of sudden cardiac death and has exposed many asymptomatic patients needlessly to potentially toxic antiarrhythmic agents. At present, assessment of the benefit/risk ratio favors treating asymptomatic complex ventricular ectopy only in patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction, provided that treatment results in the adequate suppression of complex forms of the ventricular ectopy and does not produce deleterious effects. The benefit/risk ratio does not favor treatment of asymptomatic ventricular ectopy in other groups of post-(MI) patients. Improved methods of identifying patients requiring treatment are needed. Programmed ventricular stimulation and noninvasive interrogation of signal-averaged electrocardiograms are designed to detect the presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate and offer promise for improved identification of patients at risk for sudden cardiac death.\r"

Red cells should be used in addition to asanguinous fluids in the treatment of tissue hypoxia due to anemia. The need for whole blood as opposed to packed red blood cells is controversial. However, plasma should not be used as a volume expander, and its use to supplement coagulation factors during the massive transfusion of red cells should be guided by laboratory tests that document a coagulopathy. Similarly, platelet transfusions are indicated to correct documented thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction, and routine prophylaxis after fixed volumes of red cells results is unwarranted. Many anticipated complications of massive transfusions, including hemostatic abnormalities, acid-base imbalances, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia, are uncommon or of limited clinical significance. The risks of immune hemolysis and transfusion-transmitted diseases, on the other hand, are significant, and argue for judicious use of blood components. In emergencies in which blood is required immediately before compatibility testing can be completed, O-negative uncrossmatched blood can be requested. Careful blood specimen collection and patient identification prior to transfusion are critical. Practices that emphasize blood conservation, including the use of autologous salvaged blood, are always to the patient's advantage.\r"

High dose infusions of Group B Streptococcus (GBS), a neonatal pathogen, into newborn animals produce pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia, and reduced cardiac output similar to high dose endotoxin infusions in adult animals. To avoid the compounding effects of reduced arterial and mixed venous PO2, HPV was studied after low dose endotoxin in adult animals. We hypothesized that HPV would be attenuated in piglets after a low dose GBS infusion. Both PVR and pressure-flow (P/Q) relationships were measured in piglets to characterize the neonatal pulmonary vascular response to alveolar hypoxia before and after GBS infusion. Hemodynamic measurements were made under Zone 3 conditions in 5 piglets breathing room air and 13% FIO2: (1) prior to GBS, (2) 20 min into a 1-h infusion of 3 +/- 1 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h live GBS, (3) 1 h, and (4) 3 h after completion of the GBS infusion. Prior to GBS, alveolar hypoxia increased PVR (14 +/- 1.3 to 33 +/- 3.6 mm Hg/L/min) and P/Q slope (12 +/- 2.3 to 41 +/- 6.8 mm Hg/L/min). During all subsequent exposures to 13% FIO2, the PVR and P/Q slopes were similar to pre-GBS values. When animals breathed room air, the PVR and P/Q slopes were greater than pre-GBS values during but not after the GBS infusion. We conclude that HPV is not altered 1 and 3 h after a 1-h low dose GBS infusion in neonatal piglets. Infusion of GBS and alveolar hypoxia independently increase pulmonary vascular resistance.\r"

Arterial blood gas determinations, arterial blood pressure, and white blood cell counts were monitored serially for 12 h after the injection of either 2 x 10(9) E. coli J96 or saline. Lung water, albumin concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and in lung tissue, WBC counts in BALF, and thiobarbituric-acid-reactive materials (TBARM) in plasma, lung tissue, and BALF were examined. Increased TBARM might be associated with pulmonary injury and are produced either by the generation of lipoperoxides secondary to oxygen-free radicals or as metabolic byproducts of prostanoid metabolism. Lung tissue sections were studied by light microscopy. E. coli peritonitis, as compared with control animals, caused significant peripheral neutropenia, histopathologic evidence of lung inflammation, acidosis, and hypotension. The wet-to-dry lung ratio was increased in the peritonitis group when compared with that in the control group (p less than 0.01). Pulmonary edema in the peritonitis group was associated with significantly increased albumin concentrations in BALF and lung tissue. We report the new finding of increased TBARM concentrations in BALF after E. coli peritonitis (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). In contrast, plasma TBARM concentrations were unchanged. The levels of TBARM in the BALF correlated significantly with both lung water (p less than 0.01) and lung tissue albumin concentration (p less than 0.01). The measurement of elevated TBARM in BALF may allow acute lung injury to be detected. We conclude that this model may be useful for further studies of acute lung injury caused by E. coli peritonitis.\r"

The latter served as a sham control. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was measured serially for 10 h after each trial. Subjects developing a second wave of obstruction after recovery from the initial asthma attack were rechallenged on a third day with methacholine and followed in an identical fashion. Cold-air exercise produced an immediate 28% fall in FEV1 for the group as a whole, after which 2 distinct patterns of recovery developed. In 13 subjects, the initial obstruction resolved over several hours. Thereafter, lung function remained constant. In the remaining 7 subjects, the early attack was followed by an initial improvement and then progressive deterioration. This pattern occurred at the same times and to the same magnitude both in the hot-humid experiment in which the initial obstruction was absent, and when the obstruction was induced with methacholine. Based on these observations, it appears that the late asthmatic reaction that follows physical exertion in some subjects is a nonspecific epiphenomenon that is neither dependent upon the existence of an early response nor is unique to exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous administration of PAF-acether to the guinea pig induces bronchoconstriction, hypotension, intravascular platelet aggregation, endothelial disruption, and platelet and neutrophil diapedesis. These effects are followed within 1 h by an eosinophilic infiltration into the bronchial walls, which was also noted after the administration of antigen to passively sensitized guinea pigs. Bronchoconstriction and eosinophil infiltration are 2 major features of asthma, and selective bronchial eosinophilia characterizes late asthmatic reactions. We compared the histologic effects of PAF-acether 6 and 24 h after its intravenous injection with those of experimental passive anaphylactic shock, which is used as a model for asthma. Six hours after PAF-acether or antigen (ovalbumin) administration, a marked lung eosinophil infiltration, particularly in the bronchial walls, was noted, together with mucous plugs containing eosinophils in the bronchial lumen. Epithelial desquamation was followed after 24 h by mucous metaplasia of the bronchial epithelium. These effects were not observed when the inactive metabolite lyso-PAF was used. Our results agree fully with the suggestion that the eosinophil mediates the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma and releases materials toxic for the respiratory epithelium. Two PAF-acether antagonists (BN 52021 and WEB 2086) prevented the eosinophil infiltration triggered by PAF-acether and by antigen. When PAF-acether or ovalbumin were injected into guinea pigs after antiplatelet serum or prostacyclin, the eosinophil infiltration was significantly reduced, suggesting that platelets or another adenylate cyclase-sensitive cell are important for the subsequent PAF-acether-induced eosinophil infiltration. Our results support an essential role for PAF-acether in an experimental model of allergic asthma.\r"

After demonstrating the reproducibility of the technique, we discuss the first results of an analysis of ototoxic side effects in 75 patients (150 ears). Significant differences in the pattern of hearing loss were registered for the different platinum treatment groups (cisplatin 20 mg/m2, cisplatin 50 mg/m2, and carboplatin 350 mg/m2). In the groups receiving cisplatin 50 mg/m2 and carboplatin 350 mg/m2, 42% and 25%, respectively, of the investigated ears proved to be undamaged, versus 9% undamaged in the group receiving cisplatin 20 mg/m2 (p less than .01). Ototoxic hearing loss started mainly (46% to 70%) in the higher frequencies (10,000 to 18,000 Hz) and developed into a broader-range hearing loss (1,000 to 18,000 Hz) during treatment in 13% to 43% (p less than .01). The onset of hearing damage was influenced by the patient's age (p less than .001) and the existence of a troubled otologic history (p less than .05). The study demonstrates the important role of high frequency audiometry in early detection and monitoring of ototoxic damage.\r"

The percentage of T cells (Leu-1+ cells) was decreased during the acute stage, mainly because of a reduction of the Th cell subset (Leu-3+ cells). No significant alteration was found in the Ts cell subset (Leu-2+ cells). The T cell and Th cell subset depressions were restored to normal within 4 to 6 weeks of the onset of the palsy. The T cell changes in the peripheral blood in the acute stage of Bell's palsy indicate the involvement of cellular immune mechanisms.\r"

Tinnitus is present frequently and usually is distressing. The role of ventilation tubes (grommets) in relieving these problems was assessed in a prospective randomized controlled trial of 115 patients. In the group with grommets, there was an improvement in hearing, with a reduction of the averaged air-bone gap (p less than .01). This was not found in the control group without ventilation tubes, who developed a larger conductive loss (p less than .01) and, in addition, a slight deterioration of the averaged bone conduction threshold (p less than .01). Surprisingly, the group with grommets did not develop this sensorineural loss (p less than .01). In addition, tinnitus was improved significantly by the insertion of ventilation tubes (p less than .01). Neither necrosis nor stenosis of the external auditory meatus was found in either group.\r"

Temporal bones from drug-treated animals were examined for histopathologic and immunohistochemical changes, and sera were examined for levels of circulating antibody to type II collagen. Therapy was beneficial to the animals whether the drugs were administered alone or in combination; however, fewer lesions were observed in animals given either drug alone. Further, animals treated with steroid alone showed the least amount of inner ear damage. Immunohistochemical changes and serum levels of antibodies against type II collagen correlated with the pathologic changes. These findings suggest that both steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have potential therapeutic value in the treatment of autoimmune ear disease.\r"

Of 50 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (19 with cirrhosis, 31 without cirrhosis, including 7 with fibrolamellar variant), 37 (74%) survived for more than 3 months, and in this group evidence of tumor recurrence was obtained in 24 (64.9%), the longest survivor being 11.8 years post-transplant, and three survived for more than 5 years. Although there is no correlation between the frequency of tumor recurrence and underlying cirrhosis, or histologic type (except fibrolamellar variant), it was observed earlier in those with moderate/poorly differentiated tumors and also when prednisolone and azathioprine was used for immunosuppression. Tumor recurred in all but two of those with peripheral or central cholangiocarcinoma (one alive at 6.1 years) with median survival times of 34 weeks and 56 weeks for the central and peripheral types, respectively. Among the unusual primary tumors, one with epithelioid haemangioendothelioma developed tumor recurrence at 2 years, one of two patients with apudoma is tumor-free at 2.2 years, and the one patient with bile-duct papillary cystadenocarcinoma is alive at 1.7 years. For the secondary hepatic malignancy group, survival times were shorter with little palliation except for two patients with carcinoid syndrome who were free of associated symptoms at 6 and 10 months. Despite the overall high frequency of tumor recurrence in most categories of hepatic malignancy, liver transplantation gave worthwhile survival with a number of patients cured and in the others considerable palliation of symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Although the ability of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) to respond to orally ingested foreign antigens has been studied extensively, its function in preventing or limiting escape of resident gut bacteria has not been assessed. The following studies were performed to examine what role cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays in this process. The ability of suppression of CMI to induce escape of gut bacteria (translocation) to the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) in immunocompetent mice whose gut flora was unaltered was examined. Administration of cyclosporine or anti-L3T4 antibody failed to induce translocation of indigenous gut bacteria after 7 or 14 days of treatment. Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) also failed to induce translocation after 7 days of treatment, despite depletion of all Thy 1, Lyt 1, L3T4, and Lyt 2 positive cells from the spleen, MLN, and intestine as demonstrated by immunofluorescent microscopy. Finally, cultures of the MLN, spleen, liver, and peritoneum of T cell-deficient BALB/c nude mice and their heterozygous T cell-replete littermates were also sterile, demonstrating that congenital suppression of T CMI also does not lead to translocation of indigenous gut bacteria. The role of CMI in limiting systemic spread of bacteria that were already translocating to the MLN was also examined. Translocation of Escherichia coli C25 to the MLN was induced by gastrointestinal (GI) monoassociation, which leads to translocation of E. coli C25 to the MLN in 80-100% of mice. Treatment with ATG during monoassociation failed to induce spread of E. coli C25 to the spleen, liver, or peritoneum, despite the same degree of T cell depletion achieved with ATG in the previous experiment. Monoassociation of conventional T cell-deficient BALB/c nude and heterozygous mice and germ-free T cell-deficient BALB/c nude and heterozygous mice also did not lead to spread of E. coli C25 beyond the MLN. However, in ATG-treated, conventional nude, and germ-free nude mice, the average number of translocating E. coli C25 per MLN was consistently higher. In separate experiments the ability of stimulation of T cell function to inhibit translocation of E. coli C25 was examined. Recombinant interleukin-2, 25,000 units, was administered intraperitoneally every 8 hours during exposure to E. coli C25. This reduced the incidence of translocation of E. coli C25 from 85% to 51% (p = 0.02). Suppression of CMI, either systemically or within the GALT, has a minimal influence on the mechanisms by which the normal gut flora are translocated to the MLN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To investigate this proposition further, a review was made of all insulin-requiring diabetics undergoing curative parathyroidectomy at the Mayo Clinic between 1970 and 1984 (36 patients). All contemporary insulin-requiring diabetics undergoing thyroidectomy for benign euthyroid disease served as a control group (34 patients). One patient in each group had type I diabetes mellitus, and the remainder had type II diabetes mellitus. Preoperative insulin requirements, insulin requirements at follow-up, and change in insulin requirements did not differ significantly between the two groups. This study suggests that parathyroidectomy does not lead to a statistically significant reduction in the insulin requirements of diabetic patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and that coexistent type II diabetes mellitus should not be considered a further indication for parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

Because maintained peritoneal integrity and primary wound closure offer the best opportunity for survival, an original technique involving bilateral incisions to relax skin and rectus fascia is proposed. This technique permits medial myocutaneous advancement and primary tension-free skin closure of midline laparotomy incisions. Sixty-nine patients with severe postoperative peritonitis were treated according from 1980 through 1985. Nine of these patients died of advanced multiple organ failure soon after referral, and eight more died after prolonged treatment. Fourteen patients had one or more reoperations for complications. Only nine wound failures resulted, including five eviscerations and four wound infections followed by progressive dehiscence. The bilateral relaxing incisions healed secondarily without complication. Survivors developed midline wound hernia; ten of the 52 surviving patients have had these repaired. This method of primary closure is safe when performed in conjunction with rigorous surgical care of intraperitoneal infection and may enhance survival. We recommend the technique to surgeons who treat severe postoperative peritonitis and septic necrosis of midline laparotomy wounds.\r"

The right IMA was dissected free as a naked artery without surrounding tissue, and the left IMA was dissected with surrounding tissue using electrocautery. Both free IMA grafts were anastomosed first to the left IMA one after another and then to the left anterior descending coronary artery. The grafts were harvested 6 months later, and the prostacyclin (PGI2) production of the free IMA grafts and of the intact IMAs was measured. Radioimmunoassay was used to measure 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, the stable metabolite of PGI2. The PGI2 production of the right free IMA without surrounding tissue was 21.1 +/- 8.5 pg/mg and of the left IMA with surrounding tissue was 17.9 +/- 7.9 pg/mg (expressed in picograms of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha per milligram of tissue wet weight). The control value of the intact IMA was 18.3 +/- 6.5 pg/mg. Thus, PGI2 production of both free IMAs did not differ significantly from each other and from controls. This study showed that free IMAs were able to produce as much PGI2 as were control IMAs and that the type of dissection did not affect the result.\r"

Six of 7 deaths were related to infection (mediastinitis, 5; pneumonia and sepsis, 1), and the remaining 1 was due to failure of the transplanted heart. Respiratory tract infection occurred in each of the recipients who died with infection, and the same organisms appeared to be related to subsequent mediastinitis in 3 patients (Serratia marcescens, 2; Pseudomonas, 1) and caused fatal sepsis in another (Enterobacter aerogenes, Candida albicans). One patient died with pneumonia and sepsis prior to transplantation, and another succumbed with mediastinal infection known to be present before transplantation.\r"

Twenty-seven hypertensive patients (mean age, 63 +/- 3 years) were studied. Patients received two weeks each of daily treatment with placebo, 100 mg of atenolol, or 150 mg of metoprolol tartrate and were evaluated on the 14th day of each treatment period, after which their next treatment period began. Mental performance was measured using Trails-A maze testing. Drowsiness was measured subjectively using a visual analogue scale, and objectively using critical fusion-frequency threshold testing. Blood pressure control was equivalent and clinically adequate in all subjects. Steady-state levels of metoprolol tartrate (235.7 +/- 46 ng/mL) and atenolol (453.6 +/- 56 ng/nL) achieved were those expected to produce similar beta-blockade. Mental performance as measured by Trials-A testing showed better scores during beta-blocker treatment compared with placebo. Trails-A scores improved as patients went from placebo to metoprolol treatment, but did not change as patients went from placebo to atenolol treatment. Critical fusion-frequency threshold measurements were lower following administration of both drugs than following that of placebo, but subjectively there was no difference in feelings of lethargy between either beta-blocker and placebo. These data show greater improvement in mental testing performance to be associated with metoprolol treatment, but neither produced more lethargy than placebo in elderly patients.\r"

On entry into the clinical trial, 58% of patients taking antihypertensive medications and 44% of men not receiving antihypertensive drugs reported distress over one or more sexual symptoms. Among 304 patients treated with monotherapy who completed the trial, total symptoms distress scores of treatment groups did not differ from each other in change from baseline to week 24, but in particular, problems of maintaining an erection were significantly worsened with propranolol therapy. Among 177 patients treated with monotherapy plus a diuretic, total sexual symptoms distress scores worsened among the groups taking methyldopa or propranolol, with significant worsening in all individual symptoms among patients taking propranolol, and problems in maintaining an erection and in ejaculation among patients receiving methyldopa. Among patients treated with captopril plus a diuretic, no change from baseline appeared in scores for any of the sexual symptoms. The findings underline the importance of taking an adequate sexual history and document that selection of antihypertensive drugs may significantly affect the incidence of sexual symptoms.\r"

Rigorous control of glycemia was followed by cessation of microalbuminuria in nearly half of these patients. Microalbuminuria was associated with an increased incidence of other microvascular complications, as well as a distinctly higher plasma prorenin value in IDDM.

All six models were highly intercorrelated and proved equally effective in predicting future impairment. Procedures to establish construct validity suggested that the presence of a DSM-III diagnosis was a valid categorical definition of case, and that Axis V of DSM-III-R was a valid dimensional measure of impairment.\r"

We begin with a methodologically oriented review of the large number of previous studies that have addressed this question. Although some trends are evident, the findings are variable. Most of the studies have important methodologic limitations. We then examine the relationship between short-term outcome and four dimensions of long-term outcome in 253 DSM-III schizophrenics and psychiatric illness in their 723 first-degree relatives. No relationship is found between any dimension of outcome in schizophrenics and risk in their relatives for schizophrenia, all nonaffective psychoses, bipolar illness, or anxiety disorder. A marital outcome of divorce was strongly associated with a family history of alcoholism. Good long-term marital, residential, and occupational outcomes were positively correlated with the risk for unipolar illness in relatives. These results do not support the hypothesis that poor outcome schizophrenia is the \"genetic\" form of the disorder. However, they are compatible with the hypothesis that the liability to affective illness may influence outcome in schizophrenia.\r"

Relatives were assessed using a general personality disorder instrument, and over two thirds were interviewed by telephone; this method may have a low sensitivity to detect key features of the schizophrenia spectrum such as inadequate rapport and suspiciousness. True population differences may, however, exist in the pattern of familial aggregation for schizophrenia and related disorders. The convincing demonstration of this would be of considerable interest and should lead to a constructive search for the source of the interpopulation differences.\r"

The Health Care Financing Administration has been working with the Centers for Disease Control of the US Public Health Service to develop uniform standards for proficiency testing programs for the two regulatory programs. The current standards were developed on the premise that a combination of factors, including personnel standards, record-keeping, management requirements, quality control standards, and external quality assurance measures such as proficiency testing, could be used to make decisions on reimbursing facilities for tests or to allow a facility to test in interstate commerce. These programs were regulatory in nature and provided punitive actions for failure to comply with the standards established for participation or licensure. The provision of consultation and training was not the primary focus of the program, even if it was a desirable outcome. The private sector organizations and the regulated industry, on the other hand, viewed their programs as designed for educational and self-improvement purposes rather than for any regulatory or punitive functions. Therefore, the approaches for the regulatory agencies and the professional community have differed.\r"

A pressure threshold meter (algometer) assists in location of TPs and their relative sensitivity. A side-to-side difference exceeding 2kg in comparison with normal values indicates pathologic tenderness. The effect of treatment can be quantified. Pressure tolerance, measured over normal muscles and shin bones, expresses pain sensitivity. Myopathy is suspected if muscle tolerance drops below bone tolerance. Tissue compliance measurement documents objectively and quantitatively alteration in soft tissue consistency. Muscle spasm, tension, spasticity, taut bands, scar tissues, or fibrositic nodules can be documented. The universal clinical dynamometer is used as part of a physical examination to quantify weakness. Thermography (heat imaging) demonstrates discoid shaped hot spots over TPs. Muscle activity, spasm, or contraction is visualized as increased heat emission in the shape of the active muscle.\r"

Patients were evaluated initially, at 1, 4, and 8 weeks. The dry-eye status was evaluated by means of tear-film osmolality, tear breakup time, rose bengal staining, Schirmer's test (without anesthesia), and ocular surface-impression cytology. In general, neither preparation was found to be superior to the other. In both study groups, the mean tear-film osmolality and rose bengal staining score improved over the eight-week study, but the degree of squamous metaplasia of the bulbar conjunctival surface, as shown by impression cytology, did not change significantly.\r"

The average effect of 10-0 suture removal in 58 eyes with documented keratometry readings was a 0.30-diopter (D) decrease in astigmatism, with 59% showing 2 D or less of astigmatic change. In 83 eyes with keratometry readings before and after 11-0 suture removal, an average increase of 0.37 D of astigmatism was observed, with 81% showing less than 2 D of astigmatic change. In eyes that were highly astigmatic (greater than 6 D) before suture removal, a reduction in astigmatism exceeding 2 D was observed in 39% and 11% after 10-0 and 11-0 suture removal, respectively.\r"

The healing period until achieving best corrected visual acuity averaged 12 months for epikeratoplasty vs three months for penetrating keratoplasty. Compared with penetrating keratoplasty, epikeratoplasty offers the advantages of maintaining an intact globe surgically and postoperatively in a young, active population, while avoiding potential immune rejection. The major disadvantages are a prolonged healing period and undefined limits in the extent of the cone that would define suitable candidates preoperatively.\r"

After M-K medium was inoculated with S viridans, it was stored overnight at 4 degrees C, after which the temperature was raised to 23 degrees C. Periodic colony counts were performed for up to 24 hours after warming. No killing occurred in the cold. Ten hours passed before there was one log reduction in the bacterial colony count. Organisms could still be cultured at 24 hours. We conclude that gentamicin alone may be inadequate prophlyaxis against S viridans contamination of donor corneas.\r"

In nonstandard ACLS, intubation or drug therapy preceded defibrillation. This study retrospectively compared standard and nonstandard ACLS for ventricular fibrillation. The long-term survival rates were 12.3% (7/57) and 3.6% (6/168) for the two forms of ACLS, respectively (p = 0.03). The incidence of postcountershock asystole was 35% and 28% (p = 0.45). The survival rates for patients with a postcountershock rhythm and a pulse were 83% and 17% after standard and nonstandard ACLS (p less than 0.0001). Other factors reported to have a significant effect on survival were compared, and no significant differences (p greater than 0.05) were noted for mean age, sex, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) initiated by a bystander, ACLS response time, time to CPR, lay-witnessed arrest, or time to definitive care. The significant difference in the time to defibrillation (14 and 26 minutes) was expected. This is the first clinical study to clearly confirm the ACLS recommendation of early defibrillation before drug therapy in ventricular fibrillation.\r"

Therefore, more basic research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of local toxicity and the best therapeutic modalities to limit injury. All significant exposures should be evaluated by health care personnel familiar with the potential toxicity of this compound.\r"

  ".U": "88183624\r", 
  ".W": "Meckel's diverticulum is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Often this is related to the delay in diagnosis. Based on a US population of 200 million people and a 2% incidence, there are 4 million Meckel's diverticula present waiting to cause symptoms. Considering that most Meckel's diverticula are asymptomatic and that many authors have described the condition as a great mimic, the diagnosis is often quite elusive. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose Meckel's diverticulum correctly and expeditiously as the source of disease in the patient with an often unclear abdominal presentation. The difficulty with diagnosis should be lessened if one considers that Meckel's diverticulum presents largely in the male and younger age groups with the three major symptom complexes of bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, and inflammation. Use of 99mTc pertechnetate scintigraphy appears to be the diagnostic study of choice if Meckel's diverticulum is suspected and the patient is clinically stable. When one considers the potential for bad outcome if Meckel's diverticulum is missed in the setting of possible obstruction or hemorrhage (i.e., bowel infarction or exsanguination), a high index of suspicion and diagnostic aggressiveness is warranted. Lastly, if one thought is to be left behind, it should be: \"Meckel's is a great mimic that must be considered in all cases of intra-abdominal disease in which the cause is not readily apparent.\"\r"

This extensive test is rarely necessary in the emergency department; rather a short test of cognitive function, such as the Cognitive Capacity Screening Examination or Mini-Mental Status Examination, may be more appropriate. With frequent repetition in use and the concomitant development of clear standards for interpretation of the examination used, the emergency physician will become more comfortable with bedside mental status testing.\r"

Healing was assessed clinically at weekly intervals, and was found to parallel the normalization of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as determined by evaporimetry, and the dermal blood flow as evaluated by laser Doppler flowmetry. Results obtained with coal tar baths were not significantly different from those obtained with oil emulsion.

The clinical grading system showed that marked or moderate delayed local reactions developed in one third of patients with atopic dermatitis in response to HDM application to both mildly eczematous and clinically uninvolved skin. Relative to control sites, significant increases in area of dermatitis and degree of pruritus were also recorded in response to HDM application to mildly eczematous sites. Application of HDM solution to normal, unabraded skin of prick test positive subjects without a history of dermatitis, produced pruritus and immediate urticarial responses which were not seen at control sites, findings which demonstrate that HDM antigen may be rapidly absorbed in normal skin. Application of vehicle or antigen solution to which subjects were negative on prick testing, produced no significant local reactions. This study provides objective evidence for a role for cutaneous HDM exposure in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.\r"

Encouraged by the success of an earlier experimental trial, a prospective, controlled, randomised double masked clinical study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 1% silver sulphadiazine ophthalmic ointment in 20 eyes of mycotic keratitis. Miconazole 1% was used for comparative evaluation in another 20 eyes. Silver sulphadiazine had a higher success rate (80% vs 55%) than miconazole. It had broad antifungal activity and was found to be effective in fusarium keratitis. Absence of side effects, economy, and its efficacy in deeper and extensive lesions were additional advantages. It is concluded from this study that silver sulphadiazine is a safe and effective broad spectrum antifungal agent which can be used for the treatment of human keratomycosis.\r"

Two populations of B cells were identified by flow cytometry on the basis of antigen density. One labeled brightly with anti-Leu-16, and the other labeled at a level comparable to blood B cells. These two populations were characterized with a panel of MoAbs in two- and three-color flow cytometric studies and appeared to correspond to germinal-center and mantle-zone B cells. The pattern of staining of anti-Leu-16 on sections of frozen tonsil supported this characterization. Anti-Leu-16 labeled germinal center cells more intensely than mantle zone cells and stained a few scattered B cells in the interfollicular zone. The ability of each Leu-16+ population to secrete IgG and IgM in response to mitogens was measured in a particle immunofluorescence assay. Dim Leu-16+ B cells (small, resting B cells and a subpopulation of preactivated cells) secreted IgG and IgM in response to pokeweed mitogen (PWM) but only IgG in response to B cell growth factor (BCGF). Bright Leu-16+ B cells (small to large activated cells and possibly memory cells) did not respond to PWM but secreted IgG in response to BCGF. The functional responses of dim Leu-16+ and bright Leu-16+ B cells were consistent with their identification as mantle-zone and germinal-center B cells. Phenotypic identification and functional studies of mantle-zone and germinal-center B cells may help clarify the differentiation pathway within the germinal center.\r"

  ".W": "Two monoclonal antibodies (LN-4, LN-5) reactive to human macrophages in B5 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections have been produced by using deparaffinized cell extracts of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both monoclonal antibodies were initially identified on paraffin-embedded sections of hyperplastic lymph nodes by using the immunoperoxidase staining procedure. Specificity screens on normal human tissues show that LN-4 and LN-5 stain the cytoplasm of macrophages and histiocytes in hematopoietic organs including Kupffer's cells of the liver and Langerhans' cells of the skin. LN-4 also showed strong positivity with acini of the stomach, whereas LN-5 was positive with mantle zone B lymphocytes of the lymph node and spleen, spermatogonia, and chief cells of the stomach. Both antibodies were strongly reactive with cases of true histiocytic lymphoma but, except for infiltrating macrophages, were entirely negative in Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In all cases of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's disease, LN-4 was positive in macrophagelike cells present in the collagen bands surrounding the Hodgkin's lesions. Both monoclonal antibodies were also positive in macrophages and histiocytes present in a variety of benign lymphoid lesions including persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, Gaucher's disease, sinus histiocytosis, and dermatopathic lymphadenopathy. Because of their specificity for human macrophages, and their ability to stain B5-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, LN-4 and LN-5 are important new reagents for the diagnosis and classification of malignant and benign histiocytic lesions.\r"

We also determined the expression of the alpha 2- and alpha 3-L-fucosyltransferases necessary for their biosynthesis. The antigens that could be detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis were based on type 2 monofucosylated structures. Antibodies directed toward types 1, 3, and 4 ABH-, X- and Lewis-related antigenic determinants were always negative because the small amounts of ABH and Lewis antigens adsorbed from the serum could not be detected by these techniques. The presence of the type 2 ABH antigens on intrinsic glycoproteins was controlled by the H gene. This correlates with the presence of alpha 2-L-fucosyltransferase and the absence of alpha 3-L-fucosyltransferase on platelets. In contrast, ABH antigens were not detected by immunofluorescence on normal peripheral lymphocytes. These cells thus have only the small amounts of antigens adsorbed from the serum, these being under control of the secretor and Lewis genes. This correlates with the absence of alpha 2-L-fucosyltransferase on lymphocytes. When lymphocytes were transformed in vitro by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), however, they strongly expressed the X and sialylated X antigens, which are specific markers of normal granulocytes and monocytes, respectively. Treatment of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-O-acetate significantly decreased the expression of X and sialylated X antigens along with that of surface immunoglobulins, whereas it induced a significant expression of the H antigen under control of the H gene.\r"

Sensitization appears to be mediated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and can be prevented by prior irradiation of the Tx product with UV light, known to inactivate leukocytes, in particular, cells with accessory function. In the present study we investigated which leukocyte population was responsible for Tx-induced sensitization and subsequent marrow graft rejection. Surprisingly, neither monocytes nor macrophages or dendritic cells induced sensitization, and all dogs so treated achieved engraftment; however, all four evaluable dogs transfused with UV-exposed blood to which small numbers of normal dendritic cells (12.5 x 10(3)/kg) were added rejected their marrow graft. Among five dogs given UV-exposed blood and normal monocytes (12.5 x 10(3)/kg) only one rejected its graft, and four achieved sustained engraftment. We conclude that donor dendritic cells are necessary, albeit not sufficient for in vivo sensitization. Sensitization is prevented by elimination or inactivation of dendritic cell.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the prognostic significance of the growth fraction in diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), we studied 105 DLCL patients with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 applied to frozen tissue sections. Ki-67 detects a nuclear antigen associated with cell proliferation not found in resting cells. Ki-67 findings and other clinical prognostic factors were correlated with outcome using univariate and multivariate analyses in the proportional hazards model. High proliferative activity, defined as nuclear Ki-67 expression in greater than 60% of malignant cells (Ki-67 greater than 60), was found to be a strong predictor of poor survival among these patients (P = .003, log-rank). The 19 patients with Ki-67 greater than 60% had a median survival of 8 months compared with a median survival of 39 months for the 86 patients with Ki-67 less than or equal to 60%. Examination of pretreatment clinical variables indicated the patient groups were similar with regard to age, sex, stage, B symptoms, tumor bulk, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Both patient groups received comparable curative intent therapy and showed comparable complete response rate precluding treatment differences as modifying outcome. Multivariate analysis indicated Ki-67 is an independent predictor of survival (multivariate P = .006). Further statistical analysis using only B-cell DLCL patients treated with CHOP (63 patients) indicated that Ki-67 greater than 60 retained strong prediction of poor outcome (P = .002, log-rank) among this homogeneous group. We conclude that high proliferative activity (Ki-67 greater than 60) is an independent factor allowing laboratory prediction of probable poor outcome of DLCL.\r"

The remission, defined by platelet count superior to 100,000/microliter was studied for adults and children after 6 months and 12 months, respectively. The statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two corticotherapy regimens neither in children nor in adults. Overall, 74% of children and 41% of adults were in remission.

  ".W": "High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) added to a basic regimen of chemotherapy proved superior to cranial irradiation and sequentially administered drug pairs (RTSC) in prolonging complete remissions in children with \"standard-risk\" acute lymphocytic leukemia. To extend this result to more contemporary risk groups, we reclassified the patients according to methods of the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG), the Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCG), the Rome workshop, and St Jude Total Therapy Study XI. By life table analysis, 70% to 78% of patients with a favorable prognosis would remain in continuous complete remission (CCR) at 4 years if treated with HDMTX. Uniformly lower CCR rates could be expected with RTSC, especially in St Jude better-risk patients. HDMTX also would show greater efficacy than RTSC in the CCG average-risk and POG poor-risk groups, but the results appear inferior to those being achieved with intensified regimens for high-risk leukemia. Although both therapies would provide adequate CNS prophylaxis in favorable-risk groups, RTSC would offer greater protection in patients classified as being in a worse-risk group by St Jude criteria. We conclude that HDMTX-based therapy, as described in this report, would be most effective in patients with a presenting leukocyte count of less than 25 x 10(9)/L, of the white race, aged 2 to 10 years, and having leukemic cell hyperdiploidy without translocations.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second (18 patients) or third (two patients) complete remission after bone marrow relapse received allogeneic bone marrow transplants from histocompatible sibling donors. The preparative regimen for marrow transplantation consisted of 12 doses of 3,000 mg/m2 cytosine arabinoside twice daily for six days followed by 1,200 cGy total-body irradiation (six doses of 200 cGy twice daily for three days). The preparative regimen was well tolerated, and all patients showed marrow engraftment promptly. Twelve patients are alive in complete remission 12+ to 79+ months posttransplant; eight patients are over 48 months posttransplant. Six patients died 1 to 9 months posttransplant of nonleukemic causes: (two each of graft-v-host disease, interstitial pneumonitis, and infection). Two patients developed recurrent leukemia at 15 and 30 months posttransplant. Both have died at 19 and 36 months posttransplant. Life table analysis reveals an actuarial survival and event-free survival rate of 58% and a marrow relapse rate of 17%. These results suggest that high-dose cytosine arabinoside and fractionated total-body irradiation is a relatively nontoxic and highly effective preparative regimen for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia that deserves further evaluation.\r"

Conditioned media harvested from rIL2-stimulated (greater than 100 U/mL) peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T cells, Leu-2 cells, and Leu-3 cells all had erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA) but lacked myeloid colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or CFU-GM-inhibitory activity. These T cells were IL2 receptor-negative, and the addition of anti-IL2 receptor monoclonal antibody (anti-Tac) to T cell cultures did not abrogate this IL2-stimulated BPA production. In addition, Percoll gradient-enriched, large granular lymphocytes (LGL) were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting into Leu-11+ (NK) cells and Leu-11- (low-density Leu-4+ T) cell fractions. rIL2 stimulated LGL, Leu-11+ and Leu-11- cells to produce BPA but not detectable GM-CSF or CFU-GM-inhibitory activity. Leu-11+ (NK) cells were Tac-negative from days 0 through 14 of culture. We conclude that rIL2 at high concentrations stimulated T cells, Leu-2 and Leu-3 cell subsets, LGL, and NK cells to produce BPA but not GM-CSF and that this stimulation may be mediated by an IL2 receptor distinct from Tac or by an epitope of the IL2 receptor not recognized by the anti-Tac antibody.\r"

When conditioned medium (CM) from plastic-adherent marrow or thymus cells was also included, however, growth of mixed erythroid colonies was strongly stimulated. Both IL 3 and the accessory activity (AA) had to be present at the initiation of the cultures for growth to occur. AA was also produced by a cloned immortalized line (95/1.7) of fibroblastoid marrow cells that lacked macrophage-specific cell surface markers. Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) was also released, but not granulocyte colony-stimulating activity. When 95/1.7 CM was analyzed by gel filtration, AA eluted with an apparent size of 35 kd and separated completely from the CSF-1. Biologic assays failed to detect IL 1 or IL 3 activity in 95/1.7 CM. Growth of mixed erythroid colonies from 5-FU-treated marrow is thus stimulated by adherent marrow cell-derived factors that appear distinct not only from the known CSFs including IL 3, but also from IL 1.\r"

This close physical linkage of genes with similar structure and biologic function suggests that these cytokines may have evolved from a common ancestral gene. This linkage in evolution of two relatively divergent genes further implies that some of the other lymphokine and cytokine genes that appear to share as much or more sequence similarity than do IL 3 and GM-CSF may be distantly related members of a cytokine gene family.\r"

The action of recombinant IL 1 alpha and other hematopoietic growth factors was studied using (a) a high proliferative potential colony-forming cell assay that uses primitive hematopoietic precursors from bone marrow, and (b) a spleen colony-forming unit assay. The results indicate that the IL 1 alpha target cell population is different than the target cell populations of IL 3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; that IL 1 alpha in combination with mononuclear phagocyte colony-stimulating factor provides a proliferative stimulus; and that IL 1 alpha has at least a survival-enhancing and possibly proliferation-inducing effect on primitive hematopoietic stem cells.\r"

  ".W": "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a specific humoral growth factor that stimulates both neutrophilic granulocyte and macrophage production by bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells. GM-CSF also stimulates the proliferation and clonal growth of both tissue macrophages and blood monocytes. Although at low concentrations GM-CSF was unable to support the long-term growth of tissue macrophages, it greatly enhanced their responsiveness to macrophage CSF (M-CSF, or CSF-1). This effect was also observed by treating macrophages with GM-CSF for a short time. GM-CSF did not compete with M-CSF for binding to M-CSF receptors nor was it inactivated by treatment with anti-M-CSF antiserum. Treatment of tissue macrophages with GM-CSF led to a rapid but transient downregulation of M-CSF receptors; prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C, however, resulted in a restoration and upregulation of M-CSF receptors. Identical effects were observed with both native or recombinant GM-CSF. This study suggests that GM-CSF regulates tissue macrophage production by two modes of action: (a) direct stimulation of macrophage proliferation, and (b) enhancement of their responsiveness to M-CSF.\r"

In this review we classify the various types of PGAS and discuss their clinical features and the pathophysiologic autoimmune mechanisms that are thought to play an important role. Circulating organ- and cell-specific autoantibodies are frequently detected in patients with the syndrome and may be a marker of future organ failure. PGAS should be considered in patients with one or more of the disorders constituting the syndrome; this should facilitate early diagnosis and perhaps even prevention of other components of the disease. Early recognition and replacement therapy can be life-saving, particularly when there is adrenal or thyroid insufficiency.\r"

The characteristic patient was an obese man over the age of 55 years with hypertension, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease or peripheral vascular disease. Ultrasound examination was performed in 45 patients with these characteristics, and six aneurysms were diagnosed. Either surgery or computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis. The rate of false-negative results was estimated by review of the charts of 100 men over the age of 55 years who had undergone abdominal ultrasonography for other indications: no undetected aneurysms were discovered over 3 years of follow-up. Routine screening in this high-risk group would improve the rate of diagnosis of this potentially fatal condition before rupture and offer the patient the lower mortality rate associated with elective surgery.\r"

The main abnormality that underlies CHF is depressed myocardial function. The resulting decrease in cardiac output activates several peripheral compensatory mechanisms, which may further impair ventricular function and worsen the prognosis. Although systolic dysfunction is the traditional descriptor of CHF, diastolic dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a distinct entity. In prescribing therapy the predominant type of ventricular dysfunction and the peripheral components of the heart failure should be identified. The ultimate aim is to alleviate symptoms, minimize complications and prolong survival. Recent data from two multicentre trials have suggested that vasodilators can achieve these goals. Trials are under way to assess the impact of early vasodilator therapy on CHF.\r"

The 5-year survival rate of patients given IT was 73.3%, whereas the rate was only 36.5% in those not given IT (P less than 0.05). A study of recurrent cases revealed a significantly low incidence of peritoneal recurrence in the group on OK-432 IT (P less than 0.01). In previous work, the authors noted a favorable prognosis of patients with Stage III gastric carcinoma and with a marked infiltration of Langerhans' cells (LC) in the tumor tissues. All of the 49 in the current study were thus examined immunohistochemically, using anti-S-100 protein antibody, the objective being to clarify the relationship between OK-432 IT and the density of LC. The density of LC among those given IT was significantly increased as compared with those not given IT (P less than 0.05). The results of this study suggest that OK-432 IT may lead to augmentation of the density of LC in tumor tissues and hence prevent peritoneal recurrences in patients with Stage III gastric carcinoma.\r"

Two human RCC xenograft lines, TK-177G and TK-82, were established in nude mice and studied using MAB A6H as a targeting agent. This MAB has previously demonstrated excellent in vivo localization to RCC xenografts. Two doses of A6H (13 to 19 micrograms) labeled with iodine 131 (110 to 130 microCi) caused the tumor to regress or arrested the tumor growth in both xenografts. Similar doses (18 to 43 micrograms; 120 microCi) of 131I-labeled control MAB AFP-22 or of unlabeled A6H did not inhibit tumor growth. While most mice in the control groups had tumors greater than 250 mg in weight by day 43, none of the tumors in mice treated with 131I-labeled A6H grew to that size during the 3-month observation period. Sequential computerized scintigraphy was used to calculate the amount of radioisotope localized in tumor versus normal mouse tissue. Therapeutic doses of 131I-labeled A6H delivered a median calculated radiation dose of 38 cGy/microCi (range, 28 to 57) injected dose to RCC xenografts, and a median of 0.9 cGy/microCi to normal mouse tissues. These findings suggest that A6H is able to target radioisotopes highly specifically to RCC and achieve a therapeutic effect in the experimental setting.\r"

In this paper the in vitro effect of 17-beta-estradiol on cell proliferation in 30 primary breast tumors was studied. The effect of several estradiol concentrations was assayed, and the influence of diethylstilbestrol, tamoxifen, and nafoxidine was also tested. The response to these compounds was measured through the thymidine labeling index (TLI). When exposed to 10(-9) mol/l and 10(-8) mol/l estradiol, 14 of 19 ER-positive tumors and six of 11 ER-negative tumors were induced to further proliferate. The TLI increase over the control was 219% (P less than 0.05) at 10(-9) mol/l E2 and 258% (P less than 0.05) at 10(-8) mol/l E2 for ER-positive tumors, and 233% (0.1 less than P less than 0.2) at 10(-9) mol/l E2 and 321% (0.1 less than P less than 0.2) at 10(-8) mol/l E2 for ER-negative tumors. The addition of diethylstilbestrol and antiestrogens in vitro inhibited, to varying degrees, the estradiol-induced increase in the TLI irrespective of the ER-status. The response to E2 was correlated with the expression of the ras p21 protein and carcinoembryonic antigen. It was found that the ras p21 protein is preferentially expressed in ER-negative tumors, the opposite being true for carcinoembryonic antigen. The ras p21 protein is preferentially expressed in those ER-positive tumors that do not respond to estradiol with an increase in the TLI.\r"

The left kidney tumor was an undifferentiated neoplasm with light microscopic features suggestive of both Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma, and the right kidney tumor was identified as multilocular cystic nephroma (MLCN). In vitro tissue culture of tumor cells and hybridization experiments with an N-myc oncogene DNA probe contributed to a revised diagnosis of intrarenal neuroblastoma of the left kidney. A cell line established from the left tumor exhibited neurite outgrowth and was positive for neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin. N-myc was greater than ten-fold amplified in chromosomal DNA from the left kidney tumor. Measurement of N-myc RNA expression enabled distinction between benign and malignant tumor tissue. The detection of N-myc gene amplification predicted a poor prognosis which was confirmed by the patient's subsequent clinical course.\r"

Newer MoAb identifying B-cell (LN-1, LN-2, MB2) and T-cell-associated antigens (MT1, UCHL1) not denatured by fixation, revealed B-cell nature of tumor cells in all cases of ML. Among anti-B MoAb, LN-1 and MB2 were most consistent in their reactivity. In cryostat sections of three ML cases, the tumor cells expressed one or more B-cell-associated antigens. Plasmacytoma was negative for Dako-LC and KL1 but positive for Dako-EMA and monotypic cytoplasmic Ig.\r"

Histochemical and immunohistochemical study by the immunoperoxidase technique revealed that most of the tumors (13/21) contained mucosubstances, and that all examples of the UC were immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), keratin, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), thereby indicating the epithelial nature of the neoplastic cells. Vimentin immunoreactivity was found in nine tumors. In 19, the tumor contained various neoplastic endocrine cells, including somatostatin-immunoreactive (14/19), gastrin-immunoreactive (14/19), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)-immunoreactive (9/19), pancreatic polypeptide-immunoreactive (4/19), and serotonin-immunoreactive cells (4/19).

  ".W": "The histories of 73 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) confined to the liver who were seen at M. D. Anderson Hospital between January 1976 and December 1983 were reviewed. In 18 patients the tumor was resected either at the outset or after the patients' response to chemotherapy; nonsurgical treatments consisted of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) in 10 patients and intravenous (IV) therapy in four patients. Patients who had resection were younger, and their liver functions and performance status were better than the IV and HAI groups. Their median survival was 46 months. Of the patients who had nonresectable tumors, 28 received chemotherapy by HAI and 27 received IV therapy. Of the 28 patients in the HAI treatment group, 25 received uniform infusion of floxuridine (FUDR, Roche, Australia), doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and mitomycin C (FUDRAM). Of the 27 patients in the IV treatment group, 15 received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and doxorubicin-containing regimens; in 11 patients 5-FU was combined with other agents. The HAI and IV treatment groups were similar in age and ethnicity, performance status, serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, liver function, presence of hepatitis B antigen, and presence or absence of cirrhosis. The median survival was 9 months for HAI-treated patients and 5 months for the IV-treated group. The statistical differences were resection versus HAI, P less than 0.01; resection versus IV, P less than 0.01; HAI versus IV, P less than 0.01. Thirteen of 18 patients who had resections, six of 28 patients treated with HAI, and two of 27 IV-treated patients survived 2 years or more. It is concluded that for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma confined to the liver, the option of tumor resection either at the beginning of treatment or after chemotherapy offers the best chances for long-term survival. The overall prognosis is poor for patients with nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, but arterial infusion chemotherapy may double the median survival as compared to IV chemotherapy.\r"
