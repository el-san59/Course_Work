  ".W": "Research into the causes of alcoholism is a relatively recent scientific endeavor. One area of study which could lead to better understanding of the disease is the possibility of a genetic predisposition to alcoholism. Recent work has demonstrated that people have varying complements of enzymes to metabolize alcohol. Current knowledge is examined about the influence of various ethanol metabolizing enzymes on alcohol consumption by Asians and members of other ethnic groups. The two principal enzymes involved in ethanol oxidative metabolism are alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). ADH is responsible for the metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde. ALDH catalyzes the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate. The different isozymes account for the diversity of alcohol metabolism among individuals. An isozyme of ADH (beta 2 beta 2) is found more frequently in Asians than in whites, and an ALDH isozyme (ALDH2), although present in Asians, often is in an inactive form. The presence of an inactive form of ALDH2 is thought to be responsible for an increase in acetaldehyde levels in the body. Acetaldehyde is considered responsible for the facial flushing reaction often observed among Asians who have consumed alcohol. A dysphoric reaction to alcohol, producing uncomfortable sensations, is believed to be a response to deter further consumption. Although the presence of an inactive ALDH2 isozyme may serve as a deterrent to alcohol consumption, its presence does not fully explain the levels of alcohol consumption by those with the inactive isozyme. Other conditions, such as social pressure, and yet undetermined biological factors, may play a significant role in alcohol consumption.\r"

Through grants for special projects of regional and national significance (SPRANS), the Office of Maternal and Child Health is funding projects to break down language, culture, and access barriers to health services for pregnant women, infants, and children. Recent and current SPRANS projects have taken innovative approaches to solving the special health problems of the minority populations. They range from a breastfeeding initiative in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to an areawide genetic service program in the Virgin Islands. Examples of projects that have been conducted are presented.\r"

  ".W": "The authors used data from birth records to assess changes in health risks and health status of American Indians (AI) living in Umatilla County, OR, from 1973 to 1986. They compared the AI health risks and health status with those of other persons (non-AI) living in Umatilla County, and assessed the progress of both AI and non-AI populations toward selected 1990 national health objectives. This AI population is likely to achieve the 1990 national health objective calling for less than 5 percent of births to be low birth weight (LBW); the LBW rate decreased from 5.0 percent in 1977-80 to 4.1 percent in 1984-86. However, the population is not likely to achieve the 1990 objective calling for at least 90 percent of women to begin prenatal care during the first trimester, even though the proportion of AI women who began prenatal care in the first trimester increased from 42.3 percent in 1973-76 to 62.6 percent in 1984-86. The Yellowhawk Indian Health Center began offering clinical services to AI in Umatilla County in 1976. Compared with non-AI women, AI women closed large gaps in key health risk and health status indicators during the period from 1973 to 1986. For example, from 1973 to 1976, 14.6 percent of AI mothers compared with 6.3 percent of non-AI mothers began prenatal care in the last trimester. By 1984 to 1986, only 9.0 percent of AI and 7.9 percent of non-AI mothers began prenatal care in the last trimester. Several other desirable health indicators improved more for AI than for non-AI from 1973 to 1986.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An experimental program to prevent BBTD was implemented in 12 Native American communities. The project represented a cooperative effort by three Department of Health and Human Service agencies: Administration for Children, Youth, and Families, Head Start Bureau; Indian Health Service, Dental Program; and Centers for Disease Control, Dental Disease Prevention Activity. Intervention strategies included the training of parent volunteers, health professionals, and the tribal employees who counseled caretakers of young children and made group presentations. There was also a media campaign in each community that ran for a 3-year period. Numerous educational materials were developed including training manuals, counseling booklets, tippee cups, posters, and bumper stickers. The BBTD project's planners encouraged tailoring the education materials and strategies to fit each community. Preliminary results documented statistically significant decreases in the prevalence of BBTD at the pilot sites. This multidisciplinary, comprehensive intervention offers a model for organizing members of minority communities to prevent health problems.\r"

The Community Health Assessment and Promotion Project (CHAPP) was developed to reduce the high incidence of cardiovascular risk factors in the neighborhood's predominantly black population. Based on data from a needs assessment, a community coalition designed and directed a 10-week exercise and nutrition intervention targeted to obese residents between the ages of 18 and 59 years. The intervention consists of an orientation, attitudes assessment, selection of a specific exercise class, and twice-weekly information on nutrition and community resources. The program uses a wide range of strategies, including individual consultations, reminder telephone calls, incentives, and rewards, and free transportation and child care, to encourage participation. The exercise-nutrition intervention was provided to two separate groups. A total of 70 participants completed the intervention over a 7-month period. Program evaluation has demonstrated high participation rates and significant reductions in weight and blood pressures both immediately after the intervention and on 4-month followup. Since completion of this evaluation study, over 400 additional community members have participated in this intervention.\r"

As a result of this widening gap, nearly two-thirds of the cases reported in 1987 occurred in minority populations and, for the first time in history, the number of cases among blacks exceeded the number of cases among non-Hispanic whites. From 1985 to 1987, tuberculosis among blacks increased 6.3 percent and among Hispanics, by 12.7 percent, but it decreased 4.8 percent among non-Hispanic whites. Much of the increase appears attributable to tuberculosis occurring among persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although there are many obstacles to the elimination of the disease in minority populations, numerous strategies have been developed and are being implemented to address this situation.\r"

Indirect evidence is available also to suggest its possible endemicity among some American Indian tribes who lived within the present-day contiguous United States before the arrival of Europeans. The available data suggest that tuberculosis became a major health problem in some tribes with increased population density and cultural changes after increased contact with European civilization, paralleling the deterioration in living conditions after relocation of the tribes to reservations. By 1900, tuberculosis had become one of the most serious health problems among North American Indians. Tuberculosis control was hampered by the lack of a specific treatment, and only the advent of specific chemotherapy in an ambulatory setting brought a breakthrough. Mortality, morbidity, and risk of infection have all sharply decreased over the past three decades. However, tuberculosis incidence rates among American Indians remain well above rates in the white population. An intensified effort to identify those with tuberculosis and those at risk of tuberculosis as well as to develop compliance-enhancing strategies with treatment regimens will be necessary to eliminate tuberculosis from Indian reservations.\r"

Low ratios were found for cancer of the breast, uterus, bladder, and melanoma. In Alaska, Eskimos have the highest risk for cancer of the esophagus and liver and the lowest risk for breast and prostate cancer. Risk for multiple myeloma in Indian men in Alaska exceeds not only those of other Native groups in Alaska but that in U.S. whites as well. Despite the short period studied, increases in cancer incidence over time can be documented for lung cancer in Eskimo men and women combined, and for cervical cancer, especially in Indian women.\r"

All rates were significantly higher than the U.S. rate of 5.3 percent for the same age group. In addition, in three of the five tribal groups examined, the rates of diagnosed diabetes in Indians less than 35 years of age (range from 0.5 percent to 1.3 percent) were significantly higher than the U.S. rate of 0.4 percent for the same age group. The prevalence rates of diagnosed diabetes found in this study of American Indians in New Mexico were intermediate between those for the United States as a whole and the Pima Indians of southern Arizona. Reasons for the variations and the relative contribution of obesity, fitness, or genetic risk in the development of diabetes need further study.\r"

The predicted amino acid sequence contains a novel sequence motif related to the zinc finger, and the ABF1 protein requires zinc and unmodified cysteine residues for sequence-specific DNA binding. Interestingly, ABF1 is extensively related to its counterpart, RAP1, and both proteins share a region of similarity with SAN1, a suppressor of certain SIR4 mutations, suggesting that this region may be involved in mediating SIR function at the silent mating type loci.\r"

The presence of T cell receptor (TCR)-alpha beta + T cells in older athymic (nu/nu) mice indicates that some T cells can also mature without thymic influence. Therefore, to determine whether the thymus is required for negative selection, TCR V beta expression was compared in athymic nu/nu mice and their congenic normal littermates. T cells expressing V beta 3 proteins are specific for minor lymphocyte stimulatory (Mlsc) determinants and are deleted intrathymically due to self tolerance in Mlsc+ mouse strains. Here it is shown that V beta 3+ T cells are deleted in Mlsc+ BALB/c nu/+ mice, but not in their BALB/c nu/nu littermates. Thus, the thymus is required for clonal deletion during T cell development.\r"

We have studied the effects of elevated calcium levels using cultured keratinocytes in vitro on two of the rate-limiting steps of wound healing, chemotaxis (directed migration) and adhesion. We found that the increased calcium (10 mmol/L) significantly inhibited both keratinocyte chemotaxis and adhesion (p less than 0.05). The calcium effect on adhesion could be partially reversed by pretreatment with the calcium channel blocker verapamil. Based on these data, an animal model was formulated in which topical calcium (5 mmol/L/day) was added to linear incision wounds. This resulted in significantly (p less than 0.05) delayed wound contraction characteristic of a chronic or impaired wound. Wound contraction depends on the presence of fibroblasts that synthesize collagen. The chronic wound was characterized by increased collagenase activity (p less than 0.05) but little alteration in collagen I synthesis. The addition of verapamil to these chronic wounds resulted in improved wound closure. These studies define the molecular and cellular events occurring as a result of the addition of elevated levels of calcium both in vitro and in vivo. Calcium may play a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic wounds.\r"

A report of specific binding sites and uptake of vitamin D by the thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary indicates that vitamin D may modulate production or secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). To test this concept, we investigated the influence of elevated serum levels of vitamin D on basal and stimulated TSH. Vitamin D was administered by subcutaneously implanted sustained-release pellets at four dosages. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation tests were performed at time zero, 72 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 5 weeks. Animals administered vitamin D became significantly hypercalcemic and demonstrated elevations of vitamin D, which peaked at 72 hours and remained elevated for 2 weeks after pellet implantation. TRH-stimulated TSH levels were significantly elevated at 72 hours and at 1 week and returned to normal after 5 weeks. Parathyroid hormone levels were suppressed at 72 hours and at 1 week and displayed significant elevation at 2 weeks. These results provide in vivo evidence for an interaction and a possible regulatory role of 1,25 on pituitary TSH secretion and parathyroid function.\r"

Other Rh antigens of low and high incidence were investigated, and the presence of Rh17 and Rh44 on the RBCs was confirmed. Three persons exposed to Rh:46 cells by pregnancy or transfusion (or both) had anti-Rh46. This antibody gave positive reactions with all RBCs of common and rare Rh phenotype except Rhnull, and those of D--, D.., DCw-, and RN homozygotes.

After a state public health emergency was declared in April 1987, a statewide, cooperative federal-state-local treatment and control program was implemented. It was successful in reducing the reported incidence by 59%. Despite the success of this effort, penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae is not controlled in California, and, while not nearly the magnitude reported in Florida, an increasing number of cases are again being reported in California. We present recommendations for clinicians and local public health officials, including the epidemiologic and empiric treatment of suspected gonorrhea cases with ceftriaxone when the incidence of penicillinase-producing gonococcal cases in a community exceeds 1% of all reported gonorrhea cases.\r"

  ".W": "Although atrial natriuretic factor is primarily of atrial origin, recent observations indicate that the hormone is also synthesized by hypertrophied left ventricular myocardium. To assess the separate influences of left ventricular and left atrial dilatation and left ventricular hypertrophy on human atrial natriuretic factor levels, left atrial dimension and volume and left ventricular dimension and mass were compared in 49 normal subjects, in 33 patients with chronic aortic regurgitation, and in 15 patients with chronic mitral regurgitation. When compared with normal subjects, patients with chronic aortic and mitral regurgitation had similarly dilated and hypertrophied left ventricles (p less than 0.0005), while only mitral regurgitation patients had significantly enlarged (p less than 0.0005) mean left atrial dimension and volume. Likewise, plasma atrial natriuretic factor was elevated among patients with mitral regurgitation (60.3 +/- 47.0 fmol/ml) but was normal in patients with aortic regurgitation (19.0 +/- 11.0 fmol/ml versus 12.4 +/- 5.2 fmol/ml in normals; both p less than 0.0005 versus mitral regurgitation). Among all 97 subjects, atrial natriuretic factor levels correlated more closely with left atrial dimension and volume (r = 0.62 and 0.64, p less than 0.0005) than with left ventricular dimension (r = 0.44, p less than 0.0005) or mass (r = 0.40, p less than 0.0005). In addition, multivariate analysis indicated that left atrial volume bore a stronger independent relationship to plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels than either age or left ventricular variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To correlate PAI levels to patency of infarct arteries after thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), 125 consecutive patients with AMI were examined. Blood levels of fibrinogen, plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and PAI were measured before treatment initiation, 10 minutes after completion of rt-PA infusion and 24 and 48 hours after treatment. Coronary angiography, performed in all patients 72 hours after beginning rt-PA infusion, revealed patent infarct arteries in 97 patients and occluded infarct arteries in 28 patients. Pretreatment levels of PAI were significantly higher in patients with occluded infarct arteries (18.0 +/- 11.5 vs 10.5 +/- 9.3 IU/ml, p less than 0.01). Conceivably, higher levels of PAI may interfere with the natural thrombolytic process and make pharmacologic thrombolytic intervention less effective.\r"

Eighty-one patients were randomized to flecainide treatment or no treatment. Baseline characteristics of both groups were comparable. Compared to previous studies, patients could be classified as difficult-to-treat patients. Multiple regression analysis showed New York Heart Association class I for exercise tolerance (p = 0.0004) and flecainide treatment (p = 0.01) to be the main factors increasing the arrhythmia-free episode. However, Mantel-Cox lifetable analysis did not reveal significant differences between arrhythmia-free survival curves of both treatment groups. In the flecainide-treated group, 9% of patients experienced side effects, mostly related to negative dromotropic effects. The incidence of ventricular proarrhythmia in this group of patients was low. Thus, flecainide may be effective in postponing arrhythmia recurrence, even in difficult-to-treat patients. Caution should be excercised in treating patients with underlying conduction disturbances, sick sinus syndrome or characteristics favoring development of ventricular proarrhythmia.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens and genome has been investigated in 50 lymph nodes involved by persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL). All the patients were HIV infected and most of them (42 of 50) also had anti-EBV serum antibodies. At lymph node level, HIV and EBV antigens were studied by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies directed against viral core proteins. The HIV p24 protein was detected in 43 of 50 lymph nodes within the B-cell germinal centers with a reticular pattern. Few cells with positive results for EBV antigens were found in only 2 of 50 lymph nodes. These rare EBV-positive centrocyte-like cells were mainly located in the germinal centers. The presence of HIV and EBV genome was also studied in lymph nodes involved by PGL, with the use of in situ and Southern blot hybridization. A positive reaction for HIV genome was detected in only 1 of 14 lymph nodes with the Southern blot hybridization, and the presence of EBV genome was never demonstrated in these lymph nodes with the use of both in situ and Southern blot hybridization. The expression of EBV antigens and genome was also investigated in the peripheral blood of 15 patients with PGL in which cells with positive results for EBV antigens were detected in a single case with a frequency of 1 X 10(-4). No evidence of EBV genome was found with the use of the in situ hybridization. These results suggest that EBV is not present in lymph nodes during the PGL phase and that its possible implication in the pathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated lymphoma might be a late event.\r"

However, the present study indicates that the ZFY gene and its X homologue (ZFX) are differentially expressed in adult tissues. A human testis-specific ZFY cDNA was isolated and completely sequenced. The corresponding ZFY transcript encodes a protein that has 801 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 90.6 kD. Expression analysis demonstrated that ZFY is transcribed primarily as 3- and 5.7-kb mRNA in testis and somatic cells, respectively. In contrast, the ZFX gene is expressed as a 5-kb transcript in the testis and as 6.7- and 8-kb transcripts in both ovarian and somatic tissues. With sets of gene-specific oligonucleotides, the origin and relative amount of the respective transcripts can be demonstrated in both Northern hybridization and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Significantly, the 3-kb ZFY transcript was also detected in other mammalian adult testes. The testis-specific transcription of the ZFY gene hence suggests that it serves a conserved function in this organ.\r"

  ".W": "Introduction of the fluoroquinolones has altered physician prescribing practices in the treatment of infectious diseases for both inpatients and outpatients. To evaluate the impact of unrestricted prescribing of these agents, the antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates to ciprofloxacin and other commonly used antibiotics was prospectively studied in a 300-bed community teaching hospital. Only 0.6 percent (nine of 1,454 isolates) of fresh clinical isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (minimal inhibitory concentration value greater than 2 micrograms/ml) in an initial study conducted between 1984 and 1985. A similar pattern was observed in the second half of 1987 (0.5 percent, or five of 940 isolates), just prior to the release of ciprofloxacin. Throughout 1988, however, as quinolone usage rose, the incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance rose, reaching a peak of 4.0 percent in the last quarter of 1988. Of 63 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates in 1988, 22 were Pseudomonas and 28 were staphylococci, representing resistance rates of 6.5 and 4.2 percent, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae remained exquisitely susceptible with only five of 1,720 isolates (0.3 percent) resistant to ciprofloxacin. Seventy-two percent of ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were recovered from patients who had received a fluoroquinolone within the previous month. If these isolates are subtracted from the total number of resistant micro-organisms recovered, baseline fluoroquinolone resistance did not change significantly from 1984 to 1988. Soft-tissue infections (50 percent) represented the greatest source of ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms, including osteomyelitis, but urinary tract infections (26 percent), all associated with instrumentation, were also a significant source. Although the fluoroquinolones are extremely valuable antimicrobial agents, the emergence of drug resistance may be promoted when these drugs are used for treatment of chronic infections or when poorly drained abscesses, necrotic tissue, or indwelling foreign bodies are present.\r"

This isolate also showed impaired uptake of ciprofloxacin. Respiratory isolates from cystic fibrosis patients did not show loss of outer membrane protein. MICs were lowered by ethylene diaminetetra-acetic acid, suggesting changes in lipopolysaccharide.

  ".W": "The fetal lung is an important site of fluid production and is postulated to serve a regulatory role in fetal fluid balance. To assess the role of atrial natriuretic factor on fetal lung liquid production, we studied the effect of intravenous atrial natriuretic factor infusion on tracheal fluid production in fetal sheep with chronic vascular and tracheal catheters. Ovine fetuses (mean gestation = 130 days +/- 1 day) received successive 40-minute intravenous infusions of increasing doses of synthetic fragment 1-28 atrial natriuretic factor (5, 25, and 100 ng/min.kg-1). In response to the 25 ng/min.kg-1 infusion, fetal tracheal fluid production decreased from 1.2 +/- 0.3 ml/10 min to 0.6 +/- 0.2 ml/10 min (p less than 0.05), and remained suppressed during the 100 ng/min.kg-1 infusion (0.5 +/- 0.2 ml/10 min). There was a significant inverse correlation between tracheal fluid production and fetal plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels (r = -0.61, p less than 0.001). Basal tracheal fluid sodium and potassium concentrations (147 +/- 1 mEq/L and 5 +/- 1 mEq/L) and osmolality (291 +/- 3 mOsm) did not change during the atrial natriuretic factor infusion periods. The observation that atrial natriuretic factor acts to decrease fetal lung fluid production suggests that atrial natriuretic factor may be important in the fetal adaptive response to extrauterine life.\r"

The provision of optimal support can be expected to obviate the stress-related response associated with increased gut permeability and bacterial translocation. Enteral feeding is the preferable technique whenever it is possible. It should be used to provide whatever level of nutrients the gut will accommodate, even when it may not immediately support full feeding. Parenteral administration of gut-specific nutrients may be an option in the near future. Judicious consideration of the effects of antibiotics and other drugs on indigenous flora is also important.\r"

  ".U": "90072580\r", 
  ".W": "We reviewed our experience with 32 patients who underwent massive intestinal resection to determine when intestinal continuity should be maintained. An enterostomy was created in 21 patients (66 percent) at the initial resection because of questionable bowel viability and an unstable condition or the need for colonic anastomosis. Intestinal continuity was restored in only 20 percent of these patients. In 11 patients (34 percent), intestinal continuity was maintained at the time of resection. Only four of these patients (36 percent) had a satisfactory long-term outcome. Overall, intestinal continuity was maintained in 10 of the 22 patients (45 percent) followed over the long-term. Three quarters of patients with intestinal remnants shorter than 3 feet had an enterostomy. We believe intestinal continuity should be restored at the time of massive resection only in carefully selected patients when bowel viability is ensured, remnant length is greater than 3 feet, and a colonic anastomosis is not required. Maintaining intestinal continuity eliminates the inconvenience of the stoma but may cause dietary restriction and perianal discomfort.\r"

Between 1970 and 1988, 47 children 17 years of age or less underwent cholecystectomy for cholecystitis or cholelithiasis in our hospital. The patients were divided into chronologic groups: Group 1 encompassed 1970 through 1979 (15 patients) and group 2, 1980 through 1988 (32 patients). The groups were compared for age, sex, pregnancy, blood dyscrasia, family history, obesity, use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and incidence of choledocholithiasis with its sequelae. A significant increase in the number of patients with cholelithiasis was found. Infants and young children were affected more frequently in group 2, and many of these young patients had a history of TPN. Choledocholithiasis was also more common in group 2 and presented with life-threatening sequelae. Calculous biliary tract disease should be considered as a possible cause of abdominal pain in children. Timely operative intervention can prevent the increasingly common sequelae of childhood cholelithiasis.\r"

We examined in healthy volunteers the effects of changing isocalorically from intravenous dextrose 440 kcal/day to amino acids, on one occasion 23% branched-chain and on another 85%. The change to the 23% regimen produced a significant increase in metabolic clearance of antipyrine, a model for oxidation (mean +/- SE 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 3.7 +/- 0.4 L/h, N = 6, P less than 0.003), but the change to the 85% regimen did not, indicating that the composition of an amino acid infusion can influence its effect on oxidative metabolism. Analysis of the concentration-time curve for antipyrine after simultaneous dosing and start of the 23% regimen suggests that the increase in metabolic capacity occurred within a few hours. Metabolic clearance of acetaminophen, a model for conjugation, was not altered by changing to either amino acid regimen.\r"

Experiments in awake dogs were designed to mimic the clinical situation of an accidental intravenous (IV) injection of local anesthetics. On the first experimental day, lidocaine (8 mg.kg-1.min-1), bupivacaine (2 mg.kg-1.min-1), and ropivacaine (2 mg.kg-1.min-1) were infused intravenously until seizures occurred (n = 6 for each group). The average dose and arterial plasma concentration at seizure onset was 20.8 +/- 4.0 mg/kg and 47.2 +/- 5.4 micrograms/mL for lidocaine, 4.31 +/- 0.36 mg/kg and 18.0 +/- 2.7 micrograms/mL for bupivacaine, and 4.88 +/- 0.47 mg/kg and 11.4 +/- 0.9 micrograms/mL for ropivacaine. The margin of safety between the convulsive and lethal doses was determined by administering two times the convulsive dose 24 h later. Two dogs given lidocaine died because of progressive hypotension, respiratory arrest, and finally cardiovascular collapse with an average peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 469 micrograms/mL. No ventricular arrhythmias were observed in this group. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in five of six dogs receiving bupivacaine. Four animals died because of hypotension, respiratory arrest, and cardiovascular collapse. One additional animal died because of ventricular fibrillation. The Cmax for bupivacaine was 70.1 +/- 14.6 micrograms/mL in nonsurvivors. In the ropivacaine group one animal died because of hypotension, respiratory arrest, and cardiovascular collapse (Cmax = 72.4 micrograms/mL). A surviving dog had transient premature ventricular contractions. Twenty-four hours later three times the convulsive dose was administered to the survivors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this prospective study was to document postoperative myocardial infarction (PMI) by technetium pyrophosphate scan using single-photon emission computed tomography (TcPPi-SPECT) in 28 patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting (CABG). The relationships of intraoperative electrocardiographic myocardial ischemia, hemodynamic responses, and pharmacological requirements to this incidence of PMI were correlated. Radionuclide cardioangiography and TcPPi-SPECT were performed 24 h preoperatively and 48 h postoperatively. A standard high-dose fentanyl anesthetic protocol was used. Twenty-five percent of elective CABG patients were complicated with PMI, as documented by TcPPi-SPECT with an infarcted mass of 38.0 +/- 5.5 g. No significant difference in demographic, preoperative right and left ventricular function, number of coronary vessels grafted, or aortic cross-clamp time was observed between the PMI and non-PMI groups. The distribution of patients using preoperative beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or calcium channel blocking drugs was found to have no correlation with the outcome of PMI. As well, no significant differences in hemodynamic changes or pharmacological requirements were observed in the PMI and non-PMI groups during prebypass or postbypass periods, indicating careful intraoperative control of hemodynamic indices did not prevent the outcome of PMI in these patients. However, the incidence of prebypass ischemia was 39.3% and significantly correlated with the outcome of positive TcPPi-SPECT, denoting a 3.9-fold increased risk of developing PMI. Prebypass ischemic changes in leads II and V5 were shown to correlate with increased CPK-MB release (P less than 0.05) and tends to occur more frequently with lateral myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cerebral blood flow was measured using the iv method of 133-Xe CBF determination and AVDO2 was measured using systemic arterial-jugular venous oxygen content differences. Patients, age 68 +/- 1 yr (mean +/- SE), received either isoflurane (n = 10), 0.75% in O2 and N2O, 1:1; or sufentanil (n = 10), 1.5-2 micrograms/kg bolus and then 0.2-0.3 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 infusion in addition to O2 and N2O, 2:3. Measurements were made immediately before carotid occlusion, and then at two levels of PaCO2 (approximately 32 and 42 mmHg) after insertion of a temporary in-dwelling bypass shunt. Prior to carotid occlusion, there was no significant difference in CBF (ml.100 g-1.min-1) between patients receiving isoflurane (22 +/- 3) or sufentanil (20 +/- 2). Similarly, there was no difference in AVDO2 (vol-%) between isoflurane (4.5 +/- 0.7) and sufentanil (5.4 +/- 0.8) groups. Using a two-way ANOVA design with anesthetic as the between-group factor and elevation of PaCO2 as the within-group repeated measure, there was a significant effect of hypercarbia to increase CBF (P less than 0.0001) and decrease AVDO2 (P less than 0.001). The product of AVDO2 and CBF, which reflects cerebral metabolic oxygen consumption, remained constant (P = 0.364).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

If two of these systems are held relatively constant, changes in CO2 excretion will reflect the third. CO2 measurement has been advocated as a method of ensuring endotracheal intubation. Because the air in the esophagus has very low levels of CO2, the use of capnometers may help prevent unrecognized esophageal intubation in prehospital and emergency department settings. In patients with normal perfusion and ventilation, end-tidal CO2 measurements closely reflect alveolar PCO2. Capnometry may decrease the need for frequent arterial blood gas measurements. A sudden change in end-tidal CO2 measurement may indicate decreased lung perfusion and an early shock state. Thus, capnometry may be useful to monitor critical patients in the ED. In addition, capnometry has potential usefulness as a noninvasive indicator of the efficacy of ongoing CPR efforts. End-tidal CO2 has been shown to correlate with cardiac output, perfusion pressures, and successful resuscitation in experimental models of cardiac arrest. Further clinical studies are needed to define the role of capnometry in emergency medicine.\r"

Infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) during field transport has been proven safe, but optimal methods for reliably diagnosing acute myocardial infarction in the prehospital setting have yet to be delineated. A major advance would be achieved if thrombolysis were proven effective in preventing the progression of unstable angina to actual infarction. However, early studies have yielded contradictory results. The use of tPA in dissolving peripheral arterial clots appears very promising, but long-term limb survival has yet to be demonstrated. Unlike heparin, thrombolytic agents can also lyse clot in peripheral deep veins and possibly lessen the tendency toward postphlebitic syndrome. The proper dosage regimen to minimize hemorrhage has not been determined. Pulmonary emboli can be lysed by tPA. IV infusion is as effective as intrapulmonary. Significant complications can be minimized, particularly if major vessel catheterization can be avoided for diagnosis. Even after catheterization for pulmonary angiography, however, thrombolytic therapy appears quite promising. The use of thrombolytic agents for embolic-thrombotic stroke is less promising: therefore, the risk of hemorrhagic complication may not outweigh the potential benefit. Thrombolytic therapy thus offers the potential for significant impact on the practice of emergency medicine.\r"

All three drugs produced PAEs of 1.1 to 3.8 h in vitro and 1.4 to 4.3 h in vivo against the pathogens tested. In vitro and in vivo results correlated well. The PAE had a significantly (P less than 0.01 to 0.001) longer duration in vivo than in vitro, but the PAE of imipenem on Staphylococcus aureus was longer in vitro. The PAE was not due to residual antibiotics at the site of infection, and no PAE was obtained if at any time the antibiotic concentration at the infection site reached the MIC for the pathogen tested. The results indicate that the presence of a PAE may enable antibiotics to be given more intermittently without a loss of efficacy and that the PAE can only be induced if the level of the antibiotic exceeds the MIC for the pathogen in question for at least several minutes.\r"

  ".W": "Difloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with in vitro activity against both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis and a long (26-h) half-life. A single oral dose of 200 mg of difloxacin was used to treat 30 men with uncomplicated urethral gonorrhea in an open trial. Of the isolates of N. gonorrhoeae, three produced penicillinase and two were resistant to tetracycline. N. gonorrhoeae was eradicated from all 29 evaluable patients. The geometric mean MIC of difloxacin for 30 pretreatment N. gonorrhoeae isolates was 0.014 (range, less than or equal to 0.0039 to 0.03) microgram/ml. Four (13.3%) of the 30 subjects with gonococcal urethritis also had C. trachomatis recovered from their pretreatment cultures. Treatment with difloxacin was associated with the eradication of C. trachomatis from all four men. In addition, C. trachomatis was isolated from the posttreatment culture of only one man who had a negative culture before treatment. Nineteen patients (65.5%) reported adverse experiences, and 17 of them (58.6%) developed symptoms suggestive of central nervous system dysfunction. An oral dose of 200 mg of difloxacin is effective treatment for uncomplicated urethral gonorrhea and may also eliminate a coexisting infection with C. trachomatis. Side effects may limit the utility of this agent.\r"

  ".W": "Lipopolysaccharides were extracted from freeze-dried cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (polymyxin B susceptible), isolate A (polymyxin B resistant), and isolate A-reverted (polymyxin B intermediate resistance) by either the phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether or the modified phenol-water method. Isolate A and isolate A-reverted had drastic losses of 2-hydroxydodecanoic acid and significant decreases in 3-hydroxydecanoic acid. Concentrations of amide-linked 3-hydroxydecanoic acid were similar in all three strains. Minor alterations were noted in the composition of 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid, heptose, phosphate, neutral sugars, and amino compounds. The concentrations of rhamnose in isolate A and of rhamnose and glucose in isolate A-reverted were significantly different from those in PAO1. Trace amounts of mannose and other minor unidentified carbohydrates were detected in all strains. Polymyxin B included in isolate. A growth medium complexed with lipopolysaccharides and remained bound throughout purification. PAO1 lipopolysaccharides bound more polymyxin B than did isolate A lipopolysaccharides. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated minor differences in smooth- and rough-form lipopolysaccharides of the different strains. We propose that loss of hydroxy fatty acids from lipopolysaccharides perturbs outer membrane hydrophobicity and is a contributing factor to polymyxin B adaptive resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Many gram-negative bacteria are known to be remarkably resistant to hydrophobic noxious agents by virtue of their outer membranes (OM). We investigated, by using four different assay methods, the ability of sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP) to disrupt this OM barrier. (i) In the growth inhibition assay, HMP was found to sensitize strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to all the hydrophobic probes tested (rifampin, fusidic acid, dactinomycin, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and Triton X-100). A concentration of 0.3% HMP decreased the MICs of the probes by a factor of approximately 10, and maximally even a 30-fold sensitization was found with 1% HMP. (ii) In the bactericidal assay, 0.3% HMP decreased the MBC of the hydrophobic probe rifampin by a factor of approximately 30. (iii) In the bacteriolytic assay, 0.1% HMP sensitized the target bacteria to lysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100. (iv) In the fluorescent-probe binding assay, HMP drastically enhanced the binding of fluorescent N-phenyl naphthylamine to the membranes of the target cells. In addition to P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. fragi, and Escherichia coli were susceptible to the OM permeability-increasing action of HMP, while P. cepacia was resistant.\r"

  ".W": "Three sulfonamides and four dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors were tested alone and in combination to determine their in vitro effects on two strains of Toxoplasma gondii grown in MRC5 fibroblast tissue culture. Toxoplasma growth was quantitated by an enzyme immunoassay performed directly on the fixed cultures, and linear regression models were used to quantify the relationship between the optical density values generated by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the concentrations of the antimicrobial agents in the culture medium. The cytopathic effects of antimicrobial agents on T. gondii were examined in Giemsa-stained cultures. Sulfonamides and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors exhibited similar patterns of inhibition, consisting of an important increase of the inhibitory effect within a narrow range of concentrations. Sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfisoxazole were all found to have important inhibitory effects on T. gondii; the 50% inhibitory concentrations estimated from the regression models were 2.5 micrograms/ml for sulfadiazine, 1.1 micrograms/ml for sulfamethoxazole, and 6.4 micrograms/ml for sulfisoxazole. This inhibition of growth was associated with a reduction of the number of parasitized cells and intracellular parasites that were morphologically normal. With dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, including pyrimethamine, trimethoprim, trimetrexate-glycuronate, and piritrexim, a strong inhibition of Toxoplasma growth was observed, which was associated with striking morphological changes of the parasites. The 50% inhibitory concentrations were 0.04 microgram/ml for pyrimethamine, 2.3 micrograms/ml for trimethoprim, 0.16 ng/ml for trimetrexate-glycuronate, and 6.9 ng/ml for piritrexim. When sulfonamides and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors were used in combination, a synergistic effect was observed with sulfadiazine combined with pyrimethamine, trimetrexate-glycuronate, and piritrexim; sulfisoxazole combined with pyrimethamine; and trimethoprim combined with sulfamethoxazole. These results were analyzed in comparison with human pharmacokinetics data.\r"

  ".U": "90072988\r", 
  ".W": "Men and women with suspected or proven genital infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis were enrolled in a double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of fleroxacin. Patients received either 400, 600, or 800 mg once daily for 7 days and were monitored approximately 2, 4, and 7 weeks after initiation of therapy. In men monitored for at least 6 weeks or until failure of the therapy, fleroxacin failed to eradicate C. trachomatis in three of eight on the 400-mg regimen, in one of four on the 600-mg regimen, and in four of seven on the 800-mg regimen. All five women monitored for at least 6 weeks became culture negative. There was no association between in vitro susceptibility of C. trachomatis to fleroxacin and outcome, with MICs being 4 to 8 migrograms/ml for almost all isolates tested. Among those with positive cultures for Ureaplasma urealyticum initially, the first follow-up cultures remained positive in 8 (29%) of 28 men and 8 (50%) of 16 women. Independent of culture results, men with nongonococcal urethritis receiving 800 mg of fleroxacin were significantly more likely to show a clinical response than men receiving 400 or 600 mg (93 versus 54%). Adverse events were frequent, often severe, and dose related. Insomnia and photosensitivity reactions were the most important. The adverse reactions and unacceptably high rates of microbiologic failure resulted in premature termination of the study.\r"

In a double-blind evaluation of oral fleroxacin, using 400, 600, or 800 mg once daily for 7 days in an ambulatory setting for treatment of uncomplicated genital infections, we encountered unexpectedly high rates of adverse reactions. The objective of this analysis was to determine whether any factors in addition to dose could be found to account for our observations. Adverse reactions developed in 66 (84%) of 79 individuals, and severe reactions arose in 38 (48%). Most frequent were central nervous system reactions (70%), with insomnia being especially frequent (49%); gastrointestinal reactions (39%) and photosensitivity reactions (10%) were also common. Development of any reaction (central nervous system reactions, insomnia, and severe intestinal reactions) was dose related. Development of photosensitivity reactions correlated with an outdoor occupation. No other factors, including usual daily caffeine use, correlated with the development of adverse reactions. In our study, fleroxacin taken as a single daily 600- or 800-mg dose was associated with an unacceptably high rate of adverse reactions. Other studies are required to determine whether this problem is unique to fleroxacin or will occur with higher doses of other fluoroquinolones possessing similar chemical modifications and/or good tissue penetration and very long half-lives.\r"

Thirty-five clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Corynebacterium sp. group JK, and Enterococcus faecalis, were tested in vitro for the measure of the serum bactericidal titers and killing rates. The mean peak concentrations of daptomycin in serum 1 h after the administration of 1 and 2 mg/kg were 11 and 20 micrograms/ml, respectively. At 24 h after the administration of 2 mg/kg, the mean level in serum was 1.9 micrograms/ml, which is higher than the MICs for susceptible pathogens. Daptomycin and amikacin provided identical concentrations in serum whether given alone or in combination. Among the six regimens tested, those including daptomycin provided the highest and the most prolonged serum bactericidal titers against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis. The killing rates measured by the killing curves were correlated with the concentration/MIC and concentration/MBC ratios of daptomycin for all strains tested. Significant killing occurred once the concentration of daptomycin in the serum 4- to 6-fold the MIC or 1- to 1.2-fold the MBC. The combination of daptomycin and amikacin had no effect on either the serum bactericidal titers or the rates of killing. Only vancomycin provided significant killing of the strains of Corynebacterium sp. group JK.\r"

In many neonatal units, however, concern that ventilation may increase gastro-oesophageal reflux (and therefore aspiration) leads to avoidance of enteral feeding during ventilation. We have therefore performed a crossover study of gastrooesophageal reflux by monitoring lower oesophageal pH in a group of nine enterally fed, very low birthweight infants both during assisted ventilation and normal breathing. All infants had less reflux during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (mean (SEM) reflux index 2.3 (0.6%)) than during normal breathing (mean (SEM) reflux index 6.1 (1.1%)). Assisted ventilation was associated with a significant reduction in the gastro-oesophageal pressure gradient, an effect which may be related to the use of positive and end expiratory pressure during ventilation. These data show that fear of gastro-oesophageal reflux should not preclude the use of enteral feeding in preterm infants receiving ventilation.\r"

This study tests whether mannitol, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, modifies these events. Patients received mannitol 0.2 g/kg (n = 14) or saline (n = 12) intravenously before infrarenal aortic clamping. With saline, 30 minutes after clamping, plasma TxB2 levels rose from 124 to 290 pg/mL (p less than 0.01), and MPAP rose from 19 to 27 mmHg (p less than 0.01). Aortic clamp release led to further increases in plasma TxB2 to 378 pg/mL (p less than 0.01) and MPAP to 34 mmHg (p less than 0.01). The white blood count (WBC) fell from 9800 to 4400/mm3 (p less than 0.01). Four to eight hours after surgery, physiologic shunting (Q[sc]S[xsc]/Q[sc]T[xsc]) rose from 9% to 20% (p less than 0.01) and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) increased from 22 to 32 cmH2O (p less than 0.01). Chest radiography demonstrated pulmonary edema while the pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 mmHg, excluding left ventricular failure. By 24 hours pulmonary edema resolved and the PIP and PaO2 returned to baseline. Mannitol treatment relative to saline, during and after aortic clamping reduced plasma TxB2 levels to 155 and 198 pg/mL, respectively (p less than 0.01); MPAP to 21 and 26 mmHg (p less than 0.01); minimized the decline in WBC to 5850/mm3 (p less than 0.01), and the postoperative rise in Q[sc]S[xsc]/Q[sc]T[xsc] to 12%, and PIP to 28 cmH2O (both p less than 0.01). Chest radiography showed no pulmonary edema. Finally in vitro studies documented that mannitol 1 to 10(-4)M, but not dextrose, in a dose-dependent manner inhibited Tx synthesis by ADP-activated platelets. These data indicate that mannitol maintains pulmonary function after AAA by limiting ischemia-induced thromboxane synthesis.\r"

Eight of 14 monoclonal antibodies worked well on the routinely processed sections. Antidesmin (D33) (Dako Corp, Santa Barbara, Calif) and anti-muscle actin (HHF35) showed specific immunostaining in all 4 rhabdomyosarcomas included in this study. Anti-epithelial membrane antigen immunoreactivity was positive in all small-cell carcinomas of the lung. Anti-leukocyte common antigen (Dako) showed positive immunostaining in lymphomas and did not immunoreact with nonhematopoietic tumors. However, it was important to be aware that some lymphomas may not have been labeled with anti-leukocyte common antigen. All 6 neuroblastomas showed a positive immunoreactivity with anti-chromogranin A (LK2H10) and a weak reaction with antisynaptophysin (SY38). Panels of commercially available monoclonal antibodies, including anti-leukocyte common antigen, anti-epithelial membrane antigen, antidesmin (Dako), anti-muscle actin, and anti-chromogranin A, appear to be most useful in the differential diagnosis and staging of small round cell tumors on routinely processed biopsy specimens.\r"

Thirty-six female Fischer rats were randomized into three groups: group 1 (chow) was fed rat chow and water ad libitum, group 2 (total parenteral nutrition) received a standard hyperalimentation formula, and group 3 (total parenteral nutrition-glutamine) received a hyperalimentation solution that contained 2% glutamine. Animals were maintained on their respective diets for 2 weeks and then killed. Mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested for culture, bile was assayed for secretory IgA, and bowel was excised to assay bacterial adherence. Results indicated that glutamine-supplemented total parenteral nutrition protects against bacterial translocation from the gut seen with standard formulas. This effect may be mediated by the secretory IgA immune system.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies demonstrated that intraperitoneal fibrinolysis using tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) prevented intraabdominal abscess formation in a rat fibrin clot infection model when administered simultaneously with the infecting inoculum. To more closely mimic the clinical setting, the efficacy of delayed administration of t-PA on intra-abdominal abscess formation was examined. A delay of 2, 6, and 18 hours had no effect on the rate of abscess formation but did reduce abscess size, indicating partial fibrinolysis. Since fibrin clots dehydrate in vivo, we hypothesized that a higher concentration of t-PA might be necessary to effect complete abscess resolution. High-dose t-PA (0.1 mg/mL) prevented abscess formation following a 6-hour delay and reduced mean weight following an 18-hour delay. Since heparin sodium may prevent new fibrin deposition and enhance t-PA activity, it was combined with t-PA to investigate potential synergistic effects. Despite adequate anticoagulation with heparin, no synergy with t-PA could be documented. In addition, the combination of antibiotics with t-PA did not affect its efficacy in vivo. We demonstrate that delayed administration of t-PA is effective in preventing abscess formation and may have implications for the clinical setting where initial surgical intervention is usually delayed.\r"

  ".W": "Major mechanical trauma causes a severe suppression of B-cell differentiation and IgM synthesis in mononuclear leukocyte cultures. In this study the effect of recombinant lymphokines and physiologic T-cell supernatants on B-cell differentiation was investigated. The influence of potentially suppressing monocytes and positive regulatory T-lymphocytes was eliminated using purified B-cell cultures. Antigen-induced IgM synthesis was reduced on all days following trauma. Addition of recombinant interleukin 2 or T-cell supernatant enhanced but did not restore IgM synthesis. Although recombinant interleukin 4 and recombinant interferon gamma had a suppressive effect on IgM synthesis in controls, both lymphokines were ineffective in the patients' IgM synthesis. Spontaneous IgG production in patients was dramatically elevated, and the addition of lymphokines did not show any enhancing effect in patients. These results demonstrate that the IgM/IgG shift observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures also exists in purified B-cell cultures. Interleukin 2 partially restored suppressed IgM synthesis, while interleukin 4 and interferon gamma were ineffective in patients' B-cell differentiation. Interleukin 2 was the most effective lymphokine for the induction of Ig synthesis. These results lead us to conclude that the altered B-cell metabolism might also be responsible for the suppression of humoral immunity following trauma.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that selegiline (L-deprenyl), a selective inhibitor of B-type monoamine oxidase, can halt the natural progression of Parkinson's disease, its use in 22 naive patients (mean age, 58 years; mean Parkinson's disease duration, 2.3 years) in the early stages (1 to 2) of the disease was studied. Patients were started and maintained on a daily dose of 10 mg of selegiline, and they underwent neurologic examinations at 3-month intervals using our center's disease staging and total rated disability scores. The criterion set for disease progression was defined as either the appearance of a new objective sign and/or a definite, persistent worsening (greater than 25%) of existing signs after the initiation of the selegiline trial. Patients remained on a regimen of selegiline [corrected] for periods ranging from 7 to 84 months. At the time of their latest neurologic examination, 17 (77%) of the 22 patients had conditions that demonstrably worsened with selegiline alone at an average of 10.8 months from the start of the drug therapy. Six of these 17 patients with worsening conditions (or 27% of the original 22) eventually required the addition of levodopa with carbidopa (Sinemet) on average at 13 months from the start of selegiline therapy; they have continued, to date, taking this combination for an additional mean follow-up period of 20.7 months. Four of the original 22 patients had relatively unchanged, stable neurologic status at the time of their latest examination (average follow-up period, 11.6 months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred patients at a median age of 63 years, receiving conventional levodopa therapy for 8 years, who had had Parkinson's disease for 10 years, tried a regimen of selegiline (L-deprenyl), a type B monoamine oxidase inhibitor, at a daily dose of 10 mg, for varying periods from less than 6 months to more than 24 months (28% over 24 months). Selegiline does improve parkinsonism during the initial 6 months to 12 to 24 months of combined therapy in one third to almost half of patients with an end-of-dose type of response to long-term levodopa therapy. However, even this particular class of patients is unable to maintain such an improvement by 36 months, much less by 48 months, from the start of the selegiline trial. About one quarter of poor responders to levodopa and those with random deterioration show improvement in their parkinsonian status in the first 6 months of the selegiline trial, but their conditions quickly deteriorate by 1 year. The predominant pattern of response to previous levodopa therapy and the severity of the total disability score at the initiation of the selegiline trial were the two variables that were predictive of risk of failure with the drug. No evidence suggested that selegiline decreases the excess mortality rate of Parkinson's disease above that achieved with the use of levodopa alone. Selegiline as an adjunctive agent to conventional levodopa therapy was not unduly impressive with regard to preventing progression of Parkinson's disease.\r"

A single dose of the lipoxygenase blocker phenidone was injected intraperitoneally to 2K,1C rats during the early phase (14 days) of the development of hypertension (mean intraarterial blood pressure 137 +/- 3.9 mm Hg). Phenidone (60 mg/kg) markedly decreased arterial pressure to nadir levels of 58.9% of resting blood pressure. The maximal changes were observed 15 min after injection and the hypotensive response was sustained for at least 2 h. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) increased from 74.3 +/- 18.9 to 281.0 +/- 6.5 ng/mL/h after injection (P less than .05). Thus, the hypotensive effect of phenidone was not due to suppression of renin secretion but presumably due to inhibition of its effects. It is suggested that arachidonate metabolites of the LO pathway at the vascular bed may be involved in maintenance of high arterial pressure in 2K,1C renovascular hypertension in rat.\r"

Each dose was preceded by placebo (saline infusion for 45 min) with a 48 h interval between each study. Iloprost significantly (P less than .05) reduced blood pressure, and increased heart rate, filtered sodium, urinary sodium excretion, fractional sodium excretion, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and plasma renin activity (PRA). The blood pressure lowering effect as well as the heart rate, renal plasma flow and noradrenaline increases were significantly greater on the 4 ng dose. Glomerular filtration rate and adrenaline showed a dose-dependent increase; urinary sodium excretion and fractional sodium excretion were similarly increased by the three doses. No correlation was found between urinary sodium excretion and either glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow. The data obtained indicate that Iloprost causes reduction of blood pressure with a reflex activation in the sympathetic nervous system and stimulation of renin secretion, renal vasodilation mainly at the level of the afferent arteriole, and natriuresis. This latter effect is probably due to a direct inhibition of tubular reabsorption, which, at variance with the other effects, is dose-independent.\r"

Remarkably, human sera containing HIV antibodies and simian sera containing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) antibodies had a very narrow amino acid dependence in the 23 residue long peptide, 582Ala-604Cys, used as antigen. A single dominating antigenic site was demonstrated in the C-terminal part of the peptide--596Trp-602Gln for HIV-2 and SIV antibodies and 597Gly-602Leu for HIV-1. A minor fraction of HIV-1 antibodies also reacted with a second site, 588Lys and 589Asp. These data define the precise amino acid dependence of a uniquely immunogenic site in the folded transmembrane protein of HIV and facilitate the optimizing of peptide antigens for site-directed serology.\r"

DESIGN--Estimation of cost effectiveness was based, firstly, on a retrospective overview of 58 controlled trials and, secondly, on evidence about costs derived from data and observations of practice. SETTING--Trials included in the overview were from obstetric units in several different countries, including the United Kingdom. The costing study was based on data referring to the John Radcliffe Maternity Hospital, Oxford. SUBJECTS--A total of 7777 women were included in the 58 controlled trials comparing the effects of giving routine prophylactic antibiotics at caesarean section with either treatment with a placebo or no treatment. Cost estimates were based on data on 486 women who had caesarean sections between January and September 1987. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Cost effectiveness of prophylaxis with antibiotics. RESULTS--The odds of wound infection are likely to be reduced by between about 50 and 70% by giving antibiotics routinely at caesarean section. Forty one (8.4%) women who had caesarean section were coded by the Oxford obstetric data system as having developed wound infection. The additional average cost of hospital postnatal care for women with wound infection (compared with women who had had caesarean section and no wound infection) was estimated to be 716 pounds; introducing routine prophylaxis with antibiotics would reduce average costs of postnatal care by between 1300 pounds and 3900/100 pounds caesarean sections (at 1988 prices), depending on the cost of the antibiotic used and its effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS--The results suggest that giving antibiotics routinely at caesarean section will not only reduce rates of infection after caesarean section but also reduce costs.\r"

DESIGN--Single blind randomised prospective study of patients receiving physiotherapy, advice on mobilisation, or on an initial period of rest followed up after two years by postal questionnaire. SETTING--Accident and emergency department in urban hospital. PATIENTS--247 Consecutive patients (mean age at injury 30.6 years) presenting within 48 hours after injury with no pre-existing disease of the neck or serious skeletal injury. Of these, 167 patients responded to the questionnaire; 77 who responded but had not completed their treatment or review course were included in the analysis as a fourth group (non-attenders). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Presence of symptoms after two years. RESULTS--Of the 167 patients (68%) responding, the percentage of patients still with symptoms was not significantly different in those receiving rest or physiotherapy (46%, 12/26 v 44%, 24/54), but that in those receiving advice on early mobilisation was significantly lower (23%, 11/48, p = 0.02). Of the 104 patients without symptoms, 94 (90%) recovered within six months and 62 (60%) within three months. Patients without symptoms who received advice or physiotherapy wore a collar for a significantly shorter time than those with persistent symptoms (mean duration 1.4 (SD 0.7) months v 2.8 (1.6) months, p = 0.005 and 1.6 (1.1) months v 1.8 (1.3) months, p = 0.006 respectively). CONCLUSIONS--Advice to mobilise in the early phase after neck injury reduces the number of patients with symptoms at two years and is superior to manipulative physiotherapy. Prolonged wearing of a collar is associated with persistence of symptoms.\r"

Data were collected on all patients fulfilling criteria for brain stem death or considered suitable for donating organs after circulatory arrest. Forty two patients fulfilled the criteria for brain stem death, and in 10 further patients circulatory arrest occurred before formal testing was finished. The major causes of brain stem death were head injury (28) and intracranial haemorrhage (17). Consent to organ donation was obtained for 24 potential donors, and organs were donated by 23 of them. Twenty nine patients did not donate organs. The commonest reasons for failure to donate were medical unsuitability (13) and the coroner not releasing the body (eight). Consent was not sought in three cases, and the relatives refused consent in the remaining five. This study suggests that required request will not considerably increase the supply of donor organs.\r"

SUBJECTS--578 Of 855 men aged 60-85 responding to an invitation to participate. INTERVENTIONS--The subjects had their urine tested with a dipstick (Multistix) for the presence of blood and then tested their urine once a week for the next 10 weeks. Those with one or more positive test results were offered full urological investigation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--The prevalence of urological disease in those subjects with dipstick haematuria. RESULTS--78 Men (13%) had dipstick haematuria on a single test and a further 54 (9%) had evidence of dipstick haematuria when testing their urine once a week during a subsequent 10 week period. Investigation of 87 men disclosed urological disease in 45, including four with a bladder tumour and seven with epithelial dysplasia. CONCLUSION--Dipstick haematuria is a common incidental finding in men over 60 and is associated with appreciable urological disease. The introduction of less invasive methods of investigation, particularly flexible cystoscopy and ultrasonography, has made investigation of these patients simple and safe and makes screening for bladder cancer in the community more feasible.\r"

RESULTS--The doctor's and patient's questionnaires for each consultation were matched and the results analysed on a group basis. The response rate for individual questions was high (81-89%). The doctors and patients significantly disagreed about the doctors' ability to assess and put patients at ease, to offer explanations and advice on treatment, and to allow expression of emotional feelings and about the overall benefit that the patients gained from the consultation. In all cases of disagreement the doctor had a more negative view of the consultation than the patient. CONCLUSIONS--The results of giving structured questionnaires on consultations to both patients and doctors could be a useful teaching tool for established doctors or those in training to improve the quality and sensitivity of care they provide.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether patients with multiple myeloma treated in three consecutive clinical trials of chemotherapy of the Finnish Leukaemia Group during 1979-85 had a more favourable prognosis than both patients treated in the trial area before the trials and those treated in the rest of Finland. DESIGN--Comparison of the time trend in survival of patients living in the trial area with that of patients living in the rest of Finland. SETTING--Trial area covered 17 of the 21 main hospital districts in Finland (serving more than two thirds of patients with multiple myeloma). PATIENTS--663 Men and 690 women in the trial area and 318 men and 307 women in the reference area aged under 71 in whom multiple myeloma was diagnosed during 1959-85. In the trial area the disease was diagnosed in 455 men and 493 women in 1959-78 and in 208 men and 197 women in 1979-85; in the reference area it was diagnosed in 234 men and 227 women in 1959-78 and in 84 men and 80 women in 1979-85. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Five year cumulative relative survival rates during 1959-85, annual relative survival rates in the first seven years of follow up during 1979-85, and fitted annual relative survival rates in the first five years of follow up during 1959-85. RESULTS--During the first two years of follow up the annual relative survival rates did not differ between the two areas, but in the next five years of follow up patients in the trial area did better than those in the reference area. For cases diagnosed in 1979-85 the difference in the five year cumulative relative survival rates between patients in the trial area and those in the reference area was 10%, those in the trial area doing better. Generalised proportional hazards regression analysis of the first five years of follow up showed that the patients in the trial area had a survival advantage over those in the reference area. The model with the best fit included year of follow up, time of diagnosis, the joint effect of year of follow up and time of diagnosis, and the joint effect of area and time of diagnosis. CONCLUSION--The patients in the trial area benefited from the clinical trials, which suggests that the use of a treatment protocol improves the end results of treatment. In other words, the results favour a systematic treatment schedule in preference to a schedule determined by the free choice of a clinician.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of job loss on health an investigation was made of admissions to hospitals in 887 men five years before and three years after the closure of a Danish shipyard. The control group comprised 441 men from another shipyard. The information on hospital admissions was obtained from the Danish national register of patients. The relative risk of admission in the control group dropped significantly in terms of the number of men admitted from the study group from 1.29 four to five years before closure to 0.74 in the three years after closure. This was especially true of admissions due to accidents (1.33 to 0.46) and diseases of the digestive system (4.53 to 1.03). For diseases of the circulatory system, particularly cardiovascular diseases, the relative risk increased from 0.8 to 1.60, and from 1.0 to 2.6 respectively. These changes in risk of illness after redundancy are probably a consequence of a change from the effects of a high risk work environment to the effects of psychosocial stresses such as job insecurity and unemployment.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the current and potential roles of community pharmacists in the prevention of AIDS among misusers of injected drugs. DESIGN--Cross sectional postal survey of a one in four random sample of registered pharmacies in England and Wales. SETTING--Project conducted in the addiction research unit of the Institute of Psychiatry, London. SUBJECTS--2469 Community pharmacies in the 15 regional health authorities in England and Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Willingness of pharmacists to sell injecting equipment to known or suspected misusers of drugs; pharmacists' attitudes to syringe exchange schemes, keeping a \"sharps\" box for use by misusers of drugs, and offering face to face advice and leaflets; and opinions of community pharmacists on their role in AIDS prevention and drug misuse. RESULTS--1946 Questionnaires were returned, representing a response rate of 79%. This fell short of the target of one in four pharmacies in each family practitioner committee area in England and Wales, and total numbers of respondents were therefore weighted in inverse proportion to the response rate in each area. The findings disclosed a substantial demand for injecting equipment by drug misusers. After weighting of numbers of respondents an estimated 676 of 2434 pharmacies were currently selling injecting equipment and 65 of 2415 (3%) were participating in local syringe exchange schemes; only 94 of 2410 pharmacies (4%) had a sharps box for used equipment. There was a high degree of concern among pharmacists about particular consequences of drug misusers visiting their premises, along with a widespread acceptance that the community pharmacist had an important part to play. CONCLUSIONS--Promoting the participation of community pharmacists in the prevention of AIDS among misusers of injected drugs is a viable policy, but several problems would need to be overcome before it was implemented.\r"

DESIGN--A cervical smear register was established to determine which women were \"at risk\" of dysplasia. The results of colposcopy and treatment of dysplasia were analysed. SETTING--A large rural general practice with community hospital facilities in mid-Wales. PATIENTS--4437 Women at risk in a total practice population of 14,100. INTERVENTIONS--Colposcopy of women with dyskaryotic smear results, persistent inflammatory smear results, or vulval warts. Treatment of women with proved dysplasia by electrodiathermy of the cervix or cone biopsy. RESULTS--138 Women with dysplasia were diagnosed over five years: 36 mild, 97 moderate or severe, and five with microinvasion. Despite a 78% smear rate of at risk women over five years, nine invasive cancers still occurred. CONCLUSIONS--The results of treatment are acceptable. Cervical dysplasia has become very common, the risk of a dysplasia in women aged 20-39 who had smear tests being one in 14 over five years.\r"

RESULTS--315 Nulliparous women and 330 multiparous women were booked for confinement; 202 women transferred to consultant care before delivery and a further 104 during labour or after delivery. Recognised risk factors, other than nulliparity, rarely predicted the need for transfer. Confinement in the general practitioner unit was associated with low intervention and good fetal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS--The general practitioner maternity unit provides a safe alternative for confinement in low risk pregnancies. High rates of transfer deny this facility to many women who desire confinement in a low technology environment.\r"

Vital capacity (88% of predicted, p less than 0.05), and FEV1 (84%, p less than 0.01) were decreased in the study group, but spirometric and diffusion capacity abnormalities were moderate compared with previous studies. The single breath CO2 test showed, in six patients, ventilation-perfusion mismatch with patterns typical for either bronchial obstruction or vascular disease. Non-respiratory factors were responsible for reduction of working capacity (on average 68% of predicted normal values (p less than 0.001]. Two patients with pulmonary hypertension were identified by right heart catheterization. One of them had overlap features with the CREST syndrome. Both these patients had abnormal SBT-CO2 test and diffusion capacity, along with diffuse perfusion defects on perfusion scintigraphy. The low frequency of pulmonary function abnormalities in this study suggests that irreversible pulmonary damage is uncommon in SLE.\r"

To test this theory, we compared the effects of bolus injections of epinephrine vs. methoxamine on survival, hemodynamic variables, blood gases, and blood lactate concentrations during ventricular fibrillation and CPR in 12 dogs. Each dog underwent a 3-min fibrillatory arrest followed by 10 min of fibrillation and CPR, at which time the animals were defibrillated. Epinephrine (0.05 mg/kg, n = 6) or methoxamine (2 mg/kg, n = 6) was administered at the start of CPR. Both epinephrine and methoxamine produced identical survival rates (5/6) with no differences in coronary perfusion pressure gradients or blood gases (aortic, venous, or great cardiac venous pH, PaO2, or PaCO2) during CPR. Also, there were no differences between the two study groups in myocardial lactate or oxygen extraction ratios during CPR. We conclude that in the dosages tested in our experimental model, epinephrine and methoxamine produce similar results in the variables which we measured.\r"

Moreover, NaHCO3 resulted in a small decrease in intracellular brain pH as measured with P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance where Carbicarb afforded intracellular brain alkalinization (-0.03 +/- 0.01 vs. +0.08 +/- 0.02 pH units at 2 min, p less than .01). If these data are confirmed clinically, Carbicarb may offer advantages over NaHCO3 under conditions of fixed or limited ventilation.\r"

Since the palpebral conjunctiva is perfused by branches of the internal carotid artery, perfusion of this tissue may reflect global CBF. Conjunctival oxygen tension (PcjO2), PaO2, PaCO2, and pH were measured in ten healthy subjects during normal ventilation and active hyperventilation. CBF was measured simultaneously using positron emission tomography. CBF decreased from an average of 64.3 +/- 15.1 ml x 100 g-1 x min-1 during baseline measurements to 33.2 +/- 8.4 ml x 100 g-1 x min-1 during hyperventilation. The ratio of PcjO2 to PaO2 (the PcjO2/PaO2 index) decreased from 0.53 +/- 0.07 to 0.35 +/- 0.09 in the same time period. The PcjO2/PaO2 index was significantly correlated with CBF (r = .78, p less than .001). We conclude that the PcjO2/PaO2 index may reflect the reduction in CBF induced by hyperventilation in normal humans, and should be investigated further as a method of assessing CBF in other settings which can result in globally reduced cerebral perfusion.\r"

Hospital backup is desirable for high-risk patients, but the cost to benefit ratio may be unnecessarily high for low-risk patients. The demand for colonoscopic examinations is escalating, and cost containment has become an important issue. One way to reduce the cost is to eliminate the hospital component by performing the examination in the office. Over the past two and a half years, colonoscopy was performed on selected patients in the authors' office. Five hundred fifty-four office colonoscopies were performed to date, including biopsy or polypectomy in 348. Basic principles of safe intravenous sedation and colonoscopy were followed strictly. The cecum was reached in 92 percent of cases, and no significant complications were encountered. Office colonoscopy is a safe alternative to hospital colonoscopy. It confers significant cost savings to the patient and allows more efficient use of the physician's time.\r"

Depressed plasma FA concentrations in the glucose-infused state (median 51%, p less than 0.0001) were associated with lower unbound plasma VPA fractions (median 17%, p less than 0.0001). Unbound plasma VPA concentrations were notably lower in the glucose-infused state due to significantly higher (median 41%, p less than 0.0001) metabolic clearance, beta-oxidative metabolite formation clearance, representing the largest urinary dose fraction recovered, was significantly higher (median 60%, p less than 0.004) in the glucose-infused state.

Rats undergoing each treatment received a continuous steady-state infusion of VPA and a single intravenous (i.v.) bolus of 2-en-VPA. Elimination clearance of VPA was significantly higher (median 31%, p = 0.002) with glucose infusion as compared with fasting but was unchanged by clofibrate pretreatment as compared with control. Formation clearance of 2-en-VPA was significantly higher with glucose infusion as compared with fasting (median 147%, p = 0.001) and with clofibrate pretreatment as compared with control (median 73%, p = 0.041). Fractional metabolism of VPA by this route averaged 6% in fasted and control rats and 10% in glucose-infused and clofibrate-pretreated rats. Thus, VPA elimination clearance was not greatly influenced by effects on this route in rats. Elimination clearance of 2-en-VPA was also higher with glucose infusion as compared with fasting (median 149%, p = 0.002), and with clofibrate pretreatment as compared with control (median 167%, p less than 0.001). These observations are consistent with glucose-sparing release of endogenous fatty acids (FAs) to compete with VPA for beta-oxidation, and increased beta-oxidative activity after clofibrate treatment. The results of this study provide strong in vivo evidence for involvement of beta-oxidation in metabolism of VPA.\r"

The age of onset was mostly between 2 months and 2 years (more than two thirds of cases). Most had partial symptomatic epilepsy. In nine cases, epilepsy was preceded by febrile convulsions. Seizures at onset were of the following type (in order of decreasing occurrence): unilateral seizures, complex partial seizures, elementary partial seizures, and other seizures, often difficult to classify. A few patients with infantile spasms associated with focal or multifocal EEG abnormalities, differing from West's syndrome, were included in this study.

Thirty-three patients (72%) had complex partial seizures (CPS), and 11 patients (24%) had simple partial somatosensory seizures. Clinical seizures were recorded by EEG in 18 patients (39%), and a subclinical (larval) seizure was recorded in 1; those in 10 patients arose from a temporal lobe, 4 were from a frontal lobe, and in 5 they involved two adjacent lobes from onset. Several extra-ictal features reliably indicated lobe or hemisphere of seizure onset. The lobe of principal interictal EEG spikes corresponded to seizure origin in 33 of 34 patients (97%), and regional delta activity corresponded to lobe of seizure origin in 22 of 24 patients (92%). The seizures of all 13 patients with unilateral neurologic signs corresponded to the hemisphere implicated by the deficit. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed lesions in 30 patients (65%) and corresponded to the lobe of seizure onset in 27 of the 30 (90%). Seizures arose primarily from a frontal lobe in 22 of 46 patients (48%), from a temporal lobe in 14 patients (30%), and from an occipital-parietal-posterotemporal region in 6 patients (13%); only the hemisphere of origin could be determined in 4 patients. Cortical developmental abnormalities were the most common known cause (12 patients, 26%); febrile seizures and primary brain tumors occurred in 10 and 8 patients, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

History of anabolic steroid administration was recorded retrospectively, and results of semen analysis were compared with data from 41 consecutively recruited normal volunteers not using any steroids or other drugs. Doses of anabolic steroids taken by bodybuilders exceeded those generally applied for clinical purposes by up to 40-fold. Although only 5 of the normal volunteers had sperm counts below the lower normal limit of 20 x 10(6) sperm/mL, 24 of the bodybuilders showed subnormal values. Depending on the duration of anabolic steroid use and the period since last drug intake before the investigation, percentages of motile and normally formed sperm were significantly reduced in bodybuilders compared with normal volunteers. In those bodybuilders who had stopped consumption of anabolic steroids greater than 4 months previously, sperm numbers were in the normal range. Results suggest that even after prolonged use of extremely high doses of anabolic steroids, sperm production may return to normal.\r"

The use of a gonadotropin releasing-hormone agonist (Gn-RH-a) with hMG induction of ovulation may improve the therapeutic outcome. In this prospective, randomized trial, 27 women with PCOS underwent a total of 25 cycles of hMG alone and 33 cycles with adjunctive GnRH-a (leuprolide) treatment. Premature luteinization was seen less frequently in the leuprolide-treated cycles than in cycles treated with hMG alone. There were no differences between the treatments in ovarian sensitivity to hMG. Cycle fecundity was 0.16 for hMG alone cycles, and 0.27 for leuprolide with hMG cycles, which were not statistically different. We conclude that the sensitivity of the PCOS ovary to hMG is not affected by 4 weeks of leuprolide pretreatment.\r"

Results were compared with those from six women, matched for pretreatment uterine volume, who had been treated with goserelin alone. During combined therapy, plasma and urinary estrogen concentrations were significantly lower than during goserelin alone, whereas sex hormone binding globulin concentrations were significantly higher. Plasma luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were both suppressed, in contrast with results during goserelin alone when FSH levels remained within the pretreatment range. None of the women on combined therapy bled in response to the endocrine changes of the initial treatment cycle. Despite this profound pituitary-ovarian suppression, there was no significant change in uterine volume during combined therapy. These results suggest that tamoxifen is acting as an estrogen agonist in women rendered hypoestrogenic with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists.\r"

Nocturnal (6:00 P.M. to 9:00 A.M.) plasma melatonin levels were measured hourly by a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay before and after gonadotropin-ovarian downregulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-agonist. Although nocturnal melatonin elevations varied widely between girls, patterns within the same individual were remarkably reproducible and unaltered before and after treatment. Although estrogens have been shown to modulate melatonin synthesis and secretion, in this model, reduction of estrogen levels was not associated with alterations in plasma melatonin concentrations.\r"

To determine whether this requirement for exogenous calcium is a universal attribute of steroidogenic cells, we studied baseline and stimulated progesterone (P) production by cultured human granulosaluteal cells obtained at the time of oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization (IVF). During 4 hours in culture, both cholera toxin (1.25 micrograms/mL) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 1 IU/mL) stimulated a significant (P less than 0.05) 2- to 4-times increase in P production. Both baseline and stimulated (cholera toxin or hCG) increases in P were unaffected when cellular uptake of exogenous calcium was inhibited by the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine (10 microM), or by culturing the cells in calcium-free medium or in calcium-free medium with [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA, to chelate any possible free extracellular calcium). At later time points (24 and 48 hours), lack of available exogenous calcium began to have an inhibitory effect on P production, and the hCG effect was more sensitive to the lack of exogenous calcium than was the cholera toxin effect. We speculate that this apparent independence from exogenous calcium over a short culture period is due to the prior stimulation of these cells by exogenous gonadotropins employed in IVF cycles.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently demonstrated that ritanserin, a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist void of systemic effects, caused a significant reduction of portal pressure in conscious cirrhotic dogs. The mechanism by which ritanserin lowers portal pressure is poorly defined. We investigated the splanchnic and systemic hemodynamic effects of ritanserin (0.63 mg/kg body wt i.v., a dose known to completely inhibit binding of 5-hydroxytryptamine to its receptors), in conscious and unrestrained cirrhotic rats (n = 13). Heparinized catheters were placed into the portal vein, inferior vena cava, aorta, and left ventricle with exit from the neck. Hemodynamic studies were performed 4 h after consciousness was regained. Cardiac output and regional blood flows were measured using radiolabeled microspheres and the reference sample method. Sixty minutes after administration, ritanserin caused a significant reduction of portal pressure (-17%) with minimal changes in portal venous inflow (+3%). Portal vascular resistance decreased significantly (-23%), whereas splanchnic arteriolar resistance was similar before and after ritanserin. A significant increase in mean arterial pressure (+5%) and cardiac output (+22%) was observed. Our results suggest that ritanserin lowers portal pressure through a mechanism separate from portal venous inflow. This effect could be due to changes in intrahepatic or on portocollateral resistances, or both. These findings support the potential use of this new agent in the treatment of portal hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The distinctive biological properties of apolipoprotein A-IV suggest that its concentration in serum should be specifically regulated by dietary triglyceride. To test this hypothesis, serum lipids, lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein levels were measured in 10 normolipidemic male subjects whose dietary fat intake was isocalorically modified over a range of 10%-50% of total calories. Serum apolipoprotein A-IV levels changed significantly from baseline in response to each dietary modification. Apolipoprotein A-IV levels decreased by 21% during the first week of the low-fat (10%) diet, increased to 12% over baseline during the first week of the moderate-fat (25%) diet, and increased further to 35% over baseline during the first week of the high-fat (50%) diet. Unexpectedly, during the second week of each dietary period, apolipoprotein A-IV levels demonstrated statistically significant trends back toward baseline, which were opposite in direction and proportional in magnitude to the changes during the first week. Nonetheless, serum apolipoprotein A-IV levels, but not apolipoprotein A-I or apolipoprotein B levels, were significantly and positively correlated with the percent of total daily caloric intake ingested as dietary fat. It was concluded that serum apolipoprotein A-IV levels are extremely sensitive to acute changes in dietary fat content and over the range of fat intake examined in this study are significantly correlated with the percent of total calories consumed as dietary triglyceride. Furthermore, the results also suggest that apolipoprotein A-IV may be subject to a rapidly acting autoregulatory mechanism.\r"

This report describes an investigation of the effect of the prostaglandin E1 analogue, misoprostol, on cell migration and transit. 3H-thymidine was used to label those cells synthesizing deoxyribonucleic acid in dogs that had been given an oral dose of 300 micrograms/kg per day misoprostol for 11 weeks. The animals were killed at timed intervals, and tissue from the gastric fundus was prepared for autoradiography. The distribution of labeled cells at various times after labeling was used to follow the movement of the wave of label and to calculate median cell migration rates and transit times. The migration rate of cells toward the gastric lumen was significantly increased from 1.4 +/- 0.3 to 3.6 +/- 0.6 cell positions per day in the misoprostol-treated group (p less than 0.001); however, the gland length (from the most basal mucous neck cell to the luminal surface) was also increased (from 52.1 +/- 1.1 to 74.0 +/- 1.6; p less than 0.001), thus there was no significant difference in the (transit) time taken for cells to reach the top of the gland (control, 17.5 +/- 9.8 days; test, 12.2 +/- 7.1 days).\r"

  ".U": "90077670\r", 
  ".W": "A wealth of pharmacological and physiological evidence has established that anesthetics disrupt synaptic transmission at muscarinic and other synapses. The sequence of molecular events precipitated by agonist binding to the receptors is under intense scrutiny. It appears that at the majority of synapses G proteins serve to mediate the transfer of information from receptors to intracellular mechanisms. The major exception to this scheme is the situation in which an ion channel is incorporated directly in the receptor structure. Binding of an agonist to these receptors produces a conformational change in the receptors which opens an intrinsic ion channel. This situation occurs in nicotinic acetylcholine gamma-amino butyric acid type A (GABAA, and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptors). Assays have been developed to evaluate several steps in the cascade of events involved in synaptic signal transduction, and these assays have been employed to determine the step at which anesthetics act to disrupt synaptic transmission. We have demonstrated that several volatile anesthetics alter the interaction of muscarinic receptors with transducer G proteins. Ligand-binding experiments suggest that receptor-G protein complexes are stabilized, thereby disrupting G protein GTPase activity and muscarinic control of cellular activity. This \"stabilization\" does not appear to involve an inhibition of guanine nucleotide binding, the proximal event in receptor-G protein dissociation. Two possibilities warrant further consideration: (1) that GDP release from inactive G protein trimers, which is normally catalyzed by the receptor, is inhibited, and (2) that receptor-G protein complexes fail to dissociate even in response to GTP binding. We are currently examining these possibilities using purified G proteins and receptors in reconstituted systems.\r"

The legs of thirty embalmed and five fresh cadavera were dissected and mounted through the tibia to a frame so that multiple radiographs could be made with a constant relationship between the specimen and the x-ray apparatus. A standardized pronation-external rotation load was applied to the foot, and widening of the syndesmosis was studied on mortise radiographs that were made after each experimental step. On the basis of previous investigations, we developed a model for pronation-external rotation injuries that included disruption of the syndesmosis and interosseous membrane up to the level of the fibular fracture. Accordingly, multiple repaired fibular fractures could be simulated at several levels in the same specimen by incremental proximal division of the interosseous membrane. Specimens were separated into two groups. Group I consisted of thirteen specimens in which the deltoid ligament, syndesmosis, and interosseous membrane were serially sectioned in 1.5-centimeter increments. Group II (ten sections) was subjected to the same protocol, except that the deltoid ligament was kept intact until the final step. The five fresh specimens were sectioned in the same way as those in Group I. In Group I, since the simulated pronation-external rotation injury included a deltoid tear, rigid medial fixation was not possible; accordingly, there was rigid fibular fixation only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Six unrelated families with genetically determined structural variants of apo A-I were found in the course of an electrophoretic screening program for apo A-I variants in dried blood samples of newborns. The following structural variations were identified by the combined use of HPLC, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), and automated gas phase sequencing: Pro3----Arg (1x), Pro4----Arg (1x), and Pro165----Arg (4x). All variant carriers were heterozygous for their mutant of apo A-I. Subjects heterozygous for apo A-I(Pro165----Arg) (n = 12) were found to exhibit lower mean values for apo A-I (109 +/- 16 mg/dl) and HDL cholesterol (37 +/- 9 mg/dl) than unaffected family members (n = 9): 176 +/- 41 and 64 +/- 18 mg/dl, respectively (P less than 0.001). In 9 of 12 apo A-I(Pro165----Arg) variant carriers the concentrations of apo A-I were below the fifth percentile of sex-matched controls. By two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis as well as by densitometry the relative concentration of the variant apo A-I in heterozygous carriers of apo A-I(Pro165----Arg) was determined to account for only 30% of the total plasma apo A-I mass instead of the expected 50%. Thus, the observed apo A-I deficiency may be largely a consequence of the decreased concentration of the variant apo A-I. In the case of the apo A-I(Pro3----Arg) mutant, densitometry of HDL apolipoproteins demonstrated a distinctly increased concentration of the variant proapo A-I relative to normal proapo A-I. This phenomenon was not observed in the apo A-I(Pro4----Arg) mutant or in other mutants. This suggests that the interspecies conserved proline residue in position 3 of mature apo A-I is functionally important for the regular enzymatic conversion of proapo A-I to mature apo A-I.\r"

Osmotic minipumps containing either NE or saline were implanted subcutaneously in dogs for 3-4 wk. Physiologic desensitization to isoproterenol was confirmed in conscious dogs, i.e., left ventricular dP/dt increased in response to isoproterenol (0.4 micrograms/kg per min) by 5,625 +/- 731 mmHg/s in control dogs with saline pumps, and significantly less, P less than 0.01, by 2,093 +/- 263 mmHg/s in dogs with NE pumps. Myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density as determined with 125I-cyanopindolol binding was 49% higher (p less than 0.05) in the NE pump group. However, beta-adrenergic receptor agonist binding with isoproterenol demonstrated a significant shift into the low affinity state for the animals with NE pumps. Basal, GTP plus isoproterenol, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, sodium fluoride, and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the NE pump group were significantly depressed (P less than 0.05) by amounts ranging from 20 to 40%. The functional activity of the guanine nucleotide binding protein Gs was also reduced (P less than 0.05) in animals with NE pumps. Thus, the process of desensitization in response to chronic elevation of NE levels in intact, normal dogs does not involve a decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor density. Rather, it is characterized by reduced adenylate cyclase activation and uncoupling of the beta-adrenergic receptor in association with decreased activity of the GTP-coupling protein Gs.\r"

In serum-free media NH4Cl (0-20 mM) caused JTC cells and a primary culture of rabbit proximal tubule cells to hypertrophy (increase in cell protein content) in a dose-dependent fashion without a change in DNA synthesis. Studies in JTC cells revealed that the cell protein content increased as a result of both an increase in protein synthesis and a decrease in protein degradation. Total cell RNA content and ribosome number increased after NH4Cl exposure and the cell content of the lysosomal enzymes cathepsin B and L decreased. Inhibition of the Na+/H+ antiporter with amiloride did not prevent the hypertrophic response induced by NH4Cl. The results indicate that ammonia is an important modulator of renal cell growth and that hypertrophy can occur in the absence of functioning Na+/H+ antiport activity.\r"

  ".W": "Antibody opsonins from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients were investigated using nonmucoid and mucoid lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immunotype 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa as bacterial ligands and PMN phagocytes. CF sera were compared to normal sera, polyvalent PA LPS hyperimmune globulin, and isotype switch variant monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for type 1 PA LPS. Sera from PA-infected CF patients (CF PA+) had elevated levels of PA LPS and alginate IgG antibodies and promoted significantly greater antibody-dependent PMN chemiluminescence responses than sera from uninfected CF patients (CF PA-) or normal human sera (NHS). After adjustment for autologous IgG PA LPS antibody content, however, CF PA+ sera had less antibody-dependent opsonic activity than sera from CF PA- patients (P less than 0.025) or NHS (P less than 0.0025), suggesting qualitative opsonic defects of IgG PA LPS antibodies in CF PA+ sera. Antigen-specific immunoprecipitation of PA LPS antibodies enhanced opsonization by 40% of CF PA+ sera while uniformly reducing that from CF PA- sera (P less than 0.01), indicating LPS-specific nonopsonic antibodies in some CF PA+ sera. Alginate antibodies were not critical opsonins in most uninfected CF patient sera. PA LPS IgG antibodies isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from NHS, hyperimmune globulin, and CF PA- sources were opsonic and had greater activity at equal antigen-binding concentration than identical antibodies isolated from infected CF patients (P less than 0.01-0.05); the majority of isolates from CF PA+ sera did not promote PMN oxidative responses above nonopsonic baseline. A potential isotypic basis for these findings was supported by differences in PMN responses to PA opsonized with MAbs of identical specificity but differing isotypes. PA LPS-specific IgG antibodies inhibiting PMN oxidative responses in infected patient sera demonstrate antigen-specific immunomodulation of host responses by chronic bacterial parasitism in CF, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of lung disease.\r"

  ".U": "90078637\r", 
  ".W": "AA is metabolized by a cytochrome P450, NADPH-dependent epoxygenase to four regioisomeric epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). The EETs are further hydrated enzymatically to their respective diols, vic-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs). We studied the effect of pretreatment with DHETs on 10 microU/cm2 arginine vasopressin (AVP)-stimulated hydraulic conductivity (Lp) (Lp x 10(-7) cm/atm/s, mean +/- SE) in rabbit cortical collecting ducts (CCDs) perfused in vitro at 37 degrees C. At 10(-6) M all four DHETs were potent inhibitors of the hydroosmotic effect of AVP. 14,15-DHET was the most potent isomer; it reduced AVP-induced Lp from a control value of 234.75 +/- 11.7, n = 17, to a value of 95.2 +/- 8.39, n = 5, P less than 0.0001, a reduction of AVP-mediated water flow of 60%. The inhibitory effect of 14,15-DHET was dose dependent and significant to nanomolar concentrations. 14,15-DHET at 10(-7) M was as potent an inhibitor of AVP's activity as was 10(-7) M PGE2. AVP's hydroosmotic effect is mediated through its intracellular second messenger, cAMP. 8-p-Chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CcAMP) at 10(-4) M induced a peak Lp of 189.6 +/- 11.0, n = 8; pretreatment with 10(-6) M 14,15-DHET reduced CcAMP-peak Lp to 132.0 +/- 13.4, n = 5, P less than 0.01, demonstrating a post-cAMP effect. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy suggests that EETs are present in extracts purified from CCDs. We conclude that cytochrome P450 epoxygenase eicosanoids are potent inhibitors of the hydroosmotic effect of vasopressin and are endogenous constituents of normal CCDs, the major target tissue for AVP.\r"

  ".W": "Proteins of extracellular matrix undergo over time multiple reactions with glucose to form advanced glycosylation endproducts (AGEs) which are highly active in protein crosslinking, and have been implicated in tissue damage associated with aging and diabetes. A macrophage/monocyte receptor for AGE moieties mediates the uptake of AGE-modified proteins by a process that also induces cachectin/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 secretion. Reasoning that cytokines might regulate this AGE-receptor system, we have evaluated the effect of cachectin/TNF, IL-1, and IFN-gamma on AGE-protein processing. We report that cachectin/TNF induced a severalfold enhancement of binding, endocytosis, and degradation of AGE-BSA by both murine peritoneal macrophages and human blood monocytes in vitro, and that cachectin/TNF enhanced the rate of disappearance of AGE-modified red blood cells in vivo. IL-1 and IFN-gamma alone did not increase AGE processing, but IFN-gamma consistently enhanced cachectin/TNF-induced changes in AGE-receptor kinetics. Similar effects were induced by AGE-BSA and FFI-BSA, a chemically synthesized AGE, when used as macrophage stimulants, possibly via cachectin/TNF induction. All upregulatory responses were blocked by anticachectin/TNF monoclonal antibody. These data suggest that AGE-induced cachectin/TNF, in addition to influencing tissue regeneration and remodelling, may also normally regulate the disposal of tissue damaging AGE-proteins through an autocrine upregulation.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating T cells from four patients with the hyper-IgE syndrome were found to produce significantly lower concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) than did T cells from eight age-matched healthy controls, three patients with atopic dermatitis and one patient with chronic granulomatous disease. A clonal analysis revealed that patients with hyper-IgE syndrome had markedly lower proportions of circulating T cells able to produce IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in comparison with controls. In contrast, the proportions of peripheral blood T cells able to produce IL-4 or IL-2 were not significantly different in patients and controls. All the four patients with hyper-IgE syndrome showed high proportions of circulating CD4+ helper T cells able to induce IgE synthesis in allogeneic B cells, as well. Such an activity for IgE synthesis appeared to be positively correlated with IL-4 production by T cells and inversely related to the ability of the same T cells to produce IFN-gamma. Since IFN-gamma exerts an inhibitory effect on the synthesis of IgE and both IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha play an important role in inflammatory reactions, we suggest that the defective production of IFN-gamma may be responsible for hyperproduction of IgE and the combined defect of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha may contribute to the undue susceptibility to infections seen in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome.\r"

PBMC were cultured at 37 degrees C for 24 h in the absence or presence of 10(-16) to 10(-4) M hydrocortisone. Calcium ionophore (A23187)-activated neutrophils (PMN) primed by supernatants of PBMC from asthmatic subjects cultured in the absence of hydrocortisone generated approximately threefold more leukotriene B4 than PMN primed by supernatants of PBMC from normal subjects (P less than 0.05). Incubation of PBMC derived from CS subjects with 10(-8) M hydrocortisone completely inhibited the production of the enhancing activity (P less than 0.01), whereas in CR subjects hydrocortisone at concentrations up to 10(-4) M did not suppress the release of enhancing activity. The enhancing activity was produced by monocytes. Enhancing activity eluted with an Mr of 3,000 D and a pI of 7.1. It eluted at 10% acetonitrile after reverse-phase HPLC. The activity was destroyed by heating to 60 degrees C for 60 min and was sensitive to pronase treatment. The purified factor also enhanced superoxide generation by PMN which had been stimulated submaximally by phorbol myristate acetate.\r"

  ".U": "90078657\r", 
  ".W": "The current studies were designed to investigate the functional significance of elevated endogenous atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in acute congestive heart failure (CHF). Integrated cardiorenal and endocrine function were measured in three models of acute low-output congestive heart failure with comparably reduced cardiac output (CO) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Acute CHF was produced by rapid right ventricular pacing (group I, n = 5) which decreases CO and increases atrial pressures and plasma ANF. In group II, n = 5, thoracic inferior vena caval constriction (TIVCC) was produced to decrease venous return and CO but without increases in atrial pressure or plasma ANF. In group III, n = 5, TIVCC was performed and exogenous ANF infused to achieve plasma concentrations observed in acute CHF. In acute CHF with increases in endogenous ANF, sodium excretion (UNaV), renal blood flow (RBF), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone (PA) were maintained despite decreases in CO and MAP. In contrast, TIVCC with similar reductions in CO and MAP but without increases in ANF resulted in decreases in UNaV and RBF and increases in PRA and PA. Exogenous administration of ANF in TIVCC to mimic levels in acute CHF prevented sodium retention, renal vasoconstriction, and activation of renin and aldosterone. These studies demonstrate that endogenous ANF serves as an important physiologic volume regulator in acute CHF to maintain sodium excretion and possibly participate in the suppression of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system despite the stimulus of arterial hypotension.\r"

The sample consisted of 19 non-ambulatory women, ranging in age from 67 to 105 years, with documented SDAT, who reside in a long-term-care facility. Dietary intake was recorded, and feeding practices were observed for a 3-day period. The mean daily energy intake was 1,558 kcal, with a mean protein intake of 65 gm during the study. Nutritional supplements, consisting of fortified beverages and/or puddings, provided 29% of the calories and 41.5% of the protein intake while contributing considerable amounts of vitamins and minerals. Maintenance of optimal caloric and protein intake is difficult for advanced SDAT patients who are at high risk for infection and skin breakdown related to poor swallowing ability, incontinence, and immobility. Four major factors emerged that promoted optimal intake: using skillful feeding techniques, selecting appropriate food consistency, providing adequate time in which to feed, and capitalizing on the midday meal when cognitive abilities were at their peak.\r"

Plasmid fingerprinting and genomic REA are rapid and often more definitive alternatives to serotyping and biotyping. Isolation of specific plasmids for special study involves more complicated manipulations. Polypeptide patterns, though at times diffuse in appearance, can be easily produced with SDS-PAGE of whole cells or outer membranes. Specific monoclonal antibodies as probes for individual proteins can generate more definitive answers about the exact type of protein(s) present. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLE) has become an ingenious tool for characterizing closely related nosocomial bacterial strains. The newest molecular methods using ribotyping, DNA probes, and the PCR will open many doors into the microbial genomes that were previously closed to the hospital microbial detective. These advances will compel hospitals to plan for their funding and implementation. Yet, like other scientific progress, the new biology in the nosocomial setting will raise as many questions as it will answer.\r"

The murine B cell leukemia, BCL1B1, was transfected with mu and kappa genomic sequences and VS107 V regions that conferred a T15 Id and phosphocholine-binding specificity upon the cells. Transfected cells were treated with both the T-dependent Ag phosphorylcholine-key-hole limpet hemocyanin (PC-KLH), and 0.5 ng/ml purified IL-5. After 3.5 days steady state mu-mRNA levels increased three- to fourfold over mu-mRNA levels obtained from untreated cultures, or cultures treated with IL-5 or PC-KLH alone. IL-5 alone caused increased Ig secretion and a nearly twofold increase in proliferation. Additionally, cells treated with PC-KLH alone were able to process the Ag and present it to T cells as shown by subsequent lymphokine production. Thus, both Ag and IL-5 used singly appear to interact with their respective receptors, although neither Ag nor IL-5 increased mu-mRNA levels when used singly. The production of increased mu-mRNA levels obtained with Ag plus IL-5 required polymerase II transcription, suggesting that they may act to increase Ig transcription directly.\r"

Lower doses of CsA were necessary to prolong class I-disparate grafts than to prolong class II-disparate grafts than to prolong whole MHC-disparate grafts. Second set skin grafts, even of class I-only disparity, could not be prolonged even by higher doses of CsA. Primary class I-disparate grafts, which survived at a low dose of CsA, were rejected at the same dose if a second inducer graft was also placed expressing the same class I Ag plus other mismatched class II Ag. A suboptimal dose of CsA was synergistic with an anti-CD4 mAb but not with an anti-CD8 antibody for whole MHC-mismatched grafts. These results support the notion that CsA interferes with helper T cell function in vivo and suggest that CD8+ helper function is particularly sensitive to CsA suppression.\r"

In previous studies using anti-Leu 13, Leu 13 Ag has been detected on endothelial cells (EC) of arteries, capillaries, and veins in human tissue sections. In contrast, in this study using the same antibody, Leu 13 Ag could not be detected on unstimulated cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by indirect immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase staining, or immunoisolation of radiolabeled Ag from labeled endothelial cells. However, when HUVEC were cultured with IFN-gamma, Leu 13 Ag was demonstrable using all three detection techniques. Leu 13 Ag was detectable after 24 h of incubation with IFN-gamma (30 U/ml) and was maximally expressed after 72 h. After removal of IFN-gamma, Leu 13 Ag progressively declined back to basal levels by 4 days. Induction of Leu 13 Ag expression by IFN-gamma was suppressed by cycloheximide. Although Leu 13 Ag expression was also induced by IFN-alpha, PMA, and IL-1 were inactive. When HUVEC were incubated with IFN-gamma, surface-labeled with 125I, and then solubilized, anti-Leu 13 immunoisolated a 16-kDa radioactive band that comigrated with Leu 13 immunoisolated from T cells. Similar results were obtained using HUVEC that were metabolically labeled with 35S-methionine. These results demonstrate that HUVEC stimulated with IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha express Leu 13 Ag on their surface and suggest that exposure of EC to IFN may induce EC to develop new functional properties at sites of inflammatory and immune reactions.\r"

It also inhibits the fusion between uninfected CD4+ cells and HIV-1-infected cells to form syncytia. As a step to explore the potential utility of the anti-HIV antibody in vivo, we have constructed a mouse-human chimeric antibody by rDNA techniques. The chimeric antibody, which bears the variable domains of mouse antibody BAT123 and constant domains Cr1 and C kappa of human Ig retains the Ag specificity of BAT123 as determined by its reactivity with HIV-1-infected H9 cells, gp120 in Western blot analysis, and the oligopeptide recognized by BAT123. The antiviral activities of the chimeric antibody in neutralizing HIV-1 infection as well as inhibiting the syncytia formation are also found identical to those of the parent murine antibody. Moreover, in the presence of human blood mononuclear cells, the chimeric antibody but not BAT123 (mouse IgG1) induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The findings point to the potential usefulness of the chimeric antibody in treating patients infected with HIV-1.\r"

We recently found that provision of a mitogenic signal to PBMC, by incubation with the oxidizing mitogens, enhanced the effect of IL-2 in generating cytolytic activity. We therefore searched for a mitogen that might safely be administered to patients. The present study is an investigation of the mitogenic properties of iron and tin (Sn)-protoporphyrin and their capacity to induce cytotoxicity in human PBMC. These agents have been administered to humans with little toxicity. Both iron- (hemin) and Sn-protoporphyrin induce mitogenicity in peripheral T cells. This effect is markedly enhanced by low concentrations of IL-2. Hemin and Sn-protoporphyrin, in combination with IL-2, increase IL-2R on PBMC. Hemin alone, and to a greater extent in combination with IL-2, induces cytotoxicity for NK-sensitive and NK-resistant cell lines. Sn-protoporphyrin, a more potent mitogen than hemin, fails to induce cytotoxicity, and has a marked inhibitory effect on cytotoxicity induced by IL-2. Hemin and Sn-protoporphyrin stimulate TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma production by PBMC. IL-2 is synergistic with the metalloporphyrins in eliciting this effect. Metalloporphyrin-induced mitogenesis has a stringent requirement for macrophages. Scavengers of oxygen-free radicals and inhibitors of peroxidase inhibit mitogenicity induced by hemin but not that induced by Sn-protoporphyrin. Hence, an oxidative event may mediate the mitogenic effect of hemin. Our results indicate that hemin is an immunostimulatory agent in vitro and the data warrant further evaluation of its in vivo immunostimulatory and antitumor effect.\r"

Inasmuch as all previous studies on perforin have been conducted with cultured CTL and NK cell lines, it is not clear whether perforin may play a role in the cytotoxicity mediated by CTL that have been primed in vivo. In this study, we investigated the presence of perforin in pancreata from nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, which have been studied as a model of autoimmune, insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus. Whereas adult NOD mice spontaneously develop diabetes, it is possible to induce diabetes in young, irradiated NOD mice by adoptive transfer of splenocytes obtained from diabetic donors. By means of immunohistochemical analysis, we were able to detect perforin Ag in a small subpopulation of CD8+/Thy-1+/asialo GM1-/CD4- lymphocytes in the pancreatic islets of animals undergoing both spontaneous and adoptive transfer-mediated insulitis. Perforin+/CD8+ lymphocytes were found in small clusters and were observed to display the morphology of large granular lymphocytes. These observations show for the first time the presence of perforin-containing CD8+ lymphocytes in tissues of animals undergoing autoimmune disease.\r"

Previous test of this model revealed qualitative differences in the antigenic requirement for lymphokine release between activated T cell populations with the same apparent specificity when activated under different conditions. We now have found a case where class I MHC-reactive T cells (class I T cells) can modulate the nature of Ag-triggered lymphokine release from class II MHC-reactive T cells (class II T cells). Two significant requirements for this modulation event are: 1) Linked recognition/presentation of class I and class II Ag; that is, class I and class II MHC alloantigens must be presented on the same APC, and 2) active participation of the APC in this process; metabolic inactivation of the APC abrogates the class I T cell modulation of the class II activated T cell. These results suggest a novel form of T-T collaboration that involves the active participation of the APC, and provides evidence that T cells of one MHC specificity (class I) can influence the function of T cells of another MHC specificity (class II).\r"

In earlier work by others, anti-BrMRBC hybridomas prepared by using CBA or NZB \"spontaneously activating\" peritoneal B cells were all found to produce mAb with a single common H chain V region sequence, by using a novel gene (VH11p), and a single common L chain V region sequence, a member of the Vk9 group (VkBrMp). We prepared anti-BrMRBC hybridomas by using LPS-activated B10.A splenic B cells in order to reveal the maximum available diversity in this repertoire. Data based on binding studies, Northern blot analyses with V region-specific probes, and mRNA nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that there is combining-site diversity in the repertoire of anti-BrMRBC hybridomas. There was considerable variation in trimethylammonium (a constituent of phosphatidyl choline) binding efficiency, and one of the anti-BrMRBC mAb showed no detectable binding. Northern blot analyses indicated 6 of 11 mAb to be of the VH11p/VkBrMp type, including one dual reactive anti-[BrMRBC + SRBC] mAb. Sequence analyses of the H chain V regions of four of the non-VH11p mAb revealed utilization of four distinct VH, three of which are very similar to the VH expressed by Ly-1+ B cell clones or lymphomas, as reported by others. However, because the VH11p/VkBrMp-type mAb were all relatively efficient at lysing BrMRBC and binding trimethylammonium, we suggest that affinity considerations may determine the selective predominance of B cells with this V region configuration from an available repertoire of considerable diversity.\r"

  ".W": "The primary antibody response of mice to phosphorylcholine (PC) is dominated by antibodies using the T15 L chain. Anti-PC antibodies using the 511 L chain are prominent only in secondary responses to PC coupled to proteins, are somatically mutated, and all have an extra amino acid at the Vh-D junction, compared with T15 antibodies. The aim of the experiments reported here was to determine if the extra junctional amino acid alone was sufficient to generate a 511 PC-binding antibody, or if somatic mutation or other junctional changes were also necessary. We also wished to determine if unmutated 511 antibodies had sufficient affinity for PC to appear in the primary response. To increase the frequency of primary 511 antibodies, we generated a series of hybridomas from M167 L chain transgenic mice immunized 4 days earlier with either Streptococcus pneumonia R36a or PC-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). We determined the relative affinity of the antibodies, and sequenced their H chain V regions. The results showed that: 1) somatic mutations are not required for 511 antibodies to bind PC; 2) primary 511 antibodies all had lower relative affinities for PC than T15 while having similar affinities to T15 for TNP-aminophenyl PC, and higher affinities for the PC analogs nitrophenyl PC and choline; 3) all antibodies had the 511-specific insertion of an extra amino acid, usually Ala, at the VhD junction, compared with T15; 4) immunization with R36a, but not PC-hemocyanin, elicited antibodies with a specific Tyr----Asp substitution in the D region, indicating Ag selection based on fine specificity differences; 5) the total length of CDR3 was conserved in most anti-PC-hemocyanin antibodies, whereas the anti-R36a antibodies predominantly had longer CDR3 sequences; and 6) there were unique substitutions in most antibodies, including significant sequence heterogeneity in the D-Jh junction. We conclude that Ag selection on the basis of affinity for PC biases the primary anti-PC response in favor of T15, and that 511 precursors with their alternative fine specificities contribute the precursors that are expanded in the secondary anti-PC-KLH responses.\r"

LH9G4 bound to Fab fragments of AAC and was affinity-purified on an AAC column. LH9G4 inhibited the binding of aldosterone to AAC in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.5 nM as determined by competitive inhibition assays in ELISA and RIA. LH9G4 and aldosterone have similar relative affinities for AAC. Kinetic studies and Scatchard plot analysis support a reversible and reciprocal competitive inhibition mechanism between LH9G4 and aldosterone for the paratope of AAC. The possibility of a steric hindrance mechanism was eliminated. No cross-reactivity was seen with six other murine anti-aldosterone mAb, with a rabbit polyclonal antibody or with aldosterone receptor. The anti-idiotypic antibody, defined as a \"restricted\" internal image of aldosterone, is apparently directed at a private idiotope present in the paratope of AAC but not in binding sites of other aldosterone-binding proteins. Biophysical considerations involving characteristics of nonbonded attractive forces can explain these findings. An advantage of the one-step auto-anti-idiotypic procedure for the generation of Ab2-beta or internal image antibodies is discussed.\r"

The dominance of this idiotype among secondary immune response anti-Ars antibodies has been explained by the Ag-driven selection of favorable somatic mutants of this gene segment combination, associated with an intrinsic Ars-affinity of the germ-line V region higher than that of other possible combinations. To determine the effect of junctional diversity upon affinity for Ag, independently of somatic mutation, we determined the V region sequences and affinity for Ars of five primary response antibodies. These antibodies share identical unmutated V regions but differ only at the D gene junctions. Among the five antibodies, Ars-affinity differed up to 10-fold depending upon the identity of the amino acid residues at the VH-D and the D-JH junctions. The combination of junctional residues observed in two primary response antibodies with relatively low Ars-affinity has not been observed among secondary response antibodies. Thus the identity of junctional residues resulting from gene rearrangement prior to antigen stimulation must be taken into account in hypotheses which account for idiotype dominance by selection on the basis of affinity.\r"

We examined VKII L chains because it is the most common VL family expressed in the anti-Hib-PS response. Comparison of VKII amino acid sequences, including the entire CDR2 and CDR3 regions, of five anti-Hib-PS clonal antibodies from four unrelated individuals revealed complete identity with the exception of a single CDR3 residue from one antibody. When the sequence of these antibodies was compared with known VKII genes and myeloma proteins, it was found to be identical to the human VKII gene, A2, whose genomic sequence is presented here. In addition, all five of the VKII anti-Hib-PS antibodies examined contain an arginine inserted at the V-J junction. Finally, in contrast to the extraordinary homology of the VKII-encoded residues, there is variability in the JK gene utilization by these antibodies. These results demonstrate that the most common L chain V region in IgG anti-Hib-PS antibodies is the product of a single germ-line gene. The invariant arginine insertion suggests that this residue has an important role in Ag binding.\r"

We sequenced the V regions of 14 kappa and lambda-bearing group II antibodies. Both types show extensive somatic mutations. The pattern of the mutations differs between kappa and lambda antibodies. The nature of the somatic mutation in lambda chains suggests strong Ag selection on the L chain but not the H chain of the lambda-bearing antibodies. The reverse pattern of selection was observed among kappa-containing antibodies wherein the accumulation of replacement mutations in the CDR of the H chain appears to result from selection while changes in the L chain appear unselected. From these findings it appears that somatic mutation plays a major role in anti-PC-keyhole limpet hemocyanin memory development because all 14 antibodies displayed changes from germ-line sequences.\r"

  ".U": "90079024\r", 
  ".W": "Cytochrome b558, an essential component of the respiratory burst of phagocytic cells, is the terminal electron donor to molecular oxygen that results in the formation of superoxide anion (O2-.). It is an integral membrane heterodimer that in neutrophils consists of a 22-kDa small subunit and a highly glycosylated 91-kDa large subunit. Identical core proteins often differ in glycosylation in different cell types and with some membrane glycoproteins, the glycosylation state may markedly affect function. In the present study, antisera reactive with cytochrome b558 large subunit was used for immunoblot analysis of the glycosylation pattern of this subunit from different types of phagocytic cells. Striking variability in the apparent m.w. of this broadly banding subunit was detected in five different phagocytic cell types (neutrophils 78,000 to 93,000; eosinophils 74,000 to 115,000; monocytes 82,000 to 99,000; dibutyryl cyclic AMP-induced HL-60 cells 79,000 to 103,000; dimethyl sulfoxide-induced HL-60 cells 77,000 to 110,000). However, after complete cleavage of N-linked oligosaccharides with endoglycosidase F, the core peptide of cytochrome b558 large subunit from these different cell types had the same Mr (58,000). Inhibition of N-glycosylation with tunicamycin in differentiating HL-60 cells resulted in the synthesis of immunoreactive protein of the same m.w. and banding pattern as seen after endoglycosidase F cleavage. These tunicamycin treated cells retained some capacity to generate superoxide anion when stimulated with PMA. We conclude that the identity of the N-linked oligosaccharides of the cytochrome b558 large subunit differ in various phagocytic cells. All N-linked glycans on cytochrome b558 in all cell types examined were of the complex type as defined by resistance to endoglycosidase H cleavage. N-linked glycosylation of the cytochrome b558 large subunit may not be essential for activation of the respiratory burst.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the positive and negative effects of IFN-gamma, PMA, dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP), dexamethasone and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on Fc gamma R subtype expression and phagocytosis of a human monoblast cell line, U937. IFN-gamma increased and Bt2cAMP decreased Fc gamma RI expression determined by a mAb 32.2, whereas PMA and Bt2cAMP increased Fc gamma RII expression determined by a mAb IV-3. Phagocytosis was measured microscopically by counting ingested aggregated human IgG- or BSA-treated ox E (Eo'-IgG or Eo'-BSA). IFN-gamma increased the phagocytosis of Eo'-IgG but not that of Eo'-BSA, and PMA increased the phagocytosis of both Eo'-IgG and Eo'-BSA. Bt2cAMP decreased both basal and IFN-gamma- and PMA-augmented phagocytosis of U937 cells. Dexamethasone also inhibited both basal and IFN-gamma-augmented Fc gamma RI expression and PMA-augmented Fc gamma RII expression and phagocytosis, but did not affect IFN-gamma-augmented phagocytosis of Eo'-IgG. The augmentation of phagocytosis of Eo'-IgG by IFN-gamma thus seems to be due mainly to the increased internalizing process rather than to increased Fc gamma RI expression. TGF-beta slightly decreased Fc gamma R expression. In a study of the participation of protein kinase C (PK-C), it was found that H-7, a PK-C inhibitor, did not inhibit either IFN-gamma- or PMA-enhanced Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII expression, respectively, and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol and N-(6-phenylhexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, both PK-C activators, did not show any apparent increase in Fc gamma R expression and phagocytosis. These results show that Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII expression on U937 cells is regulated by different mechanisms and that IFN-gamma and PMA play their roles in Fc gamma R expression and phagocytosis by different pathways. It is possible that cAMP but not PK-C plays an important role in the regulation of Fc gamma R expression and phagocytosis.\r"

We have analyzed the use of H and L chain V region genes in the early (day 7) and late response (hyperimmune) and have sequenced the dominant VH gene used in several of our hybridomas. Our data allowed us to assess the extent to which the recombination of various V, D, and J gene segments and somatic mutation contribute to antibody diversification in this system. In this report we confirm that a minimum of two VH and four VK gene segments are used to encode this response. We extend this analysis to show that multiple D and J gene segments are used and that a significant amount of junctional variability is tolerated in CDR 3. Our results indicate that the level of somatic mutation in the hyperimmune response is generally low in comparison with the response to haptens and protein Ag. These data also suggest that there is a positive selection for mutation in CDR 1 during the hyperimmune response to group A streptococcal CHO.\r"

With respect to antibody responses, the B10.BR mice had 3- to 10-fold more serum IgE and T. spiralis-specific IgG1 and IgA than AKR mice. The B10.BR mice also had greater numbers of IgG and IgA plaque-forming cells than AKR mice. In contrast, AKR mice produced T. spiralis-specific IgG2a, whereas the B10.BR mice did not. The antibody response kinetics of these strains were similar. We also analyzed lymphokine secretion after restimulating lymphocytes in vitro with T. spiralis Ag. The AKR mesenteric lymph node cells produced more IFN-gamma and less IL-4 than the B10.BR mesenteric lymph node cells. The B10.BR splenocytes produced more IL-4 than the AKR splenocytes, although splenocyte IFN-gamma production was not different. The kinetics of IL-4 production also differed between the two strains. In summary, resistant AKR mice produced more IFN-gamma and T. spiralis-specific IgG2a than susceptible B10.BR mice, which produced more IL-4, IgE, and T. spiralis-specific IgG1. Our results are consistent with differential activation of Th cell subsets in T. spiralis-infected AKR and B10.BR mice.\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxic T cell responses to the murine Cytomegalovirus (MCMV) were elicited in BALB/c mice (H-2d) by infectious virus. Eight days after infection, MCMV-primed local lymph node T cells were either depleted for T cells expressing a V beta 8+ TCR or separated into V beta 8+ and V beta 8- subpopulations by a cell sorter using the mAb F23.1. T cells were then expanded in vitro under limiting dilution conditions in the presence of IL-2 and in the absence of viral Ag to avoid selection by Ag in vitro. Frequencies of CTL precursors specific for the Immediate-Early-Ag 1 of MCMV and restricted to H-2Ld were determined. L cells of the endogenous haplotype H-2k cotransfected with the genes for MCMV-IE 1 and H-2Ld were used as target cells. Detection of a CTL response required previous priming of the animals by infection in vivo (less than 1/10(6) for nonimmunized animals). In primed animals CTL precursors of this specificity and restriction were three to fivefold more frequent in the V beta 8+ population (1/9.900 to 1/22.300) than in the V beta 8- population (1/57.000 to 1/87.200). Control experiments showed that frequencies were not influenced by the treatment with the anti-V beta 8-antibody and the fluorescein-labeled anti-Ig itself. V beta 8+ and V beta 8- T cells did not reveal any frequency differences when several other responses were determined (TNP-specific self-restricted CTL precursor; Th cells specific for keyhole limpet hemocyanin or Listeria monocytogenes).\r"

  ".W": "The capacity of BALB/c mice to acquire resistance to and eliminate intracellular visceral Leishmania donovani is T cell dependent, associated with a granulomatous tissue reaction, and correlates with the ability to secrete the macrophage-activating lymphokine, IFN-gamma. These responses appear by 4 wk after infection and are fully established by 8 wk. To examine the role of endogenous IFN-gamma, BALB/c mice were injected with anti-IFN-gamma mAb before and for 8 wk after infection. At 4 wk, mAb treatment inhibited the acquisition of resistance to L. donovani and abolished mature granuloma formation. Although liver parasite burdens in mAb-treated mice were fivefold higher than in controls at 8 wk, continually treated mice nevertheless began for form tissue granulomas and decreased their parasite loads by 50% from peak values. The levels of anti-IFN-gamma antibody in the serum of mice injected for 8 wk were appreciably reduced, thus raising the possibilities of either insufficient neutralization of endogenous IFN-gamma at this time point or a pathway independent of IFN-gamma. Although the role of IFN-gamma and the potential effect of an IFN-gamma-independent mechanism in the resolution of visceral infection remain to be defined, these results indicate that IFN-gamma plays a critical role in the early immune response that both optimally controls L. donovani infection and induces the tissue granuloma.\r"

Ten congenic strains of mice were immunized with irradiated sporozoites of Plasmodium yoelii. When challenged with viable sporozoites, only two strains had a high proportion of animals that did not develop blood stage infections. Immunity did not correlate with antisporozoite antibody levels. Two protective mechanisms exist determined by non-H-2 genes, and each mechanism is further controlled by H-2-linked Ir genes. On the BALB background only H-2d mice are protected, and protection is abolished by depleting CD8+ T cells. In contrast, on the B10 background only H-2q mice are strongly protected, and protection is not affected by CD8+ T cell depletion. If similar complex genetic regulation of immunity occurs in the human malarias, it will be a major hurdle for vaccine development.\r"

  ".W": "By traditional definitions, NK cells can be activated by cytokines to exhibit two functionally distinct levels of cytotoxicity. Whereas IL-2-mediated activation of NK cells leads to the development of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cytotoxicity, characterized by the acquisition of cytolytic activity against NK-resistant targets, IFN-treated NK cells become activated without the acquisition of novel cytolytic specificities. In this study we show that NK cells activated by 18 to 24 h of stimulation with either IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma do acquire LAK cytolytic activity, demonstrated by the ability of IFN-treated PBMC to lyse NK-resistant COLO 205 cells as well as fresh tumor targets. The level of IFN-alpha-induced LAK activity was significantly greater than that induced by IFN-gamma, although IL-2-induced LAK activity was considerably greater than IFN-alpha-induced LAK cytotoxicity. Maximal IFN-induced LAK cytotoxicity occurred after 24 h of culture, and occurred with the use of IFN-alpha at 500 U/ml and IFN-gamma at 1000 U/ml. Whereas neutralizing antibody experiments demonstrated that IFN-alpha-induced LAK activation did not involve the participation of endogenously produced IL-2, the partial inhibition (63%) of IFN-gamma-induced LAK cytotoxicity by anti-IL-2 and of IL-2-induced LAK by anti-IFN-gamma (33.3%) indicates that the induction of LAK cytotoxicity by either of these individual cytokines involves the endogenous production and participation of the other cytokine. Similar to IL-2-induced LAK cells, phenotypic analysis revealed that IFN-alpha/gamma LAK cells were Leu-19+, although the Leu 19\"dim\"+ subset exhibited greater IFN-induced LAK activity than the Leu-19\"bright\"+ subset. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma induce classic LAK activity and IFN-gamma plays a participatory role in the optimal induction of LAK cells by IL-2.\r"

The requirement for CD4+ Th cells to induce CD8+ CTL effectors in vivo was investigated by using C3H mice selectively depleted of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Rejection of the tumor was vigorous and indistinguishable from normal mice after depletion of CD4+ T cells in vivo. In contrast, in CD8+ T cell-depleted mice tumors grew progressively, confirming that T cells of the CD8+ lineage are required for a tumoricidal immune response, and cells of this lineage are sufficient for a primary response. Taken together, these results demonstrate that, in the absence of CD4+ T cells in vivo, unprimed cells of the CD8+ lineage are fully competent to mount an effective CTL immune response to syngeneic cells expressing novel class I Ag, consistent with the concept that only T cells with class I recognition specificity may be required to satisfy the need for both help and effector functions in the response.\r"

  ".W": "NK cells kill a wide variety of tumor cells, but usually leave normal cells intact. It was earlier reported that low class I HLA expression can be one of the factors that render target cells relatively susceptible to NK lysis. In this contribution, we show that in human melanomas the class I HLA expression is down-modulated by high expression of transfected c-myc oncogenes. The extent of down-modulation depended on the level of c-myc expression in a dose-dependent way. Taken together, these data suggested to us that one of the results of high c-myc expression could be the induction of a NK susceptible phenotype in melanoma cells. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of c-myc on NK susceptibility. We have found that high expression of transfected c-myc genes indeed converts the melanoma cell lines from poor into good targets for NK cells. IFN-gamma was used to restore the class I HLA expression of the c-myc transfectants, and the resulting cells showed a decreased NK susceptibility. These results suggest the possibility that the c-myc-induced NK susceptibility is mediated by the reduction of class I HLA expression.\r"

Similar C3 alterations were obtained after reaction between native C3 in serum from healthy persons or purified C3 nucleophiles that induce cleavage of the single thioester bond in the alpha chain of C3. This C3 alteration was unchanged when the reaction occurred in the presence of protease inhibitors. The electrophoretically slow C3 fraction was labile in serum on further proteolytic cleavage of C3. It is suggested that accelerated nonproteolytic C3 cleavage in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis facilitates subsequent binding of C3 to C3b receptors and targets of complement attack.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to localize and determine the relative importance of potential biochemical defects in the release and metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) in alveolar macrophages (AMs) from asymptomatic smokers. Using high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay, we compared the metabolism of both endogenously released and exogenously supplied AA in AMs and autologous peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) from nine healthy nonsmokers and eight healthy smokers. AMs from both groups incorporated similar amounts of radiolabeled AA into cellular lipids. However, AMs from smokers released only about half as much radioactivity as free AA and its metabolites in response to ionophore A23187, when compared to cells from nonsmokers; this suggests that net phospholipase activity was decreased in smokers. In addition, AMs from smokers synthesized less of total cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase products than did cells from nonsmokers, both constitutively and in response to A23187 as well as the particulate agonist zymosan. Furthermore the metabolism of exogenous AA to both cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase products was reduced in smoker cells compared to nonsmoker cells. Inverse relationships between eicosanoid synthesis and intensity of smoking were observed. No differences between smoker and nonsmoker PBMs were found. These results show that the major defect in smoker AMs is at the phospholipase level, with additional defects being present at the levels of the cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways. All these abnormalities are compartmentalized to the mononuclear phagocyte population of the lung.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence that guanine nucleotide-sensitive (G) proteins intervene in the activation of adenylate cyclase by parathyroid hormone (PTH). Furthermore, recent studies suggest that G proteins may be involved in the activation by PTH of phospholipase C, with subsequent elevation of diacylglycerol, inositol trisphosphate, and intracellular calcium. Since G proteins may be involved in both transduction systems postulated to mediate the actions of PTH, the present studies were performed to evaluate the influence of pertussis toxin, which prevents receptor-mediated activation of G proteins, on the effects of PTH in opossum kidney (OK) cells. In OK cell membranes, pertussis toxin catalyzed the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation of a protein with a molecular weight of 41 kd on SDS-PAGE. Cholera toxin catalyzed the ribosylation of two proteins of molecular weight 52 and 45 kd. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin abolished the labelling of this 41 kd protein, confirming the access of the toxin into the cells and the presence of pertussis toxin-sensitive substrates. The ribosylation of the cholera toxin substrates was unaffected by pertussis toxin pretreatment of the cells. Treatment of OK cells with pertussis toxin did not change the basal levels of cyclic AMP, but increased the levels of cyclic AMP in response to bPTH 1-34 from 355 +/- 17 to 449 +/- 20 pmoles cyclic AMP per 5 minutes per culture. These results were consistent with the inactivation of an inhibitory G protein. Furthermore, PTH-stimulated cyclic AMP generation was inhibited by norepinephrine from 362 +/- 10 to 228 +/- 18 pmole cyclic AMP per 5 minutes per culture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the functional importance of immunoglobulin polypeptide fragments generated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase (Pseudomonas elastase). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the elastase produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa cleaves human IgG into immune fragments that functionally inhibit opsonophagocytosis. Our results confirm that IgG isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) incubated with purified pseudomonas elastase results in the generation of two major polypeptide fragments and that, furthermore, these fragments significantly inhibit bacterial uptake by human neutrophils. After 75 minutes bacterial uptake was six times greater when intact IgG was used as an opsonin (uptake 90.2% +/- 18.6% SEM) compared with a IgG was used as an opsonin (uptake 90.2% +/- 18.6% SEM) compared with a mixture of pseudomonas-lipopolysaccharide-reactive Fab and F(ab')2 fragments generated by pseudomonas elastase (uptake 15.4% +/- 0.8% SEM, p less than 0.001). Hydrolyzed CF IgG antibodies consistently resulted in a level of bacterial uptake less than that of normal saline negative controls (NS): (at 10 minutes, NS 26.6% vs CF 16.8%, p less than 0.05; at 75 minutes, NS 28.2% vs CF 15.4%, p less than 0.01. This suggests that the immune polypeptides are active inhibitors of the essential neutrophil phagocyte-bacterial cell interaction. Intact immune IgG reversed the defect in opsonophagocytosis. When intact IgG was mixed with IgG fragments the phagocytic rates increased directly with increasing amounts of intact IgG. We conclude that the elastase exoproduct secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of cleaving IgG into functionally important fragments that inhibit bacterial uptake. Furthermore, this inhibition can be overcome by increasing amounts of a commercially available preparation of intact immune IgG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "L651582 (Merck Institute for Therapeutic Research, Rahway, NJ) is a novel carboxyamide-amino-imidazole compound originally developed as a coccidiostat (U.S. patent No. 4,590,201). We studied the inhibitory effects of this compound on cancer proliferation, adhesion, and motility in vitro and in vivo in a model of ovarian cancer progression. L651582 reversibly inhibited up to 60% of the autocrine motility factor-stimulated tumor cell motility and tumor cell adhesion to tissue culture plastic. Autocrine motility factor-stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism was reduced significantly by treatment of the cells with 3 microM L651582 (P = .022). Thymidine incorporation and clonogenic growth of A2058 human melanoma, MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer, OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer, and 5R-transformed rat embryo fibroblast cell lines were inhibited 60%-80% by 1-10 microM L651582. Intraperitoneal injection of OVCAR-3 cells causes malignant ascites, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and serosal and visceral seeding that, if left untreated, are lethal to nude mice. Intraperitoneal L651582 markedly prolonged survival of nude mice heavily laden with ovarian cancer [mean survival time of treated group divided by mean survival time of control group = 220% (P less than .03)]. The apparent mechanism of action of L651582 is via inhibition of the receptor-mediated stimulation of effector enzymes utilizing guanine nucleotide-binding protein signal transduction, which thus makes L651582 a novel anticancer agent. L651582 should be considered for further clinical development.\r"

  ".U": "90080193\r", 
  ".W": "In a survey carried out from 1985 through 1986, volunteer blood donors to The Greater New York Blood Program were tested for two surrogate markers for non-A, non-B hepatitis--elevation of alanine aminotransferase level and presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. Stored serum samples from selected donors were also recently tested for antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). Anti-HCV was detected in 0.9% to 1.4% of donors and was higher in black and Hispanic donors than in white donors. Anti-HCV prevalence increased with increasing age through the fourth decade of life, but decreased thereafter, possibly reflecting the disappearance of detectable antibody with time. Anti-HCV correlated with both alanine aminotransferase level and the presence or absence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. These associations suggest that donor screening for elevation of alanine aminotransferase level and presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen was, as expected, at least partially effective in preventing transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis. The detection of anti-HCV in donors who have neither an elevation of alanine aminotransferase level nor presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen suggests that donor screening for anti-HCV will further reduce the risk of transfusion-associated hepatitis.\r"

Single specimens from five control subjects who did not receive transfusions tested negative for anti-HCV. Of four control subjects who did not receive transfusions and who developed non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis after hospitalization, three remained anti-HCV negative; the fourth person with postoperative NANB hepatitis tested anti-HCV positive before the operation. Five transfusion recipients with posttransfusion hepatitis B virus infection remained seronegative; a sixth with NANB hepatitis as well as hepatitis B virus infection had seroconversion for anti-HCV. Five of nine transfusion recipients with NANB hepatitis had anti-HCV seroconversion. These results show that present anti-HCV testing demonstrates an etiologic basis for approximately half of the cases of transfusion-associated NANB hepatitis, particularly those that develop chronicity. Although cases of NANB hepatitis without seroconversion may be explained otherwise, they may be caused by another, presently unidentified, virus.\r"

For many cell types, this process requires expression of ion cotransport mechanisms as well as accumulation of osmotically-active organic compounds. Recent observations have indicated that the cellular mechanisms responsible for modulating hypertonic volume regulation are complex and appear to involve hormonal, biochemical and physico-chemical stimuli. Knowledge of the specific ion-transport mechanisms involved in the initial phase of VRI, the factors that control their expression, and the interrelationships between inorganic and organic solute accumulation will be required before an in depth understanding of hypertonic cell volume regulation in medullary nephron segments can be achieved.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities in the function of the central nervous system exist in chronic renal failure (CRF) and some of these derangements may be related to excess parathyroid hormone (PTH) which causes a rise in brain calcium. The latter may affect metabolism of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE) in brain synaptosomes. We measured NE content, uptake and release in brain synaptosomes of CRF rats and studied whether excess PTH affects these parameters. Synaptosomes from rats with 21 days of CRF compared to those from normal animals have higher calcium content (11.4 +/- 0.92 vs. 7.1 +/- 0.50 nmol/mg protein, P less than 0.01) and lower Na-K ATPase activity (6.5 +/- 0.81 vs. 11.4 +/- 0.76 mumol Pi/mg protein/hr, P less than 0.01). NE content (11.0 +/- 0.60 vs. 13.6 +/- 0.55 pmol/mg protein/hr, P less than 0.01), uptake (46 +/- 4.5 vs. 110 +/- 5.9 pmol/mg protein times 50 min, P less than 0.01) and release (2.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.47 pmol/mg protein times 10 min, P less than 0.01). Parathyroidectomy (PTX) in CRF rats kept normocalcemic reversed these abnormalities in brain synaptosomes; indeed calcium content, Na-K ATPase activity and NE content, uptake and release in synaptosomes from PTX-CRF rats were not different from those seen in normal rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The preglomerular endothelial synthesis of prostaglandin I2 and endothelium-derived relaxing factor seem to modulate autoregulatory control by the afferent arterioles and the release of renin by the juxtaglomerular apparatus. The release of renin is followed by an increase in angiotensin II in the renal interstitium, which is responsible for adjusting the vascular tone of the efferent arterioles and vasa recta and for stimulating proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium. Variations in medullary circulation induced by angiotensin II could alter medullary interstitial pressure and the medullary production of prostaglandins E2 and I2 and, ultimately, could modulate sodium reabsorption in the medullary thick ascending limbs and the collecting ducts.\r"

  ".W": "Understanding the sequence of events responsible for pressure-related natriuresis and their pathophysiologic alterations may be useful in distinguishing various types of essential hypertension of renal origin. The perturbation of a distal step in the sequence is likely to be reflected in a simple physiologic defect. For instance, pathophysiologic alterations in the medullary production of prostaglandin E2 might directly influence natriuresis and diuresis because of its modulatory effect on tubular reabsorption of sodium and water. Perturbation of more proximal steps in the sequence could influence all the distal events as well. For instance, prostaglandin I2 and endothelium-derived relaxing factor may be produced by the preglomerular vasculature in response to alterations in renal perfusion pressure and may modulate the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells. Thus, variations in the production of prostaglandin I2 or endothelium-derived relaxing factor may be reflected by various renal vascular, tubular, and systemic homeostatic events related to the renin-angiotensin system.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study of pregnant women infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in Brooklyn, New York, USA, 16 (29%) of 55 evaluable infants were infected with HIV-1. 9 infants had paediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 6 had less severe clinical manifestations of HIV-1 infection, and 1 was symptom-free but was seropositive for HIV-1 beyond 15 months of age. The 10 infants born at 37 weeks of gestation or earlier were at higher risk of HIV-1 infection than infants born at 38 weeks of gestation or later (60% vs 22%) but the median age at appearance of disease was approximately 5 months in both groups. The HIV-1 transmission rate was not associated with predelivery levels of maternal T cells, anti-p24, or neutralising antibodies but it was higher, among full-term infants, for those with mothers in the lowest third of the distribution of anti-gp120 levels (53%). On immunoblot, transmitting mothers lacked a gp120 band but not other bands. Protection was not associated with antibody to recombinant peptides from the hypervariable region of the major neutralising gp120 epitope, and the anti-gp120 endpoint dilution titre was similar in transmitting and non-transmitting mothers. Mothers of uninfected full-term infants appear to confer immunological protection against HIV-1 infection of their offspring by way of a high-affinity antibody to a gp120 epitope, whose specificity has importance for vaccine development and possibly perinatal immunotherapy.\r"

Results showed that oral temperature has little effect on auditory brainstem response latencies and amplitudes. Head size affects waves III, V, and the amplitude of wave V, but is not entirely responsible for the gender latency difference. By examining young women with normal monthly hormonal cycles, significant changes in the absolute latencies of wave V were observed. These changes were correlated with hormonal changes as measured from venous blood samples. It was concluded that the etiology of the gender difference is a combination of hormonal and head-size differences.\r"

This method is ideally suited for patients with advanced tumors of the head and neck because it requires neither endoscopy nor general anesthesia. Over the past 5 years, 55 patients with tumors of the head and neck have undergone this procedure. Eighty-one percent of the patients had advanced disease at initial presentation. One patient (1.8%) had a procedure-related death and another patient (1.8%) had a complication that required a laparotomy. Three patients (5.4%) had minor complications that required minimal medical attention. None of the patients required general anesthesia and an endoscopy was not required. Patient discomfort during the procedure was minimal.\r"

On the aphasia screening test, on which normal persons make an average of less than one error in verbal expression, the mountaineers made twice as many aphasic errors after ascent (1.03 +/- 1.10) as before (0.52 +/- 0.80; P less than 0.05). A higher ventilatory response to hypoxia correlated with a reduction in verbal learning (r = -0.88, P less than 0.05) and with poor long-term verbal memory (r = -0.99, P less than 0.01) after ascent. An increase in the number of aphasic errors on the aphasia screening test also correlated with a higher ventilatory response to hypoxia in both the simulated-ascent group (r = 0.94, P less than 0.01) and a subgroup of 11 mountaineers (r = 0.59, P less than 0.05). We conclude that persons with a more vigorous ventilatory response to hypoxia have more residual neurobehavioral impairment after returning to lower elevations. This finding may be explained by poorer oxygenation of the brain despite greater ventilation, perhaps because of a decrease in cerebral blood flow caused by hypocapnia that more than offsets the increase in arterial oxygen saturation.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary protein intake may be an important determinant of the rate of decline in renal function in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. We conducted a prospective, randomized study of the efficacy of protein restriction in slowing the rate of progression of renal impairment. The study lasted 18 months and included 64 patients with serum creatinine concentrations ranging from 350 to 1000 micromol per liter. The patients were randomly assigned to follow either a regular diet or an isocaloric protein-restricted diet (0.4 g of protein per kilogram of the body weight per day). Blood-pressure levels and the balance between calcium and phosphate were similar in the two groups. End-stage renal failure developed in 9 of the 33 patients (27 percent) who followed the regular diet during the study, as compared with 2 of the 31 patients (6 percent) who followed the protein-restricted diet (P less than 0.05). The mean (+/- SE) glomerular filtration rate, as measured by the clearance of 51Cr bound to EDTA, fell from 0.25 +/- 0.03 to 0.10 +/- 0.05 ml per second (P less than 0.01) in the group on the regular diet, whereas it fell from 0.23 +/- 0.04 to 0.20 +/- 0.05 ml per second (P not significant) in the group on the protein-restricted diet. We conclude that dietary protein restriction is effective in slowing the rate of progression of chronic renal failure.\r"

  ".U": "90081846\r", 
  ".W": "The p53 gene has been a constant source of fascination since its discovery nearly a decade ago. Originally considered to be an oncogene, several convergent lines of research have indicated that the wild-type gene product actually functions as a tumour suppressor gene. For example, expression of the neoplastic phenotype is inhibited, rather than promoted, when rat cells are transfected with the murine wild-type p53 gene together with mutant p53 genes and/or other oncogenes. Moreover, in human tumours, the short arm of chromosome 17 is often deleted. In colorectal cancers, the smallest common region of deletion is centred at 17p13.1; this region harbours the p53 gene, and in two tumours examined in detail, the remaining (non-deleted) p53 alleles were found to contain mutations. This result was provocative because allelic deletion coupled with mutation of the remaining allele is a theoretical hallmark of tumour-suppressor genes. In the present report, we have attempted to determine the generality of this observation; that is, whether tumours with allelic deletions of chromosome 17p contain mutant p53 genes in the allele that is retained. Our results suggest that (1) most tumours with such allelic deletions contain p53 point mutations resulting in amino-acid substitutions, (2) such mutations are not confined to tumours with allelic deletion, but also occur in at least some tumours that have retained both parental 17p alleles, and (3) p53 gene mutations are clustered in four 'hot-spots' which exactly coincide with the four most highly conserved regions of the gene. These results suggest that p53 mutations play a role in the development of many common human malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "The ZFY gene in the sex-determining region of the human Y chromosome encodes a protein with 13 zinc fingers, and may determine whether an embryo develops as a male or female. ZFX, a related gene on the human X chromosome, may also function in sex determination; it encodes a protein with a very similar zinc-finger domain and escapes X inactivation. ZFY and ZFX diverged from a common ancestral gene before the radiation of placental mammals, and retain a similar genomic organization. Analysis of complementary DNAs from the mouse Y-chromosomal homologues of ZFY indicates that these genes encode probable transcription activators. Here, we report that ZFX encodes a protein composed of a highly acidic amino-terminal domain, a basic putative nuclear-localization signal, and a carboxy-terminal zinc-finger domain. This combination of features, also found in the ZFY gene product, is typical of transcription activators. Alternative splicing generates ZFX transcripts encoding isoforms of 575 and 804 amino acids. These ZFX protein isoforms differ in the length of their acidic domains and may be functionally distinct.\r"

  ".U": "90081870\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors by neurotransmitter glutamate stimulates phospholipase A2 to release arachidonic acid. This second messenger facilitates long-term potentiation of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, possibly by blocking glutamate uptake. We have studied the effect of arachidonic acid on glutamate uptake into glial cells using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to monitor the uptake electrically. Micromolar levels of arachidonic acid inhibit glutamate uptake, mainly by reducing the maximum uptake rate with only small effects on the affinity for external glutamate and sodium. On removal of arachidonic acid a rapid (5 minutes) phase of partial recovery is followed by a maintained suppression of uptake lasting at least 20 minutes. Surprisingly, the action of arachidonic acid is unaffected by cyclo-oxygenase or lipoxygenase inhibitors suggesting that it inhibits uptake directly, possibly by increasing membrane fluidity. As blockade of phospholipase A2 prevents the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), inhibition of glutamate uptake by arachidonic acid may contribute to the increase of synaptic gain that occurs in LTP. During anoxia, release of arachidonic acid could severely compromise glutamate uptake and thus contribute to neuronal death.\r"

  ".W": "Site-specific recombination requires conserved DNA sequences specific to each system, and system-specific proteins that recognize specific DNA sequences. The site-specific recombinases seem to fall into at least two families, based on their protein structure and chemistry of strand breakage. One of these is the resolvase-invertase family, members of which seem to form a serine-phosphate linkage with DNA. Members of the other family, called the integrase family, contain a conserved tyrosine residue that forms a covalent linkage with the 3'-phosphate of DNA at the site of recombination. Structural comparison of integrases shows that these proteins share a highly conserved 40-residue motif. V-(D)-J recombination of the immunoglobulin gene requires conserved recombination signal sequences (RS) of a heptamer CACTGTG and a T-rich nonamer GGTTTTTGT, which are separated by a spacer sequence of either 12 or 23 bases We have recently purified, almost to homogeneity, a protein that specifically binds to the immunoglobulin J kappa RS containing the 23-base-pair spacer sequence. By synthesizing probes on the basis of partial amino-acid sequences of the purified protein, we have now isolated and characterized the complementary DNA of this protein. The amino-acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence reveals that the J kappa RS-binding protein has a sequence similar to the 40-residue motif of integrases of phages, bacteria and yeast, indicating that this protein could be involved in V-(D)-J recombination as a recombinase.\r"

Segments representing the facial nerve, internal carotid artery, and inner ear structures from individual slides were traced and data were entered into a computer. A personal computer was used for data processing and analysis. Graphic software developed in our laboratory generated images with x-y-z coordinates that could be rotated in any plane. The high resolution of the computer graphics system, combined with the precision of histologic sections, permitted study of the critical three-dimensional anatomic relationships among essential intratemporal bone structures. The capability of reproducing individual and joint images of the intratemporal bone structures and viewing them from all surgical angles gives skull base and otologic surgeons important topographic guidance. Accurate spatial measurements of temporal bone anatomy are now possible with the application of computer graphic technology.\r"

Antiprogesterone receptor monoclonal antibodies revealed a distinct band at approximately 120 kilodaltons in samples taken from two of four patients with HN-SCC. These results illustrate that progesterone receptor in HN-SCC has the same molecular weight as progesterone receptor in normal human uterus and human breast cancer. Steroid specificity and saturability results support the evidence that it is true progesterone receptors that are measured and not other receptors or sex steroid-binding globulins; (2) to confirm the biochemical function of progesterone receptors in HN-SCC by assessing the binding of progesterone receptor to acceptor sites on chromosomes in the nucleus; and (3) to establish the clinical significance of progesterone receptor measurement. Patients with positive assays were more likely to be free of disease a mean of 6 months after resection. We used logistic regression to account for site of primary disease, grade of tumor, and stage of disease. This logistic regression was significant with a p = 0.014. Patients with a binding index greater than 2 (19 of 73 patients) were 4.34 times more likely to be free of disease than patients with negative assays.\r"

The other half were controls and received equal intramuscular injections of saline. Auditory brainstem responses were obtained from all animals before and after 8 weeks of treatment of diet and drugs to examine the effects of treatment upon hearing and auditory brainstem function. A three-way analysis of variance of dietary magnesium, by drug and by sex, showed no significant differences in auditory brainstem wave V thresholds, wave V latencies, or interpeak wave I-V latencies between the control and experimental groups. The low magnesium diet group, which received drugs, had significantly greater wave V auditory brainstem response amplitudes. Results can be explained on the basis of magnesium influencing the uptake of calcium into both the hair cells and associated brainstem pathways.\r"

However, the effects of hyperthermia on the response to these interferons have not been elucidated fully. In this study, a cell line derived from a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (JHU-011-SCC-L-P) was grown in the presence of recombinant human interferon alpha (rHuIFN alpha) or recombinant human interferon gamma (rHuIFN gamma) and incubated at either 37 degrees or 39 degrees C, and cell growth rates were measured. Cells incubated with rHuIFN alpha demonstrated no difference in growth rates from control cells. Cells treated with rHuIFN gamma showed significant inhibition of growth at both temperatures, and the ratio of decreased growth at 39 degrees C was significantly greater than for the rHuIFN alpha and control groups. This hyperthermic effect did not depend on the continued exposure to rHuIFN gamma, and the effect appeared to depend on the duration of hyperthermia instead of the time sequence of hyperthermic exposure. Moreover, initial treatment at 39 degrees C for 24 hours was ineffective in producing the hyperthermic response produced with continuous hyperthermic exposure. These findings would indicate that the effect of rHuIFN gamma on this laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell line is enhanced significantly at 39 degrees C compared with 37 degrees C. There appears to be no similar hyperthermia-augmented antiproliferative effect of rHuIFN alpha-treated cells.\r"

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies (PEGs) and jejunostomies (PEJs) can facilitate enteral feeding in patients who require this treatment. The endoscopic technique allows for the placement of feeding gastrostomies and jejunostomies without a surgical procedure and eliminates the need for nasal tubes for long-term enteral feeding. Forty-two patients with head and neck tumors were referred for placement of PEGs because of severe dysphagia induced by tumors, surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. The procedure was performed in the gastroenterology suite. Patients were sedated with intravenous meperidine and diazepam, and local anesthetic with lidocaine was applied to the area of incision. Average procedure time was approximately 20 minutes. The procedure was successful in 39 patients in whom tubes were placed ranging in diameter from 15F to 22F. PEGs were placed in 36 patients with intact stomachs and PEJs in three patients with previous gastrectomies. The remaining three procedures were unsuccessful because of technical reasons. There were three localized skin infections, and all responded to antibiotic therapy. Neither peritonitis nor any other immediate complication occurred. In 16 nonhospitalized patients, the procedure was performed on an outpatient basis. After a mean followup of 4.5 +/- 6 months of enteral feeding in the home, there was only one case of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia, and this case responded to antibiotics. No other long-term complications were noted. Thus feeding gastrostomies and jejunostomies can be placed safely and easily in patients with cancers of the head and neck by endoscopic methods without abdominal surgery. These tubes can be used for enteral feeding and eliminate the need for nasogastric tubes. They are better tolerated, are of a wider diameter, and have a reduced risk for migration, clogging, and aspiration-related complications.\r"

From 1967 to 1987, 16 patients underwent repair of chronic cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea in the cribriform plate or fovea ethmoidalis at the University of Iowa with an osteomucoperiosteal flap. Follow-up data from 1.6 to 22 years demonstrated no recurrent leaks in this group of patients. Minimal morbidity and no deaths were associated with the osteomucoperiosteal flap. On the basis of our experience, we recommend this technique, which can be performed by any experienced paranasal sinus surgeon, as superior to craniotomy for the repair of chronic cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea from cribriform plate and fovea ethmoidalis defects.\r"

The present study investigates the value of deferoxamine in ischemic flap surgery in the porcine model. Four 4 x 12 cm flaps, 3 cm apart and 3 cm from the dorsal midline, were elevated on each of six female pigs, weighing 50 to 60 pounds each. The animals were divided into two test groups. Group 1 received six 1 gm doses of deferoxamine in 4 ml of sterile water intramuscularly every 6 hours preoperatively for five doses, followed by the administration of 1 g every 6 hours for the first 6 days postoperatively. Group 2 received 4 ml of normal saline administered intramuscularly as above. The percentage of flap necrosis was assessed on postoperative day 7 by the weighing paper technique. Group 1 had 17.1% necrosis and group 2 had 33% necrosis (p less than 0.005). Deferoxamine has decreased flap necrosis in the porcine model and may be of use in augmenting the surviving length of flaps in human beings.\r"

To evaluate our experience in light of this suggested incidence, we conducted a retrospective study, which included 22 patients treated over an 8-year period, 1979 to 1987. Patients' ages ranged from 16 months to 19 years, and all patients presented with an unknown, solid parotid mass. One patient had a malignancy, mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Eight patients were diagnosed with benign pleomorphic adenoma. Thirteen patients had an inflammatory process consisting of one of the following conditions: cat-scratch disease (4); atypical mycobacteria (4); benign follicular hyperplasia of a lymph node (4); and toxoplasmosis (1). The histologic findings in this series suggest that unknown solid parotid masses that occur in children or adolescents are frequently the result of inflammatory conditions and are not likely to be malignant. We therefore recommend a reconsideration of the reputed estimation of malignancy in the parotid gland in children. The majority of pathologic conditions discovered, however, are still best diagnosed and treated by surgical excision.\r"

  ".W": "When a striated muscle becomes paralyzed, not only its motor function, but its sensory innervation may be impaired. Methods of rehabilitation have previously focused only on motor innervation, although striated muscles are submitted to self-regulation of length and tension. Indeed, reinnervated muscle may not contract appropriately unless sensory information is available, nor is it known whether sensory receptors are included in the reinnervation process. We hypothesized that the myotatic reflex (MR) would be absent in the event these sensory organs are not reinnervated, and that an artificial myotatic reflex (AMR) would be useful in reestablishing fine motor control. The strap muscles were exposed in six anesthetized rabbits. The MR was verified by stretching an intact sternohyoid muscle. Next, loss of the reflex was documented after the ipsilateral ansa hypoglossi was divided, and a crossover nerve-muscle pedicle (NMP) was brought in from the opposite sternothyroid. After 3 months, the MR was still absent; however, stretch of the contralateral sternohyoid produced a reflex response on the reinnervated side. A strain gauge sutured to the reinnervated muscle was linked to an electronic modulator so that stretch induced electric stimulation of the NMP and contraction (the AMR). We conclude that (1) proprioception is not reestablished in the reinnervated muscle; (2) by contrast, sensory information from the muscle of origin of the NMP is conveyed to the reinnervated side; and (3) the AMR offers promise toward more sophisticated control of paralyzed (i.e., facial, laryngeal) musculature.\r"

From January 1980 until December 1987, 18 patients with advanced parotid malignancies underwent stylohamular dissection. Pathologic examination revealed the following diagnosis: adenocarcinoma (7), squamous cell carcinoma (5), high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (2), metastatic adenocarcinoma (1), fibrosarcoma (1), malignant hemangiopericytoma (1), and melanoma (1). Nine patients in this series are alive after a mean follow-up period of 3.5 years (range 1 to 9 years). Three patients are dead of uncontrolled local disease and three of distant metastasis. Three patients died of unrelated causes. All patients except the three who had uncontrolled disease experienced marked palliation from their pain, trismus, and unmanageable ulcerative lesions after surgery.

Twelve patients with nasal polyps were evaluated by history, physical examination, skin testing, nasal smear for eosinophils, specific IgE determination from serum, nasal secretions, and nasal polyp fluid. Similar data were collected from three control groups: (1) 10 patients with allergic rhinitis, (2) 10 patients with nonallergic rhinitis, and (3) 10 patients with no known nasal disease. By comparing the incidence of markers for allergic disease in patients with nasal polyposis to each of the three control groups, the role of allergic disease in nasal polyposis was delineated.\r"

The effects of lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall component of gram-positive bacteria, on the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes were studied. Various concentrations of lipoteichoic acid (0 to 100 micrograms/ml) were added to keratinocytes. DNA synthesis and protein synthesis were inhibited by decreasing the incorporation of 3H-thymidine and 3H-leucine into keratinocytes. The effects of lipoteichoic acid on terminal differentiation were then studied by measuring the number of sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble cornified cell envelopes and the transglutaminase activity (a marker of terminal differentiation) determined by incorporation of 3H-putrescine into cornified envelopes. These studies showed that lipoteichoic acid stimulated the formation of cornified cell envelopes and transglutaminase activity. These findings suggest that lipoteichoic acid stimulated the terminal differentiation and accumulation of keratin debris and that lipoteichoic acid might have stimulatory effects on the development of cholesteatoma.\r"

  ".W": "To further test the feasibility of a central nervous system auditory prosthesis, the characteristics of the electrically evoked middle latency response were studied in a series of acutely anesthetized pigmented guinea pigs, with multi-channel penetrating cochlear nucleus electrodes placed into the cochlear nucleus under direct visualization. These stimulating electrodes consisted of a silicone substrate, with five stimulating pads each, sputtered with iridium. Monopolar and bipolar stimulation were used. Threshold, latency, and input-output functions of the electrically evoked middle latency response were studied. Systematic differences were observed, depending on the site and parameters of stimulation. Principally, higher currents were required to produce waves of equal amplitude when the electrodes were closely spaced. For near electrode pairs, the maximum wave amplitudies obtainable within the limits of tissue safety were much lower than for distant electrode pairs. The slope of the growth function curve was steeper for widely spaced electrodes than for adjacent sites. Monopolar stimulation demonstrated maximum wave amplitudes with the lowest current intensity, implying current spread to the entire cochlear nucleus with this stimulation montage. In some cases, threshold differences were observed, higher thresholds being associated with closely spaced electrodes. These findings are consistent with simple models of the electric fields expected to be generated by these electrode arrays. The results support the hypothesis that activation of subpopulations of auditory brainstem neurons with multi-channel penetrating microelectrodes is possible.\r"

With nerve bundles approaching the epithelium, the axons divided repeatedly and entered the epithelial layer. In the epithelial cells, nerve axons formed knob-like swellings that contained a small number of large granular vesicles and a large number of small agranular vesicles. A sensory function responsive to irritant chemical stimuli and to mechanical stimuli is presumed for these vesicle-containing nerve processes.\r"

Two of these patients, who had recurrent disease involving the cavernous sinus, underwent repeat, extended resections. Seventeen of the tumors were esthesioneuroblastomas. Only one patient had received no treatment before surgery. The complications of this surgical technique are reviewed. The most significant complications were neurologic problems and infection. Additional issues, such as the handling of the eye, lacrimal sac, and medial canthal ligament, are also reviewed.\r"

Kanamycin and ethacrynic acid administration in guinea pigs resulted in graded amounts of eighth nerve degeneration over time. The electrically-induced middle latency response (EMLR) was acutely recorded in these animals at specific post-drug times, followed by the immediate killing of the animals, histologic preparation, and spiral ganglion cell density determination. Significant progressive spiral ganglion cell loss was noted by 4 weeks that increased over time. While EMLR threshold remained stable over time, the slope of the EMLR input/output function decreased with increasing post-drug intervals in a manner directly correlated with reduction in spiral ganglion cell density.\r"

No adverse effects were detected. Mean pharmacokinetic values for the large, intermediate and small dose groups, respectively, were: elimination half-life, 19.6, 28.7 and 22.1 days; clearance, 5.2, 5.6 and 3.7 ml/kg/day; volume of distribution, 151, 255 and 130 ml/kg. Mean peak IgG concentrations in serum were 1826, 1476 and 1257 mg/dl for the large, intermediate and small dose groups, respectively. Mean IgG on post-infusion Days 1 to 28 were similar for the intermediate and small dose groups but were higher in the larger dose group. Both large and intermediate doses achieved larger increases in IgG over preinfusion values (delta IgG) than the small dose. The differences in delta IgG between the large and intermediate doses were less notable. The wide variability observed indicates that individualization of intravenous immunoglobulin dosage will be required in these patients.\r"

The infection was mainly asymptomatic and usually associated with prolonged carriage of the parasite. There were no significant differences for height and weight achievements and mean hemoglobin values between Giardia-positive and Giardia-negative children. However, Giardia-positive children tended to achieve higher weight and height for age than Giardia-negative children; weight for age was above the 50th percentile in 69% of Giardia-positive vs. 40% of Giardia-negative children (alpha = 0.01). Giardia-positive children tended to have fewer symptoms related to the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts as recorded by a weekly questionnaire. Lactase deficiency was detected by breath hydrogen testing in 8 of 26 Giardia-positive vs. only 1 of 21 Giardia-negative children (P less than 0.02). Healthy day care children with asymptomatic Giardia infection show no disadvantage and perhaps even an advantage in nutritional status and freedom from other illnesses.\r"

As a first step toward this remote goal we designed a procedure allowing in vitro cell targeting by retroviruses. Biotinylated antibodies against the viral envelope protein on one side, and against specific cell membrane markers on the other side, were bridged by streptavidin and used to link the virus to the host. The method was successfully used to infect human cells with ecotropic murine retroviruses by means of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II antigens and appears easily adaptable to other cell membrane markers. Moreover, the sequential protocol we designed, although allowing infection of human cells, requires less stringent safety constraints than would handling of amphotropic virus stocks.\r"

  ".W": "The construction of allele-specific suppressor mutations has enabled us to demonstrate that a sporulation-specific transcription unit in Bacillus subtilis, the spoIIG operon, is transcribed by a form of RNA polymerase associated with sigma A, the principal sigma factor in vegetative cells. The spoIIG operon encodes sporulation-specific factor sigma E, and its transcription is directed from a promoter that is activated about 1 hr after the onset of endospore formation. This promoter contains sequences that are similar to those found at the -10 and -35 regions of promoters that are used by sigma A-associated RNA polymerase, but these sigma A-like recognition sequences are separated by 22 base pairs rather than the typical 17 or 18 base pairs. We have found that substitution of an arginyl residue for the glutamyl residue at position 196 of sigma A (Glu-196----Arg) suppresses the deleterious effect of a thymidine-to-cytidine base substitution at position -11 in the spoIIG promoter. This suppression was allele-specific, since it did not suppress the effects of base substitutions in other positions in the spoIIG promoter or the effects of a thymidine-to-guanosine change at -11. These results support a model in which a form of RNA polymerase containing sigma A is utilized in an unusual manner to activate the transcription of the spoIIG operon well after the onset of endospore formation.\r"

Separation and further purification were by different types of chromatography. Sequence analysis showed the anti-Bm factor to be apparently similar to vasoactive intestinal peptide. The anti-Ec factor was found to have a 31-residue sequence that was cecropin-like. It was named cecropin P1 and its structure was confirmed by solid-phase synthesis. Synthetic cecropin P1 with and without C-terminal amide was assayed on eight different bacteria. Mobility comparison between synthetic and natural cecropin P1 indicates that the natural peptide has a free C-terminal carboxyl group.\r"
