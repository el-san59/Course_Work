All had an examination under general anesthesia followed by arthroscopy. Anatomical lesions were demonstrated in 71 of 80 knees (89%) including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) disruption in 50 (62%). Twenty-nine of 50 patients (58%) with arthroscopically-demonstrated ACL injuries had associated meniscal tears. Fifteen (19%) demonstrated isolated meniscal tears and nine (11%) osteochondral fractures not detected by conventional roentgenograms. The frequent occurrence of injuries to other joint structures in conjunction with ACL injuries was remarkable. An acute traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee often masks significant lesions. Arthroscopy aids the orthopedic surgeon in determining the full extent of the intraarticular damage.\r"

The radiodensity of glass is dependent on its varying quantities of iron, silicon, dioxide, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, and sodium salts. The awareness that the radiodensity of glass can be similar to that of human bone on roentgenogram can help the surgeon avoid the pitfall of misdiagnosis. Roentgenograms may be used to detect intraarticular glass and to assist in a localization of glass imbedded in the soft tissue.\r"

Clinical histories and serial roentgenograms were used in conjunction with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard implant retrieval and analysis techniques to assess device performance. All of the devices were removed because of implant loosening with pain, while two devices also had a late infection. The average time in situ for all devices was four years. Roentgenographically, all of the devices showed signs of progressive radiolucencies. Ten (83%) of the devices migrated proximally within the femur. A marked varus drift was observed in eight (67%) of the retrieved prostheses. Hypertrophy of the femoral cortex was observed in eight (67%) of the cases. Seventy-three percent of the polyethylene tibial stems exhibited extensive wear on the anterior and medial aspects of the articulating surface. Extensive wear was also seen on the anterior and extreme posterior aspects in 92% of the polyethylene tibial plateau bearings. This wear was a consequence of the migration of the femoral component leading to buttressing of the plastic components against bone or bone cement. This study indicates serious design flaws in the Noiles knee prosthesis that unless corrected would question the use of the device in either primary or revision knee surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Internal and external torque generated about the long axis of the lower extremity was measured in 18 male subjects who were instructed to twist with maximal effort against a fixed footplate containing an instrumented torque cell. Mean torque values ranged from 30 to 71 newton meters (Nm) depending upon the test conditions. Torques recorded during the flexed single-leg stance were 19% to 49% higher than those measured while seated. Values at 45 degrees of knee flexion were 11% to 16% greater than those at 20 degrees. Torques generated while wearing a ski boot were 8% to 11% greater than those recorded in an athletic shoe. When movement of the pelvis and upper torso was allowed, torque values were 17% to 49% higher than those recorded when the hips and shoulders were restrained which allowed only lower leg musculature to act in an isolated fashion. There were no differences between internal versus external generated torques when the hips and torso were restrained. When the hips and shoulders were unrestrained, internal torque was 12% greater than external torque. There were no strong correlations between generated torque and body weight or height. These generated torque values suggest that if ski bindings are set to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards for twist-release torque, then upper torso and pelvic movement in conjunction with tensed knee musculature (i.e., a \"locked knee\") may be necessary to accomplish binding release. Use of the lower leg musculature alone (i.e., ankle twist) may not generate sufficient torque for release.\r"

The dislocation of the radial head was lateral in 50% of the cases, posterolateral in 28.2%, anterolateral in 17.4%, and anterior in 4.3%. Thorough clinical and radiological examinations are essential. Simple bending of the upper end of the ulna may help to avoid missing an associated subluxation or dislocation of the radial head. The lower end of the forearm bones should be included in the roentgenographic examination; in 11 out of 46 children (26%) the dislocation of the elbow was associated with a fracture of the lower end of the ipsilateral radius and ulna. Closed reduction is the treatment of choice but if this fails, operative treatment should follow without delay.

All but one of these patients had radicular symptoms. The average age was 55 years, and the average follow-up time was eight months. All patients were injected by the same anesthesiologist with 2 cc of Depomedrol-40. Thirty-six patients received either one, two, or three injections. Four patients received either four or five injections. The overall results were poor, with about 60% of patients reporting varying degrees of relief from leg and back pain immediately after injection. However, at follow-up examination, only 24% were asymptomatic; 40% reported no change in preinjection numbness, weakness, or pain; and approximately 35% had varying degrees of relief with no consistent pattern. Of those who had complete relief, there was no correlation between relief of pain, age, or number of injections. From this study, it appears that approximately 50% of patients with radicular symptoms may receive temporary relief with steroid injection. However, long-term relief occurs in less than 25% of patients.\r"

However, little can be found in the orthopedic literature. Of the peripheral nerve groups, the brachial plexus may be the most vulnerable to injury from malpositioning. This study presents three such cases of brachial plexus injury and reviews the literature concerning the subject. Pertinent anatomy, etiology, and pathogenesis of injury to the brachial plexus reveal that injury can occur from stretch or compression of nerves and is usually caused by a combination of the two. With awareness of risk factors and the positions which are likely to cause injury to the brachial plexus, careful positioning of the upper extremity can prevent injury and potential disability to the patient.\r"

The most important independent risk factor for later development of coxa magna was radiographic widening of medial joint space with 1 mm or more at admission, which was seen in 42.1% and the presence of which gave a sensitivity of 0.74 and a specificity of 0.73 for coxa magna. At the one-year follow-up examination, the joint space was still wide in 10.1% of the children. The high frequency of coxa magna in these patients and its possible role in the development of degenerative arthritis indicate that transient synovitis of the hip should not be considered a harmless disease until further epidemiologic studies are available.\r"

In the control non-rheumatoid group, six of 27 undisplaced fractures and 34 of 67 displaced fractures developed complications. In displaced fractures, complications occurred more often in rheumatoid patients (p less than 0.0004).

Although dislocation and component disassembly have been reported as complications of the Bateman and other bipolar prostheses, fractures of the polyethylene bearing insert seems not to have been previously reported. The presumed mechanism of failure is cyclic loading of a femoral cup that is tipped into varus alignment. This concentrates stress on the weakest part of the polyethylene insert--the deep circumferential groove that joins the leaflets to the main body of the insert. Obesity and overuse were associated factors in this rare complication.\r"

Patients who are seen with complaints of low back pain need a thorough history and physical examination, with appropriate additional studies as indicated. Conservative therapy will usually prove successful. Current trends in therapy are toward shorter periods of inactivity, with more emphasis on education and rehabilitation, to include active reconditioning in an attempt to decrease the risk of reinjury. For individuals with chronic back pain, referral to a multidisciplinary chronic pain center may be necessary.\r"

There is a close association between these arrhythmias and the levels of these cations, with a high K level associated with an increased incidence of arrhythmias and a high Mg level being associated with a protective effect. Treatment with a continuous infusion of Mg is highly effective in the prevention of these arrhythmias resulting in a fall in inhospital mortality.\r"

A dramatic decrease in serum ACE activity was observed after each of the 51 PE procedures. Repeated PE procedures resulted in almost a total depletion of serum ACE, which returned to normal ranges in 4 to 10 days. No ACE change was observed during hemodialysis or hemofiltration. ACE activity increased after PE with fresh frozen plasma replacement. ACE changes were compared with IgG, antithrombin III, and fibronectin changes. Extraction ratio comparisons were consistent, with a loss in removed plasma accounting for 50% to 70% of the observed ACE decrease. Plasma zinc levels were not modified after PE. Mixing experiments with increasing volumes of plasma substitutes showed ACE inhibition by Polygelin. In vivo infusion of Polygelin had the same effect. The renin-induced aldosterone response studied in six exchanged patients was consistent with a relative hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism after repeated PE. These findings may be of clinical relevance during acute hypovolemia and dehydration after PE or Polygelin infusion and in patients with impaired lung endothelial function.\r"

Multiple pulmonary artery filling defects (PAFD) were detected in 13 (42%) patients, with a seven (78%) in nine incidence among those with posttraumatic ARDS. The presence of PAFD did not correlate with the severity of the respiratory failure, with the pulmonary hemodynamic alterations (pulmonary hypertension and increased vascular resistance), or with the final outcome (mortality rate was 54% among patients with PAFD and 61% among those with normal angiograms). These findings suggest that widespread pulmonary microthrombosis is a common event in patients with polytrauma and respiratory failure, with an important pathophysiologic role in the onset of posttraumatic ARDS.\r"

The two survivors were discharged from the hospital without visual or neurologic impairment. Hemorrhagic necrosis of the brain was found on CT scan and at autopsy in two patients who died. This complication of methanol intoxication prompted us to review our experience with this poison since 1980. Of 45 methanol intoxication patients treated in our ICU, CT scan was performed in 21, and brain hemorrhage was documented in six, thereby giving an incidence of at least six of 45 or 13.5%. Although hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic putamenal necrosis has been described from methanol poisoning previously, we postulate that heparinization during hemodialysis may contribute to brain hemorrhage complicating methanol poisoning and recommend the use of artificial kidneys with albumin-primed biocompatible membranes so that heparin administration during hemodialysis can be minimized.\r"

  ".U": "88136543\r", 
  ".W": "During CPR, the dynamics of the chest compression process play a major role in determining the outcome of the resuscitation effort. To quantify chest wall motion during CPR, a number of important variables must be determined, including maximum downward acceleration and velocity of the chest wall, time during which the wall is held in compression, and maximum depth and rate of chest compression. In this study, miniature accelerometers were used to record chest wall motion during simulated CPR with standard training manikins. One series of CPR tests included force measurements from a three-dimensional force platform placed under the manikin. The results of this investigation showed that American Heart Association (AHA)-certified rescuers are able to produce a consistent pattern of chest wall displacement during a manikin training exercise, and only small differences in displacement recordings are found when comparing one certified rescuer to another. Any given rescuer will usually generate a consistently repeatable acceleration pattern during CPR. However, these cyclical acceleration patterns differ markedly when comparing different certified rescuers. Mechanical CPR with a standard device produced larger peak accelerations than manual CPR. However, the maximum downward velocity was usually higher with manual CPR. In comparison with trained but clinically inexperienced individuals, rescuers with extensive in hospital experience produced relatively larger downward accelerations, longer \"hold\" times with the chest in compression, and maximum chest displacements that exceeded the current AHA recommendations. Measurements of the force transmitted through the manikin to a force platform clearly indicated the presence of a \"hold\" phase (if present) and the existence of large force components in the horizontal plane.\r"

Arterial plasma concentrations of dopamine were measured in 27 patients who were hemodynamically stable and received dopamine for at least one hour. The dopamine levels were measured using liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Dopamine clearance averaged 96.2 +/- 55.4 ml/kg.min in 13 patients in the neonatal ICU, and 58.8 +/- 51 ml/kg.min in 14 patients in the pediatric ICU. Six patients had renal (BUN greater than 25 mg/dl, or creatinine greater than 1.2 mg/dl) or hepatic (liver enzymes greater than 3 times normal) dysfunction. Dopamine clearance in these patients (25.1 +/- 17.2 ml/kg.min) was substantially lower than in the other patients (p less than .01). Neither postnatal nor gestational age correlated with dopamine clearance. Substantial interindividual variation was observed in steady-state dopamine clearance in critically ill infants and children, and plasma dopamine could not be predicted accurately from the dopamine infusion rate. Because of the more than three-fold prolongation of dopamine clearances in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction, these patients may be more likely to suffer toxic effects of dopamine at the usual drug infusion rates.\r"

All autopsies (n = 2,897), lung biopsies (n = 244), and medical records of children followed at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children (SCHC) between 1960 and 1985 were screened. Nineteen cases of OB were confirmed using radiologic and histologic criteria. Twelve patients were diagnosed during life, and ten survived. Seven were diagnosed post mortem. OB should be considered when persistent respiratory signs and symptoms follow acute pneumonia, aspiration is known or suspected, areas of hyperlucency are seen on chest radiograph, or respiratory failure with overaeration is unresponsive to therapy. Diagnostic studies include ventilation-perfusion scan, bronchography and lung biopsy. Sequelae include dyspnea on exertion, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis, persistent atelectasis, and hyperlucent lung syndrome. Recognition and supportive treatment during the acute and chronic phases may improve the functional status of these patients.\r"

We blended oxygen and hypoxic gas to achieve arterial oxygen saturations (SaO2) of 80, 85, and 90 percent; subjects also breathed 100 percent oxygen and room air (RA). Target SaO2 and end-tidal carbon dioxide were continuously monitored using an ear oximeter and CO2 gas analyzer. Subjects experienced the five SaO2 measurements in random order. CO was measured noninvasively at approximately two-minute intervals, using continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography. Mean cardiac output increased with increasing hypoxemia from 6.84 L/min at FIo2 1.0 to 8.44 L/min at SaO2 80 percent (p less than 0.0005); the increase was entirely due to increased heart rate. We concluded that cardiac output increases significantly in a dose-response manner in response to acute isocapnic hypoxemia in normal persons.\r"

  ".W": "Traditionally, patients with acute airflow obstruction are treated with bronchodilator aerosols delivered by continuous flow nebulizers. While bronchodilator administration with the metered dose inhaler (MDI) and reservoir or spacer attachment is as effective as administration with the nebulizer in most settings, the former has not been widely accepted for treatment of acute airway obstruction in the emergency room. We compared the efficacy of the continuous flow nebulizer to that of the MDI with InspirEase (reservoir spacer) in 75 patients (45 men and 30 women), ages 18-73 (chi 44 years) who presented to the emergency room with acute asthma and COPD. Subjects in each group (22 COPD and 53 asthma) were randomly assigned to treatment with three puffs of metaproterenol (0.65 mg/puff) via the MDI with InspirEase plus nebulizer with placebo, or placebo MDI with InspirEase plus nebulizer with 15 mg metaproterenol in double blind fashion. Either treatment was given three times at 30 min intervals. The FEV1 and dyspnea scores according to the Borg scale were measured at baseline, 30 min after the first treatment, and 30 min after the third. There was no significant outcome difference between the two treatments in either diagnostic group. There also was no significant outcome difference for patients with baseline FEV1 less than 0.9L. Serum theophylline levels, the need for concomitant therapy with corticosteroids, or additional emergency room therapy after the study, hospitalizations and treatment side effects did not differ between treatment groups. We conclude that there is no demonstrable advantage of a continuous flow nebulizer over an MDI with InspirEase for the treatment of acute airflow obstruction.\r"

Mean bias relative to the sum of oxy-, carboxy-, and methemoglobins ranged from -0.4 to -2.6 percent for the pulse oximeters and +1.8 to -4.2 percent for the conventional oximeters. Two pulse oximeters performed well at all saturations down to 65 percent, while the others showed either increasing or decreasing bias below 80 percent saturation. Precision was approximately 2 percent for all instruments except one conventional oximeter with a precision of 0.7 percent. In the clinically relevant range, the performance of the noninvasive pulse oximeters was similar to conventional oximeters using arterial samples.\r"

During transfer to the hospital, they received 3.9 +/- 0.5 L of colloid fluid and 4.1 +/- 0.6 L of autotransfused blood, without anticoagulation. Hemorrhagic blood was not coagulable, had a hematocrit of 20 +/- 4 percent, few platelets, and low fibrinogen levels. Five patients died from irreversible hemorrhagic shock. Thirteen patients were alive upon admission to the hospital, underwent emergency surgery, and were discharged alive. During autotransfusion, hematocrit decreased from 24 +/- 3 to 19 +/- 3 percent, and systolic arterial pressure increased from 78 +/- 11 to 88 +/- 12 mm Hg. Upon admission to the hospital, platelet count was 90,800 +/- 21,400/cu mm, prothrombin time 48 +/- 3 percent, partial thromboplastin time 197 +/- 18 percent, plasma free hemoglobin levels 21 +/- 7 mg/100 ml, and serum potassium levels 3.6 +/- 0.5 mmol/L. No serious complication could be related to autotransfusion considered to be crucial to patients' survival. The preliminary results of this study suggest that autotransfusion might be developed in the prehospital setting since it appears simple and safe, and represents the only hope of survival for patients with life-threatening hemothorax.\r"

Although patient rotation through various positions after instillation of TCN has been advocated empirically, it has not been shown scientifically to be necessary and is often uncomfortable for the patient and time-consuming for personnel. Five patients with symptomatic, malignant pleural effusions were studied during pleurodesis using radiolabelled TCN. Scintigraphic imaging was done immediately after TCN instillation prior to patient rotation. Patients were rotated through six positions and multiple images were obtained at 30 and 120 minutes. Tetracycline dispersed throughout the pleural space within seconds. Patient positioning had no effect on the intrapleural distribution of TCN in four of the five patients. In one patient with loculated hydropneumothorax and trapped lung, rotation minimally improved distribution of TCN to the apex. Rotation during pleurodesis does not appear to be necessary in patients with a relatively normal pleural space. However, patient rotation enhances distribution of TCN when the lung is separated substantially from the chest wall, as with trapped lung. Possibly, in this situation the properties of fluid mechanics and capillary action no longer apply.\r"

The pleural penetration of the drugs was very high (from 80.0 to 99.1 percent). By contrast, gentamicin and netilmicin were not detectable in empyema pus; in this exudate the mean peak level of amikacin was 5.7 +/- 2.2 mg/L, with the penetration of this drug being 31.0 percent. The concentrations of parenterally administered aminoglycosides are substantially lower in empyema pus than in sterile pleural fluid. The possibility of poor pleural penetration of some aminoglycosides, as well as the presence of local conditions in pleural empyema unfavorable to the bioactivity of these drugs, must be kept in mind when treating pleural infections.\r"

  ".W": "Chemical pleurodesis with tetracycline is frequently complicated by pleuritic chest pain. The most promising approach to control pain is to optimize the use of intrapleural lidocaine. While administering amounts of intrapleural lidocaine larger than commonly reported, we attempted to determine a safe and more effective dose, by using a subjective and objective assessment of pain, by measuring serum concentrations of lidocaine, and by observing patients for possible toxic effects of lidocaine. Chemical pleurodesis with tetracycline was performed on ten patients receiving an intrapleural dose of 200 mg of lidocaine (group 1) and on ten patients receiving a 250-mg dose (group 2). A significantly greater number of patients in group 2 were free of pain following pleurodesis (7/10 vs 1/10; p = 0.006). Of the 80 serum lidocaine levels obtained, only one value (6.1 micrograms/ml), in an asymptomatic patient in group 1, exceeded the therapeutic range (1.5 micrograms/ml to 5.5 micrograms/ml). One patient in group 2 experienced transient numbness of the right hand, a possible side effect of lidocaine. We conclude that to achieve optimum anesthesia during chemical pleurodesis with tetracycline, it is necessary to use doses of intrapleural lidocaine large than previously reported. Until the feasibility of a further escalation is demonstrated, 250 mg should be considered the standard dose.\r"

With this device, resistance was found to be reproducible over five consecutive days, and was sensitive to the increase in airway resistance induced by head and neck flexion. We also report on a comparison between this method and a commercially available device that works on the \"interruptor\" principle. There was no significant difference in either mean or variance of resistance between the two methods. The instrumentation required for the newly designed method is minimal, and its operation is simple. Furthermore, the measurement can be performed without invasive procedures during tidal breathing.\r"

Lidocaine concentrations in bronchial washings obtained \"early\" (991 +/- 505 micrograms/ml) compared with \"late\" (943 +/- 580 micrograms/ml) in the procedure did not differ (p = NS). High lidocaine concentrations sufficient to inhibit growth in culture of mycobacterial and fungal pathogens (greater than 5,000 micrograms/ml) occurred in one early and two late bronchial washings but no BAL specimens. No correlation between lidocaine dose and measured concentrations was noted in any specimen category; however, highest bronchial washing concentrations occurred with the use of greater than 250 mg of lidocaine. We conclude that BAL specimens are suitable for culturing pathogens that may be inhibited by lidocaine. Furthermore, collecting bronchial washings late in the procedure or limiting the lidocaine dosage do not reliably decrease measured lidocaine concentrations.\r"

Eighteen MAI patients were treated with three or four antituberculosis agents resulting in sputum conversion and clinical improvement in 12 (67 percent). Additionally, 11 out of 16 (69 percent) patients completing therapy or still undergoing therapy for persistent MAI disease, achieved sputum conversion and clinical improvement after prolonged therapy (3.6 +/- 0.5 years [SEM]). When M kansasii was identified as the etiologic agent, all patients were treated with four or fewer antituberculosis agents and 14 out of 16 patients (88 percent) achieved sputum conversion and clinical improvement throughout the follow-up period.

  ".W": "To evaluate available clinical methods (self ratings and questionnaire) for rating dyspnea, we (1) compared scores from the recently developed baseline dyspnea index (BDI) with the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale and the oxygen-cost diagram (OCD) in 153 patients with various respiratory diseases who sought medical care for shortness of breath; and (2) evaluated the relationships between dyspnea scores and standard measures of physiologic lung function in the same patients. The dyspnea scores were all significantly correlated (r = 0.48 to 0.70; p less than 0.001). Agreement between two observers or with repeated use was satisfactory with all three clinical rating methods. The BDI showed the highest correlations with physiologic measurements. Dyspnea scores were most highly related to spirometric values (r = 0.78; p less than 0.001) for patients with asthma, maximal respiratory pressures (r = 0.34 and 0.35; p less than 0.001) for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and PImax (r = 0.51; p = 0.01) and FVC (r = 0.44; p = 0.03) for those with interstitial lung disease. These results show that: (1) the BDI, MRC scale, and OCD provide significantly related measures of dyspnea; (2) the clinical ratings of dyspnea correlate significantly with physiologic parameters of lung function; and (3) breathlessness may be related to the pathophysiology of the specific respiratory disease. The clinical rating of dyspnea may provide quantitative information complementary to measurements of lung function.\r"

The magnitude and duration of ST elevation during ischemic attacks were significantly greater in patients with than in those without ST alternans. It always appeared during the occlusion phase and disappeared during the reperfusion phase of ischemic attacks. In patients with episodic ST alternans, the ischemic attacks showed a greater ST elevation and a longer duration in the presence of ST alternans than in its absence. The incidence of occlusion phase ventricular arrhythmias was greater in patients with than in those without ST alternans; the incidence of reperfusion phase ventricular arrhythmias was similar in the two groups. The ST alternans always preceded the onset of occlusion phase arrhythmias. Thus, in variant angina, ST alternans represents an index of the severity of ischemia and a precursor of ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Results were correlated with clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. Clinical examination and chest x-ray films showed no evidence of acute cardiac or pulmonary pathology. Five patients had evidence of ventricular dysfunction by radionuclide ventriculography along with significant ECG abnormalities. Three patients had abnormal ECG findings with normal ejection fractions. Echocardiography showed no evidence of significant valvulopathy or pericardial disease except for one patient with fibrinous strands associated with the pericardium. Decreased ejection fractions did not correlate with disease classification, risk group or survival. This study suggests that a major percentage of AIDS patients have some evidence of cardiac abnormalities. We conclude that abnormal ECG findings in an AIDS patient should alert the clinician to possible underlying ventricular dysfunction.\r"

It is concluded that CT may be of use in the routine evaluation of pulmonary nodules, prior to bronchoscopy, especially in cases for which histologic evaluation is essential, especially to determine the presence or absence of a CT bronchus sign.\r"

In these circumstances, mechanical assistance to the Fontan circulation should be considered.

The hemodynamic improvement and weaning from IABP were successfully achieved in all cases. One patient survived the serious postoperative course with the aid of IAPB, and two patients died following multiorgan failure, though the circulation had eventually been re-established. By studying the postoperative hemodynamics assisted by IABP, it is concluded that IABP is a reasonable, efficacious strategy to support and to re-establish the failing Fontan circulation, though the changes in hemodynamic variables will not immediately coincide with IABP application.\r"

The increase is more dramatic in the older age groups, but younger age groups are not spared. The exact cause or causes of this increased mortality are not known, and it is even possible (although not likely) that the increase is artifactual. This increased death rate is in sharp contrast to the general medical perception that major advances in the management of bronchial asthma have occurred. Perhaps they have, but if so, more patients are dying during this period of advances than were dying before. The most prudent course would be to assume that the excess deaths are iatrogenic in origin and to act accordingly. Even if this assumption is flawed, acting on it would improve the management of patients with bronchial asthma. If it is true that the major purpose of risk-benefit analysis is to improve patient outcome rather than merely analyze risk-benefit balance, then a series of proposals can be generated to grapple with this problem in bronchial asthma.\r"

The patient was a grinder of tungsten-carbide drill bits who developed pneumonitis and subsequent fibrosis. Her therapy required steroids and cyclophosphamide for stabilization of her pulmonary function prior to her pregnancy. At six months' gestation, right heart catheterization showed normal cardiac output and pulmonary arterial and wedge pressures. Stage 2 exercise study demonstrated a maximum oxygen consumption of 1.17 L/min (53 percent of predicted). The patient was able to exercise to a maximum workload of 300 kpm/min (32 percent of predicted). She became hypoxemic (arterial oxygen pressure, 54 mm Hg) at 150 kpm/min. Her pregnancy concluded with an uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery requiring only supplemental oxygen and spinal anesthesia. Review of the few similar cases suggests that a woman can have a successful pregnancy despite severe pulmonary dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "We suggest that hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in the newborn calf is an attractive model for studying the mechanisms underlying alterations in extracellular matrix accumulation which occur in pulmonary vascular disease. Our data support a model (Fig 7) in which the SMC, perhaps as a result of hypoxic and/or pressure-induced vessel wall injury, becomes phenotypically altered. This phenotypically altered SMC generates a factor, termed smooth muscle derived extracellular matrix factor (SMEF), and possibly other factors. SMEF, in turn, stimulates or induces elastin and collagen synthesis in fibroblasts and endothelial cells. SMEF, or an associated activity derived from phenotypically altered smooth muscle cells, also induces elastin receptor expression on the cell surface and affects the chemotactic responsiveness of vascular cells. Thus, the SMC may be able to affect both the secretory and responsive properties of cell types in the vascular wall. The SMC may be critical in the vascular remodeling in pulmonary hypertension. The possible autocrine or paracrine alteration of cellular phenotypes by smooth muscle-derived mediators provides an important new direction for future research into molecular and cellular mechanisms of connective tissue regulation in diseased vessels.\r"

Our study aim was to evaluate the interrelationship between reduction of LES pressure and elevation of intraabdominal pressure in the induction of GER in healthy subjects. Seven volunteers were studied supine after gastric loading with 0.1 N HCl. A pH probe recorded acid GER. Leg raising (LR) or abdominal compression (AC) were used as stress maneuvers to increase intraabdominal pressure, either alone or in combination with stimuli that concurrently lowered LES pressure, namely multiple rapid swallows (RS) or intraesophageal balloon distention (BD). Each individual stimulus and stimulus combination was tested three times, giving a total of 24 test maneuvers per subject. The test maneuvers elicited 2-12 GERs in each subject. The GER incidence for single maneuvers was: AC, 0%; LR, 0%; RS, 19%; and BD, 24%. LR in combination with RS or BD did not increase the incidence of GER above that induced by RS or BD alone. In contrast, AC concurrent with RS and BD increased the incidence of GER to 52% and 81%, respectively. For all test conditions, a prerequisite for the occurrence of GER was a fall in LES pressure to a minimal value of 3 mm Hg or less. GER never occurred when LES pressure was greater than or equal to 4 mm Hg, even during intervals of increased intraabdominal pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with impairment of pancreatic function were subdivided into those with moderate and severe insufficiency. Plasma CCK and PP were measured by radioimmunoassay. Fasting plasma CCK in patients with pancreatic insufficiency (5.8 +/- 1.1 pmol/liter) did not differ significantly from controls (4.2 +/- 0.6 pmol/liter). After endogenous stimulation with a Lundh meal, plasma CCK increased in both groups without significant differences over 2 hr. Basal and stimulated plasma levels of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were markedly decreased only in patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency. Our results demonstrate that basal and meal-stimulated CCK levels in patients with pancreatic insufficiency do not differ from controls. Furthermore the extent of functional impairment of the exocrine pancreas did not influence basal and postprandial CCK release.\r"

However, the relationship between intragastric bile and gastric emptying has not been explored. In each of nine healthy volunteers (seven men and two women, ages 22-47 years), gastric emptying of 300 ml 10% dextrose labeled with [99mTc]DTPA was measured twice using gamma camera imaging. During one study, 20 min after ingestion of the test meal, 525 mg of freeze-dried, sterilized human T-tube bile dissolved in 20 ml water was introduced into the stomach via a previously sited fine-bore nasogastric tube. Intragastric bile salt concentrations were calculated to be within the range 1.7-2.9 mM. In control studies, 20 ml of water alone was similarly introduced. Emptying at 20 min was comparable for both groups of studies (38 +/- 3% vs 39 +/- 4%; mean values +/- SEM). For each individual study, emptying from 20 to 60 min was well represented by a single exponential function (r = 0.81-0.99). Half-emptying times for curves fitted over this period were similar in the two groups (bile: T1/2 = 18.8 +/- 2.6 min; control T1/2 = 18.8 +/- 1.9 min). These results indicate that intragastric bile, in concentrations similar to those found in patients with gastric ulcer, has no effect on gastric emptying of dextrose in normal subjects.\r"

Breath hydrogen and blood glucose lactose tests were performed after ingestion of 50 g lactose. Presenting complaints, duration of symptoms, and patient demographics such as age, sex, and ethnic heritage were not different between lactose malabsorbers and absorbers as defined by the breath hydrogen lactose test. Food-related symptoms in general and after specific foods such as milk, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt were also similar between groups. Prior to testing, 30% of malabsorbers (N = 161) and 36% of absorbers (N = 81) reported lactose-related symptoms (P = NS). The blood glucose response to lactose was abnormal in 60% of malabsorbers and 15% of absorbers. This study confirmed our impression that it is difficult to predict lactose absorption status by clinical parameters. The majority of our lactose malabsorber patients were unaware of lactose-associated symptoms. Furthermore, symptom assessment, demographics, food history, and blood glucose testing did not predict abnormal hydrogen responses to lactose.\r"

The ability to produce H2 was defined by an increase in breath H2 to greater than 20 parts per million within 4 hr of ingesting 10 g of the nonabsorbable sugar lactulose. Overall, 21% of subjects were nonproducers, and the incidence of nonproduction did not vary among the groups. The elderly subjects had significantly greater breath H2 concentrations than the younger subjects at 150 minutes (P less than 0.05). Sex, race, and functional complaints did not influence H2 production.

Twenty such cases were critically assessed on clinical, endoscopic, and histologic grounds, as well as on response to treatment and follow-up data. While 11 patients showed clinicopathologic features consistent with typical chronic ulcerative colitis, the other nine patients appeared to form a different group, for which the term \"lymphoid follicular proctitis\" seemed justified. Lymphoid follicular proctitis was, overall, characterized by rectal bleeding, a congested and granular mucosa without ulceration, abnormal and coalescing hyperplastic lymphoid follicles without acute inflammation, and failure to respond to local steroid therapy. The nature of lymphoid follicular proctitis is uncertain at present but seems unrelated to chronic ulcerative colitis.\r"

The results obtained were as follows: (1) Cysteamine significantly reduced both mucosal and pancreatobiliary alkaline secretion in the proximal duodenum of rats. (2) The ratio of contribution of pancreatobiliary alkaline secretion to total neutralization of acid in the proximal duodenum was 55.9% under continuous perfusion. (3) There was no significant difference between the amounts of alkali per unit volume of the proximal and distal duodenal loops. (4) The alkaline substance secreted by the proximal duodenal mucosa was confirmed to be the bicarbonate. From these findings, it has been concluded that the impairment of bicarbonate secretion by the mucosal epithelium of proximal duodenum, not by Brunner's glands, plays a causative role in cysteamine-induced duodenal ulceration.\r"

Cisplatin given intravenously in a dose of 2 mg/kg resulted in complete interruption of IDMA and produced predominantly phase II-like activity, lasting as long as 24 hr. Six of the seven dogs exhibited retropropagation of spike bursts from the jejunum to the antrum which was accompanied by emesis. Retropropagation of spike bursts did not occur in one dog who did not exhibit emesis. In addition, abnormal spike bursts occurred frequently, including simultaneously occurring spike bursts in both duodenum and jejunum and nonpropagating short spike bursts in isolated segments of the upper small intestine. As phase III of IDMA disappeared, plasma motilin concentrations remained comparable to those in phase II of normal IDMA but without the cyclic increases. These studies indicate that cisplatin interrupts the regular cycle of IDMA as well as the plasma motilin cycle and produces retropropagation of spike bursts and abnormal spike bursts. These changes in both motility and plasma motilin levels may play a part in the mechanism of emesis induced by cisplatin in dogs.\r"

All animals were tested under control conditions, and then two had all external ligamentous attachments between ileum and colon divided; the other pair underwent a sham operation. Coloileal reflux was quantified scintigraphically at colonic pressures of 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg, and ileal motility was recorded concurrently. During control experiments and after sham operations, no dogs showed coloileal reflux at colonic pressures of 20 and 40 mm Hg. At a colonic pressure of 60 mm Hg, two control experiments and one in a dog after sham operation resulted in reflux of 9%, 4%, and 8% of counts, respectively. In contrast, both test dogs (after division of the ligaments) refluxed 30-70% of colonic content in all of four experiments at pressure below 20 mm Hg. In control dogs and in those with a continent ileocolonic junction, ileal motility consisted of scattered clusters of phasic contractions. In dogs with coloileal reflux, these clusters occurred with a similar frequency, but they lasted longer (P less than 0.005). Four weeks later, ileal motility indices in control dogs were significantly less (P less than 0.02) than in animals with divided coloileal ligaments. These observations establish an experimental model for coloileal reflux, support the hypothesis that external ligamentous attachments help maintain continence at the ileocolonic junction, and imply that coloileal reflux changes the motor pattern of the terminal ileum.\r"

The patient's course was marked by encephalopathy, jaundice, hypoglycemia, markedly elevated serum aminotransferase levels, and prolongation of the prothrombin time. Liver biopsy showed extensive hepatocellular necrosis. The patient recovered slowly after discontinuation of the drug. The finding of eosinophilia and increased serum IgE suggests an immunologically mediated mechanism for the Progabide-induced hepatic injury. Alternatively, the lipophilic moiety of Progabide may interact with hepatocyte cell membrane lipids leading to toxic injury. We conclude that Progabide may occasionally cause severe hepatic injury.\r"

  ".W": "Porcine thyroid cells were cultured on collagen gel-coated cover glasses. They were reorganized into polarized monolayer cells; the basal cell membranes were in contact with the collagen gel, and the apical ones faced the culture medium. We studied cytoskeleton organization, resting membrane potentials, and iodine uptake of these cells. The quick-freezing and deep-etching replica method provided three-dimensional images of the cytoskeleton organization. Networks of microfilaments were observed under the apical cell membrane. In the deep cytoplasm and near the basal cell membranes, intermediate filaments predominated and were interlinked with the microfilaments. When the cells were cultured in the presence of TSH, TSH induced the formation of microvilli at the apical cell membranes and the accumulation of microfilaments under these membranes; in the deep cytoplasm, the intermediate filaments were more closely interlinked with the microfilaments. The microfilaments were immunostained with antiactin antibody. Thus, collagen is a factor in determining the cell polarity, and TSH further augments polarization through reorganizing the cytoskeletons. Electrophysiological study revealed that the resting membrane potential of cells cultured in the absence of TSH was -46 mV, and that of cells cultured in the presence of TSH was -58 mV. TSH hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials. These cells took up iodine. TSH in the medium augmented this uptake. TSH augments thyroid cell polarization through reorganizing the cytoskeletons and hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potentials and enhances iodine uptake by the cells.\r"

  ".U": "88137109\r", 
  ".W": "Cytosolic T3-binding protein (CTBP) has been identified in both the ventricle and atrium of adult rat hearts. Its biochemical characteristics and concentration have been determined in the two tissues as a function of thyroid hormone level. In both tissues association and dissociation constants were, respectively, k+1 = 1.3 x 10(8) M-1/min and k-1 = 0.025 min-1. Scatchard analysis of T3 equilibrium binding data revealed a single class of binding sites (Ka = 3.8 x 10(8) M-1). The maximal binding capacity (MBC) was 1400 fmol/mg protein in the ventricle and 730 fmol/mg protein in the atrium. The apparent mol wt of CTBP, determined by gel filtration, was 63.000. Among the thyroid hormone analogs tested in ventricular cytosol, D-T3 had the highest affinity, followed by L-T3, L-T4, 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid, and rT3. These characteristics were very similar to those previously described for rat brain, and dog and rat liver and kidney CTBP. In hypothyroid rats MBC was only increased in the atrium (50-100%); after a single injection of T4 (2 micrograms/10 g BW 3 or 18 h before death) values returned to normal in the atrium and declined in the ventricle (-35%). During postnatal development, the highest MBC value (2000 fmol T3/mg protein) was observed in atria on day 10, i.e. when the serum T4 level was still low, and in the ventricle on day 30 (4000 fmol T3/mg protein) when the serum T4 level was at its highest. Binding affinities were similar in the two tissues at all ages studied. It was twice as high in both these tissues during the first week of development than in adulthood. These results favor a thyroid hormone down-regulation of the binding capacity of CTBP that would be more sensitive to the hormone in the atrium than in the ventricle.\r"

The presence of this rachitic lesion, unexplainable from a nutritional standpoint, prompted an investigation into the vitamin D endocrine system in these animals. The developmental appearance of vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein (calbindin-D9k) and alkaline phosphatase was studied in oc mutant and normal mice from birth to weaning, as were serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], calcium, and phosphorus. Intestinal and renal calbindin-D9k levels were markedly and precociously elevated (4- to 9-fold) in young suckling, but not newborn, mutant mice compared to values in normal controls. Serum 25OHD3 levels were very low to undetectable in 2-week-old mutant mice compared to normal values, while 1,25-(OH)2D3 levels were 6 times higher in mutants. The exact cause of this premature induction in mutants is unknown, but may be due to elevated circulating levels of 1,25-(OH)2D. Alkaline phosphatase activity was similar between phenotypes at all ages. These studies indicate that the rachitic lesion present in oc mutants may be the result of some inherited disorder in vitamin D metabolism in these animals. Alternatively, these data are also consistent with a normal appropriate response to hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia resulting from decreased osteoclastic bone resorption.\r"

In methimazole-treated rats infused with 3 nmol T4/day/100 g BW, the nafenopin inhibitory effect was not significantly different from that in euthyroid rats. Nafenopin treatment had the following effects on peripheral T4 and T3 metabolism in euthyroid rats. The plasma clearance rate of T4 (PCR), which was measured by Alzet minipump infusion of tracer, was increased 2-fold (1.58 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.82 +/- 0.06 ml/h.100 g BW; P less than 0.001; n = 5), while the PCR of T3 was decreased (37.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 53.8 +/- 1.8; P less than 0.001; n = 5). The fecal clearance rate of radioactivity derived from T4 was increased 2-fold (1.93 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.77 +/- 0.07 ml/h.100 g BW), whereas the urinary clearance rate was not significantly modified. The 5'-deiodinase (5'D) activity, measured by deiodination of labeled rT3, was strongly inhibited in liver and kidney, not modified in brown fat and anterior pituitary, and increased in cerebral cortex. In methimazole-treated rats substituted with isopropyl-diiodothyronine only hepatic 5'D activity was decreased. It is concluded that the decrease in serum total and free T4, without alteration in serum T3 and TSH concentrations, resulting from nafenopin treatment is mainly due to changes in peripheral T4 and T3 metabolism, since it is also observed in T4-substituted animals. The increased PCR of T4 cannot be explained by an increase in deiodination activity, since the major 5'D pathways are inhibited after nafenopin treatment, and the urinary clearance rate is not modified. It can partly be explained by an increase in the fecal clearance rate of T4, which could be due to an increase in glucoronoconjugation. In addition, nafenopin was found to be a weak competitor of T4 binding to serum proteins, leading to a small increase in the free T4 fraction which might also contribute to the increased T4 PCR. The decrease in T3 PCR remains to be explained.\r"

  ".U": "88137121\r", 
  ".W": "Rats were selectively bred for susceptibility (S) and resistance (R) to the hypertensinogenic effects of excess salt intake by Dahl and further inbred to virtual homozygosity by Rapp (S/JR and R/JR). The S strain has been shown to have a mutation of the cytochrome P-450-dependent 11 beta,18-hydroxylase resulting in the enhanced production of 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone (18-OH-DOC) compared to that of the R strain. It is known that this enzyme is also responsible for the hydroxylation of deoxycorticosterone at the 19 position to produce 19-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone. Recently, the excretion of 19-nordeoxycorticosterone (19-nor-DOC), a potent mineralocorticoid, has been shown to be markedly increased in S/JR females compared to that in R/JR females consuming a high sodium diet. While the S/JR rat is spontaneously hypertensive, the course of the disease is greatly accelerated and exacerbated by a high sodium diet. If, indeed, 19-nor-DOC is responsible for the spontaneous hypertension in the S/JR rat, then its production should also be higher in the S/JR rat consuming a normal salt diet. Furthermore, since its production is suppressed by NaCl intake, the excretion should be even higher when not suppressed by a high sodium diet. We measured the urinary excretion of 19-nor-DOC, 18-OH-DOC, and corticosterone in male and female S/JR and R/JR rats consuming a normal sodium diet. The excretions of corticosterone and 18-OH-DOC were significantly higher by S/JR of both sexes than by R/JR, with the excretion by female rats being higher than that by male rats within the same strain. The hierarchy of excretion rates of 19-nor-DOC was: S/JR females greater than R/JR females greater than S/JR males greater than R/JR male rats. These studies indicate that while S/JR rats of both sexes develop higher blood pressures than the R/JR even on a standard salt intake, the excretion of 19-nor-DOC does not correlate well with their blood pressure elevation, since the normotensive female R/JR rat excretes significantly higher quantities of 19-nor-DOC than the hypertensive male S/JR rat. Thus, it is unclear whether 19-nor-DOC is playing a significant role in the pathogenesis of the hypertension in the S/JR rat. It also remains unknown whether the renal site of formation of 19-nor-DOC allows access to the mineralocorticoid target sites in the kidney.\r"

Rats were ovariectomized at the beginning of the study. On day 7 of the study, 5-mg slow release pellets of tamoxifen or placebo were implanted sc. All of the rats were killed on day 28 of the experiment. Sections of the proximal tibial metaphysis were stained for acid phosphatase and evaluated histomorphometrically. Ovariectomy resulted in marked loss of bone. Compared to the values in sham-operated animals, the trabecular bone at a sampling site in the secondary spongiosa of ovariectomized rats was reduced by more than 60%, the length of trabecular bone surface covered by osteoclasts was increased by 563%, the percentage of trabecular bone surface covered by osteoclasts was increased by 567%, the mean osteoclast size was increased by 84%, and the number of nuclei per osteoclast was increased by 38%. In contrast, treatment of ovariectomized rats for 3 weeks with tamoxifen restored the histomorphometric measurements to values comparable to those in sham-operated animals. 17 beta-Estradiol increased trabecular bone fractional area in ovariectomized and sham-operated rats, and administration of tamoxifen to estrogen-treated, ovariectomized, and sham-operated animals produced a further increase in trabecular bone. In summary, 1) ovariectomy resulted in large increases in both the number and activity of osteoclasts, 2) the increased bone resorption associated with ovariectomy produced a net loss of trabecular bone, and 3) treatment of ovariectomized rats with tamoxifen prevented these skeletal changes. The results indicate that in the rat, tamoxifen mimics the effects of estrogen on trabecular bone at concentrations that are not uterotropic.\r"

  ".U": "88137128\r", 
  ".W": "Although early work implicated PRL as the pituitary factor inducing rat hepatic PRL receptors, recent studies indicated that GH, not PRL, was responsible. The roles for these two hormones were evaluated on rat hepatocytes cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with insulin (1 microgram/ml), epidermal growth factor EGF (25 ng/ml), glucagon (500 ng/ml), cholera toxin (2 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (10(-8) M), and transferrin (1 microgram/ml) and changed daily. Ovine (o) PRL, bovine (b) GH, or human (h) GH were introduced after 2-4 days of culture, and PRL receptors were measured by determining [125I]hGH binding in the presence and absence of excess oPRL in a total particulate fraction pretreated with 3 M MgCl2. The specific binding of hGH (% per 100 micrograms protein) decreased by 8- to 10-fold (female, 17.9 +/- 0.2% to 1.5%; male, 7.0 +/- 0.1% to 0.7%) after 3 days in culture. When added after 3 days, hGH induced PRL receptors in both female and male cells with the effect being more gradual in the latter. Induction occurred with 10 ng/ml hGH and was maximal [11- to 13-fold control] at 250-1000 ng/ml. bGH and oPRL also induced PRL receptors with maximal levels attained at 250-500 ng/ml oPRL (3- to 4-fold control). The combined addition of oPRL (300 ng/ml) and bGH (300 ng/ml) yielded levels of induction comparable to that seen with hGH. Although hormone treatment restored PRL receptor levels to those seen in male rats, the much higher levels of female rats were not attained. Treatment of hepatocytes with hGH, bGH, or oPRL affected neither cell number (through 10 days of culture) nor PRL receptor affinity. At supramaximal doses hGH, PRL, and bGH down-regulated PRL receptors, but this was particularly noticeable for oPRL and hGH. 17 beta-Estradiol and testosterone added to male and female hepatocytes simultaneously with hGH had little or no effect on receptor induction. We conclude that hepatic PRL receptors are induced by both PRL and GH, each acting through its own receptor. The failure to restore receptor levels to those seen in female rats attests to the importance of other modulators. This dual regulation of the PRL receptor explains the unusual potency of hGH which binds to both PRL and GH receptors.\r"

Treatment with the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (50 mg/kg.day) from days 14-22 of gestation impaired development of the prostate and virilization of the external genitalia in male offspring compared to those in control animals. However, virilization of the internal genitalia (seminal vesicles, epididymis) was unaffected. Simultaneous administration of DHT (50 mg/kg.day) with the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor restored prostate development and anogenital distances of males to normal and virilized the external genitalia of females. We conclude that DHT is the active androgen responsible for prostatic development in the rat.\r"

The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies for PR was confirmed by using competition studies with purified PR and by comparison of the immunostained tissues, known from steroid binding assays to be receptor rich, with immunostained tissues known to be receptor-poor. Immunoreactive PR was found in the nuclei of uterine epithelial, stromal, and smooth muscle cells; benign ductal and lobular epithelial cells of the breast; ovarian surface epithelium; ovarian stroma and luteal cells; pulmonary parenchymal cells; and selected pituitary parenchymal cells. A proportion of the following selected human tumors expressed PR: breast carcinomas, endometrial carcinomas, ovarian carcinomas, and meningiomas. PR was localized to the nuclei of all progesterone target tissues even under conditions where the vast majority of the receptor is unoccupied by steroid, suggesting that the unoccupied as well as the steroid-occupied form of PR are predominantly nuclear proteins, as observed previously for estrogen receptor and rabbit PR.\r"

This suggests that TSH may play a role in the occurrence of LT in this rat model. In contrast to these observations, L-thyroxine administration did not affect the markedly increased incidence of LT or the elevated serum anti-Tg antibodies in iodine supplemented BB/Wor rats, suggesting that TSH stimulation is not necessary for the development of iodine induced LT in this rat model. Other factors, such as the increased antigenicity of highly iodinated Tg, may be more important.\r"

  ".W": "The glomerular ultrafiltration rate varies as a function of age and sex. To further elucidate the basis for the sexual difference, an androgen [Deca-Durabolin (DECA)] was administered to female ovariectomized rats, and glomerular hemodynamics were evaluated by renal micropuncture after 6 and 16 weeks of therapy. Results were compared to those in control ovariectomized female rats injected with vehicle. Therapy did not produce significant differences in body weight, but kidney size was modestly increased in DECA-treated rats at 6 weeks (0.68 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.03 g wet weight; P less than 0.05); at 16 weeks major differences in renal size were documented (0.69 +/- 0.03 vs. 1.18 +/- 0.05 g wet weight; P less than 0.01). The increase in size was primarily due to tubular hypertrophy, with more modest increases in glomerular size. After 6 weeks of therapy, the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) was increased in DECA-treated ovariectomized rats (24.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 32.9 +/- 1.1 nl/min; P less than 0.01). Whole kidney glomerular filtration rate also rose in proportion to increases in kidney size. The greater SNGFR was attributed to higher rates of nephron plasma flow and a numerical increase in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient. However, after 16 weeks of androgen therapy, in spite of marked renal hypertrophy, SNGFR did not further rise in proportion to renal size, and the rate of nephron plasma flow and the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient actually fell relative to those in control untreated rats. Light microscopic evaluation of renal tissue revealed no abnormalities in DECA-treated rats. Thus, 6-week androgen therapy to ovariectomized female rats increased both glomerular ultrafiltration rates and renal size. However, with prolonged administration a glomerular dysfunction may have ensued whereby glomerular ultrafiltration was dissociated from increases in renal size.\r"

However, when pregnancy was maintained in ovariectomized hamsters by daily injections of 0.1 microgram 17 beta-estradiol and 4 mg progesterone, serum IR rose to levels similar to those in intact hamsters on days 10 and 14 of pregnancy (i.e. 15 and 20 ng/ml, respectively).

Since thyroid status and fasting have profound effects on iodothyronine deiodinases in other tissues, the present studies were performed to determine if these perturbations affected P5-Dase. Control and treated rats were mated and killed near term on the 20th day of gestation. P5-Dase was determined in placenta homogenates enriched with dithiothreitol by measuring the conversion of T4 to rT3. In four of five studies, P5-Dase was similar in dams that underwent thyroidectomy (Tx) on day 7 of gestation and sham Tx dams. P5-Dase was not altered in dams that were treated with methimazole (MMI) to induce maternal and fetal hypothyroidism. Treatment of dams with supraphysiological doses of T4, beginning on the seventh day of gestation, did not significantly affect P5-Dase. In three of four studies, P5-Dase was similar in fed dams to values in dams fasted for the last 5 days of pregnancy. Placenta iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase activity (P5'-Dase) was also measured in some studies. P5'-Dase was not decreased in Tx rats and was modestly decreased in MMI-treated rats. However, the effect of MMI was not reversed by the administration of supraphysiological doses of T4, Tx, MMI treatment, and fasting all decreased hepatic T4 5'-deiodinase activity in pregnant rats. These results strongly suggest that thyroid status and fasting do not alter P5-Dase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine amplification of LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation in rat luteal cells is rapid and dependent on mitochondrial ATP production. The objective of the present studies was to determine if this effect of adenosine is specific for LH and to gain information on the mechanism of the ATP-dependent amplification of LH action in rat luteal cells. Adenosine significantly amplified maximum cAMP accumulation in response to LH, isoproterenol, forskolin, and cholera toxin. However, amplification of this response by adenosine was significantly greater for LH than for the other agonists. The relative order of amplification by adenosine was LH greater than isoproterenol greater than forskolin greater than cholera toxin; the relative magnitudes of amplification by adenosine were 1, 0.6, 0.2, and 0.2, respectively. Neither LH, isoproterenol, forskolin, nor cholera toxin had any effect on cellular levels of ATP, and adenosine produced a similar rate of increase and maximal levels of ATP in the presence of all agonists. Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, inhibited LH- and cholera toxin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and produced a dose-dependent depletion of ATP. Adenosine reversed the inhibitory effect of ionomycin on LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation and cellular levels of ATP. However, adenosine did not reverse the inhibitory effect of ionomycin on cholera toxin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, although its effects on cellular ATP levels were identical to those on LH. Thus, the selective amplification of LH by adenosine is not merely a substrate effect on adenylate cyclase activity. The nature of adenylate cyclase activation by cholera toxin and forskolin and the weak amplification by adenosine of these agonists compared to that of LH indicate that the site of the ATP-dependent action of adenosine appears to be before or on the G-protein of adenylate cyclase. We suggest that adenosine, by an ATP-dependent process, either increases the availability of functional LH receptors or increases coupling between the LH receptor and adenylate cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "While it has been shown that estrogen promotes mammary gland growth in vivo, it has not been demonstrated if estrogen acts locally in the mammary gland to produce a mitogenic effect in the epithelial cells or if the mitogenic effect is mediated systemically. The purpose of this study was to distinguish between local vs. systemically mediated modes of estrogen action in normal mammary glands of both immature 5-week-old and sexually mature 10-week-old mice. Elvax 40P, noninflammatory, easily manipulated implant material, was combined with 17 beta-estradiol and placed either directly into the mammary gland to elicit a localized effect or implanted sc to produce a systemic effect. The effect of estrogen on epithelial cell proliferation was assessed by its effect on mammary gland morphology from whole mount examinations and on DNA synthesis by DNA histoautoradiography. The effects of implant location and estrogen dose on mammary and uterine progesterone receptor (PgR) concentrations were also analyzed. The results indicate that estrogen can act locally to stimulate increased epithelial DNA synthesis and an increase in end-bud size in the immature mammary gland. By contrast, no localized effect of estrogen could be demonstrated in the mature mammary gland; it appears that increased epithelial DNA synthesis and ductal side-branching are systematically mediated effects of estrogen. On the other hand, in the case of PgR regulation, estrogen can act locally to increase receptor concentration in the adult gland. In contrast, in the immature mammary gland only low levels of PgR were detectable, and they could not be increased by any method of estrogen treatment. Thus, these results demonstrate that estrogen can act either locally or systemically to produce mitogenic effects on mammary epithelium. However, the age and/or developmental stage of the target tissue are important factors that determine the hormonal responsiveness of normal tissue and which mode (local vs. systemic) of estrogen action will be operative.\r"

  ".U": "88137150\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies clearly demonstrated that cells isolated from the chromatically distinct inner (primarily zona reticularis) and outer (zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa) zones of the guinea pig adrenal cortex have vastly different steroidogenic capabilities; the outer zone produces far more cortisol than the inner zone, and mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity in the inner zone is not modulated by ACTH. Thus, in this study we have investigated the characteristics and properties of cholesterol ester hydrolase (CEHase) and acyl-coenzyme-A/cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) in the outer and inner zones of the guinea pig adrenal to clarify the zonal difference in cholesterol metabolism. CEHase showed two pH optima at around pH 4.5 and pH 7.5 in the outer zone, while optimum activity in the inner zone was found only around pH 4.5, suggesting a lack of neutral CEHase in the inner zone. The acid CEHase was found mainly in the lysosomal fraction, and the neutral CEHase was located mainly in the microsomal fraction. The neutral CEHase activity in the outer zone was significantly enhanced by ether stress, while the acid CEHase activity was not changed in either of the two zones by stress. The basal activity of ACAT was significantly higher in the outer zone than in the inner zone. The present experiments also demonstrated that the inner zone always showed lower ACAT activity than the outer zone even when added cholesterol exogenously. It is suggested that the relatively low activity of ACAT may not always be explained by the reduced content of cholesterol in the microsomal fraction of zona reticularis. ACAT activity in the outer zone was significantly decreased by ether-induced stress, but that in the inner zone was not changed. The content of esterified cholesterol in whole homogenate and the microsomal fraction was significantly decreased in the outer zone, but not in the inner zone, by ether stress. Thus, the decrease in esterified cholesterol after ether stress seems to relate to increased neutral CEHase activity and decreased ACAT activity in the outer zone. The present observation clearly indicates that the lack of neutral CEHase and the lesser activity of ACAT in the inner zone than in the outer zone may contribute to the impaired cholesterol metabolism in the inner zone.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effects of electrical stimulation of the dorsal and ventral ascending noradrenergic tracts in the central nervous system [dorsal (DNT) and ventral (VNT) noradrenergic tracts] during an ongoing LH surge induced by ovarian steroids. A bipolar electrode was implanted in the midbrain of ovariectomized rats, in the region of either the DNT or VNT. One week later the rats were given estradiol benzoate (10 micrograms/100 g BW), followed 3 days later by an injection of progesterone (2 mg) at 1100 h. This steroid treatment resulted in a LH surge in the afternoon which peaked at approximately 1800 h. Biphasic electrical stimulation (50-100 microA; 400 musec; 30 Hz) was applied to the conscious unrestrained rats for 1 h beginning at 1600 h. Electrical stimulation of the DNA (n = 10) for 1 h resulted in significantly lower LH levels at 1700 h. Similar electrical stimulation of the VNT (n = 8) also markedly suppressed LH release at 1700 h. Electrical stimulation of brain sites close to but outside the DNT or VNT were ineffective. After the cessation of electrical stimulation, LH levels began to rise again and at 1900 h were not significantly different from levels in the control rats. To determine if the recovering LH surge could be interrupted further, the effects of a second electrical stimulating session, 2 h after the first one, was investigated in other groups of animals. As expected, electrical stimulation of either the DNT or VNT between 1600 and 1700 h resulted in a transient suppression of the steroid-induced LH surge. The mean LH levels of these animals were on the rise between 1700 and 1900 h. Dramatically, a second electrical stimulation applied to the DNT or VNT from 1900-2000 h again inhibited LH release. Thus, the LH release pattern in these twice-stimulated rats was significantly different from that in either the nonstimulated controls or animals that had received only one electrical stimulation session (at 1600 h). Treatment of the rats with an alpha-adrenergic blocker (phenoxybenzamine) reversed the inhibitory effect of DNT activation on the LH surge. Treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) or a dopamine antagonist (pimozide) was ineffective. These data demonstrate that, similar to intraventricular infusion of norepinephrine, activation of the ascending norepinephrine fibers results in interruption of the steroid-induced LH surge.\r"

  ".W": "It is well established that TSH from the anterior pituitary is the principal stimulatory agent in the physiological regulation of the thyroid gland. Chronic elevations of plasma TSH induce hyperplasia and hypertrophy of thyroid follicular cells and enlargement of blood capillaries. At low plasma TSH levels the thyroid gland atrophies. We have examined the vascular conductance (C = blood flow/mean arterial pressure) of the thyroid gland and several other tissues over a wide range of endogenous plasma TSH concentrations and after treatment with bovine TSH (bTSH) in rats. Tissue blood flows were determined using 15 +/- 5-microns diameter 141Ce-labeled microspheres in a modification of the reference sample microsphere technique. The microspheres were injected directly into the left cardiac ventricle via a 23-gauge needle passed through the chest wall, while the reference blood sample was collected and systemic arterial blood pressure was monitored through femoral arterial catheters. After the animals were killed, tissues were cleaned and weighed, and the tissue radioactivity was determined. Blood samples for determination of plasma hormone levels were obtained from the jugular vein before the injection of microspheres. In the first series of experiments, the vascular C per mass of thyroid gland was significantly decreased 4 and 8 days after hypophysectomy. Treatment of hypophysectomized rats with bTSH (185 mU/100 g.day as a continuous iv infusion for 2 or 6 days) restored thyroid vascular C per mass of tissue to control levels. In the second series of experiments, we manipulated circulating plasma TSH levels in intact rats by 6 days of treatment with propylthiouracil (2.0 mg/day, ip), thyroid hormones (1.5 micrograms T4, 0.4 micrograms T3 or 3.0 micrograms T4, plus 0.8 micrograms T3/100 g.day, sc by continuous infusion), TRH (240 micrograms/day, iv, by continuous infusion), bTSH (800 mU/day, iv, by continuous infusion), or combinations of these treatments. The vascular C per mass of thyroid gland was significantly decreased at very low chronic plasma TSH levels and increased at very high chronic plasma TSH levels. Thyroid vascular C per mass was unchanged, however, over a broad intermediate range of plasma TSH concentrations encompassing normal values, despite alterations in the size and function of the thyroid gland. At these intermediate levels of TSH stimulation, the thyroid gland may respond by adding or subtracting functional units without changing the blood flow per unit. The amount of blood flow per functional unit may be altered only at very high or very low levels of TSH stimulation.\r"

  ".U": "88137157\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies in our laboratory demonstrate that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] increases hepatocyte cytosolic calcium in the absence of extracellular calcium and activates phospholipase-A-induced deacylation of phosphatidylinositol within 5 min. To determine whether inhibition of phospholipase-A affects D-induced increments in cytosolic calcium and which metabolite of phosphatidylinositol mediates these increments, cytosolic calcium is measured in cultured hepatocytes, loaded with Fura 2AM. Cellular fluorescence is determined at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, and cytosolic calcium is calculated. 1,25-(OH)2D treatment for 5 min increases cytosolic calcium levels in the cultured hepatocyte. Inhibition of phospholipase-A with bromophenacylbromide blocks the vitamin D effect on cytosolic calcium, indicating that phospholipase-A activation precedes increments in cytosolic calcium. Neither arachidonic acid nor sodium arachidonate affects cytosolic calcium. In contrast, LPI increases hepatocyte cytosolic calcium in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. The effect is not blocked by bromophenacylbromide. Neither cell viability nor supernatant fluorescence is altered by LPI, indicating that LPI is increasing fluorescence within the cell. 1,25-(OH)2D treatment for 5 min increases cytosolic pH in cultured hepatocytes. Inhibition of cell alkalinization with amiloride blocks the vitamin D effect on both cytosolic pH and cytosolic calcium, but not the effect of LPI on calcium. NH4Cl increases hepatocyte pH but not cytosolic calcium. The results indicate that phospholipase-A activation is necessary for 1,25-(OH)2D-induced increments in hepatocyte cytosolic calcium and that LPI, a deacylation product of phosphatidylinositol, mediates these increments. Furthermore, inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange, while not blocking the ability of the cell to increase cytosolic calcium in response to LPI, prevents the 1,25-(OH)2D-induced increments in both pH and calcium. The data suggest that the rapid effects of 1,25-(OH)2D on hepatocyte calcium are preceded by cell alkalinization and phospholipase-A activation, and these effects appear to be linked to the Na+/H+ antiport system and not nonspecific cell alkalinization.\r"

In this study, we use dense amino acid density shift analyses to address directly the question of whether estrogen increases PR levels in MCF-7 cells by altering rates of receptor synthesis and/or degradation. Using different concentrations of estradiol (E2), which achieve PR levels that are half-maximal (3 X 10(-11) M F2) or maximal (6 X 10(-11) M E2), we have done sucrose gradient density shift analyses using dense (15N, 13C, 2H) amino acid incorporation to study rates of PR synthesis and degradation. These studies reveal a nonlinear loss of preexisting normal density receptor with time. From kinetic modeling analyses, equivalent rates of degradation are estimated for PR whether maximal or half-maximal levels are maintained, indicating that the major effect of E2 on PR content is to increase the rate of PR synthesis while leaving the degradation rate unaltered. The E2-stimulated increase in PR protein is also associated with increased levels of PR mRNA, as demonstrated by the use of a human PR cDNA probe. These density shift data provide evidence that the increased PR levels after estrogen exposure in MCF-7 cells are the result of an increased rate of receptor synthesis, rather than modulation of the rate of receptor degradation.\r"

OT and VP mRNA levels of the supraoptic nucleus were quantified by Northern blot and dot-blot analysis. OT and VP contents of the pituitary gland were determined by RIA. During the estrous cycle, OT mRNA levels of the supraoptic nucleus were significantly increased 1.5- to 2-fold at estrous relative to the other periods of the cycle. No significant cyclic variation was observed in VP mRNA levels. The OT content of the pituitary gland was significantly decreased at estrus and also the VP contents showed a cyclic variation with the lowest levels occurring at estrus and metestrus. At the last day of gestation a 3- and 2-fold increase of OT mRNA and VP mRNA, respectively, was measured, but no changes were observed at gestational day 12, 15, and 18. In rats lactating for 15 days, OT and VP mRNA levels were approximately 3-fold higher than during the estrous cycle. Concomitantly the OT and VP contents of the pituitary gland were decreased by approximately 50%. It is concluded that both OT and VP gene expression are stimulated just before birth and during lactation indicating that both genes are sensitive to common factors. A dissociation of the regulation of the OT and VP genes occurs in the estrous cycle.\r"

However, the magnitude of the complexed fraction prevailing under physiological conditions is unknown because of 1) dissociation of the complex during analysis and 2) potential differences in the binding characteristics of radiolabeled and native hGH. We conducted experiments designed to minimize dissociation during analysis (gel filtration in prelabeled columns, frontal analysis, and batch molecular sieving) with both native and radioiodinated hGH. All three methods yielded similar estimates for the complexed fraction. In normal plasma the bound fraction for 22 K hGH averaged 50.1% (range, 39-59%), that for 20 K hGH averaged 28.5% (range, 26-31%). Above a hGH level of about 20 ng/ml the bound fraction declines in concentration-dependent manner due to saturation of the binding protein. We conclude that a substantial part of circulating hGH is complexed with carrier proteins. This concept has important implications for the metabolism, distribution, and biological activity of hGH.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the role of leumorphin, a kappa-agonist derived from proenkephalin-B (neoendorphin/dynorphin precursor), in the control of arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion, we examined the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of leumorphin on AVP secretion under basal and stimulated conditions in conscious unrestrained rats. Intracerebroventricular injection of leumorphin (60 or 600 pmol) significantly inhibited basal AVP secretion. In 72-h water-deprived rats, icv injection of leumorphin (60 or 600 pmol) also suppressed AVP secretion in a dose-dependent manner. The AVP response induced by icv injection of angiotensin II (100 pmol) was significantly decreased by the simultaneous icv injection of leumorphin (6-600 pmol) in a dose-dependent manner. Intracerebroventricular administration of leumorphin (600 pmol) also reduced the AVP secretion stimulated by icv injection of carbachol (50 pmol). Intravenous pretreatment with naloxone (0.5 mg/kg BW) diminished the inhibitory action of leumorphin (60 pmol) on AVP secretion. However, no effect on AVP secretion was observed after iv injection of leumorphin (600 pmol). These results indicate that leumorphin possesses a potent inhibitory effect on AVP secretion, suggesting its important role in the regulation of AVP secretion in the brain.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma pseudocholinesterase (PsChe) activity was examined in adult female rat hepatocytes isolated by collagenase perfusion and maintained in a chemically defined medium supplemented with dimethyl sulfoxide. Time course studies on PsChe activity in cultured hepatocytes indicate that cells maintained in a chemically defined medium lacking human GH and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) exhibit a decrease in activity after the first 3 days in culture followed by a stabilization of PsChe activity for up to 15 days. GH (0.02, 0.2, and 2 micrograms/ml) increased PsChe activity in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of E2 (10(-5)-10(-7) M) alone to hepatocyte cultures did not cause an increase in PsChe activity. The increases produced by both the 2 micrograms/ml and 0.2 micrograms/ml GH doses plus E2 (10(-7) M) were significantly greater than controls and similar to the increase produced by GH alone. The ability of the hepatocytes to express PsChe activity was not dependent upon the continuous exposure of the cells to GH, since control cultures, maintained for 12 days in medium lacking GH, were able to express a high level of PsChe activity after the addition of GH (2 micrograms/ml) on day 12. This increase was observed in hepatocytes in culture for 30 days. These results indicate that GH plays a pivotal role in the regulation of PsChe activity in vitro, and that under the conditions used in this study, E2 does not influence the ability of hepatocytes in culture to express this enzyme.\r"

The serum estradiol (E2), progesterone (P) and PRL levels 1, 2, and 3 days before and at oocyte retrieval were evaluated. The E2 decrease at oocyte retrieval was significantly steeper in groups I and III. Follicular luteinization was more effective in groups I and III. The fertilization rate in groups I and III was significantly higher than in group II. High serum PRL levels seem to interfere in follicular and oocyte development. The treatment of transient hyperprolactinemia improved the patients' endocrine response and the fertilization rate of oocytes.\r"

Bromocriptine decreased serum and follicular fluid prolactin (PRL), accelerated ovarian follicle growth, increased serum and follicular fluid estradiol, lowered luteal phase progesterone, and shortened the luteal phase length of the cycle. The maximal luteal phase estradiol and progesterone concentrations correlated with each other in the placebo group, but not in the bromocriptine group. These findings indicate that hypoprolactinemia interferes with ovarian function. The unchanged concentrations of gonadotropic hormones and pattern of luteinizing hormone pulsation during bromocriptine suggest direct ovarian effects of hypoprolactinemia. Because PRL suppression enhanced follicular responses and inhibited corpus luteum formation and function, the follicular and corpus luteum actions of PRL may be different.\r"

Spectrophotometric analysis of the follicular fluid in the visible spectrum demonstrated two peaks of maximum absorbance at 415 nm and 455 nm. The group of oocytes that fertilized was associated with follicular fluids that had significantly higher absorbances at 415 nm and 455 nm. In conclusion, follicular fluid volume and scoring of the OCCC were poor predictors of fertilizing capability; however, spectrophotometric absorbance, particularly at 455 nm, was positively correlated with oocyte fertilization.\r"

A longitudinal study with frequent blood sampling was undertaken to link information about nutrition and stress with a quantitative assessment of endocrine menstrual function in 18 endurance-trained athletes and 25 age-matched, nonathletic women. Four athletes did not show hormonal signs of follicular development. The 14 athletes with cyclic gonadal function did not differ from controls with regard to estradiol concentrations during the follicular phase and at midcycle. During the luteal phase, however, they showed significantly reduced areas under the estradiol and progesterone curves. Caloric intake, as assessed by nutritional diaries, correlated positively with the area under the progesterone curve during the luteal phase (rs = 0.70, P less than 0.01). Ratings of subjective stress in the area \"partner, family, friends\" correlated negatively with the luteal progesterone area (rs = 0.80; P less than 0.01). Data support the hypothesis that nutrition and stress may play a critical role in the genesis of menstrual disturbance in athletes.\r"

C. trachomatis was not isolated in any of 52 patients with TFI (TFI group), 114 having tubal ligation (STER group), or 99 patients having hysterectomy (HYST group). However, chlamydial antigen was detected with an immunochemical method in 1 of 16 tubal biopsy specimens from TFI women. The prevalence of chlamydial IgM or IgG antibody in serum was significantly higher (P less than 0.0001) in the TFI group (79.1%) than in the other two groups (relative odds, 6.3; 95% confidence interval: 2.5, 16.8).

In women with TFI, there was no significant association between IgM or IgG seropositivity (P = 0.56). or IgA seropositivity (P = 0.53), and a negative history for PID.

LH was quantitated from urine by an avidin-biotin enzyme immunoassay. The results indicated that a spontaneous LH surge occurred in 18% of the cycles. The number of oocytes recovered was not affected by the occurrence of a spontaneous LH surge. In 12% of all cases, the spontaneous LH surge occurred less than 12 hours before the administration of hCG, and in these cases embryo cleavage was not reduced.

This approach was validated by testing the MAb panel against sections of human testis and epididymis to rule out cross-reactivity with immature germ cells or other reproductive tract cells, and against peripheral blood leukocytes that had been incubated in human semen to ascertain leukocyte marker stability in seminal plasma. When the immunoperoxidase technique was applied to semen smears from 17 proven fertile men and 51 randomly selected infertility patients, the authors found highly varying total leukocyte numbers, ranging from 8970 to 20,520,000 per ejaculate among fertile men (median, 170,000), and from 43,120 to 104,580,000 among infertility patients (median, 1,035,000).

Results are compared with traditional semen analysis methodology. Acceptable precision for count and percent motility was obtained using three to nine random fields of observation when there were more than 10 cells per high-power microscopic field. A highly significant correlation (P less than 0.01) was found between the two methods in the assessment of sperm concentration and percent motility, but CASA overestimated concentration significantly (P less than 0.01) by about 30% when there were less than 60 cells per high power field. This overestimation seemed to be due to the number of nonsperm particles in semen that are confused with spermatozoa by the program. Linear velocity determination was influenced by the number of tracking points as well as by the concentration of cells present in the counting chamber. More representative linear velocity estimations in semen were obtained when sperm concentration was less than 40 x 10(6) cells/ml and 20 tracking points were used in the determination. For semen specimens containing higher cell density, sperm concentration needed to be reduced by diluting the semen with the patient's own sperm-free seminal plasma before measuring motion characteristics.\r"

At all times there was a decrease in the normal ovulatory response, as evidenced by a reduction in the number of corpora lutea when compared with controls. Additionally, the exposure of galactose-treated mice to a superovulatory regimen of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) failed to induce an increased ovulatory response. Morphologic alterations, such as the increase in interstitial tissue and the appearance of lipofuscin, coupled with the failure to respond to exogenous gonadotropins, suggest that the reduced ovulatory response may be occurring at the level of the ovary. This effect, however, is reversible with cessation of galactose treatment.\r"

Implantation is aided by a metal stylus inserted in each plug to give the plug rigidity. The stylus is removed after insertion of the plug into the vas deferens. Two separate primate experiments showed that the device completely prevents sperm transport over a 7-month period. Upon device removal, all of the primates ejaculated spermatozoa again at normal concentrations and motility. These results indicate the potential contraceptive use of the device and encourage its validation in men.\r"

In conclusion, laparoscopists and microsurgeons need to be aware of the possibility of finding ovarian cancer in these young, infertile women, and this knowledge should be used to counsel and manage the patient appropriately.\r"

Several respondents did not carry an adequate range of BP cuff sizes suitable for small or large adult arms. Additionally, the majority of family physicians in the sample did not calibrate their BP cuffs in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. In general, the evidence accumulated leads to questions about the overall accuracy of BP measurement in family physician offices.\r"

  ".W": "The American Board of Medical Specialties recently approved the concept of certificates of added qualifications in geriatrics within both internal medicine and family practice. Certification requirements have been worked out for each training model, and questions have quite naturally arisen addressing whether the developing family practice model is substantially different from the longer established internal medicine model. A survey was made of 12 family practice based geriatric fellowship programs. Program directors were asked how they felt family practice geriatrics differed from internal medicine geriatrics in approaches to patient care and training and in areas of research interests. Information was also gathered about program size, length of training, and operational status. Eight fellowship programs were found to be active at the time of the survey, but only two for more than six months. Of the eight functioning programs, four were currently without fellows--a forewarning, perhaps, of potential recruitment problems for additional programs under development. Survey responses indicated a universal feeling among directors of family practice geriatric programs that their model does serve a unique function. Within the \"distinguishing characteristics\" most frequently noted, an emphasis on psychosocial and family issues can be identified. This emphasis can also be seen in the suggestions for distinctive research, with an indication of special interest in the delivery of health care.\r"

A total of 329 alumni from 12 of the 59 HHS programs and all five of the RWJ programs were surveyed. Based on a 74% response rate, profiles are drawn of graduates. These profiles are compared to a review of the literature in higher education on fellowships, faculty attrition, faculty activities, tenure, and promotion. Conclusions reached from these comparisons include: (1) The retention rate of fellows in full-time faculty positions equaled or exceeded those of other fellowships found in the literature. (2) The attrition rate of alumni from faculty positions has been less than that noted of faculty in other areas of higher education. (3) On average, fellowship graduates have spent less time in research activities than recommended for productivity. (4) The emphasis on research training, particularly in RWJ fellowships, was appropriate, given increasing expectations for research productivity in tenure and promotion decisions. (5) The national trend toward development of alternatives to traditional tenure tracks matches the patterns found in family medicine fellowship alumni--31% of these alumni were serving on such tracks.\r"

Patients also provided estimates of their own waiting times and ratings of the acceptability of these waits. The data were analyzed to assess whether any differences exist in terms of waiting times, times with providers, and waiting time satisfaction for patients seen by clinical clerks (medical students), resident physicians, and attending physicians. Consultation times were longer for patients seen by learners, but waiting times were shorter for these patients. Importantly, there were no significant differences in terms of patient satisfaction with consultation time or waiting time satisfaction. Thus, while learners made a noticeable impact on consultation time, the overall effect on the patient booking system was marginal, and there was no negative impact on patient wait time satisfaction. To control for unevenness of type of providers assigned to the different services, only intermediate assessments are included in this study. The conclusions should not be generalized for other types of services.\r"

In 1985 and 1986 vaccine was offered to patients who attended one family practice for any reason during the months of October and November. In 1985 if patients had not received vaccine by October 31 an informational letter recommending immunization was also mailed. In 1986 nonimmunized patients were telephoned by the family practice nurse and informed of the rationale, availability, and advisability of receiving the vaccine. The immunization rate improved in patients attending the practice over the two study years. Additional outreach efforts showed a high degree of failure or refusal to receive immunization.\r"

To date, analyses have focused on the individual differences between the two groups and not on the context--the larger system--in which the two work. This article examines these systemic problems, particularly problems specific to family medicine. Coping methods which can be used by behavioral scientists are proposed to help them reduce the work stress they experience.\r"

Previous reports have described networks that collect descriptive data from many practices, but there are difficulties in establishing and managing large networks. Accordingly, smaller networks may be more valuable in some settings and for some clinical questions. At the University of Missouri, we have developed a research network composed of four rural family practices and a group of study coordinators. Research topics have been chosen, study methods devised, funding obtained, and valuable data collected. Although logistical problems with any diverse network are formidable, a structured approach with careful communication can overcome these difficulties. The lessons from this experience combined with those of larger primary care networks should assist others in implementing research consortiums. Collaborative research by family physicians is practical, feasible, personally and professionally rewarding, and likely to contribute important primary care knowledge.\r"

The diagnostic approach to knee pain can be categorized anatomically and according to etiology: Is the pain coming from the bone (patella, femur, tibia, fibula), or the soft tissue (ligament, tendon, capsule, synovium, meniscus, muscle)? Is it degenerative, inflammatory, metabolic, traumatic, infectious, or neoplastic? These issues are included in the discussion.\r"

Five suction electrodes were placed (5-7 mm apart) on isolated rings of human colon and simultaneously electrical and motor activities were measured. In normal Krebs solution, the slow waves were not synchronised in most preparations studied. The electrical activities at the different recording sites were different with respect to slow wave frequency and amplitude, and amount of spiking activity. This resulted in irregular contractile activity. Cholinergic stimulation resulted in the development of a specific pattern of electrical activity: periodic slow wave activity with superimposed spiking activity which was synchronised over the length of the segment studied. This synchronised electrical activity resulted in regular phasic contractions at the frequency of the bursts of electrical activity (approximately 1/min). The response to carbachol was mediated by muscarinic receptors since it was blocked by atropine. The periodic activity in the continuous presence of carbachol was not the result of periodic input of neural activity as it occurred in the presence of TTX. Intrinsic properties of the muscle cells were responsible for the carbachol induced pattern of activity. The present study presents evidence that the electrical correlate of circumferential contractions is different in man compared with the most commonly studied animal models. It is a specific, stimulus induced pattern of myogenic activity. Its characteristics closely resemble those of a particular pattern of in vivo recorded activity referred to as the 'long spike bursts'.\r"

  ".W": "In order to assess the frequency and profile of cirrhosis in the young, 169 consecutive patients with cirrhosis were studied. Sixty three (37%) patients of less than or equal to 35 years age were defined as young and the remaining 106 (63%) patients (greater than 35 years) as adult cirrhotics. Men predominated significantly (p less than 0.01) in the young cirrhotic group. The aetiology, the frequency of positive hepatitis B markers and initial clinical presentation were similar in the two groups. During the follow up period (30.6 +/- 29.7 months for the young and 25.8 +/- 21.7 months for the adult group), except for abdominal distension and pedal oedema which occurred significantly more often in the adult compared with the young cirrhotics, no difference was noted in the two groups. Twenty seven (39.7%) deaths (40% as a result of hepatic failure and 52% due to variceal bleeding) occurred in the young and 47 (44.3%) deaths (63.8% because of hepatic failure and 26% because of variceal bleeding) occurred in the adult cirrhotics during the follow up (difference NS). The five year survival (61.9% v 55.7%) and the probability of survival within the same Child's grade of liver disease were comparable. In both the groups, however, the probability of survival was significantly higher in Child's A compared with Child's B and C and in Child's B compared with Child's C grade of liver disease. Survival was not influenced by sex of the patient and aetiology of cirrhosis. Results of this prospective study indicate that cirrhosis is not uncommon in young adults.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Among 185, successfully reexamined on average 19 months after surgery, 26 (14%) developed gall stones. The fall in plasma cholesterol after surgery exhibited a U-shaped relation to risk of gall stone formation with a minimum risk around the average fall (2.6 mmol/l). This was confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analysis (p less than 0.01) taking into account other possible determinants. The relation was not significantly dependent on weight loss or ratio between jejunum and ileum left in function. The study suggests that malabsorption induced fall in plasma cholesterol is related to risk of gall stone formation by two oppositely working mechanisms, one enhancing and one reducing the risk.\r"

Endoscopic sphincterotomy was successful in 105 patients (99%). Early ES related complications occurred in 21 patients (19.8%). Twelve hospital deaths occurred (11.3%), although this was due to biliary causes in only five (4.7%) and one of these was moribund on admission. Complications were more frequent in those in whom initial ES did not clear the common bile duct (30.4%) compared with those in whom this was (11.7%; p = 0.0164). The mortality was also greater in patients in whom there was no ERCP proof of CBD clearance (p = 0.01) unless operated upon. Twelve patients developed gall bladder complications (11.3%) including five with empyema (4.7%). Analysis of clinical, haematological, and biochemical factors together with ERCP findings showed that the only factor which had any value in predicting gall bladder complications was pre-existing cholangitis. The present series was compared with another using ES as a definitive procedure, and with a surgical series. Although there were significant differences in outcome, differences with respect to medical risk factors and the incidence of complications of CBD stones (jaundice, cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis) were striking. Further analysis of these factors may allow a clearer definition of patients most likely to benefit from either ES or surgery.\r"

The maximum tolerable rectal volume (380 +/- 30 v 290 +/- 20 [mean +/- SEM] ml: p less than 0.05) and the bladder capacity (720 +/- 50 v 540 +/- 10 [mean +/- SEM] ml: p less than 0.001) were also increased in the constipated subjects compared with controls. Electromyographic studies show failure of relaxation of the external anal sphincter (EAS) on attempted defecation in all 10 patients; and eight of these patients actually contracted their EAS when they strained to defecate, causing a functional outlet obstruction. Urodynamic studies showed normal urinary flow rates, normal detrusor pressures and normal radiology during voiding. Thus, these studies suggest that constipated patients have an increase in capacity and a reduction in sensitivity in the urinary bladder as well as in the rectum, but showed no evidence of obstruction to urine flow.\r"

  ".W": "About 5% of normal subjects fail to produce increased hydrogen breath concentration after ingestion of the non-digestible carbohydrate lactulose (low hydrogen producers). The existence of low hydrogen producers limits the diagnostic use of hydrogen (H2) breath tests. We studied the effects of lactulose and of magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) pretreatment on stool-pH and on hydrogen exhalation after oral loading with lactulose or lactose in 17 hydrogen producers and 12 low hydrogen producers. In seven hydrogen producers acidification of stool pH by lactulose pretreatment (20 g tid) decreased hydrogen exhalation and three of seven (43%) became low hydrogen producers. In contrast, after pretreatment of eight low hydrogen producers with magnesium sulphate (5 g twice daily) all eight produced hydrogen after a lactulose load. Similarly four lactose intolerant low hydrogen producers had abnormal lactose hydrogen breath tests after MgSO4 pretreatment. MgSO4 pretreatment neither resulted in false positive lactose hydrogen breath tests in five lactose tolerant hydrogen producers, nor increased the hydrogen exhalation in five additional hydrogen producing controls after ingestion of lactulose. The results of these studies confirm that hydrogen production from lactulose decreases when the colonic pH is lower (lactulose pretreatment), and increases when colonic pH is higher (MgSO4 pretreatment). In low hydrogen producers the lacking increase of H2 exhalation after ingestion of non-digestible carbohydrates can be overcome by MgSO4 pretreatment, thus increasing the sensitivity of the test by avoiding false negative hydrogen breath tests in low hydrogen producers with disaccharide malabsorption or maldigestion. The underlying mechanism of this remarkable effect of MgSO4 pretreatment warrants further investigation.\r"

After a single exposure with appropriate laser parameters, dimethylhydrazine induced rat colonic neoplasms underwent coagulative necrosis, sloughed off over a four day period, and left an ulcer which healed within 28 days. Inadequate laser energy resulted in incomplete tumour necrosis whilst excessive laser power or energy increased the likelihood of perforation. Treatment of normal colon with 1 Watt for 30 seconds or longer resulted in coagulative damage which healed by granulation. Mean colonic bursting pressures were significantly decreased one hour after treatment with 1 Watt for 75 or 100 seconds compared with untreated colon (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001 respectively) but not in colon treated with 1 Watt for 30 or 50 seconds. In animals treated with 1 Watt for 100 seconds mean bursting pressures were significantly lower than untreated animals when the animals were killed two, four, and seven days after lasering (p less than 0.001 in each case) but not in animals killed at 11, 17, or 21 days. The technique may be of value in the treatment of some inoperable colorectal cancers and sessile polyps in man.\r"

Previous studies have suggested that sorbitol ingestion may be an additional cause of non-specific gastrointestinal distress. We evaluated sorbitol malabsorption in 30 healthy volunteers, seven patients with untreated coeliac disease and nine patients with coeliac disease on a gluten free diet, using a four hour H2 breath test. After ingestion of test solutions containing sorbitol 10 and 20 g and of four sweets (6.8 g sorbitol), 90%, 100%, and 62% of healthy volunteers, respectively had significantly raised H2 excretion, indicating malabsorption of sorbitol. Of all healthy subjects tested, 45% after 10 g, 100% after 20 g, and 50% after four sweets complained of symptoms of carbohydrate intolerance during the eight hours after sorbitol. After a 5 g dose given at concentrations of 2%, 4%, 8%, 16%, malabsorption was shown in 10%, 12%, 22%, and 43% of the healthy volunteers. Symptoms of intolerance at 5 g were experienced only at concentrations of 8% and 16%. Unlike healthy volunteers and coeliac patients on a gluten free diet, 100% of untreated coeliacs malabsorbed a 2% solution of 5 g sorbitol. These results show that malabsorption and intolerance of sorbitol may result from ingestion of doses and/or concentrations usually found in many foods and drugs; they underline the need to consider this as a possible and hitherto underestimated cause of gastrointestinal symptoms.\r"

Incidence rates were greater in woman than men, were higher in the urban portions of the county, and rose over time. Overall, the natural history of Crohn's disease in the community may be milder than that reported for patients at referral centres, as over half of all patients had no complications and only a third required surgery for Crohn's disease. Only one developed adenocarcinoma of the colon (relative risk = 2.0, NS). Survival was relatively unimpaired for the cohort, but Crohn's disease may have played a role in half of the deaths. The prevalence of Crohn's disease was 90.5/100,000 population on 1 January 1980.\r"

Urinary recovery was significantly increased during the early (day 7) and acute (day 10) stages of the infection compared with values in control rats but subsequently returned to normal. Urinary clearance of the probe after iv injection was unaltered during infection. Villus atrophy occurred only at the stage, whereas crypt hyperplasia was evident at both the early and acute stages. The terminal ileum appeared normal and showed normal permeability when compared with controls. We conclude that permeability changes are local to the site of inflammation, are reversible after healing and may be related to an increase in the proportion of relatively undifferentiated epithelium.\r"

Some patients develop intestinal strictures and present with subacute intestinal obstruction. The treatment is controversial and vary from a trial of antituberculous drugs to early surgery:the response to medical therapy is not clear. To examine this issue the present prospective therapeutic trial was carried out on 39 patients with symptoms of bowel obstruction and radiological evidence of intestinal stricture. All patients were treated with conventional antituberculous drugs (streptomycin, rifampicin, and isoniazid) under close supervision. Thirty four (87%) patients completed the trial, five were lost to follow up. Thirty one (91%) of these showed significant clinical improvement:26 became completely symptom free, while the remaining five complained of only vague abdominal discomfort. Only three (8%) patients failed to respond to treatment and were subjected to surgery. Barium series were repeated in 23 of 31 who completed the treatment; the remaining eight refused further investigations. Complete resolution of the radiological abnormality was seen in 16 (70%) patients. In the remaining seven (30%) the stricture persisted; in two of these the treatment was continued for another year and both showed substantial radiological improvement. It is concluded that most patients with tuberculous strictures respond well to medical treatment and surgery should be resorted to only if drug therapy fails.\r"

Single intravenous doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg omeprazole inhibited PAO by 30% (p less than 0.01), 45% (p less than 0.01), 61% (p less than 0.01), and 80% (p less than 0.01), respectively when measured 1.5 h after dose, and by 20% (NS), 27% (NS), 36% (p less than 0.01) and 59% (p less than 0.01), respectively when measured 24 h after dose. Six days after repeated once daily intravenous doses of 10 and 20 mg omeprazole, PAO was inhibited by 63% (p less than 0.01) and 82% (p less than 0.01), respectively when measured 1.5 h after dose, and by 32% (p less than 0.01) and 43% (p less than 0.01), respectively when measured 24 h after dose. The inhibition of PAO by 10 mg administered intravenously as a single bolus injection was comparable with the inhibition by 20 mg as a single oral dose. Repeated once daily administration of 10 mg intravenously and 20 mg orally also resulted in comparable reductions in PAO. The reduction in PAO after repeated once daily oral administration of 20 mg was comparable with the effect of a single intravenous dose of 40 mg. Terminal half lives were short, but significantly (p less than 0.05) prolonged after a single intravenous injection of 80 mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The existence of a lag phase during the gastric emptying of solid foods is controversial. It has been hypothesised that among other early events, the stomach requires a period of time to process solid food to particles small enough to be handled as a liquid. At present no standardised curve fitting techniques exist for the characterisation and quantification of the lag phase or the emptying rate of solids and liquids. We have evaluated the ability of a modified power exponential function to define the emptying parameters of two different solid meals. Dual labelled meals were administered to 24 normal volunteers. The subjects received meals consisting of either Tc-99m in vivo labelled chicken liver or Tc-99m-egg, which have different densities, and In-111-DTPA in water. The emptying curves were biphasic in nature. For solids, this represented an initial delay in emptying or lag phase followed by an equilibrium emptying phase characterised by a constant rate of emptying. The curves were analysed using a modified power exponential function of the form y(t) = 1-(1-e-kt)beta, where y(t) is the fractional meal retention at time t, k is the gastric emptying rate in min-1, and beta is the extrapolated y-intercept from the terminal portion of the curve. The length of the lag phase and half-emptying time increased with solid food density (31 +/- 8 min and 77.6 +/- 11.2 min for egg and 62 +/- 16 min and 94.1 +/- 14.2 min for chicken liver, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence in Eire was 0.31 cases/10(5) population/year and this was significantly higher than in England and Wales (0.1/10(5)/year), Scotland (0.06/10(5)/year/or Northern Ireland (0.02/10(5)/year). Details of age at diagnosis were only obtained for 36 of the 129 patients. The disease appeared to become commoner with increasing age but there is no evidence of a delay in diagnosis until early adulthood. Such a delay would not account for the apparent regional variations in incidence, as they have also been reported in adults. Southern Irish children are at greater risk of the disease than other children in the British Isles.\r"

Maximum stimulation (varying between 260 and 547%) was reached after four hours incubation with 2 and 4 mg/ml Ig concentrations. The 13 patients with gastric cell stimulating antibodies (GCS-Ab), all male patients, developed the disease at a younger age (nine of 13 under the age of 30), had a longer duration of symptoms (mean 18.4 years), and had a higher incidence of DU in their families (61%). Eight of 13 (61%) in the GCS-Ab+ group did not respond to anti-H2-R drugs, whereas in the negative patients only three of 17 (18%) were classified as 'non-responders'. Remarkably few conventional autoantibodies were detected in our series. Gastric cell stimulating antibodies are a new addition to the growing list of receptor antibodies in human diseases and the described in vitro test should provide an easier tool for screening large populations.\r"

  ".W": "We performed simultaneous noninvasive measurements of common carotid artery and brachial artery hemodynamics in nine normal subjects and 10 subjects with sustained essential hypertension. In hypertensive subjects, brachial artery blood flow and forearm vascular resistance were in the normal range while carotid artery blood flow and carotid artery resistance were decreased and increased, respectively. The most important findings were the changes in the internal caliber of large arteries. Although the brachial and carotid artery diameters of hypertensive subjects were measured for the same level of mean arterial pressure, brachial artery diameter was significantly increased and carotid artery diameter was strictly normal as compared with values found in normal subjects. To assess whether carotid artery circulation could influence the baroreceptor reflex response to arteriolar vasodilation, carotid artery and brachial artery hemodynamics were measured in immediate succession in normotensive and hypertensive subjects before and after oral administration of cadralazine, a dihydralazine derivative. After cadralazine treatment, carotid artery tangential tension decreased in hypertensive subjects, and the changes were significantly correlated to the increase in heart rate. A similar correlation was found in normal subjects, but it was reset toward higher heart rates. These results indicate that the carotid artery does not behave like the brachial artery in response to a chronic increase in blood pressure. This behavior indicates intrinsic alterations of the arterial wall and might be involved in the resetting of the carotid baroreceptor reflex. Carotid artery circulation could play a role in hypertension by modulating the carotid baroreceptor mechanisms involved in the response to drug-induced arteriolar vasodilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four groups were prepared by 1) adrenalectomy only (n = 5); 2) adrenalectomy plus aldosterone, 6 micrograms/24 hr i.p. (n = 5); or 3) adrenalectomy plus dexamethasone, 10 micrograms/24 hr i.p. (n = 5), using miniosmotic pumps; and 4) sham adrenalectomy (controls; n = 5). Plasma corticosterone was undetectable in all three adrenalectomized groups. Plasma aldosterone concentration was similar in aldosterone-replaced and sham-operated controls. Pressor responses to various doses of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and norepinephrine were determined in unanesthetized, undisturbed rats. Compared with both control and dexamethasone-replaced rats, pressor responses to all three agonists were significantly reduced in both nonreplaced adrenalectomized and aldosterone-replaced groups. Comparing the ratios of the pressor responses to angiotensin I and angiotensin II in the four groups over the entire dose range suggests that a greater fraction of injected angiotensin I was converted to angiotensin II in nonreplaced adrenalectomized rats than in the other three groups. We conclude that glucocorticoid action markedly contributes to the systemic pressor effect of angiotensin and norepinephrine. However, glucocorticoid deficiency does not impair in vivo conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.\r"

  ".W": "The role of smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, hyperploidy, and hyperplasia in medial hypertrophy of mesenteric resistance vessels of 107- to 111-day-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was examined using a combination of morphometric, biochemical, and immunological techniques. Mesenteric arteries were classified on the basis of branching order for comparative purposes. Branch level I vessels were those that directly enter the jejunal wall, while Branches II to IV represented more proximal vessels; Branch IV vessels were those that branch from the superior mesenteric artery. Medial hypertrophy was assessed in perfusion-fixed vessels by morphometric evaluation of medial cross-sectional area and smooth muscle content. Medial cross-sectional area and smooth muscle content were significantly increased in larger (Branches III and IV) but not smaller (Branches I and II) mesenteric resistance vessels of SHR compared with control normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and hyperploidy were evaluated in isolated cells obtained by enzymatic dissociation of mesenteric resistance vessels. Approximately 80% of the cells in these preparations were identified as smooth muscle cells using a smooth muscle-specific isoactin antibody. Feulgen-DNA microdensitometric evaluation of isolated cells showed that polyploid cells were present in mesenteric resistance vessels but at very low frequencies, and no differences were apparent between SHR and WKY. Likewise, no differences in cellular protein content or relative smooth muscle cell size (i.e., area profile) were observed between cells obtained from SHR and WKY vessels. These results demonstrate that the increase in medial smooth muscle content observed in larger mesenteric resistance vessels of SHR cannot be accounted for by smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperploidy, inferring that hyperplasia must be present. Results indicate that studies of the initiating mechanisms for medial smooth muscle hypertrophy in SHR resistance vessels, at least relatively early in hypertension, should focus on examination of factors that induce true cellular proliferation rather than hypertrophy and hyperploidy.\r"

  ".W": "The extent of extracortical bone-bridging and ingrowth into porous-coated prostheses for the stabilization of segmental defects was studied in a canine model. Initial fixation of the implant was achieved using bone cement. Autogenous bone grafts were applied over the porous-coated segmental portion of the prosthesis to stimulate the ingrowth and formation of bone. At twelve weeks, bone-bridging and ingrowth occurred uniformly in both the titanium fibermesh and the cobalt-chromium-molybdenum beaded prostheses. Maximum formation of osseous tissue over the implants occurred at two to four weeks. More bone formed in the posterior aspect of the prosthesis. At twelve weeks, 26 per cent of the porous space of the titanium fibermesh prosthesis and 47 per cent of the porous space of the cobalt-chromium-molybdenum beaded prosthesis were filled with bone. The torsional strength and stiffness of the prosthetic midsection that contained a conical coupling joint were increased significantly due to bone-bridging and ingrowth. The cortical bone that was apposed to the segmental prosthesis showed an increase in porosity. The use of bone cement did not appear to impede new-bone formation extracortically. The initial stability of the implant and the application of sufficient autogenous bone grafts are two important factors that contribute to the ultimate stable fixation of an implant by extracortical bone formation.\r"

The length of follow-up ranged from three to twenty years, and the age at operation ranged from ten to twenty-three years. The indication for the operation was either painful dysplasia or gross instability of the hip. Twelve patients had had congenital dislocation of the hip; six, poliomyelitis; three, cerebral palsy; and three had had another disorder. A good or excellent result was obtained in twenty-one of the twenty-four patients. Preoperative pain and antalgic gait were consistently improved. In twenty-one patients, the osteotomy had to be displaced more than 50 per cent to provide adequate coverage of the femoral head, and bone-grafting was necessary at the site of the osteotomy to prevent problems with healing.\r"

A specifically designed protocol for imaging, producing T1 sagittal images interleaved at four millimeters while the patient's foot was in 20 degrees of external rotation, was utilized. This technique, called selective magnetic resonance imaging, yielded excellent visualization of the posterior cruciate ligament, medial meniscus, and lateral meniscus in all patients. However, in only 76 per cent of the patients was the anterior cruciate ligament well visualized. Compared with arthroscopy, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of selective magnetic resonance imaging were, respectively, 95.8, 100, and 98 per cent for tears of the medial meniscus; 66.7, 95.1, and 90 per cent for tears of the lateral meniscus; undefined, 100, and 100 per cent for tears of the posterior cruciate ligament; and 100, 96.9, and 97.3 per cent for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, when that ligament was well visualized. Our selective sequence can be performed in fifteen minutes at a cost that is comparable with that of arthrography. It is totally non-invasive and requires no exposure to ionizing radiation. Selective magnetic resonance imaging can be a safe and valuable adjunct to the clinical evaluation of the knee and an aid to efficient preoperative planning.\r"

Preoperative values for transcutaneous oxygen tension were a much more consistent predictor of success or failure of healing after an amputation of the foot or distal to the knee than were measurements of systolic blood pressure at the ankle, but neither was predictive of the outcome after an above-the-knee amputation.\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients--six who had a bicondylar fracture of the tibia and two who had a complex fracture-dislocation--were treated by open reduction and internal fixation that was achieved through an anterior approach to the knee. The approach included elevation of the tibial tubercle, proximal retraction of the extensor mechanism (patellar tendon, retropatellar fat pad, and patella), and transection and detachment of the anterior horn of one or both menisci. The extent of the approach depended on the specific need for exposure. The quality of reduction was better and the rate of complications was lower, compared with conventional approaches. The main advantage of this approach is that the tibial plateau and the intercondylar notch are exposed clearly and completely; this is a prerequisite for the rapid reconstruction of the joint surface and, in some patients, for the reattachment or primary suture of the cruciate ligaments. I recommend the anterior approach with osteotomy of the tibial tubercle in the treatment of patients who have a severe displaced bicondylar fracture of the proximal end of the tibia.\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen male athletes who were skilled in throwing and who had chronic anterior instability of the shoulder (Group 1) were evaluated by dynamic intramuscular electromyography while pitching a baseball. Indwelling wire electrodes recorded the levels of activity in the biceps, middle deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, pectoralis major, subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior throughout the entire pitching sequence. These signals were synchronized electronically with records of the pitch that were made using high-speed photography. The pitch was divided into five phases: wind-up, early cocking, late cocking, acceleration, and follow-through. The results were compared with previous identical studies of twelve healthy, uninjured male athletes who were skilled in throwing (Group 2). Activity increased mildly in the biceps and supraspinatus in Group 1 as compared with Group 2. Similar patterns of activity were demonstrated in the deltoid. In Group 1 the infraspinatus had increased activity during early cocking and follow-through but had decreased activity during late cocking. The pectoralis major, subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior in Group 1 all were shown to have markedly decreased activity. The study revealed a difference between Groups 1 and 2 in all of the muscles of the shoulder that were tested with the exception of the deltoid. The mildly increased activity levels of the biceps and supraspinatus that were found in Group 1 may compensate for anterior laxity. The marked reduction in activity in the pectoralis major, subscapularis, and latissimus dorsi added to the anterior instability by decreasing the normal internal-rotation force that is needed during the phases of late cocking and acceleration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty normal subjects and twelve patients who had anterior instability of the shoulder were evaluated with this technique. In the control group, the humeral head was centered in the glenoid cavity throughout the horizontal plane of motion except when the arm was in maximum extension and external rotation. In this position, the cocked stage of the throwing motion, the center of the humeral head rested approximately four millimeters posterior to the center of the glenoid cavity. When the arm was flexed or rotated from this cocked position, the humeral head glided anteriorly, producing a shearing stress on the articular surface of the glenoid and labrum. In seven of the twelve patients who had anterior instability, abnormal mechanics were observed: anterior translation of the humeral head occurred. This indicates a significant disruption of the structures responsible for containing the humeral head within the glenoid fossa.\r"

Each of the injuries had resulted from a motor-vehicle accident. Thirteen patients had had a posterior dislocation with an associated fracture of the femoral head located either caudad or cephalad to the fovea centralis (Pipkin Type-I or Type-II injury), one had had a posterior dislocation with associated fractures of the femoral head and neck (Pipkin Type III), two had had a posterior dislocation with associated fractures of the femoral head and the acetabular rim (Pipkin Type IV), and three had had a fracture-dislocation that we could not categorize according to the Pipkin classification. Twelve patients had been treated by closed reduction for a Type-I or Type-II injury; one, by open reduction after an unsuccessful closed reduction for a Type-I injury; one, by primary total hip replacement for a Type-III injury; and three, by open reduction with screw fixation of the acetabular fracture and removal of the fragment of the head for two Type-IV injuries and one unclassified injury. An additional two patients had had both a fracture of the femoral neck and a dislocation; one hip was treated primarily with a Moore prosthesis and the other was left unreduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The refracture was always different from the original fracture in type and site (being located an average of 4.3 centimeters distal to the lesser trochanter). Five of the refractures were recognized intraoperatively at the time of removal of the nail.

All patients were treated with traditional closed reduction, but the duration of immobilization before commencement of active motion varied. Goniometric, photographic, and radiographic data were compiled for these patients, who had an average follow-up of 34.4 months. Despite the generally favorable prognosis for this injury, 60 per cent of the patients reported some symptoms on follow-up. A flexion contracture of more than 30 degrees was documented in 15 per cent of the patients; residual pain, in 45 per cent; and pain on valgus stress, in 35 per cent. Prolonged immobilization after injury was strongly associated with an unsatisfactory result. The longer the immobilization had been, the larger the flexion contracture (p less than 0.001) and the more severe the symptoms of pain were. The results indicate that early active motion is the key factor in rehabilitation of the elbow after a dislocation.\r"

Consistent patterns of force transmission were demonstrated in the three specimens that were studied. The greatest force transmission occurred between zero and 30 degrees of flexion, and it consistently decreased with increased flexion. Force transmission was consistently greater in magnitude when the forearm was in pronation than when it was in supination. The varus-valgus pivot point with the elbow extended was established to closely approximate the line of action of the brachial muscle, which crosses near the center of the lateral portion of the trochlea.\r"

Ninety-three accidents involved the use of a minibike or dirtbike; seventy-two, a snowmobile; fifty-nine, a three-wheeled all-terrain vehicle; and nine, a four-wheeled all-terrain vehicle. The injuries in 73 per cent of the children occurred in a rural setting. The use of alcohol or a drug was recorded for only three children. Loss of control of the vehicle led to the majority of injuries. There were 352 fractures of an extremity or the spine and fifty-one major soft-tissue injuries of the musculoskeletal system; 186 (53 per cent) of the fractures were displaced, 107 (46 per cent) of the patients had more than one fracture, and thirty-four (10 per cent) of the fractures were open. There were sixty growth-plate injuries. A total of 186 associated injuries were present in ninety-one patients. In a separate review of the records of the Chief Medical Examiner, it was noted that twenty-one fatal accidents that were related to the use of off-road vehicles occurred in the Province of Manitoba during the same period of time.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental aneurysmatic dilatation of the rabbit common carotid artery was induced by a single, periarterial application of calcium chloride in vivo. Vessels were fixed in situ after 3 d, 1 wk, 3 wk, 6 wk, and 12 wk by intracardiac perfusion of glutaraldehyde and tissues prepared for light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Progressive focal aneurysmal dilatation was seen limited to the site of calcium application with endothelial damage and thrombus formation in areas of irregular luminal contour. Disruption of the elastic network of the intima and media was seen with varying degrees of intimal fibromuscular hyperplasia and medial disorganization. The calcium-elastic tissue complex was the focus of the inflammatory, arteriosclerotic reaction and subsequent aneurysm formation. The inflammatory cell infiltration initially included primarily neutrophils followed by lymphocytes, plasma cells, monocytes, and multinucleated giant cells. These studies support the hypothesis that disruption of the elastic tissue network of the vascular wall represents an important pathogenetic factor in the initiation of aneurysmal dilatation. In addition, the results of these studies suggest that interaction of calcium with the elastica of the arterial wall may represent an important pathogenetic factor in the initiation of giant cell arteritis.\r"

  ".U": "88139769\r", 
  ".W": "To assess effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on ventricular tachycardia (VT) of various mechanisms, electrophysiology studies were performed before and after intravenous infusion of propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) in 33 patients with chronic recurrent VT, who had previously been tested with intravenous verapamil (0.15 mg/kg followed by 0.005 mg/kg/min infusion). In the verapamil-irresponsive group, 10 patients (group IA) had VT that could be initiated by programmed ventricular extrastimulation and terminated by overdrive ventricular pacing, and 11 patients (group IB) had VT that could be provoked by isoproterenol infusion (3-8 micrograms/min) but not by programmed electrical stimulation, and that could not be converted to a sustained sinus rhythm by overdrive ventricular pacing. Notably, in the group IA patients, all 10 patients had structural heart disease (coronary arteriosclerosis or idiopathic cardiomyopathy); beta-adrenergic blockade accelerated the VT rate in one patient but exerted no effects on the VT rate in the remaining 9 patients, and VT remained inducible in all 10 patients. By contrast, in the group IB patients, 7 of the 11 patients had no apparent structural heart disease; beta-adrenergic blockade completely suppressed the VT inducibility during isoproterenol infusion in all 11 patients. There were 12 patients with verapamil-responsive VT (group II). 11 of the 12 patients had no apparent structural heart disease. In these patients, the initiation of VT was related to attaining a critical range of cycle lengths during sinus, atrial-paced or ventricular-paced rhythm; beta-adrenergic blockade could only slow the VT rate without suppressing its inducibility. Of note, 14 of the total 33 patients had exercise provocable VT: two in group IA, five in group IB, and seven in group II. Thus, mechanisms of VT vary among patients, and so do their pharmacologic responses. Although reentry, catecholamine-sensitive automaticity, and triggered activity related to delayed afterdepolarizations are merely speculative, results of this study indicate that beta-adrenergic blockade is only specifically effective in a subset group (group IB) of patients with VT suggestive of catecholamine-sensitive automaticity.\r"

  ".W": "Lipid metabolism was studied in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with the inherited disorder, Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS). Intact SLS fibroblasts incubated in the presence of [1-14C]palmitate accumulated more radioactive hexadecanol than did normal cells, whereas incorporation of radioactivity into other cellular lipids was unaltered. The hexadecanol content of SLS fibroblasts was abnormally elevated. Hexadecanol accumulation was not due to increased fatty alcohol synthesis nor its deficient utilization for glycerol ether synthesis. The half-life of intracellular hexadecanol loaded into SLS fibroblasts was increased (70 min) compared with normal (15 min), and intact SLS fibroblasts showed impaired oxidation of [14C]-hexadecanol to fatty acid. Fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase, the enzyme catalyzing this reaction, was deficient in SLS fibroblasts. Mean total activity in SLS fibroblasts (n = 5) was 13% of that in normal fibroblasts, and palmitoyl CoA-inhibitable activity was 1% of normal. Fibroblasts from two obligate SLS heterozygotes had enzyme activities intermediate between that in normal fibroblasts and individuals with SLS. These results suggest that the primary defect in SLS is deficiency of fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase. SLS represents the first inherited disorder in man associated with an isolated abnormality in fatty alcohol metabolism.\r"

Enhanced superoxide anion production was evident by 5 min and had reached a plateau by 15 min. Not only was the total amount of superoxide anion released greater, but the rate of release was also enhanced threefold by rH TNF-alpha. In contrast, rH TNF-alpha reduced or abolished neutrophil locomotion under agarose in response to a gradient of FMLP. Binding studies of f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe to purified human neutrophils revealed a heterogeneous binding to unstimulated cells. The high affinity component consisted of approximately 2,000 sites per cell and had an average Kd of 2 +/- 0.7 nM (n = 4). The low affinity component consisted of approximately 40,000 sites per cell and had an average Kd of 180 +/- 50 nM (n = 4). rH TNF-alpha caused conversion to a linear Scatchard plot showing no significant change in total binding sites but a single Kd of 40 +/- 10 nM (n = 4). These data indicate that rH TNF-alpha may influence neutrophil responses to FMLP by regulating the affinity of FMLP receptors.\r"

  ".U": "88139779\r", 
  ".W": "The experimental metastasis of B16-F10 murine melanoma cells is blocked by the anti-cell adhesive pentapeptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) derived from the central cell-binding domain of fibronectin. In this report, we show that peptide treatment substantially extends the survival time for mice injected intravenously with B16-F10 cells (8/8 vs. 0/8 mice alive at 150 d), thereby demonstrating the potential efficacy of GRGDS treatment in protection against metastatic colonization. We have also examined the specificity of GRGDS activity by testing a series of related homologues for their effects on experimental metastasis. The overall profile of the relative inhibitory activities of these peptides closely matched their previously established capacity to disrupt adhesion in vitro. Lung retention studies with radiolabeled B16-F10 cells revealed an accelerated rate of cell loss from the lung 0-6 h after coinjection with the active peptide GRGDS. This early effect of GRGDS was consistent with its short circulatory half-life, which was found to be 8 min. Taken together, these results suggest that peptide-mediated inhibition of pulmonary colonization is due to interference with B16-F10 cell adhesion to structures in the target organ. Possible peptide interference in tumor cell-blood cell interactions was examined in order to assess (a) possible biological side-effects of peptide treatment and (b) whether such interactions might be an alternative mechanism for GRGDS-mediated inhibition of pulmonary colonization. GRGDS was found to retain full inhibitory activity when coinjected with B16-F10 cells into mice in which platelet function was impaired by acetylsalicylic acid treatment or into thrombocytopenic mice treated with antiplatelet serum (76-93% inhibition of colony formation). These data suggest that platelet involvement in the effects of the peptide is minimal. Similarly, GRGDS was also found to be a potent inhibitor of experimental metastasis in natural killer (NK) cell-deficient beige mice (86% inhibition), thereby discounting the possibility that GRGDS artifactually enhanced NK cell activity. We conclude as a result of these studies that cell-binding fibronectin peptides are specific inhibitors of experimental metastasis that prolong survival, that they appear to function by blocking the adhesion of B16-F10 cells to structures in the target organ, and that they do not appear to act through side effects on certain metastasis-related blood cell functions. In the future, derivatives of fibronectin peptides may be potentially useful prophylactic agents for interfering with the process of metastasis.\r"

Eight women underwent a 2-h infusion of hypertonic saline before conception, during gestational weeks 5-8, 10-12, and 28-33, and then 10-12 wk postpartum. Basal plasma osmolality (Posmol) was already significantly decreased by 5-8 wk (P less than 0.001) and remained 10 mosmol.kg-1 below nonpregnant values throughout pregnancy. The apparent threshold for AVP release (defined as the abscissal intercept of the regression line relating plasma AVP [PAVP] to Posmol) was also decreased significantly throughout gestation, as was the osmotic threshold for thirst (derived from analogue scales relating desire to drink to Posmol). The decrement in osmotic thirst threshold appeared to precede that for AVP release, and consistent with this 24-h urine volumes were significantly greater at 5-8 wk gestation (P less than 0.05). The slopes of each regression equation defining PAVP vs. Posmol (whose r values ranged from 0.79 to 0.99), very reproducible before and after pregnancy, were similar at 5-8 and 10-12 wk, but were markedly reduced in the third trimester (P less than 0.001). These volunteers had randomly undergone an additional infusion before conception (both tests in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle) when 10,000 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) had been given intramuscularly over a 5-d period. Serum hCG values between 0.2 and 3.3 U.ml-1 were lower than usually seen in pregnancy, but the osmotic thresholds for AVP release and thirst decreased by 3 and 4 mosmol.kg-1, respectively (P less than 0.05). Finally we studied a patient with a molar pregnancy in whom thresholds for hormone release and thirst were both decreased to values resembling normal gestation and remained so for approximately 6 wk postevacuation, only normalizing when hCG had virtually disappeared from her serum. In contrast, thresholds increased within the first two puerperal weeks in two women with normal pregnancies. These data demonstrate (a) osmotic thresholds for both AVP release and thirst decrease within the very first gestational weeks; (b) increment in PAVP per unit increase in Posmol is reduced late in gestation; and (c) hCG may be involved in the osmoregulatory changes of pregnancy.\r"

To identify proteins in normal human skin recognized by PV antibodies, we performed immunoprecipitations of normal human epidermal extracts. All 22 PV sera tested immunoprecipitated a complex of polypeptides (PV complex) of 210,000, 130,000, and 85,000 mol wt, after reduction. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that the 130,000- and 85,000-mol-wt polypeptides of the PV antigen from both cultured keratinocytes and epidermis have identical charges and sizes. In addition to precipitating the PV complex, 14 of 22 PV sera also have antibodies to a calcium-sensitive epitope on a different complex of polypeptides (PF complex) which has previously been shown to be precipitated by all pemphigus foliaceus (PF) sera. The PF complex consists of polypeptides of 260,000, 160,000, 110,000, and 85,000 mol wt. Although the majority of PV sera also precipitate the PF complex, no PF sera precipitate the PV complex. Thus, PV and PF can be absolutely distinguished on a molecular level using the patients' autoantibodies. The PV and PF complexes, although distinct, have certain similarities. The 85,000-mol-wt polypeptide of each is identical. The 160,000-mol wt-peptide of the PF complex and the 130,000-mol-wt peptide of the PV complex have the same isoelectric point and both are capable of disulfide linkage to the 85,000-mol-wt polypeptide. The PV and PF complexes are closely related and may prove important in cell adhesion.\r"

We attempted to establish such a relationship by determining whether the presence or absence of adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity (ACSA) in the media of cultured tumor cells predicted the occurrence of the syndrome of HHM when these cell lines were grown in nude mice in vivo. Conditioned media from 35 human renal carcinoma cell lines were surveyed for ACSA in the PTH-sensitive rat osteosarcoma 17/2.8 cell assay. 12 lines were positive (mean, 13.7-fold stimulation, range, 3.0 to 44.0), and 23 lines were negative (mean, 1.2-fold stimulation, range, 0.9 to 1.5). We were successful in establishing five of the positive and six of the negative lines in three to five nude mice per line. Mice implanted with the positive lines uniformly became hypercalcemic (mean serum calcium, 15.8 mg/dl), whereas mice implanted with the negative lines uniformly remained normocalcemic (mean serum calcium, 9.5 mg/dl), in spite of comparable mean tumor size. Acid-urea tumor extracts from each of four hypercalcemic animals contained potent in vitro ACSA (mean, 15.9-fold stimulation), while 5/5 extracts from normocalcemic animals did not (mean, 1.4-fold stimulation). Our study demonstrates that in this model system in vitro ACSA is a reliable predictive marker for HHM in vivo. Whether the protein responsible for this activity is also the mediator of the bone resorption seen in HHM remains to be demonstrated.\r"

Jejunal loops were perfused with isoosmotic, neutral Krebs buffer containing protease inhibitors. After basal sampling, the dogs received a high fat meat meal. Collections were made during the meal and for 60 min postprandially. Luminal met-enkephalin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay and confirmed by HPLC. HPLC separation of luminal samples demonstrated two immunoreactive peaks which co-eluted with pure met-enkephalin and met-enkephalin-sulfoxide. Basal met-enkephalin outputs averaged 52 +/- 13 ng/min. The meal significantly increased mean luminal met-enkephalin output to 137 +/- 71 ng/min. During the initial 20-min postprandial period, output remained elevated (180 +/- 73 ng/min), after which it returned to basal levels. We conclude that met-enkephalin is present in the jejunal lumen, and that luminal release of this opioid is augmented by a meal.\r"

The second protein (SP 9) migrated at approximately 9,000 D in the presence or absence of reducing agents. Both proteins contain a high number of hydrophobic amino acids. The NH2-terminal sequence of SP 18 was determined to be: NH2-phe-pro-ile-pro-leu-pro-tyr-. A cDNA clone isolated from a human adult lung cDNA library contained a long open reading frame encoding at an internal position the human SP 18 amino-terminal sequence. Mixtures of phospholipids (PL) and SP 9 and SP 18 were assessed for their capacity to reduce surface tensions on a pulsating bubble surfactometer. The addition of 1% apoprotein resulted in a reduction of surface tension after 15 s from 42.9 dyn/cm for PL alone to 16.7 and 6.3 dyn/cm for preparations containing SP 9 and SP 18, respectively. In vivo assessment of reconstituted surfactant activity was performed in fetal rabbits. Reconstituted surfactant consisting of PL + 0.5% SP 18 instilled intratracheally at delivery resulted in a marked increase in lung compliance, while the incorporation of 0.5% SP 9 yielded a moderate increase. These data show the ability to produce biologically active surfactant by the addition of isolated LMW apoproteins to defined PL.\r"
