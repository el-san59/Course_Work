  ".W": "Progesterone acts bimodally at the hypothalamus and at the pituitary gland, the sequelae in vivo being either stimulation or inhibition of gonadotropin secretion depending on a host of preconditions. Pituitary cells in culture were studied to characterize the acute action of progesterone on LH secretion. Preliminary studies established that anterior pituitary cells from adult female rats cultured for three days in 10% charcoal treated fetal bovine serum (c/t FBS) resulted in LH secretory responses to GnRH pulses which were half that for cells cultured in untreated FBS or c/t FBS + 0.2 nM 17 beta-estradiol (E2). Under standardized culture conditions (c/t FBS + E2), GnRH self-potentiation was evident. With this system, 90 min exposure to 200 nM progesterone resulted in a 3-fold augmentation of GnRH-stimulated LH secretion without affecting baseline LH. This action was manifested by 45 but not 15 min of progesterone exposure and was inhibited by simultaneous addition of cycloheximide. The augmentation of agonist-stimulated LH release could be elicited up to 4-5 h after progesterone addition. The estimated half-maximal effect was 10(-9) M, and this concentration of progesterone required E2-pretreatment of the cultured cells. In summary, addition of progesterone to cultured anterior pituitary cells pretreated with E2 leads to a concentration-, time-, and protein synthesis-dependent augmentation of pulsatile GnRH-stimulated LH secretion within 45 min of progesterone exposure. This rapid and unambiguous progesterone action in pituitary cells could function in vivo to define the final magnitude of the preovulatory LH surge.\r"

  ".W": "The hormonal control of the adipose conversion of 3T3 L1 cells was studied in a chemically defined medium and compared to that under serum-containing conditions. Addition of insulin to a chemically defined medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium-Ham's F-12, 1:1) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in glycero-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, a lipogenic marker enzyme. The maximally effective concentration of insulin was in the range of 10(-8) and 10(-7) mol/liter. Glucocorticoids were ineffective in the absence of insulin and exhibited an inhibitory action in serum-containing medium. In the presence of insulin, corticosterone and other glucocorticoids showed a potent adipogenic activity, with a maximally effective concentration at 10(-8) mol/l. 1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX), a cAMP-elevating agent, was also found to induce the adipose differentiation process in the presence of insulin. The effect of MIX could be partly replaced by (Bu)2cAMP. A combination of insulin and, for the first 2 days, glucocorticoids and MIX promoted a complete conversion of 3T3 cells within 6-8 days. The concentrations of the factors required for adipose conversion were substantially lower than those in serum-containing medium. The adipose conversion in serum-free medium was associated with an increase in cell number, since 0.3 micrograms/ml cytosin arabinoside not only inhibited cell replication, but also prevented the expression of glycero-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Our results demonstrate a complete adipose differentiation of 3T3 L1 cells in a chemically defined culture system supplemented with insulin, glucocorticoids, and factors that increase the cAMP content of the cells. This system may provide an improved model to study adipogenic and antiadipogenic factors under defined conditions.\r"

  ".U": "90322933\r", 
  ".W": "In the male rat the timing of puberty can be estimated by the rapid increase in testicular weight occurring between 25-50 days of age. We found that elongated spermatids, the most mature germ cells identified using flow cytometry, were first seen at 25 days (4% of the testicular cells), while an adult proportion (63%) was attained by 45 days of age. We have shown previously that hypothalamic explants could release GnRH in a pulsatile fashion at a frequency increasing around the age of 25 days, thus consistent with the time of onset of puberty. Since pulsatile GnRH secretion could be suppressed by MK-801, a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, we postulated that an increased activation of those receptors could be involved in the neuroendocrine mechanism that activates pulsatile GnRH secretion at the onset of puberty. Such a concept was supported by the NMDA-induced release of GnRH, which was observed using 1 mM NMDA at 25 days, while a dose of 20-50 mM was required at 15 or 50 days of age. MK-801 could provide an index of NMDA receptor activation, since the antagonistic effect of MK-801 is use dependent. This particular property was confirmed by the inability of MK-801 (5 pM) to block the depolarization (veratridine)-induced release of GnRH in the presence of 0.001 mM NMDA, while partial or complete suppression was obtained in the presence of 0.1 and 10 mM NMDA, respectively. Using explants obtained at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 50 days of age, the lowest concentrations of MK-801 that blocked the veratridine-induced release of GnRH were, respectively, 10(7), 10(7), 10(7), 10(3), 10, 10(2), 10(4), and 10(8) pM. In contrast, there was no age-related difference in sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of Mg2+, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist which is not use dependent. The pulsatile secretion of GnRH occurred at a similar frequency at 25 and 50 days of age (4.7 and 5.4 pulses/3.5 h, respectively) but it was suppressed by a lower MK-801 concentration at 25 days (10(4) pM) than at 50 days (10(8) pM). These data indicate that the NMDA receptors involved in the control of pulsatile GnRH secretion are markedly and transiently activated around the time of onset of puberty in the male rat.\r"

In the present work we examined whether a newly described secreted vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is expressed in normal rat ovary by in situ hybridization. Our results demonstrate the expression of VEGF in the CL but not in mural granulosa cells, suggesting a temporal relation between VEGF expression and growth of capillary vessels. The hybridization pattern in the CL was consistent with localization of VEGF message to luteal cells. Expression of VEGF was detected also in cumulus oophorus cells. These findings suggest that VEGF is involved in the process of CL angiogenesis.\r"

Histological and functional studies revealed there was no damage to the islets.

  ".W": "In long-term diabetes mellitus, thickening of basement membrane in capillaries and small vessels is a characteristic lesion and plays an important role in the progression of diabetic microangiopathy. We have developed a sandwich enzyme immunoassay for human serum type IV collagen peptide with monoclonal antibodies. Previous studies suggested that collagen levels reflect the activity of fibrogenesis in basement membrane. Serum type IV collagen levels were measured in 137 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients (aged 50-75 yr) with or without clinical signs of retinopathy, nephropathy, and/or neuropathy and 110 healthy subjects (aged 50-75 yr) without serological abnormality. Serum concentrations of type IV collagen were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in diabetic patients (mean +/- SE 124.1 +/- 4.1 ng/ml) than in healthy subjects (73.9 +/- 2.2 ng/ml) and were increased with the prevalence or incidence of diabetic complications. In the patients with diabetic microangiopathy, serum type IV collagen levels became higher as clinical signs worsened. Especially in the patients with diabetic nephropathy, serum type IV collagen levels became higher with elevation of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum beta 2-microglobulin but not urinary excretion of beta 2-microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. These observations indicated that elevation of serum type IV collagen in diabetic nephropathy was related to glomerular filtration dysfunction rather than renal tubular dysfunction. However, the antigen, which can be detected by our assay system, did not exist in urine specimens of healthy subjects, and an intimate relationship was not observed between serum type IV collagen level and serum creatinine level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Representative longitudinal muscle strips (6 x 10 mm) from distal small intestine were obtained from rats after 1, 2, and 3 mo of streptozocin-induced diabetes. The strips were stretched to their optimum lengths and subjected to electrical field stimulation (1-ms pulse duration, 30-270 mA, 10 Hz) in the presence of Krebs solution and Krebs solution plus 10(-6) M atropine. Field stimulation produced atropine-sensitive and atropine-resistant contractions in all strips. After 1 mo, significant differences in the amplitudes of the atropine-sensitive contractions were found between the diabetic rats and nondiabetic controls. Insulin-treated diabetic rats showed contraction responses that were intermediate in amplitude. After 2 mo, the difference between the control and diabetic groups was less evident but still significant. After 3 mo, the previously noted difference in the atropine-sensitive contractions between the diabetic and control groups had resolved. No significant differences among the three groups were noted in the amplitudes of the atropine-resistant contractions. Field stimulation delivered at pulse durations of 50 ms in the presence of neural blockade with tetrodotoxin (5 x 10(-6) M) produced similar contraction amplitudes among the three groups at any respective time phase of the study. Dose-response studies of intestinal muscle after 3 mo of untreated diabetes showed normal tension development to both bethanechol chloride and physostigmine. These results indicate that streptozocin-induced diabetes is acutely associated with defective cholinergic neuromuscular transmission in the myenteric plexus of the distal small intestine. The abnormality is less evident after 2 mo of untreated diabetes and resolves spontaneously after 3 mo. Insulin treatment appears to accelerate this resolution.\r"

Because the clinical onset of IDDM occurs only after most insulin-secreting beta-cells have been destroyed, we tested whether prophylactic insulin therapy might prevent IDDM in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. One hundred fourteen NOD mice were randomized at weaning into a protamine zinc pork insulin-treated (I) group or a placebo-treated (P) group given insulin diluent. All insulin treatments were adjusted to the maximum tolerable dosages and continued until 180 days of age. The cumulative IDDM frequency within the female I group was significantly less (3 of 34, 8%) than in female P controls (17 of 26, 65%; P less than 0.0001). This beneficial effect was limited to females, however, because the frequency of IDDM in male I mice (3 of 32, 9%) was not significantly different from the frequency in male P controls (1 of 22, 5%; P less than 0.5). Pancreatic histological examinations of nondiabetic animals revealed that insulin treatment resulted in significant reductions in islet cell inflammation and damage and improvements in insulin content. In summary, NOD mice given insulin therapy from weaning until 180 days of age had significantly lower frequencies of diabetes and pancreatic insulitis than sex-matched control littermates treated with insulin diluent. These results suggest that prophylactic insulin therapy to prevent IDDM in humans should be considered for clinical trials.\r"

Rats were injected with STZ (50 mg/kg) or vehicle and then either started immediately on insulin (continuous) or allowed to remain untreated for 4 wk before insulin replacement was started (delayed). Replacement consisted of 5 IU/kg of insulin injected just before the lights were turned off and 2 IU/kg of insulin injected within 1 h of the lights being turned on. Copulatory behavior was tested 2, 4, 5, and 6 wk after induction of diabetes. Forty-five days after STZ administration, rats were killed for measurement of plasma hormone levels and hypothalamic catecholamine turnover and serotonin content. The STZ-D rats showed significant deficits in mount, intromission, and ejaculatory behaviors that were prevented by continuous insulin replacement. Delayed insulin replacement reversed the deficits in mount and intromission behaviors but not ejaculatory behavior. Plasma luteinizing hormone levels were unaffected by STZ or insulin treatment, but plasma testosterone and prolactin levels were both reduced in the diabetic animals. Continuous or delayed insulin replacement normalized both testosterone and prolactin levels. Median eminence, medial basal hypothalamus, anterior hypothalamus, and olfactory bulb rates of norepinephrine turnover were all reduced after STZ administration. Delayed insulin replacement restored norepinephrine turnover in all brain regions, whereas continuous insulin replacement enhanced norepinephrine turnover in the anterior hypothalamus and olfactory bulb but only partially blocked the effects of STZ in the median eminence and medial basal hypothalamus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To measure leg glucose uptake, the femoral artery and vein were catheterized, and blood flow was measured by thermodilution (leg glucose uptake = arteriovenous glucose difference [A-VG] x blood flow).

To examine this, we used the glucose-clamp technique to measure whole-body and leg muscle glucose uptake in seven lean and six obese men during hyperinsulinemia (approximately 2000 pM) at four glucose levels (approximately 4.5, approximately 8.3, approximately 13.5, and approximately 23.5 mM). To measure leg glucose uptake, the femoral artery and vein were catheterized, and blood flow was measured by thermodilution (leg glucose uptake = arteriovenous glucose difference x blood flow). With this approach, we found that rates of whole-body and leg glucose uptake were significantly lower in obese than in lean subjects at each glucose plateau. Leg blood flow rates increased from 4.3 +/- 0.4 to 6.5 +/- 0.8 dl/min over the range of glucose in lean subjects (P less than 0.05) but remained unchanged in obese subjects. The apparent maximal capacity (Vmax), based on whole-body and leg glucose uptake, was reduced in obese compared with lean subjects, but the apparent Km was similar in the lean and obese subjects (6-9 mM, NS). To assess the affinity of muscle for glucose extraction independent of changes in muscle plasma flow, we determined the mean half-maximal effective glucose concentration (EG50) and found it was similar in the lean and obese subjects (6.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 6.0 +/- 0.8 mM, NS). We conclude that 1) the kinetics of in vivo insulin-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle in human obesity are characterized by reduced Vmax but normal Km; 2) the EG50 for insulin-mediated glucose extraction in skeletal muscle was 6 mM in both lean and obese subjects, consistent with a Km characteristic of the glucose-transport system; 3) obese subjects were unable to generate increases in blood flow in response to hyperglycemia under hyperinsulinemic conditions, and this contributed significantly to lower rates of leg and whole-body glucose uptake.\r"

  ".W": "Results of studies on the effects of exogenous galanin on islet cell secretion are controversial. Until recently, only pig galanin has been available, and structural dissimilarities among the galanin molecules of different species might have contributed to discrepancies among the study results. Thus, we investigated the influence of synthetic rat galanin (50 nM) on unstimulated insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin release and on the responses of these hormones to arginine (10 mM), glucose (16.6 mM), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP; 1 nM) in a homologous animal model, the perfused rat pancreas. In addition, the effect of an equimolar concentration of pig galanin on arginine-induced islet cell secretion was examined. Infusion of rat galanin reduced unstimulated insulin release (approximately 60%, P less than 0.01) and the insulin responses to arginine (approximately 30%, P less than 0.025), glucose (100%, P less than 0.01), and VIP (approximately 80%, P less than 0.025). Galanin also inhibited unstimulated somatostatin secretion (approximately 15%, P less than 0.05) and virtually abolished the somatostatin output evoked by arginine, glucose, and VIP. Conversely, rat galanin increased unstimulated glucagon output (approximately 20%, P less than 0.05), potentiated the glucagon response to arginine (approximately 50%, P less than 0.05) and VIP (approximately 90%, P less than 0.05), and counteracted the suppressor effect of glucose on alpha-cell secretion. Pig galanin inhibited the insulin output elicited by arginine (approximately 45%, P less than 0.05) but did not affect the somatostatin and glucagon responses to the aminogenic stimulus. In conclusion, the opposite effects of galanin on insulin and glucagon secretion favor the concept of galanin as a diabetogenic agent. Galanin also behaves as a potent inhibitor of somatostatin release. Finally, the importance of using homologous galanin to study the biological activity of this peptide must be emphasized.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate prophylactic surgery for esophageal varices, a prospective randomized controlled trial was begun in 1980 by the Japanese Research Society for Portal Hypertension. Methods of operation included selective shunts and nonshunting interruption procedures. One hundred and twelve Japanese patients, in whom endoscopic findings suggested risk of bleeding but who had no bleeding episode, were randomly allocated to the operated group of 60 patients or nonoperated group of 52 patients. Nine patients with idiopathic portal hypertension, histologically proven noncirrhotic disease, which all fell in the operated group, were excluded from the study and the remaining 103 patients (51 operated and 52 nonoperated) were analyzed. Long-term follow-up of patients for a median of 49 mo with a maximum of 73 mo showed a total of 11 (22%) deaths, including 2 operative deaths, in the operated group compared with 23 (49%) deaths in the nonoperated group. The cumulative survival rate at 5 yr in the operated group was 72%, which was significantly higher than the 45% of the nonoperated group (p less than 0.05). The cumulative variceal bleeding rate at 5 yr was 7% in the operated group, which was significantly lower than that of the nonoperated group of 46% (p less than 0.001). It was concluded that portal nondecompression surgery was effective in preventing the variceal bleeding and in improving survival.\r"

A total of 108 liver biopsy specimens from 20 patients with a diagnosis of cytomegalovirus hepatitis (obtained per protocol at 7, 21, 90, and 180 days or whenever liver dysfunction occurred), which had previously been examined histologically and in cell culture, were again studied by recutting the liver tissue for histological examination, DNA hybridization and immunostaining with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to cytomegalovirus. In 5 of 20 patients, the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus hepatitis could have been made earlier (mean = 9.6 days) by immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody. Of 47 biopsy specimens with cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies, the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic procedures were immunostaining with monoclonal antibody (84% and 90%) and polyclonal antibody (72% and 97%), in situ DNA hybridization (72% and 100%) and cell culture detection (52% and 95%), respectively. Immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody against an early CMV antigen frequently detected cytomegalovirus infection in the liver allograft earlier than identification of typical histological inclusion bodies. DNA in situ hybridization was less sensitive than other techniques but highly specific; cytomegalovirus cell culture lacked sensitivity compared with the other procedures.\r"

  ".W": "The onset of sodium retention in the phenobarbital and carbon tetrachloride model of cirrhosis in the rat is preceded by a linear decrease in hepatic function as measured by the aminopyrine breath test. Sodium retention occurs when liver function decreases below a critical threshold. Changes in systemic hemodynamics may be responsible for initiating the development of renal sodium retention. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between hepatic function and systemic and renal hemodynamics of experimental cirrhosis in rats maintained on a constant salt diet. Cirrhosis was induced in phenobarbital-treated rats by weekly administration of carbon tetrachloride. The aminopyrine breath test served as a measure of hepatic function. Three groups of animals were studied to evaluate the contribution of changes in systemic and renal hemodynamics to the onset of sodium retention: a group with sodium retention and aminopyrine breath test results just below the critical threshold, a group without sodium retention and aminopyrine breath test results just above the critical threshold and a phenobarbital-treated control group. In each group, urinary sodium excretion, renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, mean arterial pressure and arterial and renal venous plasma renin activities were determined. A progressive, significant reduction in mean arterial pressure was seen, comparing controls with the other two groups. No differences in renal plasma flow were observed between the three groups, but glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction were slightly reduced in the sodium-retaining group compared with the non-retaining group and controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, the topographical relationship between the display of HBcAg on one hand and the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by hepatocytes on the other was analyzed with a double-staining immunohistochemical procedure in 14 selected liver biopsy samples showing chronic persistent or chronic active hepatitis and signs of active hepatitis B virus replication as reflected by the presence of variable amounts of HBcAg in a nuclear or cytoplasmic pattern of immunoreactivity. Coexpression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and human leukocyte antigen-DR antigens by hepatocytes correlated positively with the site and extent of the inflammatory infiltrate, which was composed of lymphocytes expressing lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1. In healthy HBsAg-positive carriers without inflammatory liver disease, no intercellular adhesion molecule-1 or human leukocyte antigen-DR expression was found on hepatocytes; in acute hepatitis, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and human leukocyte antigen-DR were strongly expressed throughout the liver parenchyma on liver cell membranes and on sinusoidal lining cells. In chronic persistent and chronic active hepatitis and in active cirrhosis, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and human leukocyte antigen-DR showed membranous positivity on focal clusters of hepatocytes in areas of periportal or intraacinar inflammation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It remains unclear whether atypical epithelial lesions, including carcinomas and precancerous lesions, develop in intraheptic peribiliary glands. This question was tested in this study. One thousand livers from consecutive autopsies were surveyed and 201 livers with bile duct carcinomas or metastatic malignant neoplasms were excluded because atypical epithelial lesions of the glands were difficult to distinguish from the primary or metastatic malignant cells. Consequently, 799 livers were examined for the atypical epithelial lesions by histological, mucin-histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. The atypical epithelial lesions were divisible into papillary hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia and carcinomatous transformation. Of the 799 livers, papillary hyperplasia was only found in six livers (0.8%), papillary hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia coexisted in four livers (0.5%) and carcinomatous transformation and atypical hyperplasia coexisted in one liver (0.1%). Mucin-histochemical study showed that the intracytoplasmic location of mucin was different between carcinomatous transformation and normal peribiliary glands. From an immunohistochemical standpoint, epithelial cells of the atypical epithelial lesions showed stronger immunoreactivities to carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and DU-PAN-2 than those of normal intrahepatic peribiliary glands. These findings suggest that intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas arising from intrahepatic peribiliary glands actually exist, and that papillary and atypical hyperplasia of the peribiliary glands may precede this type of cholangiocarcinoma.\r"

Questionnaire data were obtained on 88.5% of these patients. Twenty-nine percent of the patients were found to be asymptomatic. Geographical clustering and racial predisposition were not seen. No increase in breast cancer prevalence was noted. By the time the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis was established, the patients had consulted a median number of 3.5 physicians. Fatigue was reported as the most disabling symptom. The diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis in patients referred from across the province of Ontario was independently confirmed by us, using standard criteria (antimitochondrial antibody testing and liver biopsy), and was found to be reliable.\r"

Low-level (threshold) stimulation allows for the nearest populations of axons or neuronal cell bodies (in the vicinity of the electrode tip) to be activated in the safest possible fashion. When motor pathways are being tested, attention must be paid to the control and administration of muscle relaxant drugs, which can dampen or abolish muscle responsiveness during stimulation. Peripheral nerve conduction studies can be carried out intraoperatively and may be beneficial for assessing the physiological status of a section of traumatized nerve. Cortical mapping is valuable when surgical resections near motor or speech areas in the brain are contemplated and may help the surgeon avoid significant postoperative deficits in movement or language. Intraoperative stimulation for identifying spinal motor pathways may be used to guide surgical exploration. Finally, selective intraoperative stimulation for identifying nerve fibers encased in tumor may be useful for procedures involving difficult dissections along the brachial plexus or other major nerves in the arm or leg.\r"

Seven chronic uremics on regular HF were treated for 4 weeks, three times a week, with AN69 hemofilters. The study was then repeated with PS hemofilters. There were no significant differences in the patients' body weight, the ultrafiltrate volume per session, and the duration of each HF session between both treatments. At the start of HF, arterial plasma concentration of BMG was (for AN69) 33.5 +/- 4.0 mg/L (mean +/- SD) and (for PS) 35.8 +/- 6.5 mg/L (NS); at the end of HF it was (for AN69) 11.0 +/- 1.8 mg/L and (for PS) 17.5 +/- 4.2 mg/L (p less than 0.001). The amount of BMG in total ultrafiltrate was (for AN69) 179.3 +/- 22.6 mg and (for PS) 140.6 +/- 26.8 mg (p less than 0.02). With AN69 hemofilter, maximum BMG plasma clearance and sieving coefficient were 51.0 +/- 9.5 mL/min and 0.42 +/- 0.04 at 60 minutes. With PS hemofilter, maximum BMG plasma clearance and sieving coefficient were 37.4 +/- 5.7 mL/min and 0.27 +/- 0.03 at 15 minutes. Twenty-two percents of BMG entering the AN69 hemofilter at 15 minutes were adsorbed on the membrane (p less than 0.001). BMG elimination with the AN69 hemofilter was more efficient than with the PS hemofilter. Long-term studies will be necessary to demonstrate whether this difference is of any clinical significance.\r"

  ".W": "A multicenter clinical trial was initiated to test the potential safety and short-term efficacy of a percutaneous coronary application of laser balloon angioplasty, which has been shown experimentally to alleviate the common causes (dissection, recoil, thrombus) of suboptimal luminal results of conventional balloon angioplasty. Fifty-five patients, the majority (62%) of whom had relatively high risk lesions, were treated in 10 centers with a laser balloon that was identical in size (3 x 20 mm) to a balloon used for conventional balloon angioplasty performed on the same lesion immediately before laser balloon angioplasty. One or more neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) (1,060 nm) laser doses of 250 to 450 J were each delivered over a 20 s duration per exposure. Immediately and 1 day after laser balloon angioplasty no significant adverse effects on the arterial lumen were noted in any patient. By computerized image analysis of cineangiograms initial conventional balloon angioplasty failed to achieve a minimal luminal diameter greater than 1.5 mm in 14 patients (25%), including 3 patients with acute closure. However, after subsequent laser balloon angioplasty, minimal luminal diameter exceeded this value in all patients including this subgroup. Overall, minimal luminal diameter increased from 1.74 +/- 0.46 mm after conventional balloon angioplasty to 2.32 +/- 0.31 mm after laser balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001) with no change found on 1 day and 1 month follow-up angiograms. Thus, laser balloon angioplasty is a safe, effective procedure for improving luminal dimensions after conventional balloon angioplasty.\r"

Although earlier contrast agents required direct delivery into the coronary arteries or aortic root, a new echocardiographic contrast agent, sonicated albumin microspheres (Albunex), has been found to cross the pulmonary circulation in experimental models. To determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of intravenous injections of Albunex in humans, 71 patients at three independent medical institutions underwent two-dimensional echocardiographic examination before, during and after the administration of three intravenous doses of Albunex, ranging from 0.01 to 0.12 ml/kg body weight. All patients provided a complete history and underwent physical and neurologic examination and laboratory and electrocardiographic evaluation before the injections; all evaluations (except for the history) were repeated at 2 h and 3 days after the injections of Albunex. The efficacy of the injections was qualitatively assessed by two independent blinded observers using a grading system of 0 to +3, with 0 indicating an absence of contrast effect and +3 indicating full opacification of the cavities examined. All injections were well tolerated and no serious side effects were noted in any of the patients. Irrespective of dose group, a cavity opacification greater than or equal to +2 was seen in the right ventricle in 212 (88%) of 240 injections and in the left ventricle in 151 (63%) of 240 injections as judged by the independent observers. The degree of ventricular cavity opacification appeared to be dose and concentration related.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the relation between the risk of cardiac rupture and the timing of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. To test the hypothesis that cardiac rupture is prevented by early thrombolytic therapy but is promoted by late treatment, randomized controlled trials of thrombolytic agents for myocardial infarction were pooled. A logistic regression model including 58 cases of cardiac rupture among 1,638 patients from four trials showed that the odds ratio (treated/control) of cardiac rupture was directly correlated with time to treatment (p = 0.01); at 7 h, the odds ratio was 0.4 (95% confidence limits 0.17 to 0.93); at 11 h, it was 0.93 (0.53 to 1.60) and at 17 h, it was 3.21 (1.10 to 10.1). Analysis of data from the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI) trial independently confirmed the relation between time to thrombolytic therapy and risk of cardiac rupture (p = 0.03). Analysis of 4,692 deaths in 44,346 patients demonstrated that the odds ratio of death was also directly correlated with time to treatment (p = 0.006); at 3 h, the odds ratio for death was 0.72 (0.67 to 0.77); at 14 h, it was 0.88 (0.77 to 1.00) and at 21 h, it was 1 (0.82 to 1.37). Thrombolytic therapy early after acute myocardial infarction improves survival and decreases the risk of cardiac rupture. Late administration of thrombolytic therapy also appears to improve survival but may increase the risk of cardiac rupture.\r"

To evaluate the effects of 12 months of therapy with nifedipine, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in 72 asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation. At 12 months, patients receiving nifedipine had a significant reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (110 +/- 19 versus 136 +/- 22 ml/m2, p less than 0.01) and mass (115 +/- 19 versus 142 +/- 16 g/m2, p less than 0.01) measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. They also had a reduction in left ventricular mean wall stress (360 +/- 27 versus 479 +/- 36 kdyne/cm2, p less than 0.001) and an increase in ejection fraction (72 +/- 8% versus 60 +/- 6%, p less than 0.05). These data show that the long-term unloading action of nifedipine is able to reverse left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy and suggest that such therapy has the potential to delay the need for valve replacement in asymptomatic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Transesophageal echocardiography with a single plane (transverse axis), dedicated pediatric probe was performed prospectively in 25 anesthetized children undergoing routine cardiac catheterization or intracardiac surgery, to assess the potential role of this technique in the initial diagnosis, perioperative management and postoperative follow-up of children with congenital heart disease. The group ranged in age from 1 year to 14.8 years (mean 6.1) and weight from 6.5 to 52 kg (mean 22.4). Studies were successful in all patients and no complications were encountered. The results of the transesophageal studies (combined imaging, color flow mapping and pulsed wave Doppler sampling) were correlated both with the results of prior precordial studies and the information obtained at cardiac catheterization. Transesophageal echocardiography provided a more detailed evaluation of the morphology and function of systemic and pulmonary venous return, the atria, interatrial baffles, atrioventricular valves and the left ventricular outflow tract. Additional information was obtained in 15 patients (60%). Problem areas for single plane transesophageal imaging were the apical interventricular septum, the right ventricular outflow tract and the left pulmonary artery. The intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography allowed assessment of the surgical repair and monitoring of ventricular function and volume status while the patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Transesophageal echocardiography in pediatric patients is of additional value in three main areas: 1) the precise morphologic diagnosis of congenital heart disease, 2) perioperative monitoring, and 3) postsurgical follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "Clinicians have a difficult choice between the arterial switch (Jatene et al.) and the atrial baffle operation (Mustard or Senning) for transposition of the great arteries. The surgical decision is essentially a determination of whether the long-term course after the arterial switch procedure (thought to be more favorable than after the atrial baffle procedure) plus elimination of presurgical attrition with the atrial baffle is substantial enough to offset the higher early mortality rate associated with the arterial switch. Decision analysis was undertaken to answer the following questions: 1) are there clinical circumstances under which published surgical results support a clear procedure of choice in transposition of the great arteries? and 2) what short- and long-term outcomes must be anticipated for the arterial switch to compare favorably with the published experience with the atrial baffle? A decision tree was constructed accounting for the major variables influencing mortality and morbidity in the surgical management of transposition of the great arteries. Presuming that the arterial switch has moderate advantages over the atrial baffle in terms of late morbidity and mortality for simple transposition of the great arteries at an institution with average results from the atrial baffle, the early mortality rate of the arterial switch must be less than 24% to recommend the switch operation. Assuming extremely good surgical results from the atrial baffle, an early mortality rate of the arterial switch less than 20% is required to recommend the switch procedure over the atrial baffle operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A prospective, anonymous study of HIV and hepatitis B (HB) seroprevalence was performed on excess serum of all ED patients over two 48-hour periods in May and August, 1988, from 7 hospitals in the Portland metropolitan area. Demographics were known for 338/444 (76%) of patients. Forty-six percent were male, 85% white, with a median age group of 30-39 years. Ambulance transport, trauma, external blood, presentations requiring ED procedure(s), and acuity resulting in ICU admission were present on 21%, 7%, 10%, 34%, and 14% of patients, respectively. Two of 444 (.45%) patients were HIV +, one previously undiagnosed. Fifty-five of the 444 (12%) and 3 of 444 (0.6%) samples were positive for HBcAB and HBsAG respectively. Risk factor assessment was possible on 180/444 (40%) patients. HBcAB seroprevalence correlated with race (P less than 0.01), IV drug use (P less than 0.0001), and hospital location, (P less than 0.006) but were sensitive in detecting only 14%, 18%, and 38%, respectively, of HBcAB+ patients. HBcAB was not associated with the following factors: sex, area of residence, presence of blood externally, trauma, acuity of illness, ED procedures, or mode of transport. This data strongly support the use of universal body fluid precautions. Hepatitis B poses a significant and distinct risk to all emergency care providers. HB vaccination should be strongly advocated for all ED health care workers (HCWs). Emergency medicine multicenter studies are both desirable and feasible.\r"

Gastrointestinal decontamination is usually indicated in recent acute ingestions but may precipitate convulsions. Recovery from strychnine poisoning is usually complete and rapid if treatment is aggressive. In the absence of trauma, compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, or anoxic central nervous system injury, no neurologic or musculoskeletal sequelae are expected.

We showed previously that GM-CSF production by lectin or phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA]-treated T cells was unaffected by cyclosporin A whereas IL-2 and IL-3 expression were. Cyclosporin A is thought to inhibit transcription that suggests that IL-2 and IL-3 are regulated primarily at the transcriptional level while GM-CSF is not. The lack of coordinate gene expression is of particular interest because all three mRNA share the presence of adenosine uridine-rich sequences in the 3' untranslated region and these sequences are believed to act by modulating mRNA stability. We measured the level of GM-CSF mRNA in untreated cells and found it to be extremely low. GM-CSF mRNA levels increased approximately 60-fold within 6 h of TPA-treatment. Nuclear run-on transcription analysis of the same cells showed readily detectable GM-CSF transcription in unstimulated cells that increased less than twofold after TPA treatment. However, IL-2 transcription was insignificant before TPA addition. Actinomycin D chase experiments showed that GM-CSF transcripts in untreated cells have a very short half-life (approximately 45 min) although transcripts in TPA-treated cells have a half-life exceeding 3 h. These findings indicate that GM-CSF production in EL-4 cells treated with TPA is regulated predominantly by modulation of cytoplasmic mRNA half-life.\r"

Cultures of one NFS-60 subline, when switched from IL-3 to 10% L cell conditioned media, a source of M-CSF, or purified M-CSF, frequently acquired large, adherent cells. The adherent cells grew slowly in the presence of M-CSF, in contrast to the majority population of small, round, rapidly growing cells. The large cells had properties of differentiated macrophages that were absent in the nonadherent cells. Cells with macrophage phenotype were not observed in IL-3-supported cultures over many passages. A subline was derived from NFS-60 that grew rapidly and continuously in human or murine M-CSF as round, nonadherent cells. The line, called M-NFS-60, responded well to M-CSF and IL-3, weakly to granulocyte-CSF and not at all to murine granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IL-4, or human IL-1. A mAb to human M-CSF specifically inhibited only M-NFS-60 proliferation induced by the human growth factor, whether produced by mammalian or bacterial cells. This study shows two effects of M-CSF on the IL-3-dependent NFS-60 line. Upon first exposure to M-CSF, cells may undergo global differentiation to slowly replicating macrophages in conditions we have not been able to define. The more common effect is rapid growth of immature myeloid cells like the bone marrow precursors, but with a block to differentiation. Thus, these cells may be useful as models of M-CSF-induced differentiation, and of permanently maintained macrophage precursors.\r"

The source of the Ag was mainly membrane preparations obtained from MLC cells, from normal thymocytes, and from the plasmocytoma line LP-1. Membranes were solubilized in NP-40 and the extracts fractionated by immunoaffinity chromatography [using a specific anti-CD38 antibody (A10 mAb) covalently linked to Sepharose protein A]. The purified Ag migrated as a single chain of Mr = 45,000 not associated with beta 2-microglobulin. Two-dimensional IEF gel electrophoresis revealed five spots (isoelectric point (pI) range: 6.5 to 6.9). After neuraminidase treatment, the mobility of the five polypeptides shifted to a more basic pI. Endoglycosidase-H treatment reduced the Mr of CD38 by 20%, revealing a broader band centered at Mr = 36,000. Treatment of CD38 molecule with V8 Staphylococcus aureus protease yielded a single dominant band at Mr = 38,000 which was still reactive with A10 mAb. The CD38 molecular was trypsin-resistant in both denatured or native conditions. These results clearly show the glycoprotein nature of CD38 molecule, which includes 2 to 4 N-linked oligosaccharide chains containing sialic acid residues. Furthermore, the present data indicate that the CD38 molecule does not display an apparent biochemical polymorphism among the different CD38+ cells or lines.\r"

  ".W": "The TCR consists of at least seven transmembrane chains: the clonotypic disulfide-linked alpha- and beta-chains, the invariant gamma-, delta-, and epsilon-chains, termed the CD3 complex, and the zeta-zeta homodimer. We have recently described an additional 26-kDa protein, which is transiently associated with newly synthesized mouse CD3 chains in the endoplasmic reticulum. The exact function of this protein, which we called TRAP (for TCR-associated protein) is not yet known; studies suggest however, that it may play a role in the assembly of the TCR complex. Here we report the properties of another protein which has a Mr of 16,000 and, like TRAP, can be coimmunoprecipitated from metabolically labelled murine T cells with antibodies against the chains of the CD3 complex. Kinetic analysis suggests a precursor-product relationship between TRAP and the 16-kDa protein: the latter starts appearing once TRAP begin to disappear. Having reached a maximal level at approximately 1 h after biosynthesis, it is rapidly lost. Agents that slow or block the disappearance of TRAP, delay or prevent the appearance and eventual disappearance of the 16-kDa protein. Incubation of immunoprecipitates containing gamma, epsilon, and TRAP in vitro at 37 degrees C results in the appearance of the 16-kDa protein. Employing HPLC peptide mapping we demonstrate that this 16-kDa protein is structurally related to TRAP. These results suggest that the removal of TRAP from the newly synthesized CD3 chains is accompanied by its proteolytic cleavage in a pre-Golgi compartment.\r"

Serotype 1 was predominant in both years, particularly in the North and East; serotype 3 was second in frequency and found most often in the South; serotype 2 was detected only occasionally; serotypes 4, 8, and 9 were never found. Rotavirus strains were grouped into five major electropherotypes, each corresponded to a single serotype, and the relative migration of the gene segments 7-9 could be used to distinguish serotype 1 from serotype 3. The amplification typing technique proved to be of great value in typing the 17% of rotavirus-positive specimens untypable by the serologic technique.\r"

The 50% human infectious dose was 10(4.6) TCID50 for ah and 10(4.4) for ca vaccines. Both reassortants were satisfactorily attenuated with restricted replication and were no more reactogenic than placebo. The mean peak titer of virus shed was 10(1.5) (ah) to 10(2.0) (ca) TCID50/ml, and each of 37 isolates tested retained their characteristic vaccine phenotypes.

The reaction resulted in death within 1 h when the LPS was injected 2-10 h after the MDP injection. LPS prepared from other Bacteroides and Salmonella species but not from others, including Escherichia coli, could induce the reaction. LPS-nonresponsive C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6 and C57BL/10 strains were also responsive to the reaction, while AKR, BALB/c, DBA/2, and ICR mice were not. By contrast, Bacteroides LPS exhibited weak lethal toxicity compared with E. coli LPS in galactosamine-sensitized C3H/HeN mice, while neither LPS had activity in C3H/HeJ mice. LPS from E. coli and Bacteroides intermedius induced serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity in MDP-primed mice, except for C3H/HeJ mice; B. gingivalis LPS rarely induced TNF in C3H/HeN or C3H/HeJ mice, indicating no involvement of TNF in the anaphylactoid reaction. Serotonin could substitute for MDP for the reaction, and methysergide, a serotonin antagonist, inhibited the activity.\r"

Clone 20 given 1.5 h before the bacterial challenge protected mice from death (mortality at 48 h 3% vs. 87%, P less than .001). The pattern of IL-6 release was indistinguishable in clone 20 recipients and controls: The area under the curve (AUC) for 5 h was 1.22 +/- 0.07 x 10(6), 1.03 +/- 0.17 x 10(6), and 1.22 +/- 0.07 x 10(6) units/ml for clone 20, A1, and DMEM/FCS, respectively.

Evaluation of ceftazidime and cefotaxime minimum inhibitory concentrations for isogenic derivatives demonstrated a major role for TEM-12 in the decreased susceptibility observed.

TEM-12 appeared identical to TEM-101, an in vitro TEM derivative, in both isoelectric point (pI 5.25) and substrate profile.

Neither plasmid hybridized to probes for DHFR types I, II, or III.

Isoelectric focusing showed distinct isoelectric points for the enzymes coded for on pBH600 (5.3) and pBH700 (5.6-5.7). Trimethoprim-resistant S. sonnei from 10 locations in nine states were examined.

In an opsonophagocytic assay, selective blockade of the CR3 sugar or lectin-like binding site on adult or neonatal PMNL effected a significant reduction in killing of both GBS serotypes that was more pronounced for type III. In contrast, blockade of the iC3b binding site effected greater inhibition of bactericidal activity for type Ia than for type III GBS. When both the CR3 sugar or lectin-like binding site and CR1 were blocked, inhibition was enhanced for type Ia GBS by adult PMNL and for both serotypes by neonatal PMNL. These results demonstrate a role for both CR1 and CR3 in the opsonophagocytosis of GBS. Possibly, differences in CR3 epitope utilization contribute to the differential virulence among GBS serotypes in neonates.\r"

There was no difference in the ability to remain seropositive to tetanus toxoid between patients with and without chronic graft-versus-host disease. Of 21 patients immunized with one dose of tetanus toxoid 1 year after transplant, 14 were seronegative at the time of immunization (response rate, 64%). At 1 year after immunization, 7 remained seropositive. Ten patients were reimmunized with two doses of tetanus toxoid. All responded and 90% remained seropositive 1 year later. When 21 patients were primarily immunized with three doses of tetanus toxoid, all patients seronegative at immunization responded and all tested patients remained seropositive 2 years later. The immunization responses were significantly superior in patients receiving three doses compared with those who received one. Reimmunization with tetanus toxoid of long-term survivors after marrow transplant seems necessary. A three-dose immunization schedule is recommended to obtain an adequate immune response.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether Candida albicans in patients with AIDS represents a unique strain, C. albicans isolated from 24 patients with AIDS was compared with Candida isolated from 23 healthy adults. Resistance to 5-fluorocytosine, synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides, sugar use, and enzyme activity patterns were similar among isolates from the two groups. Molecular analysis revealed similar banding patterns of EcoRI restriction fragments of DNA between 2.5-3 and 6-7 kb. In addition, the frequency of a dimorphic 3.7-versus 4.2-kb band, identified by agarose gel electrophoresis and by probing Southern transfers of EcoRI digests with a cloned fragment of C. albicans DNA encoding 25S ribosomal RNA, was not significantly different between the AIDS-derived and control C. albicans. C. albicans isolated at different time points in the course of disease and from different sites in individual patients showed identical DNA fingerprints. The similarity in isolates of C. albicans that cause disease in AIDS patients and those present in healthy subjects suggests that the candidiasis associated with AIDS is not due to the presence of a unique or particularly virulent strain but is likely the consequence of a defect in host defense mechanisms.\r"

The results showed significantly elevated anti-mSP65 antibody levels in patients with oral or vulvovaginal candidiasis and in patients with Candida-infected lesions of lichen planus when compared with patients with noninfected lichen planus or recurrent oral ulceration and with matched healthy controls (P less than .001). Immunoblot analysis showed that the rabbit antiserum that strongly bound to mSP65 cross-reacted only weakly with a homologous band of a soluble C. albicans extract. Moreover, the binding of antibodies from patients with candidiasis to the mSP65 antigen was not inhibited in the presence of Candida extract. In view of the poor serologic cross-reactivity, it seems plausible that the recall stimulation of anti-mSP65-producing B cells could be induced by helper T cells that cross-react with the structurally homologous protein of C. albicans.\r"

Normal neutrophils were found to damage hyphae whereas neutrophils from patients with both chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) deficiency did not. Further, both azide and catalase + superoxide dismutase inhibited the ability of normal neutrophils to damage hyphae, suggesting that this damage is mediated by products of the respiratory burst and by the MPO-halide system. Also, mixtures of small numbers of normal neutrophils with larger numbers of CGD neutrophils (range, 1:5 to 1:15) damaged hyphae more efficiently than either population of cells alone. Further, mixtures of CGD and MPO-deficient neutrophils, neither of which alone could efficiently damage hyphae, were able to damage the hyphae almost as well as a comparable number of normal neutrophils. These data demonstrate that intact neutrophils can cooperate to synergistically damage Aspergillus hyphae, possibly by extracellular mixing of hydrogen peroxide and MPO.\r"

The quantitative levels of IgE and IgG responses (both polyclonal and O. volvulus-specific) remained essentially unchanged for all patients, but 9 of the 21 patients showed intensified responses to one or more parasite-specific antigens, and 8 of 21 developed antibodies to previously undetected antigens. There was a significant correlation between the intensities of infection and the development of newly recognized anti-O. volvulus antibodies. These studies demonstrate that O. volvulus-specific IgE and IgG antibody responses are, at least transiently, enhanced by treatment with diethylcarbamazine and that after treatment, parasites possibly release antigens previously hidden from the host's immune response.\r"

None of 22 volunteers who received strain 57-1 or of 21 who received strain C1845 developed symptoms of diarrhea as defined for this study. All volunteers shed the challenge DA E. coli in their stools. Duodenal string cultures were positive in some volunteers only at the highest doses. Only 6 developed IgG or IgA antibodies to whole DA E. coli. Thus, the pathogenic potential of DA E. coli could not be shown in this model. Further studies are needed to characterize potential virulence factors of DA E. coli that might distinguish a pathogenic subset.\r"

The culture-positive group was more likely to have had bloody diarrhea and fecal leukocytes and to have received transfusions than the culture-negative group but was otherwise similar in clinical characteristics. E. coli O157:H7 is the predominant pathogen associated with HUS in western Washington. Recovery of this pathogen is highly dependent on obtaining stool cultures within 6 days of onset of diarrhea.\r"

No Herxheimer-like reactions were observed, although 78% of patients had at least one positive LAL. Serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, and white blood cell counts were significantly higher (P less than .01) in simultaneously drawn LAL-positive specimens than in negative ones. Delayed hepatic clearance of endotoxin due to liver dysfunction may explain the high LAL positivity rate, since assay results correlated with severity of disease but not with the presence or absence of spirochetes. Fear of a Herxheimer-like reaction should not dissuade clinicians from administering antibiotics to patients with leptospirosis.\r"

One hundred eighty-nine free-living elderly patients were admitted for hip fractures to a 1,120-bed community hospital during 1984-1986. At hospital discharge, 114 (60%) of these patients were institutionalized. One year later, 49/114 (43%) had returned to the community. Three factors independently correlated with patients' return to community living: being discharged to a nursing home with a large ratio of annual admissions to number of beds (RR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.65, 3.94), achieving any in-hospital ambulation (RR = 4.24, 95% CI 1.77, 8.14), and receiving conventional Medicare insurance (RR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.05, 0.53). These data suggest the existence of patient and nursing home features that identify those institutionalized patients with hip fractures who are more likely to return to community dwelling.\r"

Hydrochlorothiazide was added, if necessary. MAIN RESULTS: Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed on all cognitive tests. Cognitive test performance was not affected by beta blocker therapy in seven of nine tests and was enhanced on Trail Making Test. Performance was impaired only on Digit Cancellation. Neither Speilberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory nor the Beck Depression Inventory was affected by either beta blocker.

Evaluation was based on analysis of videotapes, simulated patient report of residents' behaviors, and chart notation. Trained compared with untrained residents asked more open-ended questions and fewer leading questions, summarized main points more frequently, did more psychosocial counseling, and were rated as having better communication skills by the simulated patient. The use of more focused and psychosocially directed questions, and fewer leading and grab-bag questions, was associated with more accurate diagnoses and management recorded in the medical chart. However, no significant difference was found in the charting practices of trained versus untrained residents.\r"

Incisional choices are optimally based on both facial esthetics and orbital function, which are achieved by an understanding of the unique anatomy of this region. The superior orbit is best approached by a blepharoplasty (lid crease) incision in conjunction with a lateral extension if additional exposure is necessary. Almost all aspects of the bony orbit can be reached with the exception of the frontal bone superior to the supraorbital rim. When wide exposure of the orbital skeleton is necessary, a bicoronal scalp flap is most effective in a nonalopecic patient. The inferior orbit can be approached by a ciliary, blepharoplasty, or conjunctival incision with a lateral canthotomy. None has proven esthetic advantages over the others, with the exception of the conjunctival incision when used alone. The lid incisions must be used with the understanding that orbital function must be assessed both pre- and postoperatively and meticulous attention paid to protection and care of the anterior globe. In addition, because of the thinness of the tissues being manipulated, edema, bruising, and final settling of lid form may require more postoperative time than is typical of more peripheral approaches.\r"

Theory and related empirical findings within this approach are reviewed, including the following: the assessment of a client's high-risk situations for relapse; the development of an individualized treatment plan; the distinction between treatment strategies aimed at \"initiation\" versus \"maintenance\" of behavior change; the importance of growth in client self-efficacy; the difference between the process of lapse versus relapse; the use of drugs in relapse prevention counseling; and the role of client-treatment matching. On the basis of the empirical evidence reviewed, it is concluded that a cognitive-social learning approach to relapse prevention is showing promise. Future directions for research are suggested.\r"

Research findings on the determinants of relapse for crack dependent patients and the psychosocial characteristics of the crack dependent individual justify the utility of certain relapse prevention strategies. Specifically, an approach to relapse is advocated that includes the provision of pharmacological adjuncts, psychoeducation on the multideterminants of relapse, and psychotherapy that attempts to remediate underlying psychological problems that are typically found in crack dependent patients.\r"

The model constructs a comprehensive framework for facilitating involvement in recovery activities that promote positive behavior change. The relapse prevention group component of the model is described, the use of a systematic relapse analysis procedure is presented, and an outline of plans for evaluating the model is discussed. The development of a comprehensive outpatient treatment model for treating cocaine dependency provides a standardized structure within which other treatment interventions (e.g., medication, acupuncture) could be evaluated.\r"

In addition, secondary prevention of alcohol problems with high-risk drinkers often utilizes moderation goals; these individuals are unlikely to fit the traditional alcoholic pattern, but are at risk for a variety of intoxication-related problems. Relapse prevention, an example of a tertiary prevention program to facilitate abstinence in the treatment of addiction, may also be applied to secondary prevention (moderation) goals. Following a description of the relapse prevention approach and its use with moderation goals, two studies applying this approach to secondary prevention are discussed, and summaries of the results are presented.\r"

Researchers randomly assigned newly recovering opioid addicts (N = 168) to experimental and control conditions, and followed them to assess their outcomes; 98% provided follow-up data. The intervention significantly reduced the probability and extent of relapse and helped unemployed subjects find work. RTSH also significantly reduced self-reported criminality.

Between 1974 and 1985, over 1.3 million smokers quit during each of those years. However, 75% to 80% of those individuals resumed smoking within six months. This article describes the dynamic phenomenon of smoking relapse within the context of cyclical episodes of smoking and quitting during an individual's lifetime. Theories of the determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed and methods designed to prevent relapse are described. Smoking relapse is discussed in terms of three aspects of tobacco addiction: (1) biological-addiction mechanisms, (2) conditioning processes, and (3) cognitive-social learning factors. The major determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed, including nicotine withdrawal, stress, weight gain, social influences, conditioning factors, causal attributions, and environmental variables. A trans-theoretical-developmental model is explored in the longitudinal investigation of the natural history of slips (lapses) and relapse episodes. Relapse prevention interventions are described that emphasize self-awareness, self-regulation, self-efficacy, affect regulation, social support, and lifestyle balance. Recent developments in pharmacological adjuncts to treatment are also examined. It is concluded that innovative relapse prevention methods need to be designed for hard-core smokers with histories of cessation failures, substance abuse and/or psychiatric impairment. These and other recommendations for future research on smoking relapse and relapse prevention are discussed.\r"

This article examines the fact that relapse is often related to uncovering painful early childhood incest experiences that have been defended against through self-destructive addictive behaviors. Another aspect of relapse is the phenomenon of multiaddictions: withdrawal from an identified addictive behavior will often lead to the unmasking of other addictive behaviors. The phenomenon of cross-addiction is widely acknowledged in the addictions field, but the connection between cross-addiction and relapse needs to be more fully explored. This article focuses on the following points: (1) addictive behaviors may serve to defend against memories of sexual abuse; (2) unidentified incest material may precipitate relapse or result from relapse, and therefore must be considered as a possible component of treatment in recovery--indications for treatment in terms of 12-Step recovery in conjunction with therapy are explored; (3) relapse may indicate the existence of additional addictions that must be identified and explored in order for recovery to proceed; and (4) sex and love addiction is often found in conjunction with alcoholism, codependency and compulsive overeating, and often comes to light through the emergence of incest memories. The identification and treatment of this hidden addiction (i.e., sex and love addiction) will determine the extent and depth of recovery.\r"

Despite this fact, new antimicrotubule agents that possess unique mechanisms of cytotoxic action and have broader antineoplastic spectra than the vinca alkaloids have not been introduced over the last several decades--until the recent development of taxol. Unlike classical antimicrotubule agents like colchicine and the vinca alkaloids, which induce depolymerization of microtubules, taxol induces tubulin polymerization and forms extremely stable and nonfunctional microtubules. Taxol has demonstrated broad activity in preclinical screening studies, and antineoplastic activity has been observed in several classically refractory tumors. These tumors include cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma in phase II trials and malignant melanoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma in phase I studies. Taxol's structural complexity has hampered the development of feasible processes for synthesis, and its extreme scarcity has limited the use of a conventional, broad-scale screening approach for evaluation of clinical antitumor activity. However, taxol's unique mechanism of action, its spectrum of preclinical antitumor activity, and tumor responses in early clinical trials have generated renewed interest in pursuing its development.\r"

  ".U": "90325279\r", 
  ".W": "A preponderance of carcinogenesis studies in rodents and epidemiologic studies in humans suggests a potential role of dietary fiber in the prevention of colorectal cancer. Recently, wheat bran fiber used as a dietary supplement has been shown to decrease the growth of rectal adenomatous polyps in patients with familial polyposis; however, few studies of high-risk human populations have been attempted to determine the effects of dietary fiber supplementation on markers of carcinogenesis in the colon or rectum. We have designed a one-arm study to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with wheat bran fiber [i.e., 13.5 g/day for 8 wk; after 1 mo, 2 g/day (compliance evaluation period)] on [3H]thymidine rectal mucosa cell labeling (i.e., percent of epithelial cells incorporating [3H]thymidine into DNA in intact rectal crypt cells over a 90-min exposure as well as in minced rectal biopsy tissue over a 24-hr exposure) in rectal biopsy specimens. The biopsy specimens were obtained at sigmoidoscopy in 17 compliant patients with a history of resected colon or rectal cancer. We categorized patients as having initially low or initially high [3H]thymidine-labeling indices (i.e., percent of mucosa cells that incorporate [3H]thymidine into DNA during 1.5- or 24-hour in vitro incubations) by using the median baseline labeling index as a cutoff between high and low values. On the basis of a chi-square test used to identify patients with a statistically significant (P less than .001) change, six of the eight patients who initially had high 24-hour outgrowth labeling indices showed a significant decrease in the rectal mucosa biopsy specimens obtained after treatment. An overall 22% decrease was observed in rectal mucosa cell biopsy specimens obtained at study termination (P less than .001). Of the eight patients with initially high total [3H]thymidine-labeling indices in crypt organ culture, four had a significant (P less than .001) decrease from baseline values, one had a significant increase, and three showed no change following the fiber intervention. The wheat bran fiber dietary supplement of 13.5 g/day was well tolerated by this group of older (54-70 yr) patients. Although the [3H]-thymidine labeling index data suggest that the wheat bran fiber supplement can inhibit DNA synthesis and rectal mucosa cell proliferation in high-risk patients, the results of this small pilot study should not be overinterpreted vis a vis the potential role of wheat bran fiber as a chemopreventive agent for colorectal cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The study was performed on a selected group of patients at high risk for further recurrences. All of these patients were pre-treated with different chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin or mitomycin C) and still had recurrent superficial transitional cell carcinoma. All tumors were removed by transurethral resection and all patients were presumed to be free of tumor at initiation of the prophylactic instillations. Patients in the ethoglucid group received 0.565 gm. (solution of 1%) ethoglucid weekly for 6 weeks and then monthly for 1 year. Patients in the keyhole-limpet hemocyanin group were immunized with 1 mg. keyhole-limpet hemocyanin intracutaneously, and then weekly bladder instillations of 30 mg. were given for 6 weeks and then monthly for 1 year. The percentage of recurrences, recurrence rate, interval free of disease, tumor progression and effect on downstaging were evaluated for both therapeutic arms. The percentage of recurrences (60.9% in the ethoglucid group versus 55.3% in the keyhole-limpet hemocyanin group) and the comparison of interval to recurrence for all patients showed no statistical significant difference (p = 0.808, Mantel-Cox test). A comparison of the interval to recurrence in patients with recurrent tumors only showed a mean interval free of disease of 8.8 months for patients given ethoglucid versus 5.5 months for those given keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (p = 0.006, Wilcoxon test). Recurrence rate (4.8 versus 6.5, respectively) and tumor progression rate (21.7 versus 21.1%, respectively) showed no statistically significant difference (p greater than 0.1).\r"

A total of 7 women who complained of the complication after a modified Stamey operation underwent our procedure in which the suspension loops were loosened to an adequate tension with the patient under local anesthesia. All patients recovered normal voiding without incontinence immediately after the procedure. The Stamey operation uses a nylon loop for suspension of the urethrovesical junction. Therefore, the tightness of the suspension loop can easily be readjusted postoperatively by the procedure, even though initially the suspension of the urethrovesical junction was too tight or too loose. We believe the procedure will enhance the value of the Stamey operation.\r"

Sonographically, the cystic dilatations displayed a typically cystic nature with no internal echoes. The cysts were located laterally or posteriorly to the bladder, and the cystic mass protruded into or was behind the bladder and sometimes bulged the bladder wall. The dysplastic kidney in the patients with ipsilateral cystic dilatations was not detected by sonography due to its small size and the fact that it was obscured by bowel gas or overlying tissue densities. Three cases of dilated ureter communicating with the cyst were found on sonography. Since ultrasonic examination is an excellent method to identify a fluid-filled cystic structure, ultrasonography has become an important modality in the early detection, diagnosis and followup of these cystic dilatations.\r"

During the last decade advances in noninvasive imaging techniques (ultrasound, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) have led to more accurate definition of intrarenal pathological conditions. The intuitive question presently is whether contralateral exploration remains mandatory in Wilms tumor patients. We reviewed the records of 52 consecutive children at our institutions who underwent radiological and operative staging of the Wilms tumor from 1979 to 1988. All 48 evaluable patients underwent either preoperative computerized tomography, ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging. Five bilateral Wilms tumors were diagnosed preoperatively and confirmed surgically, whereas extensive operative exploration of the contralateral kidney in the other 43 cases of radiologically diagnosed unilateral disease failed to reveal any contralateral abnormality. Thus, in all patients preoperative radiological investigation was accurate to stage the disease regarding bilaterality. With modern imaging techniques and effective chemotherapy, extensive contralateral renal exploration may no longer be mandatory to manage Wilms tumor.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that unilateral nephrectomy causes acceleration of the growth of a Wistar/Furth rat Wilms tumor. We studied this phenomenon in parabiotic rats by measuring tumor growth after either sham nephrectomy, or excision of 1, 2 or 3 kidneys. We observed no stimulation of tumor growth in the experimental groups. Renal function was significantly decreased after removal of 2 or 3 kidneys. Serum creatinine levels were significantly different between right and left members of parabiotic pairs in these 2 groups. The effect of unilateral and bilateral nephrectomy on tumor growth in single rats also was examined. In these rats progressive increases in tumor growth were observed after unilateral and bilateral nephrectomy. Our inability to demonstrate a tumor-stimulating factor in the parabiotic model may be due partly to incomplete sharing of humoral factors between parabionts. Serum transfer studies in vitro may prove more fruitful in demonstrating such a factor.\r"

We studied 13 boys who received an artificial urinary sphincter before puberty and compared them to 12 age-matched pubertal controls with meningomyelocele. The prostate morphology was evaluated by means of transrectal ultrasonography, and we compared this finding, as well as sexual development, erectile function and seminal emissions between the 2 groups. Boys in both groups had similar development of secondary sexual characteristics and reported similar erectile function. Ultrasonography demonstrated an imprint of the sphincter cuff on the prostate but patients and controls had equal prostatic growth. In both groups an unexpected finding was the unexplained presence of sonolucent and sonodense lesions within the prostate glands. We conclude that transrectal ultrasonography is an excellent means of examining the prostate in pubertal boys with meningomyelocele. An artificial urinary sphincter placed around the bladder neck does not alter sexual development, function, prostatic growth or prostatic morphology.\r"

  ".U": "90325376\r", 
  ".W": "Bacterial adherence to carbohydrate receptors on the surface of urothelial cells is important in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections. Blood group-related antigens, genetically determined carbohydrate structures found on the urothelial cell surface, may influence the availability of these receptors thereby affecting bacterial adherence and the susceptibility to urinary tract infections. Recent evidence indicates that the immunoanatomical distribution of type 1 blood group-related antigens in urothelium is influenced by ABO, Lewis and secretor phenotypes, women with Le(a-b-) and Le(a+b-) blood phenotypes have more than a 3-fold greater risk of recurrent urinary tract infections compared to Le(a-b+) women and epithelial cells from nonsecretors have more bacterial receptors than cells from secretors. To determine the relation between the expression of type 1 blood group-related antigens and urinary tract infections we performed an immunohistochemical analysis using a well characterized panel of monoclonal antibodies on 72 surgical specimens obtained from children who underwent correction of a structural genitourinary anomaly at the University of Rochester Medical Center from December 1983 to May 1988. Of 72 children 48 had a history of at least 1 documented urinary tract infection. The differences in the distribution of children by type 1 blood group immunophenotype in the infection and noninfection groups were highly significant (p = 0.003, Fisher's exact test). There is an increased frequency of urinary tract infections in children with genitourinary structural anomalies whose urothelium reflects the nonsecretor phenotype, that is they have minimal or undetectable levels of ABO and Leb reactivity compared to those with intense ABO and/or Leb immunoreactivity. Of 17 children with minimal or no ABO or Leb immunoreactivity 16 (94.1%) belonged to the infection group. Furthermore, 23 of 24 patients (95.8%) without a history of urinary tract infection expressed intense ABO and/or Leb immunoreactivity. It appears that the type 1 blood group-related antigen profile of urothelium influences susceptibility to urinary tract infection and it may be important in identifying patients who would benefit from prophylactic antibiotic therapy or earlier surgical intervention.\r"

Although the methods and principles of this treatment are effective, there are concerns regarding the safety and long-term effectiveness of these substances. We present a pilot study to explore the potential of an alternate substance (polyvinyl alcohol foam) for this treatment. Polyvinyl alcohol foam (Ivalon) particles measuring 150 to 250 mu. were injected submucosally into the bladder of New Zealand white rabbits. The bladder was examined macroscopically and microscopically at 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 2 and 3 months after the injection. The particles created a raised lesion under the mucosa that was visible to the naked eye as late as 3 months after the submucosal injection. The particles remained in a submucosal location after 3 months. At 1 week after injection there was a foreign body giant cell response to the particles. At 3 months the giant cell response persisted and the particles were surrounded by a fibrotic reaction. There was little inflammatory response otherwise. These preliminary results indicate that polyvinyl alcohol foam may be suitable for subureteral injection in the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux.\r"

We report 5 cases in which the fetal urinary electrolytes were not predictive of ultimate renal function. In 3 instances fetal urinary electrolytes and osmolarity were abnormally elevated but the infants survived without ventilatory support. In 2 of these 3 patients the volume of amniotic fluid was normal. Diagnoses included posterior urethral valves, prune belly variant and bilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction. In 2 cases with oligohydramnios fetal urinary electrolytes were suggestive of satisfactory renal function but the infants died of pulmonary hypoplasia and had bilateral renal dysplasia, prune belly syndrome and urethral atresia. Presently, the volume of amniotic fluid remains the most important prognostic sign in the fetus with bilateral hydronephrosis. Further work is necessary to identify other factors that may be more reliable as prognostic indexes of fetal renal function.\r"

Of these cases 119 (64%) were due to anomalies of the ureteropelvic junction. The remainder (36%) were due to various congenital uropathic conditions. Investigation consisted of renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography and diuretic renography with 99mtechnetium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid augmented with furosemide. Of the 119 renal units 36 (30%) underwent pyeloplasty, while 42 (35.7%) were considered normal without obstruction or dilatation. In 41 units (34.3%) diuretic renography showed partial obstruction or dilatation without obstruction that washed out readily with furosemide. Serial renal ultrasonography and renography were performed in these patients. A 12-month followup showed improvement or stabilization in 80% of the renal units and deterioration to significant obstruction in 20%. In attempting to identify the renal units that were most at risk for deterioration, it was realized that the initial ultrasound had a predictive role. None of the mildly hydronephrotic units deteriorated, whereas 14% of the moderately hydronephrotic and 32% of the markedly hydronephrotic units showed further deterioration. However, whether diuretic renography initially demonstrated partial obstruction or dilatation without obstruction, the ultimate outcome could not be predicted. Based on this experience an algorithm is proposed for the evaluation and management of antenatally detected hydronephrosis with currently available imaging techniques.\r"

Of 9 kidneys that showed poor function 3 recovered sufficient function on pigtail drainage to justify preservation and these patients underwent pyeloplasty. Of 27 kidneys with moderate function 23 also underwent pyeloplasty and 14 of these demonstrated improvement in function postoperatively. Of the 100 kidneys in the good function group that were followed conservatively 23 underwent pyeloplasty during followup primarily because of an observed decrease in function. We propose that there is no indication for immediate pyeloplasty in infants with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis who demonstrate good function postnatally.\r"

  ".W": "Seven patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms infected with salmonella organisms were surgically treated between 1985 and 1988. Salmonella culture was obtained from the wall of the aneurysm in every patient, and in five patients it was identified as Salmonella typhimurium. S. choleraesuis and salmonella group D (isolated from this patient but not speciated) were found in the other two remaining patients. Three patients underwent aneurysmal resection with axillofemoral bypass grafting, and three patients were treated by aneurysmal resection with in situ graft; two of this group had the wall and infective periaortic tissue excised. One patient died during the operation as a result of rupture of the aneurysm. Therapeutic doses of antibiotic drugs were given to all of the patients. Although two of the patients in the first group (with the axillofemoral bypass graft) died and the remaining patient had very complicated postoperative course, all the patients in the second group (with in situ graft) survived. We think that in situ graft placement after an extensive debridement of the aneurysmal wall and infected periaortic tissue together with more effective and adequate antibiotic therapy for at least 6 weeks after the operation is a satisfactory method of surgical treatment of this condition. However, graft infection is still a possibility, therefore regular follow-up is needed.\r"

In 10 patients (50%) the valves of the deep veins were incompetent as verified by Doppler ultrasonography, and deep vein thrombosis had previously been diagnosed in seven patients. After subfascial ligature, strain gauge plethysmography showed no changes in arterial flow, venous capacity, or in venous emptying rate. However, both venous reflux flow and reflux volume were significantly lowered (p less than 0.01) after surgery as compared to values before operation. The clinical objective results were good in all cases. In two of four patients with fair subjective results the arterial flow was pathologically high, which probably implies the presence of microscopic arteriovenous fistulas. It is concluded that strain gauge plethysmography can quantitate the change in deep venous reflux after ligation of perforating veins.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate day-to-day variability of Doppler ophthalmic pressure index by means of the ophthalmomanometry-Doppler technique, bilateral ophthalmic artery pressure and indirect systemic blood pressure determinations were repeated within 1 month in 40 patients with clinically stable occlusive carotid disease. No difference in Doppler ophthalmic pressure and calculated pressure index between both days could be demonstrated. The standard deviation of differences in ophthalmic pressure index between first and second day measurements was 0.04. Correlation between bilateral ophthalmic pressure index measurements on both days was high (r = 0.93, n = 80). It is concluded that individual Doppler ophthalmic pressure index must change at least 0.08 before it can be considered significant. In 37 patients with occlusive carotid artery disease (greater than 60% diameter reduction) undergoing 38 endarterectomies, Doppler ophthalmic pressure index was evaluated before and after surgery. Mean +/- SD ipsilateral Doppler ophthalmic pressure index increased from 0.59 +/- 0.07 to 0.71 +/- 0.05 (p less than 0.001) after endarterectomy. In 12 patients with significant bilateral occlusive carotid disease, mean +/- SD contralateral Doppler ophthalmic pressure index increased from 0.54 +/- 0.05 to 0.61 +/- 0.06 (p less than 0.02), whereas contralateral pressure index in patients with unilateral disease showed no change (0.71 vs 0.71) after ipsilateral endarterectomy. These results indicate that carotid endarterectomy not only normalizes ipsilateral Doppler ophthalmic pressure index but also improves contralateral Doppler ophthalmic pressure index provided significant bilateral occlusive carotid disease is present.\r"

Success of a grant application depends on preparation, design, and hypothesis. Potential applicants are encouraged to pay special attention to the many publications on how to prepare a research grant. Although there is an increase in participation by vascular surgeons in NIH-supported research, the funding support and focus on vascular surgery remains unsatisfactory. Despite the high ranking of death from aortic aneurysm, there is virtually no funded project on aortic aneurysm in either basic or clinical study. New technology such as laser has received some support, but clinical trial comparing this modality with standard treatment is lacking and not forthcoming. The participation by vascular surgeons in the American Heart Association-funded research activities remains unknown, even though the American Heart Association claims to have spent millions on research in heart and vascular diseases. To promote the study of and research in vascular disease, the members of this distinguished Society need to guide young vascular surgeons to submit grant proposals to various organizations.\r"

Sixteen patients were randomized to receive postcoital administration of a combination product of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, while 11 received postcoital placebo. The treatment groups were similar with respect to age, parity, diaphragm use, history of lifetime urinary tract infections, frequency of intercourse, and number of lifetime sexual partners. In over 6 months of observation, postcoital administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was highly effective in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections. Nine of 11 patients who took the placebo developed urinary tract infections (infection rate, 3.6 per patient-year), compared with only two of 16 patients who received postcoital trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (infection rate, 0.3 per patient-year). Postcoital administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was effective in patients with both low (two or fewer times per week) and high (three or more times per week) intercourse frequencies. Side effects were few and compliance was excellent. We conclude that postcoital trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a safe, effective, and inexpensive approach to management of recurrent urinary tract infections in young women.\r"

In our simulations of the Medicare Fee Schedule, we find that (1) redistributions of Medicare-allowed charges across specialities will be substantial but approximately only half the size projected by Hsaio, (2) there will be large redistributions among geographic areas that tend to compound the specialty redistributions, and (3) there will be wide variation within specialties as to how individual providers are affected. The majority of the redistributive impact of the Medicare Fee Schedule is attributable to implementation of a geographically adjusted system of standardized payments rather than to the particular work values developed by Hsiao et al in the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale.\r"

Treatment was given for 9 months, with 9 months of follow-up. A response to treatment as measured by ultrasonography was found in 58% of the T4 group, in 35% of the T4/CBZ group, and in 5% of the placebo group. The mean (SEM) decrease of thyroid volume at 9 months in the responders was 25% (2). After discontinuation of treatment, thyroid volume increased in the responders and had returned to base-line values after 9 months of follow-up. In the placebo group mean thyroid volume had increased by 6% (4) at 4 months, 20% (7) at 9 months, and 27% (8) at 18 months. The findings show that untreated sporadic non-toxic goitre continues to increase in size; T4 is effective in the treatment of the disorder; and the addition of CBZ has no therapeutic advantage.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatitis-B-associated glomerulonephritis (HBGN) is a distinct entity occurring frequently in hepatitis-B-prevalent areas of the world. The disease affects both adults and children who are chronic hepatitis-B-virus (HBV) carriers with or without a history of overt liver disease. The diagnosis is established by serologic evidence of HBV antigens/antibodies, presence of an immune complex glomerulonephritis, immunohistochemical localization of 1 or more HBV antigens, and pertinent clinical history, when available. In this study we present clinicopathologic and follow-up findings in 12 patients (7 children, 5 adults) with hepatitis-B-associated glomerulonephritis. Twelve patients provided 15 renal biopsies and 1 specimen of kidney tissue, obtained at autopsy; these were examined by light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical methods. Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) with or without mesangial proliferation was noted in 7 biopsies, mesangiocapillary (membranoproliferative) glomerulonephritis (MCGN) in 5 biopsies, and proliferative glomerulonephritis with or without membranous changes in 2 biopsies. Tubulointerstitial changes were minimal except in 3 adults, in whom they were attributable to arterionephrosclerosis. Ultrastructural findings included the presence of considerable amounts of focal or diffuse granular electron-dense deposits in the glomeruli, in the subepithelial, subendothelial, and mesangial locations, occasionally destroying or replacing the lamina densa of the basement membrane. Variable mesangial proliferation was also observed, with interposition, with focal irregular reduplication of the basement membranes and rare clusters of spherical particles, probably representing viral particles in the deposits. In addition, granular deposits along tubular basement membranes were seen in 1 case. The glomerular deposits stained for 2 or more immunoglobulins, the predominant one being IgG, and variably also for complement components (C3, C4 and C1q). Hepatitis B viral antigens (HBsAg, HBcAg, HBeAg) were demonstrated using acid elution techniques in the deposits in all biopsies where frozen tissue was available, singly or in a variety of combinations and intensities. There were deposits of IgG, C3, C1q, and HBsAg along the tubular basement membranes in 1 case. Follow-up biopsies in 2 cases, 2 and 5 years apart, showed a transformation from a diffuse MGN to MCGN with segmental membranous features. Follow-up biopsy after 3 years in the third patient, who went into clinical remission, revealed partially resolving glomerular lesions. Renal lesions secondary to chronic liver disease, parasitic diseases, certain tropical nephropathies, and lupus nephritis are some of the diseases that may morphologically resemble HBGN. Recognition and differentiation of HBGN from other entities may have significant prognostic and therapeutic implications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Additionally, histoplasmosis may be the cause of cases of chronic meningitis in patients with no other evidence for dissemination. Histoplasmosis may also cause cerebral or spinal cord mass lesions resembling neoplasms or abscesses, and encephalitis. Diagnosis of chronic meningitis or mass lesions caused by H. capsulatum may be difficult and involves careful analysis of serologic tests for antibodies, cultures and tests for HPA in body fluids. Amphotericin B remains the treatment of choice, but relapses occur in half of cases despite total courses of at least 35 mg/kg. Accordingly, careful long-term follow-up is required to identify patients with relapsing infection. Newer antifungal agents which cross the blood brain barrier are needed. A trial of amphotericin B treatment without surgical excision can be justified in patients with cerebral or spinal cord histoplasmomas, in view of the apparent success of such treatment in a few cases. Progression of clinical abnormalities or persistence of the lesion following completion of treatment would support the need for surgical excision.\r"

The transcription factors interact at the TATA box, which lies close to the position of transcription initiation. Activators typically bind to distant sites that can lie kilobases away from the initiation site. The factor TFIID binds specifically to the TATA box to initiate an ordered pathway of assembly of the basic transcription factors. Biochemical analyses have shown that human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFIID are functionally interchangeable in vitro. To study further the functional conservation of this critical factor, we are surveying proteins from divergent organisms that can substitute in vivo for the S. cerevisiae TFIID. We report here the isolation of a unique gene from Schizosaccharomyces pombe that fully complements a null mutation in SPT15, the gene that encodes TFIID in S. cerevisiae. The Schiz. pombe gene encodes a protein 93% identical (166/178) to S. cerevisiae TFIID in a region consisting of a direct repeat.\r"

Here we present a tertiary structure model of the ATP-binding cassettes characteristic of this class of transport system, based on similarities between the predicted secondary structures of members of this family and the previously determined structure of adenylate kinase. This model has implications for both the molecular basis of transport and cystic fibrosis and provides a framework for further experimentation.\r"

One of these, the insulin-regulatable glucose transporter (IRGT), is primarily expressed in muscle and fat, tissues that exhibit insulin-dependent glucose transport. Insulin promotes glucose transport in these tissues by stimulating movement of the glucose transporter from an intracellular location to the plasma membrane. Recent studies, however, suggest that an additional effect of insulin in these tissues may be the facilitation of glucose transport, presumably across capillary endothelium. This hypothesis is based on the localization of the IRGT in endothelial cells specific to muscle and adipose tissue. We report here, however, on morphological and biochemical studies using several different IRGT-specific antibodies in which we could not reproduce these results.\r"

  ".U": "90326192\r", 
  ".W": "The cell cycles of early Xenopus embryos consist of a rapid succession of alternating S and M phases. These cycles are controlled by the activity of a protein kinase complex (cdc2 kinase) which contains two subunits. One subunit is encoded by the frog homologue of the fission yeast cdc2+ gene, p34cdc2 and the other is a cyclin. The concentration of cyclins follows a sawtooth oscillation because they accumulate in interphase and are destroyed abruptly during mitosis. The association of cyclin and p34cdc2 is not sufficient for activation of cdc2 kinase, however; dephosphorylation of key tyrosine and threonine residues of p34cdc2 is necessary to turn on its kinase activity. The activity of cdc2 kinase is thus regulated by a combination of translational and post-translational mechanisms. The loss of cdc2 kinase activity at the end of mitosis depends on the destruction of the cyclin subunits. It has been suggested that this destruction is induced by cdc2 kinase itself, thereby providing a negative feedback loop to terminate mitosis. Here we report direct experimental evidence for this idea by showing that cyclin proteolysis can be triggered by adding cdc2 kinase to a cell-free extract of interphase Xenopus eggs.\r"

Binding of TFIID to the TATA box initiates the assembly of other general transcription factors as well as RNA polymerase II at the promoter resulting in a preinitiation complex capable of accurate transcription initiation in vitro. Human TFIID has been shown to interact with various regulatory factors. The observation that stimulation of transcription by different trans-acting factors is mediated through distinct TATA elements led to the suggestion that different types of TFIID may exist in yeast, humans and plants. Here we report the cloning and characterization of two distinct TFIID complementary DNA clones from Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, we have found that TFIID from Arabidopsis and other organisms shows homology to helix-loop-helix proteins.\r"

Although the core sequences are very similar (approximately 60% identity), the open reading frames seem to be unrelated. Single crossover recombination events between homologous core sequences in the closely linked td and nrdB introns have led to 'exon shuffling. Here we describe spontaneous double crossovers between the unlinked td and sun Y introns that result in shuffling of an intron structure element, P7.1 (refs 3 and 4). The intron domain-switch variants were isolated as genetic suppressors of a splicing-defective P7.1 deletion in the td intron. This unprecedented example of suppression through inter-intron sequence substitution indicates that the introns are in a state of genetic flux and implies the functional interchangeability of the two analogous but nonidentical P7.1 elements. The implications of such recombination events are discussed in the light of the evolution of the introns themselves as well as that of their host genomes.\r"

Polyclonal antikeratin antibody was helpful and gave the most consistent results when compared with monoclonal antikeratin antibodies, AE1/3 and PKK1. The electron microscopic study of four lesions also established the epithelial nature of the tumor cells. Intracytoplasmic tonofilaments and a few desmosomes were present.

Using an immunoperoxidase technique, herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigens were detected in keratocytes, endothelial cells, and foci of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells around Descemet's membrane. Both granulomatous reactions and HSV antigens were identified significantly more often in specimens with ulcerative necrotizing stromal keratitis than in those from patients with stromal scarring or nonulcerative nonnecrotizing keratitis (P less than 0.00001 and P less than 0.005, respectively). Herpes simplex virus antigens also were present in endothelial cells adjacent to foci of granulomatous reactions around Descemet's membrane in association with disciform stromal scarring. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of HSV antigens in human corneal endothelial cells and in the granulomatous reactions at the level of Descemet's membrane.\r"

The onset was acute with discomfort, photophobia, hyperemia, and mucus production. This resulted in early loosening of sutures and was associated with microbial keratitis in two cases and graft rejection in one. The inflammatory reaction was controlled with high-dose oral steroids and did not recur when the treatment was terminated. Serum IgE levels were elevated in all these patients (range, 421-8434 kU/l). Binding of this IgE onto the surface of mast cells in the conjunctiva with subsequent degranulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of the induced inflammation. Principal recommendations include the use of interrupted sutures and early immunosuppression with high-dose oral steroids at the onset of this condition together with the control of risk factors for microbial keratitis.\r"

It now seems that the Conus species (approximately 500 in number) will each use a distinctive assortment of peptides and that the pharmacological diversity in Conus venoms may be ultimately comparable to that of plant alkaloids or secondary metabolites of microorganisms. The cone snails may generate this diverse spectrum of venom peptides by a \"fold-lock-cut\" synthetic pathway. These peptides are specific enough to discriminate effectively between closely related receptor subtypes and can be used for structure-function correlations.\r"

To investigate the molecular basis for this difference, mRNA from brains of LS and SS mice was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the ethanol sensitivity of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA)- and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-activated ion channels was tested. Ethanol facilitated GABA responses in oocytes injected with mRNA from LS mice but antagonized responses in oocytes injected with mRNA from SS animals. Ethanol inhibited NMDA responses equally in the two lines. Thus, genes coding for the GABAA receptor or associated proteins may be critical determinants of individual differences in ethanol sensitivity.\r"

  ".U": "90327591\r", 
  ".W": "The canine prostate appears to be a suitable model for investigating many aspects of abnormal prostate growth related to BPH. This model has indicated that BPH is a complex pathologic process that varies with age and produces a gland that is composed of a mixture of glandular, cystic, and stromal hyperplasia juxtapositioned with foci of atrophy. Canine BPH first occurs very early in life as a glandular hyperplasia before the onset of more complex BPH. As the prostate increases in size with age, the tissue dihydrotestosterone content falls, as does the secretory capacity of the gland. The fall in glandular dihydrotestosterone content is counterbalanced by a concomitant increase in the metabolism of androgens toward dihydrotestosterone and an increase in nuclear androgen receptors. As the prostate ages, it thus becomes more sensitive to androgens, which are required for maintaining the abnormal size of the gland. Established BPH can be maintained in the absence of the testes in the presence of normal testosterone levels, and it appears that the abnormal growth is primarily attributable to an inherent change that has occurred in the aged prostate. In the dog and man, both the normal prostate and BPH are rich in growth factors and dihydrotestosterone receptor in the nucleus, yet mitotic cells are rare. Established BPH is not growing rapidly; the abnormal size of the aged prostate is maintained, not by an increase in the rate of cell replication, but rather by an apparent decrease in the rate of cell death. It appears that a combination of estrogens and 5 alpha-reduced androgens can cause this decrease in the rate of cell death and replication and that this imbalance can produce abnormal cell accumulation and an experimental prostatic hyperplasia. Besides affecting cell death and replication, estradiol has a marked effect in stimulating the stroma and collagen synthesis. Current investigations are focusing on determining the distribution of stem cells for both the epithelial and the stromal elements of the prostate, how these stem cells are recruited to form transiently proliferating cells, and how they mature and subsequently are programmed for cell death. It is believed that steroid imprinting in the neonatal and prepubertal period may be of great importance in determining the ultimate growth of the prostate. Preliminary attempts to control abnormal canine prostate growth by forcing maturation with retinoic acid, or by interfering with growth factors through the use of suramin, have not proved effective; only androgen ablation is. Important leads in the search for the etiology and control of BPH can be studied in the canine model. These concepts must ultimately be tested and confirmed for human BPH in well-controlled clinical investigations.\r"

Diffuse non-nodular enlargement of the transition zone is the commonest morphologic feature of BPH, but nodules show a greater potential for growth and comprise most of the tissue in large (more than 50-gm) resection specimens. Most nodules are predominantly glandular, with features that suggest a pathogenetic role of induction of embryonic-type stroma.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacologic strategies for the treatment of BPH are at present directed toward relaxing prostate smooth muscle and reducing prostate volume. Historically, the primary limitation of pharmacotherapy for BPH has been that the symptomatic improvement achieved was overshadowed by the morbidity of treatment. However, the morbidity has been markedly diminished based on a more precise understanding of the embryology, physiology, and pharmacology of the prostate. The origins and pharmacologic properties of the smooth musculature of the prostate and bladder are unique. Therefore, drugs such as alpha blockers may relax the prostate selectively without altering bladder function. Although phenoxybenzamine, a nonselective alpha blocker, relieves infravesical obstruction secondary to BPH, the severity of the adverse reactions limits the use of this drug. The contractile properties of the prostate smooth muscle are mediated by alpha-1 adrenoceptors. The effectiveness of phenoxybenzamine and selective alpha-1 blockers such as prazosin and terazosin are similar. The side effects of the selective alpha-1 blockers are negligible. Androgen suppression, which lowers testosterone, produces intolerable side effects such as gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, and impaired libido. The androgen dependency of the prostate provides the rationale for using 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors for the treatment of BPH. Reduction of prostate volume can be achieved by blocking the action or synthesis of dihydrotestosterone without impotence, gynecomastia, and hot flashes. These recent advances in pharmacotherapy for BPH are based on understanding of the fundamental developmental properties of the prostate.\r"

Age is by the far the most important determinant of BPH occurrence. Symptomatic BPH has a waxing and waning course, and a few men may have long-term remission. Surprisingly, the natural history of BPH is poorly defined, particularly with regard to the magnitude of the risks of its complications.\r"

  ".W": "The optimal evaluation of the patient with symptomatic BPH should include the diagnostic testing necessary to supplement the clinical examination and select a suitable medical, surgical, or interventional therapeutic option. A variety of imaging modalities offer unique but often unnecessary, superfluous, or very expensive information. Rarely is therapeutic intervention for symptomatic BPH denied a patient because of lesions detected with screening imaging tests; it may be only delayed rather than withheld. Virtually all pretreatment IVUs in patients with BPH are normal. Estimates range from 73 to 93 per cent of the studies as normal or having only insignificant findings. Significant pathology, either life-threatening or sufficient to alter or delay treatment, is found between 0.5 and 10 per cent of the time. Upper tract hydronephrosis is the most common finding (3 to 13 per cent). Renal or urothelial cancer prevalence in the patient population with BPH is really no different than in the general population. If signs or symptoms are not present to alert the clinician to some risk factor other than the symptoms of BPH, there is no benefit for routine urography solely for upper tract cancer detection. Furthermore, with the growing use of nonionic contrast media for elderly patients, the cost of the preoperative routine IVU will increase even further as the added charge for contrast ($100 or more) is tacked onto the cost of the study. Azotemic patients are best served by diagnostic ultrasound or by Foley catheter drainage prior to urography when indicated. Ultrasound remains an operator-dependent and technology-limited examination that cannot measure renal function, but the sensitivity and specificity, as well as the overall diagnostic accuracy, are equal to or greater than those of urography for the detection of hydronephrosis, cystic renal masses, and bladder or prostate abnormalities. False-positive ultrasound scans do occur secondary to reflux caused by bladder diverticula, megacalicosis, or other congenital abnormalities. However, these lesions are distinctly rare. Sensitivity for urothelial malignancy is not good, but endoscopic, clinical, and laboratory evaluations should provide adequate pretherapy diagnostic screening. In spite of the preoperative comfort that a normal IVU may give the patient and the operating surgeon, routine intravenous urography for all BPH patients should no longer be considered necessary. Diagnostic ultrasound, either transabdominal or transrectal, also offers the ability to evaluate the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, effectively replacing routine intravenous urography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Urodynamics has developed the methodology for analyzing and measuring the mechanics of urinary tract voiding function in detail. There is a consensus in the urodynamic research community about realistic models of detrusor muscle mechanics and bladder outlet hydrodynamics, as is reflected in the very similar concepts proposed for clinical application. The pressure-flow diagram offers a simple graphical procedure for detailed assessment of the individual voiding balance. Most clinically relevant is the specific characterization of outlet function, because detrusor contraction strength cannot be pharmacologically influenced. It is difficult to accept that the best way to measure \"prostatic obstruction\" is symptom assessment rather than urodynamic measurement of the clearly mechanical entity \"outlet obstruction\". Urodynamics has evolved into scientifically accurate and specific techniques for voiding analysis. It is unreasonably to continue to use terms such as \"outflow obstruction\" or \"weak detrusor\" and all their synonyms in an undefined, speculative way. If we maintain that the clinical relevance of BPH is entirely related to outflow obstruction, then we must demonstrate obstruction objectively before surgery. If we aim at the treatment of symptoms alone, then we must become more specific in terminology and demonstrate that transurethral prostatic resection is indeed the optimum therapy for unobstructed symptomatic patients with BPH. Similarly, we must use the advanced urodynamic concepts to investigate the efficacy of newly suggested alternatives to resection such as prostatic balloon dilatation or pharmacologic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A large number of cases of prostatic carcinoma are discovered unexpectedly by simple prostatectomy performed for presumed benign disease. The ability to discover these cancers preoperatively is an appealing concept, in other words, to screen: the use of a test to detect a disease in an asymptomatic individual. The ideal screening test would be noninvasive, inexpensive, reliable, and reproducible. It would also have a high sensitivity and specificity, neither allowing a disease process to be missed by a falsely negative result nor leading to unnecessary and more invasive studies by a falsely positive one. It has been suggested that an acceptable screening test have a sensitivity of at least 95 per cent and a specificity of 100 per cent. An equally important criterion for a successful screening program for cancer has to do with the biologic potential of the discovered malignancy. The adage is that more men die with prostate cancer than of prostate cancer. However, the biologic potential of prostate cancer has not been fully elucidated, and it is not entirely clear who will benefit from treatment and who should be left alone. At the present time, noninvasive imaging modalities and biochemical markers are not clinically useful in detecting occult prostatic carcinoma. Furthermore, no study has proved that routine screening reduces the mortality rate from prostate cancer. Many authors believe that screening men for prostate cancer should be regarded as investigational and that currently, only screening programs for breast and cervical cancer have been fully demonstrated to be effective. New studies are needed that include control groups who are not subjected to the early diagnostic modality, assessing both the disadvantages of the screening program and the potential benefits.\r"

American urologists assign TURP a significantly higher relative value than that proposed in the pending national Medicare Fee Schedule formulated by medical economists and the Physician Payment Review Commission. The legislated reductions in allowable Medicare fees for TURP and the possible shift in management of benign prostatic hyperplasia to nonsurgical methods create a financial vulnerability for American urologists who remain economically dependent on this dominant operation. Adjustments in practice patterns and manpower policy planning may well be required.\r"

We do recommend that patients with risk factors that increase the rate or consequence of urinary tract infection, those with previous urinary tract infections, or those with indwelling urethral catheters, even though the urine shows no growth, receive perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis. Antimicrobial therapy is mandatory for patients with preoperative bacteriuria. The drug must be selected according to the susceptibility of the pathogen, and the duration of treatment must be guided by the severity of the infection. At the time of catheter removal, antimicrobial prophylaxis is probably beneficial, and antimicrobial therapy is essential if bacteriuria is present prior to catheter removal. All patients must have cultures after catheter removal and antimicrobial therapy if a urinary tract infection is identified.\r"

To date, 93 patients have been included, and 3 months postoperatively, 80 to 90 per cent of the patients in each group reported improvement. There was also a significant decrease in symptom scores and a significant increase in maximum urinary flow rate, with great variation within each group but without difference between the groups. In both groups, there appears to be some deterioration over time. Operating time, estimated blood loss, time to catheter removal postoperatively, and duration of postoperative hospital stay were all significantly in favor of TUIP. Loss of ejaculation was reported by 37 per cent of patients after TURP and by 13 per cent after TUIP (not statistically significant). There was no difference between the groups in the need for further surgery. Therefore, TUIP is recommended as an alternative to TURP in patients with small prostates.\r"

The exact role this treatment has to play in the overall management of these patients has yet to be clearly defined. A continuing search is being made for more effective drugs, with the hope of finding one that will be more specific in its action on the prostate and produce fewer generalized effects. Whether this will prove possible may depend on whether any further subgroup of alpha receptors more specific to the prostate can be found or whether some method of targeting the drugs to the required region can be devised. If a drug treatment that reduces the size of the prostate can be found, perhaps a combination of the two forms of medical treatment will have a place. At present, it seems reasonable to conclude that there is good justification for using the alpha-blocking drugs available when employed in the manner and for the indications outlined herein.\r"

The ultimate role of alpha blockade for the management of symptomatic BPH is undefined pending their resolution. The effectiveness of nonselective alpha blockers such as phenoxybenzamine is counterbalanced by the incidence and severity of adverse reactions. Selective alpha blockers such as prazosin and terazosin are far better tolerated while providing similar degrees of subjective and objective relief of bladder outlet obstruction. The preliminary experience with alpha blockers demonstrates statistically and clinically significant improvements in the symptoms of prostatism and urinary flow rates, and the majority of patients receiving alpha blockers have been extremely satisfied. The data on alpha blockers are preliminary, and therefore the role of these drugs at present must be decided upon by the individual urologist. There is sufficient evidence to justify the use of alpha blockers for men with moderate symptoms of prostatism, yet urologists may validly interpret the clinical experience with alpha blockers as preliminary. Nevertheless, urologists should at least present this option to patients before performing a prostatectomy. The patients selected for alpha blockade must be advised that the drugs alleviate the symptoms of prostatism rather than permanently reversing the pathophysiology of BPH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Antiandrogen therapy appears to produce a 30 to 40 per cent decrease in the volume of the hyperplastic prostate after 3 to 6 months of therapy (Table 5). Longer treatment may result in further prostatic regression, although this remains to be seen. Biopsy studies suggest that epithelial regression occurs to a much more significant degree than does stromal regression, but this finding may simply reflect the relatively longer turnover of the stromal cell population. The significant placebo effect of oral medication in patients with BPH makes interpretation of clinical symptomatology and uro-flow data difficult. Analysis of symptom improvement is further complicated by the relatively slow improvement of patients on antiandrogen therapy, in contrast to surgery, in which relief is immediate. In addition to limited stromal involution and inadequate treatment duration, other biologic factors may limit the clinical efficacy of antiandrogen therapy. Most importantly, prostatic involution may not necessarily decrease urethral resistance. In addition, obstruction-induced detrusor dysfunction may persist after relief of outflow obstruction in some patients, as it does after surgery. Incomplete antiandrogen action of the compounds, as well as compliance issues, may likewise limit efficacy. Although there are no data to suggest that the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride will be more effective than other antiandrogen compounds in the treatment of BPH, preliminary studies suggest that it has less toxicity. If long-term studies validate a modest but significant clinical response rate and preservation of sexual function, then finasteride therapy may well be acceptable to a subgroup of men presenting with the symptoms of BPH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Methadone hydrochloride, the most commonly used opiate agonist, is used for both withdrawal and maintenance therapy. However, it produces dependence and withdrawal results upon abrupt discontinuation. Other opiate agonists including L-alpha acetyl methadyl (LAAM) and propoxyphene napsylate have been used for both withdrawal and maintenance therapy. LAAM is currently available only as an investigational agent and propoxyphene is easily accessible but has been associated with hallucinations and dysphoria at high doses. Alpha 2-adrenergic agonists decrease opiate withdrawal symptoms by decreasing the central adrenergic hyperarousal that is associated with withdrawal. Clonidine effectively attenuates but does not totally eliminate withdrawal symptoms. Other alpha 2-adrenergic agonists (e.g., lofexidine hydrochloride, guanfacine hydrochloride, and guanabenz) have undergone only preliminary investigations. Although alpha 2 agonists effectively decrease most withdrawal symptoms they often cause hypotension. Buprenorphine hydrochloride is a partial opiate agonist that shows some promise in the treatment of the heroin-dependent population. It attenuates opiate craving and causes only minimal withdrawal upon abrupt discontinuation. Because it is well accepted by the heroin-dependent population, however, it may ultimately become an abused substance. Naltrexone is a potent, orally acting opiate antagonist that blocks all opiate-agonist effects and causes no euphoria. Unfortunately, it has not been well accepted by the heroin-dependent population. Scant research has been conducted concerning the use of adjunctive medications during opioid withdrawal.\r"

Although ribavirin-treated patients appear to be subjectively improved, the benefit in terms of decreased morbidity and mortality is not well established. Furthermore, the drug has been found to be teratogenic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic, depending upon the scientific model. Because of its unique mode of administration, environmental exposure of healthcare personnel and other patients may occur. Although administration in mechanically ventilated patients decreases the amount of ribavirin liberated into the atmosphere, the drug crystallizes in the endotracheal tube, occasionally resulting in reduced ventilation. The lack of data documenting efficacy and the above environmental concerns result in difficult decisions for hospitals. Further studies are necessary to clarify the value and safety of ribavirin in the treatment of RSV infection.\r"

  ".W": "Clomipramine hydrochloride, a chlorinated analog of imipramine, is a widely used antidepressant recently approved for use in the U.S. for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a potentially incapacitating affliction. Its primary pharmacologic action is blockade of the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Its metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, is a potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Significant first-pass metabolism reduces oral bioavailability to less than 62 percent. The drug is widely distributed throughout the body (volume of distribution 9-25 L/kg) and is 90-98 percent protein-bound. Clomipramine follows first-order elimination pharmacokinetics, with a plasma half-life of 20-24 hours. Recent double-blind controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the drug's effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. Response is most often associated with doses greater than 75 mg/d, with 250 mg the maximum recommended daily dose. Relapse upon withdrawal is frequently reported. The adverse effect profile of clomipramine is similar to other tricyclic antidepressants, with anticholinergic, cardiovascular, sexual, and central nervous system effects the most prominent.\r"

It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, has a bioavailability of 34-38 percent, and is 95 percent bound to plasma proteins. Moricizine is extensively metabolized and may have pharmacologically active metabolites. A recent clinical study has shown that moricizine is slightly less effective than encainide or flecainide in suppressing ventricular premature depolarizations. Compared with disopyramide and quinidine, moricizine was equally or more effective in suppressing ventricular premature depolarizations, couplets, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Further studies are needed comparing moricizine with other class 1 agents in the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias; available data suggest that moricizine is comparable with these agents in the treatment of ventricular tachycardias and fibrillation. Moricizine appears to have a low incidence of serious adverse effects compared with other antiarrhythmics. This combination of apparently similar efficacy with a decreased incidence of adverse effects makes moricizine a worthwhile addition to currently available antiarrhythmic agents.\r"

Zidovudine 1500 mg/d was previously prescribed only to adult HIV-infected patients who had developed AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). However, results obtained from recently completed studies indicate that a lower daily dose (500 mg) appears to be equivalent. In addition, ZDV therapy appears to be beneficial to asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with CD4+ counts less than 500/mm3. The toxicity profile of ZDV, previously obtained from patients receiving 1500 mg/d, consisted of either acute (e.g., fever, rash, headache) or chronic (e.g., anemia, neutropenia, myopathy) adverse effects. ZDV pharmacokinetics are variable within and between the different subpopulations of HIV-infected patients who have been studied. Bioavailability ranges from 50 to 70 percent, and values for half-life, total body clearance, and volume of distribution are 1-2 h, 20-40 mL/min/kg, and 1-2 L/kg, respectively. Drug interactions occur primarily between ZDV and other agents that undergo hepatic glucuronidation (e.g., probenecid, sulfamethoxazole) resulting in decreased ZDV clearance. ZDV is currently measured by HPLC, radioimmunoassay and FPIA; however, the role of therapeutic monitoring is currently under investigation. Studies of ZDV therapy in neonates, pediatric patients, patients with resistant isolates of HIV, and HIV-infected patients receiving combined treatment with other reverse transcriptase inhibitors or immunomodulators are ongoing.\r"

Prolonged suppression or elimination of the leukemic cell clone by interferon may ultimately increase survival of patients with CML. Interferon is not effective single-agent therapy for multiple myeloma, but improves response rate when combined with conventional agents. AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma demonstrates a 40 percent objective response rate to interferon, with less risk of immune system suppression than conventional cytotoxics. Other applications of alfa interferon include malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Beta interferon is similar to the alfa subtype and may have utility in treatment of brain tumors.

  ".W": "Seven healthy, normal-weight subjects were fed breakfasts of 50 g protein, 50 g glucose, and 10, 30, or 50 g protein plus 50 g glucose in random sequence. Plasma glucose, insulin, C peptide, glucagon, nonesterified fatty acids, and alpha-amino nitrogen were then measured from samples obtained over 4 h. The postmeal net area of each response curve was calculated. Ingestion of 50 g protein alone did not change the serum glucose concentration. The various amounts of protein ingested with 50 g glucose also did not alter the serum glucose response compared with that observed with 50 g glucose alone. Ingestion of the various amounts of protein also did not result in a further increase in insulin concentration when ingested with glucose, except with the 50-g-protein dose. This increase was modest. Ingestion of glucose resulted in a decrease in alpha-amino nitrogen and glucagon concentrations whereas ingestion of protein increased them as expected. Additions of progressively larger amounts of protein to the glucose meal resulted in a progressive increase in the alpha-amino-nitrogen- and glucagon-area responses. The relationship was curvilinear for both the alpha-amino-nitrogen response and the glucagon response. The null point, that is, the protein dose ingested with 50 g glucose at which there would be no change in area response, was estimated to be 9 g protein for alpha-amino nitrogen and 5 g protein for glucagon.\r"

The high mean plasma phenylalanine concentrations were similar after administration of aspartame alone (158 +/- 28.9 mumol/L, mean +/- SD) and administration of aspartame plus sucrose (134 +/- 44.1 mumol/L). Evaluation of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for phenylalanine also showed no significant difference between groups (197 +/- 49.1 vs 182 +/- 28.3 mumol.L-1.h for aspartame alone and aspartame plus sucrose, respectively). Similarly, the high mean ratio of phenylalanine to large neutral amino acids (Phe:LNAA) in plasma did not differ significantly (0.265 +/- 0.046 for aspartame alone, 0.275 +/- 0.107 for aspartame plus sucrose). However, there was a small but significant difference between groups for the 4-h AUC values for plasma Phe:LNAA. The simultaneous ingestion of sucrose with aspartame had only minor effects on aspartame's metabolic disposition.\r"

Comparison with partial duodenopancreatectomy showed that both procedures can alleviate the majority of symptoms. However, duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas has lower early and late postoperative complication rates. It facilitates occupational rehabilitation, does not alter the patients glucose metabolism, and leaves fewer patients symptomatic in long-term follow-up. A higher rate of recurrence of pancreatitis of the tail is not found. Duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas is thus considered to be an alternative to partial duodenopancreatectomy in treatment of severe chronic pancreatitis of the head.\r"

Also, in a larger series, ultrasonically guided fine-needle biopsy confirms its high specificity and overall accuracy. The cytologic assessment of the obtained material is almost always adequate. The use of immediate cytologic staining reduces the number of passes in each lesion with absence of insufficient sampling.

The laboratory data showed elevated hepatobiliary enzymes. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed a slightly dilated common bile duct and a short major pancreatic duct connected with a minor pancreatic duct. Ultrasonography and computerized tomography could not identify any pancreatic tissue in the region of the body or tail of the pancreas. The pancreatic tissue weight calculated by the serial thin slice of computerized tomography was 43.1 g, approximately 45% of the standard Japanese adult pancreas. Reevaluated pancreatic exocrine function based on this weight showed a hypersecretory state. The pancreatic ductal pressure was slightly increased, and the motility of the sphincter of Oddi (SO) was abnormal when measured with a 4Fr. microtransducer inserted through a duodenoscope. These findings suggest that dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi may play some role in the pathophysiology in the hypoplasia of the dorsal pancreas and pancreaticobiliary diseases associated with it.\r"

  ".W": "Since the introduction of the LeVeen modification of the peritoneovenous shunt (PVS) in 1974, these devices have been placed in a relatively large number of patients. The most common indication has been for medically intractable ascites in the setting of chronic liver disease. A review of a series of studies shows that we can expect approximately an 18% perioperative overall mortality rate, a 46% survival rate at 21 months, and loss of ascites in 59% of the survivors at 18 months. The PVS has not been shown by prospective trials to prolong survival significantly in patients with either intractable ascites or the hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), although it may shorten hospitalizations, compared with medical controls. A few well-documented cases of reversal of the HRS have been documented. The best results of PVS therapy have been evident in those patients with milder liver disease. The loss of ascites need not correlate with a functioning shunt. Alcohol abstinance is associated with hepatic functional recovery and may relate to the disappearance of renal sodium retention, resulting in shunt occlusion due to low flow. A number of serious complications with the PVS have been described. Nutritional repletion follows successful shunting, but might, in part, relate to simultaneous alcohol abstention. The more common complications of coagulopathy and fluid overload are preventable by total ascitic drainage at the time of surgery. Shunt patency remains a clinical problem. Only 18.6% of the total shunts placed functioned in the survivors at 2 yr. Perioperative infections with staphylococcal and Gram-negative organisms occur. Postoperative bacterial peritonitis or septicemia requires shunt removal for cure.\r"

Three patients underwent colectomies; three showed a response to oral steroids. One had rectal prolapse. Although reminiscent of inflammatory cloacogenic polyps or solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, the polyps extended into the sigmoid colon, were quite numerous, and showed only mild smooth muscle insinuation in the lamina propria.

We studied 66 patients in this prospective, randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcome associated with tocolysis with nifedipine or ritodrine. Delivery was delayed for 48 hours, 7 days, and until the thirty-sixth week of gestation in 84%, 70%, and 41%, respectively, of patients in the nifedipine group, compared with 72%, 63%, and 52% of patients in the ritodrine group (difference not significant). Maternal side effects were more common and more serious in the group of patients who received ritodrine compared with those who received nifedipine (18 of 38 versus 5 of 38, p less than 0.01); however, fetal and neonatal outcome appeared to be similar when the groups were compared. On the basis of this study, it appears that tocolysis with either nifedipine or ritodrine is equally efficacious; however, maternal side effects are less common with nifedipine treatment. We conclude that nifedipine may have a role in the treatment of preterm labor but suggest further careful evaluation of this agent before it is considered for routine clinical use.\r"

Eleven patients demonstrated a thin \"pencil line\" endometrial echo in which the maximum anteroposterior thickness on the long axis view was less than or equal to 5 mm. All eleven patients had minimal tissue obtained on biopsy and a pathology report of \"tissue insufficient for diagnosis.\" Seventeen patients had an echogenic endometrium greater than or equal to 6 mm. Pathology reports of their samples revealed tissue insufficient for diagnosis (two cases), proliferative endometrium (six), secretory endometrium (three), hyperplastic endometrium (three), polyp (two), and endometrial cancer (one case). Two additional patients had no endometrial echo visualized because of associated myomas. These findings suggest (1) that the absence of significant endometrial tissue (echo less than or equal to 5 mm) on vaginal ultrasonography in cases with postmenopausal bleeding is uniformly associated with tissue insufficient for diagnosis, and (2) when endometrial thickness is greater than or equal to 6 mm the histologic diagnosis should be determined in the pathology laboratory.\r"

Univariate analysis revealed 11 variables associated with a significantly (p less than 0.05) increased risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes. After multiple logistic regression analysis, three variables remained in the model as independent risk factors: antepartum vaginal bleeding in more than one trimester (odds ratio 7.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.2, 25.6), current cigarette smoking (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4, 3.1), and previous preterm delivery (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4, 2.5). Cessation of cigarette smoking by pregnant women may reduce the risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes.

Pregnant BALB/c mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 15 mg of IgG on day 8 of pregnancy. Typically, mice treated with IgG from antiphospholipid antibodies aborted within 48 hours. When animals were sacrificed on days 9 to 15, the uterus of each animal was inspected for the presence of live, dead, or resorbing fetuses. In contrast to mice injected with control IgG or saline solution, each mouse injected with IgG from antiphospholipid antibodies aborted and no live fetuses were found (p less than 0.05). Histologic examination of the uteroplacental interface showed decidual necrosis in the mice treated with IgG containing antiphospholipid antibodies, and immunofluorescent studies also showed prominent intravascular decidual IgG and fibrin deposition. We conclude that IgG from antiphospholipid antibodies of women with fetal loss causes fetal loss in BALB/c mice.

  ".W": "Ultrasonic umbilical artery blood flow velocity waveform indexes decrease throughout gestation as umbilical blood flow increases. However, it is not known whether the decrease in indexes such as systolic/diastolic ratio is a direct result of a change in umbilical vascular resistance. Umbilical artery blood flow was measured as vasoactive agents angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin, norepinephrine, serotonin, and the thromboxane A2 sympathomimetic agent U-46619 were infused into the inferior vena cava of chronically instrumented ovine fetuses. Angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin, norepinephrine, serotonin, and U-46619 all significantly increased fetal arterial pressure levels. Angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin, and U-46619 significantly reduced umbilical blood flow and fetal heart rate. All five pressor agents increased umbilical vascular resistance. Systolic/diastolic ratios were obtained from pulsatile umbilical blood flow tracings. Systolic/diastolic ratios before infusions were significantly correlated with baseline values of umbilical blood flow (r = -0.55) and umbilical vascular resistance (r = 0.52). Systolic/diastolic ratios decreased with increasing infusion rates of angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin, norepinephrine, and serotonin, and increased with infusion of U-46619. There was no significant correlation between systolic/diastolic ratio and either umbilical blood flow or umbilical vascular resistance during infusion of angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin, or serotonin. Systolic/diastolic ratio decreased with increasing umbilical vascular resistance during norepinephrine infusion (r = -0.44). Systolic/diastolic ratio changed in the predicted direction only when umbilical vascular resistance was increased by infusion of U-46619 (r = 0.80). We conclude that umbilical artery waveform analysis is not an adequate predictor of acute changes in umbilical blood flow or vascular resistance.\r"

The presence of HBcAg in the major placental cytotypes was mostly limited to the trophoblastic lineage. Moreover the activated macrophages with their strong cytoplasmic reaction to the antigen phagocytosis play a remarkable role in the immune response. Because there are continuous channels that link the human amnion through the trophoblastic lineage, including the endovascular trophoblast with maternal decidual vessels, a functional exchange system may be considered valid. This would influence the transmission of infection.\r"

Blood flow velocity and pulse-wave curves with equal beat-to-beat intervals were synchronized by external fetal electrocardiogram. The systolic increase in blood flow velocity and in vessel diameter started simultaneously. The velocity peak preceded the diameter peak by a significant margin (p in the range 0.0001 to 0.0014). The time interval was more pronounced in the thoracic than in the abdominal part of the aorta and was slightly smaller near term. The effective diameter, calculated from the synchronized integrals of the blood flow velocity and the diameter curves, was significantly greater (p in the range 0.0001 to 0.0016) than the mean diameter. The difference tended to decrease with advancing gestational age and was more pronounced in the thoracic than in the abdominal aorta. The maximum error incurred by the use of nonsimultaneous measurements of blood flow velocity and vessel diameter when calculating volume blood flow was found to be less than 8% and thus probably of little practical importance.\r"

Blood pressure measurements were made with the Cambridge blood pressure telemetry system, which was composed of a Dinamap 1846 monitor linked to and controlled by a dedicated microprocessor which communicated transtelephonically with a hospital-based microcomputer. On each measurement day each woman measured her blood pressure five times: on first rising and then at 10 AM, 2 PM, 6 PM and 10 PM. At each measurement session the blood pressure was automatically taken 10 times at 1-minute intervals. A total of 23,790 individual blood pressure measurements were analyzed. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures were lowest at 18 weeks' gestation, rising slowly thereafter at a rate of 0.4 mm Hg systolic and 0.2 mm Hg diastolic per week. The maternal pulse rate also increased steadily after 18 weeks at a rate of 0.25 beats/min per week. There was a strong correlation between the blood pressures at 18, 26, and 38 weeks. All blood pressure parameters were significantly lower on first rising than at other times of the day, although the differences were small: 5 mm Hg for systolic, 4 mm Hg for mean arterial, and 3 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. After 10 AM, however, there was no significant daytime variation in any blood pressure parameter, indicating that for most purposes the time of day at which pressure measurements are made is unimportant.\r"

The weights of women with pregnancies affected by open spina bifida were found not to be different from unaffected pregnancies. Adjustment resulted in a net increase in detected cases at two commonly used cutoff points: 2.0 and 2.5 multiples of the median. At 2.0 multiples of the median, the detection rate increased from 80% to 84%, whereas at 2.5 multiples of the median the rate rose from 68% to 69%. Adjustment for maternal weight has previously been shown to reduce the false-positive rate in maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening for fetal open spina bifida by reducing variance in unaffected pregnancies; our data provide further support for consideration of maternal weight when interpreting material serum alpha-fetoprotein measurements.\r"

DESIGN: Patients were randomly assigned to oral fluconazole, 400 mg/d, for 10 weeks or to amphotericin B, 0.7 mg/kg body weight daily for 1 week, then three times weekly for 9 weeks combined with flucytosine, 150 mg/kg d, in four divided doses. SETTING: Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center. PATIENTS: Between 15 February and 7 December 1988, 42 patients had evidence of their first episode of cryptococcal meningitis, of whom 21 participated in the trial. All patients enrolled were men with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) except one woman who was receiving prednisone therapy and was excluded from the final analysis. RESULTS: Of 14 patients with AIDS assigned to fluconazole, 8 (57%; 95% CI, 29% to 82%) failed; none of the 6 patients with AIDS failed who were assigned to amphotericin B plus flucytosine therapy (0%; CI, 0% to 46%) (Fisher exact test, P = 0.04). The mean duration of positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures was 40.6 +/- 5.4 days in patients receiving fluconazole and 15.6 +/- 6.6 days in patients receiving amphotericin B plus flucytosine (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.02). Overall, 4 patients assigned to fluconazole therapy died whereas no patient assigned to amphotericin B plus flucytosine therapy died (Fisher exact test, P = 0.27). CONCLUSION: Amphotericin B used in combination with flucytosine has superior mycologic and clinical efficacy compared with fluconazole for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS.\r"

PATIENTS: One hundred and ninety-four elderly veterans who were identified as being hearing impaired from a screening survey involving 771 consecutive clinic patients. Of the original 194, 188 (97%) completed the trial. INTERVENTION: Subjects were randomly assigned to either receive a hearing aid (n = 95) or join a waiting list (n = 99). MAIN ENDPOINTS: A comprehensive battery of disease-specific and generic quality-of-life measures were administered at baseline, 6 weeks, and 4 months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Persons assigned to the two groups were similar in age, ethnicity, education, marital status, occupation, and comorbid diseases. At baseline, 82% of subjects reported adverse effects on quality of life due to hearing impairment, and 24% were depressed. At follow-up, a significant change in score improvements for social and emotional function (34.0; 95% CI, 27.3 to 40.8; P less than 0.0001), communication function (24.2; CI, 17.2 to 31.2; P less than 0.0001), cognitive function (0.28; CI, 0.08 to 0.48; P = 0.008), and depression (0.80; CI, 0.09 to 1.51; P = 0.03) was seen in subjects who received hearing aids compared with those assigned to the waiting list. Six drop-outs (three per group), no crossovers, and no significant changes in cointerventions were seen. Average, self-reported, daily aid use in the hearing aid group was 8 hours. CONCLUSION: Hearing loss is associated with important adverse effects on the quality of life of elderly persons, effects which are reversible with hearing aids.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To compare inhaled pentamidine with intravenous pentamidine for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). DESIGN: A randomized trial. SETTING: Community teaching hospital and hospital-based outpatient treatment center. PATIENTS: Twenty-one homosexual men with pneumocystis pneumonia; 11 received inhaled pentamidine and 10 received intravenous pentamidine. INTERVENTION: Inhaled (8 mg/kg body weight) or intravenous (4 mg/kg body weight) pentamidine administered daily for 21 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients responded to intravenous pentamidine, whereas 6 of 11 (55%; 95% CI, 23% to 83%; P = 0.02, Fisher exact test) responded to inhaled pentamidine therapy. Two patients who failed inhaled pentamidine therapy eventually died despite appropriate intravenous therapy (mortality rate, 18%; CI, -6% to 42%). Nonresponders to inhaled pentamidine had a greater severity of illness compared with responders to this therapy, as shown by a lower mean (+/- SE) Pao2 (8.0 +/- 0.4 kPa compared with 10.8 +/- 0.6 kPa; P = 0.005) and higher alveolararterial Po2 difference (6.8 +/- 0.6 kPa compared with 2.8 +/- 0.8 kPa; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled pentamidine is probably as effective as intravenous pentamidine in patients with mild pneumocystis pneumonia. However, its use as sole therapy in patients with moderate to severe pneumocystis pneumonia is not supported by the results of our study and is not warranted.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized open study with serial pulmonary function testing and measurement of pentamidine concentrations in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. PATIENTS: Of 44 men and 1 woman with a mild to moderate first episode of P. carinii pneumonia (Pao2 greater than or equal to 7.3 kPa [55 mm Hg]), 23 received aerosolized pentamidine and 22, intravenous pentamidine. INTERVENTIONS: Pentamidine isethionate, 600 mg by inhalation using a Respirgard II nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products, Inc., Englewood, Colorado) or 3 mg/kg body weight intravenously, administered once daily for 2 to 3 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The planned 60-patient study was stopped after 45 patients had been enrolled. The rates (aerosolized compared with intravenous pentamidine) of initial failure, early recrudescence of symptoms, and relapse were 12% and 19% (difference, 7%; 99% confidence interval [CI], - 23% to 37%; P = 0.67), 35% and 0% (difference, 35%; CI, 13% to 58%; P = 0.02), and 24% and 0% (difference, 24%; CI, 4% to 49%; P = 0.03). The rates (aerosolized compared with intravenous pentamidine) of major toxicity were 0% (0 of 17 patients) and 10% (2 of 21 patients) (difference 10%; CI, -1% to 29%; P = 0.24). The mean (+/- SD) pentamidine concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine was 96.6 +/- 65.1 ng/mL compared with 14.4 +/- 17.7 ng/mL for patients receiving intravenous treatment. Trough concentrations of pentamidine in plasma increased from 0 to 25.4 +/- 16.4, 56.5 +/- 26.1, and 61.1 +/- 56.0 ng/mL at the end of weeks 1, 2, and 3 of intravenous therapy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that reduced-dose intravenous pentamidine was more effective than aerosolized pentamidine for treating mild to moderate P. carinii pneumonia. Systemic absorption during aerosolized therapy was minimal; daily doses of intravenous pentamidine resulted in increased accumulation of pentamidine in plasma.\r"

  ".W": "Septic shock is the commonest cause of death in intensive care units. Although sepsis usually produces a low systemic vascular resistance and elevated cardiac output, strong evidence (decreased ejection fraction and reduced response to fluid administration) suggests that the ventricular myocardium is depressed and the ventricle dilated. In survivors, these abnormalities are reversible. Failure to develop ventricular dilatation in nonsurvivors suggests that dilatation is a compensatory mechanism needed to maintain adequate cardiac output. With a canine model of septic shock that is very similar to human sepsis, myocardial depression was confirmed using load-independent measures of ventricular performance. Endotoxin administration to humans simulates the qualitative, cardiovascular abnormalities of sepsis. The pathogenesis of septic shock is extraordinarily complex. Diverse microorganisms can generate toxins, stimulating release of potent mediators that act on vasculature and myocardium. A circulating myocardial depressant substance has been closely associated with the myocardial depression of human septic shock. Therapy has emphasized early use of antibiotics, critical care monitoring, aggressive volume resuscitation, and, if shock continues, use of inotropic agents and vasopressors. Pharmacologic or immunologic antagonism of endotoxin or other mediators may prove to enhance survival in this highly lethal syndrome.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies published from 1966 to 1989 were identified through a MEDLINE computer search and an extensive manual search of the bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: We found 11 randomized studies (10 of which were placebo controlled) that assessed mortality in hospitalized patients diagnosed with acute alcoholic hepatitis and treated with corticosteroids. DATA EXTRACTION: Two critical appraisers independently evaluated trial quality and abstracted quantitative data on clinical characteristics of the populations, interventions, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Overall, the protective efficacy (or percent reduction in mortality) of corticosteroids was 37% (95% CI, 20% to 50%). Protective efficacy was higher among trials with higher quality scores and trials that excluded subjects with active gastrointestinal bleeding. In subjects with hepatic encephalopathy, protective efficacy was 34% overall (CI, 15% to 48%). It was also higher among trials with higher quality scores and trials excluding subjects with acute gastrointestinal bleeding, but was not present among trials with lower quality scores or trials that did not exclude subjects with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. In subjects without hepatic encephalopathy, corticosteroids had no protective effect, and this lack of efficacy was consistent across all trial subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that corticosteroids reduce short-term mortality in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis who have hepatic encephalopathy, that the protective effect depends on the exclusion criterion of acute gastrointestinal bleeding and is influenced by trial quality, and that corticosteroids are of no benefit in patients without hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

Present data support the hypothesis that altered presynaptic glutamatergic mechanisms may be responsible for a neuroexcitotoxic cell loss in this disorder. High local concentrations of glycine, released from glycinergic terminals, may disrupt adaptive processes contributing to abnormal potentiation of excitatory transmission mediated by glutamate receptors and resultant selective degeneration of motor neurons. These considerations offer new therapeutic strategies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\r"

  ".U": "90328722\r", 
  ".W": "Brain tissue from 11 patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, changes of Alzheimer's disease, and variable degrees of subcortical leukoencephalopathy was examined by immunohistochemical methods, using primary antibodies to peptide segments representing portions of the Alzheimer A4 (beta-) peptide or gamma-trace peptide (seen most commonly in Icelandic patients with cerebral hemorrhage (hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis [HCHWA-I]). Variable A4 immunostaining was seen within cortical (and rarely white matter) parenchyma in the form of senile plaques (with or without central cores), and within capillary and arteriolar walls. Within individual patients, A4 deposits were often primarily parenchymal or vascular, and when they were vascular they tended to be more prominent in arteriolar than in capillary wall segments. Perivascular A4 deposits were often detected around strongly immunoreactive microvessels. Gamma-trace immunoreactivity was noted in many A4-positive microvessel walls, but staining was always less intense than with the anti-A4 antibody. We conclude that patients with severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy may show wide variation in the severity and topography of A4 deposits within brain parenchyma. A4 may colocalize with gamma-trace peptide, suggesting that A4 and gamma-trace forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy may not be as biochemically distinctive as has been suggested. Other proteases or protease inhibitors may contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy or cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related stroke syndromes.\r"

However the increasing prevalence and virulence of these bacteria prompt reconsideration of this view, particularly because the surgical patient has become increasingly vulnerable to infectious morbidity due to debility, immunosuppression, and therapy with increasingly potent antibiotics. The enterococcus is a versatile opportunistic nosocomial pathogen, causing such diverse infections as wound, intra-abdominal, and urinary tract infections; catheter-associated infection; suppurative thrombophlebitis; endocarditis; and pneumonia. Although surgical drainage remains the cornerstone of therapy for enterococcal infections involving a discrete focus, in the circumstances typified by the compromised surgical patient, specific antibacterial therapy directed against the enterococcus is warranted. Recent evidence indicates that parenteral antibiotic therapy for enterococcal bacteremia is mandatory and that appropriate therapy clearly reduces the number of deaths.\r"

  ".W": "We postulated that locoregional recurrence after limited surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer might be associated with an additional survival hazard, similar to that of a second primary tumor with the same extent of local and regional disease. Using this hypothesis we examined the likely resultant effect on survival. Our calculations indicated that no statistically significant survival deficit due to such recurrence would be detectable until a randomized controlled trial comparing breast conservation with mastectomy had monitored more than 10,000 patients for more than 10 years. A simple mathematical model predicted 5-year survival rates in a cohort of patients treated with breast conservation of 75%, compared to 83% in those without locoregional recurrence. From the date of locoregional recurrence, a 61% 5-year survival rate was predicted, compared to 83% if no hazard was associated with locoregional recurrence. These predictions were compared with the actuarial survival rates of 499 patients with unilateral breast cancer, 49 of whom had developed locoregional recurrence. From the date of initial treatment, the 5-year survival rate of those whose disease recurred was 79%, compared to 88% for those without locoregional recurrence (p = 0.19). The actuarial 5-year survival rate from the date of locoregional recurrence was 63%. The similarity between the patient data and the predictions of the mathematical model indicates that locoregional failure after breast conservation therapy may result in reduced survival. The lack of a significant survival deficit in our cohort or in controlled trials comparing breast conservation therapy with mastectomy is compatible to the small size of the overall effect.\r"

  ".U": "90328795\r", 
  ".W": "Advancing age tends to be accompanied by predictable changes in organ-system function and body composition, as well as an increased prevalence of various diseases. Our knowledge of the metabolic responses to surgical stress is derived largely from studies of young and middle-aged individuals. Whether these responses are altered in the elderly is not well established; the characteristic changes in metabolic function and body composition that occur in the elderly may limit their ability to respond adequately and to survive severe or complicated surgical procedures. To evaluate the effects of age and differences in body composition on the metabolic responses to surgery, we studied 20 active and otherwise healthy men aged 43 to 77 years, before and after elective colon resection. Age was not related to weight or total body water (TBW) in the patients studied. Resting preoperative energy expenditure was strongly dependent on TBW (reflecting lean body mass) and age (r2 = 0.80, p less than 0.001), and to TBW and creatinine excretion (reflecting muscle mass) (r2 = 0.85, p less than 0.001). Energy expenditure increased 18 +/- 2% (range, 4% to 40%) after operation but this response was unrelated to age. Postoperative urine nitrogen was related to body weight or TBW, but not to age. Serum glucose, cortisol, white blood cell count count, and C-reactive protein responses were also independent of patient age. The metabolic responses of generally healthy men to a moderate surgical stress do not vary with age in the range studied. The metabolic responses to more severe or prolonged stress may be altered with advancing age and changes in body composition, and in patients with concomitant diseases.\r"

The thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine, which is detectable by immunohistochemical examination, allows evaluation of epithelial proliferation within 3 days. Pinch rectal biopsy specimens, from the unprepared bowel, are incubated under 1 atm additional pressure in a medium containing bromodeoxyuridine. The tissue is then fixed in 70% ethanol and embedded in paraffin, and the slides are prepared. The labeled nuclei are revealed using indirect immunoperoxidase staining and are easily counted by light microscopy. Assessment of proliferation is rapidly available for determining cancer risk and response in ongoing experimental and human dietary intervention studies.\r"

Among the extramammary cases, the cells in 6 cases were immunoreactive. In 4 of these positive extramammary cases, dermal invasion and metastases of regional lymph nodes were observed. Another 2 extramammary cases were weakly reactive. An enhanced expression of ras p21 therefore seems to depend on the region of the tumor or on the biologic behavior.

The Km-values for ethanol of ADH isoenzymes relevant for alcohol degradation range from 49 microM to 36 microM, and the Vmax-values from 0.6 to 10 U/mg. Expression of an inactive form of the ALDH2 isoenzyme, the so-called Oriental variant, results in impaired acetaldehyde metabolizing capacity. The differences in ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolizing activities of allelic enzyme forms may be responsible in part for the large variation in the alcohol metabolism rate in humans. Interindividual differences in the isoenzyme pattern may contribute to the genetically determined predisposition for excessive alcohol intake.\r"

Both the rate and efficiency of ATP synthesis via the oxidative phosphorylation system are decreased. Alterations in the activities of several components of the oxidative phosphorylation system contribute to the overall decrease in the capacity for ATP synthesis. There appears to be no alteration in any particular component which is rate-limiting. Although changes in membrane lipids may play a minor role, it appears that the decreased levels of mitochondria-derived polypeptide components of the oxidative phosphorylation system are primarily responsible for the depression in both the rate and efficiency of ATP synthesis. The concentrations of these mitochondrial gene products are lowered due to effects of chronic ethanol consumption on the mitochondrial translational process.\r"

  ".U": "90329061\r", 
  ".W": "In recent years, ethanol has been shown to interact with membrane-associated signal transduction mechanisms which rely on the reaction of phospholipases with their phospholipid substrates in the membrane. In several cell and membrane preparations, ethanol activates the polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C and triggers the complete battery of intracellular signalling responses that are characteristic for hormones acting through this pathway, including the formation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, the release of Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites with the consequent activation of cytosolic Ca2(+)-dependent enzymes, and the formation of diacylglycerol leading to the stimulation of protein kinase C. The activation of phospholipase C appears to be due to an interaction of ethanol with the intramembrane complex of receptor-G-protein-phospholipase C, presumably promoting the release of bound GDP and the binding of GTP to activate the G-protein which controls phospholipase C activity. In many intact cells, the phospholipase C is subject to a feedback inhibitory control by protein kinase C. In liver cells, ethanol also triggers this feedback inhibition, leading to a rapid decline in the phospholipase C activation; at the same time, ethanol also causes the desensitization of the response to vasopressin and other phospholipase C-linked agonists. At hormone concentrations in the physiological range, the heterologous desensitization by ethanol of the agonist-mediated phospholipase C activation may be a significant factor at ethanol concentrations that are readily attained in vivo. Further interaction of ethanol with the intracellular second messenger system is mediated through a hormone-sensitive phospholipase D. This enzyme uses phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid which can be further converted to diacylglycerol. In the presence of ethanol the enzyme catalyzes the transphosphatidylation to phosphatidylethanol. It is not clear, however, under what conditions this process could affect the normal pattern of formation of second messenger molecules. After chronic ethanol intake, a tolerance can develop at the cellular level to the effects of ethanol on agonist-induced signal transduction processes. However, the mechanism by which this tolerance develops is currently a matter of conjecture. Studies on liver cells indicate that the activity of protein kinase C may play a role in the development of this type of tolerance to ethanol. A better understanding of the interaction of ethanol with these phospholipid-dependent signal transduction processes could point to mechanisms by which ethanol could interfere with physiological control mechanism in a variety of cells and tissues.\r"

Although such a system was proposed already two decades ago, its role was viewed with skepticism: until recently, it was commonly believed that the primary pathway for hepatic ethanol metabolism is due almost exclusively to the activity of cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase, with a minor contribution from peroxisomal catalase. It is now recognized, however, that liver microsomes (through MEOS) participate in ethanol metabolism. The existence of this system and its inducibility contribute to the metabolic tolerance to ethanol in the alcoholic. Cross induction of other microsomal enzymes also explains the tolerance to many commonly used drugs. Most importantly, the alcohol-inducible form (P450IIE1) has a unique capacity to activate xenobiotic agents to toxic metabolites, thereby explaining the unusual susceptibility of the alcoholic to the adverse effects of other drugs, hepatotoxic agents, carcinogens and even vitamins.\r"

This chronic myopathy is characterized by a selective reduction in Type II (fast twitch) fibre area; Type I (slow twitch) fibres are relatively unaffected. The myopathy is not mediated by the patients' corticosteroid and nutritional status, liver dysfunction or neurological changes, and there is little correlation between alcoholic myopathy and alcohol intake. However, plasma alpha-tocopherol and selenium levels in myopathic alcoholics are reduced. The myopathy may in some way be related to the reduced fractional rates of skeletal muscle protein synthesis that occur in alcohol misusers and implicates free radical reactions in the pathogenesis of the myopathy. We have established a rat model of chronic alcoholic myopathy. In this model anatomically distinct skeletal muscles were taken to represent Type I (i.e. soleus) or Type II (i.e. plantaris) fibres. There were selective losses of Type II muscle protein at the end of 6 weeks of ethanol feeding. These changes were also not apparently mediated by nutritional limitations, neurological changes or liver dysfunction. Skeletal muscle protein synthesis was also reduced, as was plasma alpha tocopherol and selenium levels. Thus the rat model is amendable for further work to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for alcohol-induced muscle loss.\r"

Treatment with propylthiouracil and insulin and glucagon infusions has also shown promising results in controlled studies but there is still no general agreement on their value. Despite recent interest in the use of colchicine to prevent progression of cirrhosis in chronic liver disease of other aetiologies, its role in alcoholic liver disease is not yet clear. In end-stage alcoholic cirrhosis, excellent results are now being achieved with liver transplantation, although this is limited to patients who are not alcohol dependent and in whom there is no alcohol-induced extrahepatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "There are wide ranging effects of alcohol on the nervous system. Some interfere with physiological and neurochemical functions but ultimately structural damage occurs. During life one of the most impressive changes is brain shrinkage which can be visualized using neuroradiological imaging techniques. This article reviews the pathological explanations for brain shrinkage and addresses the question of the pathogenesis of the reversible component of this damage in relation to prolonged abstinence from alcohol. This shrinkage seems to relate to a loss of white matter. However, the cortex is also abnormal in that there is a loss of neurones from the frontal region. In this and other regions of the cortex examined there is shrinkage of the neuronal soma. This is reflected in a retraction of the neuronal dendritic arbor which plays a crucial role in cell-to-cell communication. In addition, the cerebellum appears to be vulnerable in alcoholic patients although it may well be that associated nutritional deficiencies play an important role. The Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is another important deficiency disorder which is seen most frequently in alcoholic patients. Two important population groups which are considered in this review are females and moderate ('social') drinkers. Females are thought to be more susceptible to the damaging effects of alcohol than males and this is examined in the light of the scant data available. Similarly, there are few neuropathological data on people who drink 30-80 grams of alcohol per day. In order to assess so-called 'safe levels of drinking' this is an important group to study.\r"

  ".U": "90329067\r", 
  ".W": "1. Acetaldehyde has been implicated in the pathogenesis of alcohol-related liver damage by two mechanisms. Adduct formation with many tissue constituents, especially proteins, makes them immunologically foreign or reduces enzyme activity and formation of cytotoxic free radicals from acetaldehyde metabolism. Adduct formation damage to microtubule associated proteins and to hepatocyte membranes impedes protein movement into, out of and around the cell. 2. Evidence that these mechanisms also have a role in alcoholic brain damage includes raised blood acetaldehyde in alcoholics, especially in those chemically dependent, or in other abnormal states; effects of extra-hepatic free radical toxicity, including induction of superoxide dismutase activity and damaged, abnormal variants of the thiamin-dependent enzyme transketolase and extrahepatic acetaldehyde-adduct formation with haemoglobin. That acetaldehyde-mediated impairment of microtubule systems also damages the brain is suggested by its importance for the maintenance by protein transport of often greatly extended brain cell processes. 3. Oxygen-derived free radicals can damage brain tissue, the effects including cerebral oedema, neuronal loss and damage to the blood-brain barrier, all changes also reported in the brains from alcoholic patients. Alcohol-related pathology in the brain differing from that in the liver, shows sharper regional variations in vulnerability and adverse effects due to nutritional deficiencies, especially of B-group vitamins. Even though some such deficits are capable of causing encephalopathy in the non-alcoholic, the strong association between them and chronic alcoholism points to possible aggravation by metabolic interactions at various levels between acetaldehyde and thiamin or other B-vitamins. Selective regional vulnerability may reflect differences in ease of acetaldehyde access or to important metabolic differences. Alteration of animal behaviour by acetaldehyde points to a need to correlate clinical evidence of acetaldehyde central nervous cytotoxicity with the incidence of different types of cognitive defect.\r"

  ".W": "An ethanol-induced oxidative stress is not restricted to the liver, where ethanol is actively oxidized, but can affect various extrahepatic tissues as shown by experimental data obtained in the rat during acute or chronic ethanol intoxication. Most of these data concern the central nervous system, the heart and the testes. An acute ethanol load has been reported to enhance lipid peroxidation in the cerebellum. This is accompanied by an increase in the cytosolic concentration of low-molecular-weight iron derivatives which may contribute to the generation of aggressive free radicals. The ethanol-induced decrease in the main antioxidant systems (superoxide dismutase, alpha-tocopherol, ascorbate and selenium) is a likely contributor to the cerebellar oxidative stress. Most of these disturbances can be prevented by allopurinol administration. Some experimental data support also the occurrence of pro- and anti-oxidant disturbances in the cerebellum and in other regions of the central nervous system after chronic ethanol administration. Chronic ethanol administration enhances lipid peroxidation in the heart. The increased conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase into xanthine oxidase as well as the activation of peroxisomal acyl CoA-oxidase linked to ethanol administration could contribute to the oxidative stress. Chronic ethanol administration elicits in the testes an enhancement in mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and a decrease in the glutathione level, which appear to be correlated to the gross testicular atrophy observed. Vitamin A supplementation attenuates the changes in lipid peroxidation, glutathione and testicular morphology. Whether the reported disturbances are involved in the pathogenesis of the tissue disorders observed in alcoholic patients remains unanswered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Future studies on the central actions of alcohol and on alcohol dependence should therefore be directed at the molecular changes in synaptic membrane-bound components such as neurotransmitter receptors, as well as on neurotransmitter release and relevant membrane-bound enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "Research on the interaction of ethanol (ET) and stress published since 1981 is reviewed. Chronic physical stressors were found to increase the ingestion of ET compared to nonstressed animals. With foodshock, ingestion of ET decreased during the stress session but rose afterwards. The elevation of ET ingestion produced by daily immobilization was long-lasting and was related to individual initial preference for ET. Psychological stressors also increased ingestion of ET. In rat colonies, dominant rats ingested less ET, whereas submissive rats had the highest intake. Factors that modify the ingestion of ET include neonatal experience and REM sleep deprivation. Early weaning increased, while postnatal handling decreased preference for ET. The effect of postnatal handling may be influenced by genetics. Stress, applied during adult life or prenatally, modifies some, but not all, the acute effects of ET. There were marked individual differences in the interaction of ET and stress with respect to ingestion of ET. Conversely, ET may modify stress-induced behavioural and neurochemical changes. This interaction may be stressor specific. Some stressors increase the ET's effects, whereas others may decrease or not affect them. In brain, ET has been shown to lessen the stress-induced decrease in noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) levels and those in noradrenaline turnover and alpha 1-receptor binding. Stress-induced changes in plasma catecholamines, corticosterone, non-esterified fatty acids and amino acids, and in the decline in adrenal catecholamines are also lessened by pretreatment with ET. Possible mechanisms for the ET-stress interaction are discussed. These include mediation via the GABA-benzodiazepine-ionophore complex, endogenous opioids, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and the noradrenergic system.\r"

Quite recently, human studies have supported such animal findings to the extent that now we need to question even more strongly our approach required for counselling on alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\r"

It is concluded that chronic heavy drinking or alcohol consumption levels consistent with alcohol dependence or alcohol-related liver disease does damage the immune system. In addition alcohol consumption influences sexual behaviour for a variety of psychological, social and physical reasons. Attention is focused on the disinhibiting effects of alcohol and the popular belief that drinking may be used to facilitate or excuse otherwise unacceptable behaviour. Several studies indicate that alcohol consumption is associated with 'high risk' sexual behaviour. Accordingly drinking appears to be a risk factor for potential exposure to HIV infection and for relapse into 'high risk' sexual activities. Evidence does not support the conclusion that alcohol is a cofactor in the course of AIDS-related illnesses.\r"

Over the past three decades, several stress equations giving radically different results have been derived, used, and/or espoused. They can be classified into two categories, according to the definition of stress underlying the equation. The stresses in one class of equations are total forces per unit normal area, excluding ambient pressure but including pressure in the wall exerted by more external elements of the wall. The stresses in the other class of equations are fiber-pulling forces per unit normal area, that is, total forces per unit normal area excluding all pressure. The validity of stress equations can be tested at least three ways: 1) Do they predict that the pressure inside a small chamber nested in a larger chamber would be the sum of transmural pressures of the two chambers? 2) Do they satisfy the expectation from Laplace's law that a sphere with a given circular stress and thickness/radius ratio would exert twice the pressure of a cylinder with the same circular stress and thickness/radius ratio? 3) Do they predict that the ratio of principle stresses depends on chamber shape but not on wall/cavity ratio, with the circular/longitudinal stress ratio of a cylinder being 2 and that of a prolate spheroid being between 1 and 2? Stress equations of the first class fail all of these tests by large margins, whereas those of the second class pass all of these tests exactly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dietary protein intake did not affect mean arterial pressure, but renal blood flow was increased in the HP rats and decreased in the LP rats compared with the control rats. Mesenteric blood flow was not significantly different in the three diet groups. Captopril (10 mg.kg-1 i.v.) had no effect on renal vascular resistance in the HP rat but did reduce the elevated renal vascular resistance seen in the LP rat. Meclofenamate (5 mg.kg-1 i.v.) did not significantly affect renal hemodynamics in either HP or LP rats. Finally, the HP rat exhibited resistance to the systemic pressor, renal, and mesenteric vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II. Captopril restored the systemic pressor and the mesenteric vasoconstrictor response but not the renal vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin II. Meclofenamate, on the other hand, restored both the systemic pressor response and the renal vasoconstrictor response. Thus, in the LP rat, the vascular response to angiotensin II remains intact, and renal vasoconstriction appears to be mediated by angiotensin II. In contrast, in the HP rat, the renovascular response to angiotensin II is blunted apparently because of enhanced renal prostaglandin production. However, neither increased renal prostaglandin synthesis nor blunting of the renovascular response to angiotensin II appears to account for the chronic vasodilation seen in the HP rat.\r"

  ".W": "Several alterations in plasma active renin, inactive renin (prorenin), and aldosterone have been described in patients with diabetes mellitus. Such changes could be of some importance for patients on hemodialysis treatment, who must undergo severe changes in fluid and electrolyte status during each dialysis session. Therefore we studied the response of renin and aldosterone to hemodialysis in uremic diabetic nephropathy patients, using direct immunometric assays to measure plasma active renin concentration (ARC), inactive renin concentration (IRC), total renin concentration (TRC), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in 11 male patients aged 39-69 (mean 53 +/- 2) with diabetic nephropathy and 11 male age-matched non-diabetics who had been on maintenance hemodialysis for 1-10 years. Although baseline values of IRC were slightly higher, and values of PAC lower in diabetics compared to non-diabetics, the results did not reach statistical significance. During hemodialysis, significant increases in ARC (p less than 0.01), TRC (p less than 0.05), and PRA (p less than 0.01), and a significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in PAC were seen in non-diabetic patients but no significant changes were observed in patients with diabetic nephropathy. IRC did not change during hemodialysis in either group of patients. There were no significant differences in body weight, blood pressure, or electrolyte changes in the two groups. These results suggest an altered response of plasma renin and aldosterone to hemodialysis in patients with diabetic nephropathy compared to non-diabetics. The reduced renin response could not be explained by a defect in conversion from inactive renin, but may be caused by decreased secretion of active renin in these patients.\r"

Early in utero diagnosis is now possible using maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound. As with other serious congenital disorders, antenatal diagnosis allows therapeutic options and time for preparation. Even if the diagnosis is made late, however, efforts to achieve prenatal maternal transport are still reasonable. The neonatal outcome of an unplanned delivery of an anomalous child requiring immediate attention is likely to be better if the delivery occurs in a tertiary center. These facilities generally have specialized services and teams available for critical care around the clock. The authors describe the maternal transport and delivery of a neonate with a serious disorder that required specialized attention at an hour when most hospitals are staffed with a skeleton crew. The necessary resources were available immediately, and the neonatal outcome was favorable. Although this report describes gastroschisis specifically, the concept of tertiary site delivery for potentially seriously ill neonates applies to any condition. With a late diagnosis, possible other anomalies, and a logistically unfavorable hour, the advantages of maternal transport are evident. This report also briefly reviews the area of antenatal ultrasound diagnosis and the newer mechanisms used to develop a perinatal care plan.\r"

These steroid-induced mental changes may be underrecognized in children, and yet these changes can have considerable impact on social and psychological functioning and treatment outcome. An enhanced awareness and reporting of this phenomenon by clinicians, parents, and teachers would likely lead to better compliance with treatment, improved outcomes, and greater understanding of emotional concomitants of illness.\r"

In the past year, we treated three patients with documented PCP subsequently complicated by multiple spontaneous pneumothoraces. All patients underwent open surgical repair. In contrast to traditional pathologic findings of PCP in AIDS, histologic sections of lung from each patient consistently demonstrated an extensive interstitial inflammatory process with destruction of lung tissue primarily involving the periphery of the lung. Subpleural necrosis with bleb formation as well as bullous changes persisted even in the absence of an alveolar filling process. We conclude that the mechanism for pneumothorax in PCP is spontaneous rupture of necrotic lung tissue occurring in a subgroup of AIDS patients in which the interstitial inflammatory response to Pneumocystis has been accelerated.\r"

We performed a randomized, double-blind trial to assess the incremental benefit over 24 hours of adding ipratropium vs placebo to a standardized regimen of medications commonly used in the acute and subsequent hospital management of COPD and asthma. Sixty-eight subjects received nebulized salbutamol, intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous aminophylline, and antibiotics and were randomized to receive either 80 micrograms of ipratropium or placebo via metered dose inhaler and spacing device with each salbutamol treatment (6 to 8 times per day). Among the 50 patients who completed the study, there were no significant differences between ipratropium and placebo groups with respect to baseline FEV1, FVC, and PaCO2. The improvement of FEV1 from baseline to 24 hours was 294 (SD = 568) ml in the ipratropium group vs 393 (SD = 622) ml in placebo group. Adjusting FEV1 by age, gender, and smoking did not significantly alter the findings. Those with an admission diagnosis of asthma showed larger 24 hour FEV1 responses (487 ml in ipratropium vs 801 ml in placebo) than those with COPD (149 ml ipratropium vs 102 ml in placebo). However, within these two strata, there were no significant differences in FEV1 improvement between ipratropium and placebo groups. This study suggests that if ipratropium is used in the initial emergency treatment of COPD or asthma, it could safely be discontinued by 24 hours in order to reduce the cost and complexity of therapy.\r"

We hypothesized that the forces acting to collapse the upper airway during inspiration and expiration are of different magnitudes and that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing events (including apneas, hypopneas and nonapneic desaturation events) could be eliminated at lower levels of EPAP than IPAP. To test these hypotheses, a device was built that allows the independent adjustment of EPAP and IPAP (nasal BiPAP). Our data support the hypotheses that expiratory phase events are important in the pathogenesis of OSA and that there are differences in the magnitudes of the forces destabilizing the upper airway during inspiration and expiration. Finally, applying these concepts, we have shown that by using a device that permits independent adjustment of EPAP and IPAP, obstructive sleep-disordered breathing can be eliminated at lower levels of expiratory airway pressure compared with conventional nasal CPAP therapy. This may reduce the adverse effects associated with nasal CPAP therapy and improve long-term therapeutic compliance.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare the benefits of nasal CPAP, nasal oxygen (O2), and placebo (air) using patients as their own controls. We studied eight men, aged 33 to 72 (mean 57 years), who had mild obstructive sleep apnea. To be eligible for study, patients had to have an apnea plus hypopnea index greater than or equal to 5, plus one or more of the following: blood pressure greater than 150/95 mm Hg, multiple sleep latency test mean score less than or equal to 10 minutes, or significant nocturnal cardiac ectopy. After a baseline study, patients received a month each of nocturnal O2 at 4 LPM and air at 4 LPM, presented in random order. The third month of treatment consisted of nasal CPAP (range 2.5 to 12.5 cm H2O). Patients underwent evaluation at baseline and after each month of treatment. It was concluded that oxygen was more effective in improving oxygenation and hypopneas than is nasal CPAP. However, oxygen did not reduce apneas or improve daytime hypersomnolence as well as nasal CPAP in patients with mild OSA. Oxygen might be considered as an alternate form of treatment for patients who are not hypersomnolent, or as an adjunct to nasal CPAP.\r"

In all patients, we performed nocturnal polysomnography, maximum inspiratory and maximum expiratory flow-volume curves. The curves were examined for two features: 1) presence of flow oscillations (the \"saw-tooth\" sign), and 2) changes in their configuration that might suggest upper airway obstruction as documented by the expiratory/inspiratory flow ratios calculated at 50 and 75 percent of exhaled vital capacity (FR50 and FR25, respectively). Based on the results of nocturnal polysomnography, the patients were stratified according to severity into apnea groups, and the flow ratios and flow oscillations were compared among these groups. We found that neither the FR50 nor FR25 were significantly different among the groups. Inspiratory and expiratory flow oscillations were seen infrequently (32 patients) and tended to occur in patients with more severe sleep apnea. Neither the flow ratios nor the flow oscillations had good predictive values for snoring or sleep apnea. The sensitivity of the flow volume curve abnormalities ranged between 0 and 14 percent, but the specificity was high, ranging between 93 and 95 percent. We conclude that because of low sensitivity, flow-volume loops are not a useful screening test for the diagnosis of OSA in snoring patients.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary nocardiosis is a well-described infection in immunocompromised patients; however, it is less well documented in patients with AIDS. The pulmonary manifestation in 21 HIV-positive patients who developed pulmonary infection with Nocardia asteroides is described. The radiographic picture included lobar or multilobar consolidation (52 percent [11/21]), solitary masses (24 percent [5/21]), reticulonodular infiltrates (33 percent [7/21]), and pleural effusion (33 percent [7/21]). Cavitation was common (62 percent [13/21]), and upper lobes were more commonly involved (71 percent [15/21]). Although the radiographic picture is variable, nocardiosis should be suspected in an HIV-positive patient who has subacute pulmonary disease with an unexplained lung mass or cavitary lesions.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the clinical utility of airway carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentrations to distinguish malignant from inflammatory airway disease in patients undergoing bronchoscopy, we determined CEA concentrations by enzyme immunoassay in bronchial washings recovered in 48 subjects, including 20 patients with central lung cancer, 18 patients with chronic bronchitis, and ten nonsmoking patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia or peripheral granuloma. Concentrations of CEA in bronchial washings were standardized by using the total protein concentration in recovered fluid (CEA/TP). Concentrations of CEA were significantly increased in bronchial washings recovered from both patients with chronic bronchitis and lung cancer compared with patients with pneumonia or granuloma (252 +/- 47 ng/mg and 199 +/- 64 ng/ml vs 62 +/- 11 ng/mg, SEM, p less than 0.005). Airway CEA concentrations in patients with chronic bronchitis were somewhat increased compared with concentrations recovered from a cancer-involved airway (252 +/- 47 ng/ml vs 199 +/- 64 ng/mg, SEM, p less than 0.05). Measurement of airway CEA concentrations is not useful in distinguishing malignant from inflammatory airway disease as airway concentrations of CEA may be markedly increased in patients with both conditions.\r"

  ".W": "We wanted to determine the long-term effects of a continuous infusion of PGE1 on DO2 and VO2 in patients with ARDS. Data were obtained from a randomized double-blind multicenter trial, which evaluated the effects of PGE1 on survival in patients with ARDS. Patients were stratified according to treatment and outcome: placebo-died (n = 8); PGE1-died (n = 12); placebo-survived (n = 9); and PGE1-survived (n = 8). In the placebo-died group, elevations occurred in VO2, which were associated with increases in O2ext and a constant DO2. In contrast, in the PGE1-died group, elevations in VO2 were associated with increases in DO2 and an unchanged O2ext. In the placebo-survived group, VO2 and DO2 decreased, whereas in the PGE1-survived group, VO2 and DO2 increased; however, O2ext decreased in both of these groups. Since impaired O2ext occurs in ARDS, PGE1-induced elevations in DO2, rather than compensatory increases in O2ext, may achieve better tissue oxygenation. We conclude that although the recently completed multicenter trial failed to show an enhancing effect of PGE1 on survival in patients with advanced ARDS, PGE1 may have important effects on oxygen transport and, therefore, may still have a role in the treatment of early manifestations of ARDS, either alone or in combination with other agents.\r"

  ".W": "The oxygen cost of breathing and the time integral of the transdiaphragmatic pressure were measured at the onset of the weaning period in eight patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring mechanical ventilation. Measurements were achieved during continuous positive airway pressure ventilation and during 15 cmH2O pressure support ventilation. For both periods, the O2COB was estimated as the difference between oxygen uptake of the period and that during controlled ventilation. During CPAP ventilation, the O2COB was 16.9 +/- 1.5 percent. During PSV, it was only 6.3 +/- 1.3 percent, and PTdi decreased by 73 percent compared to the CPAP period. Both effects illustrate the ability of PSV to facilitate spontaneous breathing during weaning from mechanical ventilation. However, we found these measurements to be of no help in predicting the duration of the weaning process.\r"

  ".W": "The preoperative staging of rectal cancer has important implications for treatment as local therapies become increasingly utilized. Seventy-seven patients underwent preoperative staging using endorectal ultrasonography. All patients had complete pathologic staging and none had preoperative radiotherapy. Depth of invasion of the tumor was accurately predicted in 75 percent of cases in the entire group, with 22 percent overstaged and 3 percent understaged. Accuracy improved greatly over the study period, and in the past six months, 95 percent have been accurately staged for depth of invasion with 5 percent overstaged. Lymph nodes have been properly classified into positive and negative groups in 88 percent of cases in the past year, with a specificity of 90 percent and a sensitivity of 88 percent. Endorectal ultrasound is an accurate preoperative staging modality. Accuracy is improved greatly with increased experience and it has been found that the 5-layer anatomical model facilitates accurate staging. Introduction of the ultrasound probe through a previously placed proctoscope ensures complete scanning of the entire lesion and should be used for the majority of examinations.\r"
