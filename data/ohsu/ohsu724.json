  ".W": "In an effort to define the mechanisms regulating pulmonary vasodilatation and explain the greater in vitro response to iso-proterenol in the pulmonary artery (PA) vs. aorta (AO), we compared beta adrenergic receptor binding characteristics and coupling to adenylate cyclase in PA and AO obtained from adult male rats. Beta adrenergic receptor binding characteristics and affinity for agonists were determined with [125I]-iodocyanopindolol. Agonist displacement studies were characteristic of a beta-2 adrenergic receptor subtype. Receptor density (44.7 +/- 7.3 vs. 39.6 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg of protein means +/- S.E.M., PA vs. AO) and the dissociation constant for the radioligand (10.3 +/- 2.6 vs. 13.4 +/- 3.5 pM) were similar in the two arteries. However, affinity for l-isoproterenol was greater (the inhibition constant was lower) in PA compared to AO (0.08 +/- 0.03 vs. 1.20 +/- 0.18 microM, P less than .05), as was affinity for l-epinephrine (0.89 +/- 0.20 vs. 3.87 +/- 0.62 microM, P less than .05). Affinity was similar for l-norepinephrine (18.93 +/- 3.63 vs. 13.49 +/- 3.12 microM). Base-line cyclic AMP (cAMP) content, basal adenylate cyclase activity and adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by GTP, isoproterenol plus GTP and forskolin were measured by radioimmunoassay for cAMP. Base-line cAMP content was greater in PA than in AO (513.5 +/- 46.9 vs. 125.5 +/- 19.1 pmol of cAMP per mg of protein, P less than .001), as was basal adenylate cyclase activity (10.8 +/- 1.2 vs. 5.7 +/- 1.3 pmol of cAMP per mg of protein per min, P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Postoperatively the patients were assigned randomly to one of three study groups. Group 1 received a daily saline injection to the bladder (control group, n = 24), group 2 received daily intravesical injections of 250 mg of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) (n =23), and group 3 received a daily 10-mg PGE2 (PGE2) vaginal suppository (n = 22). The patients' suprapubic catheter was removed once the postvoiding residual urine volume was less than or equal to 50 mL. Both PGE2 and PGF2 significantly reduced the length of time required for postoperative bladder drainage after both the Burch and Pereyra procedures as compared to that in the control group (P less than .05). Hospital stay and bacteriuria were reduced as well in women receiving postoperative prostaglandins as compared to the control group. Clinically there were no differences between PGE2 and PGF2 alpha. Both produced no side effects, were well tolerated by the patients and were effective in reducing both the number of days required for bladder catheterization and the incidence of significant bacteriuria when administered after the surgical procedures.\r"

  ".W": "Salpingostomy is the preferred surgical method of managing ectopic gestation when patients desire future fertility. Problems with that technique stem principally from difficulties with hemostasis. While ligation of a single mesosalpingeal vessel has been described, blood to the site of the ectopic gestation is supplied primarily by the tubal branch of the ovarian artery. We developed a technique for ligating that vessel at both ends of the ectopic site. The technique may be combined with mesosalpingeal vessel ligation and leads to excellent hemostasis. Although blood vessels to the tube are interrupted, tubal length is preserved. Salpingostomy is thus possible, even in cases of large, actively bleeding or ruptured ectopic gestations. The need for partial salpingectomy, frequently utilized under those circumstances, is thus obviated. Salpingostomy may result in spontaneous recanalization; if anastomosis is needed subsequently, maximal tubal length is preserved.\r"

The first three years of the review were prior to the institution of a maternal-fetal medicine intensive care unit, located in the labor-and-delivery suite. The subsequent three years encompassed a period during which an intensive care unit staffed by maternal-fetal medicine specialists and obstetric anesthesiologists was established in the labor-and-delivery suite. The maternal mortality rate was 21.7/100,000, or 10 maternal deaths in 45,984 deliveries, prior to establishment of the unit and 22.1/100,000, or 11 maternal deaths in 49,700 deliveries, after establishment of the unit. The major causes of maternal mortality were pregnancy-induced hypertension, hemorrhage and infection. It appears that a multi-disciplinary team composed of maternal-fetal medicine specialists and obstetric anesthesiologists can provide the same level of care for critically ill obstetric patients that traditionally would be provided by medical intensive care specialists.\r"

The resulting data cover a 21-month period and include all perinatal mortality at two perinatal centers and ten community hospitals. For each case an assessment of potential avoidability was made using the following definition: if any factor was identified that might have altered the outcome, the case was judged potentially avoidable. All other mortality was classified as either unavoidable or undetermined (if sufficient data were not available). During the review period there were a total of 26,937 live births and 591 cases of perinatal mortality. We conclude that: (1) meaningful analysis of factors affecting perinatal mortality data can be obtained by review of all deaths using a standardized classification; (2) in 21% of perinatal mortality at least one potentially avoidable factor could be identified that might have altered the outcome, while 74% was unavoidable and 5% undetermined; and (3) implementation of the review process enabled the reviewers to recognize patterns of potentially avoidable perinatal deaths.\r"

Information on the duration of use during pregnancy was not accurate enough for documentation. In previous pregnancies, only 44.6% of the infants were live born, with spontaneous or therapeutic abortions in 41.1% and stillbirths accounting for 3.6%. In the current pregnancies, 91 patients (66.1%) were nonwhite, and multiple-drug usage was found in 92%, with intravenous cocaine use in 44.6% and freebasing in 31.7% as the main routes of administration. Syphilis or another infection, no prenatal care and poor weight gain (less than or equal to 19 lb) in pregnancy was present in one-third of the patients, while 38% did not know their gestational age. Precipitate labor was found in 63.9% and meconium-stained amniotic fluid in 20.5%. The mean birth weight of the infants was significantly lower than that of the general hospital population; low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) occurred in 36.2%, small size for gestational age in 32.4%, neurologic problems in 30.9% and syphilis in 15.4% of the infants. Congenital abnormalities, in 17.4%, seemed to be multifactorial. The consistent pattern of poor outcome in both the previous and present pregnancies reflects the life-style peculiar to cocaine abusers. Prospective studies are in progress to identify the true incidence of cocaine usage and to outline the counseling of childbearing women against cocaine use during pregnancy, emphasizing prevention since cures are not available.\r"

CMV-seronegative or deglycerolized blood is used routinely in the case of CMV-susceptible neonates and immunocompromised individuals who require a transfusion.

The results indicated that fresh, green, leafy vegetables were moderately high in beta carotene (0.5-14.6 mg/100 g) and very high in oxygenated carotenoids or xanthophylls, primarily lutein and its stereoisomers (2.3-63.0 mg/100g) [corrected]. The fresh, yellow or orange vegetables examined were very high in beta carotene (16.0-120.5 mg/100 g) [corrected] but had no detectable nonhydrocarbon carotenoids. Cooking differentially reduced the lutein content compared with the beta carotene content in green, leafy vegetables. These analyses suggest that consumption of carotenoids in addition to beta carotene may be associated with a lower risk for cancer.\r"

At the baseline examination in 1948, a total of 2,201 women aged 30-62 years were analyzed. An index of central to peripheral body fat (the central adiposity ratio) was calculated from the sum of the trunkal skinfolds (chest, subscapular, and abdominal) divided by the sum of the extremity skinfolds (triceps and thigh). These skinfolds were measured at the fourth examination in 1954. The cohort was followed for up to 28 years and yielded 106 cases of breast cancer. When divided into quartiles based on the central adiposity ratio, only women in the fourth quartile (those with the highest central to peripheral body fat distribution) demonstrated an increased risk for breast cancer. The age- and adiposity-adjusted relative risk estimate for having an increased central adiposity ratio (fourth quartile) compared to lower central adiposity ratios was 1.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.6). Adjustment for potential confounders of height, parity, and education did not appreciably alter this estimate (1.7, 1.1-2.5). There was no association between degree of adiposity, as measured by the sum of the five skinfolds or by body mass index (weight in kg divided by height in m2), and subsequent breast cancer. The results of this study suggest that increased central to peripheral body fat distribution predicts breast cancer risk independently of the degree of adiposity and may be a more specific marker of a premalignant hormonal pattern than degree of adiposity.\r"

Exposure to salted fish was significantly associated with an increased risk of NPC. Four characteristics of exposure to salted fish independently contributed to the increased risk: (a) earlier age at first exposure, (b) increasing duration of consumption, (c) increasing frequency of consumption, and (d) cooking the fish by steaming it rather than frying, grilling, or boiling it. In addition, significant associations were observed for consumption in childhood of salted shrimp paste (increased risk) and carrots (reduced risk), and the three dietary effects (i.e., those from consumption of salted fish, salted shrimp paste, and carrots) were independent of each other. None of the non-dietary factors studied were significantly associated with NPC risk.\r"

  ".W": "Insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) is among the peptide mitogens that play key roles in the regulation of normal skeletal growth. To investigate the possibility that certain skeletal neoplasms retain a sensitivity to mitogenic stimulation by IGF-I, we studied the effects of this growth factor on human osteosarcoma. Competitive-binding assays and affinity-labeling experiments on membranes prepared from MG-63 immortalized human osteosarcoma cells and primary human osteogenic sarcoma cells demonstrate the presence of specific IGF-I receptors. Furthermore, we show that IGF-I is a potent stimulator of proliferation of MG-63 cells in vitro and is active at concentrations as low as 10(-10) M. A blocking antibody against the IGF-I receptor (alpha-IR3) significantly reduces IGF-I-stimulated proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that at least a subset of human osteogenic sarcomas are responsive to IGF-I and indicate that it may be possible to exploit this responsiveness therapeutically.\r"

A significant elevation in ammonium urate supersaturation was found compared to control subjects when studied by the computer model EQUIL 2. Of the patients 7 had 1 or more urine specimens positive for phenolphthalein. Gastrointestinal loss of fluid and electrolytes allowed for chronic extracellular volume depletion. Intracellular acidosis was present as judged by low urinary citrate and potassium. The fact that the ion product for ammonium urate is increased significantly compared to controls reflects the stated pathophysiological changes. Laxative abuse should be suspected whenever a woman has an ammonium urate renal calculus in sterile urine.\r"

No significant changes were noted in urinary saturation of calcium oxalate or brushite or in the limit of metastability (formation product) of these salts. However, when magnesium salts were provided with meals there were more prominent increases in urinary magnesium (by 92 to 96 mg. per day) and in citrate (by 218 to 226 mg. per day). Moreover, urinary oxalate decreased. Owing to these changes the urinary saturation of calcium oxalate decreased and the formation product increased.

Retrospective analysis of the first 512 treatments at a university medical stone unit using the Dornier HM3 lithotriptor was compared to 3 intervals of 100 consecutive treatments during the next 2-year period (1985 to 1987). Patient referral and selection as well as treatment techniques and rates of endourological interventions were analyzed. Patient demographics, stone types and retreatment rates remained constant during 2,500 treatments. However, the use of local anesthesia and internal ureteral stents became increasingly common. Of the 1987 cohort 29% were treated with the patient under local anesthesia, and 23 of the 44 with a stent (52%) received internal ureteral stents. Other treatment trends identified during the study period included increasing number of large (greater than 2 cm.) and multiple stones treated; increasing use of internal and external ureteral catheters before treatment, fewer stents for small, mobile renal calculi and decreasing length of hospital stay (2.7 to 2.1 days) with increasing use of stents before lithotripsy. The increasing average number of shock waves per treatment (1,382 versus 1,580) during the study period can be attributed to the larger proportion of patients with high stone burdens and the impact of an increased number of operators with more varied criteria for endoscopy and treatment end point.\r"

With the stone brush unbypassed stones yielded a success rate similar to that for bypassed stones (84.6 versus 88.9%, respectively).

Stones were impacted in the upper ureter in 10 patients, mid ureter in 11 and lower ureter in 21. Upper ureteral stones were treated in 8 patients by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy after disimpaction by laser or other techniques. Mid ureteral stones were treated by laser alone in 7 patients and by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy after disimpaction in 4. Lower stones were treated by laser in 17 patients and ultrasound in 2. Complications included 3 major and 5 minor perforations, and 4 false passages. Treatment was successful without an open operation in 40 of 42 patients (95%). Our current approach to impacted ureteral calculi involves passing a rigid ureteroscope to the stone, with disimpaction performed by laser fragmentation or other dislodgement maneuvers. Proximal stones or large fragments then are treated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Mid ureteral stones are treated similarly, unless they are so fragile that in situ fragmentation may be completed easily. Lower ureteral stones are fragmented in situ, with hard fragments extracted by basket. Alternative treatments for impacted calculi at all levels include unstented in situ extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, antegrade ureteroscopy and, finally, an operation.\r"

  ".W": "Corpora cavernosa of 5 normal and 11 impotent living men were studied by electron microscopy. Of the smooth muscle cells 42.3% from corporeal tissues of impotent men showed a pronounced thickening of the basal lamina, a paucity of dense bodies and contractile filaments, minimal or no glycogen and fewer vesicles on the cell surface, whereas only 5.4% of the smooth muscle cells from normal men showed similar alterations. These differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.003). The percentage of altered smooth muscle cells in corporeal tissues of impotent men was proportional to the severity of symptoms and clinical findings. Morphometric analysis revealed no significant differences in the relative proportions of the major components of corporeal tissue (smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix, vascular lumina and endothelial cells). These findings suggest the need for early detection of corporeal tissue degeneration by preoperative biopsy to assist in better selection of candidates for a penile vascular operation. They also may contribute to the development of new therapeutic modalities for erectile dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the correlation between erotic and nocturnal erections, and to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the audiovisual stimulation penogram as an initial screening test for impotent patients, a comparative study of 137 impotent patients was designed. The audiovisual stimulation penogram shows dynamic penile blood flow change during audiovisual stimulation using a radioisotope (99mtechnetium) and is classified as type 1--similar findings to normal volunteers, type 2A--impossible erection due to insufficient blood flow, type 2B--unstable erection due to severe fluctuation in blood flow and type 2C--delayed erection. The compatibility ratios of the audiovisual stimulation penogram types 1, 2A and 2C with some tests for nocturnal erection were relatively high (63 to 80%) and when compared to the final diagnosis all but 1 of the compatible cases with nocturnal erection studies were able to be diagnosed correctly. However, the compatibility ratio of the audiovisual stimulation penogram type 2B was markedly low (35%) and this group had complicated etiologies, including many more psychogenic than organic causes. Although the mechanisms of the erotic and nocturnal erections have not been fully elucidated to date, our results suggest that the audiovisual stimulation penogram seems to be an appropriate initial screening step if we refine the criteria for type 2B, and a comprehensive interpretation of the tests for erotic and nocturnal erections will result in a more accurate diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Artificial insemination with donor semen has become a well established alternative for couples with untreatable male factor infertility. Because of the widespread use of donor insemination, and the increasing awareness and prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases, the American Fertility Society recently redrafted procedural guidelines for the use of donor screening for insemination. Our series of donor screenings is reported to emphasize the necessity of donor evaluations at frequent intervals. From June 1986 through August 1987, 48 healthy male volunteers presented as potential semen donors for our donor program. Each was evaluated with a careful medical history, physical examination and 2 semen analyses for evidence of sexually transmitted disease. On initial evaluation, no donor presented with a positive human immunodeficiency virus antibody, abnormal karyotype, elevated serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, rapid plasma reagent, or positive cultures for Chlamydia or Mycoplasma. One potential donor was excluded because of a positive hepatitis B-core antibody and 1 because of a positive IgM test for cytomegalovirus. At initial examination 3 potential donors had a positive culture for Ureaplasma; all 3 were treated with 3 weeks of tetracycline, and repeat cultures were all negative. Routine followup screening was performed on all donors at 3-month intervals for all sexually transmitted diseases. During this 14-month period cultures converted to positive for Ureaplasma in 4 donors. Furthermore, 1 donor at 6 months contracted gonorrhea. He was treated but no longer used as a donor. Since initiation of the outlined protocol more than 800 inseminations have been performed using fresh semen with no case of sexually transmitted diseases reported from our recipients. We conclude that careful sexual history, and frequent donor and semen evaluation are necessary for prevention of diseases that might be transmitted sexually. If these precautions are strictly observed use of donor semen is safe and effective.\r"

Quantitative analysis of the seminiferous tubular and epithelial parameters demonstrated a statistically significant increase in tubular wall thickness in the vasectomized group. There was no significant difference among the groups with reference to the mean number of late spermatids per seminiferous tubules, mean number of Sertoli cells per seminiferous tubules, mean number of seminiferous tubules per field (100 times) or mean seminiferous tubular diameter. We conclude that despite a lifelong duration of obstruction, men with vasal agenesis demonstrate a more favorable testicular histological status compared to men after vasectomy. This finding may have therapeutic implications when considering assisted pregnancy techniques as a method of treatment of male genital tract atresia.\r"

Nine healthy men 20 to 62 years old were evaluated as controls. The patients had no symptoms from the lower urinary tract except for 2 men with slight prostatism. The maximum intravesical and maximum voiding pressures were elevated significantly in the patients compared to the controls (p less than 0.05). In most patients and in all of the controls the maximum urinary flow rates were within the normal range according to age. Because of the frequency of high voiding pressures in patients with previous acute epididymitis, this condition may be a pathogenic factor by promoting urethrovasal reflux. The high voiding pressures may be transmitted to the proximal urethra or in cases of a narrow and rigid bladder neck they may produce increased turbulence in the urine stream.\r"

We used dependence upon dialysis as the parameter for early graft function. There was a statistically significant difference in long-term graft survival between patients who were independent of and dependent on dialysis at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively. Our results show that early renal graft function is important for long-term graft survival. All efforts should be directed to obtaining early renal graft function by proper organ procurement, storage, operative technique and aggressive postoperative management.\r"

For many years discussions have centered around the ideal age to operate on patients with undescended testes and consequently increase chances for future fertility. We analyzed 66 patients (82 testes) treated for undescended testis in our department, with special distinction between ectopia and cryptorchidism. Abnormalities ranged from simple epididymal elongation to more complex forms, such as complete disruption between the testis and epididymis. Among 49 ectopic testes the epididymides of 19 (38.8%) displayed more severe abnormalities in addition to elongation, while 16 (32.6%) showed only an elongated epididymis and 14 (28.6%) were normal. Among the 33 cryptorchid testes 29 (87.9%) showed the more complex anomalies and elongation, 3 (9.1%) were normal and only 1 (3%) was elongated. Our results demonstrate a much higher incidence of complex epididymal abnormalities in cryptorchidism (p less than 0.001). Elongated epididymis may present problems for sperm maturation and transportation, although with no other associated abnormality most can be regarded as patent. In our theory cases of elongation plus other major abnormalities probably are associated with severe impairment in sperm maturation and hindered transportation, with the future intrascrotal or extrascrotal position of the testis or early surgical repair being of little importance in terms of fertility.\r"

In the colonic mucosa from the reservoir there was shortening of microvilli, in some cases with random orientation and numerical reduction-changes unrelated to the time from reservoir construction. Filamentous core rootlets were also randomly oriented and numerically diminished. Glycocalyceal bodies were present in most cases. Mucosal edema and reduced numbers of goblet cells were found in six cases and increased amount of collagen in two. In the ileal nipple valve mucosa there were no microvillous changes, but metaplastic formation of glycocalyceal bodies was interpreted as adaptation to physiologic conditions comparable with those in the reservoir's colonic mucosa. Collagen increase was found in two of the nipple valves. Neurogenic processes, enterochromaffin cells and Paneth cells were always well preserved in normal amounts in the cecal as well as the ileal mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "A juvenile animal model has been developed to study the growth potential of ileum in the urinary tract. Patch ileocystoplasties of known surface area were constructed in dogs of Group 1. Nonrefluxing ileal nipple valves of known length were created to replace one ureter in dogs of Group 2. After the juvenile animals grew and at minimum doubled their weight, they were reoperated and augmentation surface areas were remeasured at various physiologic intravesical pressures. Nipple valve lengths were remeasured after cystograms ruled out reflux. Results show that the bowel augmentation and an identical control segment increased in surface area proportionate to animal growth and that hydrostatic dilation caused further surface area increase. Nipple valves did not grow and in fact shortened, but remained nonrefluxing. The conclusion is that in the pediatric population, consideration should be given to downscaling the size of bladder augmentations or diversions in anticipation of future bowel growth, but that one should not shorten the ileal nipple valves.\r"

Established human prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and DU-145) as well as biologically aggressive variants (PC-3 ASC and PC-3 DES) were shown to possess significant levels of high affinity TfR when assessed in vitro. In contrast, TfR content was negligible in cultured stromal cell fractions derived from human benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) specimens. Scatchard analysis was also performed on in vivo derived prostatic tissues: tumors resulting from the subcutaneous xenografting of PC-3 ASC cells into athymic, nude mice and fresh BPH surgical specimens. These tissues were dissociated and their stromal and epithelial components separated. TfR were only detected in the epithelial component of both malignant and benign epithelial cells. PC-3 ASC tumor cells exhibited TfR levels comparable to their in vitro expression and these levels were 10-fold greater than in the BPH cells. These findings suggest that elevated TfRs may serve as another useful marker of the transformed phenotype within human prostate tumor systems.\r"

Of major importance in this form of treatment is the extent to which light penetrates the target organ; hence, our interest in the optical properties of the human prostate gland. We obtained three whole prostates from autopsies of patients who died of non-urological causes. Red light was launched interstitially and detector fibres measured light intensity as a function of distance from the delivery fibre end. The optical constants derived from the three prostates were almost identical and indicated that light was predominantly scattered rather than absorbed (mean absorption and scattering coefficients 0.07 +/- 0.02 mm.-1 and 0.86 +/- 0.05 mm.-1 respectively). In a comparison of the tissue penetration by four different wavelengths, 633 nm red light was found to be transmitted best. Light propagation in the heavily absorbing tissue of the human liver was 4.3 times poorer than in the prostate. Such a combination of low absorption and high scattering characteristics in prostatic tissue would enhance the effectiveness of PDT. The optical constants derived will enable \"light treatment planning\" in patients with prostatic cancer.\r"

We explored the possibility that a component of urine may suppress antral gastrin activity in the dog. Partial cystectomy and antral transposition to the bladder (ATB) was performed in five animals and antral transposition to the colon (ATC) was performed in five other dogs to serve as a hypergastrinemic controls. At four and eight weeks after surgery the mean serum gastrin levels in the ATC dogs were significantly greater than the mean preoperative levels (p less than 0.05). In contrast, at four and eight weeks after surgery the mean serum gastrin levels in the ATB animals were significantly less than the mean preoperative levels (p less than 0.05). The antral G-cell density as determined by immunohistochemical study at eight weeks after surgery was greater than normal in the ATC dogs but less than normal in the ATB dogs; but the differences did not achieve statistical significance. In another series of experiments using four other dogs a 4% aqueous peptone solution and a 4% peptone solution in concentrated dog urine were instilled into exteriorized antral pouches. The mean serum gastrin levels at 60 and 90 minutes after instillation of the former were significantly increased (p less than 0.05), but there was little or no change after instillation of the latter. Urine, or a component of urine, appears to suppress canine antral gastrin secretion and may explain the absence of hypergastrinemia following gastrocystoplasty in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Regression of the rat ventral prostate gland following castration is accompanied by the induced expression of messenger RNA encoding Testosterone Repressed Prostate Message-2 (TRPM-2). Subsequent studies have shown that this gene is also induced during renal injury. In each of these tissues, the TRPM-2 RNA products are expressed by cells undergoing programmed death as a result of the hormonal stimuli or the traumatic insult. In an attempt to characterize this gene and its products, we partially sequenced complementary DNAs for TRPM-2 isolated from a recombinant library constructed using RNA of a hydronephrotic kidney. The sequence of these clones showed close homology with the sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2/clusterin) gene, expressed constitutively by mammalian Sertoli cells. Antibody recognition studies confirm this homology. Antiserum made against rat clusterin recognized TRPM-2 encoded polypeptides in extracts of regressing rat ventral prostate glands. Western blot analysis allowed us to demonstrate large increases in the concentration of these proteins in extracts of regressing ventral prostate gland and in rat serum and urine during the acute period of prostatic regression. These results indicate that proteins are synthesized from the large amount of TRPM-2 RNA produced by dying prostate cells and imply that these proteins are shed into the serum and urine. Based on the intense synthesis of TRPM-2 gene products by dying cells in the urogenital tract and the ability to assay for these products in serum and urine, we suggest that an assay for TRPM-2 products might allow us to monitor the extent of cellular damage associated with specific urogenital disease states.\r"

  ".U": "90134125\r", 
  ".W": "From January 1980 through December 1988, 564 limbs in 434 patients were treated for infrainguinal arterial ischemia. Of these, 516 limbs in 387 patients underwent reversed vein bypass grafting. The remainder were treated by primary amputation (11 limbs, 1.9%) or by prosthetic bypass (37 limbs, 6.4%). The indications for operation were limb salvage in 80% of limbs and claudication in 20%. Adequate ipsilateral greater saphenous vein was available for 285 (55%) grafts, with reversed vein bypass achieved in the other 231 operations by use of distal graft origins (151 grafts), use of alternate vein sources (120 grafts), and splicing of venous segments (81 grafts). Seventy-six grafts (15%) were to the above-knee popliteal artery, 199 grafts (37%) were to the below-knee popliteal artery, and 241 grafts (47%) were to infrapopliteal arteries, 26 of which (11%) were to inframalleolar arteries. The primary and secondary patencies for all grafts at 5 years were 75% and 81%, respectively. Grafts to infrapopliteal arteries had significantly worse primary patency (69%) at 5 years than did grafts to the popliteal artery (77%, above knee; 80%, below knee) and grafts formed of adequate ipsilateral greater saphenous vein had significantly better primary patency (80%) than did grafts performed when this conduit was not available (68%). Secondary patency of all graft categories ranged from 76% to 85%, and there were no significant differences regardless of site of distal anastomosis, source of venous conduit, or site of graft origins. We prefer the use of reversed vein bypass grafting for lower extremity revascularization both because of the excellent patency results and because the technique can be applied to the larger number of patients in our practice who lack intact ipsilateral greater saphenous vein, in contrast to in situ vein bypass procedures.\r"

To investigate this question, we studied 52 patients surviving 1 year or more after surgical interruption of the infrarenal aorta in the course of treatment of aortic graft infection. Blood pressure, renal function, and renal artery anatomy were studied before and after aortic interruption. Preoperatively, 20 patients (38.4%) had treated hypertension, and 11 (21.2%) had impaired renal function (creatinine greater than 1.3 mg/dl). In 46 patients (88.4%) with angiography before aortic interruption, 31 (67.4%) had normal renal arteries, whereas 15 (32.6%) demonstrated renal artery stenosis of less than or equal to 50% (N = 10) or greater than 50% (N = 9). Concomitant renal revascularization (N = 3) or nephrectomy (N = 1) were rare. All patients were monitored after surgery for a mean period of 39.2 months. Thirty-three (63.5%) remain alive and well; 19 (36.5%) have died of causes not related (N = 15) or indirectly related (N = 4) to the original graft infection. Forty-eight patients (92.3%) had late assessment of their blood pressure (N = 44, mean follow-up of 31.0 months) and/or renal function (creatinine) (N = 42, mean follow-up of 26.1 months). Follow-up aortography in 21 patients (40.4%, mean interval of 27.7 months) demonstrated no instance of suprarenal propagation of aortic thrombus. During follow-up 41 patients (78.8%) had no change in either their blood pressure or serum creatinine. Seven patients (13.5%) developed worsening hypertension (N = 3) or a rising creatinine (N = 4).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Overt coronary disease was associated with diminished 30-day (p = 0.03) and late (p less than 0.0001) survival. Risk factors in the absence of overt disease were not associated with diminished 30-day survival. Late survival up to 3 years from endarterectomy was similar in groups IIA and IIB, but later survival was diminished in group IIA. Myocardial infarction was the most frequent cause of death in all groups. Patients with overt coronary disease are at high risk for late cardiac events and death. Patients without overt disease are at less risk than those with overt disease, and in the absence of overt disease, those without are at less risk than those with risk factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since reperfusion injury reflects the metabolic state of an organ as well as the duration and severity of ischemia, we investigated the effect of glucagon in a standard model of intestinal ischemia. Data were generated from denervated isoperfused rat small intestinal preparations (n = 39). Arterial and venous pressures, intestinal blood flow, and oxygen consumption were monitored. Animals were subjected to 15, 30, or 45 minutes of ischemia followed by 1 hour reperfusion. Experiments were performed without drug infusion or during intravenous glucagon administration (0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 micrograms/kg/min). After the rats were killed, histologic sections of intestine were graded 1 through 5 in a blinded fashion with 1 = normal villi and 5 = severe injury. Results (mean +/- SD) were analyzed by analysis of variance (*p less than 0.05). Glucagon at all concentrations increased intestinal blood flow and oxygen consumption before ischemia. For example, with 0.2 micrograms/kg/min glucagon, intestinal blood flow increased from 80.78 +/- 13.5 to 114.79 +/- 21.02 ml/min.100 gm* and oxygen consumption increased from 3.65 +/- 0.73 to 5.73 +/- 1.37 ml/min.100 gm.* Mucosal injury after ischemia reflected duration of ischemia and glucagon infusion rate. At all ischemic intervals, increased glucagon concentrations were associated with greater mucosal injury. In fact the histologic injury with 15 minutes of ischemia + 0.2 microgram/kg/min glucagon (3.04 +/- 0.49) exceeded that of 30 minutes of ischemia (2.87 +/- 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After balloon-catheter thromboembolectomy residual, occlusive thrombi tightly adherent to the arterial wall were removed with flexible biopsy forceps in 13 of 73 (18%) patients; underlying intimal flaps were removed in another four. In nine patients traumatic intimal defects caused by iatrogenic cannulation injuries (n = 5) or external trauma (n = 4) were managed by thrombectomy followed by complete or partial intravascular removal of the intimal flap (n = 6) or dissection plane (n = 3) with long flexible forceps and rotating brushes. Traumatic intimal defects observed in two additional patients were judged to be too severe for endoscopic manipulation and required immediate bypass grafting. Inspection after angioplasty in 32 patients revealed wall charring and obvious thermal damage after laser procedures in 28 (87%) and plaque cracking, intimal flaps, and fragmentation in 26 (81%). These defects were underestimated on intraoperative angiography. Large flaps and thrombus were removed endoscopically in three. We conclude that angioscopic study reveals the extent of intimal injury and gives insights into mechanisms of instrumentation. Adherent thrombus after embolectomy by balloon catheter and intimal flaps caused by trauma or angioplasty are common and, if severe, can be successfully treated by endoscopic intravascular manipulation in selected patients.\r"

Thrombolysis of occluded vein grafts has shown promising short-term results in restoring vein graft patency, however, the long-term results are not established. This study examines the long-term patency and limb salvage after successful thrombolysis and revision of 22 thrombosed vein grafts in 21 patients. There were 17 men and four women with an average age of 60 years (38 to 77 years). Failed vein grafts had an average primary patency of 19 months (1 to 84 months) and included eight in situ grafts and 14 non-in situ grafts. Twelve grafts were to the popliteal level, whereas 10 were infrapopliteal. Thrombolytic agents used included urokinase (15), tissue plasminogen activator (5), and streptokinase (2). After successful thrombolysis, 19 grafts underwent 26 additional procedures including percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (9), vein patch angioplasty (4), vein interposition or jump extension graft (9), or other procedures (4). Three patients had no additional procedure, but one was placed on sodium warfarin (Coumadin). After successful initial vein graft salvage, life-table analysis revealed a 36.6% +/- 11.9% patency at 1 year and a 22.9% +/- 11.6% patency at 3 years. After secondary failure six patients had further interventions contributing to an improved limb salvage of 66.9% +/- 11.6% at 1 year and 60.3% +/- 19.0% at 3 years. The results suggest that thrombosed vein grafts initially salvaged with thrombolysis and revision do not have a favorable long-term patency, and that a premium must be placed on the detection of the failing vein graft before thrombosis.\r"

To further delineate its role in vascular healing, we have studied the effects of thrombin on proliferation and matrix production by the cells of the vessel wall. The addition of thrombin (1 unit/ml) to cultures of bovine aortic smooth muscle cells resulted in an increase in cell proliferation (p less than 0.01) and number (p less than 0.03), whereas in cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells thrombin produced a decrease in cell proliferation (p less than 0.01) and number (p less than 0.02). Thrombin also altered matrix composition in cultures of these cells. In both bovine aortic endothelial cells and bovine aortic smooth muscle cell cultures grown in the presence of thrombin, total protein content was significantly increased when compared to controls (p less than 0.03). In bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures the addition of thrombin resulted in a decrease in collagen content (p less than 0.01) and an increase in sulfated glycosaminoglycan content (p less than 0.02). In contrast, in bovine aortic smooth muscle cell cultures thrombin resulted in an increase in collagen content (p less than 0.03), whereas glycosaminoglycan content was unaffected. These findings suggest that thrombin may significantly influence vascular healing and function by altering cell number and matrix composition.\r"

In recent years we have preferentially used the extended retroperitoneal approach for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms to derive similar physiologic benefits for these patients. Over a 6-year period (1983 to 1989) 76 cases of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated by emergency aortic replacement. After exclusion of 13 patients whose aneurysmal ruptures were unusual, such as aortoenteric fistula, aortocaval fistula, chronic contained rupture, or visceral involvement, 63 patients were retrospectively studied. Thirty-eight patients were treated via a standard transperitoneal celiotomy and 25 via a left retroperitoneal incision. No significant differences were found between the two groups in regard to cardiac or pulmonary function or duration of preoperative hypotension. Operative mortality was lower in the retroperitoneal group (three of 25, 12%) as compared to the transperitoneal group (13 of 38, 34.2%). Furthermore, the retroperitoneal group required less ventilatory support and tolerated enteral feedings quickly. Length of stay in the hospital was also significantly reduced in the retroperitoneal group. These data indicate that many ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms can be successfully treated through the left retroperitoneal approach. In this nonrandomized clinical series increased survival rates and shorter periods of postoperative recovery were noted in the patients operated with the retroperitoneal approach.\r"

  ".W": "The inexperience of house staff has been offered as one explanation for the increased cost of care at teaching hospitals, but conclusive evidence for this has been lacking. We studied the relationship of house staff experience to the cost and quality of inpatient care in a large series of internal medicine patients at one teaching hospital. We defined house staff experience by the month of academic year during which the patient received care. Our measures of cost were length of hospital stay and total hospital charges, while our measures of quality were hospital deaths, hospital readmissions, and nursing home placement. Multiple linear regression analysis on 21,679 hospital discharges revealed increasing house staff experience to be associated with a significant decline in length of stay (95% confidence interval for b, -0.006 to -0.066 days per discharge per month of house staff experience) and total hospital charges (95% confidence interval for b, -0.002 to -0.017 log dollars per discharge per month of house staff experience). These findings constitute an estimated average decline of 0.43 days per discharge and +370 per discharge over the academic year. Logistic regression analysis found no relationship of house staff experience to hospital deaths, readmissions, or nursing home placement. These findings suggest that the process of training inexperienced physicians may represent an important source of inefficiency for teaching hospitals struggling in a competitive environment.\r"

House officer responses to an alcohol-impaired physician differed depending on whether that physician was an attending physician or a house officer. Seventy-two percent of house officers would tell the chief resident about the alcohol-impaired attending physician, whereas 96% would confront the alcohol-impaired house officer personally. The most common response to the incompetent attending physician (67%) and the incompetent house officer (49%) was to tell the chief resident; only 25% would confront an incompetent house officer. In contrast, 71% would confront a depressed house officer.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 35,000 Staphylococcus aureus surgical wound infections occur annually in the United States. To investigate why S aureus causes infection despite the perioperative administration of cephalosporins, we compared 35 methicillin-susceptible isolates recovered from deep wound infections that complicated cefazolin prophylaxis (18 of 1650 patients) and cefamandole prophylaxis (17 of 3702 patients) with 64 colonizing isolates from presurgical patients. Compared with both colonizing and cefamandole-associated isolates, S aureus isolates from cefazolin-associated infections were more resistant to cefazolin by specialized assays. Staphylococcus aureus isolates that produced the A and C variants of staphylococcal beta-lactamase were associated with infections following cefazolin and cefamandole prophylaxis, respectively. These isolates hydrolyze the respective cephalosporins rapidly, suggesting that staphylococcal survival after perioperative prophylaxis may be mediated by in vivo degradation of the prophylactically administered cephalosporin. These data indicate that some S aureus wound infections occur because of deficiencies in antimicrobial effectiveness that are not detectable by routine susceptibility tests. This finding has important implications for the therapy and prevention of S aureus infection.\r"

Plasma vasopressin levels were elevated in 15 patients, with the highest levels seen in patients who died (median, 7.08 pmol/L). Hyponatremia of multiple etiologies occurred in a majority of inpatients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, often following the administration of hypotonic fluids, and was associated with a 30% (8/27) short-term mortality.\r"

During a 3-year period, only 1 of 191 positive stool cultures and none of the 90 ova and parasite examinations with positive results were from the group of patients who had stool specimens submitted after 3 days of hospitalization. Analysis of laboratory work load for a 1-year period showed that specimens from this patient group contributed nearly 50% of the more than 3000 specimens received each year. In contrast, approximately 25% (range, 17% to 33%) of samples, regardless of admission status, were positive for C difficile toxin. Eliminating routine stool cultures and ova and parasite examinations on hospitalized patients would significantly reduce hospital and patient costs without altering patient care. Nationwide, such a policy might achieve a cost savings of +20 to +30 million per year.\r"

A combination of the two modalities makes the diagnosis in greater than 90% of cases. Magnetic resonance imaging is also sensitive and specific. Angiography, as shown in these cases, may not only be questionably indicated, but may be misleading. The treatment for symptomatic lesions is resection, and secondary alternatives are discussed.\r"

Women who had a myocardial infarction were older and more often had hypertension, diabetes, previous heart failure, and impaired left ventricular function on admission. Cumulative 3-year mortality and in-hospital mortality rates were significantly higher in women than men, but mortality among hospital survivors was similar. After multivariate adjustment for baseline differences, mortality rates were not significantly different between women and men for in-hospital deaths, and mortality at 3 years among hospital survivors tended to be lower among women. We conclude that higher observed mortality rates following a myocardial infarction in women are related to differences in known risk factors for subsequent mortality and that gender should not be considered an independent risk factor for mortality after myocardial infarction.\r"

Fifty patients (22%) met criteria for delirium; nondelirious elderly constituted the control group. Abnormal sodium levels, illness severity, dementia, fever or hypothermia, psychoactive drug use, and azotemia were associated with risk of delirium. Patients with three or more risk factors had a 60% rate of delirium. Delirious patients stayed 12.1 days in the hospital vs 7.2 days for controls and were more likely to die (8% vs 1%) or be institutionalized (16% vs 3%). Illness severity predicted 6-month mortality, but the effect of delirium was not significant. Delirium occurs commonly in hospitalized elderly, is associated with chronic and acute problems, and identifies elderly at risk for death, longer hospitalization, and institutionalization. The increased mortality associated with delirium appears to be explained by greater severity of illness.\r"

  ".W": "Since protein malnourished or endotoxemic patients are at increased risk of developing nosocomial infections with enteric organisms, we investigated the effects of these risk factors alone and in combination on the intestinal mucosal barrier to bacteria. Protein malnutrition resulted in severe ileal atrophy that was directly related to the length of time the mice were protein malnourished. Although protein malnutrition did not promote bacterial translocation from the gut to systemic organs, the protein-malnourished mice were more susceptible to endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation than normally nourished mice (p less than 0.01). Since the gross epithelial damage documented after endotoxin administration in normally nourished mice was diminished after protein malnutrition, there was no correlation between the gross appearance of the epithelial mucosal barrier and the extent of endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation. These results suggest that the synergistic effect of endotoxin plus protein malnutrition on bacterial translocation is not primarily related to failure of the gut mucosal barrier. Nonetheless, it appears that protein-malnourished mice are less able to clear translocating bacteria than normally nourished mice.\r"

  ".W": "Animal data and anecdotal human experience suggest that vascular damage induced by the infusion of dextrose/amino acid solutions may be ameliorated by the concomitant administration of fat emulsion. We prospectively evaluated the effect of the continuous infusion of peripheral nutrition solutions with and without fat emulsion on the incidence of, probability of, and time to infiltration of peripheral venous lines in infants (median age: 1.0 month; range 1 day-11.9 months). Ninety-seven peripheral venous lines were studied in 53 infants who received 10% dextrose (n = 34), 10% dextrose/2% amino acids (n = 30), or 10% dextrose/2% amino acids/fat emulsion (n = 33). Solutions were administered by positive pressure infusion devices through Teflon catheters with similar gauge. Dextrose, amino acid, electrolyte, and mineral content was standardized for the dextrose/amino acid and dextrose/amino acid/fat emulsion groups. The three groups were similar with respect to age, race, gender, weight, administration of intravenous medications, and catheter site (p greater than 0.05). Patients receiving dextrose/amino acid or dextrose/amino acid/fat emulsion had greater rates of solution administration than those receiving dextrose alone (p less than 0.002). Infiltration occurred in 71% of dextrose, 66% of dextrose/amino acid, and 67% of dextrose/amino acid/fat emulsion solutions (p greater than 0.05). The probability of infiltration was greater for infants receiving dextrose/amino acid than for those receiving either dextrose or dextrose/amino acid/fat emulsion (p = 0.01). The mean +/- SEM length of time the intravenous sites were viable was significantly shorter for the dextrose/amino acid solutions (26.3 +/- 3.3 hr) compared to the dextrose (54.9 +/- 7.8 hr) and dextrose/amino acid/fat emulsion (43.6 +/- 4.2 hr) groups. No site complications were associated with the infiltration of any solution. We conclude that the incidence of infiltration among the three solution groups studied is not different. However, the time to infiltration is prolonged and the probability of infiltration is decreased following the infusion of either dextrose alone or dextrose/amino acid/fat emulsion solutions when compared to the administration of dextrose/amino acid solutions without concomitant fat emulsion infusion.\r"

Paired comparisons of osmolarities within isocaloric (60 or 80 kcal/kg/day) infusions showed that high fat regimens were associated with significantly lower osmolarities. A paired comparison of patency times showed that the drop in osmolarity produced by the high fat regimen at 60 kcal/kg/day led to a significantly longer venous patency time. The comparison of patency times between regimens (LF, 60 kcal/kg/day) and HF, 80 kcal/kg/day) with same osmolarities (702 mOsm/liter) and glucose intakes (11 g/kg/day) documented that the fat emulsion per se had a vascular protective effect. This observation demonstrates that the coinfusion of a lipid emulsion exerts a beneficial effect, whether biochemical or biophysical, on the vascular endothelium of peripheral veins.\r"

Recently a clinically and pathologically similar cardiomyopathy has been described in AIDS. Since blood selenium levels are low in AIDS, we assayed cardiac selenium status by a spectrofluorometric method in eight AIDS patients at autopsy compared to nine age-matched, non-AIDS autopsy controls with histologically normal hearts. We found (mean +/- SD) a cardiac selenium level of 0.327 +/- 0.082 microgram/g dry weight in AIDS vs 0.534 +/- 0.184 microgram/g dry weight in controls (p less than 0.01; Student's t test). There were no significant differences between the groups for heart weight, serum CPK, or other laboratory parameters. No specific chest x-ray or electrocardiographic abnormalities were present. Histologically, all AIDS hearts were abnormal; mostly with mild degrees of muscle hypertrophy or fibrosis. Foci of myocytolysis and myocyte necrosis and fibrous replacement of myocytes and monocytic infiltration were present in two AIDS cases. We conclude that heart tissue in AIDS demonstrates a significant selenium deficit. These data provide a potential link between selenium deficiency and cardiomyopathy in AIDS.\r"

Protrusion of the tip into the lumen of the iliac vein is avoided. The technique was successful in four of the five patients where an attempt was made to insert the catheter. In the fifth case the vein was too narrow to allow catheterization. In the four cases where the catheter was successfully inserted there were no complications. This technique may allow use of the inferior vena cava for venous access without the high risk of intravenous thrombosis which is inherent with current methods.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the possibility that tubule fluid iron could be involved in the pathogenesis of the tubulo-interstitial injury associated with primary glomerular disease. Tubule fluid iron is determined by the magnitude of the glomerular leak for transferrin and the iron saturation of transferrin. To minimize tubule fluid iron in an experimental model of glomerulonephritis, iron deficiency was induced in rats prior to the induction of nephrotoxic serum nephritis. Iron deficiency did not effect the development of glomerular disease as determined by proteinuria, but had a marked effect on preventing the development of tubulo-interstitial disease and renal functional deterioration. There was also a strong correlation between the amount of functional deterioration and extent of tubulo-interstitial disease and urinary iron excretion in both the control and iron deficient animals. It is proposed that injury results from iron being dissociated from transferrin at the more acid pH of the tubule fluid. Iron, a transition element, is able to catalyze the Haber-Weiss reaction with the formation of free hydroxyl radicals which causes renal tubule cell injury. This tubulo-interstitial injury is the major determinate of progressive renal functional deterioration in this experimental model of glomerulonephritis.\r"

A physiological concentration of glucagon (10(-8), (10(-10) M) also increased chloride efflux significantly. Pretreatment of tubules with luminal furosemide (10(-5) M) and/or basolateral ouabain (10(-4) M) completely abolished the effect of glucagon. In isolated MTALs incubated in the same medium as that used in the microperfusion study, 10(-6) M glucagon stimulated cAMP production by 255.2 +/- 33.7% (P less than 0.01). However, neither dibutyryl cAMP (10(-3), 10(-4) M) nor forskolin (10(-4), 10(-6) M) increased the chloride efflux. It is concluded that: 1) Glucagon stimulates net Cl reabsorption by increasing Cl efflux in the rat MTAL; and 2) cyclic AMP is not responsible for this effect of glucagon.\r"

Platelet accumulation was biphasic with a major peak at 10 minutes and a minor peak at four hours. Early platelet accumulation was complement dependent, and PMN-independent. PMN accumulation occurred after the initial platelet influx, peaking at one and four hours, was complement dependent, but was not affected by platelet depletion. Complement depletion significantly reduced proteinuria. This is the first documentation that platelet accumulation in glomeruli in IC GN is complement dependent. In addition, the enhancement of PMN-mediated injury by the platelet in this model does not involve effects of platelets on PMN localization, thus implying a functional interaction between these cells within the glomerulus.\r"

Although parathyroid hormone (PTH) is important in the adaptations to phosphate, the mechanisms are not completely defined. In the present studies we examined the response of the adenylate cyclase system to PTH in renal cortical membranes of rat kidneys ten days after unilateral nephrectomy. The kidneys obtained at the time of the initial nephrectomy were used as controls. Unilateral nephrectomy resulted in contralateral compensatory renal growth, as demonstrated by a 24 +/- 4.7% (P less than 0.01) increase in weight in the remaining kidney. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after unilateral nephrectomy was 62% of the control, while basal fractional phosphate excretion was higher in rats with unilateral nephrectomy (7.7 +/- 2.1% vs. 2.9 +/- 0.8%, P less than 0.05). PTH infusion resulted in a similar increase of fractional phosphate excretion and urinary cAMP in both groups. In the absence of added guanine nucleotides, PTH-dependent adenylate cyclase activity in cortical membranes from kidneys with compensatory growth was decreased as compared to controls (Vmax 807.5 +/- 62.7 pmol cAMP/mg protein/30 min vs. 1,384.8 +/- 116.1, respectively, P less than 0.01). The apparent affinity for PTH stimulation of adenylate cyclase (Kact) was unchanged. Magnesium-dependent adenylate cyclase activity was also decreased in the membranes from kidneys with compensatory growth. However, the kinetics of adenylate cyclase for the substrates ATP-Mg or ATP-Mn were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Northern analysis of polyadenylated RNAs of kidney cortical tissue showed diminished renal preproEGF mRNA in rats injected with cisplatin (5 mg/kg). The decrease in preproEGF mRNA occurred as early as 12 hours in the kidney and persisted for at least three days after cisplatin injection. The submandibular gland, a major site of EGF synthesis, contained normal levels of preproEGF mRNA. Transplatin, a non-nephrotoxic isomer of cisplatin, did not reduce renal preproEGF mRNA levels. Northern analysis of polyadenylated RNAs of kidney cortical tissue 24 hours after a 50 minute period of renal pedicle clamping also showed reduced preproEGF mRNA levels. By contrast, cisplatin increased renal c-fos mRNA. Urinary EGF excretion was also reduced after cisplatin and ischemia and the decrease in EGF excretion correlated significantly with the degree of renal failure. The data show that nephrotoxic and ischemic renal cell injury reduces preproEGF mRNA and urinary EGF excretion. Reduced preproEGF mRNA and diminished EGF excretion may be important in the functional and regenerative responses to renal injury.\r"

  ".W": "Thick ascending limb of Henle (TAL) necrosis in the isolated perfused kidney is an important model of renal hypoxia, but physiologic and metabolic correlation with this morphologic damage has been inadequate. More precise estimation of TAL adenine nucleotides in this model was obtained in the present study by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of biopsy samples from the inner stripe of the outer medulla during perfusion. The inner stripe, which is the zone where TAL are concentrated, showed ATP depletion and low adenylate energy charge (AEC) early in perfusion prior to the appearance of TAL necrosis. Free water clearance (CH2O) was used as an estimate of TAL transport activity; the CH2O observed during 90 minute perfusions was found to be predictive of the extent of TAL necrosis in each experiment. The results support the idea that there is significant medullary hypoxia in the isolated perfused kidney and that TAL solute transport is a determinant of injury in this model. In further studies, the effects of ouabain (10(-3) M), furosemide (10(-4) M) or acidosis (pH 7.0 rather than the usual pH 7.4) on TAL transport activity and adenine nucleotide levels were compared. All three maneuvers have been shown previously to reduce TAL injury in the isolated perfused kidney. Addition of ouabain or furosemide reduced CH2O and TAL necrosis in parallel while acidosis had no effect on CH2O during perfusion. Both ouabain and furosemide attenuated ATP depletion and resulted in higher AEC while acidosis had no effect on these indices of cellular hypoxia. Therefore, the mechanism of cytoprotection by acidosis appears distinct from that of ouabain or furosemide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the absence of ADH. IMCD cells behaved in an osmometric fashion over the range of extracellular osmolalities 290 to 386 mOsm/kg H2O and had an osmotic space equal to 54.2% of total geometric volume. After initial shrinkage in hypertonic perfusing and bathing solutions (340 mOsm/kg H2O using sucrose), cell volume increased rapidly to the isotonic value only in tubules preincubated in ADH (100 microU/ml). The rates of VIR were: (-ADH) 0.0142 +/- 0.0046 nl.min-1.cm-1 or 0.30 +/- 0.10%/min and (+ADH) 0.7225 +/- 0.1278 nl.min-1.cm-1 or 15.42 +/- 2.31%/min (N = 4; P less than 0.01). An overshoot in cell volume was observed on return to isotonic media only in the ADH exposed tubules showing a hypertonic VRI response, indicating that IMCD cells accumulated solute during hypertonic VRI. In the absence of ADH, one mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP mimicked the effect of hormone on hypertonic VRI. This ADH-dependent VRI process required Na+ and (CO2 + HCO3-) in external media and was reduced or abolished by 0.1 mM amiloride, 0.1 mM 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) in peritubular solutions. These data suggest that ADH-dependent, rapid hypertonic cell volume regulation in rat inner medullary collecting duct depends on NA+ uptake, which may be mediated by parallel Na+-H+ and an HCO3(-)-dependent. DIDS-sensitive pathway (such as, Cl+-HCO3- exchanger) in basolateral cell membrane. In addition, a luminal amiloride-sensitive pathway (most likely the cation-selective channel) may contribute to cell volume regulation in the rat IMCD.\r"

In addition, hematologic data were evaluated in 19 of these patients during and after treatment with DFO. Although neither severe anemia nor microcytosis was observed pretreatment, there was a significant correlation between hemoglobin level and degree of aluminum burden as determined by bone surface aluminum staining (r = -0.58; P less than 0.007). Following treatment with DFO, hemoglobin concentration increased dramatically by 1.3 to 4.4 g/dl in eight patients but did not change in the remaining eleven. Responders and nonresponders were similar with regard to the degree of aluminum overload both before and after chelation therapy but differed with regard to baseline levels of erythropoietin (higher in responders) and degree of iron overload (greater in nonresponders). Pretherapy levels of red cell ALA dehydratase were depressed in all patients (32 +/- 4 vs. 56 +/- 5 U/g Hb in normals) but did not correlate with the degree of aluminum overload and did not change with chelation therapy. Pretherapy levels of red cell protoporphyrin were elevated in 15 of 24 patients (62%) and were higher in responders than in nonresponders. Following DFO therapy, levels fell by 25 to 50% in 7 of 8 patients with elevated pretherapy values, despite the tendency in several patients to develop iron deficiency with treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We recently showed that the administration of the antidiuretic V2 specific agonist, 1-desamino[8-D-arginine]vasopressin (dDAVP), to seven male patients with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) did not cause a decrease in blood pressure nor an increase in plasma renin activity or factor VIIIc or von Willebrand factor release. In normal subjects, plasma renin activity, coagulation factors and plasma cyclic AMP are stimulated not only by dDAVP but also by the administration of epinephrine. In the present study, we measured tissue plasminogen activator (activity and antigenicity), von Willebrand factor multimers, plasma and urinary cyclic AMP concentrations following dDAVP or epinephrine administration. We infused epinephrine into three male patients with CNDI. Factor VIIIc and tissue plasminogen activator augmented by 75 to 100% and von Willebrand Factor multimers were increased; plasma renin activity and plasma cyclic AMP concentration increased by 200%. None of these values changed when the same subjects as well as eleven other male patients with CNDI received dDAVP. Furthermore, dDAVP administration increased plasma cyclic AMP concentrations in normal subjects, but not in 14 male patients with CNDI. These results demonstrate the specificity of the extrarenal V2 receptor defect expressed in our patients. The lack of a plasma cyclic AMP response to the administration of dDAVP would suggest an altered pre-cyclic AMP stimulation mechanism.\r"

Using a method to detect charge neutralizing substances based on inhibition of binding of the cationic dye Alcian blue 8GX to heparin, plasma and urine from children with SRNS were found to contain a protease-sensitive charge-neutralizing factor, which was not present in plasma or urine of healthy individuals. This factor has been partially purified from SRNS plasma and urine by ion exchange chromatography on QAE Sephadex, gel filtration on Sephadex G150, and FPLC on Mono-S. This cationic protein, which binds to and neutralizes the charge on heparin, may also neutralize the negative charge on the glomerular capillary wall and may thus be involved in the pathogenesis of SRNS.\r"

In order to analyze the influence of rHuEpo therapy on the vessels and the heart, we performed systemic and regional hemodynamics studies in 11 hemodialysis patients before and 10 to 35 weeks after initiation of rHuEpo therapy, when hemoglobin concentration was 6.8 +/- 0.9 and 10.6 +/- 0.66 g/dl (mean +/- SD), respectively. The mean arterial pressure remained unchanged during this period (88 +/- 21 vs. 88 +/- 15 mm Hg). Echocardiographic study showed that rHuEpo treatment led to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (4.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.6 cm; P less than 0.03), left atrial diameter (3.22 +/- 0.30 vs. 3.43 +/- 0.33; P less than 0.03), and left ventricular mass index (109.8 +/- 30.6 vs. 133 +/- 30.8 g/m2; P less than 0.05).

  ".W": "Acute and chronic renal failure are clinical states associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased catabolism. It has been suggested that elevated proteolytic activity is present in the blood in these clinical states. It is, theoretically, possible that the excess blood levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with these disorders stimulate release of proteases, since this latter process is calcium dependent and PTH enhances entry of calcium into cells. The present study examined the effect of PTH and its amino- and carboxyterminal fragments on elastase release from polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL), and evaluated the mechanisms underlying such an action. 1-84 PTH stimulated elastase release from PMNL in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. This effect of the hormone was abolished by its inactivation as well as by the presence of EDTA. Verapamil, trifluoperazine and W-7 reduced but did not abolish the 1-84 PTH-induced stimulation of elastase release from PMNL. Phorbol ester (PMA) also stimulated elastase release but both PTH or PMA-induced elastase release was blunted by staurosporin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C. The 19-84 carboxyterminal PTH also produced significant stimulation of elastase release from PMNL but the amino-terminal 1-34 PTH or other peptide hormones (insulin, calcitonin, and ACTH) had no stimulatory effect on elastase release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four renal pathologists independently scored the AI and CI on 84 renal biopsy specimens from patients with lupus DPGN followed for 109 +/- 74 weeks (mean +/- SD), and the mean score was compared to the development of renal failure and to adverse outcome (combined data for renal failure, death and predefined clinical stop points). Receiver operator characteristic curves were derived from a series of 2 x 2 tables in which one variable was renal failure or adverse outcome and the other variable was AI or CI dichotomized by a cut-off point. Over the entire range (0 to 10) of the CI there was no value that separated patients who developed renal failure from those who did not. The ROC curve analysis indicated that the sensitivity and specificity of the CI were too low to allow it to function as a good test. Once patients entering renal failure were identified, the mean CI approached but did not reach a significant difference when compared to the mean CI of those who did not go into renal failure (4.38 +/- 0.42, mean +/- SE vs. 3.19 +/- 0.23, P = 0.0620). The CI did not predict the adverse clinical outcomes. There was no cut-off value of the CI which separated patients who had an adverse outcome from those who did not, and this result was confirmed by ROC analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, hypercalcemia may develop in a substantial numbers of patients. Thus, to control serum phosphate (PO4) and prevent hypercalcemia, we performed studies in 21 patients on maintenance hemodialysis in which, in addition to the oral administration of CaCO3, the concentration of calcium (Ca) in the dialysate was reduced from 3.25 to 2.5 mEq/liter. The studies were divided in three periods: I. control, on Al-binders (one month); II. no Al-binders (one month); III. CaCO3 (seven months). Blood was obtained three times/week before dialysis for the first five months of the study and once a week for the remaining four months. During the control period, the mean serum calcium was 8.86 +/- 0.08 mg/dl. The value decreased to 8.65 +/- 0.07 mg/dl when phosphate binders containing aluminum were discontinued, and increased to 9.19 +/- 0.07 mg/dl (P less than 0.001 compared to period II) during oral supplementation with calcium carbonate. The mean serum phosphorus was 5.03 +/- 0.07 mg/dl during the control period, and increased to 7.29 +/- 0.91 mg/dl (P less than 0.001) after phosphate binders were discontinued. It decreased to 4.95 +/- 0.06 mg/dl (P less than 0.001) with the administration of calcium carbonate. During CaCO3 administration, serum Al decreased from 64.2 +/- 8.5 to 37.1 +/- 3.6 and 25.1 +/- 3.0 micrograms/liter (P less than 0.001) at three and seven months, respectively.

  ".W": "Mononuclear inflammatory cells were studied using monoclonal antibodies in the interstitium and glomeruli of 35 renal biopsy specimens from patients with lupus nephritis already taking immunosuppressants. The aims of this study were to assess the composition and significance of the infiltrate, and to assess correlations with immediate glomerular function and ability to predict the future course of the disease. The majority of interstitial cells were T lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. The number of interstitial CD4 + ve T helper/inducer lymphocytes was greater than that of CD8 + ve T cytotoxic/suppressor cells in only 19 out of 35 biopsies, the mean CD4:CD8 ratio being only 1.5 +/- 1.2. NK cells and B lymphocytes were a minor component only. Some expression of IL-2, transferrin and C3b receptors was seen on interstitial cells, but HLA-DR expressing cells were much in excess of controls and the numbers of tubular cells expressing HLA-DR was also increased. The number of interstitial T cells, CD4 + ve cells and monocytes/macrophages was highly correlated with the extent of chronic damage judged by optical microscopy. There was also an association between glomerular function at biopsy and numbers of interstitial T cells, CD8 + ve cells, monocytes/macrophages and DR expressing cells. Subsequent decline in renal function, however, was associated only with numbers of monocytes/macrophages and the rather small number of C3b receptor-positive cells. The presence of tubulointerstitial immune aggregates of Ig and/or C in 63% of patients was associated with greater numbers of NK cells. As previously described, the degree of renal function at biopsy correlated with a chronicity index based on optical microscopy. No correlations were found between numbers or types (mostly monocyte/macrophages) of intraglomerular leukocytes and clinical or biopsy features, except that more proliferative types showed greater leukocyte numbers. One hypothesis consistent with our findings is that interstitial T cells and monocytes may be important determinants of pathogenesis and progression of lupus nephritis. While several mechanisms may play an initial role, interstitial monocytes may be the major factor in chronic injury.\r"

On November 3, 1988, nine patients receiving hemodialysis treatments at a single dialysis center suddenly developed hypotension within 30 minutes of onset of dialysis. Eight patients exhibited symptoms and two experienced syncopal episodes; there were no deaths. The incidence of dialysis-associated hypotension occurring within 30 minutes after dialysis onset for these patients was significantly higher during outbreak treatments than during preoutbreak (September 1 through November 2, 1988) treatments, (9 of 9 vs. 0 of 238, P less than 0.00001, Fisher's t-test). Sodium azide, a potent hypotensive agent, was identified as the probable contaminant within the WTS of the dialysis center at the time of the outbreak because: 1) it was mixed with glycerine as the preservative solution of each of the four ultrafilters that were put on-line in the WTS without rinsing, 12 hours before the outbreak; and 2) high levels of total organic carbons were detected from dialysis water collected at point-of-use sites at the time of the outbreak, suggesting contamination of the WTS with the sodium azide-glycerine preservative solution. To prevent similar occurrences, we recommend that ultrafilters (and other components of the WTS) be rinsed free of potentially toxic chemicals prior to use. Dialysis center personnel need to be aware of the potential affects that each modification of disinfection of the WTS may have upon the product water used to prepare dialysate for patient treatments.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were determined in the plasma of long-term hemodialysis (HD) patients and uremic (UR) patients undergoing their first dialysis session using either cellulosic (CUP) or synthetic (PAN-AN 69) membrane-equipped dialyzers. In long-term HD patients, plasma IL-1 and TNF alpha levels were significantly increased compared to their levels in normal subjects. During a single dialysis session, a significant increase in IL-1 but not in TNF alpha was observed. In not yet dialyzed UR patients, IL-1 plasma levels did not differ from those observed in normal subjects. By contrast, TNF alpha was found significantly increased although less than in long-term HD patients. During the first dialysis session, no significant increase was observed in the levels of either monokine. Lastly, regardless of the group of patients, no significant influence of the dialysis membrane could be detected, suggesting that the observed changes are not exclusively secondary to the activation of complement. Altogether, these results suggest that the passage of the blood through the extracorporeal dialysis circuit triggers the secretion of IL-1 and further exacerbates that of TNF alpha by monocytes. The presence of increased TNF alpha in the plasma of first-dialysis UR patients suggests that factors unrelated to dialysis contribute to the activation of monocytes in these patients. Lastly, the concomitant presence of IL-1 and TNF alpha in the plasma of long-term HD patients could be responsible for some of the clinical features observed in these patients, and provides strong evidence favoring the concept that HD can be assimilated to a recurrent acute-phase inflammatory response.\r"

Lymphocyte responses to stimulation with optimal and suboptimal concentrations of lectin (PHA), or stimulation with T cell receptor antibody (Leu 4) were found decreased in the patient cultures. The separate and the combined effects of exogenous interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) were examined in PHA and Leu 4 stimulated cell cultures. Addition of IL-1 did not normalize the decreased proliferation response of the patient cultures. In contrast, addition of IL-2 alone clearly enhanced and almost normalized the response of patient cultures stimulated with suboptimal concentrations of PHA. The combined addition of IL-1 and IL-2 gave no evidence of an additive effect of IL-1 and IL-2. Cell cultures from uremic and normal HLA-identical relative were examined. Substitution of uremic adherent monocytes with normal adherent monocytes as accessory cells did not improve the uremic T cell responses to stimulation with PHA. Furthermore, uremic adherent cells did not suppress the normal T cell responses. These results suggest that uremic accessory cells support T cell activation and, in particular, do not suppress T cell responses. The effect of IL-2 in the present study as well as previous findings of decreased IL-2 production in patients cultures may indicate that uremia primarily influences the proliferation of T cells.\r"

Ten patients received r-HuEPO and the anemia was corrected (Group I). Sixteen patients did not receive r-HuEPO. Ten of them were anemic (Group II) and six had normal hematocrits (Group III). All study groups were matched for age, diagnosis and degree of renal insufficiency. All cohorts were followed prospectively (Period B, from the first day of the study to the time of data analysis or dialysis and transplantation); renal function was also examined retrospectively (Period A, from the first day of the study to the time of first renal function measurement). Hematocrit was lowest in Group II control patients, 27%, highest in the Group III control subjects, 43%, and intermediate in Group I EPO-treated patients, 36%. Serum creatinine uniformly increased in all three groups of patients. The rate of progression, as measured by the slopes of the reciprocal of serum creatinine versus time, however, was similar in all three groups of subjects and during both periods. The mean slopes for Group I patients before and after r-HuEPO were, respectively, -0.0058 and -0.0054, that of the control cohorts with low and normal hematocrit during period B were -0.0063 and -0.0010, respectively. Thus, it appeared that neither r-HuEPO administration nor a normal hematocrit accelerated the deterioration of renal function in these patients with renal insufficiency.\r"

In the two populations, aortic PWV was found to increase with age (P less than 0.0001) and MAP (P less than 0.0001). The presence of aortic calcification showed only a borderline relationship with the increase in aortic PWV (P = 0.050 in CS and P = 0.069 in HD). As change in PWV is directly related to change in distensibility, and the aortic diameters were increased in HD, these results indicate that aortic wall compliance is decreased in HD, resulting in an increase in the pulsatile component of arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Decreased leukocyte glutathione and taurine levels, plasma cyst(e)ine and taurine concentrations and urinary inorganic sulfate, taurine, mercaptolactate and thiosulfate outputs were found in cystinuric patients, probably reflecting intracellular cyst(e)ine deficiency. An increased mercaptoacetate-cysteine mixed disulfide output was found, probably as result of a poor tubular reabsorption of this compound, as well as for cystine. Normal retinal function was recorded in all patients. During drug treatments, the excretion of most of the sulfur compounds in cystinurics was as those found in controls, probably reflecting an increased mobilization of cysteine. N-acetylcysteine treatment increased the excretion of cyst(e)ine and can thus not be recommended as stone preventive therapy in cystinuria.\r"

The number of circulating hemopoietic progenitor cells colony-forming unit-granulocyte-erythrocyte-macrophage (CFU-mix), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) in peripheral blood were assayed weekly by means of a commonly applied in vitro clonal assay. A significant increase of peripheral CFU-mix, BFU-E and CFU-GM could be observed within one week of supplementation therapy in both groups. The increase of BFU-E was followed by a rise of hematocrit within four and three weeks, respectively. These results suggest that the stimulatory in vivo effect of rhEPO administered in therapeutical doses is not restricted to the erythroid lineage but also includes progenitor cells committed to the myeloid lineage (CFU-GM) as well as the multipotent progenitors CFU-mix.

The infusion of CsA (12.5 mg/k body wt) after acute Ux resulted in a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) and a marked increase in renal vascular resistance (RVR). Three weeks following Ux, GFR was also reduced in CsA treated animals as compared to pair-fed controls (0.39 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.67 +/- 0.06 ml/min/100 g, P less than 0.001), but RPF was not (1.97 +/- 0.14 vs 2.19 +/- 0.34 ml/min/100 g). The reduction in GFR seen in rats treated with CsA was fully reversible two weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Three weeks after Ux, kidney weight in CsA-treated animals increased to the level of pair-fed controls (1.50 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.57 +/- 0.06 g) but renal cortical RNA (39.4 +/- 4.3 vs. 49.3 +/- 1.3 micrograms/ml, P less than 0.05), DNA (26.4 +/- 1.7 vs. 34.7 +/- 2.1 micrograms/ml, P less than 0.01), and protein content (6.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.8 +/- 0.2 mg/dl, P less than 0.001) were all markedly reduced.

Marked renal disease and fibrin deposition were noted by three months of age in control mice, whereas little or no disease was seen in ancrod treated mice until five months of age. Similar high titers of anti-DNA antibodies and renal deposition of IgG were seen in both groups of mice. PCA rose with age in both ancrod treated and untreated mice, although it was significantly higher in control animals than in the ancrod treated group. Furthermore, ancrod therapy resulted in a decrease in plasma PCA inducing activity (PIF) and a decrease in the effectiveness of PIF to induce PCA in peritoneal macrophages in vitro. No mortality was observed in the 20 ancrod treated mice, whereas 10 of 20 control animals died. We conclude that defibrination with ancrod delays the development of renal fibrin deposition and glomerulonephritis and improves survival in BXSB mice. This was associated with a decrease in plasma PCA inducing activity and with an inhibitory effect on PCA induction. These results suggest that PCA contributes to injury in murine lupus glomerulonephritis by promoting fibrin deposition.\r"

Since hypotheses concerning the development of gouty and uric acid nephropathy involve a reaction between such cells and crystals, either of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSUM) or uric acid, the reaction between MDCK cells in culture and the above crystals was studied, both morphologically and functionally. In monolayer cultures, reaction sites developed within four hours of exposure to urate crystals. These increased in number for up to 72 hours and subsided gradually after removal of the crystals. At these reaction sites, crystals were observed to have passed beneath the cell surface and could be demonstrated both within intra-cellular lysosomes as well as within the inter-cellular spaces. When the MDCK cells were maintained as single cells in suspension, phagocytosis of crystals by the majority of the cells could be observed, but the response was much more rapid than in monolayers. During the cell/crystal reaction, significant amounts of lysosomal enzymes and prostaglandin E2 were released and, to a less significant degree, cytosolic enzymes, presumably due to cell lysis. This enzyme release did not occur in MDCK cells grown in protein-free medium, and protein coating of the crystals was necessary for reactivity with cells. In this regard, coating with IgG or lysozyme was more effective than albumin. The reaction with uric acid crystals revealed a reactivity which was lesser in degree but qualitatively similar to that of urate crystals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this experiment, we studied uremia and secondary hyperparathyroidism as possible causes of the abnormal calcitriol metabolism. Normal rats were made uremic by infusing phosphorus-free urine for 24 hours. Both the MCR (0.22 +/- 0.01 ml/min/kg, N = 6 P less than 0.001) and the PR (16.6 +/- 1.97 ng/kg/day, P less than 0.01) of calcitriol were significantly suppressed in normal rats following urine infusion when compared to saline infused rats (MCR, 0.30 +/- 0.01; PR, 32.9 +/- 4.1, N = 6). Different levels of protein intake by rats with renal failure produced by subtotal nephrectomy also alter the PR but not the MCR of calcitriol. Thus, the synthesis of calcitriol was significantly lower in rats with renal failure fed a high protein (50% protein) diet (17.6 +/- 0.7 ng/kg/day, N = 8, P less than 0.001) than in rats with renal failure fed a normal protein (20% protein) diet (22.2 +/- 1.4, N = 7). Thyroparathyroidectomy (TPTX) did not alter the MCR of calcitriol in renal failure, even though parathyroid hormone, which may suppress the degradation enzyme, could be elevated in this model of renal failure. The MCR of TPTXed rats with renal failure (0.15 +/- 0.01 ml/min/kg, N = 7) remained lower than that of the TPTXed control rats (0.19 +/- 0.01, N = 7, P less than 0.001), and chronic infusion of PTH to TPTXed rats with renal failure did not change the MCR of calcitriol (0.15 +/- 0.01, vs. control, 0.24 +/- 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The urines of healthy subjects were found to increase the solubility and to strongly inhibit the growth and the agglomeration of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. The urines of stone formers had a similar effect on the solubility, but a significantly lower ability to inhibit the crystal growth and the crystal agglomeration. Of these two kinetic processes the inhibition of crystal agglomeration was more clearly affected, with 55% of the stone formers having abnormally low values, while the changes in crystal growth inhibition occurred within the normal range. The defect in crystal agglomeration inhibition was related to stone frequency, and urines from patients with very high stone frequency rates had also the most severely impaired ability to inhibit the agglomeration of the calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. The inhibitory effect of urines on crystal agglomeration was found to be related to its citrate content (r = 0.68, P less than 0.001). All patients with hypocitraturia, except two, had also abnormally low values for crystal agglomeration inhibition. In a group of 15 hypocitraturic stone formers, alkali treatment for a mean period of 18 months resulted in a parallel increase in urinary citrate excretion and in the ability of urines to inhibit crystal agglomeration (r = 0.77, P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Aluminum intoxication is associated with low osseous remodeling rate and peripheral resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH). The pathophysiological mechanism of these aluminum induced changes was investigated using cultured clonal osteoblastic UMR-106 cells as well as dog renal cortical membrane. Both systems possess high-affinity PTH receptors that are coupled to adenylate cyclase. The UMR-106 cells have typical osteoblastic features, including receptors for the tissue-specific hormones, formation and mineralization of a bone-like ground substance and exclusive synthesis of type 1 collagen. The results show that aluminum at a concentration of 4 microM and 40 microM significantly inhibits the cyclic AMP responses to PTH challenge in UMR-106 cells, and this is associated with significant decrease in the binding to the PTH receptor. At 200 microM, no PTH-responsive adenylate cyclase or binding to receptor can be demonstrated. The effect of aluminum on UMR-106 rat osteosarcoma cells is not due to changes in cell number, cell viability or rate of mitogenesis. Similar results are obtained with dog kidney membrane. At a concentration of 10 microM and 400 microM, there is significant inhibition of the binding of PTH to kidney membrane and proportional decrease in PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase. With higher concentration of aluminum, no response or binding can be demonstrated. In conclusion, aluminum at concentrations of 4 to 400 microM is associated with a decrease in affinity of PTH receptor and concomitant suppression of PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the absence of LPS, circulation of whole blood for two hours through Cup or PS dialyzers was not sufficient to induce production of IL-1 beta or TNF alpha in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) during subsequent 24 hour culture. However, compared to freshly isolated cells, post-HD PBMC were primed to produce more IL-1 beta and TNF alpha when subsequently stimulated with LPS. Despite the lack of spontaneous monokine synthesis after HD, we observed transcription of mRNA coding for IL-1 beta and TNF alpha after two hours of LPS-free HD. When compared to levels of mRNA induced by 5 ng/ml LPS (100%), Cup induced 27 +/- 6% whereas PS did not induce detectable transcription of IL-1 beta. In the case of TNF alpha mRNA, Cup induced 26 +/- 8% and PS 13 +/- 3%. Recombinant C5a induced mRNA for IL-1 beta in PBMC without detectable IL-1 beta protein synthesis. We conclude that transcription of mRNA for IL-1 beta and TNF alpha during HD is primarily caused by complement activation by Cup, but that LPS or other factors are required for translation of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA transcribed during HD.\r"

Convincing signs of axonal degeneration were not found in either of the ethanol-treated groups, nor could the groups be distinguished on the basis of neuroglial cell counts. The presence of degenerating Purkinje cells and cellular atrophy in the granule cell layer does however imply the existence of some degeneration in the medullary layer. Cellular degeneration was found to be occurring in the cerebellar cortex after 4 months of withdrawal from the alcoholic diet as well as immediately after 4 months of alcohol consumption. The medullary layer appears not to be a sensitive indicator of damage in long-term ethanol consumption in the mouse.\r"

The results of that study were confounded by repeating the same exercise using the same muscle groups; the alcohol treatment was always given on the second exercise bout so that the reduced protein leakage may be due to a rapid training effect. The present study was designed to control for rapid training effect when examining the effects of ethanol ingestion on exercise-induced protein leakage from muscle. Also, this study examined the effect of acute ethanol ingestion on other indicators of muscle damage: force generation, muscle stiffness and muscle soreness. Ten women subjects performed two similar exercise regimens, one with each arm, separated by at least 10 days. Alcohol was ingested prior to exercising one arm and a nonalcoholic beverage ingested prior to exercising the contralateral arm. The exercises resulted in increased serum creatine kinase activity (p less than .05) and muscle pain (p less than .01), and decreased range of motion (p less than .01) and strength (p less than .01), indicating muscle damage. There was no significant difference between the alcohol and nonalcohol conditions for any criterion measure. It was concluded that acute ingestion of alcohol has no effect on several indicators of exercise-induced muscle damage.\r"

A total of 79 male and 39 female inpatient alcoholics were administered the following scales: (1) the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) which provides a DSM-III diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (APD) and an antisocial symptom count; (2) the Hare Psychopathy Checklist; (3) the Socialization scale from the California Psychological Inventory (CPI-So); and (4) the MMPI-168 Psychopathic Deviate (Pd) scale. Factor analysis for the four continuous measures (DIS symptom count, Hare, CPI-So, MMPI-168 Pd) resulted in a one factor solution, implying that all four scales measure a single underlying construct. The CPI-So had the highest loading, indicating that this measure has the strongest degree of association with the underlying construct of sociopathy. Results of a discriminant function analysis indicated that only the CPI-So reliably discriminated between alcoholics diagnosed APD and non-APD by the DIS. These findings indicate that CPI-So is a valid and easily administered continuous measure of sociopathy in alcoholic patients.\r"

Data sources were cumulative records of alcohol abuse in health care files and interviews. The estimated relative risk of alcohol abuse for sons of alcoholics versus other men is about 3.5 with both registration and self-report criteria if a broad definition of abuse is adopted. If, however, serious registered abuse and/or medical treatment of alcoholism at or before age 22 is the criterion of abuse, the estimated relative risk is about 10. In both compared samples, father's low education, discontinued family socialization and undisciplined behavior in childhood were antecedents of abuse registered at or before age 22. Self-reported abuse in the 6 months before interview had similar psychosocial correlates in both samples (heavily drinking friends, a positive attitude to heavy drinking, etc.). In both samples about 40% began to drink regularly at 17 or earlier. However, early start of drinking led very frequently to early registered abuse in sons of alcoholics whereas no such contingency was observed in the general male population.\r"

It was found that wine is usually deemed appropriate in integrative, social enjoyment-enhancing situations. Beer use tends to be viewed ambivalently, with a sort of \"cross-situational neutrality\"; its use is neither strongly condoned nor strongly condemned in any of the six social contexts under study. People's attitudes toward the use of distilled spirits are best described as allowing for a \"cautious indulgence\" in this beverage. The respondents tend to favor drinking distilled spirits during integrative social occasions, feel ambivalently toward drinking in social contexts that are simultaneously integrative and disintegrative and disfavor drinking during disintegrative and anxiety-reductive social occasions. Wine cooler use is viewed inconsistently, perhaps with a tendency toward being seen as appropriate for consumption during integrative social occasions that involve having a good time. Sex, income and marital status differences were found to be minimal. Age, though, was found to be a discerning variable in many of these relationships, such that people aged 65 or older were less likely than their younger counterparts to endorse drinking in all of the social contexts under study, except for drinking as a perfect complement to a nice dinner.\r"

Breath alcohol was measured with an infrared absorption unit. Blood and simulator liquid alcohol concentrations were measured by gas chromatography. Breath samples were measured after both low and high exhaled volumes and after rebreathing. Breathing maneuvers were performed after either hyperventilation, breathhold or normal breathing. Inspired air temperature was varied between 0 degree C and 40 degrees C. The rebreathing method for sampling alveolar alcohol samples was evaluated with a new isothermal rebreather that was designed to provide a substantial amount of heat to the rebreathed air in order to heat the airway surfaces. Using a single breath test, the indicated BAC values vary from 14% above the actual BAC to as low as 55% below the actual BAC. Hyperventilation caused a significant decrease in BRAC and breathhold caused a significant increase in BRAC. When isothermal rebreathing is applied to such tests, the breath test results were always within +/- 10% of the true BAC, even with an altered breathing pattern. Isothermal rebreathing provided an accurate sample of alveolar air that was not affected by altered breathing pattern or air temperature.\r"

The questionnaire included quantity-frequency questions on current beverage-specific alcohol use (wine, beer and liquor). The questions were replicated 5 years later for both the earlier period and for current drinking patterns. Results indicated that, in general, original and retrospective data were highly correlated. Only recall of wine, the least frequently drunk beverage, was more highly correlated with current than with original consumption. Frequency of drinking was typically recalled better than quantity per occasion. Beverage-specific absolute alcohol per day (AA) was less reliable than total AA. Retrospective AA values accounted for 86% of the variability in original scores. The heaviest drinkers, however, tended to report disproportionately greater alcohol intake in retrospect. Thus, almost twice as many heavy drinkers were identified on the basis of their retrospective reports compared to those identified by their original reports. Results from this study suggest that considerable confidence can be placed in retrospective reports of total alcohol consumption by nonalcoholic women over a relatively long-term interval and that heavy drinking may be reported more accurately retrospectively than currently.\r"

  ".W": "During 25 years (1960 to 1984), 657 patients (aged 22 to 91, mean 66 years) were operated on for carcinomas (squamous cell, n = 230; adenocarcinoma, n = 399; anaplastic, n = 28) of the thoracic esophagus (n = 347) or gastric cardia (n = 310). Esophagogastrectomy was accomplished in 514 patients, of whom 94% (n = 481) had an \"inkwell\" esophagogastrostomy performed. The hospital mortality rate (less than or equal to 30 days) was 19% and the 5-year cumulative survival rate was 9% +/- 1% (standard error). A Cox regression analysis enabled a detailed risk stratification of the patients. T, N, and M class and age were the strongest predictor variables. The general status of the patients, including pulmonary disease, also had a strong prognostic influence. Eight risk groups were identified having 1-year and 5-year survival rates of 71%/41% (n = 35), 69%/24% (n = 80), 47%/11% (n = 125), 30%/6% (n = 139), 12%/0% (n = 105), 6%/0% (n = 71), 2%/0% (n = 57), and 0%/0% (n = 45) (p less than 0.0001). Hospital mortality (from 6% to 42%) and complication rates increased significantly from the low-risk to high-risk groups. Comparisons with survival rates of background populations matched to each of the first four risk groups indicated that the benefit of surgical treatment may be underestimated if only patient survivals are judged. Use of modern endoscopic and noninvasive tests may yield a reliable TNM classification without surgical exploration. Given the extremely poor prognostic outlook together with high hospital mortality and complication rates of the four last risk groups, an aggressive surgical approach with resection whenever possible can no longer be regarded rational. Selection for surgical treatment should be based on a detailed risk estimation that takes into account both TNM classification and general patient status.\r"

We reviewed the case histories of 48 patients who underwent multimodality treatment for mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumor between 1976 and 1988. Twenty-eight patients received initial therapy at Indiana University and 20 were referred after having had unsuccessful initial therapy elsewhere. In 44 patients (92%) the levels of either one or both serum tumor markers were elevated at the time of diagnosis. Five patients had choriocarcinoma, three embryonal carcinoma, 12 yolk sac carcinoma, four teratocarcinoma, 22 mixed cell type, and two had an unclassified type. Twenty-two of the 28 patients in our initial therapy group had a complete response to treatment, as defined by normal serum tumor markers and absence of residual tumor. In this group, 16 patients had resection of residual disease after chemotherapy, four had total or near total resection before chemotherapy, and only two had chemotherapy alone. Seventeen patients are surviving after this treatment with a median survival of 64 months and a 57% 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival rate. Only two of the 20 patients who were referred for salvage chemotherapy had a complete response. Both required resection of residual disease after salvage chemotherapy. Only one patient survived after this treatment. There was no significant treatment morbidity or mortality. A multimodality approach to primary mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumor with intensive cisplatin-based chemotherapy, emphasis on normalizing serum tumor markers, and aggressive resection of residual disease now offers survival to a significant number of patients.\r"

Factors predicting a poor prognosis were low status of Karnofsky performance, histologic subtype of solid carcinoma with formation of mucus, and T2 and N1 disease. The staging according to American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging did not provide significant information on survival when the variables describing T and N status were included in the Cox model. The new international staging system carried prognostic information because the new stages I and II are identical with the N0 and N1 groups. Groupings of patients according to the prognostic variables defined in this study allow for more detailed prediction of survival than can be achieved solely by T and N groupings. The prognostic information may be used in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and in the selection of patients who might be considered potential candidates for studies of adjuvant treatment.\r"

With standard operative techniques (ventriculotomy and introduction of a hand-held probe or multiple electrode array), it has not always been possible to obtain satisfactory endocardial activation maps during the tachycardia. We have recently developed a new transatrial balloon approach that has greatly facilitated intraoperative mapping. This paper describes our total experience with the new approach and draws attention to details of the cardiopulmonary bypass technique and the surgical approach needed for safe balloon insertion across the mitral valve. We describe how correlation between position of target electrodes on the balloon and the internal geometry of the heart is achieved and discuss the choice and application of appropriate ablation techniques. In our series of 37 consecutive patients, 35% had a grade IV ventricle (ejection fraction less than 20%), 32% had a previous posterior infarct, 51% did not have a resectable aneurysm, and 54% had been receiving amiodarone within 1 month of the operation. These factors have been associated with poor operative results in other series. With the transatrial balloon technique, we were able to induce and map ventricular tachycardia in 100% of patients (average 2.6 +/- 1.3 morphologies per patient). Using a variety of ablation techniques (endocardial excision, cryoablation, or balloon electric shock ablation), we have achieved surgical control of the arrhythmias in 84% of patients with an operative mortality rate of 14%. We recommend transatrial balloon mapping as the procedure of choice for intraoperative identification of arrhythmogenic foci in patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia.\r"

In the interval January 1985 to September 1988, 19 infants and children aged 5 or younger have undergone surgical ablation of accessory conduction pathways because of recurrent supraventricular tachycardia. There were 12 (63%) boys and seven (37%) girls. Age ranged from 4 to 66 months (mean 33.8 months). Nine infants were less than 24 months old. Weight ranged from 5.5 to 2.16 kg (mean 13.2 kg). All 19 patients had symptoms, with duration of symptoms ranging from 3 to 63 months (mean 21 months). Accessory conduction pathways were classified preoperatively as left free wall in four (21%), right free wall in nine (47%), and posterior septal in six (32%). No multiple pathways were recognized preoperatively. Left ventricular function was abnormal in four (21%) preoperatively. Free wall pathways (n = 13) were surgically dissected and septal pathways (n = 6) were cryoablated at -70 degrees C. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 60 +/- 4 minutes. Mean crossclamp time was 42 +/- 2 minutes in those undergoing surgical dissection. Mean postoperative stay was 6.4 +/- 0.2 days. There were no deaths, no significant postoperative complications, and no instance of complete heart block. All patients were considered cured at the time of discharge. At a mean follow-up of 12.7 months, 18 (94.7%) remain cured. One patient with Ebstein's anomaly and a right free wall pathway had a recurrent supraventricular tachycardia 3 months postoperatively, and repeat electrophysiologic study has shown a previously unsuspected anterior septal pathway. Ventricular function returned to normal in all four patients who had abnormal function preoperatively. Surgical ablation of accessory conduction pathways can be safely done in infants and small children with results equal to those obtained in adults.\r"

Starting in June 1985, 23 surgical angioplasties have been performed in 22 patients. The left main stem was approached posteriorly in the first 11 patients, and an anterior approach was preferred in the last 12 because of better exposure. The onlay patch consisted of saphenous vein in the first 14 patients; pericardium was preferred in the last nine. The five failures occurred early. Four of these occurred in patients older than 60 years in whom calcifications of the left main stem had been seen on the preoperative angiogram. Eighteen procedures (78.3%) succeeded, but one patient (5.5%) died later of a massive air embolism. The 17 survivors are free of symptoms (maximal stress test combined with thallium scintigraphy) after a mean follow-up of 24.3 months. Angiographic restudy at an average of 8 months was obtained in 14 patients (82.3%) and revealed an excellent result in 13. In five patients, a late angiographic restudy (22 to 37 months) still revealed perfect patency of the left main stem. Provided that well-defined contraindications (calcifications, involvement of the distal bifurcation, older age) are respected, surgical angioplasty deserves a place in the array of surgical strategies.\r"

The inferior epigastric artery was dissected through an infraumbilical incision without entrance into the peritoneal cavity. The results depend on the technique used for the aortoepigastric anastomosis. When a segment of saphenous vein or a patch of bovine pericardium was sutured to a large aortic orifice with the inferior epigastric artery previously anastomosed to these patches, the patency rate of the free grafts in the early postoperative period was 100%. Histologic examination showed identical structure of the inferior epigastric artery and the internal mammary artery. Application of the inferior epigastric artery is an attempt to increase the use of arterial grafts for myocardial revascularization.\r"

This approach consists of debridement and immediate closure with a pectoral musculocutaneous flap. The following report describes 31 patients treated by such a method. Compared with results of previous techniques in treating sternal wound infections, hospital study is decreased, fewer reoperations are needed, and patient management is simplified.\r"

  ".W": "To determine possible mechanisms by which omental pedicles protect bronchial anastomoses from ischemia, we studied the angiogenic potential of a lipid extract of omentum. A rabbit cornea model was used to quantify neovascularization produced by methanol-chloroform extract of homogenized autologous omentum or perirenal fat. In 22 anesthetized rabbits, 10 microliters of omental lipid extract was injected into the cornea. In each animal the opposite eye was used as a control and was injected with a similar volume of extract prepared from perirenal fat. The side of injection of autologous omental fat was randomized and was not known to the investigator who assessed neovascularization on days 4, 7, 14, and 21 after injection. Neovascularization was recorded on microphotography and quantified by a point-counting method. Four days after injection, neovascularization in corneas injected with autologous omental fat was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than in control corneas for all indices of neovascularization including total point count, which was three times greater than control. The angiogenic effect diminished with time, and by 21 days after injection corneal neovascularization was comparable for the two groups. Our results suggest that the lipid fraction of omentum has angiogenic activity that may stimulate neovascularization in ischemic tissues. Lack of sustained activity may be due to washout by neovessels or local tissue metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "There are conflicting reports of the detrimental or beneficial effects of hypothermic cardioplegia in the immature heart. We therefore investigated the temperature-dependence of myocardial protection and the ability of single-dose and multidose infusions of cardioplegic solution to protect the immature heart during hypothermic ischemia. Isolated, working hearts (n = 6 per group) from neonatal rabbits (aged 7 to 10 days) were perfused aerobically (37.0 degrees C) for 20 minutes before infusion (2 minutes) with either perfusion fluid (noncardioplegia control) or St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution and ischemic arrest (for 4, 6, and 18 hours) at various temperatures between 10.0 degrees and 30.0 degrees C. Hearts arrested with cardioplegic solution received either one preischemic infusion only (single-dose cardioplegia) or repeated infusions at intervals of 60 or 180 minutes (multidose cardioplegia). Ischemic arrest with single-dose cardioplegia for 4 hours at 10.0 degrees, 20.0 degrees, 22.5 degrees, 25.0 degrees, 27.5 degrees, and 30.0 degrees C resulted in 96.0% +/- 4.3%, 96.6 +/- 2.5%, 87.0% +/- 3.8%, 71.8% +/- 10.0% (p less than 0.05 versus 10.0 degrees C group), 35.1% +/- 10.3% (p less than 0.01 versus 10.0 degrees C group), and 3.0% +/- 1.9% (p less than 0.04 versus 10.0 degrees C group) recovery of preischemic cardiac output, respectively. With 6 hours of ischemia at 20.0 degrees C, single-dose cardioplegia significantly (p less than 0.01) increased the recovery of cardiac output from 20.9% +/- 13.1% (control) to 76.4% +/- 4.4%, whereas multidose cardioplegia (infusion every 60 minutes) further increased recovery to 97.8% +/- 3.8% (p less than 0.01 versus control and single-dose cardioplegia). In contrast, after 6 hours of ischemia at 10.0 degrees C, cardiac output recovered to 93.4% +/- 1.2% (control) and 92.3% +/- 3.1% (single-dose cardioplegia), whereas multidose cardioplegia reduced recovery to 76.9% +/- 2.2% (p less than 0.01 versus both groups). This effect was confirmed after 18 hours of ischemia at 10.0 degrees C; single-dose cardioplegia significantly increased the recovery of cardiac output from 24.5% +/- 10.9% (control) to 62.9% +/- 13.3% (p less than 0.05), whereas multidose cardioplegia reduced recovery to 0.8% +/- 0.4% (p less than 0.01 versus single-dose cardioplegia) and elevated coronary vascular resistance from 8.90 +/- 0.56 mm Hg.min/ml (control) to 47.83 +/- 9.85 mm Hg.min/ml (p less than 0.01). This effect was not reduced by lowering the infusion frequency (from every 60 to every 180 minutes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hypothermia combined with pharmacologic cardioplegia protects the globally ischemic adult heart, but this benefit may not extend to children, resulting in poor postischemic recovery of function and increased mortality. The relative susceptibilities to ischemia modified by hypothermia alone and by hypothermia plus cardioplegia were assessed in isolated perfused neonatal (3- to 4-day-old) rabbit and pig hearts. Hearts were perfused aerobically with Krebs buffer solution in the working mode for 30 minutes and aortic flow was recorded. This was followed by 3 minutes of hypothermic (14 degrees C) coronary perfusion with either Krebs or St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution No. 2 followed by hypothermic (14 degrees C) global ischemia (rabbits 2, 4, and 6 hours; pigs 2 and 4 hours). Hearts were reperfused for 15 minutes in the Langendorff mode and 30 minutes in the working mode, and recovery of postischemic aortic flow was measured. Hypothermia alone provided excellent protection of the ischemic neonatal rabbit heart, with recovery of aortic flow after 2 and 4 hours of ischemia at 91% +/- 4% and 87% +/- 5% (mean +/- standard deviation) of its preischemic value. Recovery after 6 hours of ischemia was depressed to 58% +/- 9% of its preischemic value. Ischemic neonatal pig hearts protected with hypothermia alone recovered 94% +/- 3% of preischemic aortic flow after 2 hours; none was able to generate flow after 4 hours. St. Thomas' Hospital solution No. 2 decreased postischemic aortic flow after 4 hours of ischemia in rabbit hearts from 87% +/- 5% to 70% +/- 7% (p less than 0.05, hypothermia alone versus hypothermia plus cardioplegia) but improved postischemic recovery of aortic flow in pig hearts after 4 hours of ischemia from 0 to 73% +/- 13% (p less than 0.0001, hypothermia alone versus hypothermia plus cardioplegia). This effect was dose related in both species. We conclude that the neonatal pig heart is more susceptible to ischemia modified by hypothermia alone than the neonatal rabbit and that St. Thomas' Hospital solution No. 2 improves postischemic recovery of function in the neonatal pig but decreases it in the neonatal rabbit. This species-dependent protection of the neonatal heart may be related to differences in the extent of myocardial maturity at the time of study.\r"

  ".U": "90135253\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1964 and 1987, a total of 57 cases of ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva underwent surgical correction at the National Taiwan University Hospital. This represents 0.96% of all cardiac operations. The origin of ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva was the right coronary sinus in 46, the noncoronary sinus in nine, and the left coronary sinus in two. The aneurysms ruptured into the right ventricle in 44, into the right atrium in 11, into the left ventricle in one, and into both the right ventricle and right atrium in one. Associated congenital cardiac anomalies included ventricular septal defect in 30 patients, aortic regurgitation in 20, and infundibular pulmonic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta in one each. Operative death occurred in two patients (3.5%) and one patient had a successful reoperation. The remainder did well following surgery. To compare the differences between Oriental and Western countries in ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva, 361 cases (195 Oriental patients versus 166 Western) were collected from the literature. Analyses of these cases revealed that ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva in Oriental patients compared with Western series is characterized by a higher incidence (5 times), more aneurysms originating from the right coronary sinus (87.9% versus 63.6%), more aneurysm rupturing into the right ventricle (84.2% versus 56.6%), a higher incidence of association with ventricular septal defect (mainly supracristal) (59.0% versus 34.6%), less incidence of association with other congenital cardiac abnormalities (4.1% versus 21.5%), very few instances of rupturing into cardiac chambers other than the right ventricle and right atrium, and less incidence of occurrence in the extremities of ages (the youngest was 7 years in Oriental patients versus 11 months in the Western series). In other words, ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva in Oriental patients is more or less a simple and uniform disease entity in contrast to the more diverse and protean pathologic profiles encountered in Western series. However, both Oriental patient and Western patient series have similar incidences of combination with aortic regurgitation (24.6% versus 20.0%), with 40.4% of Oriental patients and 60.6% of Western patients presenting with intact ventricular septum. Therefore the pathogenetic mechanisms of ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva may at the same time contribute to the development of aortic regurgitation.\r"

The depth of the scoop in relation to the disposition of the atrioventricular valves has been debated. To clarify the relation between the morphology of the ventricular septum and the disposition of the atrioventricular valves, we quantified these anatomic features in 151 hearts at autopsy to determine whether those features identified particular groups within the overall lesion. We found that 137 hearts had left atrioventricular valves with three leaflets. The left valve in the other 14 hearts exhibited a dual orifice, a two-leaflet or one-leaflet arrangement, or was imperforate. These anomalies could be analyzed in terms of a sequence of diminishing formation of the commissures. Also, three-leaflet valves displayed a variability in which the angular size of the mural leaflet correlated negatively with that of the inferior leaflet. In some of the hearts with a common atrioventricular orifice, the bridging leaflets did not meet over the ventricular septum, thus creating a \"gap.\" The mural leaflet's angular size corresponded to a deficiency of the combined inferior-mural leaflet complex. Hearts with an abnormal disposition of the left atrioventricular valve had the ventricular septum \"scooped\" to a greater extent than those with a common orifice, although most had separate right and left atrioventricular orifices.\r"

  ".W": "From April 1986 to September 1988, 12 patients with double- or common-inlet left ventricle and left anterior rudimentary right ventricle underwent septation while 17 patients with double- or common-inlet left or right ventricle underwent the Fontan operation. In the septation group, three patients who had pressure gradients ranging from 10 to 85 mm Hg between the left ventricle and the aorta underwent enlargement of the outlet foramen, and all survived. One of the 12 patients had a common atrioventricular valve that was repaired by separating the atrioventricular valve by the procedure used for atrioventricular septal defect. One had complete heart block before septation and the other one had it after separation. One 17-year-old woman, who had the smallest left ventricle (168% of normal), died in the hospital (mortality, 8.3%). In the Fontan group, one patient who died in the hospital (5.9%) had high pulmonary resistance of 4.4 U/m2, and one late death (5.9%) occurred in a patient who had complete heart block and a high mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 20 mm Hg. Because of suprasystemic pressure in the pulmonary ventricle, two patients had immediate takedown of the septation repair and substitution of the Fontan repair. Although right atrial pressure was almost equal in both groups after operation, the cardiac index was significantly higher in the septation group than in the Fontan repair group (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that patients who are candidates for either septation or Fontan repair might fare better with septation.\r"

Median age at repair was 4.3 months and median weight was 4.4 kg. Early deaths (3%) were confined to two infants with preoperative respiratory tract infections; a further two patients died during follow-up (late mortality rate 3%). Reoperation for severe postoperative mitral regurgitation was necessary in 10 infants (16%), two of whom subsequently required mitral valve replacement with a prosthesis. Preoperative atrioventricular valve regurgitation was assessed retrospectively in 49 patients from angiography or Doppler echocardiography and was found to be absent or mild in 33 (68%), moderate in 9 (18%), and severe in 7 (14%). At the time of latest review (at a mean of 2.4 years after repair), judged from a combination of clinical and echocardiographic criteria, mitral regurgitation was absent or mild in 49 (84%) of the 58 survivors; none of them had symptomatic regurgitation or were requiring continuing medical treatment. Analysis of sequential atrioventricular valve function in 46 of the 49 patients in whom objective preoperative data were available showed no relationship between the degree of preoperative and postoperative atrioventricular valve regurgitation. Infants without Down's syndrome, however, had a significantly higher reoperation rate for severe postoperative mitral valve regurgitation (50%) than those with Down's syndrome (10%) (p = 0.007). Complete atrioventricular septal defect can be repaired in early infancy with a low mortality rate and good intermediate term results.\r"

Eighteen patients (16 men and two women aged 54 +/- 7 years, New York Heart Association class I-II) undergoing low flow (flow rate 1.5 L/min/m2 at 26 degrees C), low pressure (mean arterial pressure 40 to 60 mm Hg) cardiopulmonary bypass, as well as 10 age-matched and sex-matched patients undergoing normal flow (flow rate 2.2 L/min/m2 at 26 degrees C), normal pressure (mean arterial pressure 60 to 80 mm Hg) bypass were studied. Intracellular acid-base equilibrium (intracellular pH and intracellular bicarbonate), cell energetics (adenosine triphosphate, diphosphate, and monophosphate, phosphocreatine, and lactate), and muscle water compartments were evaluated in specimens of the quadriceps femoris muscle obtained by needle biopsy before and at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass. In both the low flow-low pressure and normal flow-normal pressure groups, adenosine triphosphate levels were unchanged at the end of bypass, whereas phosphocreatine concentration was decreased; muscle total water and extracellular water increased without variations of intracellular water; muscle and plasma lactate increased as intracellular bicarbonate decreased; intracellular pH values remained unchanged. The present study suggests the following: (1) Cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with the overall preservation of intracellular compartment metabolism in skeletal muscle (about 40% of body cell mass) of patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting, even though low phosphocreatine values and increased plasma and muscle lactate values found at the end of bypass could be an expression of cell functional reserve exhaustion; (2) the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass on cell metabolism are comparable, regardless of the flows and pressures used.\r"

After an initial administration of 4 degrees C crystalloid cardioplegic solution by antegrade aortic perfusion, myocardial protection was established either by right atrial perfusion cooling (group I; n = 6) or by antegrade aortic perfusion alone (group II; n = 6). The right ventricular temperature was approximately 15 degrees C in group I and 20 degrees C in group II. After ischemia for 60 minutes, the adenosine triphosphate content of the right ventricular free wall was significantly higher in group I than in group II (24.4 +/- 1.45 versus 13.8 +/- 2.34 mumol/gm dry weight, p less than 0.05). The percent recovery of right ventricular contractility, which was evaluated by end-systolic pressure-volume relationships, was significantly better in group I at each reperfusion period (30 minutes: 130.0% +/- 9.6% versus 86.1% +/- 11.8%, p less than 0.05; 60 minutes: 159.6% +/- 12.9% versus 96.5% +/- 20.1%, p less than 0.05). Postischemic right ventricular stiffness (reciprocal value of compliance) increased in group II compared with group I, although the difference was not statistically significant. There were no major differences in percent recovery of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationships between the two groups. The evidence suggests that the right atrial perfusion cooling method produces excellent right ventricular protection.\r"

We created a model to study the regional flow distribution of cardioplegic solutions in nondiseased, diastolically arrested, maximally vasodilated canine hearts. Global and regional myocardial flows were measured at different perfusion pressures in hearts perfused either with blood cardioplegic solution (n = 8) or oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution (n = 2). As coronary perfusion decreased, flow in all layers fell significantly (p less than 0.001). This fall was most dramatic in the subendocardium (p less than 0.05). With both types of cardioplegic solutions, the relationship between pressure and flow was nonlinear: At low coronary perfusion pressures, a given change in pressure resulted in a smaller change in flow than at higher perfusion pressures. In addition, we found that in all dogs and at all pressures there was profound variability in the delivery of cardioplegic solution to different small regions of the left ventricular free wall. At a perfusion pressure of 40 mm Hg, the extremes of regional flow differed on average by 203%. This heterogeneity increased significantly with decreasing perfusion pressures. At the lowest perfusion pressure measured (20 mm Hg), the extremes of regional flow differed on average by 365%. These findings emphasize the importance of coronary pressure on the delivery of cardioplegic solution. At low perfusion pressures, not only is mean flow reduced, but a greater number of regions receive limited amounts of cardioplegic solution. These observations may explain the patchy nature of subendocardial damage seen with inadequate myocardial protection.\r"

Twelve patients (group A) received unrefrigerated fresh whole blood, 12 (group B) received fresh whole blood after 5 hours' storage at 4 degrees C, and 12 (group C) after 24 hours' storage at 4 degrees C. For evaluation of platelet function, a method with an extracellular matrix and an electron microscope was used. The platelet function was graded from 1 to 4, with grade 4 being normal aggregation. Postoperatively, group A patients bled less than groups B and C (267 +/- 42 versus 397 +/- 72 and 601 +/- 172 ml/24 hr, respectively, p less than 0.001) and therefore received fewer blood units (1.4 +/- 0.5 versus 2 +/- 0.9 and 3 +/- 1.4, respectively, p less than 0.01). Five patients of group A (42%) reached grade A aggregation after transfusion of unstored fresh whole blood, compared with two (17%) of group B and none (0%) of group C (p less than 0.01). Posttransfusion platelet count and mean platelet volume were not significantly different in the three groups. We conclude that storage at 4 degrees C, even for a short period of 5 hours, diminishes the hemostatic effect of fresh whole blood by decreasing platelet aggregability.\r"

All patients had an asymptomatic thoracic lesion discovered on a plain chest film 9 to 32 years (mean 16) after the initial accident.

The common truncus arteriosus was septated with a patch into aortic and pulmonary segments and the ventricular septal defect was closed through a ventriculotomy. A direct anastomosis between the pulmonary arteries and the right ventricle was performed, the anterior wall being constructed with a patch with a monocusp valve. There was one death in the immediate postoperative period. In the surviving six patients the postoperative right ventricular/left ventricular peak systolic pressure ratio was less than 0.51 in five and 0.60 in one with a residual ventricular septal defect. All are in functional class I between 1 and 14 months after the operation. On the basis of these results, we propose this technique for patients with truncus type I or II in the first year of life.\r"

At 4 1/2-8 1/2 months, 18 of 20 patients had neutralisation titres such that at least 50% of a dose of 1.5 million units of streptokinase would have been neutralised. After 8 months, neutralisation titres ranged from 0.4 to 2.0 million units in 8 patients. A decision to readminister streptokinase within 8 months (and probably up to 1 year) of previous thrombolytic treatment should take account of the neutralising capacity of plasma and the dose should be adjusted accordingly.\r"

When heartburn or acid regurgitation clearly dominated the patient's complaints, they had very high specificity (89% and 95%, respectively) but low sensitivity (38% and 6%) for GORD. A third of the patients reported such inconclusive symptomatology at history-taking that no preliminary diagnosis about the presence or absence of GORD could be made. In the remaining 200 patients, a clinical diagnosis by history had a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 60%. A discriminant analysis of symptoms was inferior to a history taken by an experienced gastroenterologist.\r"

More HIV-seronegative than HIV-seropositive patients were receiving antituberculous chemotherapy and had ascites at enrollment. Only 5 of 28 HIV-seropositive patients had clinical signs of AIDS. 9 of 14 HIV-seropositive patients tested had positive Mantoux tests. There were no significant differences between the HIV-seropositive and seronegative groups in the duration of symptoms, laboratory results, X-ray or ultrasound findings, frequency of tamponade, or mortality. 38 patients were treated for tuberculosis. Pericardial effusion is strongly associated with, and an early manifestation of, HIV infection in Tanzania.\r"

Plasma cortisol concentrations peaked at 1 hour (about 4000 nmol/l) following intramuscular injection and declined thereafter. After rectal administration, levels peaked at between 1 and 2 hours and persisted for 8 or more hours. Similar levels were achieved at 4 hours (about 1000 nmol/l) by both methods of administration.

The initial attendance rate was 61% but this varied according to age and socioeconomic status and decreased over succeeding years. The cancer detection rate was 6.2 per 1000 women attending at the first visit; the rate fell to around 3 per 1000 in the years when mammography was routinely repeated and to around 1 per 1000 at the intervening visits with clinical examination alone as the screening method. After 7 years of follow-up the mortality reduction achieved was 17% (relative risk = 0.83, 95% CI 0.58-1.18), which was not statistically significant, even when corrected for socioeconomic status. In women aged 50 years and over a mortality reduction of 20% was achieved.\r"

After 2 weeks of erythropoietin, mean (SEM) uroporphyrinogen-l synthase activity increased significantly from 88 (10) to 116 (9) pmol/h per mg protein. Haem synthase activity, thought to be the rate-limiting step in erythroid haem synthesis, also showed a significant increase from 4.5 (0.8) to 8.4 (1.8) pmol/h per 10(6) reticulocytes. 4 patients, who showed only a partial response to erythropoietin, had significantly higher serum aluminium concentrations than the 7 who responded fully (225 [44] vs 55 [23] micrograms/l); erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentrations in partial responders were also much higher than in responders (973 [120] vs 388 [29] nmol/l). Aluminium intoxication may cause resistance to erythropoietin by interference with haem synthesis, with accumulation of protoporphyrin.\r"

The studies were repeated six months postoperatively, and after six months in the healthy children. Preoperatively, 61% of the children had degrees of sleep hypoxaemia above normal and 65% had abnormally disturbed sleep. A questionnaire administered to the parents about their children showed abnormal patterns of answers about sleep problems daytime sleepiness, hyperactivity, aggression, learning difficulties, restless sleep, and odd sleeping positions. After adenotonsillectomy, the abnormal hypoxaemia, excessive sleep disturbance, and multiple symptoms almost resolved; a growth spurt also occurred.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular basis of hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) was studied in 50 subjects (41 pedigrees, 82 apparently independent mutant alleles of aldolase B) by direct analysis of aldolase B genes amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction. The mutation A149P (ala 149----pro) was found in 67% of alleles but was significantly more common in patients from northern than from southern Europe. Two other point mutations of aldolase B were identified. A174D (C----A; ala 174----asp) was found in subjects from Italy, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia (overall frequency 16%) but not in those from the United Kingdom, France, or the United States. L288 delta C carried a single base-pair deletion causing frameshift at codon 288 and was restricted to Sicilian subjects. By testing for these mutations in amplified DNA with a limited panel of allele-specific oligonucleotides, more than 95% of HFI patients will be susceptible to genetic diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "To find out whether apparent seronegativity in patients strongly suspected of having Lyme disease can be due to sequestration of antibodies in immune complexes, such complexes were isolated and tested for antibody to Borrelia burgdorferi. In a blinded analysis the antibody was detected in all 10 seronegative Lyme disease patients with erythema chronicum migrans (ECM), in none of 19 patients with other diseases, and in 4 of 12 seronegative patients who probably had Lyme disease but had no ECM. These findings were confirmed by western blot, which also showed that immune complex dissociation liberated mainly antibody reactive to the 41 kD antigen and sometimes antibody to an approximate 30 kD antigen. Complexed B burgdorferi antibody was also found in 21 of 22 (95%) of seropositive patients with active disease, 3 additional seronegative but cell mediated immune reactive patients, and 3 other seronegative patients who eventually became seropositive. Apparent B burgdorferi seronegativity in serum immune complexes may thus be due to sequestration of antibody in immune complexes.\r"

Similar behaviour by benign lymphocytes may explain the symmetry and selective anatomical distribution of lesions in other skin diseases.\r"

Physiological variables were recorded every minute in the four hours before transfer (ICU group only), during the move, and for four hours afterwards. Pretransfer insults were predictive of further insults during and after transport. There was significant correlation between increased frequency of insults post-transfer (compared with pre-transfer) and high injury severity score. A greater proportion of the patients transported from the emergency department had secondary injuries post-transfer. Adequate resuscitation before moving the patient, especially in patients with multiple injury, is important.\r"

  ".W": "Features of patients transferred to a regional neurosurgical unit in coma after recent head injury were compared with a similar audit seven years previously. There were fewer avoidable adverse factors in the recent series, but some patients received inadequate care of the airway, while in some others major extracranial injuries were overlooked or poorly managed. Only 42% of the comatose patients had had an endotracheal tube inserted; half those in whom neither a tube nor an oral airway had been inserted were transported supine. Systemic hypoxia or hypotension [corrected] were associated with a poor outcome. Even when computed tomography scanners become available in more hospitals, many patients who are unconscious after head injury will still need to be transferred to a neurosurgical unit. Detailed guidelines should be agreed locally to minimise the hazards of transfer of unconscious patients between hospitals. A rota of experienced doctors and nurses at the sending hospital should be responsible for deciding how each individual patient should be managed during transfer, according to the guidelines. Continuing audit of such cases is needed to indicate whether revision of local practice is needed.\r"
