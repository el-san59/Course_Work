A control group receiving no neuromuscular blocking drugs was also studied. Grip strength and PEF were reduced significantly in all groups (less than 80% of preoperative value) 15 min after operation. This was most marked following infusion of vecuronium (less than 50%). Grip strength recovered in all groups in 30-60 min. PEF was still significantly less than control value at 90 min in all groups receiving neuromuscular blocking drugs.\r"

  ".W": "We present a new pattern of nerve stimulation--double burst stimulation (DBS)--to detect residual neuromuscular block manually. The DBS consists of two short lasting, 50-Hz tetanic stimuli or bursts separated by a 750-ms interval. The response to this pattern of stimulation is two single separated muscle contractions of which the second is less than the first during nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade. The ability to identify fade manually at different train-of-four (TOF) ratios was compared in four DBS patterns in which different numbers of impulses in the individual bursts were combined. The DBS with three impulses in each burst (DBS3,3) was considered to be the most sensitive and the least painful and thus most suitable for clinical use. The degree of fade in TOF and DBS3,3 was almost identical at any level of blockade (correlation coefficient 0.96), and the major post-DBS3,3 effect was a depression of the first twitch in TOF lasting less than 15 s. It is concluded that the DBS is more sensitive than the TOF in manual detection of residual block.\r"

The responses of adductor pollicis were measured during onset and recovery of neuromuscular block for each agent. There was a drug-related disparity between mechanomyogram (MMG) and electromyogram (EMG) measurement of the first response of the train-of-four (T1) and of the ratio of the fourth (T4) to the first response (TOF ratio). There were significantly higher T1 values for the EMG than for MMG during alcuronium blockade (P = 0.03). For tubocurarine, however, the relationship was reversed. The relationship between T1 and TOF ratio during onset and recovery of neuromuscular block was a hysteresis. The TOF ratio at 50% T1 was significantly higher during onset than during recovery for all three drugs, measured by MMG or EMG (P less than 0.005). Analysis of variance of the differential fade loops failed to show a drug-related effect. We conclude that care should be taken in assuming interchangeability between MMG and EMG measurement of T1. Relationships between T1 and TOF ratio derived during recovery do not necessarily apply during onset and may lead to error in estimating the degree of muscle relaxation.\r"

A further six patients in whom anaesthesia was supplemented with thiopentone acted as a control group. Halothane 1.5% resulted in a significant decrease in overall amplitude (P less than 0.05) from the left leg only. Halothane had no significant effect on overall amplitude, first peak amplitude, second peak amplitude and first peak latency. We conclude that halothane is unlikely to alter the interpretation of somatosensory evoked potentials recorded extradurally during scoliosis surgery. A possible unilateral effect of halothane on the concave side in idiopathic adolescent scoliosis needs further investigation.\r"

Between 1 March 1987 and 29 February 1988, all 1328 women attending the antenatal clinic were offered an HIV screening test, 982 accepted and the other 346 declined to be tested. Two of the 982 tested women were found to be HIV-1 antibody positive. Two other pregnant HIV-1-positive women were identified during this time, one was tested in the genitourinary medicine clinic and the other whilst an in-patient for drug withdrawal. All except one of the 12 HIV-1-antibody-positive pregnant women were in known high-risk groups. In addition up to March 1988, 32 heterosexual men were identified as HIV-1 antibody positive and 22 of these were intravenous drug abusers. If the present trend continues, more women will become infected, often unaware that they are at risk and this may not be detected unless HIV testing is offered to all pregnant women and widely accepted. Decisions on local policy should be based on the available estimates of prevalence of HIV infection in that community.\r"

The distribution of body-mass index, used as an indicator of maternal nutritional status, was similar to the pattern seen in Sweden, although mean maternal height (156 cm) was 9 cm below that of Swedish women. Mean initial weight measured at week 14 was 53 kg and total pregnancy weight gain was 6 kg. Women weighing greater than or equal to 60 kg in early pregnancy gained less weight (0.16 kg/week) than those weighing less than 50 kg (0.22 kg/week). Birthweight was correlated both with maternal weight in early pregnancy and with weight gain during pregnancy, but only 10% of the variation in birthweight was explained by these maternal factors. Mean maternal weight 24 h postpartum was equal to the weight at 14 weeks of pregnancy, implying, on the average, no net weight gain. Women with a positive net weight gain had heavier babies than women with a negative net weight gain. Maternal anthropometric characteristics are important underlying determinants of intrauterine growth and birthweight, but they explain only a minor part of the variation and are of little value for screening purposes in individual women.\r"

There was no significant difference in protein S levels between pregnancy, labour and puerperium. On the other hand, maternal plasma protein C levels during pregnancy and before delivery were similar to those in controls, but a significant increase was found during the third stage of labour. This increase did not persist into the early puerperium. The observed increase in protein C level immediately after delivery in our study may represent a physiological response to counter the tendency towards venous thrombosis in the parturient women, and may help to explain the almost negligible occurrence of thromboembolism in Chinese obstetric patients.\r"

The improved outcome of labour associated with the prior administration of PGE2 when the cervix is unripe, including reduced induction-to-delivery intervals and higher rates of vaginal delivery was maintained. Apart from some minor side-effects, there were no adverse effects noted as a direct consequence of the tocolytic; blood loss was not increased, although one patient suffered an intrapartum abruption.

Excluding pH readings made in the presence of pathogenic organisms, 120 readings were taken. The mean vaginal pH of all subjects was 4.16 (SD 0.41). Analysis of variance showed no significant within-subject variation of pH during pregnancy. Two women had spontaneous preterm deliveries (less than 37 weeks) and their mean vaginal pH during pregnancy was 5.05 and 5.06. Eight women admitted in preterm labour, who then gave birth, had a mean pH of 5.43 (SD 0.94) which was significantly higher than the mean pH of 10 women in labour at term (4.58, SD 0.59). The relation between bacterial growth in vitro and the surrounding pH was also examined. Escherichia coli, a potential pathogen, behaved differently from both Lactobacillus (a commensal organism) and Candida albicans. The clinical observations show a trend towards higher vaginal pH values in association with preterm labour.\r"

A control group of 81 gestational-age-matched women whose pregnancy ended in the delivery of a healthy infant at term were similarly questioned. The use of alcohol by women and men was equally frequent in both groups. Before pregnancy, the mean alcohol consumption per week had been about 1-2 drinks for the women and 4-5 drinks for the men. During the presumed day of conception, 13% of the women who miscarried and 11% of the women in the control group had drunk on average 3-4 drinks; the other women had been abstinent at this time. Of the partners, 13% and 15%, respectively, had taken a mean of 4-5 drinks. In both groups 58% of the subjects continued to consume alcohol during pregnancy. The mean consumption was about one drink a week by the women who miscarried and half a drink a week in the control group. Of women who miscarried, 36 had a blighted ovum and in this subgroup alcohol consumption in both women and men was similar to that in the other women who miscarried and their partners, suggesting that alcohol is not causally related to the development of a blighted ovum. These results suggest that moderate maternal or paternal alcohol consumption does not increase the risk of miscarriage.\r"

Details about the men, their marriages and each wife or wives were obtained from the population registry in the parish in which the men lived or had died. The personal identification number and name of each wife or wives were matched against the cancer registry. All genital cancers, including 15 cervical cancers, were distributed equally among the wives of the cases and those of the controls. The expected rate of cancers among the population of wives of cases was also calculated and there was no difference between the observed and the expected number of women with cancer. The results did not show an association between penile cancer in men and cervical cancer in their sexual partners.\r"

The results strongly confirm the findings from the first study and indicate that an estimated 38% of blinding cataract may be attributable to repeated dehydrational crises resulting from severe life threatening diarrhoeal disease and/or heatstroke. The risk of blinding cataract was strongly related to level of exposure to dehydrational crises in a consistent and dose dependent manner, thus indicating a causal association. The findings are discussed in relation to possible sources of bias in the study, confounding in the data, and the steps that were taken to minimise their undesirable effects.\r"

The association between these two important complications of preterm birth has led us to postulate that an episode of hypoperfusion of the cerebral circulation sufficient to result in cerebral ischaemia could also reduce an already compromised ocular blood flow and further exacerbate retinal ischaemia, thereby increasing the severity of ROP.\r"

RP patients had raised short-term adaptation and increment threshold levels, but their rate of short-term or photopic adaptation was normal. Photoaversion in RP may result because a small interference with contrast sensitivity or adaptation can place patients in a range of functional disability, or it may derive from a combination of minor aberrations.\r"

The amplitude of the PERG for each stimulus field and the ratio of them were analysed for 30 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Among these only a small number of eyes were detected as abnormal when we evaluated the amplitude itself either with the central stimulus or the paracentral ring stimulus, whereas the ratio of the two values was below normal in some cases of advanced glaucoma. We conclude that the ratio of the paracentral to central PERG is useful for detecting glaucoma.\r"

We found early enucleation to be associated with a better visual prognosis, possibly due to earlier diagnosis and faster, more aggressive therapy rather than a reduction in antigenic load. The clinical appearance of Dalen-Fuchs nodules appears to indicate a more severe stage of disease. Chlorambucil was useful in patients with severe disease. To be effective and to lessen its side effects chlorambucil was given in daily dosages that were increased weekly over a short period to achieve bone marrow suppression.

These findings were confirmed by spectrotypic analysis of sera from patients and controls where the predominant serum antibody response was polyclonal. In a small group of patients with retinal vasculitis there was an additional monoclonal response, indicating clonal expansion of a single lymphocyte subset. The prevalence of serum antibodies to retinal antigens in the normal population may indicate a protective role for 'natural' autoantibodies, as has recently been suggested for autoimmune diseases generally.\r"

The registration rates for Leicestershire when analysed by age, sex, and cause are shown to be broadly in line with available national figures.

LAP mRNA levels were determined in PMN from PNH and CML patients by RNA blotting analysis. In CML, LAP mRNA is undetectable, suggesting either decreased transcription or rapid degradation of the message. Contrarily, in PNH normal or high levels of LAP mRNA are present. This latter finding supports the concept of a deficit in the anchorage of the protein to the plasma membrane through the glycolipid pathway, even though other post-transcriptional mechanisms could be involved.\r"

Forty-one patients (72%) achieved complete remission (CR), including 11 of 12 patients who received the AMSA-containing regimen. The incidence of early fatal hemorrhage was 14%, lower than that of earlier studies or other published reports. Elevated WBC and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels at diagnosis were associated with an increased incidence of life-threatening hemorrhage and shorter remission duration. Advanced age was an unfavorable prognostic factor for male patients. Both DNR and AMSA in combination protocols are effective treatments for APL. The incidence of CR is similar to that achieved in other types of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) with the same protocols, but the median duration of remission is significantly longer in APL (24 v 9 months) and the percentage of remissions longer than 60 months is also higher in APL (35% v 5%).\r"

The present study demonstrates that, on in vivo inoculation, MPLV induces a rapid suppression of growth factor requirement for in vitro colony formation by both the late and the primitive erythroid progenitor cells. CFU-e-derived erythrocytic colonies developed and differentiated in semi-solid medium without the addition of erythropoietin (Epo). In addition, the formation of CFU-e colonies was not altered by the presence of specific neutralizing Epo antibodies. In the spleen, the CFU-e pool size increased rapidly up to 30-fold. By day 6 postinfection, 100% of these progenitor cells were Epo-independent. The in vivo effects of MPLV-infection on early erythroid progenitor cell compartments were examined in cultures grown for seven days. The concentration of erythroid progenitor cells was twofold elevated in spleen from MPLV-infected mice. As early as day 4 postinfection, 50% of these progenitors produced fully hemoglobinized colonies in serum-free cultures without the addition of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and Epo. Most spontaneous colonies were large and contained up to 10(5) cells per colony. They were composed of either erythroblasts only (16%) or erythroblasts and megakaryocytes (70%); few of them were multipotential (14%). In the marrow, the total number of BFU-e was reduced and only few factor-independent bursts were observed, suggesting a rapid migration of infected progenitors from marrow to spleen. Furthermore, the data show that abnormal erythropoiesis was due to the replication defective MPLV information and was not influenced by the Fv-2 locus.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between platelet density and platelet age appears to vary between species with relatively few labeling studies in humans reported. In this study, irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors were used to biochemically label the circulating platelet population in 15 humans. Platelet samples were then isolated during the 15 days after drug ingestion. The platelets were separated by density on continuous linear Percoll gradients and the density distributions were divided into five fractions containing approximately equal numbers of platelets. Baseline MAO activity was strongly correlated with platelet density. Twenty-four hours after a single dose of tranylcypromine, platelet MAO activities in the density subpopulations were reduced to 14% to 17% of the baseline values. During the first five days after inhibition, the rates of recovery of MAO activity (percentage per day) were inversely proportional to platelet density. The recovery rates in the two most dense fractions were initially slow but increased after five days. Percentage recovery of MAO activity in the least dense fraction was significantly greater than the percentage recovery in the most dense fraction on days 2, 3, 5, and 8 (P less than .01, sign test). These results support the hypothesis that normal human platelets show a small increase in density with age, but they do not exclude the additional possibility that human platelet lifespan is positively correlated with platelet density.\r"

Low amounts of the radiolabeled anti-Fg Fab bound to unstimulated or adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-stimulated cells. They readily bound to platelets stimulated with collagen, alpha-thrombin or gamma-thrombin in the presence of divalent cations. At 1 n mol/L alpha-thrombin or 25 nmol/L gamma-thrombin, platelet fibrinogen was expressed on the surface of the cells notwithstanding the presence of AP-2, a monoclonal antibody to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex, or the synthetic peptides Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and gamma 400-411, all substances that prevented the binding of plasma fibrinogen to platelets. These results suggest that platelet fibrinogen may interact with its receptors during its translocation from the alpha-granules to the plasma membrane and, thus, not occupy the same sites as those available for plasma fibrinogen on the surface of the cell. Furthermore, we found that platelet fibrinogen was expressed on the thrombin-stimulated platelets of a Glanzmann's thrombasthenia variant that failed to bind plasma fibrinogen. Normal platelets stimulated with 5 nmol/L alpha-thrombin bound increased amounts of the anti-fg Fab, the additional expression being inhibited by the anti-GP IIb-IIIa monoclonal antibody or by Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro, an inhibitor of fibrin polymer formation. This suggests that rebinding to externally located GP IIb-IIIa complexes becomes important once fibrin is formed.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial cells express surface molecules that are involved in cell-matrix interaction, including the vitronectin receptor and the fibronectin receptor, both members of a family of cell adhesion receptors (integrins). Here we provide evidence that endothelial cells express a membrane molecule, indistinguishable from the platelet VLA-2 complex, which is a collagen receptor and a member of the integrin family. To identify this endothelial molecule, we have used a monoclonal antibody, CLB-10G11, which recognizes the VLA-2 complex from platelets. The molecule recognized by CLB-10G11 from endothelial cells was characterized as follows. (1) The monoclonal antibody precipitated two proteins from surface-labeled endothelial cells that corresponded to the platelet VLA-2 subunits (glycoprotein Ia and IIa) as judged by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and two-dimensional nonreduced/reduced SDS-PAGE. (2) Preclearing of endothelial cells with monoclonal antibody A-1A5, an antibody that is directed against the common VLA beta subunit, removed all the CLB-10G11-binding material. (3) Crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed that CLB-10G11 recognizes a single precipitation arc from either platelets or endothelial cells. Analysis of these two cell types in one gel again revealed one precipitation arc. The antigen of either cell type, recognized by CLB-10G11 could be precipitated by either polyclonal antiplatelet or polyclonal antiendothelial cell antiserum. Hence, it appears that endothelial cells express at least three different surface molecules (the vitronectin receptor, the fibronectin receptor and a collagen receptor), which may play an important role in controlling the anchorage of endothelial cells to the extracellular matrix.\r"

This chromosome is the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. In CML the break on chromosome 22 occurs within the major breakpoint cluster region (Mbcr) of the bcr gene. In this study, we report on the examination of DNAs from nine Ph'-chromosome positive ALL patients for rearrangements within the bcr gene using Southern blot analysis. Of nine patients having a karyotypically identifiable Ph'-chromosome, only five exhibited rearrangements of the bcr gene. This could indicate that in ALL, chromosome 22 sequences other than the bcr gene are involved in the Ph'-translocation. Within the group of Ph'-positive ALL patients having a bcr gene breakpoint, a correlation appears to exist between the age of the patient and the location of the breakpoint within the gene: all or the vast majority of pediatric patients analyzed to date do not have a Mbcr breakpoint as found in CML and in adult ALL.\r"

The use of fast rare-earth film-screen systems permits exposures of most views of the patient within 1 s. The spatial resolution within these film-screen systems is 40-30 microns diameter at magnifications of x 5-10. The tube is fixed so as to project a horizontal beam and the patient table is designed to position the patient close to the source (20-30 cm) with the film placed at a focus-film distance of 1-3 m. Stereopair macroradiographs permit greater accuracy in the identification and location of radiographic features. The large magnification and resolution of macroradiographs allow direct and accurate measurement of radiographic features.\r"

The skin entrance dose was estimated from a knowledge of the technique factors, X-ray tube output and backscatter factors. Normalized organ dose data were employed to estimate the radiation dose to a number of critical organs. A number of methods of reducing the radiation dose to neonates were investigated. Initially, this involved changing the radiographic technique factors and introducing a lead rubber adjustable collimator, placed on top of the incubator, in addition to the light beam diaphragms on the X-ray tube. It was deduced from the results of calculations that these modifications to the radiographic examination technique had reduced the average entrance dose per radiograph from 92 mu Gy to 58 mu Gy, a reduction of 37%. Later, a rare-earth film-screen combination was introduced to replace the existing fast calcium tungstate screens. This enabled the average entrance dose per radiograph to be reduced to 39 mu Gy, a further reduction of 33%. The mean radiation dose to a neonate is mainly determined by the number of radiographs taken and this is dependent on the clinical symptoms.\r"

Comparison was made with rabbits treated with an identical dose of SR-2508 given intravenously prior to photon beam radiotherapy. Control animals were treated with radiation therapy only, intra-arterial SR-2508 only, or had no treatment. Neither the radiation therapy alone nor the SR-2508 alone had any effect on tumour growth. In the intra-arterial group, the tumour growth was slower and the size was significantly smaller than all other groups. The results suggest that the intra-arterial infusion of the radiation sensitizer produces greater response of the tumour than intravenous infusion when each is combined with radiation therapy.\r"

The Kodak TMatG-Lanex Medium system was better than the standard system for IVPs but not as good for bones. It gave virtually no speed advantage below 90 kV. Kodak T-grain film in a medium-speed, rare-earth screen was found to be better than the standard system for IVPs. Agfa T-grain film in a fast rare-earth screen was unsatisfactory for IVPs.

For calculation purposes there is a time after which an implant can no longer be considered effective in sterilizing tumour cells. This \"effective\" treatment time for a permanent implant can be approximately defined in terms of the radionuclide decay constant, the potential doubling time, the initial dose-rate and the value of alpha in the tumour alpha/beta ratio. The analytical technique has been applied to a specific intercomparison of commonly encountered implants using 125I and 198Au, and suggests that, even in the most favourable cases, the former radionuclide offers few radiobiological advantages. Although not specifically discussed here, the method can also be applied to the assessment of various forms of biologically targeted radiotherapy.\r"

This study highlights the significant pathogenic role of periventricular leucomalacia in cerebral palsy, since in 45% of the cases of this series this diagnosis had been reached as a result of a characteristic CT appearance associated with a history of premature birth and very specific clinical deficits. The CT abnormalities, mostly posterior and generally bilateral and symmetrical, affect the contours of the lateral ventricles, which become straight and angular, and often involve ventriculomegaly (85%). Localized juxtaventricular hypodensities were only found in a few cases (6%). The cognitive and intellectual sequelae in these children were more severe than in those children whose CT examination was normal, and were also more pronounced when the longitudinal fissure of the cerebrum was enlarged.\r"

Binding assays were conducted on samples of membrane homogenate taken from both the healthy portion and the tumour site of the kidney. It was found that binding characteristics of benign tumours and normal kidney tissues were not significantly different, i.e. equilibrium dissociation constants of 2.20 +/- 0.73 and 2.38 +/- 0.98 nM, respectively, and maximal number of binding sites of 3190 +/- 1081 and 4189 +/- 998 fmol/mg protein, respectively. In contrast, no PBS were detectable in renal carcinoma. The absence of PBS in malignant renal tissues may serve as a biochemical marker for tumours of the kidney.\r"

We observed 3 complete and 2 partial unexplained spontaneous regressions and a further 4 patients had prolonged stable disease for more than 12 months. A group of 21 patients on progression subsequently received treatment with alpha-interferon (Wellferon) as part of a multicentre study which included an additional 61 cases; 12 responded (3 surveillance relapse patients and 9 others). Patients with lung metastases only had the highest response rate (10/17 compared with 5 unexplained responses seen in 38 such patients on surveillance). These results confirm that alpha-interferon is active against metastatic renal carcinoma and that the responses are not totally explicable by spontaneous regression.\r"

Surgery was performed by trainee urologists in 35 cases (46%). The overall complication rate was 46%, of which 17% were per-operative and did not influence the outcome of surgery. Infection occurred in 16% and necessitated removal of the suture buffers in 9%. Follow-up ranged from 7 to 30 months (mean 18.3). Complete resolution of stress incontinence or a marked improvement in symptoms was seen in 86% of cases. Patients with no history of previous pelvic surgery were all either cured or improved by the procedure. Of the 52 patients who had undergone previous pelvic surgery, 42 (80%) were either cured or improved. All of the 10 failures were in this group. There was no difference between complication or success rates achieved by consultants or urologists in training. It was concluded that EBNS is the treatment of choice in patients with primary stress incontinence and it is an effective procedure in patients who have undergone previous unsuccessful surgery for stress incontinence.\r"

Despite improved understanding of the biochemistry and techniques of detection of BGA, these results preclude the use of BGA determination as a guide to prognosis in individual transitional cell carcinoma, whether used alone or in combination with pT category.\r"

A retrospective survey of 170 patients treated during this period showed an overall age-corrected 5-year survival rate of 49%. The survival of patients in whom referral for radiotherapy had been delayed was 37% compared with 56% for those given immediate treatment. Patients with poorly differentiated tumours had a significantly reduced survival compared with those with well differentiated tumours. The overall complication rate from radiotherapy was 4% and this low rate is attributed to the small volume used uniformly for treatment.\r"

Along with each 24-h sample, 10-ml aliquots of urine were obtained at 3 designated times during the day for both ward dipstick testing and laboratory assay; + or more on the dipstick correlated with abnormal proteinuria (greater than or equal to 150 mg/24 h) in 88% of cases, whilst trace values straddled the level of significant proteinuria. Further differentiation of trace was possible by repeat testing during the day. The subsequent presence of a dipstick negative during that day correlated with normality in all but 5% of cases. In order to ensure detection of renal disease presenting as isolated orthostatic proteinuria, assay of the mid-morning sample is recommended.\r"

Surgery was performed between the ages of 2 and 8 because of either repeated breakthrough infection or persistence of grade III or IV reflux. Height and weight velocities were calculated as yearly rates and then converted into interquartile ratios (IQRs). Neither the mean centile height nor weight attained varied significantly between that at entry, after 1 year of medical treatment and at 2 years after surgery. However, the mean IQR for height velocity (+/- sem) rose significantly from -0.61 (+/- 0.45) during antimicrobial prophylaxis to 0.54 (+/- 0.25) following surgery. Similarly, the mean IQR for weight velocity rose significantly from -0.63 (+/- 0.50) during medical treatment to 0.47 (+/- 0.24) following surgery. These results suggest that surgical treatment is preferable to continued medical treatment in patients with severe primary vesicoureteric reflux who fail to respond to a trial of antimicrobial prophylaxis.\r"

This coincided with a mononuclear cell infiltrate in the bladder wall consisting predominantly of activated helper T lymphocytes. Smaller numbers of macrophages, suppressor cytotoxic T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes were also found. These new findings confirm that the inflammatory response to BCG involves the urothelium in an immunological reaction and suggest that the success of immunotherapy with intravesical BCG may be due to enhanced tumour antigen recognition.\r"

In the second study a tubularised partial-thickness pedicle graft was invaginated through an oblique tunnel in the bladder wall, with the graft extending extravesically and then being wrapped in omentum. This technique provided complete urothelial covering by 2 weeks with much less periluminal fibrosis.

Bonney's blue is composed of a 1:1 mixture of brilliant green and crystal violet dissolved in ethanol (90%) or industrial methylated spirit. Before insertion into the bladder this solution must be diluted with water to a 0.5% solution. Failure to do this will result in a severe inflammatory reaction within the bladder. The degree of resultant damage depends upon the duration of exposure. Persistent pain is a feature of this condition, although the other symptoms (frequency and urgency) may settle in time. Two cases of chemical cystitis resulting from the use of undiluted Bonney's blue are described to illustrate the possible consequences. Both patients were awarded 6-figure sums as compensation.\r"

Cromakalim abolished spontaneous activity in all strips but did not abolish the ability of the detrusor muscle from any of the specimens studied to respond to carbachol, increased extracellular K+ or transmural nerve stimulation. Intravenous infusion of cromakalim in the urethral obstructed mini-pig caused the characteristic unstable contractions associated with bladder outflow obstruction to be abolished, leaving the animal able to void. Experiments with potassium isotopes and the sucrose gap technique demonstrated that cromakalim increased the potassium permeability and hyperpolarised the cell membrane, consistent with its reported actions on other smooth muscles. These results suggest that drugs such as cromakalim, which act by reducing membrane excitability without inhibiting responses to existing innervation, may have a clinical application in the treatment of instability which is secondary to bladder outflow obstruction.\r"

The salivary testosterone values in these patients were significantly lower than in normal males but not significantly different from those in normal females. The salivary testosterone concentrations were measured for 6 consecutive months and did not vary significantly from month to month. The results suggest that the measurement of salivary testosterone concentrations could be useful in evaluating the androgenic function of patients with prostatic carcinoma after medical or surgical orchiectomy.\r"

This can be achieved by surgical means, usually bilateral orchiectomy, or medically, by a number of drugs. One advantage of surgical over medical castration is that it is a once-only procedure. Another factor, which could be considered a major advantage, is the low cost of the surgical procedure. This report outlines the costs involved in treating prostatic carcinoma by surgical castration and compares them with the costs of some forms of medical treatment.\r"

The 30-day mortality rate was 3.8 per cent and none of these deaths was due to anastomotic leakage. In hospital, mortality was 7.5 per cent. Six patients (3.8 per cent) had evidence of a leak. In four patients this was from the suture line, but in the remaining two it was due to patches of gangrene in the fundus of the transposed stomach and was separate from the anastomosis. Two patients died with an unhealed leak. Anastomotic leaks were minor in three instances and healed with conservative treatment but the fourth required exploration. Gangrene of the oesophageal substitute resulted in gross leakage with mediastinitis and required exploration in both cases. An apparent predisposing cause was evident in five of the six cases with leakage and some of these might have been avoidable. Transthoracic oesophagectomy can be performed with acceptably low mortality and leak rates and may therefore be considered as the treatment of choice for most patients with oesophageal cancer.\r"

During this period, the general frequency of cardia carcinoma increased continuously from 6.6 per cent (1969-71) to 37.5 per cent (1984-85) and a corresponding decrease of carcinomas in other sites was observed. Early carcinomas (pT1) of the oesophageal margin (n = 10, 2.4 per cent) were diagnosed less often than early carcinomas in other sites (n = 177, 18.9 per cent). Whereas 51.4 per cent of all resected carcinomas of the stomach showed no lymph node metastases (pN0), only 14.1 per cent of cardia carcinomas belonged to this category. With respect to operative treatment, Lauren's classification which defines the required margin of clearance according to diffuse type (frequency in cardia carcinoma 43 per cent, in other stomach sites 51 per cent), is of great significance. We believe that extensive oesophageal resection is necessary for patients with such difficult tumours. The pattern of metastasis in cardia carcinoma is similar to that of cancer in other stomach sites, the preferred area is the regional lymph nodes on the lesser curve (83 per cent). Histological classification and metastasis pattern show that cardia carcinoma is a type of carcinoma of the stomach which must be treated according to the criteria of stomach cancer surgery.\r"

Ten patients with symptoms and signs of dumping were studied. After a dumping provocation test with placebo, all patients developed severe symptoms: seven patients had early dumping, two had both early and late dumping and one had late dumping alone. With either 50 or 100 micrograms SMS 201-995, the symptoms of early dumping were much reduced in all patients, and those of late dumping were completely abolished. The packed cell volume, pulse and systolic blood pressure changes of early dumping were significantly reduced by SMS 201-995 and the fall in blood glucose in patients with late dumping was abolished. SMS 201-995 may be a useful treatment for early and late dumping.\r"

Age, sex, size of stoma, anastomotic technique, albumin and experience of the operator were not significant factors. Gastroenterostomy in the presence of 'gastric atony' was likely to produce DRGE. In all, 86 per cent of cases resolved spontaneously. Only one case of DRGE was found to have a mechanical cause.

Kinetic measurements of protein and glucose metabolism were made before resection and at home 10 weeks after surgery. During convalescence there were major changes in both groups in glucose metabolism and the hormonal milieu despite no alterations in protein kinetics or metabolic rate. In particular, the rate of glucose production doubled from (mean +/- s.e.m.) 14.8 +/- 1.3 to 28.1 +/- 2.5 mumol kg-1 min-1 (P less than 0.01), the percentage of available glucose undergoing oxidation decreased from 35.5 +/- 3.9 to 21.5 +/- 2.9 per cent (P less than 0.05) and the percentage of glucose undergoing recycling to lactate increased from 20.1 +/- 10.0 to 52.9 +/- 2.3 per cent (P less than 0.05). During convalescence the basal plasma insulin concentration was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) and there was a proportionately smaller response to glucose infusion. The convalescent state was also associated with an elevation in serum cortisol from 291 +/- 54 to 496 +/- 75 nmol litre-1 (P less than 0.05). The values for resting energy expenditure were not significantly different from the predicted energy expenditure in either the preoperative or the convalescent groups. We conclude that (a) there is a marked increase in both glucose production and glucose recycling to lactate in convalescence from clean uncomplicated surgery, and this is associated with a decrease in the percentage of glucose uptake oxidised; (b) a relative hyperinsulinaemia is seen in convalescent patients and is associated with decreased responsiveness to a glucose load; (c) the plasma cortisol level is significantly elevated after 10 weeks of convalescence; and (d) convalescent patients do not have elevated rates of protein catabolism or energy expenditure.\r"

Fibronectin may be an important opsonin of the RE system and low fibronectin levels often accompany severe sepsis in man. We have investigated the effect of prolonged intra-abdominal sepsis on plasma fibronectin concentrations and RE function. Serial plasma fibronectin concentrations were determined in rabbits for 2 weeks after either the induction of sepsis (appendix abscess) (n = 6) or laparotomy only (n = 6). RE function was measured at 2 weeks by determining the clearance kinetics and organ distribution of low dose technetium tin colloid (TTC). There was an early transient depression in plasma fibronectin values followed by elevated concentrations at 48-72 h which were more marked in the sepsis group. There was a delay in the blood clearance with reduced hepatic and increased bone uptake of TTC. We conclude that depletion of opsonic fibronectin is unlikely to be an important factor contributing to the impairment of RE function associated with intra-abdominal sepsis and that RE depression in septic animals is due to intrinsic Kupffer cell dysfunction.\r"

Blood samples taken preoperatively and on days 1-5 after operation were analysed for C-reactive protein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, albumin, prealbumin and transferrin. There was no significant difference in any of the preoperative protein concentrations between the two groups although undernourished patients tended to have lower transferrin concentrations (mean +/- s.e.m., 2.2 +/- 0.3 g/l) than the control group (2.9 +/- 0.1 g/l). C-reactive protein response was significantly smaller in the undernourished group than in the control group (P = 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). The responses of the other acute phase proteins did not differ between the two groups. There was no difference in the length of hospital stay after operation when undernourished patients (mean +/- s.e.m., 17.7 +/- 3.0 days) were compared with controls (14.3 +/- 3.6 days). Undernourished patients therefore have an attenuated C-reactive protein response to elective surgery. The significance of this in relation to morbidity and mortality in severely ill patients requires further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was carried out in 428 subjects (212 controls and 216 patients) to evaluate the delayed cell-mediated immune response preoperatively in patients with biliary lithiasis. The delayed hypersensitivity response was assessed by a Multitest and subjects were classified as immunocompetent, relatively anergic or anergic. Significant differences were found between control subjects and patients with cholelithiasis compared with those with acute cholecystitis (P less than 0.01), non-icteric choledocholithiasis (P less than 0.01) and choledocholithiasis with jaundice (P less than 0.05). There were also differences between patients with icteric and non-icteric choledocholithiasis (P less than 0.02). Seven possible causative factors for anergy were evaluated: a haemoglobin concentration of less than or equal to 12 g/l and a haematocrit of less than or equal to 35 per cent were related to the appearance of anergy and relative anergy in patients with acute cholecystitis. Bilirubin levels greater than or equal to 34 mumol/l were found in 60 per cent of patients with choledocholithiasis and relative anergy and in 80 per cent of those who were anergic (P less than 0.001). These results show a high incidence of failure of the cell-mediated immune response in patients with acute cholecystitis (71 per cent) and icteric choledocholithiasis (82 per cent). In the latter, jaundice appears to be associated with this failure. A close correlation between relatively anergic and anergic state and the development of postoperative septic complications was found.\r"

The late results appear better than reported results for conventional Whipple resection and the delay in early recovery does not appear to have any late sequelae, provided that it does not require gastric bypass for relief.\r"

  ".W": "A detailed prospective study of 58 consecutive breast cancer patients and contemporaneous controls, using age, duration of tumour and presence or absence of poor prognostic signs as clinical parameters, clearly showed that the patients fell into three distinct groups. Group A accounted for 30 per cent of cancers and consisted of young women (21-45 years) with advanced cancers, a short history (3 months or less) and poor prognostic signs; these patients had fast-growing tumours. Group B, to which nearly 60 per cent of patients belonged, was made up of menopausal women (46-50 years) with advanced disease, a history of from 3 months to 1 year and poor prognostic signs; their tumour growth rate was intermediate. Group C made up slightly more than 10 per cent of cases and consisted of postmenopausal women (50 years and above) who gave a long history (1 year or more), and had resectable tumours without poor prognostic signs. Thus, although advanced breast cancer in tropical Africa is due to late presentation in the majority of cases, a small but significant proportion of women have advanced disease in spite of early presentation, attributable to fast tumour growth rate.\r"

In one group of ten patients seen before 1977, simple histological examination revealed a 9 per cent incidence of residual tumour. However, after thorough examination residual foci of DCIS were found in 77 per cent of a subsequent group of 30 patients. This means that the majority of patients would have had to undergo reoperation if a breast-saving procedure had been performed. This fact must be taken into account when planning treatment of patients with non-palpable DCIS.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluates the usefulness of routine follow-up of breast cancer patients. In all, 416 patients who were treated with curative intent for breast cancer were followed according to a fixed follow-up schedule for a minimum of 2.5 years and a maximum of 13.5 years (mean about 5 years). During the 4533 routine out-patient visits, 4116 chest radiographs, 3889 pelvic radiographs and about 17,000 laboratory tests were carried out routinely. In the follow-up period, 148 patients were found to have distant recurrence of whom 34 (23 per cent) had asymptomatic metastases and 114 symptomatic metastases. Of the 8005 routinely performed radiographs, 24 (0.3 per cent) revealed asymptomatic metastases, and the 17,000 laboratory tests led to the discovery of six asymptomatic bone and four asymptomatic liver recurrences. Screening for metastases did not result in a reduction of the lead time to the diagnosis of asymptomatic metastases; the disease-free interval was equal in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Of the 46 locoregional recurrences 42 were found by physical examination during a routine follow-up visit and 37 had not been noticed by the patient. Seventeen second primary breast cancers were diagnosed, six of which were in stage I (less than 2 cm). Mammography was not a part of the routine follow-up scheme. It is concluded that routine follow-up of breast cancer patients by history and physical examination is sufficient to detect local recurrence and a second primary tumour as well as giving the opportunity to track signs and symptoms of distant recurrence at an early stage. Performing annual or biannual mammography is advisable, but the use of other costly routine investigations in the follow-up is not justifiable, as no therapeutic advantages can be expected.\r"

The procedures used to identify these patients and minimize the risk of infection of hospital staff in the operating department are described. All staff working in the operating department were surveyed to determine their caseload, feelings of anxiety, and the incidence of high-risk exposure to infection. Anxiety was not related to workload, but was more common in those who had high-risk exposure. All members of staff who sustained a needlestick injury were tested for HIV antibodies at intervals after injury; 33 also volunteered to be tested in a screening session 3 months after the study period. None had HIV antibodies, suggesting that the risk of acquiring HIV infection in the operating department is low.\r"

We studied 127 human spleens using anatomical dissection and a sequential injection method involving both radiology and corrosion casting, with the primary aim of examining segmental splenic anatomy and blood supply. The existence of well-defined splenic segments was confirmed and these ranged in number from 3 to 7 with a mean of 4.3. Each segment had its own arterial supply and venous drainage. The segments were separated from each other by avascular planes. Subsegments with independent blood supply were also identified. The splenic artery was found to divide into two branches; in all cases these further divided into segmental arteries supplying the central segments of the spleen. The polar segments were supplied by segmental vessels of highly variable origin and size. This study aims to highlight the importance of identifying these segmental vessels at operation when splenic conservation is considered.\r"

Eight of these patients were treated surgically, and four died. Group II consisted of seven patients with features of localized peritonitis and all were treated conservatively. In all cases the diagnosis of liver abscess was established by liver scan or ultrasound examination; peritonitis was established either at operation or, in the conservatively managed group, by aspiration of pus from the peritoneal cavity. Amoebiasis was diagnosed by serology. Eight group I and all group II patients were managed conservatively by aspiration of the liver abscess, antibiotics and amoebicides. There were no deaths in this group. It is suggested that, if the diagnosis can be made early, conservative treatment offers the best chance of cure for patients of amoebic liver abscess with intraperitoneal rupture.\r"

In the group characterized by long dressing time, the rate of postoperative wound infections was 4.9 per cent. The rate was 4.7 per cent in the group represented by short dressing time. Using short dressing time not only reduces the number of nursing hours but also limits the need for costly dressing material. In addition, both wound observation and patients' personal hygiene are made easier.\r"

With the use of billing files prepared by the British Columbia Medical Association a group of 65 family practice certificants in active practice in British Columbia was compared with a control group of 130 internship trainees matched by year and school of graduation, category of billing (i.e., solo or group) and region. A wide range of practice features was assessed for the fiscal years 1984-85, 1985-86 and 1986-87. No differences were detected between the groups in 1986-87 for the following practice variables: number of patients (1888 and 1842 respectively), number of personal services billed for (7265 and 7173), number of personal services per patient (3.9), amount of funding for personal services ($140,192 and $140,100) and amount per patient for personal services ($77 and $79). Age-adjusted costs for male and female patients were similar in the two groups. Of six services thought to be influenced by type of training, only maternity care generated a significantly higher number of billings in the study group (341 v. 249). These results suggest that there is no demonstrable effect of training on patterns of practice. However, the question of the effect of training on quality of care and whether the 2-year residency may have a longer effect on practice patterns should be the focus of future research.\r"

Radioallergosorbent testing for IgE antibodies to penicillin yielded negative results, and lymphocyte transformation testing gave a positive result in only one patient.

  ".W": "Mammary recurrences were studied in 1593 patients with Stage I and II breast cancer treated by macroscopically complete tumor excision followed by megavoltage radiotherapy, including a boost to the tumor bed (mean dose, 78 Gy). The actuarial freedom from mammary recurrence was 93% at 5, 86% at 10, 82% at 15, and 80% at 20 years. Seventy-nine percent of the recurrences were in the vicinity of the tumor bed, but with increasing time interval, an increasing percentage of recurrences was located elsewhere in the breast. A majority of recurrences after 10 years could be considered new tumors. Only ten of 181 patients with recurrence had prior or concomitant distant metastases, and 159 of 171 isolated mammary recurrences (93%) were operable. Uncorrected overall survival after operable recurrence was 69% at 5 and 57% at 10 years. Prognosis after late recurrence (after 5 years) was favorable (84% 5-year survival). Operable early recurrences retained a favorable prognosis if smaller than 2 cm and confined to the breast (74% 5-year survival). Disease-free interval and histologic grade also appeared to be important prognostic factors after early recurrence. Survival after recurrence did not depend upon the type of salvage operation. Locoregional control was 88% at 5 years after salvage mastectomy and 64% after breast-conserving salvage procedures. The role of adjuvant systemic therapy at time of local recurrence requires additional study. This experience illustrates the important differences between mammary failure and chest wall recurrence after mastectomy, in particular the protracted time course and more favorable prognosis associated with the former.\r"

A reinduction was performed in part of the responding patients at time of early relapse (1 g MPA IM for 10 consecutive days). MPA serum levels above 100 ng/ml were achieved during induction treatment and maintained for 3 to 4 months during the oral phase of therapy before decreasing to approximately 50 ng/ml. Two complete remissions (duration, 17.2 and 62 months), 15 partial remissions (median duration, 7 months), and 21 cases of disease stabilization (median duration, 5.5 months) were achieved. The median survival time was significantly longer for responders (19.9 months) than nonresponders (4.8 months). Although a higher proportion of postmenopausal patients responded, the remission duration in premenopausal women was remarkably long. Favorable sites of response were soft tissue, lymph nodes, and bone lesions. Reinduction treatment yielded a second response (two partial remissions, three no change) in five of six patients indicating that high-dose conditions were necessary to maintain response. This schedule allows to restrict higher doses of MPA on a long-term basis to responding patients.\r"

The authors recently observed striking mitotic arrest associated with epithelial necrosis and ulceration in an esophageal biopsy specimen. The biopsy specimen was taken from a patient who received taxol the day before endoscopy. Review of our autopsy files revealed four other cases in which taxol had been administered. Sections of esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, skin, bone marrow, and testes were examined for evidence of mitotic arrest. Mitotic arrest was seen in the two patients who underwent autopsy who received taxol less than 11 days before death, whereas the two autopsy patients who received taxol more than 2 weeks before death did not show these changes. Although mitotic arrest was most prominent in the esophagus, it was also found in the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, and bone marrow. The mitotic arrest was associated with bundling of intermediate filaments and appeared to be secondary to accumulation of polymerized microtubules. These results suggest that taxol induces a transient mitotic arrest associated with cell necrosis.\r"

DNA ploidy patterns were grouped into low and high ploidies, according to the degree of dispersion and the peak value on the DNA histogram. In the low ploidy group, there were no significant differences in the prognosis and histologic effects between the HCR and CR therapies. In the high ploidy group, however, the difference in survival curves was statistically significant, the 3-year survival rates of patients given HCR therapy and CR therapy being 26.7% and 10.7%, respectively (P less than 0.05). The HCR therapy increased the rate of \"markedly effective\" in the resected tissue compared with findings in cases of CR therapy. These findings show the positive effects of the HCR therapy for carcinoma of the esophagus, especially for patients with an aneuploid profile and a poor prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "A breast biopsy was performed in 19 patients for the finding of new mammographic calcifications without an associated palpable or mammographic mass after breast-conserving surgery and definitive irradiation for early stage breast cancer. The interval postradiotherapy was 9 to 96 months with a median of 34 months. Eleven of the biopsy specimens (58%) were positive for recurrent breast cancer and eight (42%) were negative. The pathologic results from the positive biopsy specimens showed four with invasive ductal carcinoma, two with microinvasive ductal carcinoma, four with intraductal carcinoma, and one with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Treatment consisted of mastectomy in eight patients, mastectomy plus chemotherapy in one patient, and biopsy for the patient with LCIS. One patient refused a recommended mastectomy. All 11 patients with recurrent carcinoma are alive with no evidence of disease after salvage therapy, although follow-up is short (median, 14 months; range, 0-48 months). Calcifications which developed in a quadrant different from the initial tumor tended to be malignant with four of five having a positive biopsy result. Microcalcifications were not commonly associated with the initial tumor with only five of 19 having microcalcifications. These results show that the development of new calcifications in the postirradiated breast is associated with a positive biopsy rate of 58% and that the tumors which are found tend to be early and potentially salvageable. The positive biopsy rate of 58% in the postirradiated breast is in marked contrast to the lower positive biopsy rate for microcalcifications in the nonirradiated breast as reported in the literature.\r"

Two illustrative case reports of this pathologic entity are presented. Six autopsy cases with this entity including the two cases were reviewed neurologically, radiographically, and histopathologically. All patients presented progressive disturbances of mental status and consciousness, akinesia, and tremor-like involuntary movement. Computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated marked enlargement of the ventricles, moderate widening of the cortical sulci, and a moderately attenuated CT number for the white matter in all six patients. Four of the six patients had CSF drainage (ventriculoperitoneal shunt or continuous lumbar drainage), however, none of them improved. Histologic examination demonstrated swelling and loss of the myelin sheath in the white matter in all patients, and reactive astrocytosis in three of the six patients. Neither prominent neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex or basal ganglia, nor axonal loss in the white matter was generally identified. The blood vessels of the cerebral cortex and white matter were normal. Ependymal layer and the surrounding brain tissue were normal in all patients. These findings suggested that this pathologic condition results from demyelination secondary to direct neurotoxic effect of irradiation. The authors' previous report was reviewed and the differential diagnoses, the risk factors for this pathologic entity, and the indication for radiation therapy in aged patients with a malignant brain tumor are discussed.\r"

Although the enhanced NK cell activity and LDCC were closely associated with high levels (greater than 31 fmol/mg) of estrogen receptor (ER) content in the primary tumor, no other clinical or histologic correlation between the increase in either parameter of cytotoxic effector cell function could be found. Thus, ER levels greater than 31 fmol/mg might be associated with increased cytotoxic effector cell function in tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer.\r"

Serial in vitro immune function studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were done to determine parameters of B-cell and T-cell functions as well as natural killer (NK)-cell activity. The authors detected profound suppression of in vitro immunoglobulin synthesis and lymphocyte proliferation as well as depression of NK-cell activity during IFN treatment. All suppressed immune functions normalized on discontinuation of IFN therapy. The authors conclude from these observations that, apart from their beneficial effects, IFN produce substantial immunosuppression.\r"

  ".W": "To study the progression of astrocytic neoplasms and to provide practical information about the topography of the glioblastoma multiforme, the distribution of eight defined cell types was mapped from whole brain sections of 18 glioblastomas studied postmortem. Based on the densities and topographic distributions of well-differentiated and anaplastic cells, three principal categories of neoplasms were defined. In one group of three cases, multifocal glioblastomas appeared to be emerging in the background of a better differentiated, and presumably precursory, astrocytic neoplasm. In another group of nine cases, the neoplasms were more intimate mixtures of well and poorly differentiated cells. The third group of five cases was composed of neoplasms that were largely undifferentiated without a component of better differentiated cells. The study suggests that progression from a better differentiated neoplasm to one composed largely of undifferentiated cells is common in the fibrillary astrocytic neoplasms. Although some glioblastomas appear largely undifferentiated and consistent with the de novo appearance of overt malignancy, the size of these neoplasms and the patterns of necrosis leave open the possibility that a preexisting better differentiated neoplasm had been obliterated by necrosis and the overgrowth of the anaplastic component. The potential topographic variation of cellular constituency in a glioblastoma underscores the care that must be exercised in utilization of the needle biopsy technique in the diagnosis and grading of astrocytic neoplasms.\r"

The clinical usefulness of these tumor markers to diagnose and monitor distant metastases was compared with that of the imaging techniques commonly used to monitor breast cancer patients (bone scanning [BS], liver echography [LE], chest radiograph, and skeletal radiograph). So far, 23 patients withdrew from the study, and distant metastases occurred in 33 patients. In 91% of the metastatic patients, constant elevation or progressive increase in serum CEA and/or TPA levels were the first pathologic findings of the relapse. Of the remaining 168 nonrelapsed patients, 122 were followed up longer than 24 months (43 +/- 17 months; mean +/- SD). In these 122 patients the false-positive results of CEA, TPA, and OHP were 0.8%, 2.4%, and 0%, respectively, when used simultaneously with clinical examination and the common laboratory examinations. BS and LE are the only imaging techniques that showed such a high sensitivity to be suitable in the postoperative follow-up of breast cancer patients. Nevertheless, because BS has a low specificity and is not harmless, it should be performed at longer intervals than tumor markers. Eventually, in the relapsed patients, TPA and OHP well reflected the response to treatment better than CEA and prevented useless radiologic examinations.\r"

Seven cases are analyzed and evaluated for the presentation and natural history of this highly malignant lesion when it arises in a tumor that was previously an osteochondroma. Both peripheral and central dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas are high-grade malignant lesions and require wide or radical surgical margins for adequate treatment. Despite adequate resection, survival is poor; five of the seven cases presented herein died of metastatic spread of their disease. These cases of the peripheral variant of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma occurred in patients who were younger than patients with central dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas and may be present with longer duration of symptoms because they occur in previously long-standing benign osteochondromas. As such, they may be easily overlooked clinically and radiographically. Therefore, careful histologic analysis of all cartilage lesions arising on the surface of bone is essential to prevent overlooking foci of high-grade sarcomatous dedifferentiation.\r"

Therefore, a retrospective review was conducted of 173 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia to detect a possible influence of cigarette smoking on initial characteristics at the time of presentation and on the course of this disease. Thirty-nine patients (23%) were smoking 5 cigarettes/d or more at time of diagnosis. Cigarette smoking was significantly related to male sex (P = 0.0005) and younger age at diagnosis (P = 0.02) and smokers tended to have lower leukocyte counts (P = 0.07) than nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking was significantly associated with early blast crisis (P less than 0.0001) and short survival (P less than 0.0001). Other characteristics associated with a poor prognosis included hepatomegaly, anemia, and a high percentage of peripheral blast cells at time of diagnosis. When studied in a multivariate analysis, cigarette smoking remained the strongest prognostic factor for both occurrence of blast crisis (P = 0.0003) and overall survival (P = 0.0001). Other poor prognosis factors found in the multivariate analysis included a high percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood at time of diagnosis and high platelet count. It is possible that cigarette smoke may act as a promoter or cocarcinogen in the transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "In a retrospective study, which comprised the whole Dutch childhood population of approximately 3 million children, the authors assessed the influence of an isolated meningeal relapse, occurring as first relapse, together with some patient and treatment characteristics on prognosis in 142 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Until their first relapse, patients were initially treated according to standard protocols, whereas the treatment for relapse was heterogeneous. Concerning the probability of achieving a second complete remission (CR) it appears that the duration of the first CR is the single most important prognostic factor. The duration of the first CR is also the most important factor with regard to the duration of the second CR, upon which also age and sex have a significant influence. Concerning the survival from the time of central nervous system (CNS) relapse, again the duration of the first CR appears to be the most important prognostic factor, followed by age and the institution of systemic reinduction treatment. Other factors, such as initial leukocyte count, attainment of first CR within 48 days, type of reinduction treatment, and the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) blast count at the time of relapse, have a less important, but nevertheless significant influence on survival. The median survival from the time of CNS relapse is 25 months, the 5-year survival is 25%, whereas the ultimate survival will be less than 20%. From 90 patients who developed second or subsequent relapses, 75% experienced a bone marrow relapse during the follow-up period. From this study the authors conclude that CNS relapse in children with ALL carries a grave prognosis, which requires the institution of intensive retreatment programs.\r"

Other reports have claimed that this is a relative increase or represents referral center bias. The current study was designed to determine if the incidence of primary gastric lymphoma has increased in the community hospital setting. A total of 147 cases of gastric neoplasms were reviewed over a 10-year study period. The cases were divided into two 5-year periods, i.e., 1978-82 and 1983-87. There were two new cases (2.8%) of primary gastric lymphoma in the period 1978-82 and 11 new cases (19%) in the period 1983-87. The difference in proportion of primary gastric lymphoma between these two time periods was statistically significant (P = 0.01 by chi-square analysis). This increased incidence of primary gastric lymphoma is difficult to explain, but it must be recognized by surgeons and endoscopists.\r"

No serious or prolonged side effects were encountered except for vesicovaginal fistula in three patients and renal failure in one. The median duration of survival was 299 days, and the 1-year cumulative survival rate was 32.5%. The factors that were associated with favorable outcome after TAE were good general condition, no distant metastases, tumors less than 5 cm in diameter, and responses to the therapy of PR or better. Thus, TAE appears useful for the treatment of recurrent and advanced gynecologic malignancies.\r"

In 36 patients, the dose level was 1000 mg/day; 76 patients received a dose level of 500 mg/day. Patients with brain or liver metastasis were excluded, as were patients with tumors determined to be negative for estrogen receptors. Objective regression was observed in 35 (31%) patients, with the duration of response ranging from 4 to 36 + months (mean, 12 months; median, 10 months). Response was observed in 11 of 31 (35%) patients with soft tissue metastasis; 16/59 (27%) patients with osseous metastasis; and 8 of 22 (36%) having visceral metastasis. In 93 patients with positive estrogen receptor (ER), 33 responded (35%), whereas in 19 patients with unknown ER status, two responded (11%). Response to previous treatment with tamoxifen (TAM) had occurred in 31 patients; of these, response to AG was noted in 11 (35%). Of 24 patients failing to respond to prior treatment with tamoxifen, four (17%) responded to subsequent therapy with AG. Thirteen patients had previously received combination chemotherapy, and response to AG was noted in two (15%). The side effects observed in this study included skin rash in ten patients, fever in eight, somnolence in three, weakness and dizziness in one, headache in one, insomnia in one, dyspnea in one, and ataxia in one. Treatment had to be discontinued in eight patients, due to the severity of the side effects. As expected, patients receiving AG at the lower dose level of 500 mg/day experienced fewer and less severe side effects than those treated with the higher dose. The response rate in the 1000 mg/day group was 10/36 (28%) and in the 500 mg/day group, it was 25/76 (33%). The lower dosage was better tolerated without apparent compromise in therapeutic efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "Tumors of the hypothalamus present with a variety of clinical syndromes. Such syndromes appear to be both age and histology dependent. The diencephalic syndrome, an entity classically seen in infancy, presents as failure to thrive. In essentially all cases the pathologic substrate is a tumor with a predominance of gliomas. The traditional approach to treatment of the diencephalic syndrome has been surgery both for decompression and pathologic diagnosis followed by irradiation. Because of the tumor location, surgery is often confined to biopsy rather than radical extirpation. Furthermore, in infancy focal brain irradiation is not without significant morbidity. Within this context, we would like to present a case discussion regarding a 27-month-old boy with a hypothalamic-midbrain protoplasmic glioma treated with primary chemotherapy after surgical biopsy and pathologic documentation. The schedule of drugs utilized was based on the hypothesis of biochemical modulation of nitrosourea chemotherapy. Successful response to therapy was documented by sequential computed tomography (CT) studies and serial neurologic examinations beginning at age 5 months and every 2 months thereafter. The response of a single patient with the diencephalic syndrome treated primarily with chemotherapy makes extrapolation premature. Rather, the authors suggest chemotherapy as an alternative to focal brain irradiation. Such therapy could be utilized either in the event of recurrent tumor or as late consolidation after primary treatment with chemotherapy. The latter approach would allow a patient to have radiation therapy deferred until a later age at which time morbidity attending brain irradiation may be minimized.\r"

  ".U": "89195017\r", 
  ".W": "Mammary carcinomas have been induced by 3.5 Gy whole-body gamma radiation administered at age 40 to 50 days to virgin female Sprague-Dawley rats. In 142 irradiated controls carcinoma incidence averaged 7.8% in survivors observed less than 300 days and 38.3% of those surviving longer (P less than 0.001 by t test). Mammary cancer promotion was inhibited by two methods: estriol (E3) 638 micrograms/month (2.2 microns/mo) subcutaneously for natural life span begun 2 weeks after exposure reduced cancer incidence from 76% in controls to 48% after 331 to 449 mean days observation until neoplasia was palpable (P less than 0.02 by chi-square analysis). Uterine weights were similar in control and treated groups, and were 15% to 18% greater than uteri of nonirradiated controls from other simultaneous experiments. Six monthly 638-micrograms doses of 17 alpha ethinyl estriol (EE3) reduced tumors from 88% in controls to 64% (P less than 0.05 by chi-square analysis) and delayed cancer onset (P less than 0.01-0.04 by life table analysis). Ethinyl estradiol (EE2) after 6 months' treatment similarly delayed mammary tumor development reducing incidence to 75% (NS), with a six-fold increase in nonmammary epithelial malignant tumors. Estriol administration begun between 3 days before to 5 days after radiation did not alter mammary cancer incidence in six experiments. Monthly implantation of 2.5 mg tamoxifen (4.44 microns/mo) started 2 weeks after radiation reduced mammary cancer incidence from 83% to 14% after 307 to 314 days' observation (P less than 0.001 by chi-square analysis). Treated rats had atrophic ovaries and uteri consistent with blockade of endogenous estradiol activity. Short-term parenteral E3 or EE3 therapy using 10 to 30 micrograms/kg/day (35-100 microns/kg/day) rapidly differentiated virgin rat mammary glands without impairment of subsequent estrus cycles and offers an alternative to castration or life-long antiestrogen therapy for reduction of risk of radiogenic mammary carcinoma.\r"

The authors hybridized in situ seven inverted papillomas with RNA probes to human papillomavirus (HPV) 6, 11, 16, and 18. Four of these contained dysplasia, two were without dysplasia, and one contained invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Five inverted papillomas showed evidence of HPV infection based on hybridization. One with mild to moderate and one with severe dysplasia, and one without dysplasia hybridized with mixed probe HPV 6/11. One with mild dysplasia and one associated with invasive squamous cell carcinoma hybridized with mixed probe HPV 16/18. One inverted papilloma without dysplasia and one with severe dysplasia did not definitively hybridize with either mixed probe. These findings raise interesting questions as to role of HPV 6/11 and 16/18 in the development of inverted papillomas, and probably on the progression to and carcinoma.\r"

Recently, studies of nuclear DNA content in neuroblastoma have shown that an aneuploid DNA content predicts favorable clinical behavior. To determine if a correlation exists between these tumor biologic indicators, the authors analyzed both in a series of 39 patients with neuroblastoma. Flow cytometric DNA analysis performed on paraffin blocks determined that 23 patients had tumors with aneuploid DNA content (aneuploid tumors) and 16 patients showed no demonstrable anomalies of tumor DNA content (nonaneuploid tumors). Comparison of catecholamine levels in urine and tumor homogenates with DNA content data indicate that nonaneuploid neuroblastomas include a significant number (P less than 0.02) of biochemically primitive tumors which secrete high levels of 3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), dopamine and homovanillic acid (HVA). This suggests a dopamine-norepinephrine pathway block, which supports previous reports of deficiency of dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity in some neuroblastomas. The study shows that in contrast to aneuploid tumors, nonaneuploid neuroblastomas secrete higher levels of early pathway catecholamine metabolites and are more likely to present in higher (unfavorable) clinical stages of disease.\r"

A total of 230 and 790 gastric carcinomas located in the fundic and pyloric areas, respectively, were used to determine rates of invasion (IR) beyond the lamina muscularis mucosae relative to the size and histologic type of lesion. The IR values increased with carcinoma size in both areas. However, carcinomas in the fundic area demonstrated significantly higher IR rates (P less than 0.003) in every size class and for both poorly and well-differentiated lesions. Moreover, whereas small (less than 10 mm) invasive carcinomas were remarkably frequent in the fundic area, large (greater than 81 mm) noninvasive (mucosal) carcinomas were almost exclusively limited to the pyloric area. Thus gastric carcinomas in the fundic area were clearly shown to have a greater tendency to become invasive than those in the pyloric area. This may be related to differences in local anatomical and physiologic conditions.\r"

The 5-year survival rate increased with patient age in the low ploidy group whereas it decreased with patient age in the high ploidy group. There was a statistically significant difference (P less than 0.05) in the 5-year survival between our oldest patients with low (100%) and high ploidy (25.7%) gastric cancer. High ploidy cancers manifested a higher incidence of vessel invasion and lymph node metastasis. Our findings indicate that analysis of the DNA distribution pattern in gastric carcinoma is of prognostic value especially in older patients.\r"

They occurred in patients 23 to 54 years of age, with ten patients younger than 40 years of age. Microscopic examination revealed surface papillae that ranged from tall and thin to short and broad and contained central fibrous cores typically containing numerous inflammatory cells. The papillae were usually lined by stratified epithelial cells with slight to moderate nuclear atypicality and mitotic activity and no more than a minor degree of cellular budding. The deeper portions of the tumors were composed of branching tubular glands separated by a fibrous or fibromatous stroma and were more or less sharply demarcated from the adjacent cervical stroma. A hysterectomy was performed in 12 cases and only a cone biopsy in one case. The cone biopsy specimen and four of the hysterectomy specimens contained no residual carcinoma. In six uteri adenocarcinoma was confined to the inner third of the cervical wall whereas in two there was deep invasion. Follow-up of 2 to 14 years' duration including more than 5 years in ten cases has revealed no evidence of recurrent tumor. The excellent prognosis of the patients in this small series and the young age of many of them suggest that this tumor may be managed by a procedure less radical than a hysterectomy provided the tumor is superficial, has been completely excised, does not exhibit vascular space invasion, and close follow-up examination is possible.\r"

In this report ethanol preservation of bladder irrigation specimens was evaluated for flow cytometric analysis in a multiinstitutional study requiring specimen transport. Specimens from ten patients obtained at one center were preserved for varying periods of time in 50% ethanol, then distributed by express mail to four other participating centers, up to 3000 miles distant. On receipt, from 1 to 3 weeks after collection, the samples were processed and examined by flow cytometric study using propidium iodide as the fluorochrome. Forty-six of the 50 (92%) analyzed specimens gave satisfactory histograms. In 41 of the 46 adequate samples (89%), an aneuploid peak in the alcohol preserved (propidium iodide stained) specimen correlated well with the fresh (acridine orange stained) specimen. However, there was variable loss of DNA stainability with a broadening of the coefficient of variation in some alcohol-preserved specimens and an increase in cellular debris so that measurements of DNA index and percent hyperdiploid cells were considered unreliable. The authors conclude that ethanol preservation of bladder irrigation specimens for short periods of time may be a feasible alternative when flow cytometric analysis cannot be carried out on fresh specimens, but that this is not optimal fixation for specimens that must be transported and further studies of other fixatives are recommended.\r"

This study investigates the prognostic impact of Vv in 47 patients with malignant melanomas (10 years of follow-up) and compares Vv to traditional prognostic parameters and two-dimensional morphometric estimates. The averaged Vv was 226 microns3 and 457 microns3 in Stage I and II melanomas, respectively. The Vv was significantly increased in the case of ulceration, nodular melanoma, and Clark's level greater than III. The Vv showed only poor correlation to two-dimensional morphometric estimates. Cox regression analysis indicated Vv to possess excellent prognostic information, only rivaled by tumor ulceration, the latter being a 100% predictor of metastatic spread. Histologic type, Clark's level of invasion, tumor thickness (according to Breslow), and patient sex were without independent prognostic significance, which may be due to attributes of the small data base. It is concluded that Vv may be a powerful prognostic indicator in cutaneous melanomas, suitable for objective malignancy grading. The clinical and prognostic value of nuclear Vv needs further investigation in a larger and contemporary series of patients with malignant melanomas.\r"

Histology, presence of systemic symptoms (fever and sweats), and number of involved nodal regions were independent predictors of positive laparotomy.

The gold standard was histologically proven breast cancer. When a test was positive the participant was referred to the study surgeon for review. For screens one to five, sensitivity was 83, 71, 57, 83, and 77; specificity was 88, 94, 96, 96, and 96; and PPV was 3, 3, 4, 3, and 4, respectively. For 25,620 women aged 40 to 49 years who were eligible to receive only one PE, sensitivity was 71, specificity 84, and PPV 1.5. Using a binomial regression model, X2 for heterogeneity suggested there was no difference between nurse and physician examiners (P = 0.6879). Similar estimates made for the surgeons who performed 8914 reviews showed that sensitivity and PPV were higher than for the screen examiners and specificity was lower. These results support the conclusion that physical examination of the breasts by trained nurses is a useful component in screening for breast cancer.\r"

The authors studied 12 patients with unoperated colorectal cancer but without colorectal symptoms and six healthy volunteers as laboratory controls. All stools were collected for 2 weeks and analyzed by the HemoQuant and Hemoccult tests. In controls, the mean HemoQuant value was 0.7 mg hemoglobin (Hb)/g stool (range, 0.1-1.8) and all stools were Hemoccult-negative. In cancer patients, the mean HemoQuant was 3.3 mg Hb/g (range, 0.3-13.2); stools were within the normal HemoQuant range (less than 2 mg Hb/g) in 38% and negative by Hemoccult in 70%. The mean cancer detection rate testing a single stool per patient was 57% for HemoQuant and 25% for Hemoccult (P less than 0.001). The detection rate rose testing multiple stools and was maximal with five stools at 83% for HemoQuant compared to 31% for Hemoccult (P less than 0.001). The authors conclude that fecal blood levels are commonly normal with asymptomatic colorectal cancer. Although higher with HemoQuant than Hemoccult, cancer detection rates by fecal blood testing appear to be lower than previously reported.\r"

The evaluation was made both for patients who were \"potentially curable\" by surgery and, among those, for patients who were \"potentially cured.\" Using the Cox regression model, the serum levels of the three tumor markers, together with the knowledge of whether or not the tumor was polypoid were combined to make up the set of variables that best predicted patient outcome. These variables and their associated regression coefficients were used to classify the patients according to prognosis. The cancer-specific mortality rate for the 24% of potentially curable patients with the best prognosis was 15%; for the 26% of potentially curable patients with the worst prognosis, the cancer-specific mortality rate was 57%. For potentially cured patients among those who were potentially curable, the cancer-specific mortality rates for patients with the best and worst prognoses were 14% and 47%, respectively. The information provided by these preoperatively available variables together was comparable with that given by Dukes' staging system, but the latter system was more informative. On the other hand, some of the preoperative variables provided information not provided by Dukes' staging system.\r"

All 18 patients who had only surgical treatment and cancer limited to the corpus uteri showed no evidence of disease in follow-up of 5 to 13 years. Only 26.7% (four of 15) patients with cancer spread beyond the corpus were disease-free.

Thirty men with prostate nodules each had 14-gauge transperineal core biopsy and fine-needle aspiration. In 20 cases, cytologic smears and cell blocks and core biopsies agreed on a diagnosis: 12 benign and eight carcinoma. Of seven cases that were atypical by cytologic smears, five were benign on cell block and core; one was benign on cell block and carcinoma on core; and one was carcinoma on cell block and core. Three cases with scant specimens and diagnoses of carcinoma by cytologic smears were benign on cell blocks and cores: one contained seminal vesicle on review; one had repeat benign biopsies; and one had three microscopic foci of low-grade carcinoma in his radical prostatectomy specimen. This fine-needle aspiration technique provides histologic sections which are especially useful to those gaining experience with cytologic specimens of the prostate. Cases with discordant diagnoses on cell block and cytologic preparations warrant further evaluation.\r"

The median age was 68 years, and the male to female ratio was 1.5:1. Final diagnosis was basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in 901 patients (78%), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in 242 patients (21%), and basosquamous carcinoma in 11 patients (1%). Seven hundred twelve (62%) were biopsy proven. Comparison of clinical and histologic diagnoses showed that BCC were correctly diagnosed clinically in 85% of cases but only 53% of SCC were correctly diagnosed. The distribution of sites was as follows: head and neck 871 (75%), limbs 131 (11%), trunk 50 (4%), and multiple sites 102 (9%). One thousand eighty-nine (94%) had primary lesions and 65 (6%) had recurrent lesions. The lesions were treated with surgery in 55% of cases, superficial radiotherapy in 39%, other types of radiotherapy in 3%, cryotherapy in 1%, and 5-fluorouracil in 0.2%. Recurrent lesions, lesions on the eyelids, ears or nose, and T4 lesions were significantly associated with increased failure rates. Superficial radiotherapy was associated with a 2.3-fold increase in failure rate compared to surgery when other prognostic factors were taken into account (P = 0.01, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-4.3). Nonsuperficial radiotherapy was associated with an 11.5-fold increase in failure rate compared to surgery (P less than 0.0001, 95% confidence interval = 4.9-27.1), but several of these cases were treated for palliative purposes only. The results of, and indications for treatment with surgery or radiotherapy at PMCI are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Repolarization during phase 1 of cardiac action potential is important in that it may influence both impulse conduction in partially depolarized tissue and action potential duration. Thus, it is important to know the properties and regulation of the underlying currents. In about 50% of canine ventricular myocytes, the actin potential displays a phase 1 of fast repolarization and a prominent notch between phase 1 and the plateau. A transient outward current is responsible for both. This current is composed of two components: one (Ito1) blocked by 4-aminopyridine and the other (Ito2) blocked by manganese. In the present study, we characterized each of the components in isolation from the other. Both had an activation threshold between -30 and -20 mV. At the same voltage, Ito1 was larger than Ito2 and had a shorter time to peak. The peak current-voltage relationship for Ito1 was almost linear, but that for Ito2 was bell-shaped. Ito1 decayed during sustained depolarization with a single exponential time course: tau less than 30 msec at all voltages. It recovered from inactivation with a voltage-dependent time course: tau = 70 msec at -90 mV and 720 msec at -40 mV. Ito2 was augmented by elevating [Ca2+]o or by isoproterenol. It was inhibited by caffeine, ryanodine, or a preceding transient inward current, suggesting that it was activated by intracellular calcium released from sarcoplasmic reticulum. We conclude that Ito1 and Ito2 in canine ventricle are similar to those described for many other cardiac tissues, but the kinetics of Ito1 are significantly faster than in other tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular recordings were made from eustachian ridge of cat right atrium to determine mechanisms responsible for subsidiary pacemaker automaticity. Pacemaker action potentials exhibited two phases of diastolic depolarization: an initial steeper slope (D1) followed by a more gradual slope (D2). Cesium (1 mM) decreased D1 (-45.6%) to a significantly greater extent than D2 (-33.6%) and increased spontaneous cycle length (SCL) (+37.7%). Tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M) had no effect on maximum rate of rise of upstroke, although it increased SLC (+23.9%). Verapamil (0.4-1.0 microM) progressively increased SCL by decreasing late diastolic slope, resulting in oscillatory potentials and eventual quiescence. Both norepinephrine (2 x 10(-9) M) and Bay K 8644 (10(-7) M) elicited a significantly greater increase in D2 than in D1, resulting in a decrease in SCL. Ryanodine (10(-6) M) caused a small but significant initial decrease (-3.7%) followed by a progressive increase in SCL (+172%). Ryanodine decreased D2 without changing D1, increased maximum rate of rise and overshoot potential, and abolished tension. In the presence of ryanodine, Bay K 8644 progressively increased D1 amplitude, resulting in a cyclic pattern of dysrhythmic activity. In the presence of ryanodine, cesium significantly decreased D1 (-39.3%), shifted the late diastolic potential more negative, and increased SCL (+25.7%). These results indicated that multiple mechanisms participate in subsidiary pacemaker automaticity. They include 1) a cesium-sensitive component that contributes to a greater extent during the initial phase of diastolic depolarization, 2) a component mediated via calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that contributes primarily during the latter half of diastolic depolarization, and 3) possibly a direct contribution by the slow inward calcium current.\r"

  ".U": "89195606\r", 
  ".W": "Available data demonstrate that oxygen free radicals and derived reactive species of oxygen are produced during myocardial ischemia as well as upon reperfusion of the ischemic tissue. The present study was designed to determine if polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), with its extended plasma half-life in excess of 30 hours in contrast to the native form of the enzyme (Native-SOD), could provide protection to the ischemic myocardium subjected to a 6-hour regional ischemia followed by reperfusion for 24 hours. We hypothesized that myocardial injury due to an ischemic interval is a dynamic process involving the sustained production of cytotoxic oxygen radicals that may continue beyond the ischemic interval. The ability to demonstrate a protective effect of the free radical scavenger enzyme superoxide dismutase would require the continued presence of the antioxidant during the ischemic interval and especially during reperfusion. To test this hypothesis, 22 anesthetized, open-chest dogs underwent 6 hours of circumflex coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion for 24 hours. Rapid administration of either Native-SOD (1,000 U/kg), PEG-SOD (1,000 U/kg), PEG-albumin (PEG-ALB), or 0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection (saline) was administered via the left atrium 15 minutes before occlusion of the vessel. A continuous infusion of an additional 1,000 U/kg of the respective enzyme interventions or an equivalent volume of PEG-ALB or saline was given during the 6-hour coronary artery occlusion and terminated 15 minutes after reperfusion. The animals were euthanized 24 hours after reperfusion, and the myocardial region at risk and the infarct region were quantitated by the tetrazolium method. The area of myocardium at risk of infarction, expressed as a percent of the left ventricle, did not differ among the groups: Native-SOD (n = 8), 46.2 +/- 1.8%; PEG-SOD (n = 6), 45.7 +/- 2.1%; PEG-ALB, 38.4 +/- 2.3% (n = 4); and saline 46.0 +/- 2.1% (n = 4). Hemodynamic parameters, the calculated rate-pressure-product, as well as regional myocardial blood flow (radiolabeled microsphere method) in the endocardial, midmyocardial, and epicardial segments of the risk and the nonrisk regions were comparable for all groups. Mean infarct size, determined 24 hours after reperfusion, in the group treated with PEG-SOD was 47.1 +/- 2.9% of the area at risk (n = 6), significantly smaller than that observed in each of the other treatment groups: Native-SOD, 63.5 +/- 2.2% (n = 8); PEG-ALB, 64.6 +/- 2.4% (n = 4); saline, 70.8 +/- 2.2% (n = 4).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the mechanisms by which spontaneously beating cultured rat ventricular cells regulate intracellular pH (pHi). Specifically, the relative contributions of the Na+/H+ antiport, Cl-/HCO3- exchange, ATP, and calmodulin-dependent processes in regulating the pHi of cells loaded with the intracellular fluorescent pH indicator BCECF were investigated. The pHi of ventricular cells bathed in HEPES-buffered medium averaged 7.30 +/- 0.02. Subsequent exposure of the cells to CO2-HCO3- -buffered medium resulted in intracellular acidification followed by recovery to pHi levels approximately 0.1 pH units lower than in controls. Recovery was inhibited by the Na+/H+ antiport inhibitor 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA). The recovery from intracellular acidification, induced by a 15-mM ammonium chloride prepulse, was also dependent solely upon activation of the Na+/H+ antiport. Recovery was dependent upon extracellular sodium, was completely inhibited by EIPA, and could be modulated by changes in extracellular pH (pHo). At low pHo values (6.3) the recovery of pHi was greatly attenuated, while at high pHo (8.0) the recovery process was accelerated. The final pHi to which the cells recovered was also dependent upon pHo. Preincubation of the cells with 2-deoxy-D-glucose to deplete cellular ATP levels reduced pHi by approximately 0.2 pH units and greatly impaired the cells' ability to recover from 15-mM ammonium chloride-induced acid load. Similarly, preincubation of cells with the calmodulin inhibitors W-7 and trifluoperazine also impaired their ability to recover from the acid load. The Cl- -HCO3- exchange played no role in the cells' ability to recover from intracellular acidosis. However, the presence of HCO3- significantly increased the resistance of myocardial cells to changes in pHi by approximately doubling their buffer capacity. These results demonstrated that a Na+/H+ antiport is the major pHi-regulating system in spontaneously beating rat ventricular cells. The ability of the Na+/H+ antiport to regulate myocardial pHi is dependent upon the cells' ability to maintain adequate levels of ATP. The antiport's dependency on ATP, in conjunction with its dependency on calmodulin, suggests that activation of the antiport in ventricular cells involves phosphorylation processes.\r"

The goal of this study was to determine if hemorrhagic hypotension in rats produces differential effects on sympathetic outflow to the adrenal gland and kidney and if the two sympathetic nerve responses are governed by different reflex mechanisms. We performed simultaneous multifiber recordings of adrenal and renal sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) during 8 minutes of sustained hemorrhagic hypotension to a mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg in chloralose-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats with a) baroreceptors intact, b) cervical vagotomy, c) sinoaortic baroreceptor denervation, and d) combined vagotomy plus sinoaortic denervation. During hemorrhagic hypotension in rats with intact baroreceptors, renal SNA decreased by 31 +/- 10% (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05 vs. control) and heart rate decreased from 384 +/- 13 to 365 +/- 16 beats per minute (p less than 0.05), but adrenal SNA increased by 69 +/- 10% over control (p less than 0.05). The decreases in renal SNA and heart rate were reversed by cervical vagotomy but not by atropine, which indicates vagal afferent mediation. In contrast, the increases in adrenal SNA during hemorrhage were not affected by vagotomy alone or by sinoaortic denervation alone but were markedly attenuated by combined sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy, which indicates redundancy in the baroreflex control of adrenal SNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recent studies suggest that DS rats have poorly functioning baroreceptor afferents and baroreflexes even when salt intake is restricted. This study examines baroreceptor pressure- and mechano-transduction in DS, Dahl Resistant (DR), and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats during low- and high-salt conditions. Single unit, regularly discharging baroreceptors were studied using an in vitro aortic arch-aortic nerve preparation. Pressure thresholds and suprathreshold pressure sensitivities were determined from responses to slow ramps of pressure. Pressure-diameter relations measured in each rat were used to transform pressure threshold and pressure sensitivity values to their mechanical equivalents in terms of aortic wall strain. A total of 407 unit baroreceptors were studied from 49 rats. Tail systolic blood pressures were significantly higher only in DS during high salt. Pressure threshold was similar for all groups on low salt. Exposure to a high-salt diet increased the mean pressure threshold for all three groups. Pressure threshold for high-salt diet was highest in DS and lowest in DR. Pressure sensitivities were lowest in DS and highest in DR on low salt. High salt had no significant effect on pressure sensitivity. The differences in threshold apparent when expressed in terms of pressure were eliminated by conversion to their mechanical equivalents (strain threshold and strain sensitivity). The results suggest that baroreceptors in the two Dahl rat strains represent two extremes from normal baroreceptor function. DS tend to be less pressure responsive than normal (SD), and DR tend to be somewhat more responsive to pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects of phasic variations in intrathoracic pressure (ITP) timed to the cardiac cycle were predicted by a mathematical model and were compared with data from canine experimental studies. The model was used to predict the hemodynamic effects of changing the onset of the ITP rise relative to the start of cardiac systole, as well as the hemodynamic effects of changes in the duration and amplitude of the ITP rise. The predictions of the model were compared with hemodynamic data from seven anesthetized dogs. Cardiac function was depressed with large doses of verapamil and propranolol, and the hearts were atrioventricular sequentially paced at a rate of 72 beats/min. Phasic ITP variations were generated by a perithoracic vest and were electronically timed to the cardiac cycle. The model predicted, and the experimental data confirmed, that phasic intrathoracic pressure variations generated by vest inflation, timed to the cardiac cycle, can augment both peak and mean aortic flow. The following predictions of the model were also confirmed by the experimental data: 1) Maximum flow augmentation occurs when the onset of the ITP rise is simultaneous with the onset of left ventricular isovolumic contraction, and the ITP rise has a duration of 400 msec. 2) The magnitude of the flow augmentation is a function of the amplitude of the ITP rise. The experimental data showed that there was little further flow augmentation when the ITP rise was greater than 30-40 mm Hg. 3) The magnitude of flow augmentation was inversely proportional to the peak left ventricular elastance (Emax). The best fit between the measured and predicted flow augmentations was obtained for an assumed Emax of 0.5 mm Hg/ml, while Emax measurements in three dogs, using a volume conductance catheter and transient vena caval occlusion, yielded values of 0.4-1.6 mm Hg/ml. Thus, both the mathematical model and canine experiments showed that relatively low-amplitude ITP variations, rising synchronously with the onset of cardiac systole and having an optimal duration, assist the failing heart by augmentation of aortic flow. The degree of cardiac assistance decreases if the ITP variations do not rise synchronously with the onset of systole, or if their duration is not optimal. Thus, properly applied ITP variations may be used as an efficient, noninvasive method to temporarily assist the failing heart.\r"

  ".W": "Epicardial wall motion was measured on the left ventricular free wall in six isolated potassium-arrested dog hearts using a biplane video technique. Significant regional variations in epicardial deformations were recorded during static ventricular filling. Epicardial stretches varied linearly with cavity volume, sometimes exceeding 20% at physiological left ventricular end-diastolic pressures. The maximum component of epicardial stretch and the derived wall thinning increased substantially from the base to the apex on both the anterior and the posterior free walls of the left ventricle. In five hearts, the direction of greatest epicardial stretch at moderate and high filling pressures coincided closely with the local epicardial fiber direction, suggesting that the left-handed epicardial fiber helices stretch preferentially during passive filling to maximize end-diastolic fiber lengths. Epicardial rotation was always counterclockwise, consistent with a reduction in the pitch of the fiber helix during filling. These results suggest that, on the epicardial surface, the passive myocardium is anisotropic with respect to the local fiber direction. We suggest that the resulting torsional shear acts to minimize transmural gradients of fiber stretch.\r"

Epicardial coronary arteries of about 2 cm were cut open longitudinally, and the tension development of circular muscles was measured simultaneously at three sites (both cut ends and the midportion of the segment). Cyclic tension changes arising at one site of human coronary artery propagated smoothly to the other sites, and the whole length of segment worked as a single unit. Contraction induced by locally applied prostaglandin F2 alpha or histamine also propagated in four of seven preparations. The remaining three human and all seven pig coronary arteries showed propagation of such drug-induced contraction after treatment with 10 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA). In pig coronary arteries treated with TEA, electrical stimulation evoked a reproducible local contraction and its propagation. Propagation velocity was 9.0 +/- 0.7 at 0.8 mM calcium concentration and increased to 11.1 +/- 0.9 and 13.1 +/- 1.4 mm/sec as calcium concentration rose to 1.8 mM and 7.2 mM, respectively. Local contraction did not propagate at calcium concentrations of 0.2 mM or less. The calcium antagonist diltiazem decreased the propagation velocity dose dependently and blocked propagation of contraction at 0.3 microM without significant effects on the magnitude of local contraction. We conclude that smooth propagation of contraction develops in epicardial coronary arteries of humans and pigs and that the propagation may depend on calcium influx.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effects of myocardial hypertrophy resulting from chronic pressure overload on excitation-contraction coupling, the cardiac transmembrane L-type calcium current (ICa) was investigated in the Goldblatt renovascular hypertensive (HBP) rat. ICa was measured in single myocytes enzymatically isolated from control (CTRL) and HBP rat hearts using the whole-cell, patch-clamp method. The peak ICa and ICa density (obtained by normalizing ICa to the average cell capacitative surface area) were larger in HBP cells (n = 15) than in CTRL cells (n = 10) at membrane potentials of -20 to 50 mV (p less than 0.01). The maximal peak ICa increased from 0.9 +/- 0.5 nA (mean +/- SD) in CTRL cells to 2.8 +/- 1.0 nA in HBP cells (p less than 0.001). The corresponding ICa density increased from 5.3 +/- 2.7 to 16.2 +/- 6.0 microA/cm2 (p less than 0.001). There was no shift in the current-voltage relation between CTRL and HBP cells. The time course of decay of HBP ICa in response to clamp steps to the plateau range of the action potential (membrane potential, Vm = -10 to 30 mV) was delayed when compared with that of CTRL ICa. The inactivation time constants (biexponential) for the maximal ICa were 6.9 +/- 1.9 and 36.0 +/- 9.3 msec for CTRL cells and 6.7 +/- 1.4 and 49.5 +/- 12.9 msec for HBP cells (p less than 0.05 for the slower component of the maximal ICa). There was no difference in the steady-state inactivation of ICa (f infinity) for the CTRL and HBP cells. From the maximal peak ICa, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ was estimated to reach a pCa of 6.95 +/- 0.07 for CTRL cells and 6.64 +/- 0.13 for HBP cells. It is concluded that ICa is increased with myocardial hypertrophy. The lengthening of the action potential in hypertrophied rat myocardium is due to an increase in peak current density and to the slower inactivation of the maximal ICa. The increased transmembrane flux of Ca2+ via ICa in HBP cells is inadequate to achieve a myoplasmic free Ca2+ level sufficient for direct partial activation of the contractile myofilaments. However, in the scheme of the calcium-triggered calcium release hypothesis such an increase could provide an increased amount of activator calcium and/or serve to amplify the release of Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby contributing to preserved peak developed tension in hypertrophied rat myocardium.\r"

The total mechanical energy generated by ventricular contraction can be quantified by the total pressure-volume area (PVA) according to the time-varying elastance model. In this model, mechanical energy generated until a specified time (t) during systole can be quantified by the partial pressure-volume area, PVA(t). PVA(t) was obtained by quickly releasing ventricular volume at a varied time during isovolumic contraction. The quick release aborted further development of mechanical energy. We found that PVA(t) at a constant end-diastolic volume linearly correlated with myocardial oxygen consumption (VO2). This indicates that the oxygen cost of mechanical energy is time-invariant. However, we also found that the slope of the VO2-PVA(t) relation decreased with increasing quick-release speed. This indicates a decrease in VO2 by the quick release despite the same PVA(t). The time-invariant oxygen cost of mechanical energy is consistent with the time-varying elastance model of the ventricle, but the decreased VO2 with increasing quick-release speed despite the same PVA(t) is not.\r"

High molecular weight proteins were solubilized from junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum in zwitterionic detergent and purified by size-exclusion chromatography followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The purified proteins exhibited an apparent Mr = 400,000-350,000, and bound [3H]ryanodine with a Kd of 4.6 nM and a Bmax of 140-280 pmol/mg protein. High molecular weight proteins demonstrated divalent cation channel activity after incorporation into planar lipid bilayers. Two channel types were identified. Large conductance channels had a slope conductance of 96 +/- 13 pS and a Erev of 42 +/- 9 mV (n = 5); small conductance channels had a slope conductance of 5.5 +/- 1 pS [1.0 microM cis CaCl2; 50 mM trans Ba(OH)2]. Reducing cis calcium from 1 microM to 1 nM reduced the large conductance channel open time from 7 +/- 1% to 0.1% (holding potential, -100 mV). Adding ATP (1 mM) to the cis chamber increased channel open time from 6 +/- 1% to 52 +/- 4% (holding potential, -100 mV); 10 nM ryanodine increased and 100 microM ryanodine decreased percent of open time of the 96 pS channel, without altering unitary channel conductance. The large conductance channel was similar to the calcium release channel detected in native canine cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Our data suggest that the ryanodine receptor, the calcium-release channel, and the high molecular weight proteins are all identical proteins containing allosteric regulatory sites for calcium, ATP, and ryanodine.\r"

Angiotensin I (10 microM), angiotensin II (0.1 microM), and norepinephrine (10 microM) increased perfusion pressure, and norepinephrine, but not angiotensin I or II, contracted afferent arterioles, indicating that the vessels are reactive. The control diameter of the afferent arterioles that exhibited pressure-dependent contraction (n = 58) averaged 30.8 +/- 1.1 micron at perfusion pressure of 80 mm Hg. When pressure was increased from 80 to 120 and then to 180 mm Hg, the diameter of these arterioles decreased by 16.4 +/- 2.1%. Glomerular capillary pressure was well autoregulated and averaged 45.2 +/- 2.2, 50.2 +/- 2.4, and 53.0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg, respectively, at perfusion pressures of 80, 120, and 180 mm Hg.

Blocking tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism, with furosemide or by removal of the renal papilla (which interrupts the delivery of fluid to the macula densa), eliminated the pressure-dependent contraction of the afferent arterioles. Instead the diameter of these vessels increased by 27.0 +/- 7.8% and 36.0 +/- 5.6%, respectively, when the pressure was increased from 80 to 120 and then to 180 mm Hg.

Both diazepam and midazolam had large volumes of distribution (1.2 and 2.3 L/kg, respectively), but diazepam's half-life was considerably longer (33 versus 2.8 hours) and its metabolic clearance lower (0.5 versus 11.0 ml/min kg) than those of midazolam. EEG changes were maximal at the end of the diazepam infusion and 5 to 10 minutes after midazolam infusion. Percent 13 to 30 Hz activity remained significantly above baseline until 5 hours for diazepam but only until 2 hours for midazolam. For both drugs, EEG effects were indistinguishable from baseline by 6 to 8 hours, suggesting that distribution contributes importantly to terminating pharmacodynamic action. The relationship of EEG change to plasma drug concentration indicated an apparent EC50 value of 269 ng/ml for diazepam as opposed to 35 ng/ml for midazolam.

  ".W": "Healthy young black men and white men received single intravenous doses of metoprolol (0.07 mg/kg) or participated in an isoproterenol sensitivity study before and after metoprolol (0.07 mg/kg followed by 50 micrograms/min) in a randomized, crossed-over fashion. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The dose of isoproterenol versus change in heart rate response curves were constructed, and comparisons of dose ratio, ED50, Emax, and Ka, with the apparent association constant for metoprolol binding to beta 1-receptors, were made. There were no pharmacokinetic differences observed between the groups. The predicted Emax for the black group was 52.7 +/- 8.7 beats/min at a metoprolol concentration of 29.8 +/- 6.1 ng/ml, which was higher (p less than 0.05) than that in the white group, i.e., 43.7 +/- 7.3 beats/min at a concentration of 27.6 +/- 9.1 ng/ml. There were no differences in dose ratio, ED50, or Ka. The racial differences in beta 1-receptor responses to exogenous isoproterenol following metoprolol can simply be explained by an increase in beta 1-receptor activity in the black subjects, assuming homogeneity in cardiac beta 2-receptor responses.\r"

  ".W": "Right ventricular repolarization and refractoriness were studied during continuous infusion of lidocaine in patients with coronary artery disease. Compared with baseline the duration of monophasic action potential was shortened (p less than 0.01) at constant and premature stimulation. Early premature action potentials were less shortened (p less than 0.05). Therefore the difference between the longest and shortest action potential duration elicited 2 to 150 msec after refractoriness decreased during lidocaine infusion (p less than 0.01). The right ventricular effective refractory period was shortened similarly to the action potential duration. Lidocaine did not change the conduction of constant paced beats, whereas the more rapid conduction of the midrange premature beats was inhibited (p less than 0.01). The inhibition of premature conduction 50 to 150 msec from the right ventricular effective refractory period may be attributed to the effect of lidocaine on the rate-dependent recovery from inactivation. The effect on the restitution curve indicates that lidocaine may influence the dispersion of premature action potentials in human beings.\r"

Serum and urine were collected and analyzed for minoxidil. No systemic minoxidil accumulation occurred from increasing application frequency to the scalp. Trends in the chest data suggest that absorption may have been lower with the twice-daily regimen. Absorption through the scalp and chest were similar for the lower-frequency regimens; however, trends in the eight-times-a-day regimens suggest that absorption may have been somewhat greater from application to the scalp. Systemic minoxidil accumulation resulting from frequent application is unlikely. The initial dose probably saturates the skin for a period of time longer than the dosing intervals examined.\r"

Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent of intermediate lipophilicity that is eliminated by both hepatic metabolism and renal excretion, is eliminated stereoselectively in the kidney. In the present study we examined the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of atenolol, a hydrophilic cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent that is eliminated almost exclusively by the kidney. A single 100 mg oral dose of racemic atenolol was administered to six healthy adult men. Concentrations of d- and l-atenolol in plasma and urine were measured by a stereospecific HPLC analytic procedure. In each subject the peak concentration of d-atenolol was greater than the peak concentration of l-atenolol (mean +/- SD of 420 +/- 81 ng/ml vs 366 +/- 61 ng/ml; p less than 0.05). The peak concentration of both enantiomers was reached at the same time in each subject (between 2 and 3 hours). The renal clearances of d- and l-atenolol were not significantly different (109.7 +/- 33.5 ml/min vs 112.5 +/- 36.7 ml/min), probably because the major route of renal elimination is glomerular filtration. The half-lives of d- and l-atenolol were not significantly different (mean +/- SD of 4.6 +/- 1.1 hours vs 5.2 +/- 0.9 hours). However, both the AUC and the amount excreted unchanged in the urine in 24 hours Ae [0-24]) were significantly greater for d-atenolol than for l-atenolol (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To define the population at risk and the mechanisms involved in manifestations of this interaction, 12 patients currently treated with quinidine for either ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias were stratified into two groups based on left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) measurements (group A greater than 35%; group B less than 35%). The interaction was conducted through two phases: oral quinidine (Q) and oral quinidine plus nifedipine (N + Q). Pharmacokinetic modeling of total body clearance (CL) and AUC were assessed for each phase. One patient (group A, 70% EF) exhibited the interaction with a 41% decrease in steady-state serum quinidine concentrations. The patient's AUC and CL were 48.2 micrograms/ml.hr (Q) versus 28.6 micrograms/ml.hr (N + Q) and 94.4 ml/min (Q) versus 159.1 ml/min (N + Q), respectively. There was no difference in AUC or CL between the Q and N + Q phases or between groups A and B for the entire population. The N + Q interaction is not hemodynamically mediated. Clinical consideration of the possibility of this low-frequency interaction should be noted.\r"

The impaired ability of PMs to metabolize propranolol to the ring-oxidized metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol was confirmed. The total oral clearance of propranolol increased about fourfold in both phenotypes from 219.2 +/- 52.8 to 976.7 L/hr in the EMs and from 75.0 +/- 12.6 to 289.8 +/- 78.2 L/hr in the PMs. The extent of induction of glucuronidation was similar in the two groups. 4-Hydroxylation was induced in both phenotypes but the increase was fifteenfold greater in EMs than in PMs. This would imply that the cytochrome P-450 determined by the debrisoquin allele or some coinherited 4-hydroxylase(s) was induced to a greater extent in EMs than PMs.\r"

  ".W": "It is generally assumed that the systems involved in the transport of organic cations and organic anions in the renal proximal tubule are substrate selective (i.e., organic anions do not inhibit organic cation transport and vice versa). However, recent data obtained in vitro have suggested that the organic anion probenecid inhibits the renal transport of the organic cation cimetidine. We addressed the question of whether this interaction is biologically relevant in human beings. The study involved a two-treatment, randomized crossover design. Six healthy male subjects were given an intravenous infusion of 300 mg cimetidine alone as one treatment and, as the other treatment, received multiple oral doses of probenecid before receiving the cimetidine infusion. The renal clearance of cimetidine and inulin was determined in each period. There were no significant differences between treatments in cimetidine plasma concentrations, apparent volume of distribution, systemic clearance, half-life, amount of drug excreted unchanged in the urine, or nonrenal clearance. Probenecid significantly decreased the renal clearance of cimetidine by decreasing both the filtration clearance and the net secretory clearance. These effects were most evident in the first 1/2 to 1 hour after cimetidine administration, when probenecid levels in plasma and renal tissue would have been the highest. Because there was no effect of probenecid on cimetidine plasma concentrations, this interaction is not clinically relevant to the therapeutic use of these two compounds. However, the study demonstrates that renal interactions between organic cations and organic anions can occur in human beings. The mechanism of this interaction and the implications to other drug combinations are being explored.\r"

The TREND position (at 20 degrees) and PLR (at 60 degrees) were studied in relation to the level-supine position in random order. At 3 min, the TREND caused significant (p less than .05) decreases in heart rate (62 +/- 9 to 58 +/- 10 [SD] beat/min) and RVEF (0.48 +/- 0.11 to 0.44 +/- 0.10), and significant increases in mean arterial pressure (77 +/- 11 to 82 +/- 11 mm Hg), mean pulmonary artery pressure (16 +/- 4.3 to 19 +/- 5.5 mm Hg), wedge pressure (11 +/- 4 to 13 +/- 4 mm Hg), cardiac index (CI) (2.36 +/- 0.79 to 2.52 +/- 0.93 L/min.m2), right ventricular end-systolic volume index (44 +/- 21 to 58 +/- 21 ml/m2), right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (83 +/- 24 to 102 +/- 22 ml/m2), and shunt fraction (0.16 +/- 0.06 to 0.19 +/- 0.06). CVP and left ventricular areas did not change significantly. PLR had similar effects as the TREND position, except CI did not change significantly. Thus, the TREND and PLR resulted in minor hemodynamic improvement with right ventricular dilation, decreased RVEF, and impaired oxygenation in the anesthetized cardiac surgical patient.\r"

The group as a whole showed abnormal PEP/LVET ratio (0.40 +/- 0.02) that differed significantly (p less than .01) from reported normal values (0.345 +/- 0.002), demonstrating widespread left ventricular dysfunction in this population. In order to establish the prognostic significance of left ventricular impairment, the population was divided into two groups according to the PEP/LVET ratio. Group 1 (PEP/LVET less than or equal to 0.42) showed a mortality rate of 10/33 (30%), while group 2 (PEP/LVET greater than 0.42) had a significantly greater mortality (12/16 [75%], p less than .001).

Before propranolol RMR was moderately increased (126 +/- 10.4% of predicted values) whereas urinary excretion of catecholamines was markedly elevated (p less than .01 vs. normal values). RMR was significantly correlated with both resting heart rate (HR) (r = .72, p less than .01) and 24-h urinary N excretion (r = .85, p less than .001). The administration of iv propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) produced a rapid decrease in HR (-10 +/- 4%, p less than .001) and in RMR (-6.1 +/- 2.3%, p less than .001). Further administration of propranolol produced no additional reduction in either HR or RMR. We conclude that severely head-injured patients are moderately hypermetabolic in resting and postabsorptive conditions, and that acute iv propranolol administration induces a reduction of about one quarter of the resting hypermetabolism.\r"

We have previously demonstrated, in an adult model of hyperoxic lung injury, that bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid levels of AA metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway increase before evidence of overt injury. Nonselective inhibition with indomethacin or dexamethasone failed to ameliorate the injury process, possibly because production of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) was suppressed. In this study, we attempted to ameliorate hyperoxic lung injury using an infusion of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), since PGE1 has some of the potentially protective effects of PGI2. Thirty-two adult rabbits were exposed to greater than 95% oxygen; eight served as controls and 24 received PGE1 infusion (five, nine, and ten received 0.1, 0.06, and 0.03 micrograms/kg.min, respectively). At the end of the 65-h exposure period, BAL of the left lung was performed; the right was saved for light microscopy. PGE1 infusion at the 0.06 and 0.03-micrograms/kg.min doses resulted in significantly fewer polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in BAL fluid (p less than .05). However, PGE1 infusion did not significantly ameliorate the lung injury process. In summary, although PGE1 infusion inhibited the influx of PMN into the lung, treatment did not result in any significant amelioration of the hyperoxic lung injury process.\r"

To validate the impedance method, we compared it with the NaBr technique in nine anesthetized rabbits. Electrodes were placed for impedance measurement. Vascular catheters were inserted into the femoral artery and vein. Baseline impedance data were collected at 1.0 kHz and blood samples were drawn for NaBr standard assay. Using conventional assay techniques for determination of extracellular fluid volume (ECFV), we correlated NaBr data with impedance measurements. A linear relationship between ECFV by NaBr assay and the previously developed impedance equation rho L2/Z1.0 was established using regression analysis. A correlation value of r = .95 was obtained. These data suggest the potential for impedance to estimate ECFV.\r"

High-frequency oscillation (HFO) successfully improved pulmonary gas exchange, but we failed to wean the patient from HFO by using intermittent HFO. The patient was again placed on CMV for weaning and was extubated on the 12th ICU day.

In the absence of swallowing, esophageal peristalsis occurred at frequencies of 4-8 peristaltic sequences per minute for periods of 2-8 min. The recurrent peristaltic sequences developed spontaneously during manometry and were associated with the onset of vague chest discomfort in four patients; one patient reported no symptoms during recurrent peristalsis. Duration and propagation velocity of the recurrent peristaltic contractions differed significantly from primary peristalsis in four patients. Recurrent autonomous esophageal peristalsis is an unusual motor pattern that may be associated with vague chest discomfort. The circuit(s) mediating recurrent autonomous peristalsis are unknown.\r"

We investigated the possibility that local input can modulate the basic off-response through intrinsic mechanisms and make it resemble more closely the sequential ring contractions that move boluses in the esophagus of intact animals (esophageal peristalsis). The esophagus up to the aortic arch and down to the gastroesophageal junction was removed from opossums and suspended in an organ bath containing 2 liters of Krebs solution at 36 degrees C. The mechanical activity of the esophagus was recorded by force transducers on the serosal surface of the esophagus 2, 4, and 6 cm above the LES. The intramural nerves of the proximal esophagus were stimulated by electrical pulses with and without distension of the esophagus by inflation of a luminal balloon. Balloon distension increased the latency of the off-response in the distal esophagus, thereby reducing the velocity at which the circular muscle contraction spread through the esophagus. In addition, balloon distension increased the amplitude and the duration of the esophageal circular muscle contraction (both off- and on-responses), and decreased the amplitude of the longitudinal muscle contraction (duration response) and LES response (relaxation response). Similar changes in the esophageal contraction responses were produced by radial stretch of an open preparation of the esophagus from which the mucosa had been removed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Substance P-like immunoreactive nerve fibers were more abundant in muscularis mucosae than in the longitudinal smooth muscle layer and more abundant in the latter than in the circular smooth muscle layer. The distribution of substance P-like immunoreactive nerve fibers in the circular muscle layer of the esophagogastric junction was comparable to that of the esophageal body. Immunoreactive fibers were also found on and in arteries, submucosal glands, and epithelium, but none were seen in striated muscle. Both the myenteric and submucous plexuses contained substance P-like immunoreactive nerve cell bodies and processes. In the muscularis propria, the content of substance P-like immunoreactive peptide (pg/mg protein, means +/- 1 SE) in the smooth muscle region of the esophageal body (5.9 +/- 0.6) exceeded that in the striated muscle region (2.5 +/- 0.2) and at the esophagogastric junction (1.8 +/- 0.5), but the latter two values were similar (P less than 0.05). Mucosal content of substance P in the region of the esophagogastric junction (1.2 +/- 0.1) differed from that of the smooth muscle region of the esophageal body (9.2 +/- 2.6) but not (P greater than 0.05) from that of the striated-muscle region (5.9 +/- 1.0). The broad distribution and diversity of immunoreactive structures suggest that substance P may have both sensory and motor functions in the esophagus.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of sham feeding on gastric motility of human subjects have not previously been studied. The amplitude of 3-cpm electrogastrogram (EGG) waves increases after the ingestion of food. We hypothesized that sham feeding would stimulate a similar, but briefer gastric myoelectric response. Healthy human subjects chewed and expectorated a hot dog on a roll and later ate a second hot dog. EGGs were continuously recorded before, during, and after sham feeding and eating. The results of experiment I (N = 27) showed that the hand-scored amplitude of the 3-cpm waves increased significantly (P less than 0.01) during sham feeding. Two minutes after sham feeding, the mean amplitude of 3-cpm EGG waves returned to baseline level. The increase in EGG amplitude during eating was also significant (P less than 0.01), and remained increased for approximately 30 min after ingestion. The procedure used in experiment II (N = 20) was similar to experiment I, but EGGs were computer analyzed and power, ie, spectral intensities, at 3 cpm were obtained. The increase in power at 3 cpm during sham feeding and during eating was significant (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.02, respectively). Similar to experiment I, the duration of increase in power at 3 cpm was brief during sham feeding compared to the postprandial increase. Four vagotomized subjects failed to show an increase in power at 3 cpm in response to sham feeding. We conclude: (1) The cephalic-vagal stimulation of sham feeding increases briefly the amplitude and power of 3-cpm gastric myoelectric activity in healthy subjects but not vagotomized patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Prolonged recordings from the duodenum and proximal jejunum were achieved using a series of transducers mounted on a 2.3-mm catheter. A total of 58 interMMC intervals and the response to 18 meals was examined. There was marked inter- and intrasubject variability in the fasted state, even within one study. The phase II pattern was examined in detail and propagated single peaks, propagated clusters, and repeated propagated clusters are described. Single peaks could be propagated as rapidly as 16 cm/sec. Single peaks were propagated more rapidly than propagated multiple peaks. During phase III, duodenal contractions occurred at 11.3 +/- 0.09/min and jejunal contractions at 10.73 +/- 0.15/min. The rate of progression of the onset of phase III was 0.145 +/- 0.015 cm/sec. The effect of the caloric content of the meal was examined by determining the effect of 150-kcal, 300-kcal, and 600-kcal meals on the fed pattern. Increasing caloric content increased the duration of the fed pattern but had no effect on the total or normalized motility index or on the change in motility index over time during the fed pattern. The types of contractions seen during the fed pattern are described. Propagated clusters over at least 16 cm are common during the fed phase in normals, with 10% of all contractions seen during the fed phase being propagated over 28 cm. No difference in the patterns of contractions or their propagation was seen with the different caloric contents of the meals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although their role in experimental ulcerogenesis has been suggested, dopamine receptor activity in peptic ulcer disease has not been investigated. Radioligand binding studies were performed with mucosal tissue homogenates obtained from the antrum and duodenum of six male healthy volunteers and six male duodenal ulcer patients. The binding assay was performed in triplicate with a crude membrane fraction using [3H]dopamine as a ligand at a final concentration of 1 nM at 22 degrees C in the dark. Nonspecific binding (which usually comprised about 30% of total binding) was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled dopamine. A significant (P less than 0.05) increase of [3H]dopamine binding was found in duodenal mucosa of duodenal ulcer patients. [3H]Dopamine binding in stomach (antrum) of normal and duodenal ulcer patients did not differ significantly. These findings provide preliminary evidence for a role of dopamine receptors in duodenal ulcer and suggest that biochemical abnormalities of gut dopamine function may be operative in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease.\r"

Dopamine induced concentration-dependent alterations in frequency and propagation of slow waves. Development of irregular propagation was significantly suppressed by domperidone pretreatment. The variation of dopamine-induced slow-wave frequency was significantly inhibited by domperidone and phentolamine but not by propranolol, hexamethonium, and tetrodotoxin. The study indicates that a dopamine receptor exists in the stomach and plays a role in the genesis of gastric electrical abnormality.\r"

Initial D-xylose concentrations were linearly related to D-xylose absorption rates, a finding consistent with passive diffusion. Perfusion of D-xylose with varying D-glucose concentrations were aimed at examining D-xylose-D-glucose jejunal cotransport. D-Xylose absorption rates from a 30 mM D-xylose perfusate did not change significantly when 10, 30, or 60 mM glucose were added (-3.0 +/- 0.62 vs -3.34 +/- 0.71, -3.82 +/- 0.81, and -4.56 +/- 0.72 mM/30 cm/hr, respectively; minus indicates net absorption) suggesting an absence of a cotransport system. In brush border membrane vesicles, xylose uptake was partially inhibited by D-glucose and phlorizin. These data suggest that jejunal D-xylose absorption, at concentrations used clinically, is by passive diffusion, which process completely overrides a minor D-glucose cotransport component. The D-xylose tolerance test, therefore, reflects jejunal mucosal surface area and mucosal permeability to D-xylose and not nutrient carbohydrate absorption.\r"

L-[carboxyl-14C]Ascorbic acid, 0.19-0.40 megabecquerels (MBq), was given orally. After a period of equilibration, the labeled ascorbic acid was flushed out of the patient's body tissues using large doses of unlabeled ascorbic acid. Intestinal absorption of ascorbic acid, assessed from the total cumulative urinary 14C recovery, was found to be similar in patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease (73.9 +/- 8.45%), those without fistulas (72.8 +/- 11.53%), and in controls (80.3 +/- 8.11%). Total body pools of ascorbic acid, calculated using the plasma 14C decay curves, were similar in patients with Crohn's disease with fistulas (17.1 +/- 5.91 mg/kg), patients without fistulas (9.6 +/- 3.58 mg/kg), and in controls (13.3 +/- 4.28 mg/kg). The results indicate that ascorbic acid absorption is normal in patients with both fistulizing and nonfistulizing Crohn's disease. The results suggest that routine supplements of vitamin C are not necessary unless oral ascorbic acid intake is low.\r"

Its clinical efficacy in nonhormonally mediated diarrhea is limited, despite a potent antisecretory and proabsorptive effect in vitro. The effect of serosal addition of SMS 201-995 on in vitro short-circuit current responses in rat intestine is dependent upon chloride and more marked in colon and ileum than jejunum. In contrast, in vivo loop studies demonstrated that systemic administration of SMS 201-995 for five consecutive days produced a paradoxical decrease in basal colonic fluid absorption with no effect in jejunum or ileum. Furthermore, systemically administered SMS 201-995 did not alter cholera toxin-stimulated intestinal secretion. We conclude that despite a previously identified intestinal antisecretory and proabsorptive effect of SMS 201-995 in vitro, this effect is not seen in vivo and may explain the limited use of SMS 201-995 as an antidiarrhoeal agent in nonhormonally mediated diarrhoea.\r"

Therefore, we measured the concentration of 5-ASA in intestinal lymph and venous plasma during luminal perfusion of the cat small and large intestine with 10 mM 5-ASA. Blood and lymph flows were measured in each segment. 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA were extracted from plasma and lymph and quantified using fluorescence spectroscopy. Luminal perfusion of the terminal ileum with 5-ASA resulted in the following concentration profile: intestinal venous plasma (143 +/- 30 micrograms/ml) much greater than lymph (43 +/- 17 micrograms/ml) = systemic arterial plasma (40 +/- 11 micrograms/ml). In the colon the local venous plasma concentration of 5-ASA was 20 +/- 6 micrograms/ml compared to 2.0 +/- 1.0 micrograms/ml in systemic arterial plasma. N-Acetyl-5-ASA was found to comprise less than 5% of the total metabolite concentration in both ileum and colon. We also found that 58% of luminal 5-ASA was absorbed per minute in the terminal ileum, whereas only 3%/min was absorbed from the colon. The results of this study suggest that: (1) the mucosal interstitial concentration of 5-ASA in the terminal ileum and colon are approximately 100 micrograms/ml (654 microM) and 20 micrograms/ml (164 microM), respectively; and (2) the rate of 5-ASA absorption in the terminal ileum is approximately seven times greater than that in the colon.\r"

There was no apparent effect of CsA treatment on the gross or microscopic appearance of LGV proctitis, but CsA-treated animals, with or without LGV infection, had lymphoid hyperplasia of spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. CsA treatment inhibited the primary antibody response to LGV, inhibited peripheral blood lymphocyte mitogen-induced proliferation and IL-2 production, and inhibited LGV-specific proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes. In contrast, mitogen-stimulated proliferation of spleen, mesenteric lymph node, and lamina propria lymphocytes was not significantly inhibited in CsA-treated animals. In addition, LGV-specific proliferation of spleen and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes was not inhibited. High mitogen-stimulated IL-2 production of lamina propria lymphocytes was only partially inhibited in CsA-treated animals. In vitro CsA treatment had the expected inhibitory effects on mitogen- and antigen-induced proliferation of spleen and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes. Thus, although oral cyclosporin inhibits the antibody and proliferative responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes to antigens and mitogens in animals having Chlamydia trachomatis proctitis, it does not prevent the expansion of antigen-specific, gut-associated, and spleen lymphocyte populations.\r"

Glycoprotein profiles were also examined using three labeling methods, and in each case marked differences were observed between microvillus and basolateral membranes. In both membranes, lectins with a specificity toward N-linked sugar chains bound to the majority of the glycoproteins, in contrast to those lectins which preferentially bind to O-linked sugar chains. Glycolipids were labeled in vivo and isolated from both membrane fractions. Some differences were observed in the fucolipids and neutral glycolipids suggesting a more complex pattern in microvillus membranes. These results indicate that there are differences in the glycoprotein and glycolipid compositions of microvillus and basolateral membranes that may reflect the functional polarity of intestinal epithelial cells.\r"

After 24 days of immunization, rats were anesthetized and a 10-cm intestinal segment was intubated and ligated at both ends in situ. The intestinal loop was perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The effluents were collected for measurement of IgA and IgG by the ELISA. When compared with the effect of intravenous administration of normal saline in the control group, intravenous injection of GABA (30 mg/kg) resulted in a significant increase of IgA and IgG secretion in the experimental group. These stimulatory effects of GABA on secretion of IgA and IgG were abolished by bicuculline, a GABA-receptor antagonist, and by atropine, indicating that the GABA-stimulated secretion of IgA and IgG was mediated via the GABA receptors and cholinergic muscarinic receptors. These results suggest that GABA may participate in the nervous regulation of intestinal secretion of IgA and IgG antibodies in the rat.\r"

This report describes a patient with primary amyloid whose esophageal dysfunction was limited to the lower esophageal sphincter, with both a hypertensive sphincter and impaired relaxation after swallows. Pharmacologic testing confirmed a mild abnormality of the inhibitory pathway to the LES with an intact excitatory pathway and sphincter muscle. This case suggests that amyloidosis, like idiopathic achalasia and carcinoma of the lower esophagus, can produce dysphagia by selective impairment of the inhibitory neural pathway to the lower esophageal sphincter.\r"

Although hypocaloric diets should be recommended to these patients, many find compliance with this diet difficult; therefore, the safety of an isocaloric increase in dietary carbohydrate needs assessment. Lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride (TG, mg/dl) concentrations in isocaloric high-fat and HICARB diets were compared in 7 NIDDM subjects (fat 32 +/- 3%, fasting glucose 190 +/- 38 mg/dl) and 6 nondiabetic subjects (fat 33 +/- 5%). They ate a high-fat diet (43% carbohydrate; 42% fat, polyunsaturated to saturated 0.3; fiber 9 g/1000 kcal; cholesterol 550 mg/day) for 7-10 days. Control subjects (3 NIDDM, 3 nondiabetic) continued this diet for 5 wk. The 13 subjects changed to a HICARB diet (65% carbohydrate; 21% fat, polyunsaturated to saturated 1.2; fiber 18 g/1000 kcal; cholesterol 550 mg/day) for 5 wk. NIDDM subjects on the HICARB diet had decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol) concentrations (107 vs. 82, P less than .001), but their high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol) concentrations, glucose, and body weight were unchanged. Changes in total plasma TG concentrations in NIDDM subjects were heterogeneous. Concentrations were either unchanged or had decreased in 5 and increased in 2 NIDDM subjects. Nondiabetic subjects on the HICARB diet had decreased LDL-chol (111 vs. 81, P less than .01) and unchanged HDL-chol and plasma TG concentrations).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Moreover, Mexican-American diabetic people have more severe hyperglycemia and diabetic retinopathy than non-Hispanic White diabetic people. Mexican Americans are predominantly of low socioeconomic status (SES), and low-SES Mexican Americans have a higher prevalence of NIDDM than higher-SES Mexican Americans. Therefore, we hypothesized that among diabetic people, low SES would be associated with more severe hyperglycemia and retinopathy. Three hundred forty-three Mexican Americans and 79 non-Hispanic Whites with NIDDM were identified from the San Antonio Heart Study, a population-based study of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Hyperglycemia was assessed as the sum of the fasting, 1-h, and 2-h plasma glucose concentrations during a standard oral glucose tolerance test. Retinopathy was assessed by 7 standard stereoretinal photographs. SES was assessed with three indicators: Duncan's socioeconomic index, education, and income. Contrary to expectations, low SES was not associated with greater levels of hyperglycemia or grades of retinopathy.\r"

The patient's plasma was found to contain anti-insulin antibodies and large amounts of extractable insulin (1110 microU/ml), which was identified as human insulin by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The anti-insulin antibodies consisted solely of IgG and lambda-light chains. Scatchard analysis of these antibodies revealed an almost straight-line relationship, with markedly low affinity and high capacity. An immune complex made of 125I-labeled insulin and the patient's antibodies emerged in a molecular-sieve HPLC as almost a single peak, suggesting a homogeneous antibody population. In addition, the patient's M protein was separately shown to be the IgG and lambda-light-chain type. We suggest that the insulin autoantibodies responsible for the spontaneous hypoglycemia in this patient are monoclonal and of M protein origin.\r"

Both interventions involved five weekly meetings that focused on reducing calorie intake, increasing dietary fiber, and decreasing fat consumption. The social learning condition also included individualized goal setting and feedback and training in problem-solving and relapse prevention. Within-group analyses and between-group comparisons generally revealed greater improvement in targeted goals (e.g., calorie intake, fat reduction) among intervention conditions than the control condition. There were few differences in more distal measures of outcome such as weight or glycosylated hemoglobin. The social learning component did not improve outcome more than the nutrition education program. Possible reasons for the observed findings and the advantages and limitations of focused time-limited diabetes education efforts are discussed.\r"

To determine possible risk factors to these infections, we studied several factors in the management of CSII and compared the pyogenic skin inflammation rate, the carriage rate of Staphylococcus aureus, and the HbA1 level among 50 CSII-treated diabetic patients, 50 diabetic patients on insulin injections, 48 diabetic patients on oral medication, and 40 healthy volunteers. There was no increased carriage rate of S. aureus among CSII-treated patients (42%) as compared with the other groups. An unexpected inverse relationship existed between HbA1 level and carriage rate in the CSII-treated group (HbA1 5-8%, n = 16, 69%; HbA1 8-10% n = 15, 40%; HbA1 greater than 10, n = 19, 21% P = .02). Pyogenic skin inflammations were reported by 24 (48%) CSII-treated patients, of which 18 had infected infusion sites, 6 (12%) insulin injecting patients, 2 (4%) patients on oral medication, and 3 (8%) healthy volunteers (P less than .01). The occurrence of inflamed infusion sites was not associated with carriage of S. aureus, the indwelling time of the needle, or the insulin dosage per day. There was an association, however, with the type of insulin preparation classified according to the added preservative: m-cresol-containing insulin (n = 24, 54%); methyl p-hydroxybenzoate-containing insulin (n = 26, 19%, P = .02). We concluded that the carriage of S. aureus is not increased among diabetic patients on CSII treatment and is not a risk factor in the occurrence of inflammation at the infusion site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The peak mitral valve flow velocities during the early rapid filling phase (E) and during late atrial filling (A) were measured, and the ratio of these peak flow velocities (E:A) was calculated. E was similar in both groups, but A was higher (P less than .01) in the diabetic group. Thus, E:A was lower (1.19 +/- 0.24 vs. 1.65 +/- 0.67; P less than .01) in the diabetic subjects than in the control subjects. On subgroup analysis, 6 patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy had lower E:A than the patients with no such disorder (0.99 +/- 0.15 vs. 1.29 +/- 0.25; P less than .05). E:A was not related to the duration of diabetes, presence of retinopathy, HbA1, or blood glucose levels. In conclusion, the atrial contribution to left ventricular filling seems to be augmented in diabetic subjects. This finding indirectly supports the view that left ventricular compliance is already reduced in asymptomatic diabetic subjects.\r"

To investigate the relationship of learning deficits to metabolic control, 23 children with IDDM (age at testing 71 +/- 21 mo, age at diagnosis 35 +/- 15 mo) diagnosed before 5 yr of age were followed for periods of 6-78 mo. Mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1), episodes of severe hypoglycemia, and frequency of self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) measurements less than 2.8 mM (50 mg/dl, asymptomatic hypoglycemia) were recorded every 3 mo. Six subjects entered the study 12.3 +/- 6.7 mo after diagnosis, and only severe hypoglycemia was present before entry. For the remaining 17 subjects, HbA1 and severe and asymptomatic hypoglycemia were present from the time of diagnosis of diabetes. Mean HbA1 level was 10.1 +/- 1.0%, and mean severe hypoglycemic episodes per patient was 2.9, but the frequency was highly skewed; one patient had 37 episodes, and 14 had none. The mean percentage of SMBG readings less than 2.8 mM was 2.4 +/- 2.1. On the revised Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale there was no correlation between any subscale and severe hypoglycemia. However, the relative frequency of asymptomatic hypoglycemia correlated with scores on the abstract/visual reasoning scale (r = -.39, P = .037). This relationship was primarily accounted for by the relationship of asymptomatic hypoglycemia to performance on the copying subscale (r = -.42, P = .022). Children with frequent asymptomatic hypoglycemic episodes had lower mean copying scores and abstract reasoning scores than those with infrequent episodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study has extended these earlier observations by determining the metabolic effects of such diets over a longer period in these patients. The comparison diets contained either 40 or 60% of the total calories as carbohydrates, with reciprocal changes in fat content from 40 to 20% consumed in random order for 6 wk in a crossover experimental design. The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat and the total cholesterol intake were held constant in the two diets. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were significantly (P less than .001) elevated throughout the day when patients consumed the 60% carbohydrate diet, and 24-h urinary glucose excretion more than doubled (0.8 vs. 1.8 mol/24 h). Fasting plasma total and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride (TG) concentrations increased by 30% (P less than .001) after 1 wk on the 60% carbohydrate diet, and the magnitude of carbohydrate-induced hypertriglyceridemia persisted unchanged throughout the 6-wk study period. Total plasma cholesterol concentrations were similar after both diets. However, VLDL cholesterol (VLDL-chol) was significantly increased, whereas both low-density lipoprotein (LDL-) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-) chol concentrations were significantly decreased after consumption of the 60% carbohydrate diet. Consequently, neither total-chol-to-HDL-chol nor LDL-chol-to-HDL-chol ratios changed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both groups were comparable for all subject characteristics except body mass index, which was higher in the diabetic group (P less than .05). A taste impairment was found in the diabetic group relative to the control group with electrogustometry (mean threshold 184.3 +/- 15.8 vs. 58.7 +/- 9.2 microA; P less than .001) and chemical gustometry (mean score 13.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 17.1 +/- 0.8; P less than .001). Hypogeusia was found among 73% of the diabetic patients versus 16% of the control subjects (P less than .001). The four primary tastes were involved in taste impairment. With multivariate analysis, taste disorders were related to diabetic status and tobacco and alcohol consumption. In the diabetic group, taste impairment was significantly associated with complications and duration of disease. With multivariate analysis, peripheral neuropathy had the strongest association with taste disorders. These results suggest that taste is impaired during the course of type I diabetes mellitus and that taste impairment could be a complication of the disease. A mechanism of the neuropathic type could be involved.\r"

  ".W": "The reliability of patient-generated data from self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was studied in 14 patients with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus treated by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (7 women, 7 men). The reflectance meters (Glucometer I, Ames, Elkhart, IN) used by the patients were replaced for a period of 21 days by memory-reflectance meters; patients were unaware of the memory capacity of the new meters and were instructed to continue their practice of recording the meter readings in their logbook. This study compares the data recorded in the memory-reflectance meters with those reported in the logbook. The number of SMBG measurements was different in 11 patients (differences ranging from 2 to 66). Mean glycemia was similar (8.23 +/- 0.36 mM in logbook vs. 8.49 +/- 0.48 mM in memory-reflectance meters), but both the M value and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) index were lower when calculated from logbook data (38 +/- 5 vs. 48 +/- 7 mM, P less than .05 and 6.91 +/- 0.43 vs. 7.72 +/- 0.52 mM, respectively; P less than .05). Overreporting (addition of phantom values in logbook) and underreporting (omission of SMBG measurements from logbook) indexes were 19 +/- 7 and 12 +/- 3%, respectively. Precision (percent of identical values in logbook and in memory-reflectance meters at the corresponding time) was 77 +/- 6.8%. The number of SMBG measurements recorded in the memory-reflectance meter was negatively correlated with glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c; (r = -.85, P less than .001)], whereas overreporting was positively correlated with HbA1c (r = .76, P less than .01).\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of hospitalized and ambulatory patients have found a higher prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization in diabetic than nondiabetic subjects. We examined this association in a geographically based study among 551 residents of the San Luis Valley of Colorado and found no statistically significant increase in the relative risk of nasal S. aureus colonization in 188 non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) versus 363 nondiabetic subjects (relative risk 1.3, 95% confidence limits 0.9-1.8). Adjustment for confounding by age, sex, ethnicity, county of residence, and frequency of hospitalizations or physician visits in the previous year did not affect the results. Among the diabetic subjects, S. aureus colonization was not associated with type of treatment for diabetes, level of glucose control, clinical duration of diabetes, or frequency of hospitalizations or physician visits in the previous year. In this population-based study, diabetes mellitus did not increase S. aureus nasal colonization, suggesting that factors other than diabetes mellitus may have caused the higher colonization rate found in previous clinic-based studies.\r"

Blood glucose levels during testing were precisely maintained at the preselected level via a Biostator insulin/glucose-infusion system. The order of glycemic level was counterbalanced across subjects in a single-blinded design. Performance on tasks requiring visual tracking, visuomotor speed, concentration, and planning ability (pursuit rotor and trails B) were significantly impaired under conditions of hypoglycemia compared with normoglycemic levels. Visual reaction time was not significantly impaired under conditions of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "Although diabetes mellitus is reported in 29% of patients with renal papillary necrosis (RPN), the frequency of RPN among patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) has from autopsy studies been estimated to be only 4.4%. In vivo data on the prevalence of RPN in patients with IDDM have been lacking. We therefore studied the prevalence of RPN in 76 patients with long-standing IDDM and in 34 age-matched control subjects by intravenous urography. None of the control subjects showed radiographic signs of papillary necrosis. RPN was observed in 18 patients (23.7%); 15 were women (83.3%). Age and duration of diabetes was not different between patients with and without papillary necrosis, and there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the prevalence of microangiopathic complications, i.e., proliferative retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy. Microscopic hematuria was three times more frequent in patients with than without RPN (44 vs. 16%; P less than .02). In addition, pyuria was reported in 40% of patients with papillary necrosis, and 61% of them gave a positive history of urinary tract infection compared to 16% (P less than 05) and 32% (P less than .02), respectively, in patients without papillary necrosis. It is concluded that RPN is a more frequent complication of long-standing IDDM than appreciated from autopsy studies, and being female and having a history of urinary tract infection are associated with an increased risk of RPN.\r"

Hypoglycemic symptoms were experienced at least monthly in 5.9% and less frequently in 14.3% of patients. The prevalence of symptoms decreased with increasing duration of sulfonylurea administration (P less than .01). Mean glycosylated hemoglobin and postprandial plasma glucose were significantly lower in patients reporting hypoglycemic symptoms than in those without symptoms (P less than .001). The prevalence of hypoglycemic symptoms was significantly higher in patients treated with glyburide than in patients treated with gliclazide (P less than .01) or chlorpropamide (P less than .05). The prevalence of symptoms was higher in patients taking medications in addition to OHAs (P less than .01). Ten (24%) of the patients who experienced hypoglycemic symptoms were taking drugs that may potentiate sulfonylureas.\r"

However, there are few solid leads concerning human diabetogenic environmental agents. A case-control study was carried out to investigate the possible relationships between IDDM and various biological, chemical, and psychological factors. All 161 cases of IDDM among children aged 0-17 yr occurring in Montreal from 1983 to 1986 were included. The parent of each newly diagnosed diabetic subject was asked to provide the names of two of the child's friends or neighbors who would be age and sex matched to serve as controls. For those unable to do so, matched controls were selected from a hospital emergency room. Parents of cases and controls were interviewed concerning many factors. There was little or no difference between cases and controls with regard to parental smoking habits, exposure to pets, and consumption of meat products high in nitrosamines. In univariate analyses, there was some indication of elevated risk for children who had not been breast-fed, who attended day care or nursery before age 5 yr, who lived in a crowded household at age 3 yr, or who had a history of asthma or eczema, although in multivariate analyses the only variables that had any effect were crowding and day-care attendance. In univariate and multivariate analyses, there was high risk of IDDM among children who had experienced selected stressful life events during the 12 mo preceding onset of IDDM or who had exhibited symptoms of social or psychological dysfunction during that time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The CR3-45 NM Canon nonmydriatic fundus camera detects relevant diabetic retinopathy with high sensitivity. To determine whether examination of one eye per patient would suffice for screening purposes, 473 pairs of standard 45 degree fundus Polaroid prints obtained with the Canon camera were assessed from 167 patients with and 306 without diabetic retinopathy. On the basis of considering only one eye per patient, absence of retinopathy would have been diagnosed in 336 patients, with 9% of the diagnoses false negative. One hundred thirty-seven of the 167 patients with retinopathy in at least one eye would have been diagnosed correctly by considering one eye per patient (sensitivity 82%, specificity 100%). Thus, a standard 45 degree fundus Polaroid print from one eye per patient may suffice for screening purposes if the picture is free from diabetic abnormalities. Otherwise, both eyes should be examined immediately, and the patient should be referred to an expert ophthalmologist who specializes in diabetic retinopathy for confirmation of the diagnosis and staging of diabetic retinopathy status.\r"

  ".U": "89196812\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies in vitro have shown that various mechanical methods used to wound plasma membranes allow normally impermeant, water-soluble markers, such as fluorescein dextran or horseradish peroxidase, to enter the cytosol. Subsequent membrane resealing traps these nontoxic fluorescent or electron microscopic markers within living, surviving wounded cells. The present report is the first, to our knowledge, to use this strategy to study cell membrane wounding and resealing in the intact animal. We show that gut cells wounded in vivo by mechanical forces are capable of resealing disruptions of their plasma membranes. More importantly, we show that wounding of cell membranes, followed by resealing, occurs not only in mechanically injured gut but also in normal, experimentally undisturbed gut. A variety of cell types were wounded and resealed membrane wounds in the mechanically injured stomach: surface mucous, endothelial, fibroblastic, parietal, and chief cells. Mucous cells successful at resealing membrane wounds apparently became active participants in the motile events of stomach repair. In undisturbed gut, cell membrane wounding and resealing was most frequently observed in the colon, but was also observed in the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and ileum. Surface epithelial cells in undisturbed gut were retained for greater than 48 h after surviving membrane wounds. Two important roles are suggested for membrane resealing in gut: (a) preservation of motile cells nearest epithelial discontinuities requiring repair after injury, and (b) maintenance of epithelial integrity in normally functioning gut. Our finding of cell wounding in undisturbed gut may explain, in part, why rapid, continual cell turnover is characteristic of gut epithelia. We propose that membrane disruption, or wounding, is a normal and common occurrence in vivo, and that a biologically significant function of the plasma membrane is to reseal such wounds. The occurrence of in vivo cell membrane wounding and resealing suggests an unrecognized route for molecular traffic into and out of cytoplasm.\r"
