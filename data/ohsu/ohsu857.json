  ".W": "During a 5-d period that commenced on August 30, 1987, dry lightning strikes ignited more than 1,500 fires that destroyed in excess of 600,000 acres of California forests. To evaluate the public health impact of the smoke on the general population, all hospital emergency rooms located in the six counties most severely affected by smoke or fire were surveyed. Selected hospital information was abstracted for a 2 1/2-wk period during the fires and during two reference periods. During the period of major forest fire activity, visits of persons with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased in number (observed/expected ratios of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively), as did visits of persons with sinusitis, upper respiratory infections, and laryngitis. A few patients with acute respiratory or eye irritation also visited the emergency rooms. Even recognizing the limited sensitivity of emergency room surveys, the overall public health impact was relatively modest. The increased respiratory morbidity detected in this survey, however, supports the notion that persons with pre-existing respiratory disease represent a sensitive subpopulation, who should be targeted for purposes of public health intervention when exposure to forest fire smoke is likely.\r"

The purpose of the study was to investigate the application of EMS for pressure sore prevention. Limitations of pressure measurements for analysis of load distribution are discussed and a rationale developed for using tissue shape and deformation to further characterize the seating interface. Ultrasonic imaging of the seating interface is described under three conditions: buttocks suspended, external load applied with no EMS, and external load applied with bilateral EMS of the buttocks. Results show that low level stimulation of the gluteus maximus produces substantial changes in the shape of the loaded buttocks and an external contour more nearly shaped like the suspended buttocks. It is concluded that EMS produces buttock tissue undulation and shape reconfiguration which may assist in preventing pressure sores over the seating surface.\r"

Reflex parameters were compared to normal standards and correlated with other electrophysiologic (eg, electromyography) and clinical evaluations, as well as magnetic resonance imaging scan reports. The H-reflex had significantly smaller peak-to-peak amplitude and longer latency. The stimulus threshold for eliciting the reflexes was substantially higher than normal standards, and the reflex was polyphasic in most patients. A strong correlation was recorded between the pathologic changes in reflex parameters and electrophysiologic and clinical findings of different segmental lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging reports showed moderate correlation with the H-reflex changes. A test of specificity showed that soleus and vastus medialis H-reflexes were 100% specific for lumbosacral segments; flexor carpi radialis was 90% specific for cervical spinal segments. These results indicate that flexor carpi radialis, vastus medialis, and soleus H-reflexes are useful and valid methods for testing C7, L4, and S1 radiculopathy.\r"

  ".W": "This review has summarized some of the evidence suggesting that cytokines may play an important role in mediating pathophysiologic events in RA. However, these proteins are capable of mediating both stimulatory (agonist) and inhibitory (antagonist) effects in the rheumatoid synovium. GM-CSF, IL-1, TNF alpha, and PDGF are all produced in the rheumatoid synovium and may function to induce inflammation, enzyme release, fibroblast proliferation, and tissue destruction. Local release of IL-6 may alter the effects of IL-1 and TNF alpha, as well as induce Ig production and hepatic synthesis of acute-phase proteins. However, specific inhibitors of IL-1 and TNF alpha exist, which, if also released into the synovium, may antagonize the proinflammatory effects of these cytokines. In addition, IL-1 may have antiinflammatory effects, such as the induction of the synthesis of collagen and enzyme inhibitors by chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts. Stimulation of these latter cells by TGF beta also may result in decreased matrix degradation and increased formation of scar tissue. The developing scenario is one of cell-cell interactions that are influenced in positive and negative manners by the local release of various mediators. A further understanding of cytokines and cytokine inhibitors in the rheumatoid synovium may lead to the development of more specific and effective therapeutic agents.\r"

An intent-to-treat analysis showed significantly greater improvement (P less than 0.01) with MTX for painful and swollen joint counts and physician and patient global assessments of disease activity. Adverse reactions were reported more frequently in the AUR group, and more AUR-treated patients were withdrawn from the study because of toxicity.

The supercoil-dependent B-Z equilibrium in recombinant plasmids was used as an indicator of structural changes induced in circular DNA. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that PROC and HYD strongly inhibited supercoil-induced Z-DNA formation, whereas NAPA caused less pronounced changes in the B-Z equilibrium, and CAN had no effect. Gel retardation assays showed that the binding of a Z-DNA-specific autoimmune antibody to a Z-DNA-containing plasmid was strongly perturbed by HYD, but not influenced by CAN. Both PROC and NAPA showed moderate inhibition of antibody binding. Our results demonstrate the different potentials of these 4 drugs to interact with DNA and to alter the tertiary topology of DNA domains. It is conceivable that the in vivo capacity of PROC and HYD to induce antinuclear antibodies may be related to their ability to influence structural features in chromosomal DNA domains or nucleosomes, thus liberating antigenic structural epitopes in DNA and/or DNA-associated proteins.\r"

Such an association may be causal, indicating that STDs increase susceptibility to, or infectivity of, HIV infection or may result, in whole or in part, from the mutual dependence of HIV and STDs on patterns of sexual activity, or from an effect of HIV infection on the clinical course of STDs. In this paper we discuss the issues arising in the design and analysis of studies conducted to investigate this association. A numerical illustration is used to demonstrate non-causal associations that may arise in observational studies due to confounding and misclassification. Published cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are reviewed, and recommendations made for future studies. Special emphasis is given to the use of randomized intervention trials to overcome many of the biases associated with observational studies, and to provide information on the efficacy of intensive STD treatment programmes in reducing the transmission of HIV.\r"

This acceptable loss of sensitivity could be reduced further by lowering the cut-off at which single sera of pools were tested: 96% of the above 70 anti-HIV-1-positive sera were detected. During testing of 618 pools containing 6180 sera from a low-risk population, lowering of the cut-off increased the number of pools with testing of individual sera from five (containing one confirmable anti-HIV-1-positive serum each) to only six (containing no anti-HIV-1-positive serum). Therefore, testing of pooled sera from a low-prevalence population group reduced the costs of testing about ninefold and technician time by about 25-50%.\r"

Two panels, consisting of 96 sera from 15 people and 140 sera from 44 people seroconverting to HIV, were examined. In the first group the synthetic peptide assay (gp41 EIA) detected antibodies before the Genetic Systems EIA in seven out of 15 people and concurrently in the remaining eight. With the second panel the Abbott ENVACORE assay detected antibodies before the gp41 EIA in two out of 44 people while the gp41 EIA detected antibodies first in six out of 44. In the remaining 36 people antibodies were detected simultaneously by the two tests.

In this study 36 consecutive patients were examined by two-dimensional echocardiography within 4 hours of radionuclide-determined right ventricular ejection fraction to test a simplified method for calculating right ventricular ejection fraction by two-dimensional echocardiography. Echocardiographic measurements were independently determined in the subcostal and apical four-chamber views. Correlation with first pass radionuclide right ventricular ejection fraction was r = 0.89 and 0.84. Right ventricular ejection fraction could be calculated from one of two views in 92% of patients studied. This technique for determination of right ventricular ejection fraction offers a simple noninvasive method of evaluating right ventricular function.\r"

No significant variations in the patient profiles were encountered. Most patients were white (33 of 35) with a mean age of 45 years. The diagnosis was suspected on clinical grounds alone in only six of 35 patients before the echocardiogram was done. M-mode recordings were the primary echocardiographic modality available in the first 16 patients, whereas two-dimensional studies were also done in the others. Continuous and pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography were added in eight of the most recent studies. In one patient color flow imaging from both transthoracic and esophageal approaches was possible to better visualize a large left atrial tumor. Thirty-three patients had solitary tumors (29 left atrial, three right atrial, and one left ventricular), and two had multiple tumors. The most characteristic finding, as expected, was the demonstration of abnormal mass echoes produced by the myxoma tissue. Several interesting features not previously emphasized in the literature included abnormal notching of the interventricular septum and posterior left ventricular wall probably produced by displacement from the larger mobile left atrial tumors dropping into the mitral sleeve. This was best appreciated by the M-mode recordings. In one patient with an associated atrial septal defect, movement of the tumor into the defect appeared to alter the expected downward displacement into the mitral orifice. In the patients who were studied by two-dimensional, Doppler, or color flow imaging, tumor movement was evidenced by abnormal frequency shifts, and dispersion of flow around the tumor mass was readily appreciated. Surgical removal was performed in all patients. Follow-up echocardiograms were done postoperatively ranging up to 17 years. Recurrent tumors occurred in two patients, both of whom had congenital myxomas. Echocardiography is proving to be an unparalleled tool in the diagnosis of intracardiac tumors.\r"

It is likely that advances in imaging may enhance or supplement these approaches. For example, three-dimensional reconstruction methods may greatly augment the accuracy of volume determination if they become more efficient. The development of three-dimensional methods will depend in turn on vastly improved transthoracic resolution similar to that now obtainable by transesophageal echocardiography. Better resolution will also make the use of more direct methods of measuring myocardial mass practical. For example, if the epicardium were well resolved in the long-axis apical views, the myocardial shell volume could be measured directly by the biplane method of discs rather than extrapolating myocardial thickness from a single short-axis view. At present, it is our opinion that current technology justifies the clinical use of the quantitative two-dimensional methods described in this article. When technically feasible, and if resources permit, we recommend the routine reporting of left ventricular ejection fraction, diastolic volume, mass, and wall motion score.\r"

The use of magnesium sulphate was associated with less serious morbidity (in terms of recurrence of convulsions, cardiopulmonary problems, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and acute renal failure) but the difference was not statistically significant (relative risk 0.6; 95% CI 0.3 to 1.2). The one maternal death occurred in the magnesium sulphate group. Convulsions recurred in five (21%) women in the magnesium sulphate group and seven (26%) women in the diazepam group. Urine output poor enough to prompt diuretic stimulation was less frequent in the magnesium sulphate group than in the diazepam group (RR 0.3; 95% CI 0.1 to 0.9). Significantly fewer infants born in the magnesium sulphate group had low Apgar scores (less than 7 at 1 min) compared with those in the diazepam group (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9). There were two early neonatal deaths in the magnesium sulphate group, and three stillbirths in the diazepam group. This study suggests that magnesium sulphate has advantages over diazepam for the mother and the infant in the treatment of eclampsia, but the trial is small and should be replicated on a larger scale.\r"

Asymmetrical growth retardation in the newborn was assessed by Rohrer's ponderal index and the mid-arm/occipito-frontal circumference (MAC/OFC) ratio within 72 h of birth, a neonatal ponderal index or MAC/OFC ratio below the 10th centile being considered abnormal.

As long as the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remained below 106 mmHg, oxprenolol, or oxprenolol plus dihydralazine, were given to the early treatment group, and matching placebos to the control group. Open antihypertensive treatment was provided for patients whose DBP rose above 105 mmHg. Proteinuria occurred in seven women in each group. In the early treatment group, 13 of the 78 women were delivered by caesarean section; the corresponding numbers in the control group were 27 of 76 (17 vs 36%, 95% confidence interval (CI) of difference: 5-33%); the sections included seven and 16 in the early treatment and control groups, respectively, for severe hypertension and/or fetal distress. There were five perinatal deaths, two in the early treatment group and three in the control group. Early treatment did not influence gestational age at birth or birthweight. Respiratory distress syndrome occurred in four infants in the early treated group and in 10 in the control group; 14 infants in the former group and 26 in the latter were in hospital for more than 10 days (18 vs 35%; 95% CI of difference 4-32%). These results indicate that early antihypertensive treatment with oxprenolol is safe for the fetus and newborn in pregnancy-induced hypertension, but has no advantage over non-pharmacological care in terms of fetal growth. However, it may prevent acute hypertension in late pregnancy and associated fetal distress, and thus reduce the number of caesarean sections.\r"

Ninety-five women were studied and the mean interval between the last study and delivery was 1.4 days. An abnormally elevated umbilical artery systolic:diastolic (AB) ratio was present in 61 (64%) of the women. All 10 perinatal deaths were associated with pregnancies with an abnormal umbilical artery AB ratio. An elevated umbilical artery AB ratio was significantly associated with small-for-gestation and neonatal morbidity. Infants associated with extremely high umbilical artery AB ratios (greater than or equal to 99th centile) spent twice as long in the neonatal nursery as those with a lower value. There was no relation between the duration of hypertension and the umbilical study result. The uteroplacental bed artery flow velocity waveform did not correlate with fetal or neonatal mortality or morbidity. Patients with abnormal uteroplacental AB ratios also had abnormal umbilical artery AB ratios. We conclude that an abnormal fetal umbilical artery Doppler flow velocity waveform correlates with adverse fetal outcome in severe proteinuric pregnancy hypertension and suggest that the associated placental lesion may precede the maternal hypertension.\r"

Of seven relevant published reports of controlled trials, six had involved women considered to be a high risk of miscarriage or preterm birth. This analysis provides no support for the view that 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate protects against miscarriage, but suggests that it does reduce the occurrence of preterm birth. The latter effect was reflected in a reduced rate of low birthweight babies, but not in a statistically significant reduction in perinatal mortality and morbidity. The difference between this meta-analysis and the two earlier meta-analyses illustrates the problems both of selective sub-grouping and of comprehensive pooling of data from small trials.\r"

A new treatment for this T-lymphocyte-mediated condition uses an immunotoxin, H65-RTA, comprised of a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the CD5 lymphocyte differentiation antigen coupled to ricin A chain, a cytotoxic enzyme that inhibits protein synthesis. The safety and efficacy of this lymphocyte-targeted immunotoxin was evaluated in patients with severe AGVHD in a phase I-II dose escalation study with group expansion at the two middle doses. Thirty-four patients received up to 14 daily intravenous infusions of the immunotoxin. The principal side effects were constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and myalgias, and hypoalbuminemia with weight gain was seen at all doses. Thirty-two patients were evaluated for improvement or resolution of disease. Durable complete or partial responses were not dose-related and were seen in 16 patients. Skin GVHD had the highest incidence of response (73%), although improvement or resolution in gastrointestinal tract (45%) and liver (28%) GVHD was also noted. Survival in responding patients was significantly prolonged at all times as compared with those with no response (P = .03). Treatment was associated with a rapid decrease in peripheral blood T lymphocytes, which persisted for greater than 1 month after therapy. Anti-immunotoxin antibodies were seen in 6 of the 23 patients tested; these were of low titer and did not block immunotoxin binding to T cells. Results of this study indicate that anti-T-lymphocyte immunotoxins may form a new class of immunosuppressive agents useful in T-lymphocyte-mediated diseases.\r"

  ".U": "90199063\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the effect of recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) on murine megakaryocytopoiesis in vitro, the factor was added to both serum-free colony assays and liquid marrow cultures. GM-CSF had a significant megakaryocytic colony-stimulating activity. After 2 hours of preincubation with and without 10 ng/mL rGM-CSF, the percentage of megakaryocyte colony-forming cell (CFU-MK) in DNA synthesis was determined by tritiated-thymidine suicide using colony growth. The reduction of CFU-MK colony numbers in marrow culture was 47.5% +/- 9.9%, 20.9% +/- 5.2% (control), respectively, indicating that the factor affected cell cycle at CFU-MK levels. When acetylcholinesterase (AchE) production was measured fluorometrically after 4 days of liquid culture, rGM-CSF elicited an increase in AchE activity in a dose-dependent fashion. To determine if the hematopoietin acts directly on megakaryocytic differentiation, 2 ng/mL rGM-CSF was added to serum-free cultures of 295 single megakaryocytes isolated from CFU-MK colonies. An increase in size was observed in 65% of cells initially 10 to 20 microns in diameter, 71% of cells 20 to 30 microns, and 40% of cells greater than 30 microns. Conversely, in absence of GM-CSF, 17%, 31%, and 10% of cells in each group increased in diameter. These data suggest that rGM-CSF promotes murine megakaryocytopoiesis in vitro and that the response to the factor is direct. To determine if the factor influences megakaryocytic/thrombocytic lineage in vivo, 1 and 5 micrograms of rGM-CSF were administered intraperitoneally every 12 hours for 6 consecutive days. Although a two- to three-fold increase in peripheral granulocytes was observed, neither megakaryocytic progenitor cells or platelets changed. Histologic analysis of bone marrow megakaryocytes showed no increase in size and number. The in vivo studies demonstrated no effect of GM-CSF on thrombocytopoiesis. The discrepancies between the in vitro and in vivo effects of GM-CSF require additional investigations.\r"

  ".W": "Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) control the proliferation of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in vitro. Previously, we have shown that receptors for GM-CSF and IL-3 are often coexpressed on AML cells. Here we present experiments with purified AML blasts, normal monocytes, and granulocytes that were conducted to analyze the properties of GM-CSF and IL-3 binding proteins in more detail. On AML cells from eight cases we demonstrate two types of GM-CSF receptors: one with low affinity (dissociation constant [kd] 5.1 to 24.8 nmol/L) and one with a high affinity (kd 31 to 104 pmol/L). These AML cells also expressed high affinity receptors for IL-3 (kd 24 to 104 pmol/L). Cross-competition experiments showed that an excess concentration of nonlabeled IL-3 completely prevented the high affinity binding of radiolabled GM-CSF. This competition occurred at 37 degrees C as well as 4 degrees C. Low affinity GM-CSF binding was not affected by IL-3. Binding of radiolabeled IL-3 could be prevented by nonlabeled GM-CSF. In certain cases, this competition was complete, whereas in others only partial (49% to 77%) reduction of the radiolabeled IL-3 binding was seen. On the basis of these ligand binding features, we propose the existence of three receptor types on AML cells: (1) low affinity GM-CSF receptors that do not bind IL-3, (2) dual high affinity GM-CSF/IL-3 receptors, and (3) high affinity IL-3 receptors that do not bind GM-CSF. We could also demonstrate these receptor types on normal monocytes. In addition, a fourth type of receptor was apparent on normal granulocytes (4), incapable of binding IL-3 and with an intermediate affinity for GM-CSF (approximately 400 pmol/L). Chemical crosslinking showed that GM-CSF and IL-3 both bind to proteins with molecular weight values of 130, 105, and 75, which provides additional evidence for the existence of a common GM-CSF/IL-3 receptor complex.\r"

  ".W": "A possible role for calmodulin in the colony growth of human hematopoietic progenitor cells was investigated using pharmacologic approaches. We obtained evidence for a dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation of myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-C) stimulated by interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) by three calmodulin antagonists, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride (W-7), N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride (W-13), and trifluoperazine. Chlorine-deficient analogs of W-7 and W-13, with a lower affinity for calmodulin, did not inhibit the growth of CFU-C colonies. W-7, W-13, and trifluoperazine inhibited the colony formation of immature erythroid progenitor cells (BFU-E) stimulated by IL-3 plus erythropoietin (Ep) or GM-CSF plus Ep, in a dose-dependent manner, while they did not affect the colony formation of mature erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E) induced by Ep. W-7, W-13, and trifluoperazine also led to a dose-dependent inhibition of GM-CSF-induced colony formation of KG-1 cells. Calmodulin-dependent kinase activity derived from the KG-1 cells was inhibited by these three calmodulin antagonists in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that calmodulin may play an important regulatory role via a common process in the growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells stimulated by IL-3, GM-CSF, and G-CSF. Mechanisms related to the growth signal of Ep apparently are not associated with calmodulin-mediated systems.\r"

  ".W": "beta-Lactam antibiotics cause platelet dysfunction with bleeding complications. Previous in vitro studies documented reversible inhibition of agonist-receptor interaction. This mechanism is inadequate to explain the effect of beta-lactam antibiotics in vivo. Platelet function does not return to normal immediately after drug treatment, implying irreversible inhibition of platelet function. We report here evidence of irreversible platelet functional and biochemical abnormalities after in vitro and in vivo exposure to beta-lactam antibiotics. Irreversible binding of [14C]-penicillin (Pen) occurred in vitro. After 24 hours' in vitro incubation with 10 to 20 mmol/L Pen, or ex vivo after antibiotic treatment, irreversible functional impairment occurred; but no irreversible inhibition of alpha 2 adrenergic receptors, measured with [3H]-yohimbine, or high-affinity thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TXA2/PGH2) receptors, measured with agonist [3H]-U46619 and antagonist [3H]-SQ29548, occurred. However, low-affinity platelet TXA2/PGH2 receptors were decreased 40% after Pen exposure in vitro or in vivo, indicating irreversible membrane alteration. Two postreceptor biochemical events were irreversibly inhibited in platelets incubated with Pen for 24 hours in vitro or ex vivo after antibiotic treatment. Thromboxane synthesis was inhibited 28.3% to 81.7%. Agonist-induced rises in cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) were inhibited 40.1% to 67.5% in vitro and 26.6% to 52.2% ex vivo. Therefore, Pen binds to platelets after prolonged exposure, resulting in irreversible dysfunction attributable to inhibition of TXA2 synthesis and impairment of the rise in [Ca2+]i. The loss of low-affinity TXA2/PGH2 receptors suggests that the primary site of action of these drugs is on the platelet membrane.\r"

The role of HRs and nuclear DNA content in the spread and prognosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was studied from paraffin-embedded tumor sections of 104 patients followed-up for the minimum of 5 years after the diagnosis. HR expression was analyzed by staining with a monoclonal antibody, Hermes-3, and DNA content by flow cytometry. Ten (10%) lymphomas were HR negative (HR-), 14 (13%) weakly (HR+/-), and 80 (77%) strongly positive (HR+). HR- lymphomas disseminated less often than HR+/- or HR+ lymphomas (P = .03), and their prognosis was more favorable (P = .03), although they often had a large S phase fraction (SPF), indicating a rapid proliferation rate. A large SPF (greater than 12%) was strongly associated with an unfavorable histologic type in Working Formulation (P = .0001) and poor survival (P = .006), whereas DNA aneuploidy was not. The 5-year survival rate corrected for intercurrent deaths was 61% in lymphomas with SPF less than 12% or with HR-, but only 15% if SPF was greater than 12% and HR+ (P less than .0001). In multivariate analysis stage (P less than .001), SPF (P = .002) and HR (P = .003) were the only independent prognostic factors.\r"

No method satisfies all requirements for the ideal treatment--quick healing, no hospital admission, minimal patient inconvenience, and low recurrence--but greater awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods would lead to improved management. Early excision of the pilonidal pit at the time of treatment of pilonidal abscess reduces the high (40 per cent) risk of subsequent sinus. Treatments for pilonidal sinus that flatten the natal cleft halve the risk of recurrence. En block excision of pilonidal sinus with secondary healing should be abandoned and emphasis given to development of treatments, such as primary asymmetric closure, which have more potential. Some treatments are operator-dependent and, to achieve the best results, junior surgeons must be correctly trained and supervised. Future treatment studies must be prospective and randomized, and should compare healing time, recurrence rates beyond 3 years, nurse and hospital visits, patient inconvenience and loss of income.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the efficacy of continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block on postoperative pain and pulmonary function, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 56 patients undergoing elective thoracotomy. Infusion was started before closing the chest and was continued for 5 days. Subjective pain relief was assessed on a linear visual analogue scale. Pulmonary function was measured on the day before operation and daily for 5 days. There were 29 patients in a group which received bupivacaine and 27 in a control group which received saline. The bupivacaine group had lower pain scores (P less than 0.01) and required less papaveretum (P less than 0.01) than the control group. Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s and peak expiratory flow rate were maximally reduced at 24 h to median values of 56, 60 and 57 per cent, respectively, of preoperative control values in the bupivacaine group, and to 25, 30 and 32 per cent in the control group. These differences are highly significant (P less than 0.01). Restoration of pulmonary function was superior in the bupivacaine group (P less than 0.01). There were no infusion-related complications. After thoracotomy, continuous intercostal blockade with bupivacaine is a safe and effective method of pain relief which reduces the early loss of postoperative pulmonary function significantly and more rapidly restores respiratory mechanics.\r"

  ".W": "The successful purification of several mite allergens within the last few years has considerably enhanced our understanding of mite allergen immunochemistry. The role of these glycoproteins in stimulating human IgE ab and their role as immunogens in mice and rabbits has been studied extensively in a number of laboratories worldwide. In particular, purified allergens have facilitated the production of murine IgG Mabs that have been used to purify mite allergens by affinity chromatography; to investigate the diversity of antigenic sites on purified allergens; and to develop Mab based immunoassays for measuring allergen concentrations in dust samples and extracts. Full amino acid sequencing of several mite allergens is now in progress together with efforts to identify antigenically important peptide fragments. Such investigations are aimed to further increase our knowledge of humoral and cellular immune responses at the molecular level. For years, pollen counts have been used to judge airborne pollen allergen levels and to predict, in turn, the severity of symptom days for patients with hay fever. In contrast, simple methods for measuring dust allergens (e.g., mite allergen) have not been available. The development of Mab immunoassays, which can be converted from radiolabeled to enzyme labeled or fluorescence labeled assays, should provide rapid and quantitative measurements of specific mite allergen levels in house dust. Not only can such measurements provide useful clinical information in judging the exposure of patients to mite allergen, but the effectiveness of allergen avoidance regimes can be monitored objectively. By measuring the concentration of specific allergens in extracts, these assays could significantly improve efforts to standardize extracts used for diagnosis and treatment.\r"

In women with symptoms from the breasts, lightscanning did not contribute to clinical examination and mammography. In the screening situation, it was poor to pick up small cancers. Mammography alone falsely diagnosed cancer in 6.9% of the patients whereas lightscan falsely diagnosed cancer in 19.1%. Lightscan was not better than mammography in young women. The study shows that lightscanning in its current form is inferior to standard mammography.\r"

Histologic and ultrastructural examination of these cases showed conventional poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of cuboidal or polygonal tumor cells in the medullary area with scattered AFP-positive cancer cells. Comparative studies on serum AFP between these cases and in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or in testicular yolk sac tumor cases using concanavalin A (ConA)-affinity and lens culinalis agglutinin A (LCA)-affinity sepharose columns revealed that the AFP derived from four cases had a high ConA nonadsorping rate and high LCA-reactive fraction similar to that of yolk sac tumor. The AFP from one case had a small LCA-reactive fraction similar to that of HCC. Further immunohistochemical study using several markers for liver cells or germ cell tumor did not show additional evidence of these tumor cells to differentiate into liver cells or yolk sac tumor cells. Thus, this study indicates that AFP-producing gastric carcinomas are not always derived from hepatoid differentiation of the foregut. These gastric carcinomas might be categorized into medullary tumor with gastrointestinal tract-specific AFP.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of endotoxin on colon tumors was studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Colon tumors were induced in weanling rats by the administration of 20 weekly subcutaneous injections of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). When colon tumors were detected by colonoscopy in 80% of the rats around week 24 after DMH injection, the animals were divided randomly into two groups. One group served as the control. The other group received six endotoxin (Escherichia coli) treatments every fifth day. The first dose was 50 micrograms/100 g (intraperitoneally); the remaining doses were 100 micrograms/100 g (subcutaneously). Rats were killed 2 weeks after the last endotoxin injection. Endotoxin treatments resulted in larger colon tumors. The median tumor size was 71 mm2 for endotoxin-treated and 31 mm2 for untreated rats (P less than 0.02). Endotoxin treatments also resulted in a significantly higher incidence (P less than 0.05) of ulcer development in the small intestine, that is 47% in the endotoxin-treated versus 23% in the untreated rats. After a single subcutaneous injection of endotoxin (100 micrograms/100 g), the colon mucosal reduced glutathione (GSH) level was raised by 21% at 16 hours, reached a peak on day 2, then decreased to baseline by day 4. The increased GSH level in the colon mucosa was maintained up to the third endotoxin injection. By the fifth injection, no increase in the GSH level was observed. These results suggest that the growth of colon tumors in rats induced by DMH could be enhanced by endotoxin treatments. The enhanced tumor growth may be due to an increase in the colon GSH level and/or other mediators released by macrophages as a result of endotoxin treatments.\r"

These tumors provide valuable opportunities for the analysis of hormone biosynthesis and secretion in the neoplastic human endocrine cell. The authors studied a pancreatic endocrine tumor obtained from a patient with classical glucagonoma syndrome. Characterization of plasma and tumor glucagon-like immunoreactivity (GLI) by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay for GLI showed different chromatographic profiles, with glucagon the major molecular form in the tumor, and glicentin and oxyntomodulin predominating in plasma. Although immunocytochemical staining of the tumor showed only focal weak positivity for glucagon, tumor extracts contained large amounts of immunoreactive GLI peptide. Northern blot analysis of tumor RNA demonstrated that abundant glucagon mRNA transcripts were present, just slightly larger in size than those detected in normal pancreas and intestine. Electron microscopic analysis of the tumor cellular ultrastructure revealed only occasional small electron dense secretory granules. A large number of complex lysosome-like structures of variable size and electron density were detected throughout the cytoplasm and ringing the nucleus of most cells, a feature atypical of endocrine tumors of the pancreas. Primary cultures of dispersed tumor cells were established and, in contrast to previous results, were obtained using normal or neoplastic islet cell models, GLI secretion was found to be stimulated eightfold by incubation with 5 mM dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Phorbol myristate acetate, the calcium ionophore A23187, and sodium butyrate had no effect on GLI secretion in vitro. These observations indicate that neoplastic human A cells may have abnormalities at different points in the biosynthesis and secretion of glucagon.\r"

The authors report two cases of cystic metastatic sarcoma of the lungs that illustrate the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic difficulties encountered in the diagnosis of these lesions. In one patient, multiple small, thin-walled cystic metastases from a lower leg leiomyosarcoma were the only manifestation of metastatic disease. The cystic lesions did not change over an 8-month period and a diagnosis of malignancy was not established until spontaneous pneumothorax, presumably due to rupture of the malignant blebs, prompted a thoracotomy. In the second patient, three thin-walled bullae developed after treatment of noncystic pulmonary metastases from a lower-leg synovial sarcoma. In both patients, the cystic lesions were not evident on chest radiographs, but were well visualized with computed tomography (CT), where they mimicked benign bullous disease. However, additional small cavitary lesions not seen with CT were present in resected pulmonary wedge specimens from both patients. A great degree of variability in the cellular composition of the cyst wall lining in both cases, and a lack of any solid neoplastic tissue masses in one case, led to histopathologic difficulties that required immunohistochemical studies for definitive diagnosis of the metastatic disease. These cases show that pulmonary bullae, even though thin-walled and benign-appearing on CT, may be a manifestation of pulmonary metastases. These lesions must therefore be surgically removed from patients in whom a curative resection of pulmonary metastases is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Pursuant to a promising report suggesting that an allopurinol mouthwash could have a protective effect against 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced stomatitis, the authors performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. Seventy-seven patients, receiving their first 5-day course of chemotherapy with 5-FU +/- leucovorin, were assigned to use a mouthwash containing 20 mg of allopurinol or a placebo. The mouthwash was administered every hour for four doses commencing with each chemotherapy dose. The severity of subsequent mucositis was graded (on a 0-4 scale) by the attending physician and also by a patient-completed questionnaire. There was trend toward less mucositis in the placebo group with mean physician-judged mucositis scores of 1.3 for placebo and 1.8 for allopurinol (P = 0.07) and mean patient-judged mucositis scores of 1.5 for placebo and 1.9 for allopurinol (P = 0.15). There were no substantial differences in mucositis attributable to the two mouthwashes in the patients who crossed-over on their second cycle of chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that the tested allopurinol mouthwash regimen does not offer any protective effect against 5-FU-induced mucositis.\r"

Ninety-six patients received Urografin, 98 received iopamidol, and 92 received iohexol. The groups were similar in all respects. Variables measured before and after contrast injection were left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), RR, PR, and QTc intervals, QRS duration, ST segment change greater than 2 mm, arrhythmias, and symptoms. The adequacy of coronary and ventricular opacification was assessed by two experienced observers. Following left ventriculography, small rises in LVEDP occurred with iopamidol and iohexol (mean +/- SD: 18 +/- 7 to 21 +/- 7 mmHg) and a moderate fall in LVSP with Urografin (150 +/- 32 to 133 +/- 32 mmHg). Following coronary angiography there was a progressive fall in SAP (130 +/- 26 to 117 +/- 30 mmHg) and prolongation of RR intervals (900 +/- 138 to 1,266 +/- 692 msec) and QTc (440 +/- 61 to 471 +/- 73 msec) and QRS duration (87 +/- 25 to 100 +/- 27 msec) with Urografin. There was a small fall in SAP with iopamidol (138 +/- 25 to 128 +/- 27 mmHg) and prolongation of QRS duration with iohexol (85 +/- 29 to 90 +/- 24 msec). Other parameters were not significantly affected. Frequent bradyarrhythmias (sinus pause 14.5%, asystole 6%) and ST segment depression occurred following Urografin. Urografin was less well tolerated, with 10% of patients experiencing severe nausea or vomiting and 30% of patients experiencing extreme heat sensation.

First, the relationship between simultaneous digital angiography and intracoronary Doppler velocity measurements was determined in 61 patients. The correlation coefficient for 233 simultaneous pairs of papaverine-induced flow reserve was 0.70 (Doppler = 0.41 digital + 0.93, P less than 0.0001). Repeated basal flow determinations showed little variability (Doppler: 2 +/- 5% (mean +/- 95% confidence intervals); digital: 3 +/- 10%). Repeated hyperemic flow estimates by the Doppler technique were more reproducible (10 +/- 2%) than those by the digital method (26 +/- 6%). Second, estimates of coronary flow reserve by side-mounted and end-mounted Doppler catheters were compared in vitro and in patients. In vitro measurement of blood velocity was linear for both catheter designs and was highly correlated with volume flow determined by electromagnetic flow meter (r = 0.99 side-mounted; r = 0.96 end-mounted). In patients (n = 20), average coronary flow reserve for the side-mounted Doppler crystal was 2.64 +/- 0.15 and for the end-mounted Doppler crystal was 2.40 +/- 0.14 (P less than 0.02). When flow reserve was determined twice for each catheter, there was greater variability in repeated measurements using the side-mounted Doppler crystal (21 +/- 10%, n = 14) than using the end-mounted Doppler crystal (12 +/- 4%, n = 32).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin-1 is a 21-amino acid endothelial vasoconstrictor peptide that may be the physiological antagonist of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Endothelin-1 (10(-11)-3 x 10(-7) M) evoked potent contractions of isolated internal mammary arteries, internal mammary veins, and saphenous veins, which were enhanced in internal mammary veins as compared with internal mammary arteries (concentration shift, 6.3-fold; p less than 0.05) but not in the saphenous veins. Endothelial removal augmented the response to the peptide (at 3 x 10(-7) M) in internal mammary arteries (p less than 0.05) but not in veins. In the artery, EDRF released by acetylcholine or bradykinin reversed endothelin-1-induced contractions; in saphenous veins, both agonists were much less effective compared with the artery and veins contracted with norepinephrine (p less than 0.005-0.01). This inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxations in veins occurred at half-maximal contractions but was most prominent at maximal contractions to the peptide. Nitric oxide similarly inhibited contractions to endothelin-1 and norepinephrine in internal mammary arteries, whereas in veins that were contracted with endothelin-1 but not with norepinephrine, the relaxations were blunted (p less than 0.005). The nitric oxide donor SIN-1 and sodium nitroprusside induced complete relaxations of internal mammary arteries but were less effective in veins contracted with endothelin-1 (p less than 0.005). Thus, in normal human arteries, EDRF inhibits endothelin-1-induced contractions, whereas the peptide specifically attenuates the effects of EDRF and nitrovasodilators in veins. This may be important in pathological conditions associated with increased levels of endothelin-1 and in veins used as coronary bypass grafts.\r"

To study how ACE inhibition suppresses cardiac Ang II formation in man, we characterized ACE-dependent and ACE-independent Ang II-forming pathways in eight normal and 24 failing human hearts obtained at cardiac transplantation. Ang II-forming activity in left ventricular (LV) membrane preparations was assessed by measuring the conversion of [125I]angiotensin I (Ang I) to [125I]Ang II.

Accordingly, isolated perfused hearts (Langendorff preparation) of 300-day-old cardiomyopathic hamsters (a model of spontaneous cardiomyopathy) and age-matched normal hamsters (controls) were infused with Ang I in the presence of captopril; propranolol was added to the perfusing medium to block catecholamine-mediated effects of angiotensins on the heart. Left ventricular developed pressure and the rate of increase in left ventricular developed pressure increased significantly (p less than 0.001) in both the cardiomyopathic and the normal hamster heart despite concomitant reduction in myocardial flow rate favoring a direct inotropic effect of Ang I in both normal and myopathic hearts; these changes were significantly higher by almost threefold in the cardiomyopathic than in the normal hamsters (p less than 0.01) and were blocked by the angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II. Comparing dose-left ventricular contractility response curves for Ang I and Ang II, ED50 for responses was identical in both normal and myopathic hearts, whereas peak responses to Ang II were double those to Ang I in normal hearts but were almost identical in the myopathic hearts.

  ".W": "The effect of ischemia on cholinergic presynaptic inhibition of exocytotic norepinephrine release was studied in the innervated perfused rat heart. In normoxic hearts, vagal nerve stimulation significantly reduced exocytotic norepinephrine overflow to 75% of control values. This inhibitory effect was not affected by 3 minutes of low-flow ischemia (67% of control overflow values), but was attenuated or abolished by 10-minute low-flow ischemia or by 1-, 3-, and 5-minute stop-flow ischemia (107%, 85%, 101%, and 120% of control overflow values, respectively). The alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine could completely or partly restore the failure of vagally induced inhibition of norepinephrine overflow in hearts with 1-, 3-, and 5-minute stop-flow ischemia (72%, 73%, and 85% of control overflow values, respectively). The muscarinic agonist methacholine substantially inhibited norepinephrine overflow to 18% of control overflow values in normoxic hearts. This effect was also significantly attenuated by 10-minute low-flow ischemia or by 1-, 3-, and 5-minute stop-flow ischemia (46%, 38%, 53%, and 55% of control overflow values, respectively). The cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine did not restore the methacholine-induced inhibition of norepinephrine overflow after 3-minute stop-flow ischemia to normoxic level (55% vs. 17%). These results indicate that myocardial ischemia interferes with endogenous and exogenous cholinergic presynaptic inhibition of norepinephrine overflow in the rat heart. The extent of this attenuation depends on the severity and duration of ischemia. Reduced exocytotic acetylcholine release, which is at least in part due to an enhanced adrenergic presynaptic modulation, and dysfunction of presynaptic muscarinic receptors are suggested as two possible mechanisms.\r"

The effect did not occur with exposure of the cells to a variety of other vasoactive agents, calcium ionophore, phorbol ester, or cyclic GMP. The cyclic AMP-induced configurational change was completely inhibited by 2.5 mM N-phenylanthranilic acid or 145 mM sodium gluconate (Cl- channel inhibitors) and was partially inhibited by 2.5 mM 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS), but it was not affected by deprivation of Ca2+ or Na+ ion, 1 mM bumetanide (Cl- cotransport inhibitor), 1 mM amiloride (Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor), 0.1 mM verapamil (Ca2+ channel inhibitor), or 5 mM BaCl2 (K+ channel inhibitor), by change in cellular pH, or by pertussis toxin. Trifluoperazine (calmodulin inhibitor, 50 microM), 1 mM EGTA plus 100 microM 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)octyl ester (TMB-8, intracellular Ca2+ antagonist), and 5 microM cytochalasin B also produced cellular retraction, but these changes were not blocked by chloride channel inhibition. In the presence of 0.1 mM ouabain plus 0.1 mM bumetanide, 36Cl- uptake was decreased by isoproterenol plus isobutylmethylxanthine while its efflux was enhanced. N-Phenylanthranilic acid inhibited the stimulated efflux. We conclude that cyclic AMP induces a configurational change of endothelial cells that is related to Cl- efflux from the cells; the cellular effects may play a role in vascular function.\r"

  ".W": "Although morphological studies suggest that coronary vascular injury is a result of prolonged ischemia and subsequent reperfusion, whether functional coronary microvascular injury develops during brief in vivo ischemia is unclear. In other organs, permeability is a sensitive indicator of functional vascular injury. Therefore, a new double-indicator method of assessing vascular protein permeability, a method that is both sensitive and specific for vascular injury, was used to investigate the effects of ischemia of graded duration followed by reperfusion on coronary microvascular function. To help confirm functional coronary vascular injury, endothelium-dependent vasodilation of isolated coronary vascular rings also was examined. Microvascular permeability was quantitatively assessed as a protein leak index by measuring the rate of extravascular accumulation of radiolabeled protein (indium 113m transferrin) normalized for vascular surface area (technetium 99m erythrocytes). Anesthetized dogs underwent 0 (control), 15, 30, or 60 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Even 15 minutes of ischemia increased the protein leak index by 50% (3.16 +/- 0.30 ischemic vs. 2.09 +/- 0.11 control). Longer periods of ischemia increased the protein leak index in proportion to the duration of ischemia. The protein leak index increased threefold (6.51 +/- 0.60) after 60 minutes of ischemia. At each duration of ischemia, there was significant regional variation in the protein leak index that correlated with the severity of ischemic blood flow to that region measured with microspheres. Endothelial injury also was evident after 15 and 30 minutes of ischemia as impaired vasodilation of isolated coronary rings in response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and the calcium ionophore A23187. Electron microscopy and in vitro direct immunofluorescence revealed evidence of vascular injury after 60 minutes but not after 15 minutes of ischemia. We conclude that even brief ischemia and reperfusion cause functional coronary vascular injury evident as increased microvascular permeability and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation and that regional differences in the degree of microvascular injury correlate with differences in the severity of ischemia.\r"

  ".U": "90200103\r", 
  ".W": "An acute myocardial infarction, particularly one that is large and transmural, can produce alterations in the topography of both the infarcted and noninfarcted regions of the ventricle. This remodeling can importantly affect the function of the ventricle and the prognosis for survival. In the early period, infarct expansion has been recognized by echocardiography as a lengthening of the noncontractile region. The noninfarcted region also undergoes an important lengthening that is consistent with a secondary volume-overload hypertrophy and that can be progressive. The extent of ventricular enlargement after infarction is related to the magnitude of the initial damage to the myocardium and, although an increase in cavity size tends to restore stroke volume despite a persistently depressed ejection fraction, ventricular dilation has been associated with a reduction in survival. The process of ventricular enlargement can be influenced by three interdependent factors, that is, infarct size, infarct healing, and ventricular wall stresses. A most effective way to prevent or minimize the increase in ventricular size after infarction and the consequent adverse effect on prognosis is to limit the initial insult. Acute reperfusion therapy has been consistently shown to result in a reduction in ventricular volume. The reestablishment of blood flow to the infarcted region, even beyond the time frame for myocyte salvage, has beneficial effects in attenuating ventricular enlargement. The process of scarification can be interfered with during the acute infarct period by the administration of glucocorticosteroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, which result in thinner infarcts and greater degrees of infarct expansion. Modification of distending or deforming forces can importantly influence ventricular enlargement. Even short-term augmentations in afterload have deleterious long-term effects on ventricular topography. Conversely, judicious use of nitroglycerin seems to be associated with an attenuation of infarct expansion and long-term improvement in clinical outcome. Long-term therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor can favorably alter the loading conditions on the left ventricle and reduce progressive ventricular enlargement as demonstrated in both experimental and clinical studies. With the former therapy, this attenuation of ventricular enlargement was associated with a prolongation in survival. The long-term clinical consequences of long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy after myocardial infarction is currently being evaluated. Although studies directed at attenuating left ventricular remodeling after infarction are in the early stages, it does seem that this will be an important area in which future research might improve long-term outcome after infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Despite large gains in the medical and surgical treatment of angina pectoris in the past two decades, many patients are refractory to conventional medical therapy and are unsuitable for a first or, more commonly, repeat coronary revascularization procedure. We evaluated the efficacy of perhexiline maleate, a drug with an antianginal mechanism of action in humans that is as yet unknown, by using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design in 17 patients with refractory angina who continued to receive maximal antianginal therapy, typically including nitrates, a beta-blocker, and a calcium channel antagonist. In view of perhexiline's potential for hepatic and neurological toxicity, plasma drug levels were monitored and maintained in the 150-600 ng/ml range. Sixty-three percent of patients were judged perhexiline responders by objective exercise testing criteria, as compared with 18% of patients on placebo (p less than 0.05). By blinded review of subjective measures of anginal frequency and severity, 65% of patients noted an improvement while on perhexiline, whereas no patient identified the placebo phase with improvement. Side effects observed in 29% of patients were minor and related to transient elevations of blood levels of more than 600 ng/ml; no patient suffered hemodynamic or cardiac conduction abnormalities attributable to perhexiline. With attention to the pharmacokinetics of perhexiline's elimination in individual patients, this novel antianginal agent seems to be safe and effective and deserves further evaluation in patients already receiving maximal antianginal therapy who are not candidates for revascularization procedures.\r"

  ".W": "During acute rejection, coronary vascular reserve is severely impaired in human orthotopic heart transplants. To evaluate the effects of rejection therapy on coronary vascular reserve, the ratio of peak-to-resting coronary flow velocity was assessed with a coronary Doppler catheter and a maximally vasodilating dose of intracoronary papaverine (12 mg) in nine allograft recipients without rejection (group 1) and in six recipients before and after treatment of an acute episode of rejection (group 2). All the patients had normal epicardial coronary arteries and were free of left ventricular hypertrophy. In group 2 during rejection, the coronary vascular reserve was significantly lower than in group 1, in which all the patients had a peak-to-resting coronary flow velocity ratio greater than 4 (2.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.8, respectively, p less than 0.001). In group 2 after treatment of rejection, the peak-to-resting coronary flow velocity ratio was similar to that of group 1 (4.7 +/- 0.8). Heart rate, left ventricular volumes and pressures, hemoglobin concentration, and arterial oxygen pressure were similar in the two groups. This study provides evidence that alterations of coronary vascular reserve because of acute rejection were reversible after treatment of the rejection episode.\r"

  ".U": "90200125\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the effects of long-term pressure overload on regional myocardial substrate use, we performed quantitative autoradiography using 2-deoxy-D-[U-14C]glucose (14C-DG) and beta-methyl[1-14C]heptadecanoic acid (14C-BMHDA) in conscious rats with a 10-week ascending aortic constriction. Heart weight/body weight ratio increased by 27% in aortic-constricted rats as compared with sham-operated rats (p less than 0.01). Myocardial 14C-DG uptake increased (258 +/- 63 vs. 144 +/- 41 nCi/g, p less than 0.01, n = 6 for each group); however, 14C-BMHDA extraction decreased (251 +/- 69 vs. 342 +/- 75 nCi/g, p less than 0.05, n = 7 for each group) in aortic-constricted rats as compared with sham-operated rats. In sham-operated rats, both 14C-DG and 14C-BMHDA uptakes were higher in the left ventricular anterior and lateral walls as compared with the posterior wall or the interventricular septum. In aortic-constricted rats, 14C-DG uptake also increased in the interventricular septum, as well as in the left ventricular anterior and lateral walls, as compared with the posterior wall. There was, however, no regional difference in 14C-BMHDA extraction among these four regions. Myocardial blood flow distribution determined by 4-[N-methyl-14C]iodoantipyrine or myocyte width showed no regional variations among the four regions, either in aortic-constricted or sham-operated rats. Regional interstitial fibrosis was small in either group. The present study suggests that myocardial substrate uptake is altered nonhomogeneously, and that the nonhomogeneity is not because of regional variations in blood flow distribution, myocyte hypertrophy, or interstitial fibrosis. The results of angiotensin II-induced acute pressure overloading in other sham-operated rats, in which a remarkable increase in myocardial 14C-BMHDA extraction (n = 3, p less than 0.01) and no difference in 14C-DG uptake (n = 3) as compared with normotensive sham-operated rats were elicited, suggest that the findings in aortic-constricted rats are not direct responses to increased left ventricular pressure itself but rather should be explained by still unknown factors related to prolonged pressure overload.\r"

A rise in serum concentrations of potassium (from 4.0 +/- 0.3 to 4.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/l; p less than 0.005) and a concomitant fall in serum concentrations of sodium (from 142.7 +/- 1.0 to 139.5 +/- 2.3 mmol/l; p less than 0.05) was seen in each subject. Plasma concentrations of renin, aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic factor did not change during the infusion of endothelin-1. Thus, in the doses used, endothelin-1 induces a rise in blood pressure and serum potassium concentrations.\r"

Ninety asymptomatic shoulders of a comparable age had ultrasonography to serve as a control group. All controls had normal ultrasonograms with no hypoechoic or sonolucent areas. The 50 symptomatic shoulder patients had the following: 28 had a normal arthrogram with either normal ultrasonograms or buckling of the supraspinatus tendon; eight had normal arthrograms, but ultrasonography indicated a thin (less than 4 mm) irregular supraspinatus tendon; 11 had complete rotator cuff tears visualized on both arthrography and ultrasonography (nine of these 11 patients had surgery confirming complete tears in all); two had a false-positive sonogram, and one had a false-negative sonogram. Thus, the ultrasonography's overall positive predictive value to detect a full-thickness rotator cuff tear was 85%, its negative predictive value was 97%, its sensitivity was 92%, and its specificity was 95%. Real-time ultrasonography is a diagnostically sensitive and specific noninvasive method to evaluate patients with shoulder impingement syndrome, leading to the recommendation that it be used as a primary imaging technique to obviate or supplement arthrography in evaluating rotator cuff disease. However, static ultrasonographic pictures, without real-time ultrasonography as a supplement, were not helpful.\r"

There has been little success at producing such a model, however, because there is no frequently occurring natural disease in animals and, after experimental injury, the animals tend to die or recover. Spasticity in animals or humans is one of the many manifestations of an upper motor neuron syndrome; there is no such thing as pure spasticity. Spasticity in animals and humans involves abnormal functions at many levels of the neurologic and muscular systems. Animal models of spasticity may not be directly applicable to human spasticity, because the animal brain is so different from the human brain. Genetically spastic mice are a homogeneous population that have an abnormally functioning neurotransmitter within the central nervous system. This model has been shown to develop abnormalities of muscle growth that ultimately lead to contracture. The spastic mouse shows some promise for investigation of the abnormalities of muscles and joints that occur in spastic humans.\r"

New technological advances in surgical technique, tissue preparation, light and electron microscopy, tissue culture, immunology, and imaging allow a better appreciation of this complex function of growing bone. The differing functions and environments of each of the areas of the physis are becoming clear. The resting zone is one of protein synthesis and physical structure. The proliferative zone appears to be the area that propels the physis by ordered, rapid cell duplication. The hypertrophic zone readies the physis for calcification by sequestering calcium and producing calcium-tolerating Type X collagen. The degenerative zone is very active in the process of calcification of the cartilage matrix by releasing calcium into the matrix and stimulating metaphyseal vascular ingrowth and collagen breakdown. Control of growth of the physis seems to come from both systemic (active in the proliferative zone) and local (active in the hypertrophic zone) growth factors.\r"

Clinically, 12 cases of malignancy have been reported previously in association with orthopedic implants; of these, four were malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFH). This report describes an additional case of MFH occurring in a patient who had multiple hip arthroplasties over a period of 15 years. While 13 malignancies associated with orthopedic implants could certainly be coincidental in view of the vast number of implanted orthopedic devices, each incidence of malignancy associated with an implant should be considered significant in determining any meaningful trends and relationships.\r"

For further assessment of the patient after careful physical examination, myoneural nerve blocks and dynamic electromyography are useful. Physical and occupational therapists have an important role as crucial links among parents, patients, and physicians. Surgeons can try to prevent deformity with splints; however, their use in prevention of deformities of the hand has not been validated by scientific studies. Shoulder deformities can be managed with myotomies, tendon transfers, and (if fixed) osteotomies; rarely is arthrodesis used. Elbow flexion and dynamic or fixed deformities greater than 60 degrees are treated by lengthening of the muscles and tendons. Pronation deformities of the forearm are managed by myotomies, lengthenings, and tendon transfers. Wrist flexion deformities can be corrected with tendon lengthenings and transfers. The best results have been obtained with transfer of the flexor carpi ulnaris to the extensor digitorum communis. Finger flexion deformities can be managed satisfactorily with Z-lengthenings of the flexor digitorum superficialis in the forearm; rarely is it necessary to lengthen the flexor digitorum profundus. For adduction deformity of the thumb, division of the proximal or distal insertions of the adductor pollicis and release of the first dorsal interosseus muscle from the first and second metacarpals are preferred.\r"

  ".W": "1. Mucolytic (mucus solubilizing) activity in human faeces has been characterized with both purified human and pig colonic mucin and shown to be mediated by proteolysis. 2. Mucolytic activity was demonstrated by: (i) a drop in mucin viscosity; (ii) a substantial reduction in mucin size, from polymer to degraded subunit, as assessed by Sepharose CL-2B gel filtration; (iii) formation of new N-terminal peptides. 3. Mucolytic activity was also followed in faecal extracts by its proteolytic activity using standard succinyl albumin substrate. Proteolysis extended over the pH range 4.5-11.0. Proteolysis was inhibited at pH 7.5 by soybean trypsin inhibitor and phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, suggesting the presence of serine proteinases. 4. The polyacrylate carbomer (934P) inhibited both mucolysis of pig colonic mucin and proteolysis of succinyl albumin. 5. Interaction between the polyacrylate (carbomer 934P) and purified human and pig colonic mucin was demonstrated by a marked synergistic increase in solution viscosity (360% above control). 6. The results demonstrate the presence of a mucolytic activity in the human colonic lumen that has the potential to degrade the mucus barrier, and that polyacrylates inhibit this mucolysis and interact to strengthen the colonic mucus barrier. Polyacrylates may therefore have therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease where luminal proteolytic activity can be raised.\r"

  ".W": "1. To investigate mechanisms of extrarenal buffering in uraemic acidosis, we studied the effects of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, in normal subjects and in patients with end-stage kidney disease on maintenance haemodialysis with virtually no urine output. 2. Acetazolamide (500 mg) was administered daily for 7 days, after pretreatment for 1 month with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12); only placebo was administered to a third group (n = 12) of haemodialysis patients. In addition, acetazolamide was administered to normal control subjects (n = 12). 3. Treatment with acetazolamide resulted in a more marked metabolic acidosis in haemodialysis patients than in normal control subjects and the effect in haemodialysis patients was attenuated by prior treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. 4. The administration of acetazolamide to haemodialysis patients led to an increase in serum inorganic phosphorus, bone isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone, and a reduction in serum calcium, whereas acetazolamide had no effect on these variables in normal subjects. In contrast, in the haemodialysis patients previously treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, acetazolamide increased serum inorganic phosphorus, bone isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone and serum calcium. 5. We hypothesize that the metabolic acidosis induced by acetazolamide in haemodialysis patients may result from interference with the mechanisms of extrarenal buffering. 6. As parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and carbonic anhydrase are thought to be involved in bone buffering, we suggest that the marked acidosis seen in haemodialysis patients treated with acetazolamide may be due to impaired parathyroid hormone-mediated bone buffering.\r"

Neither common carotid blood flow nor diastolic blood flow as index of global cerebral perfusion as measured by pulsed Doppler changed.

This instrument has capacity for independent assessment of volumetric flow, as it determines flow cross-section area, stroke length, and pulse rate from the Doppler signals alone. The method is practically independent of the angle of interrogation. We used this device and obtained noninvasive estimates of cardiac output in 54 patients undergoing invasive assessment of cardiac output by thermodilution, Fick, or indicator dye methods (x). Correlations against pooled cardiac output reference standards ranged from r = .86 (y = .86x + 1.03) in 26 studies of high confidence to r = .45 (y = .30x + 2.62) in 17 studies under difficult conditions. The overall correlation was r = .68 (y = .63x + 1.49, n = 87). Noninvasive results of experienced and inexperienced operators were similar (r = .87). The instrument returned accurate assessments of heart rate (r = .83), but underestimated stroke length (r = .72) and appeared to be limited in the assessment of aortic diameters less than 28 or greater than 31 mm (r = .23). We conclude that stand-alone Doppler assessment of cardiac output is appealing and feasible, but difficult or impossible in many ICU scenarios. Further evolution of the concentric beam Doppler approach is needed and anticipated.\r"

The two-beam pulsed Doppler method enables one device to measure simultaneously both aortic blood velocity and aortic diameter. Each observer was blind to the other's measurement and to the thermodilution cardiac output measurement (Qttd). Linear regression of the mean of both observer's QtDopp on Qttd showed QtDopp = 0.90.Qttd + 0.01 (see = 1.54 L/min, r = .90). Bias (+/- SD), defined as mean (QtDopp - Qttd) difference, was -0.69 +/- 1.55 L/min. Interobserver agreement was more variable in patients than volunteers; mean (observer 1 - observer 2) difference was 0.14 +/- 1.30 L/min in ICU patients and -0.09 +/- 0.92 L/min in volunteers. Two-beam pulsed Doppler ultrasound is a simpler method of measuring QtDopp than previous pulsed Doppler methods which measure separately the aortic diameter by echocardiography. Although its agreement with Qttd is close to other Doppler methods and has acceptable interobserver reproducibility, its accuracy remains operator-dependent.\r"

At the time of gallstone detection, 14 patients (10%) had symptoms attributable to cholelithiasis. Over the next five years, only 15 patients (11%) developed episodes resembling biliary pain. Nine patients underwent cholecystectomy during this period. Three of the cholecystectomies were incidental to other abdominal procedures. Two cholecystectomies were performed as emergencies for gallstone complications with no perioperative mortality. Interestingly, 54 patients (40%) with coincidental gallstones died during the follow-up period. All the deaths were unrelated to gallstones. These data indicate that ultrasonographically detected coincidental gallstones rarely have clinical significance, leading strong support to the expectant management of most patients with purely coincidental gallstones.\r"

  ".W": "In the period 1985-1988, 62 focal liver lesions in 58 cirrhotic patients were studied by ultrasonography; 12 of these focal lesions were documented to be regenerating lesions by echo-guided fine-needle biopsy. During an average follow-up period of 10.2 months (range 3-22 months), hepatocellular carcinoma was subsequently found in 10 of the cases of regenerating nodules, whereas the initial diagnosis of regenerating nodule was confirmed in the remaining two cases. Based upon this finding, it is suggested that every focal mass visualized by ultrasonography in a cirrhotic liver should either be considered to be a neoplastic lesion or at least a preneoplastic lesion if the possibility of either a metastatic or benign lesion (eg, hemangiomas, focal fatty liver change areas) can be excluded. Therefore either fine-needle aspiration or biopsy of all ultrasonographically revealed mass lesions within a cirrhotic liver is advised, such that early appropriate treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma can be instituted.\r"

To determine if GR 38032F, a selective 5HT3 antagonist known to have antiemetic effects, influences colonic transit in health, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed. Using a radiopaque marker technique, colonic transit was quantified in 39 healthy volunteers (19 men, 20 nonpregnant women) 18-70 years of age. On a standard 25-g fiber diet, 16 mg of GR 38032F was given orally thrice daily. Gastrointestinal peptides (peptide YY, human pancreatic polypeptide, neurotensin, motilin, gastrin-cholecystokinin, substance P) were also measured in plasma fasting and postprandially. Mean total colonic transit time on placebo was 27.8 hr, while on GR 38032F it was 39.1 hr (P less than 0.0005). Transit times through the left colon (P less than 0.0005) and rectosigmoid (P less than 0.05) were prolonged by the drug, but right colonic transit was not significantly altered. Transit times did not correlate with age or gender, but subjects with shorter transit times were significantly more affected than were those with longer transit times. The peak release of peptide YY was minimally decreased following GR 38032F (P less than 0.01), but the peak and integrated postprandial responses of human pancreatic polypeptide, neurotensin, motilin, gastrin-cholecystokinin, and substance P were not significantly altered by the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clinical presentations in each was suggestive of malignancy with extension to either serosa and/or lymph nodes. Metastasis to liver was present in two patients. Histologically, the tumor showed glands with surface microvilli resembling adenocarcinoma and also organoid pattern with neurosecretory granules in cells resembling carcinoid. Two patients died three and nine months after surgery.

We compared a cholesterol-free tofu-based frozen dessert (TFD) containing high-fructose corn syrups with a dairy-based sucrose-sweetened ice cream (IC). Six male and six female non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients (mean age 51 yr, mean ideal body weight 143%, fasting blood glucose less than 160 mg/dl) with well-controlled diabetes and managed on oral hypoglycemic agents were studied. Subjects underwent three trials. In the first trial they ingested 50 g glucose, and in the next two trials they ingested 50-g carbohydrate equivalents of either TFD or IC in random sequence. Venous blood was drawn at intervals during the 3-h trials for glucose and insulin determinations. Fasting plasma glucose was not statistically different between IC and TFD trials (130 vs. 121 mg/dl). Peak glucose responses were at 120 min in both trials (190 mg/dl for IC and 222 mg/dl for TFD), with those for TFD being significantly higher (P less than 0.01). Mean glucose area and glycemic index for TFD were significantly greater than for IC (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.03, respectively). There was no significant difference between mean insulin areas. In summary, the TFD, which contains soybean curd and high-fructose corn syrup, might have been expected to produce more satisfactory postprandial blood glucose levels than IC, which contains sucrose, yet a higher glycemic response was elicited. This is related to the substantial amount of total glucose in this \"fructose\" dessert.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Experimental patients practiced an algorithm for adjustment of insulin dosage based on daily prebreakfast capillary blood glucose (CBG) measurements and any symptomatic hypoglycemia. At 2-, 4-, and 6-mo visits, records of CBG measurements were available to the physicians (n = 7), who changed insulin dosages of both groups ad libitum. Feasibility of the experimental treatment is evidenced by study completion by 87% of enrollers, monitoring on 88% of days, accuracy of CBG recording (recorded as percentage of memory meter value, 100.8), weight gain not exceeding that of control subjects, practice of treatment algorithm to effect changes in insulin dosage, modest increase in frequency of mild insulin reactions, and a decrease of glycosylated hemoglobin into the normal range.\r"

  ".W": "Adjustment algorithms for conventional insulin therapy must be tested for safety and efficacy before clinical implementation. We did this by computer simulation. Accordingly, a computer simulator of human intermediary metabolism created 10 randomly chosen diabetic subjects for study. All were well defined with respect to compliance (i.e., medication and diet) and life-style (i.e., physical and emotional stress). Insulin-adjustment algorithms that were tested calculated daily insulin dosages for these computer-simulated patients based on either blood or urine glucose concentrations self-measured 4 times/day before breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime snack. The twofold purpose of the simulation study was to determine the ability of the adjustment algorithms to improve initially poor metabolic control and to compare the outcomes when either blood or urine glucose measurements were the basis on which glycemic control was implemented. A significant improvement in metabolic control could be achieved with either blood or urine glucose measurements as input to the algorithms. Detailed comparisons between blood and urine glucose-based treatments showed no significant advantage of blood glucose-based algorithms at breakfast (122 +/- 21 vs. 131 +/- 16 mg/dl) and dinner (117 +/- 27 vs. 130 +/- 23 mg/dl), whereas mean glycemia at lunch (122 +/- 24 vs. 164 +/- 21 mg/dl) and bedtime (117 +/- 25 vs. 150 +/- 21 mg/dl) after 120 days of simulation did differ significantly (P less than 0.01). Hypoglycemia was not provoked by either treatment. Total daily insulin doses evolved by blood glucose-based algorithms were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than the doses used by urine glucose-based algorithms (53 vs. 47 U).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Urinary excretion of calcium, inorganic phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, and creatinine was measured in first-void spot urine samples collected 4 days apart in 220 insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) children (mean age 11.9 yr) attending a summer camp. A single control urine sample was obtained from 33 healthy nondiabetic siblings (mean age 11.2 yr). Mean +/- SD urinary calcium-creatinine ratios (UCa/Cr) did not significantly differ between IDDM and control subjects (0.14 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.12 +/- 0.09, respectively, P = 0.156). Mean urinary magnesium-creatinine ratios (UMg/Cr) were elevated in IDDM compared with control subjects (0.15 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.03, respectively, P = 0.0001). Similarly, mean urinary phosphorus-creatinine ratios (UP/Cr) were significantly increased over those in control subjects (1.12 +/- 0.33 vs. 0.40 +/- 0.22, respectively, P = 0.0001). UCa/Cr, UMg/Cr, and UP/Cr were correlated with increasing mean urine glucose content (P = 0.0001). No correlations were found when UCa/Cr, UMg/Cr, or UP/Cr were compared with patient age, duration of diabetes, glycosylated hemoglobin, or insulin dosage. Urine losses of phosphorus and magnesium were present even when glycemic control was considered good by several methods (glycosylated hemoglobin, short-term glycemic index, or urinary glucose content). Glomerular hyperfiltration was unable to account for increased urinary mineral content. In conclusion, the data indicate that urinary excretion of phosphorus and magnesium is elevated in children with IDDM, regardless of glycemic control. In the presence of glucosuria, this loss is further enhanced. Urinary calcium excretion is significantly higher only during periods of glucosuria. The data suggest that children with IDDM could be at risk for mineral deficiencies in the absence of intensive insulin management.\r"

  ".W": "Cigarette smoking is the most important preventable cause of illness and death in the United States, responsible for 390,000, or one sixth, of all deaths. Although smoking prevalence has decreased among adults, from 40% in 1965 to 29% in 1987, 49 million Americans continue to smoke. Smoking rates have declined at a slower rate among blacks, women, young people, and the less educated, groups that must be targeted for tobacco use prevention interventions. The clinician is uniquely positioned to reduce the enormous health toll from cigarette smoking. As a first step, physicians are urged to assess tobacco use during every patient visit by making smoking status a new vital sign. Although 85% of all smokers quit on their own, physicians can greatly facilitate this process. A brief intervention for physicians to help their smoking patients quit, based on a program of the National Cancer Institute, is presented. This program includes asking about smoking status during every clinic visit, advising all smoking patients to quit, assisting smokers by setting a quit date and using nicotine gum, if appropriate, and arranging follow-up with smokers who try to quit. Cessation rates of 5% to 25%, sustained for at least 1 year, are consistent with a successful, physician-mediated intervention program. Physicians are also urged to prevent smoking initiation among adolescents, particularly young girls and those not aspiring to attend college. Physicians can also reduce the enormous toll of tobacco use by acting at the public health and public policy levels. Recording tobacco use as a contributing or the underlying cause on death certificates, if appropriate, will assist in public health surveillance. Also, clinicians are urged to work at the organizational, community, and governmental levels to promote tobacco-free environments.\r"

  ".U": "90200879\r", 
  ".W": "The role of microtubules in the modulation of secretion of the ovarian protein hormone, relaxin, by porcine large luteal cells (LLCs) was examined by use of a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. In this assay, luteal cells were cocultured in monolayers with protein-A-coupled ovine erythrocytes. In the presence of porcine relaxin antiserum and complement, a zone of hemolysis, a plaque, developed around relaxin-releasing LLCs. The rate of development of plaques in time-course experiments (1-12 h) and the detection of discontinuities in the pattern of plaque formation were used in this study as an index of the rate of relaxin release and a method to detect differential responsiveness of individual LLCs, respectively. Monolayers were bathed in medium containing three different antimicrotubule agents that bind to tubulin and induce microtubule loss through depolymerization. Exposure of luteal cell-containing monolayers to colchicine (100 microM), vinblastine (1 microM), and nocadazole (30 microM) resulted in a reduction in the rate of relaxin-induced plaque formation by LLCs, unequivocal evidence of an inhibitory effect of all three of these antimicrotubule agents of the rate of basal relaxin release. However, this suppressive effect on relaxin release was strictly time related. None of the antimicrotubule agents significantly affected plaque formation until 3 h of incubation. Thereafter, a plateau of plaque formation was observed in antimicrotubule-treated monolayers over approximately 3-8 h of incubation, indicating substantial slowing or cessation of relaxin release by LLCs during this period. During this middle phase of the incubation, plaque formation in antimicrotubule-treated monolayers was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than that in controls. By 8-12 h of incubation plaque formation was still significantly suppressed in vinblastine-treated monolayers, but not, however, in colchicine- or nocadozole-treated monolayers. Treatment with beta-lumicolchicine (100 microM; a form of colchicine that fails to bind to tubulin) resulted in no significant change in the rate of plaque formation compared with that in controls. We conclude that microtubule-assisted transport forms an important intracellular mechanism that assists basal release of an ovarian peptide hormone, relaxin. Moreover, the discontinuity of plaque formation in the middle phase of the incubation is consistent with the view that a subpopulation of LLCs responds preferentially to antimicrotubule agents. However, the exact nature and physiological role(s) of microtubules in the control of relaxin secretion and the interrelationships of microtubules with other intracellular regulatory events remain to be clearly defined.\r"

Chemical cross-linking of [125I]endothelin to rat brain membranes by using the cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) revealed two specific proteins of Mr = 52,000 and Mr = 30,000. The same results were obtained by photoaffinity labeling of [125I]azidoendothelin to rat brain membranes. The labeling of the two proteins was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by unlabeled endothelin but not by unrelated peptides. Peptide map comparisons of the Mr = 52,000 and Mr = 30,000 protein bands using Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and papain revealed that the Mr = 30,000 band is a proteolytic degradation product of the Mr = 52,000.

For this purpose islets were isolated from adult rats which had received an ip injection of SZ (100 mg/kg body weight) on postnatal day 1 or from control rats receiving the solvent only. The islets used were either fresh or after culture for 2, 7, or 14 days in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5.6, 11.1, or 16.7 mM glucose. After the various culture periods determinations were performed of the islet contents of insulin and insulin mRNA and the rates of (pro)insulin biosynthesis and insulin release. Freshly isolated islets from SZ-treated rats exhibited lower contents of insulin and insulin mRNA, a lower rate of (pro)insulin biosynthesis, and an impaired glucose-sensitive insulin release. Similar results were obtained after 2 days of culture, in each of the glucose concentrations. After 7 days of culture, however, the content of insulin mRNA and the rate of (pro)insulin biosynthesis of the SZ islets were restored to the control levels. When such islets were cultured for 7 days in 5.6 mM glucose, they exhibited a glucose-sensitive insulin release similar to that of the control islets. A difference in the insulin release between the two groups nevertheless persisted after culture for 7 days at either 11.1 and 16.7 mM glucose. Also, after 14 days of culture at 16.7 mM glucose there was an impaired glucose-sensitive insulin release from SZ islets, while islets cultured at 11.1 mM glucose showed a glucose-stimulated insulin release similar to that of the controls. The present data indicate that, as far as storage and biosynthesis of insulin is concerned, the functional aberrations observed in the freshly isolated SZ-islets did not reflect a permanent cytotoxic damage. The persistent impairment of insulin release after culture at 16.7 mM glucose may reflect either an injurious effect of the mildly diabetic metabolism in vivo or of the neonatal streptozotocin injection.\r"

ET-1 (10(-11)-10(-6) M) did not alter basal aldosterone release from adrenal glomerulosa cells. However, both angiotensin-II (AII)- and ACTH-stimulated aldosterone release from these cells. ET-1 enhanced ACTH-stimulated aldosterone release over a range of concentrations. This enhancement was observed at a threshold of 0.1 nM ET-1. Similar responses were observed in incubations of 1- and 2-h duration. In contrast, AII-stimulated aldosterone release was not altered by ET-1. ET-1 also enhanced aldosterone release in cells stimulated with 8-bromo-cAMP. All increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations in fura-2-loaded cells; however, ET-1 alone or with ACTH had no effect. In addition, chronic treatment of cells with ACTH for 2 days caused an enhanced release of aldosterone in cells acutely treated with ET-1 compared to cells not acutely treated (62% over chronic ACTH control; P less than 0.05). However, chronic treatment of ET-1 did not alter aldosterone secretion in the acute incubation compared to that in chronic controls. Thus, both acute and chronic exposures to ACTH sensitize glomerulosa cells to stimulation by ET-1. ET-1 did not alter basal or ACTH-stimulated cortisol release from adrenal fasciculata cells. Thus, the actions of ET-1 appear to be specific for glomerulosa cells. These data indicate that ET may exert a direct effect on adrenal glomerulosa cells to enhance ACTH-stimulated aldosterone release.\r"

Medium supplements examined included proteose peptone (PP), transferrin (TrFe), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), an insulinotropic fragment of human GH [hGH-(6-13)], ethanolamine (EA), phosphoethanolamine (PEA), and human serum albumin (HSA). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from islet monolayers was determined after culture in serum-free supplemented medium by either 2- to 3-h static incubations or in a superfusion system with either low (2.8-8.3 mM) or stimulatory (16.7-19.4 mM) glucose concentrations. Glucose-induced secretion was not sustained after 3-4 days of culture in medium supplemented with PP (0.5 mg/ml) and TrFe (10 micrograms/ml) alone. Addition of T3 did not restore glucose-induced secretion, although a combination of T3 and IGF-I or of T3, IGF-I, and PRL (10(-10)-10(-9) M) maintained glucose-induced insulin secretion for 1 month. No beneficial effects were noted with hGH-(6-13). The beta-cell lines HIT-T15 and RINr 1046-38 were used to screen for a potential replacement for PP, the undefined component of the serum-free medium. A combination of HSA (1 mg/ml), EA (50 microM), and PEA (50 microM) provided a replacement for PP. In fact, insulin secretion from HIT-T15 cells was significantly better after culture in medium supplemented with HSA, EA, PEA, TrFe, T3, IGF-I, and PRL than in medium with PP, TrFe, T3, IGF-I, and PRL. HSA (1 mg/ml), EA (50 microM), and PEA (50 microM) in combination with TrFe (10 micrograms/ml), T3 (0.1 nM), IGF-I (0.65 nM), and PRL (1 nM) were used in studies with primary islet monolayers. After 3 weeks of culture islet monolayers were superfused, and the biphasic glucose-induced insulin secretion of cells maintained in defined medium was indistinguishable from the insulin secretion of cells maintained in medium with 5% fetal bovine serum. These studies indicate that adult rat beta-cells retain biphasic glucose-induced insulin secretion after extended culture in defined serum-free medium. The defined medium was also useful for cultures of RINr 1046-38 and HIT-T15 cells and should provide a basis for formulating media for islet cells from higher mammals, including man.\r"

  ".W": "ACTH, like other anterior pituitary peptide hormones, is secreted episodically and demonstrates both circadian and ultradian rhythms. CRH is the major regulator of ACTH release from the pituitary corticotroph. To determine the dependence of ACTH ultradian rhythms on CRH, passive immunoneutralization was used to block the activity of endogenous CRH in rats with indwelling venous catheters. Blood was sampled at 2- and 15-min intervals while blood volume was replaced. Plasma ACTH was measured by RIA. Time-series analysis of plasma ACTH concentrations was performed with PULSAR and Cluster Analysis. The 2 min data demonstrated secretory bursts approximately every 20 min. CRH immunoneutralization had no effect on the frequency of these pulses, but significantly reduced their amplitude. This was the case for raw data as well as data in which lower frequency variation had been filtered out. The 15 min data demonstrated pulsatile secretion, with a secretory episode approximately every 100 min. This lower frequency rhythm was also observed when high frequency components were filtered out of the 2 min data series. Analysis of the 15 min and the filtered 2 min time series showed this rhythm to be almost totally ablated by CRH immunoneutralization. These results suggest that CRH is responsible for amplitude modulation of an underlying CRH-independent rhythm and that through intermittent amplitude modulation of this rhythm a lower frequency rhythm is generated. Comparison between treatment groups of pulses identified by PULSAR or Cluster Analysis yielded similar results, but the programs were discordant with each other. This is the first in vivo evidence of pulsatile ACTH secretion independent of CRH, the first report demonstrating that different ultradian rhythms of ACTH may be regulated by different mechanisms, and the first comparison of PULSAR and Cluster Analysis on plasma ACTH time series.\r"

Half of the animals received daily insulin injections to reduce hyperglycemia. After 10 weeks, sarcolemmal membranes were isolated from hindlimb muscles to study glucose transport, and the number of glucose transporters was assessed by cytochalasin-beta binding. Both glucose transport (19.2 +/- 1.6 vs. 31.93 +/- 3.29 pmol/mg protein.15 sec) and cytochalasin-beta binding (3.06 +/- 0.28 vs. 6.14 +/- 0.59 pmol/mg protein) were significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced in the diabetic untreated rats compared to control values. Daily insulin injections restored both (P less than 0.05) basal transport (33.22 +/- 3.62 pmol/mg protein.15 sec) and cytochalasin-beta binding (5.52 +/- 0.66 pmol/mg protein) to control levels. Maximum insulin stimulation (1 U/kg, iv) significantly increased (P less than 0.05) both glucose transport (30.18 +/- 3.76 vs. 96.48 +/- 4.21 pmol/mg protein.15 sec) and cytochalasin-beta binding (4.38 +/- 0.29 vs. 9.40 +/- 0.42 pmol/mg protein) in the untreated diabetic and control rats. However, the stimulation in the untreated diabetic rats only reached basal control levels, which was significantly (P less than 0.05) below the insulin-stimulated value for the controls. In the rats receiving daily insulin injections, maximum insulin stimulation increased (P less than 0.05) both glucose transport (58.67 +/- 15.24 pmol/mg protein.15 sec) and cytochalasin-beta binding (6.4 +/- 0.7 pmol/mg protein), but both transport and binding were significantly (P less than 0.05) below insulin-stimulated values for the control rats. These data show that insulin deficiency adversely affected the glucose transport system in skeletal muscle. Both basal and maximum insulin-stimulated transport and the number of transport molecules were reduced. Daily insulin treatment corrected some of the defects, but maximum insulin stimulation was still significantly below values for control animals.\r"

In comparison with parental RIN-m5F cells, subline A12 displayed a 7.6-fold increase in A2B5 expression and a 3.4-fold increase in the number of A2B5 positive cells (81% vs. 24%). A2B5 expression was increased 1.3-, 5.4-, 5.4-, and 6.9-fold on A4, A6, A7, and A10 sublines, respectively. In contrast, AlGh cells, which had comparable A2B5 expression to parental cells, displayed a 2.9-fold increase in 3G5 expression and an 8-fold increase in the number of 3G5 positive cells (72% vs. 9%). Insulin secretion and content increased with increasing A2B5 expression. On day 2, secretion was 1.2-, 8-, 8-, 21-, and 18-fold higher and content 1.4-, 4-, 5-, 26-, and 33-fold higher for A4, A6, A7, A10, and A12 cells, respectively, compared to parental cells. There was a direct association between expression of A2B5 and the level of insulin messenger RNA (mRNA) in the sublines. Neither glucagon nor somatostatin was detected in any subline. The AlGh subline secreted and contained less insulin than parental cells. Fully differentiated adult rat islet cells, the majority of which are beta-cells, contained a lower number of 3G5 (12%) than A2B5 (57%) positive cells. Compared to parental cells, class I MHC proteins were decreased 4-fold on A12 cells, but increased 1.5-fold on AlGh cells. We conclude that, at least in RIN cells, the expression of A2B5-reactive ganglioside expression is associated directly, and class I MHC protein expression indirectly, with beta-cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid follicles, an essential functional unit of the thyroid, are ball-like structures and exist in the extracellular matrix in vivo. Thus far, the follicles have not been reconstructed in any culture system. The presumed reason for that was that the in vitro environment for the follicle cells in monolayer culture markedly differed from their environment in vivo. We, therefore, considered that isolated follicle cells had to be localized in a three-dimensional environment of extracellular matrix, specifically collagen, to reconstruct thyroid follicles in vitro. At first, follicle cells were completely isolated. These cells were cultured in the three-dimensional collagen gel. An intracytoplasmic cavity first developed in individual cells. A single cell with the cavity then underwent cell division, and the follicle consisting of two cells was reconstructed. This gradually grew to be a large ball-like structure through proliferation of the component cells, and they exhibited morphological polarity specific for thyroid follicle cells. In addition, these cells clearly produced thyroid hormones. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first instance of reconstruction of thyroid follicles in an in vitro culture system. This culture system is more useful than the monolayer culture system in that this system provides a more physiological environment for investigations of differentiation of follicle cells. Further experiments using this method will probably provide a new clue to the mechanism of thyroid folliculogenesis.\r"

Seven ovariectomized rhesus monkeys bearing chronic indwelling third ventricular catheters for peptide infusion were used for these studies. Peripheral blood samples for PRL and LH RIA were obtained every 15 min during a 3-h control period when saline was infused into the ventricle, followed by a 5-h period of peptide infusion at a rate of 25 microliters/h. When beta EP was infused at a dose of 5 micrograms/h, plasma PRL rose from a mean baseline of 3.5 +/- 0.7 ng/ml to a peak of 21.3 +/- 2.2 ng/ml. When the same animals were infused with 20 micrograms alpha MSH together with 5 micrograms beta EP, the peak concentration of PRL was reduced to 8.2 +/- 1.7 ng/ml (P less than 0.001). When a higher dose of beta EP (20 micrograms/h) was infused, PRL rose to a peak of 38.2 +/- 1.8 ng/ml. This response was again markedly blunted, and the peak PRL response was reduced to 7.3 +/- 2.2 ng/ml when 20 micrograms beta EP were infused together with 80 micrograms alpha MSH (P less than 0.001). Analysis of the area under the plasma PRL concentration curves demonstrated a significant reduction in area during the 5-h infusion with beta EP plus alpha MSH compared to that during infusion of beta EP alone. The mean area was reduced from 3480 +/- 570 ng min/ml after 5 micrograms beta EP alone to 1030 +/- 200 after 5 micrograms beta EP plus 20 micrograms alpha MSH and from 6230 +/- 990 after 20 micrograms beta EP to 1020 +/- 320 ng min/ml after 20 micrograms beta EP plus 80 micrograms alpha MSH (P less than 0.01). Des-acetyl alpha MSH (80 micrograms) was also effective in reducing the PRL response to 830 +/- 380 ng min/ml (P less than 0.05). The suppression of pulsatile LH release by beta EP was also attenuated by alpha MSH. During the 5-h infusion of beta EP, total LH secretion was reduced to 65.9 +/- 3.8% of that measured during the 3-h saline infusion compared to 87.2 +/- 2.7% after infusion of beta EP plus alpha MSH (P less than 0.001) or 91.7 +/- 4.1% after beta EP plus des-acetyl alpha MSH (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of vitamin D action on insulin biosynthesis and secretion, we examined preproinsulin (ppI) mRNA levels in the pancreas of normal rats, vitamin D-deficient rats, and rats supplemented with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] or calcium (Ca) for 3 days. The ppI mRNA levels determined by dot blot analysis in vitamin D-deficient, 1,25-(OH)2D3-replete, and Ca-replete rats were 39.1%, 68.7%, and 66.7%, respectively, of values in normal rats. These results concur with previously reported levels of insulin secretion in the perfused rat pancreas. The reduced level of ppI mRNA should lead to a decrease in insulin biosynthesis and, thus, impair insulin secretion in vitamin D-deficient rats. The observed partial recovery of ppI mRNA levels through supplementation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 or Ca may be one mechanism by which insulin secretion is restored in rats after 1,25-(OH)2D3 or Ca repletion. We examined further the time course of ppI mRNA accumulation in rats after a single administration of 1,25-(OH)2D3. When fasting was continued for an additional 24-h period after an overnight fast, ppI mRNA levels were not changed significantly in either vitamin D-deficient or replete rats. However, in the rats that were pair-fed after overnight fasting, ppI mRNA levels in 1,25-(OH)2D3-replete rats increased at 8 and 24 h, whereas ppI mRNA in vitamin D-deficient rats increased only at 24 h. Moreover, the increment at 24 h was significantly larger in 1,25-(OH)2D3-replete rats than in vitamin D-deficient rats. We conclude that 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhances steady state levels of ppI mRNA only under conditions of refeeding and during feeding.\r"

Human placenta contained cAMP PDEs in particulate and cytosolic fractions. More than 99% of the total activity was localized in the cytosolic fraction. The cytosolic fraction exhibited at least four cyclic nucleotide PDEs when fractionated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The first form was a calmodulin-activated PDE which hydrolyzed both cGMP and cAMP. The second form was a high affinity cAMP PDE with a nonlinear kinetic characteristic, but was not inhibited by either cGMP or cilostamide (either compound is known to specifically inhibit rat insulin-sensitive cAMP PDE). The third form was a low Km cAMP PDE, but was only modestly sensitive to inhibition by cGMP or cilostamide. The fourth form was a cAMP PDE which showed high sensitivity to inhibition by cGMP or cilostamide. The IC50 values of the fourth form were comparable to those of rat adipose insulin-sensitive PDE. However, its Km for cAMP was 2 microM, which is about 10 times higher than that of the rat enzyme. Insulin treatment on placenta tissues stimulated at least two PDEs, the third and fourth forms. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe insulin-sensitive cAMP PDEs in the cytosolic fraction of human placenta.\r"

Binding of the MT agonist 2-[125I]iodomelatonin (30 pM to 6 nM) was saturable, of high affinity (Kd, 52.8 pM), of high specificity, and to a single class of sites (binding capacity, 16.5 fmol/mg protein). However, by shortening the washing time for bound and free ligand, we were able to demonstrate an additional low affinity form of this receptor (Kd, 761 pM; binding capacity, 72.2 fmol/mg protein). Micromolar concentrations of guanine nucleotides and millimolar concentrations of monovalent cations (Na+ and Li+) dose-dependently and specifically inhibited agonist binding at 22 C. Saturation studies revealed that this was due to a decrease in receptor affinity in both cases. Ca+2 promoted high affinity agonist binding, as omission of this cation decreased the affinity of the suprachiasmatic MT receptor. These results suggest coupling of the rat suprachiasmatic MT receptors to guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein(s). Moreover, our data demonstrate specific modulation of the affinity of these receptors with cations.\r"

  ".U": "90200926\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1), a polypeptide cytokine secreted by activated macrophages, has been postulated as a chemical messenger between the immune and endocrine systems. IL-1-immunopositive neurons and fibers have been visualized in the human and rat hypothalamus, and IL-1 receptors are present in the rat brain. We have examined the effects of human recombinant IL-1 (alpha- and beta-subtypes) on LH release in vivo and hypothalamic LHRH release in vitro. Ovariectomized rats were primed with estradiol benzoate, and progesterone was injected 48 h later to elicit a LH surge in the afternoon. IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta were injected either intracerebroventricularly (icv) via a preimplanted cannula in the third ventricle of the brain or iv. Systemic injection of IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta (58.8 pmol at 1300 and 1500 h) failed to influence the afternoon LH surge seen in saline-injected control rats. However, IL-1 beta (1.76 pmol) administered icv at 1300 and 1500 h or a single icv injection at 1300 h blocked the progesterone-induced LH surge. Similar icv injections of IL-1 alpha also significantly suppressed the afternoon LH surge compared to that in saline-injected control rats. However, IL-1 alpha was relatively less effective than the beta-subtype, since the LH surge was detected in some rats. To ascertain whether suppression of the LH surge was due to inhibition of LHRH release, the medial basal hypothalamus-preoptic area of estradiol benzoate-progesterone-treated ovariectomized rats was incubated with and without IL-1. Both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, at concentrations of 0.1 nM and higher, significantly suppressed LHRH release in vitro from the medial basal hypothalamus-preoptic area. In contrast, IL-1 (10 nM) was completely ineffective in suppressing LHRH release from the microdissected median eminence. These results demonstrated an overall inhibitory effect of icv IL-1 on the LHRH-LH axis and suggest that suppression of the steroid-induced LH surge by IL-1 may primarily be due to inhibition of LHRH release at hypothalamic sites located within the blood-brain barrier.\r"

In previous studies we found that GLP-I-(7-37) is a potent insulin secretagogue, and its effect was indistinguishable from that of GLP-I-(7-36) amide at concentrations of 10(-11) M. Herein we report insulinotropic effects of additional GLP-I analogs. GLP-I-(7-34) had no stimulatory effect on insulin release at 10(-10) M, but had a partial effect at 10(-9) M and was as active as GLP-I-(7-37) at 10(-8) M. GLP-I-(7-33) had no effect at any concentration tested. GLP-I-(8-37) caused no significant effect on insulin release at 10(-9) and 10(-8) M, but did have an effect at the high concentration of 10(-7) M. Similar results were found with cAMP formation in the beta TC1 line. In this system GLP-I-(7-34) was less potent than GLP-I-(7-37) at a concentration of 5 x 10(-9) M. GLP-I-(7-33) had only about 0.1% the potency of GLP-I-(7-37); thus, there is good agreement between cAMP formation in the beta-cell line and insulin secretion from the perfused pancreas experiments. We conclude that histidine in the 7 position in the N-terminus of GLP-I-(7-37) is crucial for cAMP formation and insulin secretion, and that removal of the last three C-terminus residues of GLP-I-(7-37) results in only partial loss of activity; the residue in the 34 position is, however, essential for the insulinotropic action.\r"

In desensitized cells, acute ACTH effects on aldosterone and cAMP decreased by 25-60%, and diacylglycerol levels and protein kinase-C translocation were persistently stimulated and not substantially affected by further acute ACTH treatment. After 4 h of treatment with 1 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) there were no acute effects of ACTH on the production of aldosterone, cAMP, or diacylglycerol or on protein kinase-C, which was already strongly translocated. These results suggest that ACTH-mediated desensitization of calf adrenal glomerulosa cells may be at least partially mimicked by long term treatment with phorbol esters and could be due to ACTH-induced increases in diacylglycerol-protein kinase-C signaling.\r"

Chronic moderate hyperglycemia did not modify the IRTK activity, despite the presence of in vivo and in vitro insulin resistance. Oral vanadate administration for 3 weeks normalized glucose tolerance and caused a 2.5-fold increase in basal IRTK activity. In contrast, correction of hyperglycemia with phlorizin, an inhibitor of renal glucose reabsorption, did not change the IRTK activity, although glucose tolerance was returned to normal. The vanadate-induced effect on basal IRTK was due to an increase in Vmax of the enzyme; the Km remained unchanged. The insulin-stimulated IRTK activity was not affected by either vanadate or phlorizin treatment. These results suggest that: 1) partial (90%) pancreatectomy in rats causes insulin resistance in the absence of in vitro alterations in IRTK and 2) correction of chronic hyperglycemia with vanadate, but not with phlorizin, is associated with an increased basal activation of the protein tyrosine kinase in liver insulin receptors.\r"

They provide a more accurate and practical means to prospectively predict the time of ovulation than do BBT graphs or cervical mucus exams, and can be used as presumptive evidence of ovulation. Whereas ovulation prediction kits appear to be most useful for couples in timing sexual intercourse, other possible uses exist, including timing of AI, the PCT, and the endometrial biopsy for luteal phase evaluation. Despite multiple potential applications, clinical studies which support the use of urinary LH immunoassays in the evaluation and treatment of the infertile couple are quite limited. More well-designed studies to define the clinical value of ovulation prediction kits need to be undertaken.\r"

Six women (group 1) all of whom had elevated serum testosterone (T) and were less than 5% above their ideal body weight for height underwent IVGTTs. A control group (group 2, n = 5) with equivalent weight and height but normal levels of T were similarly tested. The T values (normal 0.1 to 0.6 ng/mL) in group 1 (0.93 +/- 0.05 ng/mL, mean +/- SEM) were significantly different from those in group 2 (0.34 +/- 0.03 ng/mL). Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the glucose and insulin values. The glucose AUC for group 1 (15,000 +/- 1,100) was not significantly different from the glucose AUC for group 2 (15,853 +/- 788). Interestingly, the insulin AUC for group 1 (3,829 +/- 583) was not significantly different from the insulin AUC for group 2 (2,987 +/- 456). Within group 1, a correlation between serum T and insulin AUC could not be established. We conclude that in these nonobese, nonacanthotic hyperandrogenemic females, although individual variation exists, collectively a significantly increased insulin response to an IVGTT challenge cannot be demonstrated. This data further challenges the concept of androgens being etiologic in insulin resistance.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of low dose immunosuppression with methylprednisolone during the first 4 days after oocyte retrieval on potential immune cell invasion of partially zona dissected embryos in utero was investigated in alternate in vitro fertilization patients (n = 32). The incidence of pregnancy was significantly higher in patients receiving methylprednisolone (7 of 18, 39%) than in control patients (1 of 14, 7%). Twenty-eight percent (11 of 39) of the embryos replaced in the corticosteroid treated patients implanted, whereas only 7% (2 of 31) of embryos in control patients had a fetal heart beat. There were no side effects reported in any of the patients receiving corticosteroids. It can be concluded that methylprednisolone supports implantation of embryos with small holes in their zonae. However, the actual mechanisms of corticosteroid support on the interaction between immune cells and micromanipulated embryos are not well understood.\r"

Fertilization rates improved over controls in the short protocol (P less than 0.001) and fewer couples experienced fertilization failure (P = 0.02). Sixteen pregnancies ensued (30% per collection with the short protocol), and 4 were from cases with less than 1.0 X 10(6) progressively motile sperm count per milliliter, 1 being as low as 0.2 X 10(6) progressively motile count per milliliter. Seventeen healthy infants have now delivered and pregnancy wastage is not increased. Pentoxifylline is thus a useful sperm treatment for cases of male factor infertility.\r"

  ".W": "A pancreatic alpha-like cell line has been established from a glucagonoma arising in transgenic mice expressing a hybrid gene consisting of the rat glucagon-promoter sequence fused to the sequence encoding the SV40 T-antigen oncoprotein. The alpha-tumor cell 1 (alpha TC1) line maintained many characteristics of differentiated alpha-cells for greater than 40 passages in culture and expressed levels of glucagon mRNA 5- to 10-fold higher than those reported previously in rat and hamster islet cell lines. By radioimmunoassay, the cells synthesized considerable amounts of glucagon, glucagonlike peptide I (GLP-I), the major proglucagon fragment, and small amounts of unprocessed proglucagon but no free GLP-II. This distribution of peptides is similar to that found in extracts of rodent pancreases and is distinct from that seen with other islet cell lines, which process proglucagon in patterns more characteristic of intestinal cells. The GLP-I peptide in the alpha TC1 cell line was in the form of GLP-I-(1-37), which is inactive as a stimulator of insulin secretion, and not GLP-I-7-37) or -(7-36)-amide peptides, both of which are potent insulin secretagogues. The alpha TC1 cell line produced glucagon-related peptides in a relatively uniform pattern by immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy revealed typical alpha-type (glucagon) secretory granules. Although the cell line was derived from an islet tumor producing only glucagon, the alpha TC1 cell line also produced insulin in addition to the glucagon peptides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rats were injected with 65 mg/kg streptozocin to induce diabetes and were maintained for 10 days and then treated with or without insulin for the next 5 days. The L-transporter isoform with apparent Mr of 55,000 was observed to be increased approximately twofold in the membranes from liver homogenates of diabetic rats compared with control rats when assessed by Western blot analysis with an anti-peptide antibody directed against rat L-transporter isoform. Insulin treatment of diabetic rats decreased the amount of L-transporter isoform protein toward levels observed in nondiabetic rats. Northern blot analysis demonstrated similar alterations in the rat L-transporter isoform mRNA that paralleled the changes observed in the L-transporter isoform protein. The increased levels of the L-transporter isoform protein and mRNA in diabetic rats are in marked contrast to the effects of insulin deficiency in rat adipocytes, which specifically decrease the amount of the adipocyte glucose-transporter isoform protein and mRNA. These results suggest that glucose-transporter isoforms in rat liver and adipocytes are regulated by different mechanisms and that an increased synthesis of the L-transporter isoform may contribute to the increased glucose output that occurs from the liver during insulin deficiency.\r"

The experiments described herein were designed to determine whether insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation is affected by the free-fatty acid-derived plasma metabolites acetone, acetol, and propylene glycol (1,2-propanediol [1,2-PD]), concentrations of which are elevated in both starvation and diabetic ketosis. In epididymal adipose tissue from fed and 48-h--fasted rats given 3% acetone drinking water for 7 days, insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation was reduced by approximately 30-40%. After ingestion of 2% acetol for 7 days, basal and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation was lowered approximately 30%, whereas the consumption of 1,2-PD had no influence on either basal or insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation. Similar effects on glucose oxidation were observed in isolated adipocytes from fed rats after ingestion of 3% acetone and 2% acetol for 7 days. The reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation in adipose tissue in vitro required the consumption of 3% acetone water for greater than 3 days. In 48-h--fasted rats that ingested 3% acetone for 5 days, insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation remained depressed 4 days after withdrawal of acetone from the drinking water. These studies imply that at least part of the insulin resistance indigenous to fasting and diabetic ketosis may be attributed to the metabolic influence of acetone and/or acetol in body fluids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 5.5 mM glucose, no detectable [3H]glucose was formed. At 16.7 mM, 2.2 patom.islet-1.h-1 of 3H was incorporated into glucose by the control islets and 5.4 patom.islet-1.h-1 by STZ-D islets. About 75% of the 3H was bound to carbon-2 of the glucose. Glucose utilization was 35.3 pmol.islet-1.h-1 by the control and 19.0 pmol.islet-1.h-1 by the STZ-D islets. Therefore, 4.5% of the glucose-6-phosphate formed by the control islets and 15.7% by the STZ-D islets was dephosphorylated. This presumably occurred in the beta-cells of the islets catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase. An increased glucose cycling, i.e., glucose----glucose-6-phosphate----glucose, in islets of STZ-D rats may contribute to the decreased insulin secretion found in these animals.\r"

Diabetic rats were treated with 1 U of long-acting insulin every other day for 12 wk and compared with nondiabetic littermates. Urinary calcium excretion was increased greater than 10-fold, but serum total and diffusible calcium remained normal. Serum concentrations of both 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and vitamin D-binding protein were significantly decreased in diabetic rats. The intestinal calbindin-D 9K concentration was decreased by nearly 50%, and active duodenal calcium absorption was totally abolished. Trabecular bone volume measured in the tibial metaphysis was decreased by 44%, and the osteoblast and osteoid surfaces were less than 10% of values observed in control rats, whereas the osteoclast surface was unchanged by diabetes. The daily bone formation (bone mineral apposition rate) measured by labeling twice with calcein was decreased by 86% in diabetic rats. The serum concentration of osteocalcin, a biochemical marker of osteoblast function, was similarly decreased (mean +/- SE 23 +/- 3 and 62 +/- 4 micrograms/L in diabetic [n = 15] and nondiabetic [n = 15] rats, respectively). Serum osteocalcin was significantly correlated with the serum concentration of insulinlike growth factor I (r = 0.89, P less than 0.001). Bone strength measured as the energy needed to fracture the femur was markedly decreased (5.3 +/- 1.4 and 8.4 +/- 1.3 N.m.degree in diabetic and nondiabetic rats, respectively; P less than 0.01). These histological, chemical, and biomechanical data clearly indicate that long-standing diabetes in BB rats results in severe low-turnover osteoporosis probably related to decreased osteoblast recruitment and/or function.\r"

In the postabsorptive state, the deep tissues of the forearm (mostly skeletal muscle) took up glucose (mean +/- SE 1.09 +/- 0.17 mumol.min-1.dl-1 forearm vol), beta-hydroxybutyrate (0.267 +/- 0.130 mumol.min-1.dl-1), and O2 (9.96 +/- 1.02 mumol.min-1.dl-1) and released lactate (0.284 +/- 0.098 mumol.min-1.dl-1), glycerol (0.029 +/- 0.012 mumol.min-1.dl-1), citrate (0.091 +/- 0.030 mumol.min-1.dl-1), alanine (0.184 +/- 0.044 mumol.min-1.dl-1), CO2 (7.36 +/- 0.97 mumol.min-1.dl-1), and protons (12.1 +/- 1.4 pmol.min-1.dl-1). Forearm blood flow (by venous occlusion plethysmography) was 2.95 +/- 0.18 ml.min-1.dl-1, and intra-arterial systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 116 +/- 3/76 +/- 2 mmHg. Local indirect calorimetry indicated dominance of fat as the oxidative substrate (RQ 0.76 +/- 0.09) and an energy expenditure rate of 1.03 +/- 0.11 cal.min-1.dl-1 forearm vol. One hundred minutes of intra-arterial insulin infusion (deep venous plasma insulin concn of 125 +/- 11 microU/ml) had no detectable effect on forearm blood flow, resting forearm vascular resistance, heart rate, or blood pressure. Local hyperinsulinemia significantly stimulated glucose uptake (to 4.79 +/- 0.61 mumol.min-1.dl-1 forearm vol, P less than 0.001), lactate and pyruvate release (to 0.710 +/- 0.093 and 0.032 +/- 0.016 mumol.min-1.dl-1 forearm vol, respectively; P less than 0.01 for both), potassium uptake (0.76 +/- 0.22 mueq.min-1.dl-1, P less than 0.001), and free fatty acid uptake (0.123 +/- 0.041 mumol.min-1.dl-1 forearm vol, P less than 0.05); glycerol balance switched to a net uptake (P less than 0.001), alanine release was restrained by 33% (P less than 0.05), and beta-hydroxybutyrate and citrate release were unchanged. Despite these metabolic changes, local rates of substrate oxidation and energy expenditure were not altered by insulin. In contrast, forearm proton release was significantly stimulated by insulin (to 14.8 +/- 1.4 pmol.min-1.dl-1, P less than 0.02). Proton release was also found to be directly related to resting forearm vascular resistance independent of the effect of insulin (multiple r = 0.64, P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We have previously shown that continuous hyperinsulinemia induces insulin insensitivity. This study examines the mechanisms responsible for the greater hypoglycemic effect of pulsatile insulin administration, in particular, whether prolonged pulsatile hyperinsulinemia induces insulin insensitivity. Basally and 1 h after cessation of a 20-h pulsatile infusion of insulin (0.5 mU.kg-1.min-1), eight nondiabetic human subjects were assessed for 1) glucose turnover with [3-3H]glucose, 2) insulin sensitivity by minimal-model analysis of intravenous glucose tolerance tests, and 3) monocyte insulin-receptor binding. The time-averaged plasma insulin levels were 30 +/- 5 mU/L (mean +/- SE) during the infusion, which was similar to the levels achieved in our previous continuous hyperinsulinemia study. However, the average rate of glucose infusion to maintain euglycemia was 55% greater than in the previous study. Hepatic glucose production was -5.2 +/- 1.4 mumol.kg-1.min-1 during the infusion but returned to preinfusion levels 1 h after the infusion was stopped. Insulin sensitivity (Sl) and glucose tolerance (rate of glucose disappearance, Kg) showed changes opposite in direction to our previous continuous hyperinsulinemia study (pre- vs. postinfusion Kg 1.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.2 min-1 x 10(2), NS; pre- vs. postinfusion Sl 8.4 +/- 2.3 vs. 11.8 +/- 3.7 min-1.mU-1.L x 10(4), P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of cyclosporin administered from 30 to 100 days of age on pancreatic events and the development of insulin-dependent diabetes has been studied by serial pancreatic biopsy of individual diabetes-prone BB/Edinburgh rats. Cyclosporin completely prevented the development of diabetes up to 150 days of age and reduced the incidence to 50% of controls at 452 days of age. Islet cell surface antibodies paralleled the development of diabetes. Insulin autoantibodies were unrelated to diabetes and not affected by cyclosporin. Immunohistochemical analysis of pancreatic biopsies from untreated control diabetes-prone rats with monoclonal antibodies specific for rat MHC molecules and T- and B-lymphocyte and macrophage subsets showed that the first abnormality seen in rats that subsequently developed diabetes was hyperexpression of MHC class I molecules on vascular endothelium and islet cells. This was followed by accumulation of ED1+ macrophages at perivascular and periductal sites adjacent to noninfiltrated islets. Increased expression of MHC class II molecules on vascular endothelial cells was also noted. Most cells infiltrating the islets initially were also ED1+ macrophages, followed by increasing numbers of other activated effector cells including helper and cytotoxic-suppressor T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Obliteration of insulin-containing cells was associated with regression of the infiltrate. Treatment with cyclosporin had no effect on pancreatic hyperexpression of MHC class I molecules but markedly inhibited accumulation of ED1+ cells at extraislet sites, the subsequent recruitment of immune effector cells, and islet infiltration. This resulted in a delay of the onset of diabetes in some rats and prevention of diabetes in others.\r"

Data were recorded using a predefined proforma, and histopathological material circulated amongst a 'panel' of three further pathologists. After this process, 132 patients were classified as having early gastric cancer and 63 as dysplasia. There was good agreement between pathologists as to whether the cases had cancer or dysplasia - but 39 cases said by referring pathologists to have early gastric cancer were classified by the panel as having more extensive disease. Most early gastric cancer cases were diagnosed only after histopathological examination. Cancer or 'possible cancer' was only mentioned after 36% of the radiological investigations and 40.5% of the endoscopies. Computer aided analysis of the patients' symptoms placed 91.3% of the early gastric cancer cases into a 'high risk' group - but was unable to distinguish between early gastric cancer and dysplasia. The five year survival rate of the cases agreed to be early gastric cancer by the panel was well over 90%, but the four year survival rate of cases registered as 'early gastric cancer' but said by the panel to have more advanced disease was under 75%. These findings may account for some of the differences between series, and emphasise the need for precise, widely agreed criteria for the diagnosis of early gastric cancer and gastric dysplasia.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of cisapride, a new gastrointestinal prokinetic drug, on oesophageal motility and acid reflux was studied in 14 children with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, receiving either placebo or cisapride 0.15 mg/kg intravenously. Cisapride significantly (p less than 0.01) increased the lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (+124%), the amplitude (+84%) and duration (+24%) of oesophageal peristaltic waves, whereas the placebo treatment did not produce any changes. Subsequently, all 14 children underwent 24 hour oesophageal pH-monitoring before and after four weeks of treatment with oral cisapride 0.2 mg/kg tid given in addition to postural therapy and thickened feedings. The 24 hour intraoesophageal pH recordings and symptomatic scores were compared with those of 10 control patients treated only by postural therapy and thickened feedings. When compared with baseline pH data, cisapride significantly reduced the oesophageal acid exposure time, the mean duration of each reflux episode, the duration of the longest reflux episode and the number of long lasting reflux episodes; the number of reflux episodes was not influenced. The effect of cisapride was marked and consistent during fasting and sleep periods. Oesophageal acid exposure was reduced more significantly in patients given cisapride (-61%) than in controls (-24%; p less than 0.001). Symptom improvement was greater after four weeks of cisapride treatment (score reduction: 61%) than after postural and dietary therapy alone (score reduction: 42%; p less than 0.01). No adverse effects occurred. These findings suggest that cisapride is a valuable drug in the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in children.\r"

  ".U": "90202034\r", 
  ".W": "Arterial stiffening is the principal cause of increasing systolic pressure with advancing years and in patients with arterial hypertension. It is associated with progressive arterial dilation and is due to degeneration of the arterial wall, probably as a consequence of repetitive cyclic stress; it increases systolic pressure directly by increasing amplitude of the pressure wave generated by a given flow impulse from the heart and indirectly by increasing wave velocity so that wave reflection from the periphery occurs earlier, augmenting pressure in late systole. The first mechanism affects pressure in both the central and peripheral arteries, the second predominantly in the central arteries. Change in brachial systolic pressure with age underestimates the rise in systolic pressure in the aorta and left ventricle. Arterial stiffness is reduced passively with reduction in arterial pressure. Drugs have little or no direct effect on arterial stiffness but can markedly reduce wave reflection. In patients with stiffened arteries, reduction in wave reflection decreases aortic systolic pressure augmentation. The decreased systolic pressure in central arteries brought about by this mechanism is not detected when systolic pressure is measured in a peripheral (brachial or radial) artery but can be inferred from change in contour of the pressure wave recorded in peripheral arteries.\r"

To examine whether modifying renal renin content or release influences the response to central stimuli linked to sleep stage alternation, plasma renin activity was measured every 10 minutes from 11:00 PM to 8:00 AM in three groups of six subjects. The first group received one 40 mg dose of the diuretic furosemide; the second group underwent the night experiment after 3 days on a low sodium diet; the third group received one 100 mg dose of the beta-blocker atenolol. Each subject underwent a control night when a placebo was given. The nocturnal curves were analyzed with a pulse detection program. For the control nights, 74 of the 83 sleep cycles were associated with significant plasma renin activity oscillations; non-rapid eye movement sleep occurred in the ascending portions and rapid eye movement sleep in the declining portions of the oscillations. These oscillations persisted in the three groups of subjects during the experimental nights and the relation with the sleep stages was not disturbed. Acute stimulation by furosemide amplified the oscillations and led to a general upward trend of the nocturnal profiles. Similarly, a low sodium diet, which led to a slow increase in renal renin content, provoked large oscillations with high initial levels. However, in both cases the mean relative amplitude of the oscillations, expressed as a percentage of the nocturnal means, was similar to that of the control nights and approximated 60%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of the brain kallikrein-kinin system in the regulation of arterial blood pressure of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats was evaluated. Intracerebroventricular administration of the kinin antagonist [DArg0]Hyp3-Thi5,8[DPhe7]bradykinin caused no change in mean blood pressure in Wistar-Kyoto, Sprague-Dawley, or spontaneously hypertensive rats. The antagonist proved to be very potent in blocking the pressor effect of intracerebroventricular bradykinin (32 +/- 3 vs. 3 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). It was specific, as the pressor effect induced by other unrelated peptides was similar during the infusion of either vehicle or kinin antagonist (angiotensin II, 25 +/- 4 vs. 26 +/- 2 mm Hg; prostaglandin E2, 48 +/- 3 vs. 47 +/- 8 mm Hg; norepinephrine, 17 +/- 2 vs. 18 +/- 2 mm Hg; leucine-enkephaline, 15 +/- 2 vs. 16 +/- 1 mm Hg; neurotensin, 18 +/- 2 vs. 19 +/- 1 mm Hg; substance P, 19 +/- 2 vs. 19 +/- 2 mm Hg). Intracerebroventricular administration of 1 mg captopril, an inhibitor of kininase II (one of the enzymes responsible for kinin degradation), caused no change in mean blood pressure in normotensive rats, whereas it increased mean blood pressure by 44 +/- 9 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) in spontaneously hypertensive rats. This increase in mean blood pressure was blocked and then reversed into a hypotensive effect (22 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) during the infusion of kinin antagonist. Our data suggest that the pressor effect induced by intracerebroventricular captopril is due to a transient elevation in endogenous brain kinin levels, supporting the hypothesis that the brain kallikrein-kinin system plays a role in the central regulation of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

Supportive psychotherapy as well as specific advice to return to work for patients with uncomplicated AMIs shortens length of convalescence. Little evidence exists, however, that current interventions largely geared to improving cardiac status have any impact on ultimate return to work. Specific interventions tailored to individuals at risk of not working may increase rates of return to work.\r"

Analysis of variance was used to analyze the data. Significant decreases were demonstrated as a result of relaxation, in blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and report of pain on the visual descriptor scale. No significant differences were seen in analgesic use or visual analogue scale scores. Eleven subjects (73.3%) said the technique was helpful in their pain management.

In nondiabetic patients hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia develop, and in diabetic patients hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia develop from diminished or lack of islet cell function. The goal for the diabetic patient immediately after surgery is to keep metabolism as nearly normal as possible. Methods to achieve normoglycemia are a matter of physician preference, but failure to maintain physiologic control subjects these patients to a wide range of abnormalities. Insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia modify general metabolism, impair protein synthesis and ion regulation, predispose to neural damage, interfere with blood cell functions, and alter drug detoxification. If exogenous insulin is necessary, intravenous administration has gained wide acceptance, but the subcutaneous route produces satisfactory results. Frequent and accurate blood glucose monitoring is crucial to adjustment of insulin doses for restoration and maintenance of normoglycemia in the postoperative period.\r"

Special attention is given to mechanisms that may be responsible for the respiratory depression that appears to be the primary sequela of brain hypoxia in animal models. Although a variety of potential mechanisms for hypoxic respiratory depression are considered, emphasis is placed on changes in the neuromodulator constituency of the respiratory neuron microenvironment during hypoxia as the primary cause of this phenomenon. Hypoxia is accompanied by a net increase in neuronal inhibition due to both decreased excitatory and increased inhibitory neuromodulator levels. A survey of hypoxia-tolerant cellular systems and organisms suggests that hypoxic respiratory depression may be a manifestation of the depression of cellular metabolism, which appears to be a major adaptation to limited oxygen availability in these systems.\r"

  ".W": "The objectives of this study were to determine how long increased insulin sensitivity, elicited by exercise training, persists after the end of training and what the effect of weight gain is on this retention. Exercise-trained (ET) rats ran voluntarily in freely rotating wheel cages, and insulin sensitivity was assessed by oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and insulin suppression tests (IST). After training, ET rats were retired for 1, 3, or 7 days (R1, R3, or R7). Initial OGTT and IST studies indicated that sensitivity to insulin-induced glucose uptake was increased in ET rats compared with sedentary control (C) rats and was progressively lost with retirement: ET greater than R1 and R3 greater than R7 and C rats, and this reaction was generally associated with a rapid gain in body weight. Subsequent IST tests were performed on C and R7 rats fed laboratory chow or a hypocaloric diet consisting of equal parts of cellulose and chow for 7 days before the test. The results of these tests showed that steady-state serum glucose (SSSG) levels averaged 165 +/- 12 mg/dl for chow-fed C rats and 172 +/- 11 mg/dl for chow-fed R7 rats that gained body weight at rates twice those of C rats. Chow-fed R7 rats, gaining weight at rates comparable to C rats, had SSSG levels of 104 +/- 6 mg/dl. C and R7 rats fed the hypocaloric diet had SSSG values of 102 +/- 6 and 59 +/- 4 mg/dl, respectively. Muscle glycogen levels were comparable in all groups, and liver glycogen was lower in C and R7 rats fed the hypocaloric diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The vascular space tracers, labeled erythrocytes and albumin, and a water space tracer, 1,8-octanediol, were injected with the norepinephrine, and right atrium-aortic root dilution curves were obtained in nine dogs, at rest and at two increasing levels of exercise. Extravascular lung water multiple tracer dilutional estimates increased with flow and rapidly approached a maximal asymptotic value representing 75% of the postmortem lung weight. The ratio of the extravascular lung water measured in this way to that measured gravimetrically also increased, to reach an asymptotic proportion of close to 100%. The transit time-defined central vascular space increased linearly with flow; the ratio of lung tissue space to lung vascular space, therefore, decreased with increasing flow. The mean tracer upslope norepinephrine extractions at rest and at the two levels of exercise were 17 +/- 1.2, 14 +/- 0.8, and 15 +/- 0.8% (SE). With the use of the Crone approximation, we computed permeability-surface area products for norepinephrine; these increased linearly with flow. If permeability does not change, the increase in the permeability-surface area product with flow can be attributed to capillary recruitment. We conclude that when all lung tissue has become accessible to 1,8-octanediol delivered via the perfused vascular space, there is nevertheless further recruitment, with increase in flow, of vascular surface that can extract norepinephrine.\r"

The animals were ventilated via a low tracheostomy by HFOV or conventional intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) with and without added positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The transverse muscle tension of the trachea above the tracheostomy was measured and found to be lower during HFOV when compared with IPPV or IPPV with PEEP. When both vagi were cooled to 8 degrees C to interrupt afferent traffic from the lungs, there was no longer any difference between the modes of ventilation. In a second series of experiments, the airflow resistance of the upper airway above the tracheostomy was measured (Ruaw). During HFOV, Ruaw was significantly lower than during either IPPV or IPPV with PEEP. We conclude that HFOV induces a relaxation of tracheal smooth muscle and a reduction of upper airway resistance through a vagally mediated mechanism.\r"

When the trachea was air filled there was no resting secretion and none was induced by methacholine (0.02 mM). Histology showed that the trachea has very few submucosal glands. When the trachea was filled with KH, with fluorescent bovine serum albumin in the surrounding KH solution, the rate of transport of albumin into the lumen was measured. Methacholine (0.02 mM) and phenylephrine (0.1 mM) more than doubled the output of albumin, and albuterol (0.1 mM) increased it more than fourfold. Cooling the preparation to 4 degrees C decreased the spontaneous output of albumin to less than one-half control and abolished the increase in output due to albuterol. Addition of sodium cyanide (1 mM) to the preparation abolished the increase in albumin transport due to albuterol. Serosal-to-mucosal transport of fluorescent dextran (mol wt 70,000) was less than one-third that of albumin and was not enhanced by methacholine, phenylephrine, or albuterol. Lysozyme output, an index of serous cell secretion, was barely detectable in controls and was not enhanced by any of the drugs. We conclude that the rabbit trachea has no measurable submucosal gland secretion and that it can actively transport albumin into the lumen via the epithelium. The transport rate is enhanced by methacholine, phenylephrine, and especially by albuterol.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of repeated antigen inhalation on airway cellular composition and airway responsiveness were examined in primates. Airway cellular composition was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and airway responsiveness was measured as the bronchoconstrictor response to cumulative methacholine dose-response determinations over the course of a 10-wk study. Control animals, exposed to repeated vehicle inhalation challenges, were tested in parallel with the antigen-challenged group. Repeated antigen inhalation resulted in a prolonged inflammatory reaction characterized by a large increase in airway eosinophils (3 +/- 1 to 59 +/- 15%, P less than 0.01). Airway eosinophilia was associated with an increase in airway responsiveness as indicated by a leftward shift in the methacholine dose-response curves, an increase in the slope of the dose-response curves, and a decrease in PC100 values (the dose of methacholine required to cause a 100% increase in lung resistance). The number of BAL eosinophils and the level of eosinophil major basic protein in BAL correlated significantly with methacholine PC100 values (r = 0.61, P less than 0.01 and r = 0.64, P less than 0.01, respectively). Histological examination of lung biopsy samples taken at week 10 of the study demonstrated a striking infiltration of eosinophils in the antigen-challenged animals. These results support earlier observations that demonstrated an association between increases in airway eosinophils and increases in airway responsiveness and suggest that eosinophils are involved in the pathogenesis of hyperresponsive airways.\r"

  ".U": "90203127\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to evaluate whether chronic deficiency of pancreatic glucagon in patients with diabetes secondary to total pancreatectomy (PX) is responsible for the commonly observed increase in blood concentrations of gluconeogenic precursors (alanine, lactate, and pyruvate). Seven PX patients were studied on two different occasions: 1) after an overnight insulin infusion (0.15 mU/kg.min) and 2) after an overnight insulin/glucagon infusion (2 ng/kg.min). Five type 1 diabetic individuals were also studied after a similar overnight insulin infusion. In the morning of each study day, [6-3H]glucose and [1-14C]glucose were rapidly injected for determination of total glucose turnover rate [( 6-3H]glucose) and glucose recycling (difference between [6-3H]glucose and [1-14C]glucose turnover rate). Basal concentrations of hormones, glucose, and intermediary metabolites were measured. After overnight insulin infusion, plasma glucose concentration (3.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 6.8 +/- 1.4 mmol/L), turnover rate (8.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 13.7 +/- 1.9 mumol/kg.min), and percent glucose recycling (5.6 +/- 3.9% vs. 19.0 +/- 3.8%) were significantly lower in PX patients than in type 1 diabetic individuals (P less than 0.05-0.01). On the contrary, blood alanine (459 +/- 93 vs. 263 +/- 28 mumol/L), lactate (1157 +/- 109 vs. 818 +/- 116 mumol/L), and pyruvate (71 +/- 8 vs. 42 +/- 3 mumol/L) were significantly higher than those values in type 1 diabetic patients (P less than 0.05-0.01). Insulin/glucagon infusion increased plasma glucose concentration (8.7 +/- 1.5 mmol/L), total turnover (18.1 +/- 1.7 mumol/kg.min), and percent recycling (20.4 +/- 6.6%) to values similar to those in type 1 diabetic subjects. The change in glucose metabolism was associated with a significant drop in blood concentrations of alanine (179 +/- 24 mumol/L), lactate (611 +/- 25 mumol/L), and pyruvate (30 +/- 3 mumol/L; all P less than 0.05-0.01 vs. insulin infusion alone). In PX patients, the glucose turnover rate was inversely correlated with blood concentrations of both alanine (r = 0.67) and lactate (r = 0.71; P less than 0.01). In conclusion, chronic deficiency of pancreatic glucagon in PX patients 1) is associated with a decreased rate of glucose turnover, 2) causes a marked impairment in glucose recycling (an index of the activity of hepatic gluconeogenesis), and 3) increases blood concentrations of alanine, lactate, and pyruvate. All abnormalities are reversed by glucagon.\r"

  ".U": "90203129\r", 
  ".W": "Animal studies have shown that GH is necessary for the increased renal production of calcitriol during dietary phosphorus deprivation (PD). These studies suggest that this adaptive change in vitamin D metabolism is mediated through insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and/or insulin. We subjected 16 GH-deficient children to 96 h of severe dietary PD twice, first before and again during recombinant GH replacement. Half of the children received low dose and half received high dose replacement with recombinant GH. We measured renal tubular reabsorption maximum for phosphate corrected for glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR), PTH, IGF-I, calcidiol, and calcitriol pre- and postdietary PD, both off and on GH. We also assessed insulin secretion during an oral glucose load (OGTT) off and on GH. Basal PTH, calcidiol, calcitriol, and fasting blood sugar were unaffected by GH therapy. PD did not affect PTH or calcidiol either off or on GH. Basal TmP/GFR rose on GH therapy (4.8 +/- 0.2 to 6.3 +/- 0.4 mg/dL) and with PD (4.8 +/- 0.2 to 5.7 +/- 0.2 mg/dL off and 6.3 +/- 0.4 to 7.8 +/- 0.3 mg/dL on GH). The increments due to PD and GH therapy were additive. The increments on GH were independent of the GH dose. Before GH replacement, calcitriol did not rise during PD (22.3 +/- 2.1 to 23.3 +/- 1.9 pg/mL), but during GH therapy, PD caused a significant rise in calcitriol (23.8 +/- 2.5 to 33.3 +/- 2.4 pg/mL; P less than 0.0001). The increment in calcitriol during PD was significantly greater in the high dose than it was in the low dose group (11.7 +/- 1.5 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.6 pg/mL; P less than 0.05). GH therapy caused a rise in the IGF-I level that was significantly greater in the high dose (0.26 +/- 0.03 to 3.15 +/- 0.56 U/mL) than in the low dose (0.27 +/- 0.02 to 0.68 +/- 0.13 U/mL) group. Insulin in response to OGTT was significantly greater after GH therapy (4155 +/- 600 microU/mL.min off GH; 6504 +/- 1153 microU/mL.min on GH), although there was no difference between the low and high dose groups. Regression analysis demonstrated a correlation between the change in calcitriol during PD and the IGF-I level (r = 0.83). There was no correlation between insulin levels and the change in calcitriol or between IGF-I or insulin levels and the increment in TmP/GFR during GH therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Tissues were obtained from women undergoing hysterectomy and oophorectomy. The largest follicle or the CL was dissected from the ovary depending on whether the surgery was performed in the follicular or luteal phase. The day of the cycle was determined by onset of last menstrual period and was confirmed by endometrial histology. Total RNA was examined by Northern blot analysis, using as probes specific 32P-labeled cDNA inserts encoding each human enzyme. Early follicles demonstrated detectable mRNA for both P450scc and P450(17 alpha), but not for P450AROM or 3 beta HSD. P450AROM was detectable late in the follicular phase and appeared markedly induced in the CL. 3 beta HSD was detectable only in the CL. Levels of P450(17 alpha) mRNA remained relatively unchanged throughout the cycle, whereas P450scc mRNA levels were greatly increased in the CL. The presence of P450(17 alpha) mRNA in the human CL is of interest, since it is absent from the bovine CL, and this is consistent with the ability of the human, but not the bovine, CL to synthesize 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and estrogens. The fact that P450AROM expression is highest in CL is surprising, since plasma estrogen levels are highest during the late follicular phase of the cycle, and may suggest that CL estrogen biosynthesis is limited by 17 alpha-hydroxylase or 17,20-lyase activities.\r"

  ".W": "The kinetics of plasma immunoreactive [D-Trp6,Des-Gly-NH2(10)]GnRH ethylamide, a potent GnRH agonist, was assessed in nine normal adult men over a period of 24 h after a rapid sc injection of 1 or 10 micrograms peptide/kg BW. The specific RIA of the GnRH agonist is characterized by a minimum detectable dose of 5.0 +/- 0.5 pg peptide, while the midrange effective dose is 73 +/- 8 pg. The within- and between-assay coefficients of variation range from 2-7% and from 10-15%, respectively. When the volume of the central compartment is set proportional to the logarithm of the plasma concentration of the GnRH agonist, the time courses of both doses are statistically well represented by a two-compartment model to which a source compartment is added to represent the sc route of administration. The sc diffusion to plasma is 5 times faster than any other fractional transport rate of the model (5%/min). Disposal occurs at a maximum rate of 0.55%/min from the central compartment, which includes plasma, and 0.25%/min from the peripheral compartment. As simulated with the model, 90% of the steady state is reached 13 h and 45 min after the onset of a sc continuous infusion. A molecule spends, on the average, from 6 h to 9 h and 45 min in the whole organism; 30-50% of this period is accounted for by residence in the central compartment. The volume of the central compartment reaches 208 mL/kg BW, and the MCR is estimated at 1.18 mL/min.kg BW for a steady state of 1 ng/mL plasma. The plasma dynamics of [D-Trp6,Des-Gly-NH2(10)]GnRH ethylamide in men are at least 10 times slower than those reported for the natural GnRH, thus indicating the relevance of its clinical use in suppressive therapy of LH secretion.\r"

They are by no ways identified in either the animal experiment or under clinical conditions. In search for factors, conditioning the response of bone to estrogen deficiency, we have conducted a study in females under treatment with the GnRH agonist decapeptyl (D-Trp6-LHRH). This drug blocks ovarian function and was administered for treatment of endometriosis or uterine leiomyoma. We determined spinal (dual photon absorptiometry) and forearm (single photon absorptiometry) bone mineral density before and 3 and 6 months after the onset of therapy and measured biochemical parameters of bone metabolism. Our results showed an increase in bone turnover after initiation of estrogen deficiency, as indicated by the elevation of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. This resulted in a secondary decrease in serum intact PTH and 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between pretreatment values of serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 as well as its decrease and the reduction in bone mass during GnRH agonist treatment. This demonstrates that the patients' metabolic conditions predict their response to estrogen deficiency.\r"

IGFBP-1 levels in vivo have been shown to be inversely correlated with circulating insulin concentrations. This study investigated the direct effects of insulin on IGFBP-1 production in vitro. Addition of insulin to HepG2 cultures induced a rapid dose-dependent decrease in IGFBP-1 synthesis and secretion independent of the glucose concentration in the medium. As assessed by ligand binding and specific RIA, levels of IGFBP-1 were 20-50% of control levels in 18-h conditioned medium from insulin-treated cells. Monoclonal antibody studies indicated that the suppressive effect of insulin on IGFBP-1 synthesis was mediated through specific interaction with the insulin receptor. Therefore, HepG2 cells respond to insulin by altering the synthesis and secretion of IGFBP-1 in a manner that mimics many of the changes in plasma IGFBP-1 levels observed in vivo and provide an in vitro model for studies of IGFBP-1 biosynthesis.\r"

Seven normal weight and 10 obese women served as controls. Measurement of the MCR-D and PR-D was accomplished by iv saline infusion (0.9% NaCl solution) on day 1 as a control and a 4-h iv dehydroepiandrosterone (unlabeled) infusion (1 mg/h) was performed on day 2. Mean MCR-D was more than 2-fold higher in the obese controls compared to the normal weight controls. However, the plasma concentration of DHEA(PC-D) was not significantly different in the normal and obese control women, since the PR-D was increased proportionately to the MCR-D. The MCR-D and the PR-D were coupled through insulin in the control women, and their correlation coefficients with IRI were positive and identical (0.77 and 0.73, respectively). In contrast, IRI was negatively correlated with PR-D in the PCOS-AN women. Also, unlike the control women, there was minimal or no change in the MCR-D across a broad range of IRI in the PCOS-AN women. Thus, the MCR-D and PR-D were not coupled in these women.\r"

  ".W": "We examined whether obesity must first exceed a critical threshold before it begins to impair insulin action in volunteers with normal glucose tolerance. Forty-nine healthy volunteers, whose ideal body weight ranged from 80-240%, underwent euglycemic clamps during sequential insulin infusions of 0.4, 1.0, and 10 mU/kg.min. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by estimation of the plasma insulin concentration that produced half-maximal glucose disposal (EC50). Glucose disposal during the highest insulin infusion was used as an index of maximal insulin responsiveness. There was a significant correlation between body mass index and insulin sensitivity (EC50) best fitted by a straight line that broke at a body mass index of 26.8 kg/m2 (P less than 0.05). Below this breakpoint (26.8 kg/m2), there was no significant correlation (r = 0.1), whereas above the breakpoint there was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.8; P less than 0.001) between EC50 and body mass index. In contrast, insulin responsiveness was not significantly correlated with body mass index (r = 0.1). We conclude that insulin sensitivity for glucose disposal is impaired in human subjects with normal glucose tolerance who exceed a critical threshold of obesity, which corresponds to an ideal body weight of 120%. This threshold is consistent with the nonlinear (J-shaped) relationship between obesity and its other adverse health consequences, and may have important implications for desirable weight goals.\r"

No significant changes in irGnRH concentrations were found in the culture medium after 48-h incubation of estradiol, estriol, or progesterone. Both estriol and estradiol augmented, while progesterone decreased, the irGnRH release induced by 8-bromo-cAMP. The stimulatory effect of estriol or estradiol was reversed by the concomitant addition of progesterone. The secretagogue effect of activin on irGnRH release from cultured placental cells was increased by the presence of estriol and reduced by the addition of progesterone. The action of estriol was counteracted by both tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist, and progesterone. The inhibitory effect of progesterone was completely reversed by RU 486, a specific receptor antagonist. The addition of morphine, methionine-enkephalin, or UP50, 488H which preferentially bind mu-, delta-, and kappa-opiate receptors, respectively, did not decrease basal irGnRH release from cultured human placental cells. However, both morphine and UP50, 488H significantly inhibited 8-bromo-cAMP-induced GnRH release. The present results showed that steroid hormones and opiate receptor agonists influence irGnRH release from human cultured cells, suggesting that local interaction between steroids and peptides modulates irGnRH release from human placenta.\r"

  ".W": "Ten patients with active acromegaly, six with a poor response to previous therapies and four newly diagnosed, were treated with the long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide (Sandostatin; 200-500 micrograms/day, sc, twice or three times daily) for 6-15 months. There was rapid clinical improvement in all patients. The mean daily serum GH concentration was reduced by 64% and was normalized (all GH values less than 2 micrograms/L) in three patients. Serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations were lowered by 40% and were normalized in eight patients. Serum concentrations of the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), an index of tissue collagen metabolism, were reduced by 40% and were normalized in all patients with initially elevated values. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the mean serum GH and IGF-I levels (r = 0.47; P less than 0.001) as well as between serum GH and PIIINP levels (r = 0.34; P less than 0.05) and between serum IGF-I and PIIINP (r = 0.50; P less than 0.001). The effects of octreotide on pituitary tumor size and pathology were evaluated in one patient. The therapy did not seem to be associated with significant changes in sellar computed tomographic scans or light microscopic findings. The drug was generally well tolerated. However, indications of significant hepato-biliary dysfunction were noted in one patient after 5 months of therapy. This was reversible upon discontinuation of therapy and did not occur later during the rechallenge with a lower dose of the drug. However, there was probably newly formed cholelithiasis in four patients during the therapy. Our study suggests that octreotide is an effective and relatively safe new approach for treating active acromegaly. Further studies are needed to investigate long term effects on the hepatobiliary system.\r"

The LHRH antagonist Nal-Glu, ([Ac-D2Nal1,D4ClPhe2,D3Pal3,Arg5,DGlu6(AA) ,Ala10]LHRH), was given (10 mg daily) as one injection of 5 mg every 12 h. Blood samples were drawn every 24 h, and on days 1 and 7 a day curve was established by drawing hourly blood samples for 26 h. Mean serum alpha-subunit levels decreased progressively (P less than 0.001) from 2.9 +/- 0.49 micrograms/L at baseline to a nadir of 1.4 +/- 0.27 micrograms/L on day 8. In contrast, mean immunoreactive LH (IR-LH) levels decreased rapidly from 3.2 +/- 0.6 U/L at baseline to 0.9 +/- 0.08 U/L on day 2 and remained suppressed (P less than 0.001) throughout the treatment period. On day 1 after the administration of Nal-Glu mean alpha-subunit levels decreased, although not significantly (P = 0.054), from 3.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L at baseline to a nadir of 2.0 +/- 0.3 micrograms/L at 17 h. alpha-Subunit remained at this level for the remainder of day 1. On day 7, however, the baseline serum alpha-subunit level was 1.5 +/- 0.3 micrograms/L, significantly suppressed (P less than 0.01) compared to the level on day 1, and no further decrease was seen after administration of Nal-Glu. IR-LH on day 1 before the first injection of 5 mg Nal-Glu was 3.5 +/- 0.8 U/L. Then, IR-LH levels decreased significantly (P less than 0.001) to a nadir of 0.9 +/- 0.1 U/L and remained at this level throughout day 1. IR-LH levels on day 7 were at or below 1.0 U/L throughout the sampling period. These results indicate that alpha-subunit secretion can be partially suppressed after chronic administration of a LHRH antagonist. Furthermore, LH serum levels dissociate from those of pituitary glycoprotein alpha-subunit after administration of LHRH antagonist analogs.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether coexistence of Graves' disease affects the prognosis of thyroid cancer we examined the clinical and pathological characteristics of 22 differentiated thyroid carcinomas concomitant with hyperthyroidism; 13 were associated with Graves' disease, and 9 with autonomous thyroid nodules. Carcinomas were identified in a consecutive series of 359 hyperthyroid patients (132 with Graves' disease and 227 with autonomous thyroid nodules) who underwent surgery during a 6-yr period. One hundred and thirty-seven thyroid carcinomas were found in the 582 euthyroid patients operated on in the same period. In Graves' patients, carcinomas were more often multifocal (46.1% vs. 0%), locally invasive (61.5% vs. 11.1%), and metastatic to lymph nodes (61.5% vs. 11.1%) or to distant sites (23.0% vs. 0%) than in patients with autonomous thyroid nodules. In addition, carcinomas concomitant with Graves' disease were larger (3.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.7 cm) than the ones associated with autonomous thyroid nodules and showed a high recurrence rate. In euthyroid patients, aggressiveness of thyroid cancer was intermediate. Serum TSH levels were suppressed in all hyperthyroid patients with thyroid cancer. However, circulating thyroid-stimulating antibodies were present in 12 of 13 cancer patients with Graves' disease, but were absent in patients with autonomous thyroid nodules. Our study suggests, therefore, that TSAb may play a role in determining the high aggressiveness of thyroid cancer in Graves' disease patients and indicates that a vigorous treatment should be pursued in this subgroup of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Prenatal treatment of pregnancies at risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency was carried out in conjunction with chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the first trimester for analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Fourteen families of a total of 49 families at risk for this disease elected to undergo both prenatal treatment and diagnosis via CVS. Dexamethasone administration to the pregnant woman was initiated at a mean gestational age of 7 weeks (range, 4-10 weeks) before testing to determine whether the fetus was affected with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and CVS was performed at a gestational age of 8-10 weeks. Two affected female fetuses were identified by molecular genetic techniques among this group; neonatal physical examination demonstrated amelioration of the degree of genital ambiguity compared with both nonprenatally treated older sisters with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The duration of unnecessary prenatal dexamethasone treatment for unaffected or male fetuses was substantially reduced in the CVS group compared with that in a cohort of 8 prenatally treated pregnancies in which amniocentesis was performed in the early second trimester. There were no major morbidities observed in the treated pregnancies. Postnatal confirmation of CVS diagnosis was obtained in all cases in which DNA from an affected sibling was available for comparative analysis with the DNA from chorionic villus tissue. We conclude based on these data that the benefit/risk ratio is favorable for prenatal administration of dexamethasone in pregnancies at risk for 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Treatment should be initiated during the first trimester in conjunction with diagnosis by CVS/molecular genetic techniques. Long term postnatal surveillance is recommended for all offspring of dexamethasone-treated pregnancies.\r"

  ".U": "90203166\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported a 25% fall in glucose utilization (Rd) and glucose production (Ra) in normal volunteers during an overnight fast, when glycogenolysis accounts for approximately 70% of hepatic glucose output (HGO). This reduction in Ra and Rd was positively correlated with reductions in glycerol and FFA. To determine if a similar fall in HGO occurs after a prolonged fast when HGO depends solely upon gluconeogenesis, seven normal male volunteers were fasted for 72 h. Glucose kinetics were then assessed overnight using a [3-3H]glucose infusion from 2200-0800 h. Plasma glucose (3.6 +/- 0.1 mM), immunoreactive insulin (2.7 +/- 0.4 mU/L), C-peptide (0.22 +/- 0.03 nmol/l), Rd (1.30 +/- 0.03 mg/kg.min), and Ra (1.28 +/- 0.03 mg/kg.min) were suppressed, and plasma glucagon (98.8 +/- 13.2 pmol/L) was elevated compared to values obtained during the overnight fast, but none of these parameters changed overnight after the 3-day fast. Plasma lactate (0.98 +/- 0.09 mmol/L) and alanine (0.18 +/- 0.03 mmol/L) levels were also unchanged throughout the night. Plasma glycerol (0.14 +/- 0.03 mmol/L) and FFA (0.98 +/- 0.07 mmol/L) were significantly elevated compared to values during the overnight fast, but failed to fall during the study as had been observed during a 14-h fast. We conclude that the modulation of HGO observed during an overnight fast does not occur during prolonged fasting. The lack of nocturnal modulation of HGO when plasma FFA and glycerol levels are fixed at elevated concentrations supports a role of FFA and/or glycerol in the modulation of HGO during an overnight fast.\r"

  ".W": "We report here a defect in tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor from an insulin-resistant patient with acanthosis nigricans using cultured Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphocytes. As judged by affinity labeling and immunoblotting, the alpha- and beta-subunits of insulin receptors from the patient's lymphocytes exhibited the same mol wt as those from control subjects. Lectin-purified extracts from lymphocytes of the patient and the control subjects containing the same insulin-binding capacity were assayed for autophosphorylation and the ability to phosphorylate histone H2B. The degree of insulin-dependent autophosphorylation and the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor from the patient's lymphocytes were decreased to 15% and 13%, respectively, in a cell-free system. The insulin-dependent autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor was also impaired in intact EBV lymphocytes from the patient. Consistent with these results, we found that one of this patient's alleles had a mutation in which valine is substituted for Gly996, the third glycine in the conserved Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif in the kinase domain. Thus, it seems likely that the defect in tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor cause the insulin resistance in this patient. The EBV lymphocyte can be a good system to detect genetically determined abnormalities in the insulin receptor.\r"

We, therefore, determined plasma BGP in 21 adult GH-deficient patients treated with biosynthetic human GH in a double blind cross-over study. We also examined 9 patients with acromegaly before and after surgery. The GH-deficient patients had normal initial plasma BGP concentrations, whereas the acromegalic patients had highly significantly increased concentrations (P less than 0.001). During treatment with human GH, plasma BGP (and other nonspecific biochemical markers of bone turnover) increased significantly (P less than 0.001). During placebo treatment plasma BGP showed baseline values. In the acromegalic patients a significant decrease in plasma BGP concentrations was seen 1 week after surgery. The present study suggests that plasma BGP is a useful biochemical marker of the effect of treatment of both GH deficiency and GH excess/disorders.\r"

Such a treatment, however, results in increased bone turnover and loss of bone mass. In the present study 17 women with endometriosis were treated with 400 mg nafarelin combined with 1.2 mg norethisterone (NET) for 6 months, followed by 6 months with only 1.2 mg NET. The data were compared to data from a previously published study of 9 women treated for 6 months with 400 mg nafarelin alone, followed by 6 months without treatment. In the group treated with nafarelin plus NET the biochemical parameter of bone resorption (fasting urinary hydroxyproline) remained virtually unchanged, compared to a highly significant increase in the nafarelin-treated group. Estimates of bone formation (serum alkaline phosphatase and plasma bone Gla protein) increased in the nafarelin plus NET group, but to only a minor extent compared to those in the nafarelin group. In addition, bone mineral in the forearm, the spine, and the total skeleton remained virtually unchanged in the group treated with nafarelin plus NET, compared to the bone loss of 2-6%/6 months in the nafarelin group. We conclude that addition of NET to nafarelin treatment of endometriosis seems to have a bone-sparing effect.\r"

  ".W": "The T84 human colonic epithelial cell line retains the ability to produce secretagogue-responsive monolayer cultures with high transepithelial resistance when grown and maintained on collagen-coated permeable supports in media supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. The addition of highly purified insulin to the basolateral but not the apical membrane side of established monolayers caused the transepithelial resistance to decline more than eightfold over a 3-4-d period. By comparing the transepithelial flux of 22Na with that of the extracellular space marker, [3H]mannitol, the decline in electrical resistance was shown to be due solely to an effect on tight junction-mediated paracellular permeability. The effect of insulin was dose dependent with a half-maximal effect at 3.9 ng/ml (approximately 0.7 nM) and fully reversible over a 10-d time course. Simultaneous addition of 2 microM cycloheximide prevented the insulin-induced decline in resistance; in fact, this combination caused a significant increase in electrical resistance. There was no effect on the short-circuit current response of insulin-treated monolayers to secretagogues so long as media was changed daily. While no gross morphological changes were apparent, there did appear to be a subtle condensation of the perijunctional actin ring as visualized using rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. These results demonstrate that insulin modulates the permeability of the occluding junction in T84 cell monolayers through a receptor mediated process which probably involves changes in protein synthesis and cytoskeletal structure. Insulin was also shown to produce similar effects on two other intestinal epithelial cell lines.\r"

To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship we first examined the effect of dietary protein on renin and angiotensinogen gene expression at the level of steady state mRNA in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Renal renin mRNA was higher on a 50% (high) compared to a 6% (low) protein diet both 3 d (9.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.4 pg/micrograms of total RNA; P less than 0.02) and 21 d (6.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.4 pg/micrograms of total RNA; P less than 0.02) after dietary change. No change occurred in either renal or liver angiotensinogen mRNA. When three levels of dietary protein were examined, renal renin mRNA was elevated on a 50% and lowered on a 6% protein diet compared to a more standard 20% protein diet. Kidney weights and renal protein, RNA, and RNA/DNA increased with the level of dietary protein reflecting protein-induced renal hypertrophy. Uninephrectomy resulted in no change in renin mRNA compared to sham operation (3.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.1 pg/micrograms RNA; P = NS) despite renal growth in the uninephrectomy group implicating dietary protein and not hypertrophy as the major factor for stimulating renin mRNA. In conclusion, the level of dietary protein is a novel and specific stimulus for changes in renal renin mRNA. The increased plasma renin activity on a high protein diet is due at least in part to increased renin synthesis.\r"

To understand M. leprae invasion better, we have investigated the role of phagocyte receptors and bacterium-bound ligands in phagocytosis of M. leprae by human monocytes. Complement receptors CR1 and CR3 mediate adherence and phagocytosis of M. leprae in nonimmune serum. Two MAbs used in combination against CR3 inhibit adherence by up to 90 +/- 3%. Two MAbs used in combination against CR1 and CR3 inhibit adherence by up to 70 +/- 1%. Single MAbs against CR1 or CR3 consistently inhibit adherence by 38-55%. In contrast, MAbs against other monocyte surface molecules, alone or in combination, do not significantly influence adherence. As studied by electron microscopy, 100% of monocyte-associated M. leprae are ingested in the presence of nonimmune serum and MAbs against CR3 markedly inhibit ingestion. Complement receptors CR1 and CR3 also mediate the low level of adherence observed in the absence of serum. Serum complement component C3 serves as a ligand on the bacterial surface in monocyte phagocytosis of M. leprae. Adherence of M. leprae to monocytes is enhanced by preopsonization (3.1 +/- 1.1-fold increase) and is markedly reduced in less than 0.5% fresh serum (66 +/- 7% reduction) or heat-inactivated serum (68 +/- 3% reduction). Adherence is also markedly reduced in C3- or factor B-depleted serum; repletion with purified C3 or factor B increases adherence 4.3 +/- 0.8- and 2.6 +/- 0.2-fold, respectively. C3 is fixed to M. leprae by the alternative pathway of complement activation, as determined by a whole bacterial cell ELISA. By electron microscopy, monocytes ingest M. leprae by conventional phagocytosis. This study demonstrates that (a) human monocyte complement receptors CR1 and CR3 mediate phagocytosis of M. leprae; (b) complement component C3 on the bacterial surface serves as a ligand for complement receptors; (c) complement component C3 binds to M. leprae by the alternative pathway of complement activation; and (d) monocytes phagocytize M. leprae by conventional phagocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "Measles virus (MV) encodes the fusion protein (F) that mediates cell fusion and intercellular spread of the virus, and is homologous to the carboxy terminus of the neuropeptide substance P (SP). In addition, the oligopeptide Z-D-Phe-L-Phe-Gly, also homologous to F and SP, inhibits MV fusion with target cells. These observations raise the question of whether MV uses the SP receptor (SPR) during a specific phase of its infectious cycle. In this report, we examine the structural and functional consequences of this interaction and show, using cross-linking studies, that MV and SP specifically bind to a 52-58-kD protein, previously reported to comprise the SPR on human IM-9 lymphoblasts. Moreover, bound MV and SP are shown to reciprocally displace each other from these cells. In addition, we demonstrate that anti-SP antisera inhibits the cell-to-cell spread of MV, and that SP blocks MV fusion with target cells. These results indicate the presence of MV-SPR interactions during viral fusion, and suggest possible novel mechanisms for viral entry into cells.\r"

Accordingly, we determined whether the inheritance of a DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) marking the renin gene of the SHR was associated with greater blood pressure than inheritance of a RFLP marking the renin gene of a normotensive control rat. In an F2 population derived from inbred SHR and inbred normotensive Lewis rats, we found the blood pressure in rats that inherited a single SHR renin allele to be significantly greater than that in rats that inherited only the Lewis renin allele. To the extent that the SHR provides a suitable model of \"nonmodulating\" hypertension, these findings raise the possibility that a structural alteration in the renin gene, or a closely linked gene, may be a pathogenetic determinant of increased blood pressure in one of the most common forms of essential hypertension in humans.\r"

The method requires no change to either technique and no additional procedures between them. The procedure was able to show the cell types involved in parvovirus infection of the fetus. The efficiency of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation for the detection of cytomegalovirus in kidney were also compared: occasional cells contained cytomegalovirus DNA but not antigen. The method is rapid, straightforward, and has wide applications in the study of viral infections, genes, and gene products in tissue sections because it permits the combined demonstration of antigen and nucleic acid on the same section in routine clinical material.\r"

Twenty nine tumours were investigated by the ligand binding assay. Only one (3.4%) tumour gave a weakly positive result (11 fmol/mg cytosol protein); the rest were all negative. Where sufficient tissue was available, the receptors were also determined by a quantitative immunoassay in 18 patients and an immunohistochemical method in 13 patients. The results were similarly all negative. It is concluded that most colorectal carcinomas, irrespective of sex, are oestrogen receptor negative, and it is thus unlikely that hormonal manipulation would have an influence on the course of the disease.\r"

Modified TPHA (M-TPHA) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-abs) tests were used for comparison. One hundred and twenty five samples were TPHA negative, of which 78 and 69 cases were also negative by M-TPHA and FTA-abs, respectively. Eighty one sera negative by TPHA at a titre of 1/80 and positive at 1/40, considered to be negative according to the manufacturer's instructions, were also negative by M-TPHA (n = 11) and by FTA-abs (n = 1). Fifty borderline positive TPHA specimens gave one negative result by both M-TPHA and FTA-abs. The remaining 24 sera were positive by all three tests. Because of the high percentage of TPHA negative results among the positive RPR sera which became reactive when rechecked by the FTA-abs, it is concluded that as a confirmatory test the TPHA should be used not instead of but in addition to the FTA-abs.\r"

To meet this demand there must be a rapid increase in the number of pathologists and laboratories able to offer this service. In turn there is a need for improved training methods. The technique of fine needle aspiration cytology is not inherently complicated. The number of possible conclusions is essentially limited to four: unsatisfactory, benign, suspicious and malignant. A computer based expert system, designed to assist pathologists in the diagnosis of fine needle aspirates of the breast, has been developed. The system prompts pathologists to categorize a number of variables in the aspirate including nuclear and cytoplasmic features, and the degree of cellular cohesion, and uses these data to reason about possible conclusions. The final diagnosis is displayed with a detailed explanation listing the factors supporting it. Initial trials with this system have been encouraging and it is envisaged that this system will be of value both in training and as an aid to routine diagnosis.\r"

In the second patient a high fever developed 1 day after injection of purified protein derivative, and the third patient blistered at the injection site; the histopathologic pattern was similar to erythema multiforme. Immunohistologic study of the epithelioid granulomas demonstrated a predominance of Leu-1--bearing, Leu-3a--bearing, and human lymphocyte antigen-DR-expressing cells. We conclude that erythema induratum of Bazin represents a tuberculid caused by heightened delayed-type hypersensitivity to components of tubercle bacilli released from latent foci of infection.\r"

Ultrastructural localization of lichen planus pemphigoides antigen was studied with the use of immunoelectron microscopic techniques. Lichen planus pemphigoides antigen showed localization similar to that of bullous pemphigoid antigen but different from that of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen. The antigenic stability of lichen planus pemphigoides antigen was different from that of bullous pemphigoid antigen or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen.

The use of these methods is limited by the expense and unavailability of the methods, the requirement for circulating autoantibodies, or both. We describe a method to distinguish between the two diseases on the basis of findings of direct immunofluorescence of a biopsy specimen after separation through the lamina lucida with 1.0 mol/L sodium chloride. The IgG appeared in the dermal side of the split specimens in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and predominantly or exclusively in the epidermal side in pemphigoid. The method was found to be relatively simple, inexpensive, applicable to specimens preserved in transport media, and 100% reliable in our group of 22 patients.\r"

Some analogs with substitutions outside a \"core\" region showed enhanced stimulation of the T cell clones. This core region of seven or eight residues was essential for recognition, whereas substitution of amino acids outside this region did not affect T cell recognition although these residues could not be omitted. Thus these core residues interact directly with the presenting HLA-DR2 molecule and/or the TCR. Except for analogs of position 419 for clone 2B6, the majority of the nonstimulatory substitution analogs did not inhibit the presentation of LQAAPALDKL and thus probably failed to bind to the HLA-DR2 molecule. Unless all of the core residues are physically involved in binding to DR2, substitution at a position not directly involved in binding appears to have an influence on other residues that do bind to the DR2 molecule. Active peptide analogs with two or more internal prolines suggest that not all analogs need be helical for activity with clone 2F10.\r"

In addition, some inflammatory states of the liver are characterized by leukocyte infiltrates. Here we demonstrate that human hepatocyte lines are capable of expressing mRNA and biologic activity for a neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF)/IL-8 in response to the inflammatory mediators IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF. Two human hepatoma cell lines (SK-Hep and Hep-G2) displayed a time- and dose-dependent increase in steady state levels of NCF/IL-8 mRNA and secretion of chemotactic activity in response to TNF and IL-1. Neutralizing antibody to NCF/IL-8 inhibited hepatocyte-derived chemotactic activity by 88%. In contrast to IL-1 and TNF, hepatocytes did not respond to LPS or IL-6 within the time and dose parameters used above. Although the expression of NCF/IL-8 mRNA (1.8 kb) was first detectable between 1 and 2 h poststimulation, significant chemotactic bioactivity was not observed until about 4 h. Heat-inactivated (100 degrees C, 30 min) cytokine failed to induced NCF/IL-8 mRNA synthesis, and cotreatment of cells with cytokine and cycloheximide super-induced NCF/IL-8 mRNA while inhibiting production of bioactivity. Thus, NCF/IL-8 expression is a primary induction phenomenon. Our data demonstrate the stimulus specific induction of NCF/IL-8 in hepatocytes and suggest that cytokine cell-to-cell communication circuits may be important in neutrophil-mediated inflammatory processes in the liver.\r"

  ".W": "Human neutrophils exposed to protein-coated polystyrene or cultured endothelial monolayers produce large quantities of H2O2 in response to soluble stimuli that elicit little or no secretion of reactive oxygen species from cells in suspension. To characterize the mechanisms involved in this adherence-dependent respiratory burst, we have investigated the possible role of one integrin known to participate in the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells, CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1). H2O2 production was examined with chemotactic factor-stimulated human and canine neutrophils exposed to protein-coated surfaces and cultured human and canine endothelial cells. The two protein-coated surfaces used were type I collagen-coated glass or plastic, a surface to which neither human nor canine neutrophils adhered, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-coated glass or plastic, a surface to which human and canine neutrophils adhered only after chemotactic stimulation. FMLP-stimulated human neutrophils and platelet activating factor-stimulated canine neutrophils failed to produce detectable H2O2 when in contact with type I collagen, but secreted large amounts of H2O2 when adherent to KLH or endothelial cell monolayers. FMLP-stimulated neutrophils from patients with CD18-deficiency failed to adhere to any of these surfaces and failed to produce H2O2 under these conditions. mAb reactive with CD18 and CD11b were equally effective in markedly inhibiting the adhesion of normal human neutrophils to these surfaces and markedly inhibited the production of H2O2. A mAb reactive with CD18 blocked adhesion of stimulated canine neutrophils, and mAb directed against both CD18 and CD11b blocked H2O2 production by canine neutrophils on KLH and endothelium. A nonbinding mAb and a mAb reactive with CD11a did not inhibit H2O2 production of human cells on KLH or endothelial monolayers, and nonbinding and binding control mAb did not inhibit H2O2 production by canine neutrophils. These results indicate that Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) can mediate adhesion-dependent H2O2 production by human and canine neutrophils exposed to chemotactic factors.\r"

Schistosomes could be converted into activators of the homologous ACP by treatment with phospholipase C. Antibodies to either human or guinea pig decay accelerating factor (DAF), a 70-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored membrane glycoprotein which controls ACP activation on the mammalian cell plasma membrane, bound to the surface of immature schistosomes and immunoprecipitated a molecule of similar molecular mass from detergent extracts of surface iodinated parasites. Phospholipase C treatment drastically reduced the reactivity of the worms with the anti-DAF antibodies. These data suggest that schistosomes evade the ACP by inserting functional host DAF into their surfaces, possibly through adsorption of the molecule's lipophilic diacyglycerol membrane anchor moiety into the outer lipid bilayer of the parasite.\r"

Intravenous immunoglobulin should be considered in the treatment of chronic B19 infection in immunodeficient patients and possibly in the management of other serious B19 infections. Recent advances in the laboratory, especially the increased sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction assay for detecting B19 DNA and the development of a cell line that produces B19 proteins in the form of empty capsids, should lead to significant advances in our understanding, treatment, and management of B19 disease in the near future.\r"

Ehrlichia canis causes a pancytopenia in dogs that becomes chronic if untreated. Certain breeds develop severe infections, characterized by fever, anorexia, dramatic weight loss, marked pancytopenia, anemia, peripheral edema, and hemorrhage. Ehrlichia risticii, a recently discovered species, is the cause of a serious diarrheal disease of horses. Other species of ehrlichiae have been documented as being veterinary pathogens. Recent data indicate that E. canis or a closely related species causes an acute febrile illness in humans. Clinically, the disease is similar to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, except that most patients do not have a rash. Human ehrlichiosis appears to be tickborne and is prevalent primarily in the southern Atlantic and south-central states. A mild from of ehrlichiosis has also been documented.\r"

Most TWAR infections are mild or asymptomatic, but occasionally severe pneumonia with death has been observed. Laboratory diagnosis is not generally available. Vigorous treatment with tetracycline or erythromycin is recommended. Both epidemic and endemic infections have been described in North America and the Nordic Countries. Population prevalence antibody studies suggest that TWAR infection is wide-spread throughout the world, that nearly everyone is infected and reinfected during their life-time, and that infection is common in all ages except those less than 5 years in temperate zone countries. The infection is transmitted from person to person, apparently with a long incubation period.\r"

Patients in whom H. pylori can no longer be identified after ulcer therapy remain in remission for significantly longer than do patients in whom the organism can be found. The data concerning an etiologic role of H. pylori in duodenal ulcer are suggestive but not yet conclusive. Present antimicrobial therapy can suppress but usually cannot eliminate H. pylori.\r"

Experiments aimed at the cloning of the Bcg gene via a \"reverse genetics\" approach have generated a detailed genetic map in the immediate vicinity of the locus, placing Bcg within the reach of long-range eukaryotic cloning techniques. The chromosomal segment around Bcg in the mouse is exactly conserved onto the long arm (q) of human chromosome 2. Linkage of genetic markers from human chromosome 2q with susceptibility to leprosy or tuberculosis would support both the existence of a susceptibility gene in humans and the contention that this susceptibility gene is a homologue of the mouse Bcg locus.\r"

The annual rate of acquisition of HSV infection was similar among vaccine and placebo recipients (10.7% and 8%, respectively) but was higher in initially seronegative subjects (15.5%) than in those with HSV-1 at entry (5.9%). Eleven (79%) of the 14 HSV infections acquired during follow-up were symptomatic. Vaccination elicited ELISA antibody titers to glycoproteins gD2 and gB2 that were only 10% and 5%, respectively, of titers found in persons with recurrent genital HSV-2 infection. This vaccine failed to provide protection from acquisition of genital HSV infection. The lack of efficacy appears to be related, in part, to the poor immunogenicity of the vaccine.\r"

Of these, 105 experienced prodromal symptoms within the study period and applied the medication, of whom 99 could be evaluated for efficacy. Patients were followed with daily clinical assessments and cultures until reepithelialization. The median time to negative virus culture in high-dose recipients was 2.5 days compared with 3.9 days for placebo recipients (P = .023), and a significant dose response was observed (P = .016). Antiviral effects were more prominent in men than women. High-dose recipients also had reduced median duration of symptoms to 2.7 days from 3.7 days for placebo recipients (P = .03), with a significant dose-response relationship (P = .047). Effects on duration of symptoms were more prominent in women. Times to complete reepithelialization in those who applied the drug during the prodromal phase were 5.8 days for high-dose recipients compared with 6.5 days for placebo recipients (P = .053). A multivariate ranked linear model analysis of four efficacy variables (crusting, healing, virus shedding, symptom duration) also favored the high-dose gel (P = .015). High-dose topical interferon-alpha preparation is effective for patients with recurrent genital herpes. Applied early in the course of a recurrent episode, this treatment is safe and may provide a topical alternative to other types of therapy in the future.\r"

The greater virulence of wild-type A strains over type B and C viruses was reflected in the higher production of infectious virus progeny and subsequent cytopathology, even though the expression of viral antigens was equivalent for all strains tested. These included A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) and A/Rochester/1/82 (H3N2), B/Hong Kong/72, and C/Ann Arbor/1/50. The attenuated cold-adapted and temperature-sensitive variant of A/Ann Arbor/6/60 behaved like its parent except that a longer period was needed to reach peak viral release. In contrast, the avirulent host-range reassortant CR-43-3 did not productively replicate, though viral antigen expression was comparable to that of the other strains. Type C virus infected few cells and these continued to release low virus levels in the absence of detectable cytopathology. The results suggest that the ability of certain strains to infect and replicate in alveolar macrophages can be correlated to their in vivo virulence and may play a role in determining the course of viral pathogenesis.\r"

Increased levels of serum creatinine and serum beta 2-microglobulin were documented in 96% and 99% of the patients, respectively. The mean of the lowest estimated GFR was 26 ml/min. Proximal tubular reabsorptive capacity was assessed by urinary loss of beta 2-microglobulin and cell damage by urinary activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. Both of these parameters were elevated in most of the patients during the acute phase of the disease. Increased serum levels of Tamm-Horsfall-specific IgG and/or IgA occurred in 72 of 74 patients. No patient required dialysis and there was no mortality. Six months after discharge only three patients had a GFR less than 80 ml/min as estimated by [51Cr]EDTA clearance; two of these had underlying chronic diseases and one had suffered clinically severe NE. Desmopressin tests showed decreased urine osmolarity in three patients 8 months after discharge. These three had chronic diseases, which may have contributed to the impaired tubular function. Thus, there was a markedly decreased GFR and a tubular dysfunction in the acute phase of NE. Most patients recovered within a few months and none showed evidence of chronically impaired renal function due to NE.\r"

Synthesis of type-specific polysaccharide (TPS) was increased in the invasive isolates and their respective LD variants compared with the colonizing strains and their LD subpopulations. Production of capsular TPS correlated directly with synthesis of soluble TPS; there was an inverse exponential relationship between soluble TPS production and buoyant density. LD variants were more resistant to phagocytic killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) than were the original strains and HD variants. In a luminol-enhanced chemoluminescence assay, LD variants elicited a weak, slow response. In contrast, the HD subpopulations evoked a prompt, strong respiratory burst in the PMNL.\r"

Human IgG-binding activity was observed among nearly all impetigo isolates examined. In addition, the expression of the class II M protein molecule (one of two broad antigenic classes of the major virulence factor) and opacity factor (a lipoproteinase) was almost invariably accompanied by human IgG binding, regardless of tissue site of infection.

Because 60% of these patients were hyperglycemic, the effect of glucose on receptor expression was investigated. As assessed by flow cytometry, yeasts grown in 20 mM D-glucose exhibited a four- to six-fold increase in receptor expression compared with yeasts grown in 20 mM L-glutamate. Receptor expression increased as glucose concentration rose from 0 to 20 mM (equivalent to plasma glucose concentrations of 0-360 mg/dl). Augmentation of receptor expression by growth in glucose led to significant inhibition of phagocytosis compared with that of organisms grown in equimolar L-glutamate. SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodetection of extracts of yeast cell wall, membrane, and cytosol disclosed a protein of 165 kDa in membrane and cytosolic extracts, consistent with the published Mr of the alpha-chain of neutrophil CR3. These studies provide a mechanism to explain the predilection of C. albicans to infect the hyperglycemic host.\r"

Aerobactin production was detected in 76% of blood and in 73% of urinary isolates but in only 52% of fecal isolates (P less than .01). A reciprocal relationship was found in blood isolates between aerobactin and hemolysin; the majority of blood isolates (55%) that lacked aerobactin were hemolytic, whereas only 14% of blood isolates that expressed aerobactin were hemolytic (P less than .0001). Aerobactin may be the principal mechanism of iron acquisition in extraintestinal isolates of E. coli, and hemolysin may serve as an alternative mechanism in the absence of aerobactin genes.\r"

To investigate sources, Shigella isolates and epidemiologic data were collected for 79 cases of infection with Shigella sonnei, the most common species. Since S. sonnei has a single serotype, plasmid isolation was attempted to refine the epidemiologic analysis. There were seven plasmid patterns containing 17, 13, 4, 22, 9, 2, and 3 isolates. Twelve of 17 isolates associated with recent travel to Mexico were in a group distinguished by a 5.1-kilobase (kb) plasmid. This plasmid was used to probe Southern blots of plasmids from strains of all groups. The Mexico-related plasmid probe hybridized to all the 5.1-kb plasmids and to 5.5- and 7.4-kb plasmids from three other groups. Of the 79 isolates, 50 contained plasmids homologous to the Mexico-related plasmid probe, suggesting association with travel to Mexico.\r"

Comparing men and women, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders was higher in women. The exception was alcohol abuse/dependence, which was much higher among men, as was antisocial personality disorder. Comparison of prevalence by age groups showed that, in contrast to American studies, there was a tendency for prevalence to increase with increasing age. Alcohol abuse/dependence was much higher in rural Korea compared with St. Louis. Drug abuse/dependence was much higher in St. Louis. Other interesting similarities and differences are discussed.\r"

Three patients benefited from the slow-release preparation; two patients deteriorated with a tendency to have an unpredictable response, a delay to turn \"on\" with the first dose in the morning, as well as an increase in dyskinesia corresponding to L-dopa cumulation during the day. These problems were subsequently also seen during the follow-up period of 1 year in those patients who benefited from Madopar HBS as inpatients. This might indicate that patient compliance is more difficult with the new formulation. After 1 year all patients had returned to their previous standard L-dopa/PDI treatment. L-Dopa levels continued to fluctuate, but to a lesser degree with Madopar HBS. The equivalent L-dopa dosage had to be increased by 56% (29-100%) with Madopar HBS while mean dopamine levels increased in four patients (by 47-257%) without the occurrence of peripheral side-effects. This implies that with the new formulation more L-dopa is metabolized to dopamine and explains the necessity to increase the equivalent L-dopa dosage.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of electrical stimulation on a chronically denervated muscle depends on stimulus parameters, which have an important influence on the development of atrophy. Stimulus frequency and/or total activity are particularly responsible for the development of some histological, biochemical and contractile features. The present study in 18 rabbits deals with a recently developed electrical stimulus, which had proved effective in maintaining muscle force following denervation. This current has (1) unusual long bidirectional rectangular impulses (20 ms) and (2) a frequency of 25 Hz, which is between the frequencies of fast- and slow-firing motor units. Electrical stimulation began 28 (in one animal 53) days after total motor and sensory denervation of the right hindleg, and was continued until the end of the experiment, up to 205 days. To mimic a therapeutic regimen, which should be agreeable to patients, daily treatment times were kept to a minimum (2 x 6 min), and surface electrodes were used. Morphometric evaluation of the fast flexor digitorum sublimis muscle showed that such electrical stimulation was able to preserve fibre diameter at a level of 72-86% of the initial values for several months, while unstimulated fibres showed the usual atrophy with a decrease of diameters below 40% of normal. The stimulation induced a \"hybrid\" fibre type with properties of a slow muscle (rich in mitochondria in NADH-dependent tetrazolium reductase staining and electron microscopy) as well as of a fast-twitch muscle (fibre type IIb in myofibrillar ATPase stainings).\r"

In the present study we focussed on the geographical variation in serum concentrations of free testosterone and its relation to measures of obesity, fat distribution and indicators of cardiovascular risk (serum lipids, insulin, and blood pressure). There were significant differences in free testosterone levels (F = 5.4, p less than 0.001) with lowest levels in Polish women (mean +/- SEM: 1.56 +/- 0.08 pg/ml) and highest in women from Italy (2.07 +/- 0.12 pg/ml). In the pooled data, free testosterone levels were correlated with several anthropometric variables (strongest with subscapular/triceps ratio r = 0.27, with subscapular skinfold and waist/thigh circumference ratio r = 0.25 p-values less than 0.001). In addition, free testosterone was positively correlated with serum total cholesterol (r = 0.11), HDL/total cholesterol fraction (r = 0.12), serum insulin (r = 0.20) and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.15). These associations remained significant after adjustment for body mass index and waist/thigh ratio (not for diastolic blood pressure) but were no longer significant after further adjustment for insulin levels. There were considerable differences in strength of the associations mentioned between the 5 centers. We conclude that degree of obesity, fat distribution and serum levels of free testosterone all, to a limited degree, contribute to the metabolic profile of randomly selected 38-year old women but that adjustment for such variables increases the differences in metabolic profiles between women from different centers of Europe.\r"

The case is described of a 65-year-old man who presented with a 2-year history of mild gait spasticity and vague sensory complaints affecting both lower extremities. Following a diagnostic lumbar puncture, these symptoms progressed painlessly over a 4-day period to total motor paraplegia, urinary retention, and hypesthesia in all modalities with a midthoracic sensory level. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a probable spinal AVM but no evidence of hemorrhage or cord compression. Spinal angiography confirmed the diagnosis of spinal AVM fed by radicular branches of left T-7 and T-8 segmental intercostal arteries. Drainage was via long dorsal veins caudally. Emergency laminectomy with intradural exploration was performed. There was no evidence of prior hemorrhage or focal mass effect, although the cerebrospinal fluid pressure was elevated. The dural component of the spinal AVM was excised, and its communications with the spinal cord were disconnected intradurally. Neurological function started improving within 6 hours of the patient awakening from anesthesia. He had achieved antigravity strength in every muscle group of the lower extremities by the time of discharge to a rehabilitation center 10 days after surgery. Three months postoperatively, he was ambulating with a walker and was continent of urine and stool. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in light of the favorable response to timely surgical intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin E is the term used for eight naturally occurring fat-soluble nutrients called tocopherols. alpha-Tocopherol is essential, has the highest biological activity and predominates in many species. In humans vitamin E is the most important lipid soluble antioxidant and deficiency may cause neurological dysfunction, myopathies and diminished erythrocyte life span. alpha-Tocopherol is absorbed via the lymphatic pathway and transported in association with chylomicrons. In plasma, alpha-tocopherol is found in all lipoprotein fractions but mostly is associated with apo B-containing lipoproteins. alpha-Tocopherol is associated with very-low-density lipoprotein when it is secreted from the liver. In the rat, about 90% of total body mass of alpha-tocopherol is recovered in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Most alpha-tocopherol is located in the mitochondrial fractions and in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas little is found in cytosol and peroxisomes. New clinical evidence from heavy drinkers and from experimental work in rats suggests that alcohol may increase oxidation of alpha-tocopherol. Increased demand for vitamin E has also been observed in premature infants and patients with malabsorption, but there is little evidence that the healthy population requires supplementation of vitamin E to a well-balanced diet.\r"

Control animals were pair-fed and treated with an equal volume of vehicle. PFDA treatment significantly increased Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GSHPx) activity in liver cytosol of rats fed the 0.04 mg of Se/kg of diet but not in rats fed the other diets. The increase in liver cytosolic Se-GSHPx activity in rats fed 0.04 mg of Se/kg of diet paralleled increases in Se content and serum Se-GSHPx activity. Determination of Se-GSHPx by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that PFDA caused a decrease in Se-GSHPx protein in rats fed 0.2 or 1.0 mg of Se/kg of diet but not in rats fed 0.04 mg of Se/kg of diet. Further analysis revealed that the ratio of Se-GSHPx activity to antibody-reactive protein was increased by PFDA in all three groups. The in vitro addition of PFDA directly to the assay mixture for Se-GSHPx activity did not produce any effect. Reduced glutathione was significantly increased by PFDA treatment in all three groups. These data show that PFDA affects the Se content, Se-GSHPx activity and Se-GSHPx protein in rat liver and that the effect is dependent on the dietary/hepatic Se level.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To describe an outbreak of Escherichia coli O175:H7 infection resulting in a high rate of progression to hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and to attempt to identify predictors of and risk factors for progression. DESIGN: Case-control study among employees and comparison of daily clinical features in two groups: infected residents with subsequent development of HUS and those who had no complications. SETTING: Two institutions for retarded persons in Utah. PATIENTS: Twenty residents with E. coli O157:H7 infection (13 culture confirmed, 2 probable, and 5 possible); HUS developed in 8, and 4 died. Thirty-one infected employees (3 with culture-confirmed, 6 with probable, and 22 with possible infection). MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: In a case-control study among employees, infection was independently associated with eating ground beef from a single lot prepared at several barbecues and with close contact with a resident who had diarrhea. Five of eight residents in whom HUS developed had received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, compared with none of seven who had no subsequent complications (p = 0.026); this finding may reflect antimicrobial treatment of patients with more severe illness. Compared with infected residents without complications, persons with HUS were younger (median age 13 vs 27 years, p = 0.043) and, by the third day of illness, had higher leukocyte counts (median 23.7 X 10(9)/L vs 9.1 X 10(9)/L, p = 0.018) and temperature (median 38.5 degrees C vs 37.0 degrees C, p = 0.016). Leukocytosis peaked on day 4, more than 24 hours before signs of HUS appeared. CONCLUSIONS: Food-borne outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in institutions may have devastating effects. Leukocytosis and fever may precede and predict HUS in patients with E. coli O157:H7 infection.\r"

  ".W": "Because cystic fibrosis (CF) epithelia have ion transport abnormalities that may in part be regulated by intracellular calcium metabolism, and the kidney is actively involved in both ion transport and calcium homeostasis, we have investigated renal calcium handling in CF. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were analyzed in 34 CF patients (age 5 to 35 years) and kidney ultrasound studies were performed in 17 CF patients (age 6 months to 23 years). Renal histologic findings at postmortem examination of 14 CF patients (age 4 months to 23 years) were compared with those of 12 patients (age 11 months to 17 years) with other chronic illnesses (6 congenital heart disease, 6 malignancy). In 30 of the 34 CF patients urinary calcium excretion was normal (less than 4 mg (0.1 mmol)/kg/24 hr). Four CF patients had hypercalciuria (calcium excretion 4.4 to 8.8 mg (0.11 to 0.22 mmol)/kg/24 hr). However, these patients had other possible explanations for hypercalciuria, such as immobilization (n = 2), increased dietary sodium load (n = 1), and glucocorticoid therapy (n = 1). None of the 17 patients examined by renal ultrasonography had nephrocalcinosis. Five CF patients had histologic evidence of sparse nephrocalcinosis at autopsy. However, 6 of 12 autopsy kidney specimens from patients with other chronic illnesses and similar preterminal events also showed nephrocalcinosis. The hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis in CF and other chronic debilitating diseases may be explained by factors known to affect calcium handling. Our evidence does not support a primary renal defect as the basis of hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis in CF.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the clinical significance of a reactive urine latex agglutination (LA) test in neonates without bacteriologically confirmed group B streptococcal (GBS) infection. In a retrospective review of a 3 1/2-month period, during which 367 urine specimens from newborn infants evaluated for suspected sepsis were tested by LA, 25 infants (6.9%) with sterile blood cultures but positive urine LA test results were compared with a control group of 112 infants with both blood cultures and urine LA test results negative for GBS. When the data were studied with stepwise discriminant analysis, the only variables significantly associated with a positive urine LA test result were immature to total neutrophil ratios greater than or equal to 0.16 at 0 and 12 hours. The influence of mucosal GBS colonization on urine LA test results was then investigated prospectively in 98 healthy infants (83 born to mothers colonized with GBS and 15 born to mothers with negative GBS cultures). Eight (8.2%) of the infants studied, or 8 of 52 (15.4%) infants colonized with GBS, had a positive urine LA test result. GBS was isolated from urine cultures of all infants with a positive urine LA test result. A positive urine LA test result was associated with positive GBS rectal and vaginal cultures and with increased density of colonization at those sites. We conclude that contamination of bag specimens of urine with GBS from perineal and rectal colonization may produce a positive urine LA test result in an infant with no systemic sign of infection.\r"

All children without cerebral palsy were entered as controls subjects in the analysis. Significant prenatal or gestational predictors of cerebral palsy were a severe or nonsevere birth defect other than cerebral palsy or its sequelae, low birth weight, low placental weight, abnormal fetal position, and premature separation of the placenta. Maternal antecedents of cerebral palsy were unusually long or unusually short intervals between pregnancies and unusually long menstrual cycles. Perinatal risk factors were delayed crying as a measure of birth asphyxia and abnormal delivery. Children who had seizures within 48 hours of birth were at high risk for the development of cerebral palsy. Seventy-eight percent of children with cerebral palsy did not have birth asphyxia, and the 22% who did had other prenatal risk factors that may have compromised their recovery.\r"

  ".W": "Because several human hematopoietic growth factors have been identified and shown to be effective for treatment of congenital or iatrogenic neutropenias, and cord blood contains stimulatory activities for blood-forming cells, we postulated that identification of these factors and analysis of their regulatory role in normal neonates would provide a rationale for their use in treating neonatal infections associated with neutropenia. We studied the plasma levels of granulocyte and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF, respectively) and the frequency of granulomonopoietic colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) in the umbilical cord blood of normal term neonates. Plasma growth factor levels were measured by a biologic assay. Circulating hematopoietic progenitors were assayed for colony formation with different recombinant growth factors used as exogenous growth stimulators. The cell cycle status of these progenitors was analyzed by the thymidine suicide technique. At birth the leukocyte count (mean +/- SD) was 11.0 +/- 3.9 x 10(9)L and the neutrophil count was 5.6 +/- 2.6 x 10(9)/L. The incidence of CFU-GM was significantly higher in umbilical cord blood than in normal adult peripheral blood (p less than 0.005) with up to 40% of the cells in S phase (less than 10% in normal adults). Plasma levels of G-CSF and GM-CSF at birth were 40.8 +/- 2.8 U/ml and 19.9 +/- 5.2 U/ml, respectively (normal adult plasma levels 2.5 +/- 1.5 U/ml for G-CSF and undetectable for GM-CSF). These high levels of G-CSF and GM-CSF in umbilical cord blood of normal neonates might play a role in maintaining adequate neutrophil production.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. SETTING: Patients' residence and university hospital clinic. PATIENTS: One hundred five children between 5 and 16 years of age with laboratory-confirmed varicella entered the study. Of the 102 who were included in the final analysis, 50 received acyclovir and 52 received placebo. INTERVENTION: Placebo or acyclovir was given orally four times daily, for 5 to 7 days. The acyclovir dose was adjusted as follows: 5 to 7 years of age, 20 mg/kg; 7 to 12 years, 15 mg/kg; and 12 to 16 years, 10 mg/kg. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Acyclovir recipients, compared with the placebo group, defervesced sooner (median, 1 day vs 2 days; p = 0.001), experienced onset of cutaneous healing sooner, as reflected by a decrease in number of lesions (median, 3 days vs 2 days; p = 0.002), and had fewer skin lesions (median, 500 vs 336; p = 0.02). Acyclovir did not significantly change the rate of complications of varicella (10% in the acyclovir group vs 13.5% among placebo subjects). Adverse drug effects were not observed. Acyclovir recipients had lower geometric mean serum antibody titers to varicella-zoster virus than their placebo counterparts 4 weeks after the onset of illness, but antibody titers in both groups were similar 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that acyclovir is useful and well tolerated for treatment of varicella in otherwise healthy children.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-five children with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection were enrolled in a 12-week, three-center phase I study of intravenous and oral zidovudine therapy. At enrollment the children ranged in age from 5 months to 13 years, with a median age of 3 1/2 years. Twenty-one children (60%) had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and 14 (40%) had the related complex; 20 children had less than 0.5 10(9) CD4+ lymphocytes per liter (less than 500 cells/mm3) at entry. Zidovudine was administered in one of three escalating dose regimens. One or two months of intravenous treatment with zidovudine every 6 hours was followed by orally administered drug on the same schedule; zidovudine was infused at 80, 120, or 160 mg/m2/dose, and the oral dose was one and one-half times the intravenous dosage. Adverse events were similar to those observed in adults. Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 0.75 10(9)/L (750 cells/mm3] occurred in nine patients. The median neutrophil count fell from 2.50 10(9)/L at entry to 1.72 10(9)/L at the end of the study. Anemia requiring transfusion occurred in seven 10(9)/L at the end of the study. Anemia requiring transfusion occurred in seven patients; the median hemoglobin level among nontransfused patients decreased from an entry value of 108 to 105 gm/L (10.8 to 10.5 gm/dl). Dosage adjustments were made in 15 patients, in 12 because of anemia or neutropenia. No patients required permanent discontinuation of zidovudine because of toxic effects. Positive effects included a faster-than-anticipated rate of weight gain, decreased hepatosplenomegaly, and lowering of the total IgG and IgM concentrations toward more normal values. Zidovudine appears to be safe and to have manageable toxic effects in children.\r"

Of 10 infants, two had a short-term response to placebo, 8 of 10 infants to theophylline, and 7 of 11 infants to doxapram (placebo vs treatment with theophylline or doxapram: p = 0.01). The two infants who initially responded to placebo remained responsive for the duration of the study. Of the eight infants in whom treatment with placebo failed, five were randomly assigned to receive theophylline, for a total of 15 infants treated with theophylline, and two of the eight were randomly assigned to receive doxapram, for a total of 13 infants treated with doxapram; the remaining infant required tracheal intubation. Of the 15 infants randomly assigned to receive theophylline, seven responded for the duration of the study; of the eight infants who did not respond to treatment with theophylline, five responded to doxapram, one responded to a combination of theophylline and doxapram, and two remained resistant to treatment. Of the 13 infants randomly assigned to receive doxapram four responded for the duration of the study; of the nine who did not respond to doxapram, seven responded to theophylline, one responded to a combination of theophylline and doxapram, and one remained resistant to treatment. This study demonstrates that although therapy with theophylline or doxapram is associated with a significant short-term reduction in the incidence of apnea compared with that in placebo-treated infants, the long-term response to treatment is frequently incomplete and is not sustained more than 1 week.\r"

The pD2 value of BK on the longitudinal muscle was 6.58 +/- 0.06 M. The maximal response of the longitudinal muscle to BK was 44% compared to carbachol. The putative B1 agonist des-Arg9-BK produced contraction of longitudinal muscle but the putative B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg9-[Leu8]-BK (20 and 50 microM) did not modify the responses to BK or des-Arg9-BK. The putative B2 antagonists d-Phe7-BK, Thi5,8-d-Phe7-BK and d-Arg0-Hyp3-Thi5,8-d-Phe7-BK (B6572) were found to be agonists in this tissue. The rank order of potency with respect to Emax obtained from cumulative concentration-response curves was BK greater than Thi5,8-d-Phe7-BK greater than B6572 greater than d-Phe7-BK and pD2 values of these compounds were 6.58 +/- 0.06, 6.30 +/- 0.28, 6.74 +/- 0.08 and 5.05 +/- 0.04 M, respectively. The excitatory effect of BK and Thi5,8-d-Phe7-BK was not modified by tetrodotoxin (1 and 10 microM), atropine (1 microM) or indomethacin (1 and 10 microM), but was significantly (P less than .001) inhibited by nifedipine (1 and 10 microM). Three putative \"tissue selective\" BK antagonists, d-Phe2,7-BK (B4404), d-Phe7-Hyp8-BK and Phe2-d-Phe7-BK also had an agonistic effect on longitudinal muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Indomethacin attenuated endothelin (less than or equal to 10 nM) on guinea pig trachea, but not on the rat tissues. This indicates that part of the effect of endothelin on guinea pig trachea is indirect and mediated by cyclooxygenase products. Endothelin (direct effects) was more potent on pulmonary artery than on guinea pig or rat trachea (negative log EC50 values: 8.42, 7.71 and 7.76, respectively) and was also a more effective spasmogen on pulmonary artery (maximum was the tissue maximum, i.e., greater than or equal to 80 mM K+) than on trachea (maximum was 60-70% of the tissue maximum to 10 microM carbachol). Pinacidil was less effective preventing (anti-spasmogenic) than reversing (spasmolytic) contractions to endothelin on either tissue type. This is compatible with different mechanisms for the initiation and maintenance of smooth muscle contraction in these tissues. As a spasmolytic against endothelin (0.03 microM), pinacidil was less potent on rat pulmonary artery than on guinea pig or rat trachea (negative log IC50 values: 4.45, 5.65 and 5.49, respectively). This may reflect 1) the greater tone induced by endothelin on pulmonary artery, 2) a smaller receptor reserve for endothelin in trachea and/or 3) a different mechanism whereby endothelin contracts pulmonary vascular smooth muscle compared with tracheal smooth muscle.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted s.c. under light ether anesthesia with 6 morphine pellets, each containing 75 mg of morphine free base. Rats serving as controls were implanted with placebo pellets. This procedure resulted in the development of tolerance to morphine as evidenced by decreased analgesic response to a challenge dose of morphine. Similarly, the development of physical dependence was evidenced by decreased body weight and colonic temperature after morphine pellet removal (withdrawal). Two sets of animals were used for receptor binding studies. In one, the pellets were left intact and in the other, the pellets were removed. Eighteen hours after pellet removal, the rats were sacrificed. [3H]SCH 23390 [( R-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1-3-benzapine- 7-ol]) bound to brain region and spinal cord membranes of placebo pellet-implanted rats at a single high affinity site. In rats treated chronically with morphine and then withdrawn, the binding of [3H]SCH 23390 to membranes of spinal cord, hypothalamus and striatum was increased but the binding to amygdalar membranes was decreased in comparison with placebo-treated rats. The changes in binding were due to the changes in Bmax values; the Kd values were unaffected. The behavioral responses to a selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist, SKF 38393 [( 1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro (1H)-3-benzapine-7,8-diol hydrochloride]), were also enhanced in morphine-withdrawn rats when compared to placebo controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin stimulates the release of arachidonic acid in vascular smooth muscle cells, raising the possibility that eicosanoid metabolites of arachidonic acid may be involved in mediating the contractile effects of endothelin. We have investigated the hypothesis that endothelin-1 stimulates formation of thromboxane A2 in rat aorta and that this thromboxane A2 mediates part of the contractile response to endothelin-1. Preincubation of rat aorta with 10 microM SQ 29,548, a \"selective\" antagonist of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TP) receptors, caused a rightward shift in the dose-response curve and a reduction in the maximal response to endothelin-1. Preincubation with SQ 29,548 had no effect on the dose-response curves to either norepinephrine or KCl. In rings of rat aorta that had been precontracted with 1 nM endothelin-1, addition of either 10 microM SQ 29,548 or 10 microM indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor) caused a relaxation of 50-65% of developed tension. The inhibitory effect of SQ 29,548 on endothelin-induced contraction was greater when it was added after endothelin than when added before endothelin, suggesting that activation of the TP receptor may be more important in the maintenance of developed tension than in the initiation of contraction. Finally, 100 nM endothelin-1 stimulated the indomethacin-sensitive formation of thromboxane A2 in rings of rat aorta. These results suggest that a significant portion of the sustained contraction induced by endothelin in rat aorta requires the persistent activation of the TP receptor by a cyclooxygenase product, most likely thromboxane A2 or prostaglandin H2.\r"

  ".W": "The opioid agonists morphine, l-methadone, ethylketazocine, U50,488 and bremazocine were examined in squirrel monkeys responding under a schedule of shock titration before, during and after chronic morphine administration. Before chronic morphine administration, all drugs produced dose-dependent increases in median shock level (the intensity below which monkeys maintained shock 50% of the time). After approximately 6 weeks of daily morphine administration, dose-effect curves for the mu agonist morphine shifted to the right approximately 3/4 log unit. Dose-effect curves for the mu agonist l-methadone also shifted to the right, approximately 1/4 log unit. In contrast, dose-effect curves for the kappa agonist ethylketazocine did not shift during chronic morphine administration, whereas those for the kappa agonists U50,488 and bremazocine shifted to the left approximately 1/2 log unit. After termination of daily morphine administration, dose-effect curves returned toward their prechronic positions. The present study demonstrates that repeated administration of morphine produces tolerance to its antinociceptive effects, as well as cross-tolerance selective to other opioids possessing mu agonist properties. Morphine tolerance may be a useful procedure not only for distinguishing mu from kappa opioid antinociceptive activity in the squirrel monkey, but also for differentiating among kappa opioids that have varying degrees of mu agonist and antagonist activity.\r"

  ".W": "The proposed noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate] has therapeutic potential as an anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant. Previous research has demonstrated that MK-801 shares many of the biochemical and pharmacological actions of the abused drug phencyclidine (PCP). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether rhesus monkeys would self-administer i.v. MK-801 and to determine whether MK-801 has discriminative stimulus properties similar to those of PCP. Four Rhesus monkeys were trained to press response levers according to fixed-ratio 10 schedules of reinforcement for infusions of cocaine (33 micrograms/kg/injection) or PCP (10 micrograms/kg/injection). Various doses of MK-801 were evaluated during substitution tests to determine whether they would maintain lever pressing. None of the four rhesus monkeys tested self-administered MK-801 when it was offered to them after a recent history of cocaine self-administration. Three of the four monkeys, however, did self-administer MK-801 when provided a history of PCP self-administration. All four rhesus monkeys given drug discrimination training with 80 micrograms/kg PCP and tested with MK-801 generalized from the PCP stimulus in a dose-dependent manner. MK-801 was about 2 to 3 times more potent and had a longer duration of action than PCP. Overall, these results provide further evidence in a primate species of similarities in the behavioral effects of MK-801 and PCP, and suggest that MK-801 may have abuse potential of the PCP type.\r"

  ".W": "To describe the microbiologic etiology of post-cesarean endometritis developing after perioperative cephalosporin prophylaxis, endometrial samples were obtained from 27 women with a triple-lumen catheter. The women were assigned in a double-blind, randomized fashion to receive either ticarcillin/clavulanate, 3.1 g, or cefoxitin, 2 g, administered every six hours, until the clinical signs of infection resolved. A total of 149 microorganisms (84 facultative and 65 obligate anaerobes) were recovered from 26 women, for a mean of 5.5 isolates per specimen. One endometrial specimen was sterile. Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus species were the most frequent isolates, followed by Gardnerella vaginalis, Enterococcus, facultative gram-negative rods and Mycoplasma hominis. Each of the isolates was tested for beta-lactamase activity. At least one beta-lactamase-producing isolate was recovered from 56% of the specimens. Susceptibility testing of endometrial isolates demonstrated that 96% of 118 potential pathogens (Gardnerella, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, enterococci and streptococci) were susceptible to ticarcillin/clavulanate. By comparison, 86% of these isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin in vitro. Women who were treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate were less likely to have a temperature greater than 38 degrees C for two or more days (8% vs. 57%, P = .01). Also, there was a trend toward a decreased duration of uterine tenderness in the ticarcillin/clavulanate group, but it did not attain statistical significance (60% vs. 86%, P = .4). However, the overall clinical success rate with these single-agent treatments was not different for the two groups (77% vs. 79%, P = 1.0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To make a significant impact on the acute and chronic morbidity associated with PID, experts currently recommend aggressive hospitalization and parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Antibiotic therapy, in the 1989 recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control, includes broad-spectrum cephalosporins active against penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae and the mixed aerobic and anaerobic genital flora, with concomitant administration of doxycycline for possible or proven infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. An alternative regimen consists of the \"gold standard\" combination of clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside. However, with the availability of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations, such as ticarcillin/clavulanate and ampicillin/sulbactam, which have modest to very good activity against all these classes of bacteria, the gynecologist has the capability to utilize single-agent antibiotic regimens to adequately treat this potentially devastating sexually transmitted disease.\r"

Because of increasing resistance, ampicillin or a sulfonamide alone is no longer recommended for the empiric treatment of those infections. Antimicrobial therapy that contains a beta-lactamase inhibitor or that is resistant to the action of beta-lactamase is preferred. For the treatment of acute, uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in a young woman, a short course of therapy (single dose) may be adequate. For an upper tract or complicated infection a longer course of therapy is advised. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy should be treated; a short course of therapy with a beta-lactam antibiotic may be tried only if posttherapy follow-up cultures are planned. When bacteriuria persists or recurs, a longer course of therapy should follow, with consideration given to a urologic workup after delivery.\r"

The 129 who completed an initial course of treatment with ticarcillin/clavulanate were analyzed according to type and clinical severity of infection, and pretreatment and posttreatment endometrial bacteriology. There were 26 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease and 103 puerperal infections, 61 of which occurred in women who had delivered by cesarean section (46 elective with no antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of surgery). Of the 129 patients treated, 124 were clinically cured, and one improved (97%). There were four treatment failures, all of which were among a total of 20 cases classified as clinically severe. All the patients designated as treatment failures required prolonged treatment with other antibacterials to achieve a clinical cure, but a longer duration of treatment with ticarcillin/clavulanate might have effected a clinical resolution even in these cases. In vitro examination of endometrial isolates revealed a significant reduction of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria with the addition of clavulanate to ticarcillin. The relationship of non-beta-lactamase-producing enterococci having relatively high MICs to clinical failure was examined.\r"

Broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy is dictated by the polymicrobial nature of infections encountered in gynecologic oncology and is imperative in the empiric therapy of febrile granulocytopenic patients. In addition, the potential for infectious complications after radical pelvic surgery to remove malignancies has influenced most gynecologic oncologists to recommend prophylactic antibiotics. However, the choice of appropriate antibacterial therapy in gynecologic oncology patients is complicated frequently by impaired renal function secondary to cancer chemotherapy or associated with age in this generally elderly population. In addition, the potential cost- and time-saving advantages of simplified antibacterial regimens have resulted in a reexamination of the standard aminoglycoside-containing multiple-drug regimens. The efficacy and safety of monotherapy with broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics or beta-lactam-antibiotic/beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations, such as ticarcillin/clavulanate, remain to be confirmed in gynecologic oncology patients. The broad spectrum of ticarcillin/clavulanate, including gram-negative and -positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, seems plausible for the treatment of these potentially devastating infections.\r"

Clindamycin plus gentamicin has been the principal antibiotic combination utilized for treatment of these infections.

The results revealed a marked reduction in CD4+2H4+ cells (suppressor inducer T cells) and an increment in CD4+4B4+ cells (helper T cells) among CD4+ cells in synovial tissue. The percentage of CD8+CD11b+ cells (suppressor effector T cells) was significantly lower in synovial tissue than in peripheral blood from patients with RA, resulting in an increased percentage of CD8+CD11b-- cells (cytotoxic T cells). The synovial tissue had higher percentages of pan B cells (B1+ cells), differentiated B cells (B1+B2-- cells) and plasma cells (PCA-1+ cells). These findings suggest that a combination of the increment in helper T cells, the reduction in suppressor T cells, and the increment in differentiated B cells may lead to excessive production of autoantibodies.\r"

Because studies on diet are susceptible to bias from a number of sources, in this review we evaluated the adequacy of study methodology as well as study results to clarify how much protection, if any, is conferred by a high-fiber diet. The review consisted of an aggregate assessment of the strength of evidence from 37 observational epidemiologic studies as well as meta-analyses of data from 16 of the 23 case-control studies. Both types of analyses revealed that the majority of studies gave support for a protective effect associated with fiber-rich diets; an estimated combined odds ratio (OR) of 0.57 (95% confidence interval = 0.50, 0.64) was obtained when the highest and lowest quantiles of intake were compared. Risk estimates based on vegetable consumption (OR = 0.48) were only slightly more convincing than those based on an estimate of fiber intake (OR = 0.58), but the data do not permit discrimination between effects due to fiber and nonfiber effects due to vegetables.\r"

Results of this phase I trial revealed that escalated MVAC (30 mg of methotrexate/m2, 4 mg of vinblastine/m2, 60 mg of doxorubicin/m2, and 100 mg of cisplatin/m2) can be tolerated by heavily pretreated patients. The side effects of rhGM-CSF are dose- and schedule-dependent. The maximum tolerated dose is 250 micrograms/m2 per day as a single dose administered subcutaneously (SC) for 10 consecutive days. This dose is well tolerated in outpatients, resulting in only modest fever and few side effects. The same dose delivered as a continuous infusion or a higher dose delivered either as a continuous infusion or SC caused significant side effects. For phase II trials, the starting dose of rhGM-CSF when combined with escalated MVAC is 120 micrograms/m2 per day SC for 10 consecutive days. forty percent of the treated patients responded, seven (23%) with complete remission and five (17%) with partial remission.

  ".W": "We evaluated the toxic, hematopoietic, and immunomodulatory effects of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF). The rHuGM-CSF was administered at doses up to 50 micrograms/kg by daily 2-hour intravenous infusions to 11 patients with advanced malignancy. It induced dose-related increases in cells of the myeloid series, but it had no significant effect on reticulocyte or platelet counts. Bone marrow cellularity increased with higher doses of rHuGM-CSF, but there was a dose-related decrease in the number of colony-forming units--granulocyte-monocyte--and colony-forming units--granulocyte-erythrocyte-monocyte-megakaryocyte--per 10(5) bone marrow cells. The rHuGM-CSF caused transient increased expression of CD11b and CD16 on granulocytes but increased expression of HLA-DR and decreased expression of the high-affinity Fc receptor on monocytes and no change in monocyte production of H2O2. Thus, rHuGM-CSF has potent effects on granulocyte, eosinophil, and monocyte numbers in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. In addition, it enhances the expression of monocyte and granulocyte activation-associated surface markers.\r"

  ".U": "90204579\r", 
  ".W": "We performed a phase I-II trial of escalating doses of cisplatin (CDDP: 50-100 mg/m2 per course) plus carboplatin (CBDCA: 300-400 mg/m2 per course) as a potential way in which to maximize platinum doses without causing excessive toxic effects in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Thirty-three patients with nonoptimally debulked disease of FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stages IIc-IV [median age: 60 yr; median WHO (World Health Organization) performance status: 2; no prior chemotherapy] received a median of six courses of therapy. CBDCA was infused on day 1 and CDDP on day 2 with an aggressive 48-hour hydration regimen. Myelosuppression was dose-limiting: at the highest dose levels, WHO grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia led to dose reduction and/or treatment delay in 45% of the patients. Nonhematologic toxic effects included acute nausea and vomiting (97% of the patients), mild alopecia (45%), ototoxic effects (39%), neurotoxic effects (21%), and renal toxic effects (serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL: 12.5%). The pathologic complete response rate was 22%. We conclude that CBDCA and CDDP can be given safely in combination at reasonably high doses (CBDCA at 300 mg/m2 per course and CDDP at 100 mg/m2 per course) over a 6-month period, provided a close hematologic follow-up is conducted. Randomized clinical trials are needed to define whether this regimen is any better than standard combination chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the efficacy of adenoidectomy in 213 children who had received tympanostomy-tube placement because of persistent and/or recurrent otitis media and had again developed otitis media after tubal extrusion. Ninety-nine of the children were assigned randomly to either an adenoidectomy group or a control group; in a separate trial, 114 children whose parents withheld consent for randomization were assigned according to parental preference. In both trials, control group outcomes appeared to have been biased favorably by the withdrawal of certain severely affected subjects from control status to receive adenoidectomy. Nonetheless, in both trials, adenoidectomy group outcomes were more favorable than control group outcomes during the first 2 follow-up years. Statistically significant differences were found mainly in the randomized trial, where during the first and second years, respectively, adenoidectomy subjects had 47% and 37% less time with otitis media than control subjects and 28% and 35% fewer suppurative (acute) episodes than control subjects. We conclude that adenoidectomy is warranted on an individualized basis for children who develop recurrent otitis media after extrusion of tympanostomy tubes.\r"
