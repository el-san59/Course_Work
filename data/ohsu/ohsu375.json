  ".W": "An interaction among leukocytes, platelets and endothelial cells is important in atherogenesis and in maintenance of blood flow and vascular tone. These complex cell-cell interactions are mediated by release of such metabolic substances as arachidonic acid metabolites, growth factors, oxygen free radicals and endothelium-derived relaxing factor. These substances participate in the regulation of blood flow in health and disease, and perturbation in the delicate equilibrium among various cellular elements may lead to evolution and propagation of myocardial ischemia. During reperfusion of ischemic myocardium, neutrophils together with platelets cause capillary plugging in the coronary microcirculation and exert detrimental effects on endothelial function resulting in the \"no reflow\" phenomenon, ventricular arrythmias, loss of coronary vascular reserve and, perhaps, extension of cellular injury. This review addresses the mechanisms of cell-cell interactions with special reference to myocardial ischemia and the potential for development of improved therapy to protect and preserve ischemic myocardium.\r"

We used 106 virgin Sprague-Dawley rats which, on the evening of proestrus, received ultrasonic radiation of sham treatment after the onset of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. No differences were found between control (C) and experimental (US) animals in pregnancy rate, number of corpora lutea, implantations, pups, and mean pup and placental weights at autopsy on day 22 of pregnancy. Ultrasonic radiation applied to meiotically active, preovulatory oocytes did not affect the reproductive performance of these rats.\r"

Each physician completed 6.5 days of course work and ultrasound laboratory apprenticeship prior to beginning a clinical preceptorship of approximately 14 months' duration. During the clinical preceptorship the physicians performed ultrasound studies in their own offices. All studies were reviewed by a local consultant radiologist utilizing examination data sheets and videotapes. At the conclusion of the training program, the physicians took a combined practical and written proficiency examination administered by an independent sonographer. Eight physicians completed the training, performing during the preceptorship an average of 78 examinations. The rated performance of the physicians improved markedly over the course of the preceptorship. During the last segment of the preceptorship the radiologist preceptors rated 94 percent of the ultrasound studies as acceptable, compared with 79 percent rated acceptable at the beginning of the preceptorship. Seven of the eight physicians completing the protocol took the proficiency examination: all passed. This study can provide a blueprint for an individual family physician to design his own training, or it can guide an academic department of family medicine in developing and evaluating ultrasound training programs for residents and practicing physicians.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term survival in breast cancer currently rests on detection and appropriate therapy at the earliest possible stage, with survival being excellent in patients whose cancers are discovered at a small size and without dissemination. Discovery of lesions at the smallest possible size is therefore desirable. Of the available imaging modalities, only modern mammography has been shown consistently to detect small breast lesions. The efficacy of screening mammography in asymptomatic women has been demonstrated in large-scale trials in women older than 49 years of age and has been strongly supported by follow-up results in the Breast Cancer Detection and Demonstration Project in women aged 40 to 50 years. Mammographic screening has been advocated by the American Cancer Society (ACS) beginning at 40 years of age, while the National Cancer Institute recommends mammographic screening beginning at 50 years of age. The ACS recommends also that breast self-examination begin at 20 years of age. Unfortunately, a great majority of women do not practice breast self-examination, nor do they know that mammography is useful in detecting breast cancer. Further, only a minority of physicians recommend screening mammography, although most recommend breast self-examination and perform physical examination of the breast. Physicians are therefore urged to recommend regular screening to their patients.\r"

As co-creators and co-inspirers, behavioral scientists have the rare challenge of synthesizing their perspectives and values with those of the physicians with whom they work.

Simultaneously the mean intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured by means of an epidural device. Arterial carbon-dioxide tensions were monitored by blood gas analysis. In all patients it was observed that the middle cerebral artery flow patterns changed distinctly when the ICP increased; these changes were distinguished by a decrease of the mean flow velocity and an increase of the Pourcelot index. A good correlation between the ICP and the flow parameters (especially the product mean systemic arterial pressure x Pourcelot index/mean flow velocity) was found in a select group of 13 patients, in whom comparable initial conditions existed and in whom additional parameters influencing the TCD recordings could be kept constant (r = 0.873; P less than 0.001).\r"

The first study (10-M-73) began in 1973; 150 patients were treated with melphalan and prednisone (MP) or semustine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (MeCP). In a second randomized study (3-M-77), begun in 1977, 260 patients were treated with MP or melphalan, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, semustine, and vincristine (MPCCV). A total of 27 of the 67 patients (40%) treated with MP and 33 of the 83 patients (40%) treated with MeCP showed a good response in protocol 10-M-73; 48 of 145 patients (33%) treated with MP and 51 of the 115 patients (44%) treated with MPCCV in protocol 3-M-77 obtained a good response (P is not significant). Median survival in protocol 10-M-73 was 30 months for MeCP and 38 months for MP. At 84 months, 19% and 9% remain alive, respectively. Median survival for protocol 3-M-77 was 44 months for those treated with MPCCV and 42 months for MP. At 60 months, 9% and 11% remain alive; this difference was not significant. Also, there was no survival difference for favorable or unfavorable prognostic groups among the four treatment arms of both protocols. It can be concluded, with a long-term follow-up of both protocols, that the combination of MP is as effective as the three- and five-drugs combinations, and in view of its simplicity and cost-saving advantages, it should be favored for initial therapy of multiple myeloma patients.\r"

Patients failing TAM could subsequently receive FLU. The dose of both drugs was 10 mg orally twice daily. Objective responses were seen in 50 of 119 TAM patients (42%) and 63 of 119 TAM plus FLU patients (53%) (one-sided P = .05). Time to disease progression distributions were better for TAM plus FLU (median, 350 days v 199 days), but the log rank test only approached statistical significance (one-sided P = .07). Duration of response and survival distributions were similar between the two treatment arms. Toxicities, in terms of androgenic side effects, were greater on the TAM plus FLU regimen. Fifty-two patients are evaluable for response with FLU following TAM and 21 (40%) have achieved a response. We conclude that the advantages in terms of response rate and time to progression observed with TAM plus FLU probably represent a biological effect, but are not of sufficient magnitude to justify the routine clinical use of this combination given the lack of survival advantage and side effects encountered.\r"

  ".W": "Management of refractory myeloma represents a common and challenging clinical problem. Approximately 30% to 50% of patients with multiple myeloma do not respond to first-line therapy, and those who initially achieve a remission will eventually relapse. Surprisingly, there is no routinely accepted approach to patients with refractory disease. Therefore, we review the literature in an attempt to provide an overview of the published results and outline our treatment recommendations for such patients. We suggest the following: (1) for truly resistant patients (ie, those who clearly progress with initial therapy), administration of high-dose or pulsed glucocorticosteroids is the best treatment, with an expected response of 40% (defined as a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in monoclonal [M]-protein concentration); (2) for patients who relapse during therapy or relapse within 6 months of stopping the initial treatment, the VAD regimen (vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) is one of the most effective salvage therapies, resulting in an approximately 75% response rate (greater than or equal to 50% reduction in M-protein concentration); (3) for patients who relapse within more than 6 months of stopping therapy (unmaintained remission), reinitiation of the initial therapy represents an excellent alternative, leading to recontrol in 60% to 70% of patients (greater than or equal to 50% reduction in M-protein concentration). If progression is observed or if there is response and then relapse in this setting, VAD chemotherapy can be administered again. (4) Patients who fail second-line salvage therapies should enter well-designed clinical trials to evaluate new treatment modalities. If this is not feasible, alpha-interferon or \"systemic\" radiotherapy are recommended in selected cases.\r"

Results from preclinical studies suggest that it has radiosensitizing, chemosensitizing, and differentiating activity. Its mechanism of action remains unknown, but may involve cellular depletion of glutathione, cell membrane changes, or modulation of proto-oncogene expression. Preclinical toxicology studies conducted in mice, rats, and beagle dogs showed reversible hepatotoxicity to be dose-limiting. Clinically, NMF is administered both orally and by intravenous (IV) injection. The bioavailability with oral administration is 90% to 95%. The highest reported plasma concentration of NMF is approximately 4 mmol/L in a patient who received a dose of 2,000 mg/m2 of IV NMF. Biphasic elimination with IV NMF is seen on both the daily for five days and weekly for 3 weeks schedule. Approximately 5% to 7% of the total administered IV dose is excreted in the urine. In phase I studies, dose-limiting toxicities included reversible hepatotoxicity, a generalized malaise syndrome, and nausea and vomiting. One partial response has been reported in the 111 patients treated on phase II trials in colorectal, head and neck, and renal carcinomas. Suggestions for the future development of this drug are presented.\r"

Although the translocation is seen in various histologic subtypes, it is most commonly associated with the follicular lymphomas, especially the small-cleaved cell (FSC) and mixed-cell (FM) subtypes. The translocation breakpoint has been cloned and DNA probes from the junction on chromosome 18 can now be used to detect the genetic consequences of the translocation in tumors with few dividing cells. This will allow a more precise classification of this subset of lymphomas and should lead to better understanding of the biology of this category of lymphomas. Finally, these insights will help in the development of more effective and possibly less toxic therapy.\r"

The fatty acid composition of the dietary fats was made comparable except for the proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids; mold oil contributed gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) at the expense of a portion of the linoleic acid in palm olein. When animals were fed casein rather than soybean protein, serum cholesterol levels were higher irrespective of the fat source, but it took a longer time to produce a significant difference when the dietary fat was mold oil. Soybean protein increased fecal steroid excretion, and mold oil tended to stimulate the excretion of neutral steroids. The ratio of arachidonate to linoleate in phosphatidylcholine from plasma, liver and thoracic aorta was markedly higher in the casein than in the soybean protein groups. Mold oil predictably improved a reduction of arachidonate by vegetable protein. The aortic production of prostacyclin was higher with mold oil than with palm olein irrespective of the protein source, although there was a trend toward a higher production with casein. No protein-fat interaction was observed on the concentration of plasma thromboxane B2. Thus GLA effectively modified metabolic consequences of dietary protein.\r"

Administration of camostat was found to result in a lower weight gain than in untreated rats fed ad libitum because of reduced food intake. The pancreas of treated rats showed hypertrophy and hyperplasia with significantly higher total contents of amylase, lipase, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen than that of pair-fed controls. The specific activity of lipase, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen remained unchanged but the specific activity of amylase was significantly lower than in pair-fed controls. Stimulation of pancreatic enzymes with CCK 8 in treated rats resulted in a greater output of proteases, no difference in secretion of lipase and a lower secretion of amylase than in pair-fed rats. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion was also significantly lower in camostat-treated rats than in controls. This effect could be reversed by gastric inhibitory polypeptide. After termination of treatment with camostat all enzymes were normalized within 14 d. Our results on the hypertrophied pancreas of rats suggest preferential synthesis and secretion of protease at the expense of amylase and diminished sensitivity of insulin to stimulation by glucose. All effects of camostat on the pancreas were reversible.\r"

Incubation of ganglia with AF-DX 116 suppressed the amplitude of the slow-inhibitory postsynaptic potential (s-IPSP) in a concentration-dependent and highly specific manner. At concentrations which reduced the amplitude of the s-IPSP by 80 to 90%, there was no significant reduction of the amplitudes of the muscarinic slow-excitatory postsynaptic potential or the nicotinic fast-excitatory postsynaptic potential. In addition, superfusion of ganglia with AF-DX 116 resulted in the concentration-dependent suppression of ganglionic hyperpolarization induced by methacholine without suppression of methacholine-induced depolarization. Ganglionic hyperpolarization that was produced by norepinephrine was unaffected by AF-DX 116. Increasing the level of acetylcholine available for interaction with muscarinic receptors by increasing the number of stimulus volleys that were applied to the preganglionic nerve resulted in a parallel shift, to the right, of the concentration-response curve for suppression of the s-IPSP by AF-DX 116. Similarly, incubation of ganglia with the specific antiacetylcholinesterase, BW 284 (1-5-bis[4-allyl dimethylammonium phenyl]pentan-3 one dibromide), increased the concentration of AF-DX 116 that was required to produce a comparable suppression of the s-IPSP. These results indicate that the s-IPSP in mammalian superior cervical ganglion involves an action of acetylcholine at the M2 type receptor that is preferentially blocked by AF-DX 116.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported previously that beta-endorphin and morphine administered supraspinally produce analgesia by activating different descending pain inhibitory systems in rats. The descending system activated by beta-endorphin involves a spinal endorphinergic system whereas the descending system activated by morphine does not. To determine if this differential action of intraventricular beta-endorphin and morphine also occurs in mice, the effects of pretreatment with intrathecal (i.t.) and i.c.v. beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA) on analgesic response induced by i.c.v. and i.t. beta-endorphin and morphine were studied in mice. beta-FNA (2.5 micrograms) was injected i.t. or i.c.v. 24 hr before beta-endorphin or morphine administration and hot-plate and tail-flick responses were measured. Intrathecal beta-FNA attenuated i.c.v. beta-endorphin- but not i.c.v. morphine-induced analgesia. On the other hand, i.t. beta-FNA blocked both i.t. beta-endorphin- and morphine-induced analgesia, but was more effective in blocking the effects of i.t. morphine than beta-endorphin. At the supraspinal sites, beta-FNA administered i.c.v. was found to antagonize i.c.v. morphine-induced analgesia but not i.c.v. beta-endorphin-induced analgesia. The present results in mice are consistent with previous studies in rats and indicate that beta-endorphin and morphine activate different supraspinal opioid receptors. Also, analgesia produced by these two opioids resulted from activation of different descending pain inhibitory systems. The spinal endorphinergic system was involved in the production of i.c.v. beta-endorphin-, but not morphine-induced analgesia.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported recently the development of substance P analogs which selectively activate different tachykinin receptor types. These compounds, namely septide [( pGlu6, Pro9]substance P6-11 hexapeptide), which preferentially acts on the NK-1 (SP-P) receptor, and senktide (succinyl-[Asp6,Me-Phe8] substance P (6-11) hexapeptide), which selectively acts on the NK-3 (or SP-N) receptor, were now used to identify the tachykinin receptors present in several smooth muscle systems. Septide as well as senktide were found to be devoid of activity in the electrically stimulated rat vas deferens, showing that, in this preparation, which is the prototype NK-2 (or SP-E) system, tachykinin-induced contraction is not mediated via NK-1 or NK-3 receptors. In contrast, senktide did evoke contraction of the isolated rat duodenum, demonstrating that this tissue, which had been classified previously as a NK-2 preparation, also contains NK-3 receptors. After desensitization of NK-3 receptors by treatment with a desensitizing concentration of senktide, the rank order of tachykinin potencies in contracting the isolated rat duodenum corresponded to that of a typical NK-2 system. In the guinea pig ileum in which the tachykinin-evoked contraction is mediated by both NK-1 and NK-3 receptors, desensitization of NK-3 receptors unmasked a typical NK-1 response. Inasmuch as selective desensitization of both NK-1 and NK-3 sites abolished the tachykinin-induced response of the guinea pig ileum, it seems that this preparation does not contain NK-2 receptors. Our results show that selective agonists can be used to perform independent assays of several tachykinin receptors present within the same tissue preparation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88214929\r", 
  ".W": "Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous herpesvirus, may be asymptomatic or may result in any one of a number of mild to severe hematopoietic disorders. Besides causing infectious mononucleosis, EBV has been associated with 95% of endemic African Burkitt's lymphoma and 10%-20% of the sporadic form of Burkitt's lymphoma outside Africa. EBV has also now been associated with all histological forms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. During the acute phase of infectious mononucleosis, a surprisingly large number of EBV-infected cells can be detected in the peripheral circulation (up to 0.05%). EBV also replicates in epithelial cells in the oropharyngeal region. It is known that physicochemical carcinogens can act synergistically with tumor viruses to enhance both viral replication and cellular transformation. Several laboratories have shown that chemical carcinogens and, in particular, DNA-alkylating agents can enhance EBV replication, EBV-induced lymphocyte transformation, and EBV-associated malignant conversion. Since there are approximately 10(12) lymphocytes in an adult, the large number of EBV-infected cells present in the circulation and oropharynx during infection would present an extraordinarily large target for carcinogen interaction. Moreover, after infection, EBV remains latent in lymphoid cells for life. When these findings are considered in light of analytical and descriptive epidemiological evidence suggesting that, in addition to EBV infection, other environmental cofactors are important in EBV-associated tumor formation, the question could be asked whether these cofactors are physicochemical carcinogens. In an attempt to answer this question, I will review the ways in which physicochemical carcinogens can influence viral replication and virally induced transformation; aspects of the biology of the EBV-lymphocyte-epithelial cell interaction that make this system perhaps unique in terms of possible physicochemical interactions; the epidemiological and experimental evidence supporting EBV-physicochemical carcinogen synergisms; and finally, possible mechanisms whereby chemicals could influence the outcome of EBV infection and the probability of these events occurring during naturally acquired EBV infection.\r"

We found that the clones were heterogeneous for both of these properties. In general, p21 expression was a good predictor of metastatic ability of the clones. Cells from poorly metastatic clones were passaged in the chick embryo metastasis assay to determine whether cells with increased metastatic ability could be selected. We found that the selected cells were more metastatic and that substantial increases in expression of p21 also accompanied this increase in metastatic ability. The relationship between p21 expression and metastatic ability appeared linear, with a high correlation coefficient (r = .85), suggesting that in this model system quantitative increases in metastatic properties can result from increased expression of the ras oncogene protein product p21.\r"

To potentiate the effects of the HAG-isoquinoline drug [HAG-1-isoquinolylmethylene tosylate (HAG-IQ)], we combined it with other inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase. Using mouse leukemia L1210 cell cultures, we tested drug combinations for their cytostatic and cytotoxic properties and for their effects on intracellular ribonucleotide reductase activity and nucleic acid synthesis. Deoxyguanosine or deoxyadenosine combined with HAG-IQ inhibited cell growth in an additive manner; three-drug combinations, HAG-IQ plus either deoxyguanosine/8-aminoguanosine or deoxyadenosine/deoxycoformycin, were strongly synergistic. When Desferal, an iron chelator, was added to these combinations, the four-drug combinations increased inhibition of cell growth and increased cytotoxicity. The intracellular target of these drug combinations in L1210 cells was the ribonucleotide reductase site. The formation of deoxycytidine from [14C]cytidine and incorporation into DNA were markedly inhibited by these drug combinations, while RNA synthesis was unaffected. These data show that the antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of HAG-IQ, a potent inhibitor by itself, can be further potentiated in combinations with other ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors.\r"

The expression of surface antigens on thymic cells before and after injuries was evaluated using the monoclonal antibodies (mcAB) MRC OX4, MRC OX7, MRC OX8, W3/13 HLK, and W3/25 and flow cytometric analysis. Thymic cellularity decreased to less than 1% of normal (N), age-matched rats by 4 days after R or CI. Recovery reached 60% to 70% of N by 28 days post treatments. TI caused a biphasic thymic recovery pattern with nadirs of 40% of N on days 7 and 21. Recovery at day 28 was similar to that after R and CI. Expression of OX7, OX8, W3/13, and W3/25 antigens all reached nadirs of 40% of N by day 4 after R and CI. Recovery of antigen expression, except for W3/25, was near completion by day 7 after R and CI. Changes in antigen expression after TI were less pronounced for all mcAB tested. Decreases in labeling of thymocytes with the helper T-cell marker, W3/25, observed after TI, could not be correlated with elevated expressions of the suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen, OX8. Variations in relative labeling of nonlymphoid thymic cells with OX4 (Ia-antigen) reflected the disappearance and recovery of radiosensitive lymphoid thymocytes. The similarity of results after R and CI demonstrate that the model of CI is 'radiation-dominated.' The addition of burn injury to radiation trauma had no synergistically damaging effect on the parameters studied.\r"

  ".W": "Another study documented that percutaneous transtracheal ventilation with a special 3.5-mm I.D. cannula was possible in experimental complete upper airway obstruction (CAO) using Ambu-assisted ventilation. The effects of ventilation during CAO by occlusion of the endotracheal tube was evaluated by use of a portable oscillatory pressure device (POPD) attached to a 10-g (I.D. 2.4 mm) angiocath catheter inserted through the tracheal wall. Eight pigs were anesthetized and ventilated with the POPD for 15 minutes after CAO with a mean peak airway pressure of 14 cm H2O and continuous positive airway pressure of 5-7 cm H2O, tidal volume below 100 ml, and a rate below 0.5 Hz. A Venturi delivered an FIO2 of 0.68-0.92. All eight showed markedly stable blood gases and cardiovascular parameters (heart rate and systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures). A similar trend was obtained in a separate group of four pigs ventilated with an Ambu bag for 30 minutes; however, the PO2 was lower. In the control group, asphyxia after CAO produced cardiorespiratory failure in every animal in less than 6 minutes. Low-frequency ventilation with a POPD for CAO ensures adequate gas exchange using a standard transtracheal catheter of only 2.4 mm I.D.\r"

  ".W": "Shotguns are popular world wide and more of these weapons exist than the rifled types. With an increasing incidence and prevalence of gunshot wounds it is important for traumatologists to be familiar with shotgun wound ballistics. Shotgun wounds differ from those of other missiles because the spectrum of wound severity is large owing to the fact that the pellets scatter as they travel. Close-range shotgun wounds can be as destructive as those from a high-velocity rifle, but longer weapon-victim ranges may produce only minimal injury. The type of shot (size and weight of pellets) used also determines the type of injury, with more serious injuries produced by the larger type of buckshot (greater than 0.14 inches in diameter). The severity of injury from birdshot depends mainly on the \"effective\" weapon-victim range which can be calculated from the shot size and shot pattern either clinically or from X-ray. Wounds may then be classified according to severity, yielding information on prognosis and extent of investigation and treatment required. We propose a four-level severity scale based upon birdshot pellet scatter patterns which correlate well with morbidity and mortality rates.\r"

This study investigated whether or not ketoconazole could prevent ARDS in critically ill surgical patients. Seventy-one Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) patients without liver dysfunction received either ketoconazole (n = 35), 200 mg daily via the gastrointestinal tract, or placebo (n = 36), for 21 days or until discharge from the SICU, in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Patients were monitored clinically for signs of ARDS, defined as all the following: intrapulmonary shunt greater than 15%, a PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than 150, normal central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge, or left atrial pressure, no other cause of hypoxemia, and a consistent chest X-ray. Thirteen patients (18%) developed ARDS with significantly increased mortality versus non-ARDS patients (69% vs. 29%). The incidence of ARDS was decreased among ketoconazole patients compared to placebo (6% vs. 31%; p less than 0.01), as was median SICU stay (7.0 days vs. 15.5 days; p less than 0.05), and median SICU cost (+5,600. vs. +12,400.; p less than 0.05). Mortality is increased with ARDS after trauma and surgery. We conclude that ketoconazole prevents ARDS, shortens SICU stay, and lowers hospital costs.\r"

Despite aggressive physical therapy aimed at prevention, heterotopic bone formation still occurs in a small percentage of patients. Prolonged immobilization in concert with trauma or burn about the involved joint is recognized as being responsible for this heterotopic bone formation. Specifically, immobilization of extremities, particularly the elbow and upper extremity, should be minimized by early grafting for preservation of function. As burn therapy has enabled increasing numbers of patients to survive extensive burns, it is imperative that preservation of function not be ignored and that attention be directed at improved function early in the postburn course.\r"

Intraoperative duplex imaging (10 MHz B-mode ultrasound combined with 7.5 MHz Doppler spectrum analysis) was used in an attempt to recognize technical problems that might result in serious neurologic injury. Eighty-four carotid arteries were studied in 76 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy or reconstruction. Indications for operation included carotid territory transient ischemic attack (n = 36 [43%]), amaurosis fugax (n = 16 [19%]), stroke (n = 11 [13%]), asymptomatic stenosis (n = 11 [13%]), vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attack (n = 7 [8%]), recurrent stenosis (n = 2 [2%]), and trauma (n = 1 [1%]). Arterial anatomy was assessed ultrasonographically and duplex-derived velocity measurements were obtained to assess hemodynamics. Increased velocity measurement was noted to correlate with ultrasound image of stenosis. Technical errors were identified in 17 patients (22%), including six persons with residual internal carotid artery stenoses, three persons with hemodynamically significant stenoses caused by \"kinked\" internal carotid arteries, eight persons with debris or intimal flaps in their external carotid arteries, and one person with an occluded external carotid artery. The intraoperative duplex scan led to corrective measures during the surgical procedure in eight patients (11%). No new ipsilateral brain injury was noted in the 76 patients postoperatively. Intraoperative duplex scanning accurately identified residual stenosis, intraluminal thrombus, and loose debris. Duplex scanning altered intraoperative decision making in a significant proportion of patients studied.\r"

UI was compared with ascending contrast phlebography in 46 limbs and was found to be 100% accurate in detecting both acute and chronic venous thrombosis. Overall, acute DVT was present in 63 of 76 limbs (83%) studied. Acute DVT was found in 24% and recurrent acute DVT in 76%. Our results indicate that although the calf veins are the most common site of involvement (89%), thrombi may frequently arise simultaneously in multiple anatomic sites. All limbs with recurrent acute DVT had evidence of previous calf thrombi but only 13% had previous proximal disease. This suggests that asymptomatic calf DVT is common and the prevalence of recurrent acute DVT is significantly greater than previously believed. We found UI is a practical, accurate, non-invasive method for investigating the pathogenesis of venous disease.\r"

Elective repair was performed in 26 limbs and the remaining 22 limbs required urgent or emergent treatment after aneurysm thrombosis (16) or embolic digital ischemia (six). Retrospective review of preoperative and intraoperative arteriograms and CT or ultrasound scans was done to define the relationship of distal runoff anatomy to initial symptoms and long-term grafting success during a mean follow-up of 48 months. Only five of 48 limbs (10%) had three continuous tibial vessels and a patent pedal arch. Twenty-six limbs (55%) had one or no named calf vessels and 11 limbs had incomplete pedal arches. When thrombosis or symptomatic embolism occurred, the anatomy was significantly worse; 15 of 22 such limbs (68%) had one or no patent tibial vessels and seven had incomplete pedal arches. Nineteen of 28 aneurysms examined by CT or ultrasound scanning showed intraluminal thrombus. Eight of 13 patent aneurysms with intraluminal thrombus had one or no patent tibial vessels. The 5-year graft patency rate was 74% for the entire study group. Bypass for repair of asymptomatic aneurysms had a patency rate of 91% at 5 years vs 54% for symptomatic patients (p less than 0.05). Patients with popliteal aneurysms often have advanced tibial disease that appears worse in those with symptoms. The occurrence of a patent popliteal aneurysm with intraluminal thrombus and advanced runoff disease suggests that chronic microembolism may be an etiologic factor in the tibial disease observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The prevalence of hearing impairment in this sample was 30%. The audioscope yielded reproducible results in the physicians' offices and a hearing center. The sensitivity of the audioscope was 94% in both locations, while its specificity was 90% in the hearing center and 72% in the physicians' offices. The HHIE-S yielded reproducible results between the two test locations. An HHIE-S score from 0 to 8 resulted in a likelihood ratio of 0.36 (95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.68), and a score of 26 or more yielded a likelihood ratio of 12.00 (95% confidence interval, 2.62 to 55.00) for predicting the presence of hearing impairment. Used together, the two instruments had a test accuracy of 83%. The audioscope and HHIE-S are valid, reliable, inexpensive tools for detecting hearing impairment in the elderly.\r"

Doppler determination of fetal heart rate during vigorous maternal effort is difficult. To avoid motion artifact, we observed fetal heart rate using two-dimensional ultrasound and determined the incidence of fetal bradycardia in 45 pregnant women (age, 29.0 +/- 3.7 years [mean +/- SD]; gestational age, 25.2 +/- 3.0 weeks) during 85 submaximal and 79 maximal cycle ergometer tests. Average fetal heart rate did not change during exercise. A single episode of fetal bradycardia (heart rate less than 110 beats per minute for greater than or equal to 10 s) occurred during submaximal exertion during a maternal vasovagal episode. Sixteen episodes of fetal bradycardia were noted within three minutes after cessation of exercise, 15 of which followed maximal maternal effort. We conclude that brief submaximal maternal exercise up to approximately 70% of maximal aerobic power (maternal heart rate less than or equal to 148 beats per minute) does not affect fetal heart rate. In contrast to submaximal maternal exertion, maximal exertion is commonly followed by fetal bradycardia. This may indicate inadequate fetal gas exchange.\r"

Ivermectin was administered once orally at four dose levels (range, 25 to 200 micrograms/kg), and at each it was found to be completely effective in clearing blood microfilariae within five to 12 days. In most patients, microfilariae reappeared by three months; by six months the levels averaged 14% to 32% of pretreatment values in the four study groups, and all groups showed equivalent efficacy. Detailed monitoring identified some side effects in almost all patients: usually fever, headache, light-headedness, myalgia, sore throat, or cough that occurred most prominently 18 to 36 hours after treatment. These were most frequent and severe in patients with the greatest microfilaremia, but only when treated with the two higher doses of ivermectin (100 and 200 micrograms/kg). The low-dose (25 micrograms/kg) ivermectin group, despite equivalent efficacy in parasite killing, had clinical reaction scores that were minimal and that were not correlated with parasitemia. Since efficacy and side effects of ivermectin therapy compare favorably with those reported for treatment with the standard antifilarial drug diethylcarbamazine citrate, the major advantage of single-oral-dose administration makes ivermectin the best candidate to replace diethylcarbamazine as the treatment of choice for bancroftian filariasis.\r"

This immunotoxin was used to treat a patient with severe grade III-IV, steroid-resistant, acute graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) after an allogeneic, human leukocyte antigen-identical bone marrow transplant for acute myelogenous leukemia. Immunotoxin therapy produced a complete clinical response in the skin and gastrointestinal tract. The patient tolerated a 14-day course without symptoms or signs of toxic effects. After two days of therapy, circulating T cells could not be demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. After therapy, acute GvHD did not recur. However, seven months after therapy the patient demonstrated mild signs of chronic GvHD that were easily controlled with low-dose immunosuppressive therapy. These findings indicate that an anti-T-cell ricin A chain immunotoxin can be given safely for treatment of acute GvHD and may be an effective therapy for this significant posttransplant complication.\r"

Differences in interpretation of these trials are a source of major disputes about the proper threshold for medical intervention. The ethical aspects of treatment decisions are then reviewed, with particular emphasis on the doctrine of informed consent and on the role of patient participation in treatment decisions. Finally, new directions for clinical research are suggested that may yield a more complete scientific basis for treatment decisions and that may aid in fulfilling the ethical ideals that underlie the physician-patient relationship.\r"

  ".W": "This study describes the development of an experimental model of reversible acute renal failure following infusion of contrast media radiographic dye. Experiments were also performed to investigate possible methods of prevention as well as examine single nephron mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the renal failure. Acute renal failure was consistently produced by indomethacin treatment (18 mg/kg) and an intravenous infusion of contrast media (7 ml/kg) into New Zealand rabbits that had been on a low sodium diet for one week. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), measured by daily creatinine clearance in unanesthetized animals, was significantly decreased (P less than 0.001) 24, 48, and 72 hours following infusion of the contrast dye. Two weeks after induction of acute renal failure, GFR had returned to control. GFR was unchanged during the same time period when the sodium deprived rabbits were given either indomethacin or contrast media alone. Chronic administration of DOCA (1 mg/kg s.c.) and saline drinking water which increased sodium and solute excretions and decreased plasma renin activity also prevented the decrease in GFR. However, acute infusion of either saline or mannitol, which transiently increased sodium and solute excretions and decreased plasma renin activity, did not protect against the development of acute renal failure. Light microscopy revealed no glomerular or tubular changes and no visible obstruction. Micropuncture experiments were performed on three additional groups of anesthetized rabbits: control, acute renal failure, and recovery. Recovery rabbits were allowed a two week period after renal failure before they were micropunctured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The bacteria did not stain with the Brown-Brenn, acid-fast, or other histochemical stains for infectious organisms, but did stain with Warthin-Starry--ie, the staining profile was that described for the cat scratch disease (CSD) bacillus. Immunoperoxidase staining, using antisera raised in rabbits against cultured CSD bacillus, showed a positive reaction with the bacterium in all five cases tested. The two surviving patients have both given histories of having been scratched by a cat. In several patients, the vascular lesions regressed after therapy with antibiotics appropriate for CSD bacillus infection.\r"

In further trials the E-Z vaccine was compared with the Schwarz vaccine, both being given in subcutaneous doses of 40,000 plaque forming units. In infants aged 20 weeks the E-Z vaccine produced higher levels of measles antibody and in those aged 18 weeks its superiority showed in a lower proportion failing to respond (3 of 39 versus 19 of 35).\r"

After six months group I showed a rise in haemoglobin to 9.1 (SD 2.5) g/dl and a decrease in blood transfusion requirements, both significant, whereas group II showed no changes. Other significant changes observed in group I, but not group II, were a rise in reticulocytes and in red cell creatine and a fall in red cell protoporphyrin and serum ferritin. Ferritin decreased more in the patients whose anaemia improved. Minor increases in serum aluminium in group I did not differ from those in the control group. Desferrioxamine may benefit the anaemia of chronic haemodialysis patients through improvement of erythropoiesis. The effect seems not to be related to chelation of a heavy aluminium overload.\r"

There was a striking relation between the presence of drugs in the urine and swallowing of drug-filled bundles (cocaine 49 of 50 cases, heroin 9 of 10). The proportion of positive results was also high in cases of rectal insertion (cocaine 2 of 2, heroin 35 of 58). In 30 cases of cocaine-packet ingestion, serial measurements showed that the accuracy of the test progressively decreased with respect to the detection of residual packets in the body. Drug detection in the urine of suspected body-packers seems to be a useful test, positive results justifying subsequent radiological investigations.\r"

In the first phase patients were given GM-CSF alone. In phase II, which started a week after completion of phase I, patients received a course of cytotoxic chemotherapy, then a course of GM-CSF. Phase III consisted only of cytotoxic chemotherapy. GM-CSF (phase I) alone produced an 18-fold increase in peripheral blood granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) and an 8-fold increase in erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) in the peripheral blood. GM-CSF had no effect on bone-marrow CFU-GM and BFU-E in the group as a whole. Three patients were investigated after phases II and III. GM-CSF increased the absolute number of peripheral blood CFU-GM by approximately 60-fold compared with the pretreatment baseline. These effects of GM-CSF may be of clinical importance with regard to facilitating the harvest of peripheral blood progenitor cells for autotransplantation.\r"

  ".W": "In 70 paired insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) and short 'Synacthen' tests (SSTs), both of which have been advocated for assessment of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, there were 51 passes on both tests, 9 failures on both, and 10 discrepant results (9 failures on the SST, 1 failure on the ITT). There was a close correlation between the maximum cortisol value achieved in the two tests. A survey of British endocrinologists showed that only 24% used the SST to assess the HPA axis. It is suggested that the SST should be used for the initial assessment of the HPA axis and the ITT reserved for patients who fail the SST, those on corticosteroid therapy, and those who have had an acute pituitary insult within 14 days.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve trained males, in a fed state, were studied to examine the effect of pre-exercise fructose ingestion on endurance capacity during prolonged cycling exercise. Sixty minutes prior to exercise, subjects ingested either 60 or 85 g fructose or a sweet placebo. Mean exercise intensity initially required 62% of the maximal aerobic power and thereafter increased to elicit 72 and 81% of maximal aerobic power at 90 and 120 min of exercise, respectively. Exercise time (mean +/- SE) to exhaustion was significantly increased after fructose ingestion, as compared to placebo ingestion (145 +/- 4 vs 132 +/- 3 min, P less than 0.01). During the exercise, no differences were observed between both trials for oxygen uptake, heart rate, or perceived exertion. Serum glucose and insulin levels between both trials were not significantly different throughout the experiment. There were also no significant differences in serum-free fatty acids and glycerol levels as well as respiratory exchange ratio between fructose and placebo trials during the exercise. The results suggest that fructose ingestion is of benefit before prolonged exercise, because it provides a carbohydrate source to contracting muscles without transient hypoglycemia and a depression of fat utilization, and thereby delays the fatigue.\r"

Lipoprotein-lipid profiles, plasma glucose and insulin responses during an oral glucose tolerance test, and blood pressure at rest were determined before and after training. The training program resulted in a 13% increase in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (39 +/- 2 vs 44 +/- 3 mg.dl-1, P less than 0.05), a 43% increase in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (7 +/- 2 vs 10 +/- 2 mg.dl-1, P less than 0.05), a 5% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (129 +/- 5 vs 122 +/- 5 mg.dl-1, P less than 0.05), and an 8% decrease in the total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio (5.1 +/- 0.3 vs 4.7 +/- 0.3, P less than 0.01), despite no changes in VO2max, body weight, or percent body fat. Glucose-stimulated plasma insulin concentrations during oral glucose tolerance testing were significantly lower, and supine diastolic blood pressure was reduced (P less than 0.05) as a result of the training program. No changes in any of these variables occurred in a sedentary control group. These findings indicate that resistive training can lower risk factors for coronary artery disease independent of changes in VO2max, body weight, or body composition.\r"

Most patients present with subacute respiratory and constitutional symptoms and have failed to respond to therapy for presumptive pneumonia. A previous history of atopy, most often asthma, will be obtained in one-half. Eosinophilia occurs in most cases and its absence may be the major indication for lung biopsy. Although pulmonary infiltrates are more often peripheral than not, the classic \"photographic negative of pulmonary edema\" is seen in less than one-third of cases. Pathologic findings include an intra-alveolar and interstitial infiltrate which comprises eosinophils, histiocytes, and exudate. Bronchiolitis obliterans and eosinophilic microabscesses occur less frequently. Open-lung biopsy is preferable when atypical features prevent a confident clinical diagnosis. The exquisite responsiveness of CEP to corticosteroids should encourage use of a therapeutic trial when there is a strong clinical suspicion of the disorder. The rapid clinical response should not deter the clinician from giving a prolonged course of treatment. The differential diagnosis includes other diseases characterized by PIE and the more recently recognized bronchiolitis obliterans and organizing pneumonia, a disorder which is also marked by peripheral pulmonary infiltrates.\r"

Thus, only a quarter of patients who ultimately may have benefited from bone marrow transplantation are currently eligible. Even in matched patient recipient pairs, GVHD accounts for approximately 40% of the deaths following allogeneic bone marrow transplants. One of the major challenges for transplantation is to derive better strategies to prevent and treat GVHD while retaining the allogeneic benefit of graft-versus-leukemia. Current pharmacologic approaches have used cyclosporine, usually in combination with other drugs. More experimental approaches have removed lymphocytes from the marrow grafts. With either approach, maintaining the anti-leukemic benefit of an allogeneic transplant (i.e., immunologic attack of the leukemia resulting in a lower relapse rate), will need to be maintained if that approach will ultimately prove to be useful.\r"

Risk factors for IP overall were acute graft-versus-host disease (AGVHD), remote transplant date, the diagnosis of leukemia, and GVHD prophylaxis with agents other than cyclosporine. Risk factors for CMV IP were pre-transplant CMV seropositivity, CMV excretion, age greater than 10 years, AGVHD, GVHD prophylaxis with agents other than cyclosporine, and a remote transplant date. Patients transplanted for aplastic anemia were at lower risk for idiopathic IP than those transplanted for leukemia. The incidence of IP in patients given busulfan plus cyclophosphamide was equivalent to that in patients receiving cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation. The incidence of idiopathic IP remained constant over this 9-year period while CMV IP declined significantly.\r"

We sought to determine the relation between the clinical phenotype and the status of dystrophin in muscle-biopsy specimens from 103 patients with various neuromuscular disorders. We found very low levels (less than 3 percent of normal levels) or no dystrophin in the severe Duchenne phenotype (35 of 38 patients), low concentrations of dystrophin in the intermediate (outlier) phenotype (4 of 7), and dystrophin of abnormal molecular weight in the mild Becker phenotype (12 of 18). Normal levels of dystrophin of normal molecular weight were found in nearly all the patients (38 of 40) with 20 other neuromuscular disorders we studied. These data show the clinical consequences of both quantitative alterations (in Duchenne's and intermediate dystrophy) in a single protein. The biochemical assay for dystrophin should prove helpful in delineating myopathies that overlap clinically with Duchenne's and Becker's dystrophies, and it shows promise as an accurate diagnostic tool.\r"

Twenty-seven patients with transitional-cell carcinoma of the urothelium who were undergoing treatment with methotrexate, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and cisplatin were given rhG-CSF (up to 60 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day) before their first cycle of combination chemotherapy, during the first cycle, or at both points. Treatment with rhG-CSF before chemotherapy resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the absolute neutrophil count. Treatment with rhG-CSF after chemotherapy significantly reduced the number of days (91 percent) per patient on which the absolute neutrophil count was 1000 per microliter or less (P = 0.0039), reduced the number of days (1 vs. 35) on which antibiotics were used to treat fever and neutropenia, and significantly increased the percentage (100 vs. 29 percent) of patients qualified to receive planned chemotherapy on day 14 of the treatment cycle (P = 0.0015). In addition, the incidence of mucositis was significantly decreased (11 vs. 44 percent, P = 0.041), as was its severity. These findings demonstrate that rhG-CSF is a potent stimulus of normal neutrophil proliferation and maturation. In addition, its administration can reduce both the hematopoietic and oral toxicity of chemotherapy.\r"

Symptoms of hypoglycemia and counterregulatory neuroendocrine responses were quantified during hypoglycemic and euglycemic clamp studies in eight patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus selected because their hemoglobin A1 levels were above 10 percent. These data were compared with similar observations in 10 nondiabetic subjects studied previously. Glycemic thresholds--the plasma glucose concentrations during each hypoglycemic clamp study at which a given symptom or biochemical measurement first exceeded its 95 percent confidence interval determined in the euglycemic clamp studies--were calculated for each variable. The mean (+/- SE) glycemic threshold for the symptoms of hypoglycemia was 4.3 +/- 0.3 mmol per liter (78 +/- 5 mg per deciliter) in patients with poorly controlled diabetes--significantly higher (P less than 0.001) than the value of 2.9 +/- 0.1 mmol per liter (53 +/- 2 mg per deciliter) in subjects without diabetes. The mean glycemic thresholds for growth hormone, epinephrine, and cortisol secretions were not significantly different in the two groups. Thus, during decreases in the plasma glucose concentration, patients with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus may experience symptoms of hypoglycemia at higher plasma glucose concentrations than persons without diabetes. The mechanism underlying this observation remains to be defined.\r"

Patients assigned to long-term cyclosporine (n = 138) or short-term cyclosporine followed by azathioprine and prednisolone (n = 141) had similar actuarial 12-month survival (98.4 vs. 96.4 percent) and graft survival (83.9 vs. 82.1 percent). Patients assigned to receive only azathioprine and prednisolone (n = 138), with optional use of antithymocyte globulin, had a significantly poorer survival rate (91.3 percent, P = 0.015) because of deaths from cardiac causes and infection, but their graft survival of 76.0 percent (P = 0.31) did not differ significantly from that of either group receiving cyclosporine. After the switch from cyclosporine to azathioprine and prednisolone, 15 percent of patients had reversible rejection episodes, but the frequency of rejection and graft loss did not differ from that in the long-term cyclosporine group. After the change to azathioprine and prednisolone, serum creatinine levels declined in nearly all patients, so that after three months they were comparable to those in the group receiving azathioprine and prednisolone only, and significantly lower than those in the group receiving long-term cyclosporine therapy (P less than 0.003). We conclude that the two cyclosporine regimens result in comparable patient and graft survival, but that changing to azathioprine and prednisolone at three months improves graft function.\r"

  ".W": "Within the substantia nigra, the dendrites of dopaminergic neurons that project to the striatum appear to play an active and nonclassical role in the physiology of the neuron in that they release transmitter and protein, but little is known of the factors controlling release of substances from these dendrites. In this study, we show that 5-hydroxytryptamine, which is contained in afferent fibres to the substantia nigra, is present in terminals making direct synaptic contact with dopaminergic neurons and also that it has a site-dependent, receptor-mediated, facilitatory effect on a specific dendritic calcium-dependent potential in nigrostriatal neurons in vitro. The ionic and spatial features of this response, which is insensitive to blockade by three different K+-channel antagonists, could correspond to those underlying the dendritic release of dopamine.\r"

  ".W": "At least three different glucose transport systems exist in mammalian cells. These are: (1) the constitutively active, facilitative carrier characteristic of human erythrocytes, Hep G2 (ref. 2) cells and rat brain; (2) the Na-dependent active transporter of kidney and small intestine; and (3) the facilitative carrier of rat liver (B. Thorens and H. F. Lodish, personal communication). A fourth possible glucose transport system is the insulin-dependent carrier that may be specific to muscle and adipose tissue. This transporter resides primarily in an intracellular compartment in resting cells from where it translocates to the cell surface upon cellular insulin exposure. This raises the question of whether hormonal regulation of glucose transport is conferred by virtue of a tissue-specific signalling mechanism or a tissue-specific glucose transporter. Here we present data supporting the latter concept based upon a monoclonal antibody against the fat cell glucose transporter that identifies a unique, insulin-regulatable glucose transport protein in muscle and adipose tissue.\r"

Although phosphoinositide turnover in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to be regulated by glucose and sterol, as yet no definitive function has been ascribed to yeast phosphoinositides. We have recently developed a monoclonal antibody specific for PIP2 and reported that it inhibits mitogenesis of mammalian cells stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor and bombesin. We now report that when introduced into yeast cells by electroporation this antibody inhibits their growth. Furthermore, several yeast mutants with temperature-dependent growth defects are altered in their sensitivity to our antibody and are found to have specific alterations in their phosphoinositide metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "88216820\r", 
  ".W": "The tight junction (Zonula occludens), a belt-like region of contact between cells of polarized epithelia, serves as a selective barrier to small molecules and as a total barrier to large molecules, and is involved in the separation between lumenal and basolateral compartments of the epithelium. In the electron microscope, tight junctions show focal regions of apparent fusion between the adjoining cell membranes, and freeze-fractured membranes display an elaborate network of branching and anastomosing strands. Very little is known about the molecular composition and architecture of tight junctions. The first specific zonula occludens-associated protein, designated ZO-1, has recently been identified in mammalian epithelial and endothelial cells. Here we describe the identification and purification of a new component of this junctional complex in avian brush-border cells, which we name cingulin. Cingulin is an acidic, heat-stable protein, with a highly elongated shape. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy of brush-border cells with anti-cingulin antibodies show that cingulin is localized in the apical zone of the terminal web, at the endofacial surfaces of the zonula occludens.\r"

Sixty-four patients had amaurosis fugax (AF), 17 central retinal artery occlusions (CRAO), and 21 branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO). The prevalence of carotid stenosis (greater than or equal to 60%) ipsilateral to the symptomatic eye was low (16%). Eighty-six percent of AF patients had either no plaque causing less than a 60% stenosis. A significant proportion of subjects with normal duplex scans had alternative explanations for their retinal ischemia (eg, migraine, cardiac embolus). Patients with Hollenhorst plaques were more likely to have stenotic or ulcerated plaque (p = 0.04). The degree of carotid stenosis correlated significantly with the number of vascular risk factors identified in individual patients (p = 0.02). The presence of risk factors was more common in CRAO and BRAO patients compared with the AF group. Combined ultrasound-Doppler investigations of the carotid bifurcation are valuable noninvasive tools for the screening of patients with retinal ischemia.\r"

We identified two groups of patients: those in whom upright mean arterial pressure significantly increased (group I, n = 3) and those in whom upright mean arterial pressure decreased (group II, n = 4) during midodrine treatment. Body weight changed in a parallel manner with upright blood pressure, increasing in patients of group I and decreasing in patients of group II (p less than 0.05). Autonomic cardiovascular reflexes were significantly more impaired in patients of group II than in patients of group I. We conclude that midodrine is effective in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension only in those patients with significant preservation of autonomic reflexes. Conversely, in patients with markedly impaired baroreceptor mechanisms, treatment with midodrine may produce extracellular fluid volume depletion and exacerbate orthostatic hypotension.\r"

Twenty of these 86 women (23.3%) also had unstable detrusors preoperatively. Eleven of these 20 women (55%) had stable detrusors after retropubic urethropexy. Five of the 66 patients (7.6%) who had stable detrusors preoperatively were found to have unstable detrusors on postoperative urethrocystometry. The overall cure rate for women with detrusor instability and genuine stress incontinence was only 30%. Analysis of symptoms, previous anti-incontinence procedures, age, parity, and cystometric parameters revealed no differences between those women who had stable detrusors after retropubic urethropexy and those who remained unstable. Similarly, patients whose bladders became unstable after retropubic urethropexy could not be distinguished from those who remained stable. Patients undergoing retropubic urethropexy should understand the possibility that the operation may cause urinary incontinence due to detrusor instability even if it cures their genuine stress incontinence, and that if they have both genuine stress incontinence and detrusor instability, their chances for an operative cure of both conditions are low.\r"

Ascitic fluid or peritoneal washings were obtained during 96 reassessment laparotomies that were biopsy-positive for residual intraperitoneal ovarian cancer. Cytologic studies done on these samples failed to detect malignant cells in 66% of the cases with gross residual disease and 78% of the cases with only microscopic residual disease on biopsy. The accuracy of peritoneal cytology in detecting residual ovarian cancer was unrelated to residual tumor size, original clinical stage, histologic tumor grade, and tumor cell type. Examination of ascitic fluid found at the time of surgery was somewhat more reliable than assessment of peritoneal washings, although this difference was of borderline statistical significance. Peritoneal cytology cannot reliably detect residual ovarian cancer after initial treatment with surgery and chemotherapy. Negative peritoneal cytology is frequently seen in the presence of gross residual tumor.\r"

Five of the eight patients detected their own tumors. Two requested abortion, but prophylactic abortion did not appear to improve outcome in the one patient with advanced disease. Seven of eight patients were between 35-40 years of age. Although based on limited experience, a plan for managing breast cancer during pregnancy is suggested. It appears that a more favorable prognosis for cure and longer periods of remission can be achieved with better breast examinations, responsible screening techniques, early diagnosis, and prompt therapy.\r"

All infants were delivered by cesarean section.

In the asymptomatic patient, surgery should be performed promptly on an elective basis in the first and second trimesters. During the third trimester, an asymptomatic defect should be repaired at the time of elective cesarean section. Active labor should be avoided. If symptoms of obstruction arise, this lesion represents a true surgical emergency, and immediate operative intervention should be undertaken regardless of the stage of pregnancy. Delay can result in both fetal and maternal mortality in up to half of cases.

A clean-catch midstream urine specimen was obtained from 750 consecutive obstetric patients presenting for initial evaluation. One portion of the specimen was tested for nitrites and leukocyte esterase activity with Chemstrip LN dipsticks. A second aliquot of urine was plated on blood and MacConkey agar and incubated aerobically. The cost of the nitrite and leukocyte esterase test was $0.35. The per patient charge for the urine cultures would have been $28. Sixty-two women (8.3%) had urine cultures of 100,000 or more colony-forming units of a uropathogen per milliliter. The sensitivities of the nitrite and leukocyte esterase test in identifying patients with positive cultures were 43 and 77%, respectively, and the specificities were 99 and 96%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for the two tests combined (either test abnormal) were 92 and 95%, respectively. Five patients had negative screening tests but positive urine cultures; all five isolates were gram-positive organisms, three group B streptococci and two enterococci. We conclude that neither the nitrite test nor the leukocyte esterase test alone is a sensitive enough screening test to detect asymptomatic bacteriuria in obstetric patients. The combination of the two tests, however, may provide an acceptable cost-effective alternative to screening all asymptomatic obstetric patients with urine cultures.\r"

With a lapse time mean of 16 +/- 11 days and a range of zero to 35 days, the generated equation accurately predicted birth weight (R2 = 0.84; P less than or equal to .0001). For all birth weights, the mean error was -15 +/- 306 g, the percent mean error was 0.51 +/- 10.2%, and the mean absolute error of the estimate was 82 g/kg birth weight. This accuracy was maintained across the full range of lapse time observed. For examinations performed within one week of delivery (N = 71), this formula more accurately predicted birth weight than five existing static formulas tested. The accuracy observed during model development was confirmed during testing upon 167 non-model cases. The accurate prediction of birth weight from remote ultrasound data is possible when lapse time is included in the predicting equation. The clinical value of this model is suggested when ultrasound is unavailable or unreliable.\r"

  ".W": "The dramatic reduction in perinatal morbidity and mortality over the last decade has not been accompanied by any diminution in the incidence of cerebral palsy. We investigated retrospectively the relationship of certain perinatal events to the subsequent development of cerebral palsy in 75 infants. Cerebral palsy occurred in association with acute intrapartum asphyxia in 8% and traumatic delivery in 11%. Thirty-five percent of cases were associated with chronic fetal distress, defined by a unique fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern consisting of a normal baseline rate with persistently absent variability and mild variable decelerations with overshoot. This pattern was found frequently in association with postmaturity, meconium staining, intrauterine growth retardation, and neonatal seizures. Acid-base studies, when available, did not reveal acidosis. Twenty-seven percent of the cases involved a combination of chronic fetal distress, acute intrapartum fetal asphyxia, and/or traumatic delivery. We postulate that antenatal intermittent umbilical cord compression secondary to oligohydramnios results in repetitive transient central nervous system ischemia, insufficient to cause death, but resulting in a characteristic FHR pattern and impaired neurologic development. If these data are confirmed, this FHR pattern may be an important marker for the development of subsequent neurologic handicap or other adverse outcome.\r"

The MSAFP distributions for the two conditions were both log-Gaussian, and the log standard deviation was smaller for gastroschisis than for omphalocele. The MSAFP screening sensitivity was greater for gastroschisis than for omphalocele at any given cutoff, and the overall sensitivity of this screening process for detecting open ventral wall defects will differ, therefore, depending upon the relative proportion of gastroschisis and omphalocele cases that occur in the screened population.\r"

Sixteen cases of gastroschisis were identified antepartum and followed through delivery between 1980-1986. There was one antepartum fetal death before institution of a protocol to deliver all such affected fetuses at 36 weeks. One patient was lost to follow-up. There were no antenatal or neonatal deaths among the 14 infants seen subsequently, all of whom were delivered by cesarean section. Only one infant had an additional nongastrointestinal defect (mild hearing loss), and all 14 were of appropriate weight for gestational age. Twelve infants had a single operative procedure for repair of the defect, with a mean hospital stay of 19.6 days. Scheduled cesarean delivery at 36 weeks, after confirmation of fetal lung maturity, presents the infant to the pediatric surgeon under controlled conditions and shortens neonatal hospital stay.\r"

Two groups of smokers, consuming five to 15 cigarettes per day or one or more packs per day, also had significant differences in grade III placenta when compared with nonsmokers. Smokers under age 20 years were more likely to have premature grade III changes; however, parity did not influence premature placental calcification in smokers and nonsmokers. The incidence of small for gestational age infants delivered was not significantly higher in smokers, and grade III placental changes appeared to occur no more often in SGA infants of smokers than of nonsmokers. Our findings suggest that the smoking gravida is at increased risk for premature placental calcification.\r"

In the face of growing public awareness, it is essential that clinicians develop a knowledgeable and effective approach to patient concerns about reproductive hazards in the workplace. Of vital importance is the accurate characterization of exposure at the worksite. Intervention strategies for worrisome situations include amelioration of worksite exposure or, as a last resort, temporary, compensated job modification or transfer. The clinician can obtain assistance in addressing the problem from several resources, including local regulatory agencies and occupational health clinics. Widespread involvement of knowledgeable health professionals can have a dramatic impact on improving this important contemporary public health problem.\r"

  ".W": "Sonographic measurement of cervical length during pregnancy can provide an objective, noninvasive assessment of anatomical shortening associated with premature labor and delivery. One hundred fifty normal women underwent serial sonographic cervical length measurements during uncomplicated pregnancy. The mean cervical length was 52 +/- 12 mm until 34 weeks' gestation, when gradual effacement and cervical length shortening began. Using these data, we managed 88 pregnant women with previous second-trimester pregnancy losses by a combination of cerclage placement for cervical length less than 40 mm and aggressive therapy for premature uterine contractions. The results showed the following: 1) 97% of women with diethylstilbestrol exposure and 80% of women with mullerian abnormalities exhibited cervical length shortening; 2) only 60% of women with a normal uterine cavity showed cervical lengths of less than 40 mm; and 3) all three groups of high-risk patients, independent of cervical length, showed significant premature uterine activity. These observations suggest that sonographic cervical length measurement may be a useful adjunct in the assessment of anatomical cervical integrity and the decision for cerclage placement. Furthermore, the presence of both premature cervical length shortening and preterm uterine activity in 65% of high-risk patients suggests that \"cervical incompetence\" and premature labor may not be distinct entities, but common symptoms associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery.\r"

Because symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea are not part of the infant colic syndrome, infants with these gastrointestinal symptoms were excluded from the study. Dietary changes were accomplished by either feeding the infants a hydrolyzed casein formula or by requiring mothers to eliminate milk from their diets. In phase 1 of the study, the group receiving counseling (n = 10) had a decrease in crying from 3.21 +/- 1.10 h/d to 1.08 +/- 0.70 h/d (P = .001). The crying in the group that received dietary changes (n = 10) decreased from 3.19 +/- 0.69 h/d to 2.03 +/- 1.07 h/d (P = .01), a level still greater than twice normal. The decrease in those receiving counseling was faster and greater than that of those given dietary changes (P less than .02). In the second phase of the study, group 2 infants were reexposed to cow's milk or soy protein and the parents received counseling. In this phase, counseling again decreased crying significantly from 2.09 +/- 1.07 h/d to 1.19 +/- 0.60 h/d (P = .05). No infant in the study who improved with changes in his or her diet had a significant increase in crying, with reexposure to soy or cow's milk protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A very low birth weight infant, infected with Candida, was first seen with hypertension, renal insufficiency, and urine cultures positive for fungus; obstructive bladder fungus ball was diagnosed by ultrasonography. Mechanical disruption with amphotericin B bladder irrigation was accomplished via ultrasonographic guidance, relieving renal obstruction and insufficiency. Systemic antifungal therapy was completed with amphotericin B and flucytosine. The first reported case of bladder obstructive fungal uropathy in a neonate is added to a review of 16 cases of neonatal renal obstructive uropathy.\r"

To understand better the cardiopulmonary interaction in patients with acute respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis, we performed M-mode echocardiograms and pulsed Doppler assessment of pulmonary arterial flow in 19 patients with structurally normal hearts during acute illness. Studies were repeated in 11 of these patients following complete recovery. Based on severity of respiratory compromise, patients were grouped into those with severe illness (ten patients) or mild illness (nine patients). Left ventricular dimensions and shortening fraction were used to assess left ventricular function. Right ventricular systolic time intervals and specific Doppler flow velocity measurements were used to assess right ventricular function and elevation of pulmonary artery pressure. Comparisons were made between patients with severe and mild illness and between acute and follow-up studies. No statistically significant differences in left ventricular function, right ventricular systolic time intervals, or Doppler flow measurements were observed. We conclude that in patients with structurally normal hearts, respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis is not associated with significant depression of cardiac performance or elevation in pulmonary resistance.\r"

  ".W": "In 1984, the Committee on Sports Medicine of the American Academy of Pediatrics published in this journal a statement on the remarkably high incidence of atlantoaxial instability among individuals with Down syndrome. On the assumption that this instability, demonstrable through a specified series of lateral x-ray films of the neck, constituted a predisposition to cervical spine dislocation with subsequent spinal cord compression, the Academy supported and made more specific a series of recommendations that had originated from the Kennedy Foundation a year previously. In essence, for those persons who are found to have the radiographic sign of instability, participation in sports should be restricted. Because the implementation of these recommendations could deprive tens of thousands of individuals with Down syndrome of activities that are emotionally and physically beneficial and because of the rarity of reported cervical dislocations associated with injury, a case review was done. Included were those cases cited as support for the recommendations along with additional reports that had been omitted and a few cases reported subsequently. Little support for the hypothesis that atlantoaxial \"instability\" is a predisposing factor to \"dislocation\" was found, although much was found to indicate an urgent need for carefully designed longitudinal studies. Because nearly all of the cases of actual dislocation were preceded by at least several weeks of readily detectable physical signs, a physical examination with careful attention to neurologic signs prior to participation in sports is more predictive of potential or impending dislocation than the radiologic criteria currently recommended.\r"

Initial reasons for forming multicorporate structures centered on avoiding regulations governing certified home health agencies and maximizing third party payer reimbursement. As competition increased, home care agencies employed diversification strategies for survival and reorganized their single corporate structures to launch new businesses and engage in profit-making activities. Corporate restructuring is a time-consuming and complex endeavor that should only be undertaken as a part of an agency's strategic plan. Evaluating an agency's corporate structure is a continual process and the criteria for evaluating change over time. The current experience with diversification in the health care industry suggests that the proliferation of multicorporate structures is stemming as health care providers begin to refocus on their core business.\r"

  ".U": "88217898\r", 
  ".W": "We have studied pp60c-src expression in the striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum of the developing rat brain. In the striatum, pp60c-src protein kinase activity peaks during embryonic development and then declines in the adult. The peak activity occurs in the striatum on embryonic day 20 (E20) when it is 18- to 20-fold higher than the activity in fibroblasts and 4- to 5-fold higher than the activity in the striatum at E15 or in the adult striatum. In the hippocampal region, pp60c-src activity reaches a maximum shortly after birth but remains high throughout life. On postnatal day 2 (P2) the activity in the hippocampus is 9- to 13-fold higher than the activity in fibroblasts and twice as high as the activity in the hippocampus at E18. In the cerebellum, the kinase activity remains constant from E20 onward and is 6- to 10-fold higher than that observed in fibroblasts. The increase in pp60c-src kinase activity observed during the development of the striatum and hippocampus is due to an increase in the amount of pp60c-src protein and to an increase in the specific activity of the kinase. The increase in specific activity in these regions coincides with the peak periods of neurogenesis and neuronal growth. In the striatum, we have found that the increase in pp60c-src activity also parallels the increase observed in culture as embryonic striatal neurons differentiate. Taken together, our results are consonant with the idea that pp60c-src is the product of a developmentally regulated gene that is important for the differentiation and/or the continuing function of neurons.\r"

This sequence is defined by its ability to block the action of a signal sequence that either precedes or follows it. To our knowledge, this is the first entirely polar topogenic element. Deletion analysis shows that the role of the leader peptidase hydrophobic helper sequence in its membrane assembly is to overcome the block to assembly caused by the poison sequence.\r"

  ".W": "Reverse transcriptase of the avian sarcoma and leukosis retroviruses is a heterodimer composed of a 63-kDa alpha and a 95-kDa beta polypeptide chain, both of which are encoded in the pol gene and are produced by proteolytic processing of a larger precursor. We previously constructed a bacterial expression clone of the entire pol coding region that produces a protein 4 kDa larger than the mature viral beta subunit. By use of this clone and synthetic oligonucleotides to introduce stop codons, two derivatives have been constructed: one that directs synthesis of a protein equivalent to the mature beta subunit and the other that directs synthesis of a protein equivalent to alpha subunit. Predicted amino acid sequences of these proteins differ from their viral counterparts only by an initiator methionine that was added to the N termini for expression in Escherichia coli. Both bacterially expressed proteins exhibit reverse transcriptase activity and appear to function as homodimers. The properties of these proteins resemble those of the viral reverse transcriptase heterodimer; however, the bacterially produced alpha dimer protein could be distinguished from the other proteins by its increased sensitivity to heat inactivation, which also has been reported for the corresponding viral product. These results show that correct folding and expression of enzymatic function does not require formation of a precursor. The alpha and beta clones provide a convenient source of individual pol gene products for further evaluation of their roles in the synthesis and integration of retroviral DNA.\r"

  ".W": "Mature viral-encoded proteins of tobacco etch virus (TEV) arise by proteolytic processing of a large precursor. The proteinase responsible for most of these cleavages is a viral-encoded 49-kDa protein. All known or predicted cleavage sites in the TEV polyprotein are flanked by the conserved sequence motif Glu-Xaa-Xaa-Tyr-Xaa-Gln-Ser or Gly, with the scissile bond located between the Gln-Ser or Gly dipeptide. By using cell-free systems to manipulate and express cloned cDNA sequences, a 25-amino acid segment containing a putative proteolytic cleavage site of the TEV polyprotein has been introduced into the TEV capsid protein sequence. This recombinant protein is cleaved by the 49-kDa proteinase at the introduced cleavage site, thus demonstrating portability of a functional cleavage site. The role of the conserved amino acid sequence in determining substrate activity was tested by construction of engineered proteins that contained part or all of this motif. A protein that harbored an insertion of the conserved 7-amino acid segment was cleaved by the 49-kDa TEV proteinase. Cleavage of the synthetic precursor was shown to occur accurately between the expected Gln-Ser dipeptide by microsequence analysis. Proteins containing insertions that generated only the Gln-Ser, or only the serine moiety of the conserved sequence, were insensitive to the 49-kDa proteinase.\r"

Serial replating of the blast cell colonies in the presence of G-CSF, however, failed to demonstrate any direct effect of G-CSF on murine multipotential progenitors. We therefore examined the effects of G-CSF in combination with murine interleukin 3 on proliferation of murine blast cell colony-forming cells. The time course of total colony formation and multilineage colony formation by spleen cells harvested from mice 4 days after injection of 5-fluorouracil at 150 mg/kg was significantly shortened in cultures containing both factors in contrast with cultures supported by either factor alone. Serial observations of individual multipotential blast cell colonies (mapping) revealed that blast cell colonies emerged at random time intervals in the presence of interleukin 3 or G-CSF. The appearance of blast cell colonies, however, was significantly hastened in cultures containing both factors relative to cultures grown with either factor. In cultures of day-2 post-5-fluorouracil bone marrow cells, G-CSF in concentrations as low as 1 unit/ml revealed synergism with interleukin 3 in supporting the proliferation of multipotential progenitors. This synergistic activity may explain the previous in vivo studies suggesting the effects of G-CSF on apparent multipotential stem cells.\r"

The gene encoding Fis maps at 72 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome. The construction of mutant strains of E. coli that lack a functional fis gene demonstrates that Fis is not essential for cell growth under laboratory conditions but is required for high rates of Hin-mediated site-specific inversion in vivo.\r"

The library contains enough recombinant clones (each clone encoding approximately one amino acid replacement mutation) to predict a mutation at each nucleotide position of the alpha 1 exon. The functional analysis of the first five transfected gene products tested has shown that mutation of a conserved tyrosine at position 27 to asparagine destroys recognition of the H-2Dp gene product by polyclonal alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Recognition of the same mutant molecule by three monoclonal antibodies and H-2-restricted lymphocytic choriomenengitis virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes is unaffected.\r"

To determine if such changes might be correlated with therapeutic outcome, we studied steady-state mRNA levels of MYC and histone H3 in the leukemic blasts of patients just prior to and 24 hr after the administration of the first doses of antileukemic drug therapy. Among nine patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, mRNA levels of MYC and histone H3 were reduced in five patients, and hematologic remission was achieved in three of these individuals. No remission was obtained in the four patients without reduction in MYC and histone H3 mRNA. Among acute lymphocytic leukemia patients, the mRNA levels of MYC and/or histone H3 were reduced by the therapy in seven of nine patients. A complete hematologic remission was obtained in five of them, and a partial remission was obtained in the other two. No remission was obtained in the patients in which MYC and H3 mRNA levels were unaffected by the therapy. These studies are of interest because they suggest that a decrease in the mRNA levels of MYC and histone H3 24 hr after a single dose of antineoplastic drugs may predict which patients will achieve complete remission; lack of reduction in these mRNAs correlates with failure to achieve remission. In addition, these studies also provide further proof of the heterogeneity of altered growth regulation among human leukemias.\r"

We have found two in vitro parallels of treponemal invasiveness. We tested whether motile T. pallidum could invade host cells by determining the fate of radiolabeled motile organisms added to a HeLa cell monolayer; 26% of treponemes associated with the monolayer in a trypsin-resistant niche, presumably between the monolayer and the surface to which it adhered, but did not attain intracellularity. Attachment of T. pallidum to cultured human and rabbit aortic and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was 2-fold greater than to HeLa cells. We added T. pallidum to aortic endothelial cells grown on membrane filters under conditions in which tight intercellular junctions had formed. T. pallidum was able to pass through the endothelial cell monolayers without altering tight junctions, as measured by electrical resistance. In contrast, heat-killed T. pallidum and the nonpathogen Treponema phagedenis biotype Reiter failed to penetrate the monolayer. Transmission electron micrographs of sections of the monolayer showed T. pallidum in intercellular junctions. Our in vitro observations suggest that these highly motile spirochetes may leave the circulation by invading the junctions between endothelial cells.\r"

SMA is morphologically similar to but immunologically distinct from the Norwalk agent. SMA has been partially purified from the stool of experimentally infected volunteers and contains a single structural protein of Mr 62,000 as well as one or more non-virion-associated soluble proteins. Further characterization of this important human pathogen and other Norwalk-like viruses has been hindered by the lack of reagents with which to study them. To further characterize SMA, we developed a monoclonal antibody to SMA using in vitro immunization--a technique that permitted use of small quantities of antigen for immunization. The monoclonal antibody, SM-4, was specific for SMA and did not react with the Norwalk or Hawaii agents. In addition, SM-4 reacted with purified virion but not with the soluble protein. SM-4 also blocked the ability of labeled postinfection human IgG to bind to purified virion. Finally, both SM-4 and human postinfection sera specifically recognized the Mr 62,000 virion-associated protein. Thus, SM-4 is directed against an epitope present on the SMA structural protein that is not shared by the Norwalk or Hawaii agents and that is not present on the soluble protein. The availability of a monoclonal antibody against SMA should facilitate further purification and characterization of this agent. The techniques utilized in these studies provide a method for the production of additional monoclonal antibodies to this group of viruses and also should be useful for the study of other occult viral agents.\r"

Making use of the prompt and dramatic response of the visual cortex to occlusion of vision in one eye during the critical period, we tested the role of postsynaptic activity in ocular dominance plasticity. To do so, we selectively blocked cortical cell discharges with a continuous intracortical infusion of the inhibitory neurotransmitter agonist muscimol during a period of monocular deprivation. This drug inhibits cortical cell discharges with no apparent effect on the activity of their presynaptic geniculocortical inputs. Recording from single cortical cells after they had recovered from the muscimol-induced blockade, we found a consistent shift in the responsiveness of the visual cortex in favor of the less-active, closed eye, while the normal shift in favor of the more-active, open eye was evident in regions not affected by the treatment. Such an inhibition-coupled expression of plasticity in favor of the less-active, closed eye cannot be explained by a nonspecific disruption of cortical function. We interpret these results to indicate (i) that the postsynaptic cell is crucially involved in plasticity of the visual cortex, (ii) that the direction of cortical plasticity depends on postsynaptic membrane conductance or polarization, and (iii) that plasticity can occur in the absence of postsynaptic spike activity.\r"

By means of a novel method to deplete the kidney of resident leukocytes, essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), this hypothesis was tested in an intact, vascular organ. Kidneys subjected to EFAD and thus depleted of resident Ia-positive macrophages survived and functioned when transplanted across a major histocompatibility antigen barrier in the absence of immunosuppression of the recipient. Control allografts were rejected promptly. Allografts from donors subjected to EFAD normalized their lipid composition and were repopulated with host macrophages by 5 days. Administration of Ia-positive cells at the time of transplantation established that the resident leukocyte depletion induced by EFAD was responsible for the protective effect. These observations may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying tissue immunogenicity and the population of normal tissues with resident leukocytes.\r"

  ".W": "An expression system was developed that allows the production of a completely functional antigen-binding fragment of an antibody in Escherichia coli. The variable domains of the phosphorylcholine-binding antibody McPC603 were secreted together into the periplasmic space, where protein folding as well as heterodimer association occurred correctly. Thus, the assembly pathway for the Fv fragment in E. coli is similar to that of a whole antibody in the eukaryotic cell. The Fv fragment of McPC603 was purified to homogeneity with an antigen-affinity column in a single step. The correct processing of both signal sequences was confirmed by amino-terminal protein sequencing. The functionality of the recombinant Fv fragment was demonstrated by equilibrium dialysis. These experiments showed that the affinity constant of the Fv fragment is identical to that of the native antibody McPC603, that there is one binding site for phosphorylcholine in the Fv fragment, and that there is no inactive protein in the preparation. This expression system should facilitate future protein engineering experiments on antibodies.\r"

The production in Escherichia coli of foreign heterodimeric protein reagents, such as Fab, should prove useful in the management of human disease.\r"

Positive reactions were obtained with the PIFT in 67 percent, the P-ELISA in 41 percent, and the P-RIA in 49 percent of 85 cell-serum pairs. The same cell-serum combinations gave 49 percent positive reactions in the lymphocyte immunofluorescence test. Three multispecific HLA antisera were positive in nine of nine cell-serum combinations by all four methods. Thirteen transfusions were given to eight patients with known HLA antibodies. All donor-recipient pairs were LCT positive, six were PIFT positive, and seven were PIFT negative. Three of seven PIFT-negative and none of six PIFT-positive transfusions were successful. Thus, platelet crossmatching is less sensitive than the LCT for the detection of complement-binding monospecific HLA antibodies. The platelet crossmatch, however, is able to identify some potentially successful HLA-incompatible donors for patients with multispecific HLA antibodies and limited access to HLA-identical donors.\r"

Diagnoses made by TREACT, including 121 reactions, were compared with those of the medical directors over a 6-month period. The overall diagnostic concordance between the medical directors and the program was 0.777. When this was corrected for chance association (kappa statistic), the concordance was 0.703 (p less than 0.0001), which can be interpreted on a qualitative scale as substantial agreement. The program has also been used successfully as a tool for training new technologists. Other advantages and possibilities that expert systems offer to transfusion medicine are discussed.\r"

The survival of the transfused RBCs was 100 and 93 percent at 1 and 24 hours, respectively, with a half life of 21 days at termination of the study (normal, 28 to 32 days). These results showed no evidence of rapid destruction of the Yt(b+) RBCs, indicating that this patient could be transfused safely with blood from Yt(b+) donors. Long-term survival of the 51Cr-labeled Yt(b+) RBCs was shortened moderately, however, a finding that correlated with a slightly abnormal monocyte monolayer assay test.\r"

After an 8-week open period, 19 patients were randomized to continue enalapril or to receive a placebo in a double-blind manner. After the first enalapril dose of 10 mg, maximal reduction of blood pressure (BP) occurred after 4 hours (mean 34/17 mmHg; p less than 0.001). No further reduction was found after higher doses. After the open period significant improvement was shown as judged by NYHA class (p less than 0.01), stroke volume (p less than 0.05), maximal working capacity (p less than 0.05), heart volume (p less than 0.01) and maximum rate pressure product (RPPmax) (p less than 0.001). Urinary aldosterone markedly decreased (p less than 0.01), whereas serum potassium and serum creatinine slightly increased (p less than 0.05). At the end of the blind period enalapril was superior to placebo concerning NYHA class (p less than 0.01), heart volume (p less than 0.05) and RPPmax (p less than 0.05). Other parameters, including aldosterone in urine, did not differ between the groups. Carry-over effects may have diminished the differences between enalapril and placebo. Diarrhoea (n = 5) and hypotension (n = 5) were the most common side-effects. Overall, enalapril was well tolerated and seems to be useful in single daily doses in the treatment of CHF.\r"

Enalapril had no adverse effect on any lipid fractions, while Timolol increased very low (VLDL) + low (LDL) density lipoprotein cholesterol by 7.6% (p less than 0.001) and total triglycerides by 34.5% (p less than 0.001), and decreased the favorable high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 11.3% (p less than 0.001). Thus, the ratio HDL/VLDL + LDL cholesterol was reduced by 17.1% (p less than 0.001). Enalapril reduced uric acid by 3.4% (NS), while Timolol increased uric acid by 4.0% (p less than 0.05). The difference between the groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.01).

The wide availability of sonography, its modest cost, and its lack of ionizing radiation are other reasons that its use in musculoskeletal conditions is expected to increase. We have reviewed potential applications; some of these applications are new and have been used in a small series of patients, and others, such as infant hip sonography, have already been used in thousands of cases. Additional applications may be possible [64]. Those learning the techniques of musculoskeletal sonography will find that progress is made most quickly when there is close cooperation between the sonographer and the clinician. While experience is being gained, each party must endeavor to understand what the technique is able to determine and what it cannot determine. Only through close cooperation, and with adequate opportunity to learn, will the sonographer and the clinician develop confidence in the technique to the point that it becomes the effective imaging alternative that best suits the needs of the patient.\r"

Angiography defines the need for revascularization or retransplantation, but the value of noninvasive imaging in this setting is not clear. To assess the relative merit of noninvasive imaging techniques (sonography, scintigraphy, CT, and MR), we retrospectively reviewed 19 major vascular complications that occurred in 15 of 98 hepatic recipients over a 3 1/2-year period. Portal venous thrombosis was seen in seven patients, donor aortic or hepatic arterial thrombosis in seven, and inferior vena caval thrombosis in five. Sonography provided the initial diagnosis of portal venous thrombosis in three, arterial compromise in five, and caval obstruction in four. CT was the first diagnostic examination to identify portal occlusion in two, donor aortic thrombosis in one, and inferior vena caval thrombosis in one. Scintigraphy and MR imaging provided complementary data. Both sonography and CT are useful in the evaluation of vascular complications that occur after hepatic transplantation; however, neither is sufficiently sensitive to obviate angiographic assessment.\r"

  ".W": "Renal sonography was performed in 36 patients with clinical and/or laboratory evidence of AIDS, usually because of deteriorating renal function. In 15 patients, histopathologic specimens were reviewed to characterize renal pathologic changes underlying the sonographic findings. Sonographic evaluation included determination of renal size and cortical echogenicity according to a standard grading system. Pathologic specimens were evaluated for tubular and glomerular abnormalities. Sonography showed either normal-sized or enlarged kidneys with grade I cortical echogenicity in 13 patients (36%), grade II in three patients (8%), and grade III in five patients (14%). Fifteen patients (42%) had normal renal echogenicity. In addition to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis the pathologic examination showed different degrees of tubular abnormalities. Striking, irregularly dilated, infolded tubules with flattened epithelium and intratubular deposits of proteinaceous material, and sometimes cystlike formation involving the medulla and cortex, were seen in two patients with grade III kidneys, and mild dilatation of the tubules was seen in four patients with grade I disease. Moderate tubular dilatation was observed in one patient with grade I disease. No significant tubular abnormality was seen in one patient with grade I disease or in seven patients with normal renal echogenicity. Although glomerular changes contribute to the increase in renal echogenicity, we postulate that the main factors responsible for the increased echogenicity in AIDS nephropathy are the striking tubular abnormalities seen in these patients.\r"

  ".U": "88220184\r", 
  ".W": "This study compares the sonographic and CT findings in a group of infants with macrocrania and correlates those findings with neurologic outcome to determine the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of sonography. Sonographic findings in 255 infants with macrocrania are described. Of the 195 term infants examined, 130 had normal sonograms, 11 (5.6%) had significant abnormalities, and 54 had increased intra- and/or extraaxial fluid spaces. Of the 60 former preterm infants, 33 had normal sonograms, four (6.7%) had significant abnormalities, and 23 had increased fluid spaces or small resolving germinal matrix hemorrhages. The patients with significant abnormalities usually had head circumferences greater than the 95th percentile and had neurologic abnormalities. There was good correlation between sonography and CT in 30 of the 36 patients evaluated by both. In six there was mild discrepancy in the volume of the extraaxial fluid. No significant abnormality was missed by sonography. CT did not contribute any additional information. Neurologic follow-up was available for 202 patients. Nineteen percent of the term infants and 24% of the former preterm infants were abnormal on neurologic follow-up. Most patients with normal sonograms were normal on follow-up. Twelve of the term and four of the preterm infants with normal sonograms were developmentally delayed on follow-up. Increased CSF in the ventricles and/or extraaxial spaces was a common abnormality, but it usually is associated with a normal neurologic outcome and represents \"benign macrocrania.\" We conclude that an infant with an enlarged or enlarging head should have a neurologic examination and head circumference measurement. If the patient has a head circumference greater than the 95th percentile, particularly if there are abnormal neurologic findings, further evaluation is indicated. Sonography is the initial procedure recommended since it accurately evaluates ventricular size, extraaxial fluid, and congenital malformations. If sonography is normal or shows mildly increased fluid spaces, then follow-up head circumference measurement and clinical evaluation will probably suffice. CT is indicated if there is a significant abnormality on sonography that requires further clarification.\r"

We analyzed 326 consecutive sonograms in 319 infants who presented with vomiting in order to further evaluate the sonographic criteria for the diagnosis of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Four observers retrospectively measured three parameters: (1) the thickness of the muscle in the wall of the gastric outlet, (2) the length of that muscle, and (3) the length of the pyloric channel. In the patients with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, muscle thickness was 4.8 +/- 0.6 mm, muscle length was 2.1 +/- 0.3 cm, and channel length was 1.8 +/- 0.3 cm. In the patients without hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, muscle thickness was 1.8 +/- 0.4 mm, muscle length was 1.3 +/- 0.3 cm, and channel length was 1.1 +/- 0.3 cm. The mean measurement for each parameter was significantly larger in patients who had hypertrophic pyloric stenosis than in those who did not (p less than .01). However, histograms of the three parameters show significant overlap in the measurements of muscle length and channel length between the patients with and those without hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The thickness of the muscle is the most discriminating and accurate criterion for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.\r"

Both commercial assays detected HIV antigen in all cultures by day 21; however, the Abbott HIV antigen EIA (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) detected HIV antigen three to seven days earlier in 15 of 48 cultures (31%), on the same day in 32 cultures (67%), and three days later in 1 culture (2%) when compared with the DuPont HIV antigen EIA (DuPont Laboratories, Wilmington, DE). In serial twofold dilution experiments, the Abbott HIV Ag EIA was found to have at least a twofold to eightfold increased sensitivity over the DuPont assay. Repeat testing of 15 initially positive supernatant fluids by both assays revealed that 13 of 15 and 12 of 15 were consistently positive by the Abbott and DuPont assays, respectively. The authors conclude that the Abbott EIA demonstrated better performance in this study than the DuPont EIA for detection of HIV in cell culture because of its shorter time-to-positivity and greater sensitivity.\r"

The rapid system, RapID SS/u (Innovative Diagnostic System Inc., Atlanta, GA) is a non-growth-dependent micro-method that identifies selected gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, and yeasts in two hours by detection of constitutive enzymes acting on chromogenic substrates. A total of 185 representative clinical urinary isolates were tested, including 24 gram-positive cocci, 140 gram-negative bacilli, and 21 yeasts. Identifications by the rapid system were compared with the ones obtained by reference conventional methods for gram-positive cocci and yeasts. For gram-negative bacilli, identifications were compared with the ones obtained by MicroScan Combo Panel (American MicroScan, Mahwah, NJ), and all discrepancies were resolved by testing with API 20E (Analytab Products, Plainview, NY). Overall, the RapID SS/u system correctly identified to genus 160 of 185 isolates (86.5%). For 14 additional isolates (7.6%) the system provided probability overlap identifications that required further testing. Two (1%) isolates failed to be identified, and nine isolates (4.9%) were misidentified by the system. Discrepancies involved five strains of Citrobacter, one Enterobacter, one Morganella, and one Providencia species. The authors conclude that the RapID SS/u system provided rapid and accurate genus identification of most microorganisms commonly isolated from urine.\r"

Homicidal pepper aspiration shares many of the features of more conventional child abuse: in each instance, the child was being punished, four of the seven assailants initially gave incorrect histories, and four children were chronically abused. The facts that each death occurred in a different state and that five of the seven homicides occurred within the two years preceding the preparation of this report suggest that this form of child abuse is not confined to any single part of the country and may be increasing in infrequency.\r"

  ".W": "The two major lesions of renal osteodystrophy are osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC) and osteomalacia (OM). OFC is the characteristic bone lesion of uremic hyperparathyroidism. Although renal failure causes predictable parathyroid hyperplasia, the precise pathogenetic mechanism is still not defined. The \"hyperphosphatemia-hypocalcemia-parathyroid hormone (PTH) hypersecretion\" sequence of events is no longer an adequate model for the pathogenesis of uremic hyperparathyroidism. Other abnormalities associated with uremia include reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) synthesis, changes in intracellular phosphorus content or transcellular phosphate fluxes, or alteration in PTH metabolism, eg, change in set-point for PTH secretion. Each abnormality interacts with others and contributes to PTH hypersecretion, but none can completely account for the development and persistence of hyperparathyroidism in renal failure. The possibility that uremia may directly cause parathyroid hyperplasia remains open. It is also possible that factor(s) that initiate hyperparathyroidism may turn out to be quite different from that which sustains the hyperparathyroid state. Although both vitamin D-deficient and vitamin D-resistant OM may develop in patients with renal failure, the majority of uremic OM seen currently is \"vitamin D-refractory.\" Although now there is persuasive evidence implicating aluminum (Al) accumulation as the major pathogenetic cause for the mineralization defect seen in this disorder, additional disturbances may play important contributory roles. Such factors would include extraskeletal effects of Al, differences in host-susceptibility to this element, the localization of Al within bone, uremia per se, and the participation of other metals and toxins. Finally, possible interactions between hyperparathyroidism and OM of uremia are speculated on.\r"

Testing included screening enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for HIV antibodies, competitive EIA for envelope and core antibodies, EIA for HIV antigen, and lymphocyte culture. Five (6%) of the patients had positive screening EIA at low reactivity. Four of these five had antibodies to H-9 cellular antigens. Comparison of the five seropositive patients to matched controls showed no significant differences in number of lymphocytes or helper/suppressor ratio. Six months later, the five patients had negative screening EIA results using a kit with a manufacturing change approved by the Food and Drug Administration that provided improved specificity. In addition, their Western blot analysis was negative. We conclude that (1) false-positive screening EIA results are more common in chronic hemodialysis patients than other populations; (2) evaluation of chronic hemodialysis patients for HIV infection requires confirmatory tests; and (3) newer EIA screening kits appear to have improved specificity.\r"

Careful documentation of HIV antibody status of the donor and recipient, when available, the nature of immunosuppressive therapy used, the type of infections and their timing after transplantation, as well as the patient's absolute T4 lymphocyte count, T cell ratio, and B cell humoral response to infection were used as factors to distinguish between infection related to immunosuppressive therapy and that seen in HIV-induced immunodeficiency. Reduction in immunosuppressive therapy because of the HIV-related immunodeficiency state did not result in allograft rejection. Both patients died of their multiple infections. The determination of AIDS in the transplant recipient has both therapeutic and prognostic significance. This diagnosis should be considered when transplant patients develop unusual infections in relationship to their posttransplant course.\r"

Of the five discordant twin pregnancies with diamnionic-dichorionic placentas, all unaffected twins demonstrated an amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein concentration within the normal range for gestational age with a normal acetylcholinesterase level. In three twin pairs with diamnionic-monochorionic placentas, the unaffected twin member had significantly elevated amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase levels, which suggested diffusion of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase through the amnion-amnion interface.\r"

This prompted us to reexamine the policy (adopted by an increasing number of departments) of relying exclusively on ultrasound examination for the detection of spinal lesions. In this article we therefore analyze the number of additional cases of spina bifida that could be detected by offering maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening in addition to a routine ultrasound examination. Our calculations are made on the basis of published assessments of the performance of these tests and on the assumptions about test independence. We test our conclusions against a wide variety of test performance values in a detailed sensitivity analysis. The final decision to carry out maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein testing is a value judgment, but this decision should be based on realistic numeric estimates of the potential benefits and hazards of this procedure.\r"

In that report the ability to detect fetal-pelvic disproportion in patients with macrosomic fetuses was not specifically addressed. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of three methods used to identify the presence or absence of fetal-pelvic disproportion (the fetal-pelvic index, Colcher-Sussman x-ray pelvimetry, and estimated fetal weight greater than or equal to 4000 gm) in patients delivered of neonates weighing greater than or equal to 4000 gm after an adequate trial of labor (N = 34). Of the 18 patients requiring operative intervention, all but one had a positive fetal-pelvic index value (sensitivity = 94%). Of the 16 patients in whom vaginal deliveries were spontaneous, all but one had a negative value (specificity = 94%). On the basis of these data, the fetal-pelvic index is an accurate method of predicting the presence or absence of fetal-pelvic disproportion in patients delivered of neonates weighing greater than or equal to 4000 gm.\r"

Using a computerized analysis system for simultaneously acquired biophysical variables, we studied 200 high-risk fetuses near term. The dynamic parameters obtained for each fetus were compared with established nomograms, and overall test results correlated with the presence or absence of perinatal mortality, fetal distress, a 5-minute Apgar score less than 7, and intrauterine growth retardation for those delivered within 7 days of the last test. A test was considered abnormal if two or more parameters fell more than 2 standard deviations from the population mean. A decreased incidence of fetal body movements, amniotic fluid volume, and frequency of FHR acceleration were the most common individual test abnormalities. Test sensitivity (86%), specificity (89%), positive predictive value (75%), and negative predictive value (93%) exceeded those of the \"standard\" scoring approach and correctly identified all fetuses with malformation, perinatal death, and 19 of 22 fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was undertaken to examine whether Doppler velocimetry studies of the umbilical artery give a better or an earlier prediction of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) than do sonographic estimation of fetal weight. A total of 385 examinations were performed between 30 and 42 weeks of gestation on 168 patients who were at risk for IUGR. Forty-two (25%) of the patients delivered an infant with a birth weight below the tenth percentile. Although sensitivity was lower for the systolic to diastolic ratio (55%) of the umbilical artery than for the sonographic estimation of fetal weight (76%), the umbilical artery studies had a higher specificity (92% versus 80%) and predictive value of a positive test (73% versus 58%) when the last study to delivery interval was within 2 weeks. Furthermore, among 21 IUGR pregnancies with serial studies, the umbilical systolic to diastolic ratio was abnormal at a significantly earlier gestational age than when the sonographic estimate of fetal weight identified growth retardation. These findings indicate that sonographic biometry is a more sensitive technique for identifying IUGR but that the umbilical artery waveforms are a valuable adjunct for improving the diagnostic accuracy for the prenatal detection of IUGR. These data also provide suggestive evidence that umbilical artery velocimetry may be predictive of IUGR at an earlier gestational age than sonographic estimation of fetal weight.\r"

The initial glucose and maternal hemoglobin A1 values of the latter group experiencing spontaneous abortions were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) when compared with women receiving preconceptional diabetologic counseling whose pregnancies continued beyond 22 weeks' gestation. The frequency of spontaneous abortions among patients not seen before pregnancy was significantly higher (p less than 0.001), in contrast to attending women, whose rate represented the normal rate in the general population. We confirm the evidence accumulated in the recent literature that poor metabolic control around conception and in the early weeks of pregnancy may be the determining factor favoring abortion.\r"

These data suggest that the decreased glucose utilization by maternal red muscles observed during pregnancy and fasting is related to the increase in circulating fat-derived substrates, because the fall in plasma insulin concentration is a specific adaptation to fasting.\r"

Several reports have shown correlations between the intake of or recent withdrawal from psychoactive substances and changes in DST results. A review of the DST literature reveals that these effects have not been controlled in most DST studies. It is therefore possible that the consequences of intake of psychotropic agents may have contributed to the debate surrounding the DST by producing unappreciated spurious DST results.\r"

Four groups totaling 31,207 teenagers were examined: Black non-Latinos (51 per cent), White non-Latinos (17 per cent), Puerto Ricans (25 per cent), and non-Puerto Rican Latinos (8 per cent). Multivariate regressions were fit for each group. Simulations based on the regressions reveal that the proportion of live births plus induced abortions among unmarried 18-year-olds, on Medicaid, with a previous live birth, no previous induced abortions, and nine years of completed schooling was .55 in the case of Puerto Ricans, .34 for non-Puerto Rican Latinos, .60 for Blacks, and .51 for Whites. For nulliparous adolescents of the same age and marital status, with an additional year of schooling, but not on Medicaid, and with a previous induced abortion, the fraction of pregnancies that were terminated rose to .84 in the case of Puerto Ricans, .81 for non-Puerto Rican Latinos, .87 for Blacks, and .96 for Whites. The results suggest that attitudes toward abortion as proxied by previous induced terminations substantially increase the likelihood of aborting as well as narrow the racial and ethnic differences with respect to pregnancy resolution.\r"

In the Caucasian patient, it frequently arises in a background of cirrhosis, most commonly the alcoholic type. In the present study, the alpha-feto-protein level was increased in less than half of the Caucasian patients. In comparison, hepatocellular carcinoma in Oriental patients most often occurs in livers with postinfectious cirrhosis. In the present study, both hepatitis B surface antigen and an increased alpha-fetoprotein level were present in three of four patients. If the tumor is present, however, it appears to behave similarly in both ethnic groups. Without resection, the prognosis is poor, regardless of the presence or absence of underlying cirrhosis or hepatitis B surface antigen status. A tissue diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is most readily made by ultrasonographically guided fine-needle aspiration, which has an 81 percent sensitivity. The most important factor affecting survival is surgical resection. Clearly, the stage at diagnosis is also crucial, but even in more advanced disease, operation can improve survival. It also appears that an increased carcinoembryonic antigen level above normal or a markedly increased alpha-fetoprotein level or both are associated with poor survival. However, whether this is a reflection of tumor size alone, or in fact represents a more aggressive tumor is uncertain and will require further study.\r"

It is important to recognize the major causes of intestinal morbidity in these patients and to be aware of the cause and natural progression of the entity of acute graft-versus-host disease. Of 89 patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation over a 6 year period, acute intestinal graft versus host disease developed in 29 (33 percent). Although surgical consultation for abdominal pain and peritonism was requested for 15 of these patients, intestinal perforation did not occur, and only two patients underwent laparotomy, both for obstruction (and hemorrhage in one case). Patients who require operation tend to be in the end stages of the disease, and the chance for salvage appears to be remote.\r"

Ninety patients had secondary disease and 20 patients had tertiary disease after renal transplantation. From these two groups, 18 patients had repeat operations for control of recurrent or persistent disease. The incidence of repeat operations was 14 percent. Causes were graft-dependent hyperparathyroidism, supernumerary glands in the neck or mediastinum, and incomplete identification of glands in the neck. The most important risk factor is continued long-term dialysis in functionally anephric patients. We recommend that patients with hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure undergo total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation. If repeat operation is necessary, a reduction in glandular mass with autotransplantation is preferred. In selected patients, total parathyroidectomy can be considered because of the increased risk of aluminum bone disease.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate nasally administered sufentanil, 1.5-4.5 micrograms/kg, for pre-induction (i.e., pre-medication/induction) of anesthesia in pediatric patients, the authors studied ASA PS 1 or 2 patients scheduled for elective surgery. Eighty children, ages 6 months to 7 yr, were randomized to receive sufentanil (1.5, 3.0, or 4.5 micrograms/kg) or placebo (normal saline, 0.03 ml/kg) nasally over 15-20 s. Induction of anesthesia was completed with 5% halothane and O2 via facemask. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with N2O (60-70%) and halothane, as clinically indicated. A blinded observer remained with the child from prior to drug administration until discharge from the recovery room. Patients given sufentanil were more likely to separate willingly from their parents and be judged as calm at or before 10 min compared to those given saline. Ventilatory compliance during induction of anesthesia decreased markedly in 25% of subjects given sufentanil, 4.5 micrograms/kg. Subjects given sufentanil moved or coughed less during tracheal intubation and required less halothane compared to those given placebo. During recovery, patients given sufentanil cried less and fewer needed analgesics; recovery times were similar for all groups. However, patients given sufentanil, 4.5 micrograms/kg, had a higher incidence of vomiting in the recovery room and during the first postoperative day. The authors conclude that nasally administered sufentanil, 1.5 or 3.0 micrograms/kg, facilitates separation of children from parents, has minimal side effects, may improve intubating conditions, and can provide postoperative analgesia.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of clonidine on intraocular pressure and perioperative cardiovascular variables were studied by a randomized double blind design in 80 elderly patients (ASA physical status I-III) scheduled for elective ophthalmic surgery under general anesthesia (GA) and local anesthesia (LA). Group 1 (n = 40), the control group, received diazepam po (0.1 mg.kg-1) 90-120 min prior to arrival to the operating room. Group 2 (n = 40) received clonidine po approximately 5 micrograms.kg-1 po at the same time. Each group was divided into subgroups of 20 patients each to be managed with GA (GA subset) or LA (LA subset). Ninety to 120 minutes after the premedication, a large decrease in IOP from 20 +/- 3 to 12 +/- 3 mmHg (P less than 0.01) and a small but significant reduction of both systolic and diastolic BP and HR were observed in patients receiving clonidine, while no changes occurred in controls. In the patients managed with GA, clonidine effectively prevented IOP rise and attenuated the associated cardiovascular response (P less than 0.01) following laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, and significantly reduced intraoperative cardiovascular lability and anesthetic requirement for isoflurane (P less than 0.05) and for fentanyl (P less than .001). In patients managed with LA, intraoperative systolic (P less than 0.01) and diastolic BP and HR variability (P less than 0.05) were significantly lower in patients receiving clonidine as compared to controls. Intraoperatively, a significantly higher incidence of hypertension (P less than 0.01) and tachycardia (P less than 0.05) were respectively observed in the LA subset and GA subset of the controls when contrasted with the corresponding subset of those receiving clonidine. Moreover, clonidine was more effective than diazepam as a premedication; in fact, satisfactory intraoperative sedation and cardiovascular stability were observed in 85% of the patients who received clonidine, and in 50% of those patients who did not receive clonidine (P less than 0.01). Thus, clonidine may represent a useful adjunct in the management of the aged patient in the setting of ophthalmic surgery.\r"

Each patient received, in sequence: 1) 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine; 2) 6 ml of study solution 1 (bupivacaine-fentanyl group: 0.125% bupivacaine/0.0008% fentanyl; bupivacaine-only group: 0.25% bupivacaine alone); and 3) a continuous epidural infusion of study solution 2 at a rate of 12.5 ml/h (bupivacaine-fentanyl group: 0.0625% bupivacaine/0.0002% fentanyl; bupivacaine-only group: 0.125% bupivacaine alone). The epidural infusion was discontinued at full cervical dilatation, but patients who lacked perineal anesthesia received one or two 5-ml boluses of study solution 3 (bupivacaine-fentanyl group: 0.0625% bupivacaine alone; bupivacaine-only group: 0.125% bupivacaine alone). During the first stage of labor, 36 of 41 (88%) women in the bupivacaine-fentanyl group, and 37 of 39 (95%) women in the bupivacaine-only group, had analgesia of excellent or good quality (P = NS). During the second stage, 22 of 37 (59%) women in the bupivacaine-fentanyl group, and 23 of 35 (66%) women in the bupivacaine-only group, rated their analgesia as excellent or good (P = NS).

  ".W": "Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been used to prevent and treat venous air embolism in patients in the seated position undergoing neurosurgical operations. However, the safety of PEEP has recently been questioned, because of concern that PEEP might increase right atrial pressure (RAP) more than left atrial pressure, thereby predisposing patients with a probe-patent foramen ovale to paradoxical air embolism. In a prior study in dogs, the authors found that to up 10 cm H2O PEEP did not affect the interatrial pressure difference. In the present study, the authors examined the effects of 0, 5, and 10 cm H2O PEEP in 12 anesthetized neurosurgical patients positioned both supine and seated prior to operation. Measurements were made of systemic arterial pressure, RAP, mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), and cardiac output. PAWP was higher (average 2 mmHg) than RAP in all patients. PEEP increased RAP and PAWP in patients, both seated and supine (mean 3 mmHg at 10 cm H2O), but did not affect the PAWP-RAP difference. In an additional eight patients in the seated position, the authors examined the effects of 0, 10, and 20 cm H2O PEEP during operation. PEEP again increased PAWP and RAP, but did not significantly affect the PAWP-RAP difference. The PAWP-RAP difference became negative (-1 mmHg) in one patient with 20 cm H2O PEEP. The authors conclude that levels of PEEP up to 10 cm H2O do not alter the interatrial pressure difference in seated neurosurgical patients, and, therefore, would not predispose these patients to paradoxical air embolism.\r"

Serum specimens from each participant were genetically identical. Polymerase chain reaction showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from one subject at different times matched by HLA DNA typing.

All patients (9 women and 2 men) had a chronic autoimmune disorder, which rarely fulfilled the usual criteria for a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The disorder was characterized by acute or chronic (active or granulomatous) hepatitis; steroid-responsive blood cytopenia, often associated with a circulating anticoagulant, or anticardiolipin antibodies, or both; and cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis or probable brain vasculitis. Eight patients had at least two of these three conditions. Antilamin autoantibodies may thus be a marker for an unusual subset of autoimmune diseases.\r"

Immunizations that may be required by individual countries, such as yellow fever and cholera, may then be administered. Immunizations for diseases such as hepatitis, typhoid fever, and meningococcal disease can be given according to the type of exposure within each country. Restricting a traveler's diet to cooked foods and purified, carbonated, or heated beverages may prevent travelers' diarrhea and other enteric infections.

  ".W": "Experimental studies in animals have shown that therapy with high-dose interleukin-2 either alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells can reduce established pulmonary and hepatic metastases. Based on these experiments, recent clinical trials have shown that therapy with high-dose interleukin-2 alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells can mediate the regression of established metastatic disease in selected patients with advanced malignancy. Of 221 patients with advanced cancer treated with this immunotherapy, 16 have had a complete regression of all metastatic cancer, and an additional 26 have had a partial regression (greater than 50% reduction) of cancer. Toxicity from treatment was primarily due to increased capillary permeability, which led to fluid extravasation and organ dysfunction. Based on these findings, new approaches are being explored, including the use of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and combinations of lymphokines. These studies show that the regression of established growing cancer can be mediated by manipulating the immune system.\r"

  ".U": "88220880\r", 
  ".W": "Dyspepsia, defined as chronic or recurrent upper abdominal pain or nausea, is a common occurrence. Dyspepsia without an ulcer (non-ulcer dyspepsia) is diagnosed in patients at least twice as often as peptic ulceration. Diseases that may present with similar symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux, biliary tract disease, chronic pancreatitis, and irritable bowel syndrome. A careful history and physical examination, supplemented by selected tests, usually lead to a correct diagnosis. The pathogenesis of non-ulcer dyspepsia remains unknown. Gastric acid secretion, duodenogastric reflux, psychological factors, environmental exposures, and heredity probably do not play a major role. Some patients may have motility disturbances, but whether these disturbances cause dyspepsia is unknown. Campylobacter pylori infection and associated gastritis are common in non-ulcer dyspepsia, but their etiologic role is controversial, as is the importance of chronic duodenitis. By recognizing the heterogeneity of patients who present with non-ulcer dyspepsia, more rational management may be possible. Although an empiric trial of antacids or H2 blockers has been recommended to treat dyspepsia, most controlled trials show that although these substances reduce severity of symptoms, they are no more effective than placebos in non-ulcer dyspepsia.\r"

The coronary care unit has been widely accepted as the standard of care for patients with acute myocardial infarction and has been considered appropriate for monitoring patients with acute chest pain until acute myocardial infarction is diagnosed or excluded. However, rising health care costs have created pressures to increase the efficiency of coronary care units. Possible strategies seek to decrease resource use by identifying low-risk patients for initial triage or early transfer to lower levels of care. The application of management algorithms and the development of intermediate care units as alternative triage sites for low-risk patients may be important future trends as a distinction is made between intensive coronary care and careful coronary observation.\r"

Neutrophils from patients who survived had diminished intracellular-killing capacity for their own organisms, but normal capacity for killing laboratory organisms either matched or unmatched with the patients' own isolate's species. In these patients, the chemotactic index, the lymphocyte helper/suppressor ratio, and the serum IgG concentration remained within normal limits.

Adhesions requiring repeated operation to relieve bowel obstruction occurred in five of 87 patients with acute gangrenous appendicitis treated by inversion. Of 106 patients with acute gangrenous appendicitis treated with simple ligation, postoperative obstruction developed in none. No other statistically significant differences existed between the two techniques. These data suggest that simple ligation is at least as good as and probably better than inversion of the appendiceal stump.\r"

Naloxone was administered after arterial pressure had reached the nadir (more than two hours following initiation of E coli infusion). Mean arterial pressure was supported by the lower dose of naloxone; however, sustained leukopenia and neutropenia were not reversed by its infusion. Naloxone prevented the increase in plasma beta-endorphin level and blunted the increase in plasma cortisol level. Despite these effects, naloxone did not prevent multiple-organ disease and did not decrease mortality.\r"

To determine the incidence of free air associated with intra-abdominal viscus perforation, the medical records of 77 consecutive patients whose discharge or autopsy diagnosis included pneumoperitoneum or perforated viscus at a community hospital were retrospectively reviewed between June 1980 and October 1985. Abdominal viscus perforation, as determined by contrast studies or at operation, was not invariably associated with free air. Sixty-nine percent (23/33) of gastroduodenal, 30% (3/10) of small-bowel, and 37% (11/30) of large-bowel perforations had free air, as determined by preoperative x-ray film. Four cases with a total of six episodes of pneumoperitoneum were identified where viscus perforation was not documented. Pneumoperitoneum thus remains a reliable sign of viscus perforation; however, lack of this finding does not rule out perforation, and unusual causes must be considered.\r"

Fifty-nine patients were evaluable. A mean of 3.1 (moxalactam) and 3.5 (tobramycin-clindamycin) pathogens per patient were identified. Overall success rate was 85% (tobramycin-clindamycin, 24/30; moxalactam, 26/29). When patients with appendicitis were excluded, there was an observed but not statistically significant advantage of moxalactam over tobramycin-clindamycin (85% vs 67%). There were five deaths (tobramycin-clindamycin, four; moxalactam, one). Other complications included hypoprothrombinemia (tobramycin-clindamycin, five; moxalactam, five), renal dysfunction (tobramycin-clindamycin, three; moxalactam, one), and superinfection (tobramycin-clindamycin, nine; moxalactam, six). More wound infections were noted in the group given tobramycin-clindamycin. These data suggest that moxalactam is as safe and efficacious as tobramycin plus clindamycin. The observed benefits of this agent warrant study in a larger sample to verify advantages of moxalactam over combination therapy.\r"

To understand better the relationship between the neutrophil dysfunction, degranulation, and thermal injury, a rabbit model was studied. Eighteen rabbits were burned over 20% of their surface area. Assay of peripheral blood heterophils disclosed decreased migratory activity compared with preburn levels and decreased lysozyme content vs preburn levels, but no change in the beta-glucuronidase content. The specific binding of tritiated formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine to peripheral blood heterophils was increased fivefold over that of control cells. These studies indicate that, following thermal injury, there is a selective decrease of specific granule contents and an increase in chemoattractant binding to the cell and also suggest an abnormality in chemoattractant receptor processing. The rabbit provides a convenient model for the study of compromised host defenses following thermal injury.\r"

Balloon catheters were then advanced over the guidewire and distended with a water-contrast mixture. Sufficient pressure was applied to efface the stricture indentation of the balloon. Since August 1984, we have performed 12 dilatations in these six patients. We dilated four strictures to 20 mm and two strictures to 15 mm. With the exception of stenosis due to edema caused by cancer or radiation, balloon dilatation is an effective treatment of tight upper gastrointestinal tract strictures that have not responded to standard dilatation techniques.\r"

Diagnosis was usually obscure, despite modern invasive and noninvasive methods, and laparotomy or autopsy were required for specific identification of tumor type. Sixteen resections were reported among 18 explorations. One patient had transarterial embolization. Fifteen received medical therapy only. Surgically treated patients usually died of metastatic disease, whereas most medically treated patients died of gastrointestinal or tumor hemorrhage. Pedunculated HCC may be more amenable to curative resection than ordinary HCC due to its unique localization and growth pattern.\r"

We present three examples of complications of the localization procedure: (1) wire migration into the chest wall with retained fragment, (2) transection of a wire during biopsy with retained hook fragment, and (3) wire migration within the thigh soft tissues with breakage at the hooked end. Recommendations to minimize the incidence of these complications and their sequelae include (1) bending the hookwire 90 degree at the skin surface following localization, (2) transferring the patient between the radiology suite and the operating room via a stretcher, with minimal movement of the body part localized, and (3) accounting for the entire length of wire by the surgeon, pathologist, and radiologist following the procedure to exclude retained fragments.\r"

Delayed presentation may be heralded by symptoms referred to the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. An infant with unrecognized right-sided foramen of Bochdalek hernia presented with obstructive jaundice due to compression of the herniated common bile duct by the rim of the diaphragmatic defect. To our knowledge, this occurrence has not been previously observed in infancy or childhood.\r"

  ".W": "Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911), who was born in Yorkshire (England), was the most famous graduate of the York Medical School, which closed in 1862. In York, he received his earliest neurological influences under Laycock. Jackson's most outstanding contributions were in the field of epilepsy. His were the definitive studies of unilateral convulsions that led Charcot to introduce the term Jacksonian epilepsy. His radically new view of epilepsy in terms of discharging lesions was the first neuronal theory and the foundation stone of our modern understanding of the disorder. His theories were based on detailed clinical observation and were later confirmed by the experimental studies of Fritsch and Hitzig, and by his colleague David Ferrier. He was more concerned with the nature than with the classification of epilepsy, and he linked his concepts of the disease to his hierarchical views of nervous system function. His writings on epilepsy over 40 years are on a par with the Hippocratic writings on the Sacred Disease.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were conducted to evaluate the role of water-sodium balance and renal dopaminergic activity in the hypertensive mechanisms of overweight patients with essential hypertension (EHT). The body mass index (BMI) was correlated positively with mean arterial pressure, plasma volume, extracellular fluid volume, or total exchangeable sodium and negatively with plasma noradrenaline concentration or plasma renin activity in patients with EHT. Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) was significantly lower in overweight patients than in normal weight patients with EHT. Hypotensive effect of sodium restriction or the natriuretic response to infused dopamine was more remarkable in overweight patients with EHT than in normal weight patients with EHT. Urinary excretion of free dopamine (UDA) was correlated positively with simultaneously measured urinary excretion of sodium or FENa and negatively with the natriuretic response to dopamine infusion. In addition, UDA was positively correlated with the BMI in normal weight patients with EHT, whereas the relation between the UDA and the BMI was significantly negative in overweight patients with EHT. These findings suggest that the expansion of body fluid volume and sodium might result from the blunted natriuretic ability due to an attenuation of the renal dopaminergic activity in overweight patients with EHT. The expansion of body fluid volume and sodium may play an important role in the hypertensive mechanisms of overweight patients with EHT.\r"

  ".W": "In a multicenter, multinational study, 200 patients with essential hypertension were treated with a fixed dose of Enalapril (E) 20 mg/day after a 2- to 4-week placebo period. All had diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 100 to 120 mm Hg at the end of the placebo period. They were then given E for 6 weeks. If DBP after this was greater than 90 mm Hg they were randomized double-blind to added therapy with hydrochlorothiazide (H) either 25 mg/day (E + H 25) or 12.5 mg/day (E + H 12.5) or placebo (E + P) for 4 weeks. Blood pressure was measured approximately 24 hours after taking the medication. In the whole group, BP fell from 171/107 to 156/97 mm Hg during monotherapy with E (P less than 0.001). Sixty-six patients reached DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg on E alone. Of the remainder, 42 were randomized to E + P. In these, BP fell by 5.9/3.4 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). Forty-two patients received E + H 12.5 and BP fell by 9.0/6.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). Forty-one patients received E + H 25 and BP fell by 5.6/6.3 mm Hg (P less than 0.05/0.01). The proportion of patients who reached DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg was 26% in the E + P group, 48% in the E + H 12.5 group (P less than 0.05 compared to E + P group), and 38% in the E + H 25 group. There were no other significant differences between the E + H 12.5 and E + H 25 groups except that S-potassium fell significantly (-0.2 mmol/L) in E + H 25. Both regimens were remarkably well tolerated. It can be concluded that H 12.5 mg/day potentiates the effect of Enalapril 25 mg/day at least as well as H 25 mg/day and better than placebo.\r"
