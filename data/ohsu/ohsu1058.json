  ".W": "Increasing confidence in the ability of high-resolution ultrasound to detect neural tube and ventral wall defects has enabled us to offer a revised risk estimate to the patient with an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level, such that amniocentesis may not be necessary. Recent authors have suggested that a reduced emphasis on follow-up amniocentesis fails to consider an increased risk for chromosomal anomalies in pregnancies with an elevated MSAFP, and that amniocentesis should still be performed. We reviewed our ultrasound findings from patients who underwent amniocentesis for evaluation of an elevated MSAFP and who had a karyotype prepared from the amniotic fluid sample. Four abnormal karyotypes were detected among 313 amniocenteses, and three of these were correctly predicted based on an abnormal ultrasound. The risk of an unexpected fetal aneuploidy after a normal consultative ultrasound in our series was one in 310. This is comparable to the risk of detecting abnormal chromosomes in the fetus of a 32-year-old woman, an age at which amniocentesis is not routinely offered.\r"

Six pregnant ewes and their fetuses were instrumented under halothane general anesthesia at 113-119 days' gestation. Between 124-135 days' gestation, the ewes received a single infusion of vehicle or cocaine (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg) into the jugular vein. At least 24 hours was allowed between successive injections. Maternal and fetal blood samples were drawn at 30 and 20 minutes before and at 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after the injection. Both maternal and fetal glucose and lactate concentrations increased (P less than .05) after injection of cocaine at 2.0 mg/kg. There were no significant changes in maternal or fetal plasma insulin concentrations after vehicle or cocaine administration. Induction of hyperglycemia and lactacidemia could be mechanisms whereby cocaine exerts its adverse effects during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Laser conization of the cervix has been advocated as the technique of choice for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in preference to ablative techniques, because it provides a specimen for histologic diagnosis while retaining the advantages of an outpatient procedure with minimal short- and long-term morbidity. To determine whether specimens so obtained are adequate for reliable histologic diagnosis, we reviewed 77 laser conizations performed for lesions confirmed to contain CIN in a colposcopically directed biopsy and satisfying the criteria for local ablation and scored the cones for the presence of epithelial denudation and laser coagulation artifact that interfered with the diagnosis of CIN or the assessment of the margins of excision. Thirty specimens (39%) were negative for CIN. Twenty-eight (36%) showed extensive epithelial denudation, ten (13%) contained coagulation artifact that made recognition of CIN extremely difficult or impossible, and in 11 (14%), assessment of margins was extremely difficult or impossible because of laser coagulation artifact. We conclude that these difficulties with the histologic interpretation of laser cone specimens make it an unsuitable excisional technique when reliable histologic diagnosis of cervical lesions is required.\r"

The mean number of new cases of adenocarcinoma (N = 12) remained the same, while squamous cell cases decreased from 57 to 32. The clinical features were compared; oral contraceptive usage, node status, diabetes, and symptoms of bleeding were not related to cell type. Nulliparity was more frequent in patients with adenocarcinoma, whereas obesity and smoking were more frequent in patients with squamous cell cancer. Survival in stage I was significantly influenced by the cell type. Patients with stage I squamous cell disease had a 90% 5-year survival, compared with 60% for adenocarcinoma (P less than .0001). Other features that influenced survival included node status (P = .001), poor differentiation of tumor histology (P = .001), diabetes (P = .001), and Papanicolaou smear interval (P = .001). Patients undergoing radical hysterectomy were analyzed separately, and adenocarcinoma cell type significantly influenced survival (P = .0008). Patients with stage II squamous cell disease had a 62% survival, compared with 47% for adenocarcinoma (P = .01); patients with stage III squamous cell disease had a 36% survival, compared with 8% for adenocarcinoma (P = .002). The percentage of adenocarcinoma has increased because of the decreased number of patients with squamous cell disease. Stage-for-stage survival is significantly decreased for patients with adenocarcinoma as opposed to squamous cell disease.\r"

In contrast, six of 11 (55%) of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias contained HPV DNA by dot blot and/or Southern blot hybridization. Less than 50% of the invasive vulvar carcinomas contained detectable HPV DNA. The average age at onset of vulvar carcinoma is higher than that for cervical carcinoma (in which HPV DNA is detected in over 80% of cases). Therefore, the role of HPV in the genesis of vulvar carcinoma may be different from the role of HPV in the genesis of cervical carcinoma.\r"

Short-term cultures were successfully established for all specimens, and metaphase spreads were prepared by conventional techniques. Clonal chromosome rearrangements were detected in seven leiomyoma specimens (54%). These rearrangements involved chromosome bands 12q14-15 in five specimens, including three tumors with a specific translocation, t(12;14)(q14-15;q23-24). Chromosome rearrangements involving chromosome band 7q22 were identified in two specimens. A normal 46,XX karyotype was observed in six specimens. Myometrial specimens from two patients with abnormal leiomyoma karyotypes were normal cytogenetically. These results suggest that spontaneous chromosome rearrangements may be responsible for the initiation and proliferation of leiomyoma growth.\r"

The assay showed positive cytoplasmic staining, demonstrating a sensitivity of 83% in the patients with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. The specificity of the assay was 65% for the infertility patients and 76% for the infertility and gynecology patients combined. Several gynecologic cancer patients showed either nuclear or nuclear and cytoplasmic staining, but few showed exclusive cytoplasmic staining. These initial results suggest that detection of antibodies might be useful for the diagnosis of endometriosis.\r"

Thus, we sought to determine the effects in vitro and in vivo on sperm directly exposed to bromocriptine. Ten semen specimens from normal donors were diluted with Ham's F-10 medium and incubated with 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mmol/L bromocriptine solution or diluent without bromocriptine. Computerized semen analysis revealed a 31% decrease in sperm motility, a 24% decrease in sperm average path velocity, and a 33% decrease in sperm average straight line velocity only using 1.0 mmol/L of bromocriptine (P less than .05). In addition, eight women with hyperprolactinemia and infertility who were receiving vaginal bromocriptine consented to a postcoital test. Five became pregnant and delivered normal infants. Four of the five women who had a postcoital test had six, eight, ten, and ten motile sperm per high-power field and one had one to two motile sperm per high-power field. Because sperm function was preserved enough to result in fertilization and term pregnancy, the clinical importance of the in vitro findings is probably minimal and it can be concluded that vaginal bromocriptine can be used in women with infertility due to hyperprolactinemia.\r"

In recent years, in an attempt to determine whether work hours could be reduced while at least maintaining resident education and patient care, many program directors have instituted night float systems. In New York State, these systems must adhere to rigid hospital code requirements (limiting total hours worked and with specific mandates regarding time away from the hospital); in other areas, these requirements are not as limiting. At the request of the Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology, residency program directors and residents in the United States and Canada were sent a survey regarding whether they had a night float program, how it was structured, and what changes it was perceived to have caused. Responses were received from 193 program directors (65%) and 302 residents. Major differences were noted in the structure of the programs within New York state compared with those outside the state. In New York, 63% of the programs had residents in all 4 years participating in the night float; this was true for only 10% of the programs outside New York. In New York state, the programs were required to adhere to state hospital code requirements limiting hours on duty and mandating the specifics of time off, whereas the programs outside New York did not necessarily adhere to these restrictive requirements. Twelve characteristics were evaluated regarding changes that were perceived to have occurred as a result of the night float program.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We present a retrospective review of 147 patients undergoing abdominal sacral colpopexy using dacron graft or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. The anatomical basis of repair, operative technique, and results are described. Ninety-three percent of the patients experienced long-term success over 5 years, including those with previous failed repairs. Both short- and long-term complication rates were acceptable. Only four patients experienced graft erosion, and only one of those had recurrent prolapse. Abdominal sacral colpopexy offers those affected with genital prolapse an opportunity for long-term relief, with maintenance of a patent vagina.\r"

No preoperative or postoperative endometrial suppression was used. Rather, the endometrial cavity was denuded by suction curettage just before ablation, which was performed in the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. Lidocaine paracervical block containing vasopressin was injected at the start of the procedure to control pain and to minimize bleeding and irrigation fluid absorption. Pulsed irrigation of the uterus was used to improve visibility through uterine debris and the bubbles generated by the electrical current. The first 20 patients who had electrocoagulation ablation of the endometrium with these modifications were compared with the first 18 patients who had laser coagulation ablation using standard technique and preoperative endometrial suppression. Compared with the laser method, the modified coagulation method resulted in a comparable rate of satisfactory bleeding decrease at 6 months (90 versus 94%), but involved a clinically significant reduction in total anesthesia time (66.8 versus 117.3 minutes) and volume of irrigation fluid used (5.7 versus 15.9 L).\r"

Forty patients were enrolled in this study. All biopsies were performed in the office without anesthesia. The patients had a median age of 62 years (range 40-83). Discomfort was reported by the patient as mild, moderate, or severe; only two patients (5.0%) reported severe pain. There were no complications experienced with endometrial sampling. Thirty-nine of 40 specimens (97.5%) confirmed endometrial carcinoma; therefore, this study yielded a 97.5% sensitivity for the Pipelle endometrial sampling device. Comparing Pipelle and hysterectomy histology for individual patients, the histologic grade was the same in 29 (74.4%), while the Pipelle demonstrated a more advanced degree of differentiation in five (12.8%) and a lesser degree in five (12.8%). There was no residual tumor identified in one hysterectomy specimen (2.5%). Among the 12 patients who had a D&C for diagnostic purposes before referral, the Pipelle biopsy correlated with the D&C histology in ten of 12 (83.3%) and revealed a more advanced grade of tumor in one (8.3%) and a more differentiated grade in one (8.3%). In one patient, the D&C histology was adenocarcinoma grade 1, with the Pipelle demonstrating atypical hyperplasia and the hysterectomy specimen interpreted as endometrial adenocarcinoma in situ. This study demonstrates the Pipelle to be an accurate device for endometrial sampling in patients with endometrial carcinoma.\r"

The main advantage of the combined technique over two separate procedures was that postoperative visual rehabilitation was faster. Equally important was the stability of the refractive result over a long period of time after surgery, as well as the absence of negative effects on the preexisting corneal graft. In spite of the technical complexity of a combined surgical procedure, this approach probably represents the best choice in rare cases such as the ones reported here.\r"

A within-subjects, repeated measures design was used. All patients had functional arterial and pulmonary artery catheters and were ventilated with a Puritan-Bennett 7200 which could immediately deliver a fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 1.0. Six breaths of maintenance FIO2 and hyperinflation without hyperoxygenation caused a fall in tissue oxygen delivery as measured by continuous transcutaneous oximetry (PtcO2). The largest increases in PtcO2 and arterial oxygen tension were seen with hyperoxygenation alone and a combination of hyperoxygenation and hyperinflation. No significant changes were found in hemodynamic (cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance) or oxygen transport variables (oxygen delivery, oxygen extraction, oxygen consumption) 5 minutes postsuctioning. During both hyperinflation protocols, patients experienced dyspnea. It was concluded that three hyperoxygenation breaths before ETS, using a clinically feasible protocol, are adequate in preventing postsuction hypoxemia in young, hemodynamically stable trauma patients. Large volumes of hyperinflation, although found to increase PtcO2, are not advocated because of demonstrated patient discomfort and the possibility of barotrauma.\r"

Effects of catheter insertion alone and catheter insertion with the application of negative pressure on the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and heart rate prior to and following vagal blockade with atropine were examined. Eleven newborn swine less than 24 h of age were randomly exposed to (a) suction catheter insertion alone and (b) suction catheter insertion and the application of suction. Preoperatively, the subjects were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (.05 mL/kg). The ECG in lead II was recorded on a Gould 2600S recorder. Arterial blood (aB) O2 levels were withdrawn 1 min before and at 20 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 3 min following ETS and analyzed on a calibrated Corning 158 semi-automated aB gas machine. There was a significant decline in PaO2 from baseline at 20 s post ETS in both the no suction and suction protocols, p less than .05. The application of suction caused a greater decline in mean PaO2 (41 torr) compared to no suction (13 torr) at 20 s post ETS which was similar in pattern following vagal blockade (suction: 37 torr; no suction: 2 torr). Following the first pass of the catheter, mean heart rate (HR) declined 14 beats per min with suction and 9 beats per min with no suction. The difference was obliterated following the second pass of the catheter. There was no difference in the HR following vagal blockade.\r"

Findings indicated that preadolescent children were significantly less depressed, less anxious, coped in more positive ways, had fewer adjustment problems, and were in better metabolic control than their adolescent counterparts. Age and secondary sexual development were related to psychosocial adaptation and metabolic control of the diabetes. Further, those who coped by avoiding their problems and who were more depressed were the most likely to have problems in both adjustment and metabolic control with 56% of the variance in metabolic control explained by the variables studied. These findings indicate that preadolescents and adolescents cope differently with a chronic illness, and that interventions should be designed to identify and help those with inappropriate coping styles.\r"

Formants and tenseness were important contributors to a linear combination of acoustic measures, derived from discriminant function analysis, which correctly classified 74% of the procedural pain-induced crying specimens. The inability of this linear combination of acoustic measures to identify correctly approximately one-third of the cry specimens suggests that the discrete acoustic differences among the three situationally defined types of crying is not large.\r"

Coping was proposed to mediate the relationships between danger or opportunity and emotional distress. Data were collected on a sample of 131 women receiving treatment for gynecological cancer. Findings support mastery as weakened under conditions of uncertainty and functioning as a situationally specific personality factor. Mastery was a significant mediator of the relationship between uncertainty and the appraisal of danger and opportunity; although the mediation effect for the relationship between uncertainty and danger was stronger. While two coping strategies were found to function as significant mediators between danger or opportunity and emotional distress, the mediation effect was very small.\r"

A large number and a variety of cold- and influenza-related self-care actions were reported. Medication administration was found to be common for colds (79% of subjects) and influenza (95%). Subjects reported more illness-specific preventive behaviors for influenza than for colds. Influenza vaccination behavior was related to experiences with vaccination-associated illness, health state, and talking with physicians about vaccination. Few subjects identified potential hazards associated with influenza or colds.\r"

The mechanism of action seems to be both topical damage to the mucosal barrier and the systemic effect of a reduction in levels of mucosal prostaglandins. Patients especially at risk are the elderly, those with concomitant debilitating disease, those with a history of ulcers, and those taking corticosteroids. Histamine2 blockers are reported to significantly reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer, and misoprostol (Cytotec) has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Prophylaxis with these agents should be considered for high-risk patients who need NSAID therapy to maintain a reasonable life-style.\r"

Wider use of clear diagnostic criteria and symptom checklists, and better knowledge of the clinical features of the 'funny turns' which are not related to transient focal cerebral ischaemia could reduce the present variability in clinical diagnosis of transient ischaemic attacks. More accurate clinical diagnosis contributes to better selection of the most appropriate investigation strategy for each patient. A basic minimum standard of investigation is outlined and perhaps provides a suitable template for audit. Patients with transient ischaemic attacks which are definitely in the carotid distribution may be eligible for entry in trials of carotid endarterectomy. Prudent use of duplex ultrasound studies of the carotid arteries in patients with appropriate symptoms is an effective way to reduce the costs of investigations and their complications (i.e. the number of strokes associated with cerebral angiography). Digital venous subtraction angiography has, by comparison, many disadvantages as a screening tool. Advances in management include: recent statistical overviews which have emphasized the need to consider blood pressure and plasma cholesterol reduction in a large proportion of patients, and the value of long term anti-platelet therapy in reducing the risks of stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death in both males and females. The value of anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and transient ischaemic attacks or minor stroke is being tested in current trials.\r"

  ".W": "The dose of vitamin D3 required to maintain normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in epileptic patients was evaluated in a prospective study. Patients were divided into two groups, comprising 14 institutionalized and 18 non-institutionalized subjects; they were taking carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbitone, alone or in combination. The study was divided into a dose titration stage and a further period of assessment on a fixed dose after attainment of normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Seventeen of the 18 non-institutionalized patients achieved normal levels over a period of 12 months; the remaining patient became normal after 15 months. The dose required to achieve normal levels ranged from 400 to 4000 IU/day; three patients required less than 2400 IU vitamin D3, 12 required 2400 IU and three required greater than 2400 IU. All institutionalized patients achieved normal levels over a period of 12 months; six patients required less than 2400 IU, six required 2400 IU and two required greater than 2400 IU vitamin D3. Raised alkaline phosphatase levels occurred in 11 patients, and reverted to normal in six patients during the initial return of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to normal. During the second 12 months, when patients were taking a fixed dose of vitamin D3, alkaline phosphatase increased in five patients who had achieved normal levels. During this phase normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not maintained in five patients. There was a significant seasonal variation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels institutionalized patients, being highest in June and lowest in December. Our findings show that while there was a wide range in the dose required to achieve normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels--between 400 and 4000 IU/day--78 per cent of patients responded to a dose of 2400 IU/day.\r"

In this study liver DNA from 59 predominantly British patients (four cases with paired biopsies, 6-12 months apart) with different, mostly chronic, liver diseases was analysed by molecular hybridization. All were seronegative for HBsAg and serum hepatitis B virus DNA (dot blot hybridization) and their liver diseases were believed to be unrelated to hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in liver of 11 (18.6 per cent) patients; nine had episomal (3.2 Kb) DNA and eight had higher molecular weight bands suggesting integrated forms. Six patients were also seronegative for anti-HBc. Patients of UK and non-UK origin were equally represented. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in serum of six of nine patients tested using the polymerase chain reaction. The detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in liver and in serum by this assay in a significant proportion of patients with chronic liver disease, hitherto unsuspected of being hepatitis B virus-related, suggests a possible role for this virus in low- as well as high-prevalence countries.\r"

Blood pressure was measured in the patient's home by the same observer at two-weekly intervals during an 8-week placebo run-in period, every 4 weeks for a further 12 weeks and at 24, 36 and 52 weeks thereafter. Serum potassium, urate, glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin, total and HDL cholesterol, and apolipoproteins were measured at the end of the placebo period and at 4, 8, 24 and 52 weeks of active treatment. Twelve of the 73 patients had an inadequate antihypertensive response--five on the higher dose and seven on the lower dose. One patient receiving 500 micrograms was withdrawn because of adverse effects. In the remaining 60 patients, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced when compared with pretreatment values in both treatment groups throughout the one year period. The decreases in blood pressure were not significantly different from each other (p greater than 0.65). Three patients on 500 micrograms required potassium supplements. Maximum decreases in the serum potassium of 0.52 mmol/l (500 micrograms dose) and 0.14 mmol/l (125 micrograms dose) were observed at 24 weeks of treatment in the remaining 57 patients. The differences between the two doses at this time were statistically significant (p less than 0.05), as were the increases in serum urate observed at 4, 8 and 24 weeks (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ninety Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier children, aged 2-17 years, positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B virus DNA on at least three occasions in 6 months, were randomized into 3 groups. Thirty children received syrup vitamin B complex as control, 29 received 6 weeks of placebo syrup followed by 16 weeks of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon [intron A (rIFN2b)], 5 x 10(6) u/m2 subcutaneously thrice weekly; and 31 received 6 weeks of syrup prednisone (0.6 mg/kg tailed to 0.2 mg/kg) followed by 16 weeks of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon as above. The placebo/prednisone syrup was given on a double-blind basis. At 24 months of follow-up, persistent loss of hepatitis B virus DNA occurred in none of the children in the control group, in one child receiving recombinant alpha 2b-interferon alone, who also seroconverted to anti-HBe and anti-HBs and in five children receiving interferon with steroid priming (p = 0.0571 compared with controls), with four seroconverting to anti-HBe and one also seroconverting to anti-HBs. A rise of transaminases to above twice the upper limit of normal levels during the first 7 months of follow-up occurred in one subject in the control group, four in the group receiving alpha 2b-interferon alone and nine in the group receiving recombinant alpha 2b-interferon with steroid priming (p = 0.0144 compared with controls). Side effects of the steroid were negligible; those of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon were transient and acceptable. We conclude that 6 weeks of prednisone followed by 16 weeks of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon is of use in inducing persistent loss of hepatitis B virus DNA (16.1 per cent) and e-seroconversion (12.9 per cent) in a proportion of Chinese HBsAg carrier children: the prednisone probably enhances the immunomodulatory effect of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon.\r"

The estimated radiotherapy doses to the hypothalamus and pituitary were 3979 +/- 78 (+/- SD) and 6167 +/- 122 cGy, respectively. Within 2 years of radiotherapy, significant impairment in the secretion of growth hormone, gonadotrophins, corticotrophin and thyrotrophin were evident and 14 per cent of patients developed hyperprolactinaemia. Using life table analysis, the cumulative probability of endocrine dysfunction was estimated to be 62 per cent after 5 years with deficiencies in growth hormone, gonadotrophins, corticotrophin and thyrotrophin found in 63.5, 30.7, 26.7 and 14.9 per cent of patients, respectively. Growth hormone deficiency was the earliest endocrine dysfunction observed. Hyperprolactinaemia was uncommon in the male patients but occurred in five of eight women within 3 years of cranial irradiation. The alterations in gonadotrophin secretion suggest a defect in the pulsatile release of gonadotrophin releasing hormone. Twenty-eight patients developed a hypothalamic pattern of delayed thyrotrophin response to thyrotrophin releasing hormone one year after radiotherapy--four subsequently became hypothyroid. Patients who received radiotherapy for cervical lymph nodes were at greater risk of developing hypothyroidism. Thus, in these patients with no pre-existing disease in the hypothalamic-pituitary region, progressive impairment in hypothalamic pituitary function leading to endocrine dysfunction requiring treatment occurs in 50 per cent of patients 5 years after cranial irradiation. Regular endocrine assessment should be performed in all patients following cranial irradiation.\r"

At this time, we are experiencing a dramatic increase in the risks and costs of pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). An example may be seen in the R&D history of lovastatin. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry continues to lead the world in the discovery and development of important new medicines because it assumes greater financial risk and invests more of its sales dollar in R&D than virtually any other industry. Where such a risk is posed, there must continue to be the potential for profits. Pharmaceutical companies must set responsible prices, must keep price increases down, and must help improve access to important medicines.\r"

After the cloning of the first potassium channel over 3 years ago, recombinant DNA manipulation of potassium channel genes is now leading to a molecular understanding of potassium channel behavior. During the past year, functional domains responsible for channel gating and potassium selectivity have been identified, and detailed structural pictures underlying these functions are beginning to emerge.\r"

  ".U": "91233365\r", 
  ".W": "The fragile X syndrome, a common cause of inherited mental retardation, is characterized by an unusual mode of inheritance. Phenotypic expression has been linked to abnormal cytosine methylation of a single CpG island, at or very near the fragile site. Probes adjacent to this island detected very localized DNA rearrangements that constituted the fragile X mutations, and whose target was a 550-base pair GC-rich fragment. Normal transmitting males had a 150- to 400-base pair insertion that was inherited by their daughters either unchanged, or with small differences in size. Fragile X-positive individuals in the next generation had much larger fragments that differed among siblings and showed a generally heterogeneous pattern indicating somatic mutation. The mutated allele appeared unmethylated in normal transmitting males, methylated only on the inactive X chromosome in their daughters, and totally methylated in most fragile X males. However, some males had a mosaic pattern. Expression of the fragile X syndrome thus appears to result from a two-step mutation as well as a highly localized methylation. Carriers of the fragile X mutation can easily be detected regardless of sex or phenotypic expression, and rare apparent false negatives may result from genetic heterogeneity or misdiagnosis.\r"

The hexa(ethylene glycol)-terminated SAMs are the most effective in resisting protein adsorption. The ability to create interfaces with similar structures and well-defined compositions should make it possible to test hypotheses concerning protein adsorption.\r"

A peptide that contained nine arginines (R9) also bound specifically to TAR, and a mutant Tat protein that contained R9 was fully active for transactivation. In contrast, a peptide that contained nine lysines (K9) bound TAR poorly and the corresponding protein gave only marginal activity. By starting with the K9 mutant and replacing lysine residues with arginines, a single arginine was identified that is required for specific binding and transactivation. Ethylation interference experiments suggest that this arginine contacts two adjacent phosphates at the RNA bulge. Model building suggests that the arginine eta nitrogens and the epsilon nitrogen can form specific networks of hydrogen bonds with adjacent pairs of phosphates and that these arrangements are likely to occur near RNA loops and bulges and not within double-stranded A-form RNA. Thus, arginine side chains may be commonly used to recognize specific RNA structures.\r"

Premature and increased expression of the Wnt-1 protein, achieved by injection of synthetic wnt-1 RNA into fertilized Xenopus eggs, enhanced gap junctional communication between ventral cells of the developing embryo. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that Wnt proteins activate a receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway and that gap junctional communication can be a target of this pathway. The effects of two Wnt-1-related proteins on gap junctional communication were also investigated: overexpression of Xwnt-8 increased gap junctional coupling in a manner similar to Wnt-1, whereas Xwnt-5A did not. These findings are consistent with the existence of multiple receptors for Wnt proteins.\r"

This range is striking and reflects many factors shown to influence the development and maintenance of obesity, including physical activity, diet, ethnicity, income, education, and genetic susceptibility. Many minority populations have higher prevalences of obesity and, thus, experience its adverse health consequences disproportionately. Research in diverse populations indicates that the relative importance of risk factors for cardiovascular disease varies in many populations. Data characterizing the profile of risk factors, including obesity and physical activity, for various special populations are limited and some, such as obesity, are based on standards developed in the general population. For public health policy and interventions to succeed, they must address the needs of special populations and of the overall population. This paper discusses some of the relevant broader social and research issues.\r"

This higher incidence of obesity in blacks was largely due to their higher average BMI at baseline. The incidence of major weight gain was 50% higher in blacks than in whites (in blacks, 17.3%; 95% CI = 13.6-21.0; in whites, 11.7%; 95% CI = 10.3-13.1).

Young adults have had the highest BMIs and there have been modest increases in age- and sex-specific mean BMIs for the past 25 y. These observations suggest that the older adults have had less exposure to factors leading to obesity than have the younger adults. Compared with children studied early in this century, present-day Pima children are much heavier for height, suggesting that the degree of obesity has increased since that time. Obesity in the Pimas is familial and has complex relationships with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a common disease in this population. Obesity predicts the development of diabetes; once people have diabetes, however, they tend to lose weight. Thus, obesity should not be studied in this population without also considering diabetes, which tends to limit the degree of obesity.\r"

Among the factors measured were height, weight, skinfold thicknesses, and 24-h dietary recall. The mean body mass index (BMI) was substantially lower for Japanese men in Japan than for Japanese men in California or Hawaii for each 5-y age group. Mean BMIs in Hawaii and California were similar. Values for subscapular skinfold thickness were also lower in Japan than in Hawaii or California in all age groups. Although total caloric intake was not greatly different between Japan and Hawaii, the percent caloric intake as fat was two times greater in Hawaii. Thus, these largely first- and second-generation immigrants exhibit increases in body weight that could be expected to significantly affect cardiovascular risk factor levels and endpoints.\r"

The focus of the paper is on the genetic determinants and the nongenetic correlates of the first type, which is commonly defined as excess weight-for-height or excess body fat without a particular concentration of fat in a given area of the body. The heritability of fat mass or percent body fat derived from underwater-weighing assessment of body density reaches approximately 25% of the age- and gender-adjusted phenotypic variance. The within-identical-twin-pair resemblance in the response to a standardized overfeeding protocol emphasizes the importance of the genotype in determining individual differences in body weight and body composition. In this regard, the proneness to store energy primarily as fat or as lean tissue is a major determinant of the response to a caloric surplus.\r"

Insulin concentrations, insulin binding, insulin action on glucose disposal, fatty acid metabolism, and islet function were compared in lean and obese individuals, and the relationship between insulin resistance and muscle morphology was explored. To explore potential abnormalities in energy balance, calorie intake and gastric emptying were compared in lean and obese Pimas and measurements of energy expenditure were performed. The data suggest that there are multiple metabolic differences that accompany obesity in Native Americans. A lower metabolic rate was a determinant of future weight gain, and abnormalities in use of free fatty acids and cell insulin action were suggested, which emphasize the need for further studies in these areas.\r"

Massive adiposity and high prevalence of obesity characterizes modernizing adult Samoans. Mean body mass index (in kg/m2) at ages 25-54 y is 30-32 for males and 32-36 for females. Prevalence of overweight in female adults is 46% in traditional Western Samoans and 80% in migrants in Hawaii. Five-year longitudinal data show striking weight and fat gain, especially in younger adults and females. An evolutionary perspective on Polynesian adiposity is based on scenarios of the fates of sailors on the voyages of discovery and of settlers in the pioneer island villages. Efficient metabolisms producing rapid adipose-tissue growth could have increased survival among the first Polynesians. Rapid dietary and physical activity changes caused by modernization interacting with such population genetic predispositions may lead to the documented massive adiposity.\r"

Risks include hypertension, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and, in some studies, high total-and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. There is an increased mortality from endometrial cancer in women and from colorectal cancer in men. Chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia, sleep apnea, gout, and degenerative joint disease can occur with more severe obesity. The distribution of body fat is directly related to these health risks. Abdominal obesity is more dangerous than gluteal-femoral obesity because the amount of intraabdominal fat seems to determine much of the increased peril; therefore, risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes increase with abdominal obesity, even independently of total fat mass.\r"

The strength of these associations, for the most part, was similar in blacks and whites. However, with each unit increase in sum of skinfold thicknesses, plasma triglyceride concentrations in blacks appeared to increase only one-third to one-half as much as in whites. Prevalence of cardiovascular disease in 45- to 65-y-old blacks was associated with obesity; the odds ratio (95% confidence interval), adjusted for age and cigarette smoking, was 1.3 (0.9, 1.8) in both black men and black women. Additional analyses showed that abdominal adiposity conferred increased risk. These findings suggest that both blacks and whites should avoid excess adiposity.\r"

The relationship of measures of body fatness to the 20-y follow-up for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke of these men was explored. Body mass index (BMI), subscapular skinfold thicknesses, and centrality index (subscapular skinfold thickness/triceps skinfold thickness) were predictors of CHD in this population, even after other risk factors were added to a multivariate model, indicating an independent contribution of body fat to CHD risk. Neither BMI nor centrality index was related to stroke. However, subscapular skinfold thickness was an independent predictor of stroke. The implications of these findings are that lifestyle changes that lead to an increase in obesity of Japanese men in Hawaii may increase risk for cardiovascular disease.\r"

Inequities in access to health education, treatment services, and environmental opportunities are probably responsible for the exacerbation of obesity and its attendant health conditions in some minority groups. Programs for the prevention of obesity in minority populations need to address these inequities and also to consider ways to counteract the historical trends in the United States toward nutritional excess in the population as a whole.\r"

The Zuni Diabetes Project was initiated in July 1983 to reduce rates of obesity and provide primary and secondary prevention of NIDDM. Two studies of the project's activities have been carried out to date. After 2 y of follow-up, diabetic participants in an exercise program compared with diabetic nonparticipants experienced weight loss, a drop in fasting blood glucose values, and reductions in the use of hypoglycemic medications. In a weight-loss competition, 45% (122/271) of the enrollees finished and lost greater than or equal to 2.3 kg. The results of these two studies demonstrate that 1) participation in a community-based exercise program can produce significant weight loss and improvement in glycemic control in Zuni Indians with NIDDM and 2) weight-loss competitions appear to be an important public health model for health-behavior change in communities similar to that of Zuni, NM.\r"

Additional signs of infection, such as elevated temperature, palpable adnexal complex, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or c-reactive protein, and positive tests for either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis will improve the overall specificity of the clinical diagnosis. Endometrial biopsy offers an acceptable approach to documenting objectively inflammation of the upper genital tract. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered in all patients but may be especially helpful for those patients in whom a diagnosis is unclear. A laparoscopic grading system based primarily on tubal mobility and inflammation can be useful in predicting duration of in-hospital therapy and future tubal factor infertility.\r"

  ".W": "The use of newer broad-spectrum antimicrobials for prophylaxis and treatment in obstetric and gynecologic surgery can reduce patient morbidity and hospital costs. For prophylaxis, a single dose of a cephalosporin with a long elimination half-life can be as effective as a more prolonged course. Single-dose prophylaxis reduces not only toxicity and cost to the patient but also the likelihood of colonization of the vagina by resistant organisms. Treatment regimens for postoperative pelvic infections should have broad-spectrum coverage against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens to ensure high cure rates and prevent subsequent abscess formation. With the introduction of newer cephalosporins and penicillin combinations that include a beta-lactamase inhibitor, it is now possible to treat these polymicrobial infections effectively with monotherapy. Compared with traditional antibiotic combinations, these drugs can reduce side effects and the costs of drug administration as well as the need for therapeutic monitoring. The use of oral antibiotics to complete a course of treatment can also help decrease the high costs of parenteral antibiotic therapy and hospitalization.\r"

Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90% of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were 4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates of Escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of Bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of Proteus mirabilis 0.25 and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of Lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. In summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. Anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.\r"

  ".U": "91233964\r", 
  ".W": "Urinary tract infections are among the most common bacterial infections. To provide appropriate and cost-effective treatment, physicians need to stratify patients with urinary complaints into uncomplicated or complicated categories. This can be accomplished by the history, presenting symptoms, risk factors, and physical examination. Complicated urinary tract infections occur in patients with a history of recurrent infections, signs or symptoms of upper tract disease, or coexisting conditions such as pregnancy, immunosuppression, or structural anomalies of the urinary tract. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in otherwise healthy women who have a history of lower tract symptoms of short duration. Symptoms of urinary tract infection include some combination of dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria, and suprapubic pain. An uncomplicated urinary tract infection is not accompanied by fever or flank pain. The microbiology of uncomplicated urinary tract infection is predictable, with Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus causing more than 90% of urinary tract infections. A history, brief physical examination, and urinalysis are all that is necessary to diagnose a urinary tract infection. Some of the specialized dipsticks and rapid screens are as accurate as microscopic examination in detecting urine white cells. A presumptive diagnosis can be made when a patient has clinical symptoms and some combination of pyuria, hematuria, or bacteriuria. Urine cultures are unnecessary in uncomplicated urinary tract infections and add substantially to the cost of therapy. Pitfalls in the diagnosis include other entities causing dysuria, such as vaginitis, vulvar lesions, physical or chemical irritants, and sexually transmitted diseases. Appropriate therapy requires selection of a drug and determination of the length of treatment. A minor infection should be treated with easy, safe, cost-effective therapy. For urinary tract infections, there are too many antibiotic options, ranging from a single, parenteral dose to a 14-day course of oral medication. Early optimism about single-dose oral therapy has been replaced by evidence suggesting that 3 days of therapy is probably the best. This will eradicate simple urinary tract infections in virtually all patients and decrease the incidence of relapse, whereas patients who are treatment failures usually have occult upper tract infection. Drug choices for short-course therapy include representatives from the penicillin, sulfa, and quinolone families. Selection of a specific drug requires consideration of costs, allergies, side effects, and spectrum of activity. A knowledge of local microbial sensitivity profiles and individual patient tolerance is helpful in guiding the clinician to the appropriate therapeutic regimen.\r"

Thirty-eight women (53%) had Neisseria gonorrhoeae from their pretreatment endocervical or endometrial cultures, and 18 had Chlamydia trachomatis (25%). Thirty-five of 37 women (95%) treated with the ofloxacin regimen were clinically cured, and 34 of 35 (97%) were cured with the cefoxitin-doxycycline regimen (p = 0.52). One clinical failure occurred in each group with N. gonorrhoeae infection, and one failure occurred in the ofloxacin group because of side effects. The bacteriologic response for N. gonorrhoeae in both groups was 100%. The eradication of C. trachomatis was 100% (10/10) for the cefoxitin/doxycycline group and 86% (6/7) for ofloxacin. The side effects were similar in both groups of subjects. In this study both regimens were effective for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute salpingitis.\r"

Some of the common causes of sexually transmitted disease include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and in some patients Ureaplasma urealyticum. N. gonorrhoeae has become more resistant to traditional therapies including penicillin. Resistance to penicillin is mediated by the elaboration of beta-lactamase for most organisms and by chromosomal resistance in others. Resistance to tetracycline and spectinomycin has been clearly identified, as has an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentrations to some cephalosporins. Because of the potential for concomitant infection with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, many patients are currently treated with a combination of a single dose of ceftriaxone plus a tetracycline for 7 days. Therefore it is significant that a single agent, ofloxacin, has been introduced recently for the treatment of such mixed infections. It also has the potential for treating N. gonorrhoeae resistant to other drugs.\r"

Extrahepatic bile duct injury occurred in 4 patients, portal vein injury in 14, and hepatic artery injury in 7; 3 patients had combined injuries. Eleven patients (52%) died, all due to uncontrolled hemorrhage from either an injured portal vein or associated intra-abdominal injuries. Management of the bile duct injuries included drainage alone, bile duct ligation, and Roux-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Survivors of portal vein injury were managed with lateral venorrhaphy. Ligation of the hepatic artery appeared to be optimal for injuries incurred by this vessel. Complications necessitating reoperation or percutaneous drainage procedures were encountered in 8 of 10 surviving patients (80%). Injuries to the portal triad are uncommon, difficult to diagnose, and technically challenging. Mortality is most directly related to uncontrolled intraabdominal hemorrhage, and salvage requires rapid control of bleeding as the first treatment priority.\r"

We report a new technique utilizing anterior sternal retraction that allows division of adhesions between the undersurface of the sternum and the heart and great vessels under direct vision. This technique enables the surgeon to minimize the risk of serious injury to these underlying structures during reoperative cardiac surgery.\r"

The average increase in chest tube output following streptokinase injections was 158%. No significant adverse reactions occurred. One patient required thoracotomy when streptokinase therapy failed. Two others had successful resolution of their pleural collections but required thoracotomy for other indications. There were two deaths (14%), which were unrelated to the use of streptokinase or residual empyema. Intrapleural streptokinase is a safe, effective means of removing retained proteinaceous collections in the pleural space. It is a useful adjunct to chest tube drainage and may obviate the need for more invasive procedures.\r"

  ".W": "Mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation has been reported to have more favorable early and late results than mitral valve replacement. From July 1985 through July 1990, 63 patients have undergone valve repair at Good Samaritan Hospital. Twenty-two men and 41 women whose ages ranged from 34 to 81 years (mean 67.9 years) were treated. Twenty-eight patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. Twelve (19%) had undergone prior cardiac surgery. Isolated valve repair was performed in 18 patients. Valve repair was combined with coronary artery bypass grafting, other valve procedures, or aneurysm resection in the remainder (71%). Two patients (3%) died while in the hospital, and four deaths (one valve-related) occurred after discharge. Leaflet resection for ruptured chordae was done in 24 patients (38%), chordal shortening in 5 patients (8%), and leaflet transposition in 2 patients. Rigid ring annuloplasty (Carpentier) was performed in 62 patients. Eight patients required mitral valve replacement at the same operation because of unsatisfactory valve repair. Results of valve repair evaluated by echocardiography at discharge show that 48 patients (88%) are free of significant regurgitation. Follow-up to date reveals that all surviving patients who underwent valve repair have clinically improved and are stable. Four of five patients with moderate mitral regurgitation are currently asymptomatic. There have been two valve-related late failures requiring reoperation. Based on this early experience, we conclude that valve repair compared with mitral valve replacement has a low operative mortality with good early results. Continued efforts to preserve native mitral valve function in the presence of mitral regurgitation appear justified.\r"

Patients with thyroid adenomas were compared to patients with follicular cancer using the chi-square test and Student's t-test. Statistically significant parameters that distinguished patients at risk of having a thyroid cancer (p less than 0.05) included age greater than 50 years, nodule size greater than 3 cm, and a history of neck irradiation. Sex, family history of goiter or neoplasm, alcohol and tobacco use, and use of exogenous estrogen were not significant parameters. Patients can be identified preoperatively to be at an increased risk of having a follicular cancer and accordingly appropriate surgical resection can be planned.\r"

There were 57 cortical adenomas, 35 pheochromocytomas, 15 carcinomas, 8 cases of cortical hyperplasia, and 6 miscellaneous tumors. The mean time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis of those patients presenting with an identifiable syndrome was 48.3 months. Those with a hypertensive syndrome presented significantly later than those with Cushing's syndrome (57.7 months versus 22.8 months, p less than 0.01). There was a significant delay in diagnosis in those patients with hypertension on the basis of an aldosteronoma as compared with those with hypertension secondary to a pheochromocytoma (75.4 months versus 36.1 months, p = 0.02). Cortical carcinomas were significantly larger than benign cortical tumors (12.7 cm versus 5.5 cm). No malignant neoplasm measured less than 5 cm in diameter. Diagnostic sensitivity for intravenous pyelogram (IVP) was 59%, for ultrasound 71%, for venography 50%, for meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIGB) (pheochromocytoma only) 80%, and for angiography 70%. However, for those patients with adrenal carcinomas, angiography was positive in 100% of cases. Computed tomography (CT) was the most sensitive localizing investigation with a sensitivity of 98%. While other localizing techniques were less sensitive than CT, they may still play a useful role in selected situations. Factors causing delay in diagnosis and the role of the various imaging modalities are discussed.\r"

These results were also separated on the basis of estrogen receptor proteins and of combined aneuploidy with elevated S-phase from flow cytometry. Invasive breast cancer yielded a positive label for Her-2/neu protein (26%) and for epidermal growth factor receptor (25%), with no significant difference. Correlations with estrogen receptor labeling yielded differences significant inversely for both Her-2/neu protein (p less than 0.02) and epidermal growth factor receptor (p less than 0.01). Positive Her-2/neu protein labels correlated with a positive combination of aneuploidy and elevated S-phase (37%) and a negative combination of aneuploidy and elevated S-phase (21%), with a statistically nonsignificant difference. Positive epidermal growth factor receptor cases with aneuploidy and an elevated S-phase (75%) and without aneuploidy and elevated S-phase (42%) did differ with significance at p less than 0.05. There were eight cases positive for both Her-2/neu protein and epidermal growth factor receptor, four of six cases with negative estrogen receptor, four of six cases with negative estrogen receptor, six of six cases aneuploid, and five of six cases with an elevated S-phase. All eight cases had threatening disease--either stage III or stage IV, with one case of extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (comedo). Correlation of negative Her-2/neu protein with negative epidermal growth factor receptor was significant (p less than 0.05) in 74 cases. However, positive Her-2/neu protein did not correlate with positive epidermal growth factor receptor; there was a trend toward inverse correlation. We conclude that epidermal growth factor receptor labeling results show similarities to Her-2/neu protein results, but epidermal growth factor receptor tended to correlate with unfavorable ploidy and S-phase. Epidermal growth factor receptor labeling might be useful in breast cancers with macrocysts reported to show high epidermal growth factor activity.\r"

In order to determine the safety of TAD with respect to wound complications and to identify potential risk factors, we reviewed the charts of 560 patients undergoing MRM (n = 387) and TAD (n = 173) at Virginia Mason Medical Center from 1983 through 1989. The incidence of infection, seroma, hematoma, and epidermolysis were compared, and obesity, age 60 years or older, smoking, antibiotics, and wound drainage were examined as possible risk factors. There were more wound complications in the MRM group versus the TAD group (49% versus 35%; p less than 0.01), specifically more seromas (29% versus 18%; p less than 0.01) and epidermolysis (18% versus 0%). In the MRM group, age 60 years or older was associated with seroma (p less than 0.01) and smoking was associated with epidermolysis (p less than 0.01). In the TAD group, obesity was associated with infection. In both groups, volume of drainage from closed suction wound drains greater than 30 mL in the 24 hours prior to removal of the last drain was associated with seroma (p less than 0.05).\r"

The two groups were matched for age, abscess location, and etiology. Parametric statistical evaluations included the Student's t test as well as analysis of variance; nonparametric statistics used were chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sums. No significant difference was found in mortality (surgical 14% versus percutaneous 12%) or morbidity (surgical 26% versus percutaneous 29%). The duration of hospital stay was similar. Although there was no significant difference between the two groups in severity of illness as measured by APACHE II scores, these scores were significant in determining prognosis. APACHE II scores were significantly higher in non-survivors of both groups (23 versus 13) and also higher in those developing complications. A subgroup of patients with diverticular abscess was identified in whom percutaneous drainage enabled later resection with primary anastomosis without complication. This study indicates that percutaneous drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess is as efficacious as surgical drainage and that APACHE II scores are prognostic of both potential mortality and morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy regarding the management of inguinal hernias in young infants stimulated this study. It was our hypothesis that inguinal hernia in young infants can and should be repaired at the time of presentation. In order to address this issue, the following questions were examined: How frequently are these hernias incarcerated and how should this be managed? What is the best timing of repair? Should the asymptomatic contralateral groin be explored? How do the recurrence and complication rates compare with those in older children? Have advances in anesthesia affected the treatment of these infants? The records of 384 infants less than 2 months of age who underwent inguinal herniorrhaphy from January 1985 to January 1990 at Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle were reviewed. Nearly one fourth (24%) of the patients had incarcerated hernias. Preoperative reduction was successful 96% of the time. The hernia was then repaired within 48 hours. Six patients required urgent operation, but bowel resection was not necessary in any. Contralateral groin exploration was performed 96% of the time and was positive in 85%. The recurrence rate was 1.0%. Complications occurred in 2.3% of patients. There were no hernia-related deaths. Spinal anesthesia was used in 63 patients with no postoperative apnea. An aggressive approach toward prompt repair of hernias in this age group can result in a very low incidence of hernia-related complications. Repair can be carried out safely in the first 2 months of life with recurrence and complication rates comparable with those in older children. Spinal anesthesia may lower the rate of postoperative apnea.\r"

To define subgroups of patients with PFC who would benefit from the new modalities, we reviewed a period (1977 to 1990) during which both surgical and nonsurgical invasive techniques were available. Patients with phlegmon or necrosis at initial diagnosis were excluded. Sixty-five patients (35 male, 30 female) underwent 1 or more drainage procedures. A mean postprocedure follow-up of 10.2 months was available for 59 patients. Initial management was nonsurgical in 80% of patients. Procedures in patients with follow-up comprised invasive nonsurgical drainage (n = 25), invasive nonsurgical drainage plus surgery (n = 22), and surgery only (n = 12). Results for each group, respectively, were: morbidity, 20%, 20%, and 24%; mortality, 8%, 5%, and 0%; and successful drainage, 92%, 82%, and 83%. The choice of management appeared to be based on etiology and radiologic characteristics. Patients with nonalcohol- and nonbiliary-associated pancreatitis without a radiographically defined wall were more common in the invasive nonsurgical group and were successfully treated without surgery. Nonsurgical invasive techniques are efficacious in the treatment of PFC in this subgroup of patients.\r"

Thirty-four percent of patients were veterans. The recipient operation lasted a mean of 7.4 hours (range: 4 to 16 hours). Veno-venous bypass was used routinely at first but selectively later (7 of the last 26 cases), resulting in reduced operating time. Hepatic artery reconstruction was end-to-end anastomosis in 52 cases and iliac conduit in 2. No arterial thrombosis occurred. Biliary reconstruction was choledochocholedochostomy in 83% and choledochojejunostomy in 17%. Biliary complications occurred in 28%. Operative mortality was 2%, and 1-year actual survival was 80%. Patients with hepatitis B fared worse, with four of six dying at a mean of 7.6 months. Overall, the median hospital stay was 30 days. Patients surviving more than 3 months had a mean Karnofsky score of 82%. No significant difference in outcome was noted in patients receiving prophylactic OKT3 monoclonal antibody (used in 45%) versus conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Overall, allograft rejection occurred in 55% of patients. Retransplantation was required in seven patients, three for primary graft nonfunction, two for uncontrolled rejection during induction therapy with OKT3, and two for graft failure secondary to recurrent hepatitis B.\r"

The median age was 27 years, with a range from 1 month to 90 years. Seventy-eight percent of patients presented with abdominal pain, and 35% were jaundiced. Three patients presented with cholangitis, two with cyst rupture, and one with recurrent pancreatitis. Nine patients had had previous biliary surgery. The diagnosis was made in all patients with ultrasound and/or cholangiography. Fifteen patients (65%) had type I cysts, 2 had a type II cyst, 5 (22%) had type III cysts, and 1 had a type IV cyst. Stones were present in four (17%) cysts, and all excised cysts were benign. Seventeen patients with type I and II choledochal cysts had complete cyst excision and choledochoenterostomy. Four of five patients with type III cysts had endoscopic cyst incision and drainage, while the fifth patient had transduodenal cyst excision and sphincteroplasty. The patient with a type IV cyst had extrahepatic cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy. There were no operative deaths. Two postoperative complications occurred: cholangitis and a prolonged ileus. All patients had resolution of their pain and jaundice. Two patients had late cholangitis. Cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy are the treatment of choice for types I and II choledochal cysts. Extrahepatic cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy may be adequate treatment for type IV cysts. Endoscopic incision and drainage is appropriate for selected patients with type III cysts.\r"

Of these, 137 patients (56%) underwent CEA for asymptomatic disease, 52 (37%) of whom had stenotic lesions of 79% or less. There were 6 deaths (3%) and 12 strokes (5%). Four strokes were in asymptomatic patients. These data prompted development of criteria for CEA: (1) hemisphere-specific transient ischemic attacks, reversible ischemic neurologic deficits, or amaurosis fugax with an appropriate carotid lesion; (2) completed stroke with major recovery and significant carotid stenosis; (3) asymptomatic lesion with greater than 80% stenosis (D+) either by carotid arteriogram or non-invasive lab evaluation; and (4) other indications only with a supporting second opinion from a disinterested vascular surgeon, neurosurgeon or neurologist. A prospective review followed institution of the guidelines. In 21 months, 148 operations were performed, a 36% reduction over the initial study period. Of these, 46 (31%) were for asymptomatic lesions. Two patients (4%) did not fulfill the guideline criteria. There were six strokes (4%) and no deaths. The reduction of CEAs appears to be related to a significant decrease in \"inappropriate\" operations being performed. Surgeons' familiarity with the data rather than external pressures seems to be the major factor in changing practice patterns. The decrease in stroke/death rate is not statistically significant.\r"

Duplex scan results agreed with the classification of stenosis by arteriography in 87% of evaluated sides and were within one category in 98%. In 87% of the cases reviewed, the clinical presentation and duplex scan findings were sufficient for appropriate patient management. In the instances that arteriography was useful (13%), the need for arteriography was evident when the duplex scan (1) was technically inadequate or equivocal; (2) showed an unusual distribution of disease, atypical anatomy, or a recurrent lesion; or (3) demonstrated an internal carotid artery with diameter-reducing stenosis of less than 50% in a patient with hemispheric neurologic symptoms despite antiplatelet therapy.\r"

Eighty five patients were studied, 30 diagnosed before and 55 after 1980. The group diagnosed after 1980 showed an 18% improvement in relapse free survival at five years. Their median total dose of 6-mercaptopurine had increased by 22%, whereas according to the protocol it should have risen by an average of only 9%. After 1980 boys were prescribed significantly more 6-mercaptopurine than girls, and had fewer dose reductions because of myelosuppression. These findings support the clinical impression that after 1980 an important therapeutic difference resulting from the new United Kingdom acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocols was an increase in the amount of 6-mercaptopurine that children actually received as a result of changes in prescribing guidelines rather than dose. They also provide further evidence that boys tolerate 6-mercaptopurine better than girls, which may be related to the still unexplained difference in prognosis between the sexes.\r"

Respiratory function was assessed by measurement of thoracic gas volume, airways resistance (from which specific conductance was calculated), and functional residual capacity. To determine the effect of the duration of neonatal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) on respiratory function, the infants' results were divided into three groups: group A, no IPPV; group B, IPPV for less than seven days; and group C, IPPV for more than seven days. Measurements of thoracic gas volume and functional residual capacity were similar to published reference ranges and there were no significant differences between the three groups. Measurements of airways resistance and specific conductance were higher than published reference ranges (mean airways resistance of group A, 34 cm H2O/l/sec; B, 34.1 cm H2O/l/sec, and C, 30.4 cm H2O/l/sec) but there was no significant difference between the three groups. The 95% confidence intervals of the difference of the means between groups A and B were -6.94 to 6.73 cm H2O/l/sec and between groups A and C -3.8 to 11.0 cm H2O/l/sec. Our results suggest that factors other than neonatal ventilation may be more important in the pathogenesis of chronic lung function abnormalities in preterm infants.\r"

A total of 122 babies whose notes were available for review, with a median gestational age of 27 weeks (range 23-35) and median birth weight of 960 g (range 470-2750), were transported distances of up to 80 miles. The median ages at ligation with and without previous medical management with indomethacin were 23 and 15 days, respectively. One hundred and ten (90%) babies were dependent on ventilatory support, but extubation was achieved at a median time of 10 days after ligation, regardless of postnatal age at the time of ligation. There were no deaths associated with the operation, and no complications resulting from transportation. The hospital mortality was 15 (12.3%), and the most important (and significant) adverse factor was a preoperative fractional inspiratory oxygen content greater than 0.3. The results of this study show that day case ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus is safe, and if it is carried out early will reduce the time before extubation and discharge from the intensive care unit.\r"

Complications were transient respiratory arrest (n = 2), hypoxia (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2), and laryngospasm (n = 1). All complications were followed by complete recovery. Our results suggest that flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy is safe. Advantages over rigid bronchoscopy include greater visual range, fewer complications, and the avoidance of a general anaesthetic.

Children with maculopapular rashes had significantly higher platelet counts (median 294 compared with 243 x 10(9)/l), and plasma total haemolytic complement activity (80.5 compared with 65.0 U/ml) and significantly lower Glasgow meningococcal septicaemia prognostic scores (2.5 compared with 5.5) than those with purpuric rashes on admission. There were no significant differences between the groups in mortality, white cell count or absolute neutrophil count on admission, or C reactive protein concentration. Meningococcal disease can present with a maculopapular rash alone but this does not necessarily mean that the disease is less severe.\r"

Stool energy losses were equivalent to 3.5% of gross energy intake in healthy children (range 1.3-5.8%). Despite a comparable gross energy intake, stool energy losses were three times greater in patients with cystic fibrosis than controls averaging 10.6% of gross energy intake (range 4.9-19.7%). Stool lipid could account for only 29% and 41% of the energy within the stool in controls and patients with cystic fibrosis respectively and was poorly related to stool energy. Approximately 30% of the energy within the stool could be attributable to colonic bacteria in both the healthy children and patients with cystic fibrosis. These results suggest that stool energy losses in healthy children are relatively modest but that even when patients with cystic fibrosis are symptomatically well controlled on pancreatic enzyme replacement, raised stool energy losses may continue to contribute towards an energy deficit sufficient to limit growth in cystic fibrosis. As the energy content per gram wet weight remains relatively constant (8 kJ/g), stool energy losses may be estimated from simple measurements of stool wet weight.\r"

When compared with a sample of children being treated by hospital haemodialysis, children who had received transplants had more favourable parental views of behavioural and emotional adjustment, better parental psychiatric adjustment, and indications of superior child rated mood, self concept, and social functioning. Children who had received transplants did, however, show an increase in minor behavioural symptoms compared with healthy controls, and most parents required continuing psychological and social support as well as attention to physical aspects of the child's condition. Kidney transplantation is associated with improved psychosocial behaviour in children, but there is a continuing need for support for parents in dealing with minor psychological problems after the transplant.\r"

Analysis of the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) gene from clinical isolates revealed that resistance was due to multiple nucleotide changes conferring specific amino acid substitutions in this enzyme. In order to correlate the degree of resistance with these amino acid changes, we constructed a series of infectious HIV variants with specific combinations of mutations in the RT gene and assessed their sensitivity to zidovudine. The reproducible nature of the mutations seen in clinical isolates has enabled the polymerase chain reaction to be used to identify lesions associated with resistance. This procedure was validated by analysis of sensitive and resistant clinical isolates with RT genes of known DNA sequence. Using a 'double' amplification procedure, zidovudine sensitivity was assessed by direct detection of specific mutations in DNA from peripheral-blood lymphocyte samples. This should make it possible to test large numbers of individuals receiving zidovudine therapy, with the aim of establishing the clinical significance of the resistant isolates.\r"

  ".W": "Antisense RNA can inhibit the expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to which they are complementary by a variety of mechanisms and might provide the basis for antiviral therapies of high selectivity. In a previous study of six retrovirally expressed antisense RNAs targeted to HIV-1IIIB, we found that two significantly reduced HIV-1IIIB replication. Here we test the degree to which this inhibitory effect tolerates the natural variation found in the nucleotide sequence of different strains of HIV-1. We show that the longer of the two inhibitory antisense RNAs (600 bases) inhibits replication of HIV strains RF, MN and SF2 to at least as great an extent as it does the homologous strain. In contrast, the shorter (71 bases) does not inhibit replication of the heterologous strains. An examination of the predicted positions of the mismatches in the duplexes formed between the IIIB antisense RNAs and the mRNAs of heterologous strains suggests that one requirement of an inhibitory antisense RNA is that it can form a perfect duplex with its target mRNA of at least some 51-64 base-pairs. Although the observations presented here are not definitive proof of this, they are reminiscent of the structural requirements deduced for the double-stranded RNA-mediated induction of interferon and the activation of interferon-induced 2', 5'-oligo(A) synthetase and protein kinase. We tested the ability of antisense RNA to inhibit HIV replication in Jurkat, CEM, U937 and HeLa-T4 cells. The level of inhibition of HIV-1IIIB replication varied according to the cell line in which it was expressed, but in all cases was significant.\r"

The empirical model incorporates the following features: (1) within-person and between-person variability in CD4 measurements; (2) variation in the rates of decline of CD4 values; (3) variation in the level of CD4 at which clinical AIDS is diagnosed, and (4) greater absolute variation in CD4 values in men with high CD4 levels compared with men with low CD4 values. Three applications of the model to assist in the design and interpretation of clinical trials are given. Further applications to clinical trials and to estimate the current and future spectrum of HIV-mediated immunological disease in the USA, as measured by the CD4 values, are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "After immunization of chimpanzees against HIV antigens, antibodies that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) were evaluated and compared with anti-HIV-antibody levels detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralizing antibody titers. Adult chimpanzees were immunized with different HIV-1 (LAV-BRU) antigen preparations: recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) expressing gp160, p25 or p27nef; formalin- and beta-propiolactone-inactivated whole virus (inHIV); soluble recombinant gp160 either associated or not associated with other HIV proteins; a 25-mer peptide from the V3 region of gp120 coupled with KLH (V3-KLH). Immunization with the various rVV mixtures induced no or borderline ADCC increase above preimmune serum levels. Stronger and more sustained reactivity was elicited by inHIV. Purified HIV antigens elicited ADCC activity when the chimpanzees were naive; ADCC increased or remained at the same level when the animals had been preimmunized with rVV and/or inHIV. This type of reactivity apparently did not depend on whether gp160 alone or mixed with other proteins was used for immunization. The injection of V3-KLH resulted in only little, if any, recall ADCC response. ELISA antibody titers significantly correlated with ADCC and neutralizing antibody titers, but serum ADCC was independent of neutralizing antibody titers, an indication that the two latter serum activities are mediated by independent antibodies. Therefore, ADCC is elicited in the same manner as other antibody activities by the immunization of chimpanzees with inHIV or with purified recombinant HIV antigen preparations. The results obtained from the three chimpanzees of this series, which were subsequently challenged with infectious virus through the intravenous route, suggest that serum ADCC may be considered for vaccination purposes.\r"

In order to ascertain the efficacy of interventions aimed at reducing HIV-related risk-taking behaviour among this population, valid and reliable (yet preferably short) instruments for measuring such behaviour are required. The HIV risk-taking behaviour scale (HRBS) is a brief 11-item interviewer-administered scale which examines the behaviour of intravenous drug users in relation to both injecting and sexual behaviour. This paper describes the construction of the scale, in addition to data evaluating its reliability and validity. Initial analyses indicate that the scale has satisfactory psychometric properties.\r"

Of the 80.2% reporting intravenous drug use in the previous year, 78.3% reported sharing needles. Of the 47.7% reporting intravenous use in the previous 30 days, only 40.5% shared needles, with 59.3% sharing with only one other person. Most needle-sharing partners were very well known (63%) or well known (17%) to the subjects. The most frequent method for obtaining needles was 'buying in a drug store', ranked first by 65% of the sample. Subjects whose primary source was 'buying in a drug store' shared equipment less frequently during drug-use events in the previous year (mean: 16.2%) than those with other primary sources (mean: 28.5%). Compared with findings from other regions where needle purchase and possession are illegal without a prescription, fewer subjects in the current investigation shared needles, and those who did shared with a smaller number of people. The apparent association between legalized injection equipment and reduced sharing of equipment among IVDUs should be further examined in longitudinal studies of needle-sharing before and after legalization is instituted.\r"

  ".W": "During the prospective follow-up of 64 babies at risk for perinatal HIV-1 infection because their mothers were seropositive, and of 130 control babies whose mothers were seronegative, we studied the occurrence of complications of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunization and its ability to induce cutaneous reactivity to tuberculin. Babies born both to HIV-1-positive and HIV-1-negative mothers received BCG immunization during their first month of life according to the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) recommendations. Local and regional complications of BCG vaccine were looked for at 3, 6 and 9 months after inoculation. A tuberculin skin test was performed at 6 or 9 months of age. Most babies born to HIV-1-positive mothers were later classified as infected or uninfected according to their clinical condition and/or serological status at 18 months of age. The mean duration of the follow-up was 36 months (range 30-40 months). No chronic or deep ulcerations at the site of injection or disseminated forms of BCG infection were observed. The frequency of BCG-related lymphadenitis in the group of HIV-1-infected children (24%) did not differ significantly from the group of uninfected children (19%; Fisher test: P = 0.73). In contrast, the tuberculin skin test responses were positive less often in the group of HIV-1-infected children (33%) than in the uninfected group (83%; Fisher test: P = 0.007). Because BCG vaccine appears to be safe--even when given to perinatally infected babies--continuation of the BCG immunization policies of the EPI is justified, especially in view of the growing incidence of tuberculosis as a complication of HIV infection.\r"

We review the clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic data in 63 patients (eight new cases and 55 cases reported in the literature) with Mediterranean VL (kala azar) and HIV-1 infection to determine whether VL should be considered an opportunistic infection in HIV-infected adults. We conclude that: (1) in areas where both leishmaniasis and HIV-1 infection are endemic, VL may be more frequent among HIV-infected adults; (2) in HIV-infected patients, the clinical picture did not differ significantly from classical kala azar, although it often ran a recurrent course, with resistance to antimonial therapy. We propose the inclusion of VL in the IVC-2 subgroup of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) clinical classification of HIV-1 infection while prospective and larger studies further define whether there are clinical presentations that could justify adding VL to the list of opportunistic infections indicative of AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Hematopoietic disturbances are common in patients with HIV-1 infection. Recent studies on immune activation markers such as neopterin demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is associated with chronic immune activation. We investigated a possible association between serum neopterin concentrations and blood cell counts (CD4+ T cells, white blood cells, platelets, red blood cells) and hemoglobin and hematocrit in 94 HIV-1-seropositive individuals [52 Walter Reed (WR) stage 1, 31 WR2, one WR5, and 10 WR6]. There were significant negative correlations between neopterin concentrations and CD4+ T cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelets. These correlations were also significant if either only WR1 and WR2 patients or the entire set of data were considered for calculations. Thus, hematological abnormalities are associated with chronic immune activation in patients with HIV-1 infection. Large amounts of neopterin are released by human macrophages on stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) further enhances the effect of IFN gamma. Therefore, our data suggest that activated immune cells and specific cytokines such as IFN gamma and TNF alpha are involved inhibiting hematopoiesis.\r"

In the MHS group, however, muscle pH decreased to 6.45 (0.05) 5 min after exercise before recovering slowly to only 6.64 (0.07) after 30 min (P less than 0.01 compared with control group). There was no difference in muscle temperature, venous pH or venous lactate concentrations between the two groups. The results show that there is abnormal recovery of muscle pH after short-duration, high-intensity exercise in MHS subjects.\r"

We studied 75 patients who received a standard general anaesthetic which included non-depolarizing neuromuscular block; they were allocated randomly to one of the three groups immediately before intubation. The mean time required to effect Berman airway intubation (34.9 s) was similar to that required for tongue traction intubation (35.3 s) and significantly greater than that required for Macintosh intubation (11.7 s). The cardiovascular responses to both types of fibreoptic intubation were significantly greater and more prolonged than those of Macintosh intubation. There were no significant differences between the responses to the two fibreoptic techniques. Haemodynamic effects should be considered when performing fibrescope-guided tracheal intubation under general anaesthesia and, when necessary, appropriate measures should be taken to minimize them.\r"

At delivery (at a mean time of 8.2 min after atracurium 0.3 mg kg-1), the mean UV concentrations were 103 ng ml-1 (range 44-189 ng ml-1) for atracurium, 26 ng ml-1 (range 6-60 ng ml-1) for laudanosine and 59 ng ml-1 (range 21-148 ng ml-1) for monoquaternary alcohol. The ratios of UV:MV, UA:MV and UA:UV blood concentrations were related positively to time since injection of atracurium for all three substances (P less than 0.01 in each instance). The UV:MV ratio at delivery was greatest for laudanosine: mean 19.4% (range 1-35%), compared with 7% (range 2-21%) for atracurium and 10% (range 0-15%) for monoquaternary alcohol. These low values confirm that, although atracurium crosses the placental barrier and its metabolites may be found in the fetus, the drug is safe to use during Caesarean section.\r"

To determine if this effect has a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic origin, 18 ASA physical status I or II adults received atracurium 0.2 mg kg-1, with (n = 10) or without (n = 8) previous injection of suxamethonium 1 mg kg-1, during a thiopentone-nitrous oxide-isoflurane (0.5% end-tidal) anaesthetic. Arterial blood samples were obtained and plasma atracurium concentration measured by HPLC. Train-of-four stimulation was applied to the ulnar nerve and the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle was recorded. Mean (SEM) volume of distribution was slightly greater with previous suxamethonium (143 (13) ml kg-1) than without (109 (5) ml kg-1) (P less than 0.04). Mean elimination half-life was unaffected (20.3 (0.8) min and 20.4 (1.6) min, respectively). Neuromuscular block was more intense and recovery was slower with previous administration of suxamethonium. Atracurium concentration at 50% block (Cpss50) was 305 (30) ng ml-1 with and 454 (25) ng ml-1 without previous suxamethonium (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that suxamethonium may be associated with a slight increase in the volume of distribution of atracurium, but this effect is more than compensated by a decrease in atracurium concentration required for a given effect.\r"

PE' was measured by infra-red analysis and Pa by gas chromatography. Washin of isoflurane occurred at the same rate in the young and elderly, with no significant difference between young and elderly in PE' or Pa as proportions of the inspired partial pressure (PI). After 20 min of isoflurane administration, mean Pa/PI in the young was 0.57 (95% confidence limit (CL) 0.53-0.62) and 0.55 in the elderly (95% CL 0.51-0.59). Washin of halothane was slower in the elderly than in the young, with Pa/PI significantly less in the elderly from 10 min after introduction of halothane. The difference between age groups, however, was small: mean Pa/PI after 20 min of halothane administration 0.45 (95% CL 0.41-0.49) in the young and 0.38 (95% CL 0.35-0.41) in the elderly. Washin of isoflurane was significantly faster than that of halothane in both young and elderly subjects. For isoflurane, the PE'-Pa gradient was small relative to Pa and did not differ significantly between young and elderly. For halothane, PE'-Pa in the young did not differ significantly from that for isoflurane. In the elderly, PE'-Pa for halothane was significantly greater than in the young and than PE'-Pa for isoflurane.\r"

After the test dose of lignocaine with adrenaline, HR increased significantly in both groups at 30 s, 1 and 2 min, and remained increased at 3 min in the atropine group. The maximum increase in HR was greater in the atropine group than in the saline group (31 (4) beat min-1 vs 26 (11) beat min-1 (P less than 0.05). However, when individual maximum HR changes are considered, five patients in the saline group and four in the atropine group had an increase less than or equal to 10 beat min-1, and three patients in the saline group had no change or a decrease in HR. Defining a positive result to a test dose as an increase in HR of greater than 10 beat min-1, the sensitivity of the adrenaline test dose was 83 (5.5)% in the saline group and 91 (3.5)% in the atropine group (ns).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of potential oocyte donors 41% would agree to nonanonymous donation, 12% would wish to meet the recipient couple and although only 4% wanted to choose the recipient, a quarter of the couples would prefer a relative or friend as the recipient. Provision of nonidentifying information about the donor to the recipient couple was acceptable to almost 70% whereas 40% found giving the same information to the child acceptable.\r"

DESIGN--A prospective 3-year observational multi-centre study. SETTING--Gynaecological units in the UK and USA with special interest in endoscopic laser surgery. SUBJECTS--859 women with menorrhagia resistant to medical therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Duration of laser ablation, intra- and post-operative complications, amenorrhoea rate, oligomenorrhoea rate, and woman's subjective assessment of treatment. RESULTS--No major complications occurred in 859 treatments. Four (0.4%) cases of transient fluid overload, 4 (0.4%) of infection, and 3 (0.3%) of uterine perforation occurred. Each of the perforations occurred during insertion of the rigid instruments and none was produced by the laser. There were no major haemorrhages, no blood transfusions were needed, and no woman required a laparotomy. The mean duration of the laser ablation was 24 min, and the average stay in hospital was less than 24 h. Of the 479 women followed up for at least 6 months after treatment 288 (60%) developed complete amenorrhoea and 152 (32%) reported continuing but satisfactorily reduced menstruation; 39 (8%) failed to improve with the first treatment, but 26 of them responded to a second laser ablation. Overall 466 (97%) had a satisfactory response to laser ablation and only 13 (3%) required subsequent hysterectomy. CONCLUSION--Endometrial laser ablation would appear to be a popular, safe, effective and economical alternative to hysterectomy for the treatment of menorrhagia.\r"

Given the absence of relevant community based data, decision analysis techniques were used to address these issues. The results reveal that the estimated cost per case of Rh HDN prevented through postpartum immune globulin prophylaxis is lower than the cost per case of Rh HDN treated through a curative strategy. However, the financial and infrastructural requirements of the preventive programme mean that such prevention may not be feasible at present. With the achievement of the Indian Government's stated objectives of population control, however, disease incidence should fall by 30% from 5.90/1000 births in 1981 to 4.13/1000 births by the year 2000, even in the absence of a prophylaxis programme.\r"

  ".W": "Flow velocity waveforms (FVWs) from the fetal umbilical artery were recorded from 2178 pregnant women over a 6-year period. All of them had an obstetric factor indicating increased risk of fetal compromise. A total of 6749 studies was recorded. The systolic diastolic (AB) ratio was measured and classified as normal (less than 95th centile), elevated (95-99th centile), high (greater than 99th centile) or extreme (absent diastolic flow). The results of these studies have been related to subsequent fetal and neonatal outcome. An abnormal umbilical artery FVW was associated with shorter gestation and infants with lower birthweight, shorter length and lower ponderal index. There was a highly significant association between an abnormal FVW and the birth of an infant small for gestational age. The significance of the association increased with the increased abnormality of the umbilical artery FVW and this was independent of gestational age. Preterm infants associated with high or extreme AB ratios spent twice as long in the neonatal nursery than those with normal AB ratios. Analysis of 794 pregnancies studies serially indicated that an abnormal FVW in which the AB ratio was increasing, in contrast to a decreasing AB ratio, predicted a poor outcome for both size at birth and duration of neonatal intensive care. We conclude that in high risk pregnancy Doppler umbilical artery FVW studies predict the most compromised fetuses in terms of growth retardation and requirements for neonatal intensive care.\r"

Differences were not observed in frequency of recurrence by age at diagnoses or by the site of the myomas at surgery. Patients with a single myoma tended to experience a lower rate, but this finding was not statistically significant. Women who gave birth to a child after myomectomy had a 10-year recurrence rate of 15%, against 30% for those who did not; this difference was statistically significant.\r"

The reviewer's main criticisms were of inadequate fetal heart monitoring, lack of involvement of senior staff and inadequate records. The fetal heart trace was missing in 7 cases and over half of the remaining 34 traces available were misinterpreted or not acted on. In 17 cases junior doctors failed to recognize fetal distress and managed a delivery that they did not have the experience to deal with. In a further 6 cases, senior staff were called but did not come. Records were criticized for being incomplete, illegible or missing. In a few cases unjustified alterations appeared to have been made. Women reported that on some occasions staff ignored their worries, were unsympathetic and gave too little information. Some parents also experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining a clear explanation of the nature and cause of their child's condition.\r"

Before abortion over 60% in both groups had high scores (compatible with psychiatric morbidity), but after the abortion there was a significant and equal fall in scores so that by 1 month less than 10% of either group had high scores. There was no difference between the two groups. Both methods of abortion were acceptable to the majority of women, although only 75% of the medical group indicated they would have the same method if a future termination was ever required, compared with 94% in the surgical group. However, in 13 women who had experience of both methods, the medical approach was preferred by 10 (77%). Thus, medical abortion is acceptable to the majority of women and is associated with the same low rate of short term psychiatric morbidity as has been recorded with surgical methods of termination, despite greater patient involvement and awareness of the abortion process.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the outcome in nearly drowned children in the British Isles and identify factors that might predict a poor prognosis. DESIGN--Study of drowned and of nearly drowned children aged less than or equal to 14. Information on nearly drowned children admitted to hospital obtained from consultant paediatricians returning monthly notification cards through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Information on drowned children obtained from Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and other national epidemiological offices. SETTING--British Isles, 1988 and 1989. SUBJECTS--330 children who had confirmed submersion incidents. 142 died before admission to hospital and 188 children were admitted after nearly drowning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death, full recovery, or degree of handicap after near drowning and signs on admission to hospital. RESULTS--All of the children who were conscious on admission fully recovered. Of the 64 children unconscious on admission, 31 had normally reactive pupils and all but three (all of whom had severe preexisting neurological disease) recovered fully. Of the 33 children with fixed dilated pupils on admission, 10 fully recovered, 13 died, and 10 had severe neurological deficit. Spontaneous respiratory effect on admission was associated with normal survival. Pupils that remained dilated six hours after admission and fits continuing 24 hours after admission predicted a poor outcome. CONCLUSION--Children can survive normally after near drowning in the British Isles, particularly if they have been hypothermic. Resuscitation should not be abandoned in nearly drowned children until they have been rewarmed.\r"

PATIENTS--4 cases in patients (one of Indian parents, one African, one white English, and one Afro-Caribbean) resident in the United Kingdom, who presented with transient epilepsy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Findings on computed tomography and on screening for infections. RESULTS--In all four cases a small mass lesion in one cerebral hemisphere was observed on computed tomography, which resolved after 9, 4, 3 and 1.5 months respectively without surgery. CONCLUSIONS--The number of cases seen in one year suggests that the lesions may be more common in the United Kingdom than previously recognised and that research into their cause is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To develop, test, and validate an algorithm for diagnosing disease in neonates during an over the telephone referral to a specialist cardiac centre. DESIGN--A draft algorithm requiring only data available to a referring paediatrician was generated. This was modified in the light of a retrospective review of case records. A questionnaire to elicit all the data required by the algorithm was then generated. There followed a prospective three phase evaluation during consecutive over the telephone referrals. This consisted of (a) a conventional phase with unstructured referral consultations, (b) a phase with referrals structured around the questionnaire but independent of the algorithm, and (c) a validation phase with the algorithm (and its previous errors) available during the referral consultation. SETTING--59 paediatric centres in south east England and a central specialist paediatric cardiology unit. PATIENTS--Consecutive neonates (aged less than 31 days) referred with suspected heart disease. The retrospective review was of records of 174 neonates from 1979. In the prospective evaluation (1987-90) the conventional phase comprised 71 neonates (over 5.5 months), the structured phase 203 neonates (over 14 months), and the validation phase 195 neonates (over 12 months). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diagnostic accuracy (assigning patients to the correct diagnostic category (out of 27)), of the referring paediatrician, the specialist after the referral consultation, and the algorithm as compared with the definitive diagnosis by echocardiography at the specialist centre, and score for the appropriateness of management in transit. RESULTS--Simply structuring the consultation by questionnaire (that is, proceeding from the conventional phase to the structured phase) improved the diagnostic accuracy of both paediatricians (from 34% (24/71 cases) to 48% (97/203) correct) and specialists (from 54% (38/71 cases) to 64% (130/203) correct). The algorithm (structured phase) would have been even more accurate (78% (158/203 cases); p less than 0.01). Management scores in the structured phase were also better than in the conventional phase (80%(162/203 cases)v 58% (41/71) appropriate; p less than 0.01). Management scores would have improved to 91% appropriate (185/203; p less than 0.001) had the algorithmic diagnoses dictated management. The superiority of the algorithm was maintained but not bettered in the validation phase. CONCLUSIONS--Applying the algorithm should reduce the morbidity and mortality of neonates with critical heart disease by aiding clinicians in therapeutic decisions for in transit care.\r"

A review of the literature indicates that nearly 50% of patients on dialysis for more than 3 years develop renal cystic changes. The major complications of this condition are neoplasia and spontaneous renal haemorrhage. The risk of developing renal carcinoma has been estimated to be more than 30 times higher in dialysis patients with cystic changes than in the general population. Our experience with 5 patients is reported, including 3 with renal tumours and 1 with metastatic disease. Careful surveillance of dialysis patients using yearly ultrasonography and computed tomography is recommended. The evolving indications for radical nephrectomy in this disease are discussed.\r"

The factors studied were the duration of pain prior to presentation, pyuria, haematuria, surface regularity of the stone and the degree of obstruction as seen radiologically. In stones less than or equal to 10 mm in size, conservative treatment was successful when the duration of pain was less than 30 days (39/45), when there was no significant pyuria (53/82), when the stones had an irregular surface (44/65) and when obstruction was only partial (55/88). Since most of these factors were interactive, further statistical analysis showed that duration of pain was the only significant factor in predicting the outcome of conservative treatment. In stones greater than 10 mm in size these factors had no predictive value and only 2/23 were passed spontaneously on conservative treatment.\r"

A significant percentage of patients present in later childhood or adolescence for correction of their residual deformities. We have reconstructed 26 patients, correcting their entire urogenital and cosmetic deformity in a one-stage procedure. The results show that one-stage total reconstruction is possible and is preferable to serial correction of the various individual abnormalities. The principles of surgical reoperation in adolescence are the same as those now established for the primary correction in neonatal life.\r"

A detailed audit of 166 patients cared for in this way is presented and the results compared with those in 25 patients who remained in hospital in the interval between catheterisation and operation and in 402 patients not previously catheterised. Although the mortality rate was significantly higher in the retention group (3.3 vs 0.25%), we feel that this is a reflection of the fitness of the patients with retention rather than a consequence of the management policy. The advantages of the \"catheterise and send home\" policy are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "In the course of a Medical Research Council trial of intravesical chemotherapy, biopsies were taken from apparently normal bladder urothelium near to newly diagnosed superficial bladder cancers in 417 patients. Differences were noted in the rates at which histological features were described in different centres. To gain more information about the reproducibility of the pathological findings, a group of 6 pathologists (5 from the UK and 1 from the USA), all having a special interest in urological pathology, were asked to examine a representative sample of 92 slides. They were then asked to re-examine 30 of them after an interval of at least 6 months. At first examination and at re-examination the slides were assessed using a standard proforma. However, the definitions of the categories were left unspecified for the pathologists to use their own criteria. The 5 UK pathologists then met to establish a consensus view of each slide. The results indicated that: (1) The reporting of non-dysplastic changes varied so much between pathologists as to render it of little value to clinical practice. (2) There were wide variations between different pathologists in the reported incidence of dysplastic change. (3) On a second review the pathologists reproduced their own assessment on only 62% of occasions. (4) Even after discussion between pathologists there was no consensus on the diagnosis of mild as opposed to moderate dysplasia. Consensus was reached on all biopsies which showed either severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ. (5) In adopting a policy of taking urothelial biopsies, urologists should be aware of the imprecision and lack of reproducibility in the interpretation of such biopsies. (6) Biopsies of cystoscopically normal urothelium may not be a useful guide in defining therapy.\r"

The heart rate and stroke volume fell progressively over the first 30 min of surgery, resulting in a steady reduction in cardiac output. There was a significant increase in left ventricular afterload from commencement of the procedure. These findings demonstrate that haemodynamic responses, which are not detectable using conventional methods of monitoring, occur during TURP. Increased left ventricular afterload indicates increased myocardial work and oxygen demand which could result in myocardial ischaemia. This may contribute to the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality which have been reported to occur after TURP. The possible underlying mechanisms are discussed.\r"

In the present study, 6 piglets were cannulated and connected to extracorporeal perfusion apparatus. Pump flows correlated with human ECC values with non-haemic prime were used. The mucosal and submucosal blood circulation in the urethra reduced by 66% during ECC (P less than 0.05). The brain and hepatic arterial flows increased. A significant reduction was seen in renal blood circulation. The changes in the urethral blood circulation during ECC correlated with previous findings. The reduced wash out levels of chemicals leaching from the indwelling latex catheters as a result of reduced local blood circulation are the main trigger for the induction of urethral strictures during ECC and in other shock-like circulatory disturbances in the human body.\r"

Optical urethrotomy under local urethral anaesthesia produces results comparable to those reported by others using general anaesthesia. If large numbers of patients are to be treated, possibly repeatedly, then out-patient urethrotomy may result in more efficient use of resources.\r"

The median follow-up period was 6.7 years. Dilatation and vesicoureteric reflux were assessed by means of repeated urography and voiding cystourethrography. Of the 49 children with normal radiology at the start of catheterisation, all but 2 remained normal. In 27 with isolated dilatation of the upper urinary tract or reflux at the start, 17 subsequently became normal. Dilatation together with reflux was seen in 13 patients at the start; 3 became normal, 4 still had reflux and in 6 patients both dilatation and reflux persisted. Intermittent catheterisation thus had a positive effect on the upper urinary tract in the vast majority of cases. In children with both dilatation and reflux, however, there is a risk of deterioration and they should be followed up closely.\r"
