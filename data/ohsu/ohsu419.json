  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether adaptive changes occur in beta adrenergic-muscarinic cholinergic interactions in the control of cardiac contractility after chronic interruption of the sympathetic input. Attenuation of the contractile response to beta adrenoceptor stimulation by muscarinic agonists was studied in isolated left ventricular papillary muscles from control rats and rats pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) hydrobromide (2 X 50 mg/kg i.v. at 24-h intervals) and killed 3 days to 3 weeks later. Pretreatment with 6-OHDA increased the inotropic sensitivity to isoproterenol, expressed as a left shift of the concentration-response curve, at 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks. However, the inotropic concentration-response curve for isoproterenol was not significantly shifted at 3 weeks. In control tissues, a maximally effective concentration of carbachol produced a 3.8-fold shift of the isoproterenol concentration-response curve to the right. This carbachol-induced right shift was increased to 9.8-, 7.9-, 9.5- and 4.6-fold at 3 days and 1, 2 and 3 weeks, respectively, after 6-OHDA treatment. Additional experiments were performed to examine the concentration-response for muscarinic agonists in attenuating the inotropic response to a maximally effective concentration of isoproterenol. The potency of carbachol was increased 1.8-fold (3 days), 2.7-fold (1 week), 2.8-fold (2 weeks) and 2.3-fold (3 weeks) after 6-OHDA pretreatment. A 2.0-fold increase in the potency of oxotremorine was also observed at 2 weeks. In addition, the maximal effect of both agonists was increased in tissues from 6-OHDA-treated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of oral hypoglycemic sulfonylureas, tolbutamide and glyburide, on metabolic flux through the pyruvate carboxylase reaction was evaluated in liver mitochondria isolated from 24-hr fasted rats. Both these sulfonylureas inhibited the metabolic flux through the pyruvate carboxylase reaction in a concentration dependent manner. Half-maximal inhibition was achieved at tolbutamide and glyburide concentrations of 0.85 mM and 63.3 microM, respectively. Neither sulfonylurea altered the activity of pyruvate carboxylase or the Km of the enzyme for ATP and pyruvate. However, glyburide and tolbutamide decreased mitochondrial ATP content and elevated mitochondrial ADP and AMP levels. The decrease in mitochondrial ATP was greater with 400 microM glyburide compared with 2.0 mM tolbutamide. Glyburide also decreased mitochondrial acetyl-coenzyme A/CoASH ratio. Additionally, glyburide and tolbutamide stimulated pyruvate (5 mM) supported mitochondrial respiration in the absence of ADP. These data indicate that these sulfonylureas inhibit the metabolic flux through the pyruvate carboxylase reaction by decreasing mitochondrial ATP/ADP and acetyl-coenzyme A/CoASH ratios. Decreased mitochondrial nucleotide content and increased mitochondrial respiration caused by sulfonylureas suggest that these compounds may uncouple oxidative phosphorylation.\r"

  ".U": "88332678\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of bumetanide on Na transport in the isolated toad urinary bladder were investigated. When applied to the serosal side, this loop diuretic inhibited Na transport. By contrast, when applied to the mucosal side, it stimulated Na transport by increasing the apical Na permeability. These dual effects of bumetanide were also observed with the loop diuretic furosemide. The mucosal action of bumetanide was attributable to release of Na self-inhibition, as evidenced by its dependency on mucosal Na concentration and its interaction with another apical Na permeability stimulator, p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate. The stimulatory action of bumetanide was not reduced by the natriferic effect of antidiuretic hormone, but it was totally blockable by the epithelial Na channel blocker amiloride. Bumetanide, however, caused a leftward shift of the concentration-response curve of amiloride on Na current as predicted from its effect on Na self-inhibition. This stimulatory activity of bumetanide and furosemide as demonstrated in the in vitro isolated amphibian epithelia suggests that these loop diuretics also have the potential to stimulate Na transport at the distal portion of the mammalian nephron. Thus, this property of these diuretics might be one of the factors contributing to the observation of increased Na reabsorption along the distal tubule after in vivo administration of furosemide and piretanide as reported in some micropuncture studies.\r"

  ".W": "Cell locomotion is an essential requirement for invasion and metastasis of malignant cells. We have previously described the characterization of a 50-kilodalton autocrine motility factor (AMF), a cytokine that stimulates motility in human tumor cells. In this study, we investigated the elaboration of this factor in vivo by human bladder carcinoma and in vitro by a cultured transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder cell line T24P. Urine samples from patients with bladder cancer were assayed for their capacity to stimulate migration of tumor cells. Comparing all TCC cases (22 patients) with all nonmalignant diagnoses (27 patients), we found a statistically significant (P less than .001) difference in the motility values. Invasive TCC cases (15 patients) were significantly (P less than .002) higher in regard to motility values compared with noninvasive TCC cases (8 patients), including one case of carcinoma in situ. In follow-up screening studies evaluating TCC recurrence, the recurrent tumors (9 patients) were higher (P less than .001) in regard to motility values than the tumor-free cases (11 patients). Furthermore, T24P cells showed a dose-dependent motile response to their own serum-free conditioned medium as well as to the AMF present in the urine of TCC patients. This finding is consistent with the source of AMF in the urine of these patients being the cancer itself. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for AMF was also developed. Values determined by ELISA correlated well with the motility values measured separately. These data support the potential usefulness of AMF as a urine marker for bladder TCC.\r"

The maximum tolerated dose was 6 g of cyclophosphamide/m2 and 720 mg of thiotepa/m2. No significant dose of melphalan could be added. Stomatitis was dose limiting. Eleven of 20 patients who were able to be evaluated responded. Plasma thiotepa concentrations correlated more closely with toxicity and response than with drug dose level. Continuous infusion cyclophosphamide and thiotepa is an active core regimen for the further design of high-dose combination chemotherapy regimens.\r"

With a monthly injection of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue 4 patients (2 per cent) experienced a transient increase in bone pain, 1 had ureteral obstruction and 1 suffered paraplegia during the first few weeks of therapy. Over-all objective and subjective responses were similar to those obtained by castration or estrogen therapy.

This osteolysis was evaluated by measuring the increased area of bone resorption by its reduced opacity to X-ray, and histology. Etidronate disodium, a diphosphonate derivative, at a dose of three mg./kg. and 10 mg./kg. s.c. protected the bone by decreasing the extent of osteolysis as judged by the above criteria. This inhibition was obtained with no apparent effect on the growth of the tumor. These results are discussed in light of recent clinical work, showing that this animal model is a useful tool to test the effect of new drugs against osteolysis of cancer as well as to study the biology of local interaction between bone and cancer cell.\r"

Cell numbers were quantified by deoxyribonucleic acid assay or isotopic counting of indium 111-labeled ECs. Saturation density for cell attachment was 3.55 +/- 0.29 x 10(5) cells per square centimeter of graft. After 1 hour of in vitro perfusion at 100 ml/min, 92.8% +/- 1.8% of cells remained attached and the flow surface was morphologically confluent. When grafts were inserted as extension segments into arteriovenous silicone rubber (Silastic) shunts in baboons, thereby exposing the endothelialized grafts to native flowing blood (100 ml/min) for 1 hour, the EC monolayers remained confluent with 81.05% +/- 5.88% of the cells attached.

Previous studies indicate that glutamine (GLN), which is not present in elemental diets, is the preferred oxidative substrate for the gut and may facilitate intestinal recovery after injury. This study investigated the effects of a glutamine-supplemented elemental diet (GLN-ED) on nutritional status, intestinal morphometry, bacterial translocation and survival in this lethal model of intestinal injury. Three experiments were performed. In the first experiment, rats received an intragastric elemental diet supplemented with either 2% GLN or an equivalent amount of glycine (Control). After 4 days animals received either MTX, 20 mg/kg ip, or saline ip and were killed 3 days later. The GLN-ED resulted in significantly decreased weight loss, improved nitrogen retention, and increased mucosal weight, protein, and DNA content of the jejunum and colon. In the second experiment rats were assigned to diet as in the first experiment, but all animals received MTX. Control diet animals died within 120 hrs of MTX administration. The GLN-ED group had significantly longer survival time and decreased mortality. In the third experiment animals were assigned to diet and MTX as in the first experiment. Ninety-six hrs later aortic blood cultures revealed enteric bacteremia in animals administered MTX. GLN-ED resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of bacteremia. These experiments showed that a GLN-ED significantly improved nutritional status, decreased intestinal injury, decreased bacterial translocation, and resulted in improved survival in a lethal model of enterocolitis.\r"

Each 80 patients in the control and the BCAA groups completed the trial. The group receiving BCAA-enriched amino acid solution demonstrated a statistically significant improvement on days 2 and 3 in nitrogen balance in patients with total gastrectomy. Three-methyl-histidine excretion gradually decreased after day 1, and the values on day 7 were significantly lower than those on day 1 in the BCAA group in both those receiving subtotal and total gastrectomy.

Plasma BCAA level and BCAA to aromatic amino acid (AAA) ratio were significantly higher, and AAA level was significantly lower in the BCAA group than in the control group. There were no serious complications encountered during the observation period in both groups. These results indicated that a BCAA-enriched amino acid solution can improve metabolism and maintains good nitrogen retention without increasing side effects as compared with a conventional amino acid solution for nutritional support of patients who have received subtotal or total gastrectomy.\r"

  ".W": "The hypermetabolic state observed in thermally injured patients warrants aggressive nutritional management. Enteral support is the preferred route of nutrient delivery, however diarrhea is reported to be a persistent complication of continuous nasogastric or nasoduodenal hyperalimentation. Diarrhea adds to problems in patient care, disturbs fluid and electrolyte balance, and worsens nutritional status. There has been the impression that tube feeding hyperosmolality, antibiotics, and low serum albumin induce diarrhea. However, in view of the sparsity of published work, a prospective study was undertaken to determine the incidence of diarrhea and to define factors associated with its cause. Of the 50 patients studied, 16 (32%) developed diarrhea. Stool cultures were negative for pathogenic organisms. Although the risk of diarrhea was associated with antibiotics (p less than 0.005), several nutrients also had an impact. Results demonstrated a significant relationship between dietary lipid content (p less than 0.05) or vitamin A intake (p less than 0.001) and diarrhea. Implementation of tube feeding within 48 hrs postburn was also associated with a decreased incidence of diarrhea (p less than 0.001). This paper describes a modular tube feeding program in which diarrheal frequency is lessened (p less than 0.0001). Surprisingly, tube feeding osmolality, drugs used to prevent stress ulcers, or hypoalbuminemia did not have an adverse effect on intestinal absorption. The cause of diarrhea in burn patients is obviously multifactorial. It is concluded that a low fat (less than 20% of caloric intake), vitamin A enriched (greater than 10,000 IU/day), early enteral support program maximizes conditions which promote tube feeding tolerance while minimizing nutrient malabsorption during the nutritional rehabilitation of thermal injury.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to explore the fate of a single dose of labeled selenium as determined by its route of administration. Thus, the appearance of a stable isotope of selenium, administered as 74-Se-selenite, was measured in plasma, urine, and feces, with neutron activation analysis, following a 81.7 micrograms dose of 74Se-selenite given either intravenously or orally in two groups (n = 4) of healthy, young adult men, who were otherwise maintained on a diet providing a constant and adequate selenium intake. From these isotopic data, measurable parameters of urine excretion, total body retention and selenite-exchangeable metabolic pool (Se-EMP) were defined to provide a quantitative assessment of selenium metabolism in these subjects. The initial 24-hr urine excretion of the label was higher for the intravenously administered label (18.2 +/- 2.1% of dose) compared to the oral dose (11.7 +/- 2.6% absorbed dose). Thereafter, the excretion of isotope was the same for both groups. For equivalent entry of Se into the body, measured total body retention and Se-EMP were the same for both groups. These initial kinetic data suggest that the overall utilization of selenium from a single administration of selenite is comparable for the two routes of intake and that the host's selenium requirement can probably be met adequately via the intravenous administration of selenite.\r"

We attempted to answer this question by culturing both conventional (C) total parenteral nutrition (TPN), in which the FE and D/AA are given separately, and the 3-in-1 admixture TPN, in which all components are delivered in one bag. Two-hundred TPN fluid cultures were obtained serially by collecting 1 ml of fluid from the distal-most connection when the TPN was changed every 24 hrs. Quantiative and qualitative cultures were obtained. One hundred sixty-six (83%) were negative. Of the 34 (17%) positive cultures, 15 (17% of 88) were from the conventional system whereas 19 (17% of 112) were from the 3-in-1 system. Six clinically septic patients furnished 11 TPN fluid specimens which grew greater than 400 colonies/ml. Seven (8% of 88) of these were from the conventional system whereas four (3.6% of 112) were from the 3-in-1 system. All had distant sites of sepsis.

During two successive 7-day periods, 12 patients received randomly either standard continuous (infusion 24 hr/day) or cyclic (infusion between 5 pm and 9 am) total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Calorie and nitrogen intakes were identical during both periods. Energy expenditure was investigated by indirect calorimetry and showed practically no difference between continuous standard (1383 +/- 41 kcal/day-1) and cyclic total parenteral nutrition (1428 +/- 46 kcal/day-1). However, in the cyclic regimen, when compared with continuous infusion, energy expenditure was higher between 5 pm and 9 am and lower between 9 am and 5 pm. At the end of the noninfusion period, the 24-hr profile of the nonprotein respiratory quotient showed a slight decrease in patients receiving the cyclic infusion, in contrast with the stability of the quotient in the standard regimen. However, the nitrogen balance and variations in nutritional status did not differ significantly. In conclusion cyclic TPN is efficient for achieving a positive energy and nitrogen balance and in addition it induces a metabolic profile closer to physiological conditions.\r"

  ".U": "88333321\r", 
  ".W": "A prospective controlled study of the safety of various catheter dressing protocols was carried out in 168 patients receiving parenteral nutrition via an infraclavicular central venous catheter. Four protocols were compared: 36 patients received gauze dressings changed three times per week; 31 received OpSite dressings changed every 7th day (OpS-7), 32 received OpSite changed every 10th day (OpS-10), and 69 received OpSite changed twice weekly (OpS-ICU). Mean duration of parenteral nutrition was approximately 2 weeks and all groups were well matched except that OpS-ICU patients suffered more frequently from an acute illness. Catheter-related sepsis was identified by clinical signs of systemic sepsis, positive peripheral venous blood and catheter-tip cultures and/or defervescence of fever after catheter removal. Catheter-related sepsis rates were low in all groups: 1/36 for Gauze, 0/31 for OpS-7, 1/32 for OpS-10, and 2/69 for OpS-ICU. Septicemia attributable to causes apart from catheter sepsis occurred in two, two, three, and four patients, respectively. Bacterial colonization of skin beneath OpSite was no more common in the OpS-10 than in the other groups. Signs of inflammation at catheter insertion sites were common in all groups but did not relate closely to skin colonization. OpSite can be safely applied to central venous catheters inserted under strict aseptic conditions, even in patients with open septic drainage. Dressings can be left in place for 7 days with a margin of safety lasting to 10 days, thus saving on cost of materials and nursing time.\r"

Using accepted criteria, LOM was present in 59 and 48% of medical and surgical patients, respectively. Patients with LOM were 2.6 or 3.4 times as likely to have a predefined minor or major complication, respectively; and 3.8 times as likely to die as patients without LOM (all p less than 0.001). In every diagnosis-related group, the mean length of stay was longer for LOM patients (range 1.1-12.8 excess days). Accountants converted charges to direct variable costs using departmental cost-to-charge ratios. LOM status increased excess costs and charges per patient by $1738 and $3557, respectively (p less than 0.0001). When complications occurred, LOM patients incurred $2996 or $6157 excess costs and charges per patient (p less than 0.01). Serum albumin was the strongest clinical predictor of cost. The hospitals' cost of providing enteral or parenteral nutrition support was $18 or $102 per day, respectively. Too few patients received early nutrition support to assess efficacy. Nonetheless, the costs associated with malnutrition warrant early detection and aggressive treatment.\r"

The infants were of normal birth weight, in good clinical and metabolic condition, and aged from 1-4 months. They all received total parenteral nutrition after birth for more than 1 month; the only lipid was provided by iv Intralipid 20%, at levels approximating 350 mg/kg/24 h of linoleic acid (2.5% of the infants' total daily energy intake). Study of the fatty acids of plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids in these infants, compared to healthy controls of the same age (N = 26), showed that 350 mg/kg/24 hr of C18:2w6 supply resulted in normalization of erythrocyte phospholipid fatty acid distribution. This was particularly true of the higher homologues of C18:2w6 (C18:3w6, C20:3w6, and C20:4w6). This suggested that delta 6 and delta 5 desaturation activities are normal in these conditions with this C18:2w6 supply. These results were confirmed by the study of 24-hr urinary excretion of prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. With 350 mg/kg/24 hr of C18:2w6 supply their urinary levels were not significantly different from those observed in normal children of the same age receiving an equivalent oral C18:2w6 intake.\r"

Experimental conditions included presence or absence of Intralipid iv fat emulsion, plastic bag or glass bottle storage container, and storage time of up to 48 hrs. The second phase studied stability of the same vitamins (except vitamin E) for 48 hrs in admixtures containing the amino acid solution which has no bisulfite, in glass bottles; with or without Intralipid; and with added sodium bisulfite (final concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 mEq/liter). Third, vitamin C and thiamin levels were measured in admixtures containing the amino acid solution with no bisulfite, without Intralipid, stored in glass bottles with various bisulfite concentrations (0, 1, 2, or 3 mEq/liter) and three pH levels (5.5, 6.5, and 6.75 pH). Exposure of TPN admixtures to phototherapy light caused losses of vitamins A, C, and riboflavin. Intralipid inclusion significantly reduced losses of vitamin A and riboflavin, but did not appear to affect vitamin C levels. The smallest vitamin C losses were noted in admixtures containing amino acid solutions A or B. Phototherapy light did not affect thiamin levels. Bisulfite had no affect on vitamin C, riboflavin, or folic acid levels. Vitamin A levels were maintained with bisulfite concentrations less than 3 mEq/liter. At 3 mEq/liter bisulfite, admixtures with Intralipid showed 50% loss of vitamin A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No clotting was observed for Citrotein (intact protein formula in powder form), Vital, Vivonex TEN, and Hepatic Aid II. Adding protein did not cause or increase clotting. In summary, clotting of some liquid formula diet appears to be an important factor causing possible gastric feeding tube occlusion. The following measures may help in preventing this problem: flushing before and after aspirating for gastric residuals to eliminate acid precipitation of formula in the feeding tube, advance the nasogastric feeding tube into the duodenum if possible, and avoid mixing these products with liquid medications having a pH value of 5.0 or less.\r"

When hyperemesis is unresponsive to conventional management, intravenous hydration should be instituted without delay to preserve maternal intravascular blood volume and thus placental blood flow.

This study confirms earlier suggestions of the beneficial effect of CO2 inhalation at high altitude.\r"

Further, in the RA group, plasma IL-1 beta correlated positively with Ritchie joint index, pain score, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and correlated negatively with haemoglobin concentration. In individual patients with active disease who had serial measurements, plasma IL-1 beta also correlated with clinical disease activity. These results support the idea that IL-1 beta has a central role in the pathogenesis of RA.\r"

In addition, all of these proteins contain seven putative transmembrane alpha-helices. We have previously described a genomic clone, G-21, isolated by cross-hybridization at reduced stringency with a full length beta 2-adrenergic receptor probe. This clone contains an intronless gene which, because of its striking sequence resemblance to the adrenergic receptors, is presumed to encode a G-protein-coupled receptor. Previous attempts to identify this putative receptor by expression studies have failed. We now report that the protein product of the genomic clone, G21, transiently expressed in monkey kidney cells has all the typical ligand-binding characteristics of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A) receptor.\r"

This coincidence suggests that expression of the hsp68-lacZ construct may be controlled directly by cis-acting regulatory sequences that normally control the developmental expression of the dt gene. Such constructs may serve as useful tools for identifying new tissue-specific enhancers and their associated genes.\r"

In the light of evidence indicating that one natural function of CD4 is as a growth factor receptor, we examined the ability of native gp120 to activate resting CD4-bearing lymphocytes. Our results indicate that gp120 has innate biological activity as a result of a specific interaction with CD4, inducing increases in intracellular levels of inositol trisphosphate and of calcium, and in interleukin-2 receptor expression and cell motility.\r"

Phosphonates have been found in bacteria, fungi, and higher organisms such as the snail schistosome vector Biomphalaria. The biosynthetic path to the P-C bond has, however, remained undefined. Thus although it was shown twenty years ago that the isotope label from [14C]glucose or from [32P]phosphoenolpyruvate is incorporated into 2-aminoethylphosphonate by the protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis, the presumed stoichiometric transformation of phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate has never been demonstrated. Low conversions of phosphoenolpyruvate into 2-aminoethylphosphonate and the trapping of phosphonopyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate have been reported, but these reactions have not proved reproducible, and the existence of the critical enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphonomutase, has remained notional. We now report experiments that resolve this enigma, and describe the isolation and characterization of the pure mutase from T. pyriformis.\r"

All patients showed low basal serum levels of estradiol and six had a poor or absent response to human menopausal gonadotropin. One subject had intact pituitary-gonadal function and one patient had an impaired LH and FSH response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the presence of a significant increase of estradiol after human menopausal gonadotropin stimulation. The findings regarding pituitary hormones other than gonadotropins suggest that iron overload damages tropic cells unequally and inconsistently. We conclude that both pituitary and gonadal damage may be responsible for the secondary amenorrhea in thalassemic patients.\r"

Each subject was injected with low-dose animal antigen, as determined by skin test end point titration, or with placebo. Twenty minutes after the injection, bronchoprovocative challenge was performed with the use of the same antigen. The provocative dose 20% (PD20), FEV1 after antigen injection, was 28.52 +/- 1.74, was compared to 6.50 +/- 1.15 after placebo injection (p less than 0.01). This experiment was repeated after pretreatment of patients with indomethacin. The protective effect of antigen injection was abolished. In a third experiment, the PD20, FEV1 for methacholine, was 10.74 breath units (BU) after antigen injection and 6.84 BU after placebo injection (PD less than 0.05). Low-dose antigen injection causes rapid reduction of bronchial sensitivity to inhaled antigen and methacholine. This effect is abolished by treatment with indomethacin.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether established cell lines from human head and neck cancers under chemotherapy behaved similarly to tumors in patients during in vivo treatment. This is of interest in terms of improvements of chemotherapeutic protocols and understanding of the mechanisms of cytotoxic drug resistance. Permanent squamous carcinoma cell lines of the larynx (HLaC 78, 79), parotid gland (HPaC 79), tongue (SCC-15, SCC-25), hypopharynx (FaDu), and tumor lines with different histology and origin, as mucoepidermoid cancer cells of the submandibular gland (A 253), Epstein-Barr virus-infected human B cells (BC-1) and mouse fibroblasts (3T3) were incubated with chemotherapeutic drugs for 1 to 4 days at 37 degrees C. Despite the microscopic similarities to patient carcinomas, cancer cell lines of the head and neck showed different susceptibilities to cell kill mediated by chemotherapeutic drugs, as compared to in vivo therapeutic results with patients. The nonsquamous carcinoma lines demonstrated high chemosensitive responses after incubation with daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin, vincristine, and aclarubicin. Surprisingly, only low cell killing rates in squamous carcinoma cell lines were observed after incubation with chemotherapeutic agents such as cis-platinum, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, or bleomycin, which are most commonly used for head and neck cancers. The results show that cytotoxic drug action on in vitro cultured squamous carcinoma cell lines of the head and neck is not representative for the in vivo responses of patient tumors. The cell lines are, however, of potential value for evaluation of cell biochemical changes associated with cytotoxic drug resistance.\r"

The epithelial migration rates of the gerbils aged 3 to 6 months, 9 to 12 months, and 24 to 30 months were approximately 116, 113, and 86 micron per day, respectively. These findings suggest that the low epithelial migration rate on the tympanic membrane and external ear canal might play an important role on the high occurrence rate of external ear keratosis that results from accumulation of keratin debris in the aged gerbil ears.\r"

  ".W": "Monitoring auditory evoked potentials, especially surface recorded responses (ABR), during neuro-otologic surgery is being widely used. Recording of the most peripheral components of the ABR with surface electrodes can be difficult, however, in patients with hearing loss. To enhance wave I, a newly designed canal electrode for noninvasive electrocochleography (ECoG) has been used. A small reticulated foam plug is inserted in the ear canal and serves as the electrode. The signal is transduced through a center polyethylene tube. The advantages of this system for ECoG are several: (1) simplified signal presentation, obviating the need for custom ear mold or button transducer; (2) large electrode surface area that lowers impedance and improves signal to noise ratio; and (3) stability of the electrode during manipulations within the surgical field. There are several advantages to supplementing ABR with simultaneous ECoG. First, there is a significant enhancement in wave I amplitude, an important factor when monitoring from hearing impaired patients in an operating room environment. Ability to clearly define wave I permits use of the I-V interwave interval, which can be a more sensitive parameter than wave V latency alone. Secondly, more rapid feedback on changes in cochlear function is available since, compared to surface recordings alone, fewer responses need to be averaged.\r"

  ".W": "The effectiveness of Rhodamine-123 (Rh-123) as a new photochemosensitizing agent for the argon laser treatment of human melanoma and squamous carcinoma cells in vitro was recently demonstrated. In this study, a new technique of \"rosette\" treatment with the argon laser was developed to completely eradicate human squamous carcinoma (P3) tumor transplants in nude mice after chemosensitization with Rh-123. Each group included four nu/nu mice injected subcutaneously with 10(7) P3 carcinoma cells/site for a total of 48 sites. Tumor take was greater than 95% at one week, with greater than 10 mm3 tumor volume at each site. Test groups were sensitized with Rh-123 (1 microgram/ml for 1 hour) by intratumor or intraperitoneal injection at 1 week and then treated with the argon laser at 514.5 nm. To allow uniform delivery of energies to the tumor and its edges, a new \"rosette\" technique was developed. The tumors were then exposed to nonthermal levels of 700 J/cm2 (36 degrees C) or 950 J/cm2 (40 degrees C) as determined by a new and reproducible method of dosimetry. All 16 tumors in this test group showed complete regression with excellent wound healing at 2 weeks and no recurrences, even after an 8 week followup. These results demonstrate that effective eradication of tumors can be achieved in vivo only after sensitization with Rh-123 and specific argon laser treatment (\"rosette\"), even at nonthermal levels of energies. The high effectiveness of this technique and low toxicity of Rh-123 may render its clinical use very attractive for the treatment of superficial malignancies.\r"

To determine the incidence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with epistaxis treated with both anterior and posterior nasal packs, we obtained polysomnograms on twelve patients while the packs were in place. Ten of these patients demonstrated obstructive sleep apnea. The apnea index (apneas/hour sleep) ranged from 1 to 83, with a mean of 29; the hypopnea index (hypopneas/hour sleep) ranged from 9 to 33, with a mean of 20; and the lowest oxygen saturation (SaO2) ranged from 17% to 91%, with a mean of 77%. Ten patients returned for another polysomnogram after removal of the packs. These baseline studies showed improvement in the apnea index and in the lowest SaO2 in all patients, although four patients still demonstrated at least mild obstructive sleep apnea. This study demonstrates that nasal packs used for the treatment of epistaxis may induce obstructive sleep apnea or markedly exacerbate underlying obstructive sleep apnea and, therefore, contribute to the sudden deaths that have been reported in epistaxis patients.\r"

The site of injury on the papilla was described in terms of hair-cell loss and location. The ears with no recovery showed a discrete lesion area, within which there was complete disruption of the hair-cell field and a 35% loss in hair cells. After 14 days' recovery, no hair cell loss could be detected, though the lesion could still be recognized by the disorganization of hair cells in the previously injured area. These data demonstrate hair-cell restoration after severe acoustic injury from intense sound exposure in the neonatal ear.\r"

Cross-hospital comparisons showed considerable interesting variation, yet to be explained, in minutes of care but there was considerable consistency in the relative nursing intensity of DRGs. Because of differences in staffing and charging practices, intensive care and routine floor care should be separated in any further study of nursing intensity. And because different clinical services show large differences in nursing resource use, costing nursing should be done at least at the service level, if not the actual unit level. A method for establishing a nationwide data set in which nursing could be included is suggested. The virtue of this approach is to provide cross-hospital evidence on which policy decisions about weighting DRGs for nursing in deciding reimbursement levels could be made. In addition, such a system would require hospitals to account for nursing separately from other hospital costs, with attendant benefits for nursing management.\r"

  ".W": "Nursing Case Management as described here was developed in less than ideal conditions: a full census, a 30 per cent increase in patient volume over five years, a nursing shortage, no grants or outside funding, no clinical specialists or clinical ladder, and no computerized documentation system. No more staff or salary was added as we focused our attention on the new tools, roles, and structures necessary to achieve cost and quality outcomes. However, nursing case management has worked because of some very key elements: 1. A firm commitment to the belief that staff nurses must be accountable for the outcomes of the care that they have planned, given, managed, and continuously evaluated. 2. A combination of top-down organizational development strategies with excellent staff nurse involvement at each juncture. 3. Negotiation and collaboration with physicians and hospital administration at key turning points. This includes the relentless articulation of patient-centered care. 4. A willingness to learn and risk together as a whole department--across levels, across specialties. This includes a constant balance of moving from concrete examples and problems to reconceptualizing the issues. 5. Listening, responsiveness, humor, and acknowledging contributions of everyone. More than any other principal, the case manager must be a central caregiver to a patient to ensure cost/quality outcomes. Otherwise case management only adds to the cost of health care by adding another level of bureaucracy. Nurses have always managed the care of patients, but to stay effective and committed, they need to take increased authority in their patients' entire episode of care and develop formal collaborative practice groups. In other words: \"Prospective payment has changed the health care product from a day of care (or a visit) to an entire case or episode of illness. More than just a new way of paying for care, it has changed our way of planning, managing, and thinking about health care.\" Looking at the future entails understanding our business, and then changing our practice patterns for the change in the times. Necessity will foster invention; Nursing Case Management provides a model and technology for innovation.\r"

  ".W": "The costs associated with a growing population of elderly persons in the United States combined with a need to restrain escalating acute care costs led to the development of a prospective payment system (PPS) for institutional long-term care in New York State. Although similar types of PPS exist in several other states, it is expected that RUGs will become the model for the nation. The price paid is based on a formula that combines the direct care components of care with allocated medical and ancillary costs per patient. Based on a patient classification case-mix system, the Resource Utilization Group (RUG) relies on specific nursing documentation of patient care delivered, that is, resource used. Implemented at the same time as diagnostic-related groups (DRGs), the RUGs system is not based on length of stay, diagnosis, or age. Activities of daily living (ADL) drive the system and, in that sense, RUGs has some similarities to severity of illness models. There are 16 RUGs (that is, 16 case-mix indexes and 16 prices), ranging from skilled rehabilitation and intensive skilled nursing care to light custodial care. Patients assessed at the low end of the spectrum--light care, lowest price--may be denied admission to nursing homes as well as prepared for discharge to the community or a lighter level of care. Discharge planning and patient teaching for less dependent living are recent phenomena in nursing homes. Nurses have to learn how to manage the complex, technologically dependent patient as well as learn aspects of preparing the patient--and family--for discharge. The challenge to nursing is to protect the patient from negative incentives inherent in the RUGs system; analyze the nursing process and productivity; and contribute to research that should be observing the effect of the reimbursement system on the quality of care.\r"

  ".W": "The DRGs and their aftermath have had an effect on all who are involved with home health care services, including the patient and provider. The staff of home health agencies must be competent, caring professionals who must also be able to cope with the regulatory issues that affect patient care. The effects on patients and families have also increased. Today's health care environment is requiring that they be responsible for self-care programs for many hi-tech procedures as well as care for those who are terminally ill. They are discovering that reimbursement is not available for the many services that they consider necessary, but that third-party payers consider these services to be of a custodial nature and, therefore, nonreimbursable. The effect on physicians is an increased amount of paperwork for home care services, as a result of frequent admissions to and discharges from service and changes in the frequency of visits or treatment plans. There is also the need for the timely signing of the required forms for agencies to meet the requirements of the Medicare program. The effects on the agencies include attempting to maintain financial solvency while providing quality health care services; maintaining staff morale and productivity; making hi-tech services available at an increased cost on a 24-hour basis by qualified staff to remain competitive; and guaranteeing safe, sound policies and procedures for patients and staff. Certainly the advent of DRGs has also had an impact on the nursing profession as it relates to home health care. The benefits of community health nursing identified in the past are no longer applicable in 1988. The job characteristics have changed and are no longer as attractive as they once were to nurses. In a recent publication I said there are times when I feel that I know what a swimmer experiences when being pounded by unrelenting waves in a rough surf. There is hardly time to catch your breath before the next wave hits. The DRG aftermath is just one of these waves. In spite of these never-ending waves, and the multiple internal and external changes, administrators must manage in an effective and efficient manner. We can survive the present turmoil and help to shape the future of the home care industry. Peter Drucker suggests in Managing in Turbulent Times that one should feed the opportunities and starve the problems. The challenge is to view our never-ending waves as opportunities that can take us to new heights in 1988.\r"

Community health nurses need an alternative to the traditional medical definition of quality. In spite of medical DRGs, when the concept of outcome measurement is presented appropriately to nurses, the opportunity is created for them to quantify the effects of nursing care provided positively, not as another paper exercise for Medicare reimbursement. In addition, the ability to quantify outcome indicators now will establish the framework for developing more specific outcome measures in the future. Client-oriented program objectives provide a structure for evaluating the quality of your agency's services and to demonstrate accountability to the consumers of your services. Nurses are encouraged to take a proactive stance and to examine their major service programs in light of the client outcomes their home care services are intended to achieve. Development of one or two major COPOs for each service program can be easily managed by using the steps outlined in this article.\r"

Patients taking more than one drug had reduced levels also (p less than 0.001), but in patients treated with sodium valproate alone there was no significant decrease in red cell folate levels compared to controls. Twenty-two per cent of patients in the group taking more than one drug had reduced levels of red cell folate compared with 17 per cent of those taking carbamazepine alone, 13 per cent of those taking phenytoin only, and 9 per cent of those taking sodium valproate only. Dietary folate intake was significantly reduced in all the patient groups compared with controls (p less than 0.001 for the carbamazepine and phenytoin groups, p less than 0.01 for the polypharmacy and sodium valproate groups); a significant correlation between red cell folate levels and dietary folate was not established. Significant negative relationships were established between carbamazepine dose (r = -0.35, p less than 0.01) or serum level (r = -0.27, p less than 0.05) and red cell folate level in patients on one drug only. The correlation between dose or serum level of phenytoin and red cell folate level was also negative but did not reach significance. Our findings show that all anticonvulsant drugs interfere with folate metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Transfection of deleted forms of the IL-2R alpha promoter and in vitro DNA-binding studies revealed that a 12-base pair promoter segment, which has homology with the binding site for NF-kappa B, was required for Tax-induced activation of the IL-2R alpha promoter in vivo. An 18-base pair oligonucleotide containing this kappa B-like regulatory element proved sufficient to confer Tax inducibility upon a heterologous promoter. DNA affinity precipitation assays showed that Tax, like mitogenic stimuli, induced the expression of the 86-kilodalton cellular protein HIVEN86A, which specifically binds to the IL-2R alpha kappa B element in vitro. Furthermore, DNA/protein cross-linking studies revealed that several polypeptides interact with this sequence motif. Thus, the deregulation of IL-2R alpha gene expression encountered in HTLV-I leukemias appears to involve Tax activation of one or more cellular proteins that are normally induced by mitogens and that directly contribute to transcriptional activation of this receptor gene.\r"

The airway response to inhaled Atrovent and preservative free ipratropium bromide nebuliser solutions has been examined in a double blind study. On separate occasions 30 asthmatic subjects inhaled 2 ml of the solutions and airway calibre was measured in terms of FEV1 for 45 minutes. Atrovent nebuliser solution provoked a greater than 20% fall in FEV1 in five of the 30 subjects, whereas this did not occur after preservative free ipratropium bromide. Inhalation of the preservative free solution resulted in more rapid and greater overall bronchodilatation than Atrovent, with mean maximum increases in FEV1 of 29.2% and 18.5% respectively. It is concluded that the risk of paradoxical bronchoconstriction with ipratropium bromide is considerably reduced by removal of benzalkonium chloride and EDTA and that preservative free ipratropium bromide is a more potent bronchodilator than the currently available Atrovent solution.\r"

By indirect immunofluorescence, the patients' IgG anti-A reacted with platelets from group A1 donors but not with those from group A2 donors. A2 platelets were at least 38 times less efficient at adsorbing a mouse monoclonal anti-A; the difference between the adsorbence capacities of A2 and O platelets was minimal. Transfusion of A2 platelets, unlike that of A1 platelets, effected a good increment in the platelet counts of these two patients.

We believe that the antibody was produced by passively transferred B lymphocytes in the donor kidney, and that the recipient may have been protected from more serious hemolysis by immunosuppressive agents administered at the time of transplantation. The donor received multiple transfusions before transplantation, but his serum lacked anti-c in a screen performed shortly before his death. This case raises the possibility that donor alloantibodies to other Rh antigens on recipient RBCs can arise after transplantation, if the donor has been transfused.\r"

There were positive and independent correlations between tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity after venous occlusion and HbA1c, and between triglycerides and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and tPA antigen concentrations before and after venous occlusion. The tPA activities both at rest and after venous occlusion were higher in the patients. There were no differences with regard to sex, hypertension or nephropathy for the levels of fibrinolytic variables in these patients. Subjects with retinopathy did not differ from those without retinopathy. Diabetes duration showed a significant negative association with tPA activity in multivariate regression analysis. Tobacco-smoking diabetics, as compared to non-smoking, had an increased tPA antigen release at venous occlusion, but also higher PAI-1 levels and reduced specific activity of the tPA protein. When assessed with the new specific assays now available, the fibrinolytic parameters appear to be specific indicators of endothelial dysfunction related to smoking and to degree of glycaemic control in type I diabetic subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Of 65 patients with posterior septal accessory pathways, 6 were found intraoperatively to have a previously unrecognized pathologic entity: a coronary sinus (CS) diverticulum in the posterior septal region. The CS diverticulum is a venous pouch within the left ventricular wall, with a neck opening into the CS. The pouch, 2 to 5 cm in diameter, has a deep wall corresponding to the left ventricular wall, with venous channel openings and a thin superficial wall made of myocardium. The CS diverticulum neck is 5 to 10-mm wide, opens into the CS and is proximal to the midcardiac vein. Using an epicardial approach during normothermic bypass, the neck of the CS diverticulum was identified, separated from the left ventricle and then closed. Accessory pathway conduction disappeared only after separation of the CS diverticulum neck. The accessory pathway is intimately related to the diverticulum. The latter is a bridge between the left ventricle and the right or left atrium. The accessory pathways associated with CS diverticula had short anterograde refractory periods and were associated with potentially malignant arrhythmias. An epicardial operative approach with division of the neck of the diverticulum is recommended when surgery is indicated.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of atrial dimensions for release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), right and left atrial dimensions (cross-sections) were determined by 2-dimensional echocardiography in 50 patients with left-sided valvular heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. All patients underwent right- and left-sided heart catheterization with measurement of central hemodynamics. Plasma samples for ANP were withdrawn from femoral vein (ANPv) and ascending aorta. An estimate of right and left meridional atrial wall stress was derived by multiplying cross-sectional areas with pressures of the respective atria. As expected ANPv was closely related to mean right (r = 0.63; p less than 0.001; n = 50) and left atrial pressures (r = 0.61; p less than 0.001; n = 47). Furthermore, a positive correlation between ANPv and right (r = 0.56; p less than 0.001; n = 48) and left (r = 0.30; p less than 0.05; n = 48) atrial cross-sections was obtained. Finally, an excellent relation was found between ANPv and right (r = 0.73; p less than 0.001; n = 48) as well as left (r = 0.58; p less than 0.001; n = 44) meridional atrial wall stress, indicating that atrial wall stress rather than atrial pressures or dimensions alone determines plasma ANP concentrations. However, for identical right and left meridional atrial wall stress 3- to 4-times higher plasma ANPv levels were obtained in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy than in patients with left-sided valvular heart disease. This indicates that release of ANP to the same stimulus may be modulated by the nature of the underlying heart disease.\r"

Right ventricular levels were significantly higher than femoral venous levels (p less than 0.01), but the correlation between the 2 was high (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that right ventricular ANF concentrations were predicted by a combination of indexed right atrial area measured by 2-dimensional echocardiography, right atrial pressure, pulmonary resistance and heart rate (multiple r2 = 0.83). Femoral venous ANF concentrations were predicted by indexed right atrial area and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (multiple r2= 0.79). It was concluded that there are significant independent predictors of right ventricular and femoral venous plasma ANF concentrations in children with congenital heart disease. The right atrial area indexed by body surface area was the only significant predictor of both central and peripheral plasma ANF concentrations in the multivariate analysis.\r"

In a crossover design each patient received two 6-d periods of isocaloric and isonitrogenous infusions, differing only by the source of calories (high or low fat intakes). For an energy intake of 80 kcal.kg-1.d-1 (335 kJ.kg-1.d-1) there was a significant hypoaminoacidemia (2338 +/- 185 vs 2937 +/- 196 mumol/L, high fat vs low fat) under the high-glucose intake. These data suggest that above an energy intake of 60 kcal.kg-1.d-1 (251 kJ.kg-1.d-1) there is a threshold at which changes in plasma amino acid levels are triggered by variations in the source of infused energy. Careful examination of all variables, including energy sources, is essential when aminograms are compared.\r"

Bone formation was higher and osteoid area, bone-surface stainable Al and total bone Al were lower with amino acid TPN than with casein TPN. Bone formation varied inversely with both plasma Al and bone-surface Al, suggesting that plasma or bone-surface Al, acquired during TPN, can reduce bone formation and lead to patchy osteomalacia.

In contrast, no atrial natriuretic peptide binding sites could be identified in the brush border; the latter is exposed to maternal blood in the intervillous space.

Although intrapartum fetal heart rate patterns indicative of umbilical cord compression are common beyond 41 weeks' gestation, fetal intolerance to labor develops only in a subset of such patients. To test the hypothesis that suboptimal placental function contributes to reduced amniotic fluid volume and, ultimately, to fetal intolerance to labor, we prospectively collected biochemical and clinical data on 112 prolonged pregnancies. Data analysis was blinded to outcome and included cord blood acid-base measurements and intrapartum fetal heart rate interpretation. We observed a high incidence of umbilical cord compression (46.4%), but this finding was not predictive of emergent delivery in 32 of 52 cases (61.5%). Fetal acidosis (arterial pH less than 7.20) occurred more often in patients with cord compression, but the anticipated increase in carbon dioxide tension was not observed. Instead, a primary metabolic or combined acidosis was encountered in those fetuses delivered emergently. The additional findings of lower amniotic fluid volume and diminished birth weight in those patients delivered for fetal intolerance to labor suggest a direct role for suboptimal placental function in selected patients with prolonged pregnancy.\r"

With active management of labor, 43% of 1423 primigravid women received high-dose oxytocin augmentation during an 11-month period. Umbilical cord blood gas values from those who received high-dose oxytocin augmentation were compared with values in those who received no oxytocin. The mean arterial pH value in the no oxytocin group was 7.24 +/- 0.07, which is not significantly different (p greater than 0.10) from that of the oxytocin-augmented group, 7.23 +/- 0.07. Similarly, all other arterial and venous umbilical cord gas parameters were unaffected by high-dose oxytocin augmentation (p greater than 0.10). Our values were compared with other published values where labor was not managed according to the principles of active management of labor, and no differences were found. We report the largest series of cord blood pH values in primigravid women and conclude that there is no adverse effect of high-dose oxytocin augmentation or active management of labor on umbilical cord blood gas values at delivery.\r"

Prospective payment systems using the Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) mechanism are being phased in for payment of in-patient hospital care. One expected effect of the DRG payment scheme is a more careful financial analysis of the components of surgical care. The purposes of this study were to examine a vascular procedure, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA), performed at a large teaching hospital during a ten-year period; to characterize patients by cost (hospital charges exclusive of physician fees) and outcome; and to test the hypothesis that an IDENTIFIER, here the presence or absence and duration of hypotension (less than 90 mm Hg systolic), could predict differences in cost and outcome. The results, in conjunction with historic data, were used to quantify aggregate hospital expenditures for this condition by survivor and the identifier. The results indicate: (1) mortality is higher for the hypotensive patient than for the normotensive patient (p less than 0.05) and is related to the duration of hypotension; (2) lowest mean charges per patient were in the hypotensive more than thirty minutes group ($5,587) followed by normotensive ($28,298), then hypotensive less than thirty minutes ($43,876); and (3) the mean charges for each survivor were $42,447 for normotensive patients versus $107,572 for hypotensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes mellitus in nonpregnant adults is a chronic affliction that leads to significant vascular and neuropathic disease. Diabetes during pregnancy can lead to perinatal complications. Both of these types of diabetes are common, often asymptomatic, and readily diagnosable by glucose tolerance testing. As a result, screening can identify many previously undiagnosed patients. However there is only limited evidence that screening results in net therapeutic benefit. In the case of gestational diabetes, controlled trials indicate that hypoglycemic therapy decreases the frequency of macrosomia, but has no effect on perinatal mortality. Our analyses indicate that screening for gestational diabetes is a low-cost intervention that produces a small expected benefit. Screening for diabetes in the nonpregnant adult (almost always a type II diabetic) is not recommended, because the link between improving glucose control and reducing diabetic complications is currently too weak. Screening might be reasonable for particular patients, for example, obese persons who would be spurred to lose weight by a demonstration of glucose intolerance. Screening for type I diabetes followed by immunomodulating therapy is still too experimental for confident analysis.\r"

This antigen appears to be essential for recognition of foreign antigen and for initiation of the process of cell-mediated rejection. One hundred and two patients having orthotopic cardiac transplantation in a single program during a 3-year period received prophylactic immune suppression with OKT3, along with azathioprine and low-dose steroids. Patients began receiving cyclosporine on Day 11; steroid-weaning was attempted 3 weeks after transplantation. In this group of patients, the time to the first rejection was 76 +/- 11 days (mean +/- SEM), and 85% were successfully weaned from maintenance steroids. Avoidance of the side effects of cyclosporine and/or high dose steroids during the perioperative period, combined with a long rejection-free interval and the likelihood of long-term maintenance free of steroids, make the use of OKT3 or similar agents an attractive alternative to conventional immunosuppression.\r"

The mean (+/- SD) length of hospitalization for patients with delirium was significantly longer than for their nondelirious counterparts (21.6 +/- 23.7 days vs 10.6 +/- 10.1 days, respectively). Hospitals treating high proportions of patients with delirium as a comorbidity to a principal somatic diagnosis should institute measures for the early detection of and appropriate intervention in patients with this condition. These steps may help reduce prolonged hospitalizations and minimize financial risk under the current diagnosis related group reimbursement system.\r"

Screening of the library was carried out with synthetic oligonucleotide probes deduced from the amino acid sequences of the nonapeptides vasotocin and isotocin. The cDNA nucleotide sequences predict isotocin and vasotocin prohormone precursors each consisting of a signal peptide, a hormone moiety, and a neurophysin-like molecule. However, in comparison to their mammalian counterparts, both fish neurophysins are extended at their C termini by an approximately 30 amino acid sequence with a leucine-rich core segment. These extensions show striking similarities with the glycopeptide moiety (the so-called copeptin) present in mammalian vasopressin precursors, except that they lack the consensus sequence for N-glycosylation. These data suggest that mammalian copeptin is derived from the C terminus of an ancestral neurophysin.\r"

Specific oligonucleotide primers were designed from two regions of protein sequence and were combined in an amplification reaction with a single-stranded cDNA preparation derived from rat liver poly(A)+ RNA. Based upon mapping of the protein sequences 42 kDa apart on the MII polypeptide, the procedure was expected to generate an approximately 1150-base-pair amplification product representing a segment of the MII gene between the two primer regions. The size of the amplified product (1170 base pairs) was in close agreement with this predicted fragment size. The authenticity of the amplified fragment was confirmed by the agreement of the DNA sequence with additional protein sequence data. A 1474-base-pair clone was isolated from a cDNA library by plaque hybridization using the amplification fragment as a radiolabeled probe. The nucleotide sequence of this clone predicts a single continuous open reading frame and, based upon a polypeptide molecular mass of 117 kDa for the enzyme subunit, is consistent with the clone representing approximately 50% of the coding sequence of MII. Both the clone and the amplification product hybridized to a rat liver mRNA of approximately 8 kilobases, a message size approximately 4.7 kilobases larger than the size of the predicted open reading frame. This extensive non-coding information on the MII message is a feature common to two other Golgi processing enzymes, both of which contain most of the non-coding information on the 3' end of their messages. The function of these disproportionately large untranslated regions is not clear.\r"

This result is surprising when contrasted with the classical view that regards the alpha-helix as a marginally stable structure in H2O and considers short helices unstable. The alanine-based peptides are solubilized by insertion of three or more residues of a single charge type, lysine (+) or glutamic acid (-). The results cannot be explained by helix stabilization resulting from concentration-dependent association or by the interaction of charged residues with the helix dipole. Our results are not predicted by the parameters for alanine and lysine that have been determined by the \"host-guest\" method: these parameters predict that a 16-residue peptide should not show measurable alpha-helix formation. Analysis of the role of the hydrophobic interaction in alpha-helix formation [Richards, F.M. & Richmond, T. (1978) in Molecular Interactions and Activity in Proteins, Ciba Foundation Symposium 60, ed. Wolstenholme, G.E. (Excepta Medica Amsterdam), pp. 23-25] does not show an unusually strong hydrophobic interaction in a helical block of alanine residues. The likely explanation for our results is, therefore, that individual alanine residues have a high helical potential. It is not yet known whether any other amino acids show this property, and the origin of this property is also unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Mice treated with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, showed striking alterations of morphology of lung type 2 cell lamellar bodies (swelling and disintegration) and mitochondria (degeneration) and of lung capillary endothelial cells (mitochondrial swelling). These effects probably may be ascribed to glutathione deficiency; administration of glutathione monoester protects against them. Measurements of arteriovenous plasma glutathione levels across the lung indicate that the net uptake of glutathione by this organ is substantial. Thus, glutathione exported from the liver to the blood plasma is utilized by the lung which, like the liver, kidney, and lymphocytes (and unlike skeletal muscle), exhibits a high overall rate of glutathione turnover. Intraperitoneal injection of glutathione into buthionine sulfoximine-treated mice leads to very high levels of plasma glutathione without significant increase in the glutathione levels of liver, lung, and lymphocytes; on the other hand, administration of glutathione monoester leads to markedly increased tissue and mitochondrial levels of glutathione. Administration of glutathione monoester (in contrast to glutathione) to control mice also increases mitochondrial glutathione levels. The findings indicate that glutathione is required for mitochondrial integrity and that it probably also functions in the processing and storage of surfactant in lamellar bodies. The morphological changes observed after treatment with buthionine sulfoximine and their prevention by glutathione monoester as well as findings on glutathione metabolism indicate that this tripeptide plays an important role in the lung. The previously observed failure of buthionine sulfoximine-treated mice to gain weight is mainly due to glutathione deficiency in the intestinal mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the 5'-flanking sequences required for the transcriptional regulation of human epsilon-globin gene expression. A series of deletion mutants of the human epsilon-globin gene 5'-flanking sequences were constructed and linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Expression of these constructs was tested in HeLa cells and the human erythroleukemia K-562 cells. By measuring chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities and mRNA levels we found that the sequence between -177 and -392 base pairs (bp) relative to the mRNA initiation site exerts a negative effect on epsilon-globin promoter activity. This effect is more pronounced in HeLa cells compared with K-562 cells. To further characterize the negative control region we cloned the DNA sequence between -177 and -392 bp either 5' or 3' of the epsilon-globin promoter and in either orientation. Our data indicate that this negative control region inhibits the epsilon-globin promoter activity in a position- and orientation-independent manner, thus suggesting that it is a silencer. In addition, the silencer also inhibits the expression from the Herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter. Sequence comparison reveals that there are three short regions within the silencer that share extensive homology with those found in other negative control DNA elements. Our results therefore indicate that an upstream silencer element is present in the epsilon-globin gene and that it may play an important role in the control of epsilon-globin gene expression during development.\r"

We have previously characterized two human RAR (hRAR-alpha and hRAR-beta) cDNAs and have recently cloned their murine cognates (mRAR-alpha and mRAR-beta) together with a third RAR (mRAR-gamma) whose RNA was detected predominantly in skin, a well-known target for RA. mRAR-gamma cDNA was used here to clone its human counterpart (hRAR-gamma) from a T47D breast cancer cell cDNA library. Using a transient transfection assay in HeLa cells and a reporter gene harboring a synthetic RA responsive element, we demonstrate that hRAR-gamma cDNA indeed encodes a RA-inducible transcriptional trans-activator. Interestingly, comparisons of the amino acid sequences of all six human and mouse RARs indicate that the interspecies conservation of a given member of the RAR subfamily (either alpha, beta, or gamma) is much higher than the conservation of all three receptors within a given species. These observations indicate that RAR-alpha, -beta, and -gamma may perform specific functions. We show also that hRAR-gamma RNA is the predominant RAR RNA species in human skin, which suggests that hRAR-gamma mediates some of the retinoid effects in this tissue.\r"

  ".W": "A simple and accurate genomic primer extension method has been developed to detect ultraviolet footprinting patterns of regulatory protein-DNA interactions in mammalian genomic DNA. The technique can also detect footprinting or sequencing patterns introduced into genomic DNA by other methods. Purified genomic DNA, containing either damaged bases or strand breaks introduced by footprinting or sequencing reactions, is first cut with a convenient restriction enzyme to reduce its molecular weight. A highly radioactive single-stranded DNA primer that is complementary to a region of genomic DNA whose sequence or footprint one wishes to examine is then mixed with 50 micrograms of restriction enzyme-cut genomic DNA. The primer is approximately 100 bases long and contains 85 radioactive phosphates, each of specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol (1 Ci = 37 GBq). A simple and fast method for preparing such primers is described. Following brief heat denaturation at 100 degrees C, the solution of genomic DNA and primer is cooled to 74 degrees C and a second solution containing Taq polymerase (Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase) and the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates is added to initiate primer extension of genomic DNA. Taq polymerase extends genomic hybridized primer until its polymerization reaction is terminated either by a damaged base or strand break in genomic DNA or by the addition of dideoxynucleotide triphosphates in the polymerization reaction. The concurrent primer hybridization-extension reaction is terminated after 5 hr and unhybridized primer is digested away by mung bean nuclease. Primer-extended genomic DNA is then denatured and electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and radioactive primer extension products are revealed by autoradiography. By using this method we demonstrate that it is possible to footprint with ultraviolet light, in intact monkey cells, regulatory protein--DNA interactions along a single copy of a simian virus 40 viral genome integrated into the monkey genome.\r"

The first 29 amino acids deduced from the open reading frame correspond to a typical mitochondrial targeting leader sequence. The remaining 361 amino acids, starting at the N terminus with phenylalanine, represent the mature mitochondrial E1 alpha peptide. The cDNA has 43 base pairs in the 5' untranslated region and 210 base pairs in the 3' untranslated region, including a polyadenylylation signal and a short poly(A) tract. The nucleotide sequence of human liver E1 alpha cDNA was confirmed by the nucleotide sequences of three overlapping fragments generated from human liver and fibroblast RNA by reverse transcription and DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. This consensus nucleotide sequence of human liver E1 alpha cDNA resolves existing discrepancies among three previously reported human E1 alpha cDNAs and provides the unambiguous reference sequence needed for the characterization of genetic mutations in pyruvate dehydrogenase-deficient patients.\r"

  ".W": "Four mutant brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA3 transcripts, bearing single or double base changes in the 3'-CCAOH terminus of the tRNA-like structure, previously characterized as being deficient in vitro with respect to aminoacylation and replication activities, have now been assayed in vivo for their ability to replicate (in the presence of transcripts of wild-type RNA1 and -2) in barley protoplasts and plants. In tests conducted with protoplasts, irrespective of the time post-infection, all four mutants were fully viable, and the relative levels of both plus and minus strand replication for each mutant were similar to that of the wild type. Inoculation of barley plants with these mutants resulted in phenotypic symptoms and viral yields that were similar to those from wild-type infections. Analysis of each mutant progeny RNA3 indicated that the altered sequence at the 3' terminus was restored to that of wild type. These observations indicate that there is a rapid turnover and correction of the 3' termini of BMV RNAs in vivo. Such correction is commensurate with the action of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, but it differs from recombination processes that appear to be relatively infrequent for BMV RNA3. These results support the conclusion that the 3'-CCAOH termini of viral tRNA-like structures function analogously to telomeres of chromosomal DNA.\r"

  ".U": "89315795\r", 
  ".W": "Both naturally occurring and synthetic phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) molecules show the phenomenon of spontaneous vesiculation on jump in pH value. This method involves a transient increase in pH of smectic PtdOH dispersions to values between 10 and 12. Such a pH increase induces spontaneous vesiculation with the formation of small unilamellar vesicles of diameter less than 50 nm as shown by 31P NMR. Both high-resolution and broad-line 31P NMR were used to study the mechanism of this process. When the pH of unsonicated PtdOH dispersions is raised to pH 10-12, lipid molecules on the outer monolayer of the bilayer become fully ionized. The second pK value of PtdOH in bilayers is 8.6 +/- 0.3, determined by 31P NMR. PtdOH molecules on the inner monolayer remain partially protonated. 31P NMR provides unambiguous evidence that the \"pH-jump\" treatment produces a pH gradient across the PtdOH bilayer. The orientation of the pH gradient is such that the pH in the external medium is 3-5 pH units higher than the internal pH. Associated with the pH gradient is a transverse packing asymmetry: partially protonated PtdOH molecules in the inner layer of the bilayer are more tightly packed than fully ionized molecules present in the outer layer. The pH gradient generated by the pH jump is proposed as the energy source that drives the spontaneous formation of highly curved vesicles.\r"

  ".W": "Scanning tunneling microscope images of DNA molecules absorbed onto highly oriented pyrolytic graphite have been obtained. Three methods of deposition and sample preparation have been utilized. In the first method, a highly concentrated solution of DNA is sonicated, and a drop is deposited on freshly cleaved graphite. Under these conditions, the molecules tend to align in a parallel fashion, forming liquid-crystalline phases. In the second method, a solution of DNA is deposited directly on the graphite surface without sonication. In this case, ammonium acetate, a volatile salt, is used to decrease the amount of the residual salt crystals left after drying. In the third method, a solution containing lysed phage particles and DNA is adsorbed onto a graphite surface. The molecules are seen either isolated or in small bundles. The values of height, periodicity, and thickness observed and the handedness of the molecules are consistent with those expected for DNA. In all cases, the molecules were identified by their characteristic periodic structure and because, at higher magnification, no graphite-like structure was detectable on the surface of the molecules. Often the DNA molecules appear to adsorb in areas of the graphite that have many steps and defects. A mechanism that explains the magnitude of the tunneling currents measured in DNA is proposed. This mechanism, in turn, suggests a general method by which large insulating molecules can be rendered conductive.\r"

Positive tension was applied by stretching the fiber in rigor. Negative tension was applied in two steps by using a protocol introduced by Goldman et al. [Goldman, Y. E., McCray, J. A. & Vallette, D. P. (1988) J. Physiol. (London) 398, 75P]: relaxing a fiber at resting length and stretching it until the relaxed tension is appreciable and then placing the fiber in rigor and releasing the tension onto the rigor cross-bridges. We found, as have others, that positive tension has no effect on the fluorescence polarization spectrum from the SH1-bound probe, indicating that the cross-bridge does not rotate under these conditions. Negative tension, however, causes a change in the fluorescence polarization spectrum that indicates a probe rotation. The changes in the polarization spectrum from negative stress are partially reversed by the subsequent application of positive stress. It appears that negative tension strains the cross-bridge, or the cross-bridge domain containing SH1, and causes it to rotate.\r"

This suggests that hybrid cell-cell channels form in the oocyte system. Hybrid channels also form when a connexin-43 mRNA-injected oocyte is paired with a noninjected oocyte expressing endogenous connexin. The latter hybrids have properties apparently contributed by both types of hemichannels. Pure connexin-43 channels are not voltage gated, whereas pure oocyte channels are voltage dependent; hybrids of these channels rectify.\r"

There have been no direct measurements of the magnitude or direction of interstitial fluid flow in tissues to date. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we have measured interstitial fluid velocities and the diffusion coefficient of bovine serum albumin in normal and neoplastic tissues grown in a thin, transparent window in the ear of a rabbit. A well-defined laser beam was focused on a region within the interstitium of the fluorescence-bathed tissue. A short pulse of laser irradiation extinguished the fluorescence emanating from this selected region. The recovery of fluorescence due to diffusion and convection within the medium was monitored and analyzed to yield values of the diffusion coefficient and the fluid velocity. The average fluid velocity was about 0.6 microns/s, and albumin diffusion coefficients were 5.8 +/- 1.3 x 10(-7) cm2/s and 6.3 +/- 1.9 x 10(-7) cm2/s in normal and neoplastic tissues, respectively. The interstitial fluid flow, in general, was directed into postcapillary venules. The results obtained in this study should provide the impetus for further investigation into the diffusion and convection in various tissues under normal and pathological conditions.\r"

Constructs containing all four of the hypersensitive sites increase beta-globin mRNA levels 8- to 13-fold, while constructs with only the 5' or 3' sites increase globin expression to a lesser extent. No effect was seen when the constructs were assayed in 3T3 fibroblasts. All of the LAR derivatives form hypersensitive sites at the corresponding sequence position in MEL cells prior to and after induction of MEL cell differentiation. However, in 3T3 fibroblasts only the hypersensitive site corresponding to the previously described erythroid-specific -10.9 site was formed.\r"

Of the positive clones isolated, many encoded the same protein-tyrosine kinase, which we designate Cek1 (chicken embryo kinase 1). Its amino acid sequence suggests that the Cek1 protein is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase and presumably the receptor for an unknown ligand. Antibodies prepared to the cloned Cek1 kinase recognize, in immunoblotting experiments, two protein bands with apparent molecular weights of 100,000 and 110,000. The Cek1 protein was detected in many chicken embryonic tissues, but not in the corresponding adult tissues (with the exception of brain). The Cek1 kinase appears to be very closely related to two protein-tyrosine kinases whose partial sequences have been recently determined, human Flg and mouse Bek. Cloning using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies has allowed us to detect, in addition to Cek1, several other protein-tyrosine kinases that are expressed during chicken embryonic development, some of which have not been previously identified.\r"

  ".W": "The baboon has at least five alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH; alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.1) and has distinct liver and kidney class I isozymes. A rat liver class I ADH partial cDNA was used to screen a baboon liver cDNA library. A cDNA clone was isolated and sequenced and found to contain the entire coding region for baboon liver ADH, 12 nucleotides of the 5' noncoding region, and 256 nucleotides of the 3' noncoding region. The amino acid sequence deduced from this cDNA most closely resembles that of human liver ADH beta subunit (ADH-beta): 363 of 374 residues were identical. This suggested that baboon liver class I ADH is of the same ancestral lineage as the human ADH-beta. In contrast to human liver, only a single ADH-beta transcript is observed in baboon liver. A comparison of human and baboon ADH 3' noncoding regions suggests that a single nucleotide change in a polyadenylylation signal consensus sequence may, in part, be responsible for the generation of ADH-beta transcripts with variable-length 3' ends in human liver. A nucleotide substitution rate of 0.5 x 10(-9) substitutions per site per year for primate class I ADH genes was deduced from the data, which suggests that the alpha-beta gamma separation of human ADH genes occurred about 60 million years ago, and that primate class I ADH gene duplications predated primate radiation.\r"

We present evidence that this primordial cluster arose by local gene duplications of homeoboxes that were present before the divergence of arthropods and chordates. Sequence analyses indicate that the expansion of the primordial gene cluster complex was accompanied by diversification, whereas conservation predominated after the duplications of entire homeobox gene clusters.\r"

We have analyzed the conservation of the segmentation genes Kruppel (Kr) and even-skipped (eve) in parallel with sal coding sequences in several Drosophila species that are evolutionarily separated by up to 60 million years. To our surprise, sal sequences appear to be conserved in the Sophophora subgenus of the Drosophila genus but not in the Drosophila subgenus. On the other hand, the segmentation and other homeotic genes are conserved in the Drosophila subgroup as well. Our data suggest that sal encodes an accessory function that evolved relatively late during Drosophila speciation rather than playing a fundamental evolutionary role similar to that of other homeotic genes.\r"

  ".W": "The Mlvi-1/mis-1/pvt-1 locus, located approximately 270 kilobase pairs 3' of the c-myc protooncogene, was originally discovered as a common region of provirus integration in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced rat T-cell lymphomas. The same locus was shown subsequently to be coamplified with c-myc and to be involved in chromosomal translocations in a variety of human and animal neoplasms. Provirus integration in Mlvi-1 in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced rat T-cell lymphomas activates the c-myc protooncogene. The studies reported here were aimed to determine whether, in addition to the activation of c-myc, provirus integration affected the expression of other neighboring genes. Provirus integration was shown to occur in three clusters separated by regions of uninterrupted DNA. The proviruses in all three clusters had integrated in a single-transcriptional orientation, and they appeared intact. Systematic hybridization of Mlvi-1 clones to rat, mouse, and human genomic DNA revealed three patches of evolutionarily conserved sequences. Two of them were mapped in regions targeted by the provirus, and the third was mapped immediately 5' to the provirus clusters. A probe derived from the conserved sequences 5' of the integrated proviruses detected a tumor-specific RNA transcript in tumors carrying a provirus in Mlvi-1 or in the neighboring Mlvi-4 and c-myc loci. The highest level of RNA transcript expression, however, was seen in a CD4+ CD8+ tumor cell line that was not carrying a provirus in this region. We conclude that provirus insertion in this region activates both c-myc and another gene that is located in the immediate vicinity of the integrated Mlvi-1 proviruses and may be developmentally regulated in T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Complete inactivation of the human retinoblastoma gene (RB) is believed to be an essential step in tumorigenesis of several different cancers. To provide a framework for understanding inactivation mechanisms, the structure of RB was delineated. The RB transcript is encoded in 27 exons dispersed over about 200 kilobases (kb) of genomic DNA. The length of individual exons ranges from 31 to 1889 base pairs (bp). The largest intron spans greater than 60 kb and the smallest one has only 80 bp. Deletion of exons 13-17 is frequently observed in various types of tumors, including retinoblastoma, breast cancer, and osteosarcoma, and the presence of a potential \"hot spot\" for recombination in the region is predicted. A putative \"leucine-zipper\" motif is exclusively encoded by exon 20. The detailed RB structure presented here should prove useful in defining potential functional domains of its encoded protein. Transcription of RB is initiated at multiple positions and the sequences surrounding the initiation sites have a high G + C content. A typical upstream TATA box is not present. Localization of the RB promoter region was accomplished by utilizing a heterologous expression system containing a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Deletion analysis revealed that a region as small as 70 bp is sufficient for RB promoter activity, similar to other previously characterized G + C-rich gene promoters. Several direct repeats and possible stem-and-loop structures are found in the promoter region. No enhancer element was detected within the 7.3 kb of upstream sequence studied. Several features of the RB promoter are reminiscent of the characteristics associated with many \"housekeeping\" genes, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern.\r"

  ".W": "For isolation of the gene responsible for xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group A, plasmid pSV2gpt and genomic DNA from a mouse embryo were cotransfected into XP2OSSV cells, a group-A XP cell line. Two primary UV-resistant XP transfectants were isolated from about 1.6 X 10(5) pSV2gpt-transformed XP colonies. pSV2gpt and genomic DNA from the primary transfectants were again cotransfected into XP2OSSV cells and a secondary UV-resistant XP transfectant was obtained by screening about 4.8 X 10(5) pSV2gpt-transformed XP colonies. The secondary transfectant retained fewer mouse repetitive sequences. A mouse gene that complements the defect of XP2OSSV cells was cloned into an EMBL3 vector from the genome of a secondary transfectant. Transfections of the cloned DNA also conferred UV resistance on another group-A XP cell line but not on XP cell lines of group C, D, F, or G. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA with a subfragment of cloned mouse DNA repair gene as the probe revealed that an approximately 1.0 kilobase mRNA was transcribed in the donor mouse embryo and secondary transfectant, and approximately 1.0- and approximately 1.3-kilobase mRNAs were transcribed in normal human cells, but none of these mRNAs was detected in three strains of group-A XP cells. These results suggest that the cloned DNA repair gene is specific for group-A XP and may be the mouse homologue of the group-A XP human gene.\r"

  ".W": "To study the molecular basis for antibody diversity and the structural basis for antigen binding, we have characterized the loss of phosphocholine (P-Cho) binding both experimentally and computationally in U10, a somatic mutant of the antibody S107. Nucleotide sequencing of U10 shows a single base change in JH1, substituting Asp-101 with Ala, over 9 A distant from the P-Cho-binding pocket. Probing with antiidiotypic antibodies suggests local, not global, conformational changes. Computational results support a specific structural mechanism for the loss of P-Cho binding. The U10 mutation eliminates the charged interaction between Asp-101 and Arg-94, which allows the Arg-94 side chain to disrupt P-Cho binding sterically and electrostatically by folding into the P-Cho-binding site. These results specifically show the importance of the Arg-94 to Asp-101 side chain salt bridge in the heavy-chain CDR3 conformation and suggest that residues distant from the binding site play an important role in antibody diversity and inducible complementarity.\r"

  ".W": "Murine sex-limited protein (Slp) is an isotype of murine complement component C4 that shares 95% sequence identity with C4 as well as the intramolecular thioester necessary for C4 function but has no complement activity. Slp is nonfunctional at least in part because it is not cleaved by the activated form of complement protease C1s (C1s), which proteolytically activates C4 in the classical complement pathway. Slp is also distinct from C4 in that its expression in some mouse strains is under testosterone control. In the present studies, we used site-directed mutagenesis of C4 and expression of the mutant proteins in cultured cells to identify the amino acid substitutions in Slp that are responsible for resistance to C1s cleavage. We focused on sequence changes immediately downstream of the cleavage site in C4 because the arginine at that site is conserved in Slp, but the downstream sequences diverge substantially, with six differences in the first 7 residues followed by a 3-residue deletion in Slp. We found that a C4 mutant carrying only the 3-residue deletion is not cleaved by C1s and has essentially no hemolytic activity, whereas a mutant carrying only the six replacement changes is cleaved by C1s and has normal hemolytic activity. Both mutants have intact thioesters. A third mutant in which two acidic residues in the segment deleted in Slp were replaced by aliphatic residues is also cleaved by C1s, has an intact thioester group, and has normal hemolytic activity. These results indicate that the downstream mutations are responsible for the resistance of Slp to C1s cleavage and suggest that the length rather than the specific sequence of this segment is critical in determining susceptibility to the protease.\r"

  ".W": "Metabolic changes following estrogen stimulation and the inhibition of these changes in the presence of actinomycin D and cycloheximide were monitored continuously in perfused human breast cancer T47D clone 11 cells with 31P and 13C NMR techniques. The experiments were performed by estrogen rescue of tamoxifen-treated cells. Immediately after perfusion with estrogen-containing medium, a continuous enhancement in the rates of glucose consumption, lactate production by glycolysis, and glutamate synthesis by the Krebs cycle occurred with a persistent 2-fold increase at 4 hr. The content of phosphocholine had increased by 10% to 30% within the first hour of estrogen stimulation, but the content of the other observed phosphate metabolites as well as the pH remained unchanged. Pretreatment with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide, at concentrations known to inhibit mRNA and protein synthesis, respectively, and simultaneous treatment with estrogen and each inhibitor prevented the estrogen-induced changes in glucose metabolism. This suggested that the observed estrogen stimulation required synthesis of mRNA and protein. These inhibitors also modulated several metabolic activities that were not related to estrogen stimulation. The observed changes in the in vivo kinetics of glucose metabolism may provide a means for the early detection of the response of human breast cancer cells to estrogen versus tamoxifen treatment.\r"

Therefore, a direct effect of HIV on megakaryocytes was investigated. The bone marrow of HIV seropositive individuals was analyzed ultrastructurally, and the megakaryocytes of 10 thrombocytopenic patients were subjected to in situ hybridization with a HIV RNA probe. The structural aberrations in HIV megakaryocytes were distinct from those in HIV-negative immune thrombocytopenias, and the megakaryocytes of 10 of 10 patients examined by in situ hybridization unambiguously expressed viral RNA. Therefore, it is likely that direct infection of megakaryocytes with HIV-1 is one mechanism for the decrease in platelet production.\r"

The four compounds differ in their stereochemistry of the 5,6 double bond and/or the 15-hydroxyl group. Only 10,10-difluoro-TXA2 (compound I) with the natural stereochemistry of TXA2 was an agonist in both platelets and canine saphenous veins (EC50 = 36 +/- 3.6 nM and 3.7 +/- 0.8 nM, respectively). (15R)-10,10-Difluoro-TXA2 (compound II), (5E)-10,10-difluoro-TXA2 (compound III), and (5E,15R)-10,10-difluoro-TXA2 (compound IV) were antagonists of platelet aggregation stimulated by compound I (Kd = 98 +/- 46 nM, 140 +/- 42 nM, and 1450 +/- 350 nM, respectively). However, compounds II, III, and IV stimulated contraction of canine saphenous veins (EC50 = 36 +/- 4.4 nM, 31 +/- 6.8 nM, and 321 +/- 50 nM, respectively).

These results support the existence of two subtypes of TXA2/prostaglandin H2 receptors and emphasize the importance of the stereochemical requirements of these TXA2 analogues for interaction with these receptors. These stable fluorinated TXA2 analogues should prove useful tools for the further characterization of these and other TXA2/prostaglandin H2 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The UV components of sunlight are believed to be a major cause of human skin cancer, and DNA is thought to be the principal molecular target. Alterations of the intensity and wavelength distribution of solar UV radiation reaching the surface of the earth, for example by depletion of stratospheric ozone, will change the effectiveness of solar radiation in damaging DNA in human skin. Evaluation of the magnitude of such effects requires knowledge of the altered sunlight spectrum and of the action spectrum for damaging DNA in human skin. We have determined an action spectrum for the frequency of pyrimidine dimer formation induced in the DNA of human skin per unit dose of UV incident on the skin surface. The peak of this action spectrum is near 300 nm and decreases rapidly at both longer and shorter wavelengths. The decrease in our action spectrum for wavelengths less than 300 nm is attributed to the absorption of the upper layers of the skin, an in situ effect that is inherently included in our measurements. Convolution of the dimer action spectrum with the solar spectra corresponding to a solar angle of 40 degrees under current levels of stratospheric ozone (0.32-cm O3 layer) and those for 50% ozone depletion (0.16-cm O3 layer), indicate about a 2.5-fold increase in dimer formation. If the action spectrum for DNA damage that results in skin cancer resembles that for dimer induction in skin, our results, combined with epidemiological data, suggest that a 50% decrease in stratospheric ozone would increase the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers among white males in Seattle, Washington, by 7.5- to 8-fold, to a higher incidence than is presently seen in the corresponding population of Albuquerque, New Mexico.\r"

Eleven of 11 male founder mice, but only 2 of 12 females, died between 3 to 4 mo of age. Death was associated with presence of tumors at or near the squamocolumnar junction of the stomach. Microscopically, these multifocal tumors appeared to arise from hyperplastic epithelium and showed features consistent with adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma. High levels of expression of both the Ad12 E1A and E1B genes were seen in the tumor-bearing stomach. Various levels of expression were also detected in other tissues, although the stomach was the only organ with detectable pathology. These observations suggest an organ-specific action of the Ad12 early region 1 gene products. This transgenic mouse model provides an experimental system for studying the development of human carcinomas at sites of transition from squamous to columnar epithelium.\r"

During virus replication, seven subgenomic mRNAs are generated by what is thought to be a leader-priming mechanism to form a 3'-coterminal nested set. By using radiolabeled, strand-specific, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probes in RNA blot hybridization analyses, we have found a minus-strand counterpart for the genome and for each subgenomic mRNA species in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Subgenomic minus strands were found to be components of double-stranded replicative forms and in numbers that surpass full-length antigenome. We propose that subgenomic mRNA replication, in addition to leader-primed transcription, is a significant mechanism of mRNA synthesis and that it functions to amplify mRNAs. It is a mechanism of amplification that has not been described for any other group of RNA viruses. Subgenomic replicons may also function in a manner similar to genomes of defective interfering viruses to lead to the establishment of persistent infections, a universal property of coronaviruses.\r"

By using immunocytochemistry, PEP-19 is shown to be localized to several regions of the central nervous system, notably cerebellum, thalamus caudate putamen, and olfactory bulb. We have isolated a 0.5-kilobase cDNA clone that encodes the entire PEP-19 protein sequence, making this one of the smallest primary transcripts and translation products ever identified in eukaryotes. The cDNA was used to investigate the developmental expression of PEP-19 in rodent brain. PEP-19 mRNA rises from low levels at embryonic day 17 of gestation in the rat to a plateau value by day 18 postpartum. This mirrored the levels of the protein determined by radioimmunoassay. Since the rise coincided with the formation of synaptic contacts onto Purkinje cells (a major site of PEP-19 expression), the hypothesis was tested that the activity and/or presence of afferent input modulated PEP-19 expression. Parallel fiber innervation was disrupted either by killing granule cells with the cytostatic agent methylazoxymethanol or by examining PEP-19 levels in cerebellar granuloprival mutant mice (reeler and weaver). The influence of climbing fiber input was assessed by either eliminating them with 3-acetylpyridine or stimulating them with harmaline in both neonatal and mature rats. None of the above altered PEP-19 gene expression in cerebellum, leading us to propose that the signals triggering the PEP-19 gene do not emanate from granule cells or neurons in the olivary nucleus. However, preliminary evidence suggests that PEP-19 is under posttranscriptional regulation.\r"

In order to visualize the behavior of the vertebrate synaptic vesicles in situ, synaptic vesicles isolated from rat brain were labeled with a fluorescent dye (Texas red) and injected into the presynaptic terminal of the squid giant synapse. The pattern of fluorescence that would result from passive diffusion was determined by coinjection of an unconjugated fluorescent dye (fluorescein). The patterns obtained with fluorescent synaptic vesicles were strikingly different from that obtained by simple diffusion of fluorescein. Although the fluorescein diffused freely in both directions, the vesicles moved preferentially into the terminal--i.e., toward the release sites--at a rate of 0.5 microns/sec. The final distribution of the injected fluorescent synaptic vesicles displayed a discrete localization that suggested a distribution coincident with the active zones of the presynaptic terminal. Like fast axonal transport, but unlike fluorescein movements in the terminal, the vesicle movement was energy dependent, since the addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol blocked the redistribution of vesicles completely. In addition, reduction of extracellular calcium concentration reversibly blocked vesicular movement as well. In conclusion, mammalian synaptic vesicles retain the cytoplasmic surface components necessary for translocation, sorting, and targeting to the proper locations by the native machinery of the squid giant synapse.\r"

  ".W": "We reported in previous studies that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has central effects of augmenting wakefulness and suppressing slow-wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS) in rats. In the present study, we tested the effect of AH 6809, an antagonist of PGE2 receptors, on sleep-wake activities. AH 6809 in saline was infused continuously into the third ventricle of freely moving rats at a rate of 2.1, 6.3, and 21 pmol/min from 2300 to 0500 hr. During the infusion at 21 pmol/min, wakefulness decreased to 82%, and SWS and PS increased to 122% and 161%, of the respective baseline values. These changes can be explained by AH 6809 antagonizing the endogenous PGE2 that acts to augment wakefulness in the brain. This explanation is supported by the fact that the infusion of AH 6809 at 21 pmol/min inhibited the wakefulness-promoting effect of PGE2 infused at 10 pmol/min. Moreover, the PGE2-related mechanisms for regulating sleep-wake activities may be different from those producing hyperthermia, because AH 6809 at 21 pmol/min had no primary effect on brain temperature and did not antagonize the hyperthermia produced by the PGE2 infusion. A diurnal infusion (1200 to 1800 hr) of AH 6809 at 21 pmol/min produced similar effects on sleep-wake activities compared with the nocturnal infusion (2300 to 0500 hr), although the PS increase was not significant, suggesting that the PGE2-related mechanisms are acting all day long with or without a circadian rhythm. These findings strongly suggest that endogenous PGE2 in the brain is involved in the physiological mechanisms for regulating sleep-wake activities.\r"

Seventeen patients with CF hospitalized (means length of stay = 13.0 +/- 2.6 days) for an acute exacerbation of their pulmonary disease participated in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to either a group that participated in two cycle ergometer exercise sessions and one bronchial hygiene treatment session per day (EX Group [n = 9]) or a group that participated in three bronchial hygiene treatment sessions per day (PD Group [n = 8]). Pulmonary functions and responses to a progressive, incremental cycle ergometer exercise test were measured on admission and before discharge. Bronchial hygiene therapy consisted of postural drainage, in six positions, with chest percussion and vibration. Therapeutic exercise was of moderate intensity and was individually adjusted based on the patient's heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation response to the admission exercise test. Coughing was encouraged during and after all treatments. Pulmonary function and exercise response were significantly improved over the period of hospitalization in both groups; the improvements were the same in the two groups. These results indicate that, in some hospitalized patients with CF, exercise therapy may be substituted for at least part of the standard protocol of bronchial hygiene therapy.\r"

Fourteen healthy volunteers without any observable gait deviations participated in the study. The subjects (8 male, 6 female) ranged in age from 19 to 56 years. Lower extremity lateral dominance was determined using an assessment method developed by Carol Coogler. Retroreflective spherical markers were placed bilaterally at points over the greater trochanter, the lateral joint line of the knee, the lateral malleolus, and the metatarsal break. A video-based data-acquisition instrument interfaced with a PDP 11/73 computer measured 12 kinematic variables while the subjects walked at self-selected speeds along a 10-m walkway. A multivariate analysis of variance with one repeated measure revealed significant differences between limbs, across subjects, for stance time and maximum knee extension. A within-subject analysis demonstrated significant differences for 10 variables; however, lateral dominance could not be related predictably to these variations. Our results indicate that symmetry cannot be generalized in view of intrasubject variability for these variables.

The total internal moment developed about the ankle joint during locomotion and the passive component of this internal moment were measured. The contributions of the active and passive components were expressed as the ratio (R) between the passive moment and the total internal moment. Measurements were compared for 13 children with CP and 5 healthy children. For the data analysis, the children with CP, exhibiting apparently similar toe-walking, were divided into two groups: 1) Group CPI and 2) Group CPII. Group CPI was characterized by a small ratio R value, which indicated the presence of excessive contractions of the triceps surae muscle during locomotion. In Group CPII, the ratio R value was abnormally high, which indicated that a contracture (ie, structural change of the muscle or the tendon) was entirely or at least partly responsible for toe-walking. Each group requires a different therapeutic strategy.\r"

Eighteen subjects with LLDs ranging from 4.8 to 22.2 mm participated in this study. Subject age range was from 20 to 63 years. A force platform was used to obtain ground reaction force data for four conditions. Data were collected prior to fitting of the heel lift and after a three-week break-in period. Data were analyzed by use of a two-factor within-subject analysis of variance for repeated measures. Before heel-lift fitting, maximum lateral force was greater in the short leg than in the long leg. After heel-lift fitting, maximum vertical force was greater within both legs, and maximum medical force was greater in the long leg than in the short leg. The results suggest that although heel lifts are used to achieve pelvic levelness, the use of heel lifts also resulted in increased ground reaction forces, which may cause increased joint stresses within the lower extremities.\r"

In experiment 1, infrared light-emitting diodes (IREDs) were placed at the axis and along the arms of a clinical goniometer. Twelve angles in 5-degree increments were each recorded 10 times at each of three spatial locations. Reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and analysis-of-variance procedures to determine within-trial variability. The ICCs for all spatial locations exceeded .99. The 95% confidence interval for each angle was less than 0.5 degree in all cases. Criterion-referenced instrument validity was assessed with regression analysis. Slopes of the regression of reconstructed angle on reference angle were close to unity for each spatial location. A systematic error, however, that increased as the goniometer was rotated 45 degrees away from the cameras was evident. In experiment 2, a robotic arm was fitted with four IREDs and made to repeat a defined movement trajectory 10 times at each of three spatial locations. The ICCs for portions of each trajectory ranged from .20 to .99. The results show that reliable and valid results can be obtained from this motion analysis system if adequate precautions are taken to reduce unwanted light reflections. Reliability and validity decreased somewhat as the object was rotated further away from the plane in which the cameras were mounted.\r"

  ".W": "This communication is in response to the article by Michael T Gross and Charles P Schuch entitled \"Exercise Programs for Patients with Post-Polio Syndrome: A Case Report\" published in the January 1989 issue of Physical Therapy. The investigators examined the effects of a rigorous isokinetic training program on peak torque of the knee flexor and extensor muscles of a post-polio patient. The literature on post-polio syndrome, however, does not support the use of either conventional muscle strengthening regimens or rigorous isokinetic exercise programs in the management of post-polio syndrome. In addition, based on the observation that there was no appreciable increase in muscle strength in either the affected or the apparently unaffected leg, the investigators concluded that their rigorous exercise program was not deleterious. The lack of a normal training response, however, is consistent with bilateral muscle fatigue secondary to overuse rather than muscle weakness secondary to disuse. This result is consistent with the need for a balance between rest and low-intensity exercise, which will help to maintain or enhance function while slowing rather than hastening further deterioration. We hope that this rejoinder clarifies some of the misconceptions that may arise from the Gross and Schuch article and that physical therapists consider very carefully the rationale for any type of exercise program for post-polio patients.\r"

Lining flaps from such intranasal tissues are thin, vascular, and flexible. They allow the use of primary cartilage grafts and the establishment of a subsurface architecture in the shape of a nose. When visualized through a conforming forehead flap, the normal landmarks and highlights are restored. In cases of total nasal amputation, a pivoting septal flap permits the fabrication of dorsal nasal support weeks before lining and cover flaps are assembled.\r"

All patients had computed tomography (CT) with axial and coronal sections that revealed three fracture patterns of the orbital roof (nondisplaced, superiorly displaced, and inferiorly displaced fractures). Orbital dystopia was exhibited in 35 percent (N = 8) of the patients. Exophthalmos was noted in 61 percent (N = 14) of the patients. Only 30 percent of the patients (N = 7) sustained associated maxillofacial fractures. Eight percent of fractures exhibited orbital encephaloceles. All patients lacked frontal sinus pneumatization. The majority of children with orbital roof fractures do not exhibit concomitant facial fractures. CT utilizing both axial and coronal sections is valuable in defining the extent and pattern of the fracture as well as in identifying associated neurologic injuries. Large, displaced orbital roof fractures, which occurred in 3 of 13 patients with displaced fractures in our series, should undergo early reduction to avoid late development of encephalocele.\r"

The use of this material in the experimental and clinical settings for maxillofacial onlay grafting has been recently described. This study was designed to quantitate the rate of vascularization of coralline hydroxyapatite when used in an onlay application to membranous bone in an animal model. Sixteen onlay grafts of coralline hydroxyapatite (0.5 X 0.5 X 1.0 cm Interpore 200) were placed in a subperiosteal location on the nasal dorsum of 2- to 3-kg male New Zealand white rabbits. The grafts and nasal bones were harvested en bloc at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after onlay. Prior to harvest, injectable silicone visualizing agent (Microfil*) was injected by means of carotid artery cutdown. The decalcified specimens were examined on a digitizing pad to count the number of vessels appearing in the blocks of hydroxyapatite. Counting was summed and integrated by an Apple IIe microcomputer. A significant difference (p less than 0.05) was noted in both the number of vessels and the fraction of implants infiltrated by vessels between 1 and 4 weeks. The usefulness of these previously undescribed data may be in their extrapolation to onlay grafts of coralline hydroxyapatite in maxillofacial reconstruction in humans.\r"

A study was made in the facial regions of 14 cadavers, and a comparison was made to descriptions found in the anatomic literature. It was confirmed in our dissections that the buccal artery, which reaches the posterior half of the muscle, is the major arterial pedicle of the buccinator and that it runs very close to the buccal nerve. Several veins originating from the lateral aspect of the muscle make the venous drainage of the buccinator even richer than its arterial supply. The abundant vascular supply from multiple interconnected pedicles supports the blood supply of the buccal mucosa. The motor innervation of the buccinator muscle comes from the facial nerve. The buccinator is considered to be a part of the sphincteric muscular system involving the functions of sucking, whistling, propelling food during mastication, and voiding the buccal cavity. The flap was utilized clinically in 38 patients: 24 to close primary cleft palates that required palate lengthening, 12 to close palatal fistulas, 1 to treat a mandibular osteitis, and 1 to repair the palate after tumor resection. We had three small fistulas as complications in our series owing to technical mistakes.\r"

Direct in vivo observations were made in an isolated microcirculatory bed lying directly downstream from a newly made anastomosis. The tissue used was the isolated rat cremaster muscle, a new experimental model. The vessel anastomosed was the external iliac artery. Following anastomosis, microemboli were clearly observed in eight of eight animals during the first 30 minutes after clamp release. Embolic events were sometimes of impressive magnitude and in one case were associated with cessation of blood flow throughout the preparation. No microemboli were observed in eight of eight animals subjected only to dissection of the cremaster, nor were any observed in eight of eight animals in which the isolated cremaster was subjected only to 2 hours of clamp ischemia. These findings may be significant in explaining perturbations to blood flow following free-tissue transfer and instances of partial tissue necrosis following apparently successful arterial repair. These findings also identify an important factor (microemboli) to be considered in research on reperfusion injury.\r"

The former unit carries a reliable blood supply from the thoracodorsal artery and is able to cover deeper recipient defects, while the latter provides a well-contoured reconstruction of the defect. If needed, an extended portion and/or a thin cutaneous flap can be carried along with the flap according to the defect. In our clinic, we have so far used four pedicled and one free reduced latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap in the repair of a variety of defects. All flaps survived, and satisfactory contour of the recipient site was achieved in each case. These clinical experiences clarify that a reduced portion 10 cm in length can be safely carried, and it is suggested that survival of this flap does not depend on its width-to-length ratio.\r"

  ".W": "Skin flaps constructed on expanded skin usually include the underlying capsular tissue. It has been hypothesized that capsulectomy may jeopardize the viability of the expanded skin flap. The experiments reported herein were designed to test this hypothesis. Specifically, we studied the hemodynamics and viability of random-pattern skin flaps (8 X 20 cm) raised on delayed bipedicle flaps (group A) and on expanded skin pockets with capsulectomy at the time of flap elevation (group B) or with intact underlying capsular tissue (group C). Each group was randomly assigned to each flank in 16 pigs. Skin pockets were expanded by inflation of subcutaneous silicone tissue expanders with sterile saline (299 +/- 7 ml; X +/- SEM) over a period of 3 weeks. At the end of this period, the bipedicle flaps were constructed. Eight days later, random-pattern skin flaps were raised on bipedicle flaps and skin pockets. The length and area of skin flap viability, judged by the fluorescein dye test performed 1 day postoperatively, were not significantly different (p greater than 0.05) among groups A, B, and C (n = 31 to 32). There also were no significant differences (p greater than 0.05) in total skin capillary blood flow measured 1 day postoperatively (A = 2.6 +/- 0.4, B = 2.4 +/- 0.4, and C = 2.7 +/- 0.6 ml/min per flap; n = 15 to 16) and in skin viability assessed 7 days postoperatively (A = 74 +/- 2, B = 75 +/- 2, and C = 76 +/- 2 percent; n = 16) among delayed skin flaps and skin flaps raised on expanded skin pockets with or without capsulectomy. The results of this flap viability study were confirmed in 5 minipigs in a separate experiment. We conclude that capsulectomy did not have a detrimental effect on the hemodynamics and viability of random-pattern skin flaps raised on expanded skin. Furthermore, we hypothesize that skin flaps raised on expanded skin are similar to delayed skin flaps in that the skin blood flow is optimally augmented; therefore, the capsular tissue does not add significant blood supply to the overlying skin.\r"

The author's one-stage technique, first published in 1974, is described with intraoperative illustrations, and the results obtained in nine patients are discussed. The advantages of the technique are preservation of a clitoral glans with erogenous sensation based exclusively on the deep dorsal neurovascular bundle. The glans of the megaloclitoris is obliquely reduced in size at its base toward the ventral surface and by resection of up to two-thirds of the ventral segment. It is relocated at its anatomic female position. The labia minora and the introitus vaginae are reconstructed at the same stage with the skin of the megaloclitoris displaced in posterior direction after a cutback incision. Dispareunia is prevented by total excision of the corpora cavernosa, including the crura.\r"

A mediastinal tracheostomy was avoided by using a tubed pectoralis major myocutaneous flap to replace the ablated trachea. The flap, transferred into the mediastinum subclavicularly, was connected to the tracheal stump and exteriorized as a cervical tracheostomy. This resulted in direct closure of the donor site and primary healing. Four years after the operation, the patient remains free of disease and is tolerating the neotrachea without difficulty or complications. The technique described is offered as an alternative to conventional mediastinal tracheostomy methods, which have acknowledged shortcomings.\r"

Botulinum neurotoxin causes a muscle paralysis lasting for approximately 3 months, and it is well established as the preferred treatment for blepharospasm. A case is presented in which botulinum toxin type A was injected into the opposite functioning frontalis muscle of a patient with unilateral frontal nerve paralysis. The patient experienced satisfactory relief of the asymmetry caused by onesided forehead wrinkling and brow elevation. Botulinum toxin therapy should be considered for both temporary and permanent facial asymmetries due to facial nerve paralysis as well as spasm.\r"

  ".W": "Between December 1986 and October 1988, 83 patients with chronic peripheral artery occlusions were treated with a new technique. In 56 patients, the superficial femoral artery was completely occluded; in 21 patients, the popliteal artery; and in six patients, the iliac artery. The length of occlusion ranged from 5 to 35 cm (mean, 12.5 cm). The duration, estimated by history, was 5-48 months (mean, 16.5 months). In seven patients, durations of 6-36 months were documented angiographically. A flexible, blunt, motor-driven rotating catheter was introduced through an 8-F sheath, and rotational angioplasty was performed at low speed (up to 200 rpm). In 49 of 60 (82%) patients in whom this new technique was used as the primary intervention, the occlusions were successfully reopened. In 23 patients in whom conventional methods had failed more than 4 weeks earlier, the success rate for rotational angioplasty was 67% (12 of 18 patients); when the time interval was less than 4 weeks, only one of five patients was treated successfully. In none of the 83 patients did a perforation occur. This new technique can reopen chronic artery occlusions with a high degree of success and without the danger of vessel-wall perforation, even after failure of conventional techniques.\r"

Complete control of the hemorrhage was achieved in 74 patients, partial control in 23, and no control in 11. Seventy patients experienced postembolization syndrome (nausea, vomiting, gluteal pain, and fever due to tissue necrosis), and three had transient acute tubular necrosis caused by the contrast medium. It is important for success that the embolization be bilateral and that the embolic agent used be a permanent one.\r"

Those findings were obtained with use of the thrombin time as a test and platelet-poor plasma as a thrombin substrate. The authors confirmed these findings with use of a whole-blood version of the same test. However, the thrombin time measures only the final stages of the clotting process. A measure of the entire intrinsic pathway would more nearly simulate the situation in the angiographic suite. When measured with such an assay, the anticoagulant potency of ioxaglate was equivalent to that of diatrizoate and was approximately four times that of iopamidol and iohexol. Because of this difference in potency, it seemed likely that the ionic agents were inhibiting the clotting cascade at a late stage as well as at an earlier stage. To investigate this possibility, whole blood-contrast agent mixtures were activated, incubated for several minutes, and then diluted with either citrated or heparinized whole blood. There was rapid clot formation when the unclotted iopamidol and iohexol mixtures were diluted with citrated whole blood but not when they were diluted with heparinized whole blood. The ionic mixtures did not clot in the presence of either anticoagulant. Thus, in unclottable mixtures nonionic agents still permitted the generation of procoagulants. These procoagulants are theoretically capable of causing clotting on reinjection.\r"

It is demonstrated in this study that the substitution of more RF pulses, with their relative amplitudes distributed according to the binomial sequence, results in sharper stripes. This permits the use of a two-dimensional grid of stripes for more detailed studies of heart wall motion and provides a unique method of analyzing regional ventricular myocardial strain.\r"

To overcome this problem, a series of breath-hold, two-dimensional, flow-compensated gradient-echo images were acquired. These images were then processed by means of the maximum intensity projection algorithm to produce projection angiograms. The method was evaluated in 10 healthy subjects and in 12 patients and validated by comparing conventional angiograms, contrast material-enhanced computed tomographic scans, and duplex sonograms with MR projection arteriograms and venograms of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The aorta and pulmonary arteries and their branches were demonstrated, as was detailed anatomy of the hepatic and portal venous systems and inferior vena cava. Renal arteries and veins could be studied in both native and transplanted kidneys. The method permits determination of flow direction and differentiation of arteries and veins and is superior to three-dimensional acquisition techniques for imaging slow blood flow. Initial results suggest that the method may have clinical applications for a variety of vascular disorders.\r"

Thirty-three patients without postoperative complications underwent MR imaging in a 0.35-T unit 1 week after graft implantation, and 13 of those patients were reexamined 2-3 months after graft implantation. Twenty-four patients with clinically suspected perigraft infection underwent MR imaging 6 weeks to 18 years after graft implantation. Early normal postoperative changes were characterized by a perigraft collar of low to medium signal intensity on T1-weighted images and of high intensity on T2-weighted images in all 33 cases, consistent with perigraft fluid collection. In 10 of 13 patients reexamined 2-3 months postoperatively, the MR images demonstrated a collar of tissue consistent with perigraft fibrosis. In cases of clinical suspicion of retroperitoneal graft infection, MR imaging showed eccentric fluid collections of low to medium signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high intensity on T2-weighted images at more than 3 months after surgery. The MR findings were diagnostic of retroperitoneal perigraft infection in 17 of 20 patients shown to be infected at surgery. Retroperitoneal infection was correctly excluded on the basis of MR findings in four patients. Thus, MR imaging is an accurate imaging method for the diagnosis of aortic graft infection. In the early postoperative phase, resolving perigraft fluid cannot be differentiated from perigraft infection.\r"

  ".W": "A magnetic resonance imaging method based on the use of radio-frequency (RF) magnetic field gradients to detect molecular motion has been combined with GRASS (gradient-recalled acquisition in a steady state) imaging to detect arterial blood flow in vivo. The method has been used to selectively attenuate signals from flowing blood in the human finger. Attenuation of signals from arterial blood was greatly reduced when blood flow was decreased with the application of a tourniquet. This result demonstrated the sensitivity of the technique to the rate of blood flow. RF gradient coils can be used to generate very high RF gradients with submicrosecond rise times and minimal eddy currents. Therefore, this method may prove useful for imaging very slow, nonuniform flow through capillary beds and in the extravascular space.\r"

In healthy children younger than 5 years of age, the thymus had a quadrilateral shape and biconvex lateral contours. Older children and adolescents had a triangular thymus with straight lateral margins. The thymus appeared homogeneous with a signal intensity slightly greater than that of muscle on T1-weighted images and close to that of fat on T2-weighted images. Qualitative evaluation of gross thymic morphology (size, shape, margins, and signal intensity) usually was sufficient for distinguishing between the normal and abnormal thymus. The abnormal thymus generally was enlarged, multilobular, or inhomogeneous because of the presence of cystic degeneration, hemorrhage, septations, fibrosis, or calcification on pathologic sections. In patients with lymphoma, the presence of associated lymphadenopathy also was helpful in distinguishing the normal from the abnormal thymus.\r"

The signal intensity of the presphenoid bone marrow (anteromedial part of the sphenoid bone) was as low as that of muscle (grade 1) and remained the same as that of the basisphenoid and basiocicput in all infants (n = 6) younger than 6 months. Between 7 months and 2 years, most patients (24 of 27) exhibited fatty conversion of bone marrow limited to the presphenoid (grade 2). After 3 years of age, most patients demonstrated pneumatization (six of 12 at 3-4 years, eight of 11 at 5-6 years) in addition to the grade 2 findings (grade 3). The presphenoid exhibits signal intensity characteristics of fatty marrow before it is invaginated by the developing sphenoid sinus. Fatty change before pneumatization is a normal developmental process and should not be misinterpreted as a pathologic condition.\r"

The globus pallidus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, and dentate nucleus were evaluated with long TR/TE (repetition time/echo time) spin-echo sequences and staged. All four regions in most patients were initially hyperintense compared with white matter (stage I) before becoming isointense (stage II) and subsequently hypointense (stage III). The globus pallidus was the first to reach stage III, the red nucleus and substantia nigra were next, and the dentate nucleus was last. In general, decreased signal intensity (stage III) was not seen in these regions in patients less than 10 years old; in most patients it was seen by age 25 years. The dentate nucleus decreased in signal intensity more slowly and inconsistently; only one-third of patients had reached stage III by age 25 years. The temporal sequence of normal iron deposition as detected with MR imaging is helpful not only in the diagnosis of known iron-deposition diseases but also in the detection of iron-related pathologic changes.\r"

GRE techniques, irrespective of echo time and flip angle, showed the greatest change in signal intensity (enhancement) of the liver after administration of iron oxide. Single-acquisition GRE sequences (16 seconds) matched the contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) performance of the most effective 6.4-minute SE sequences. Multiexcitation GRE sequences showed tumor-liver C/Ns per unit time that were significantly (P less than .05) higher than those achieved with SE and IR sequences. GRE sequences, which recruit intravoxel dephasing as an additional source of transverse relaxation enhancement (T2*), show a higher C/N per unit time and in this respect seem superior to SE and IR sequences for MR imaging with superparamagnetic iron oxide.\r"

Subtle simulated abnormalities (3-7-mm polyps, 4-15-mm ulcer craters, 4-11-mm-diameter edema, and 11-12-mm linear ulcers) were produced in resected canine stomachs. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of 1,800 observations by six readers indicated that the digital images with and without high-frequency edge enhancement were equivalent to conventional radiographs (mean receiver operating characteristic areas [+/- standard deviation]: 0.76 +/- 0.06, 0.78 +/- 0.04, and 0.77 +/- 0.04, respectively). The accuracy of the diagnosis was equivalent for all three modalities. The following mean accuracies of negative and positive responses, respectively, for unenhanced digital, edge-enhanced digital, and conventional images were determined: 0.71 +/- 0.05 and 0.41 +/- 0.07, 0.71 +/- 0.04 and 0.51 +/- 0.09, and 0.68 +/- 0.04 and 0.43 +/- 0.05.

With a single exception, adrenal glands have been described as normal with computed tomography (CT) in all previous series. Eight patients had Cushing syndrome due to surgically proved PPNAD. Four of the eight patients had stigmas of Carney complex (lentigines, calcified Sertoli cell tumors of the testes, and cardiac and soft-tissue myxomas). CT and/or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated unilateral or bilateral nodularity in five of six patients examined. Macronodules (greater than 10 mm) were seen in the two oldest patients. As the clinical presentation of Cushing syndrome in this group of patients may be atypical (severe osteoporosis or short stature), the detection of multiple, small adrenocortical nodules with CT or MR imaging supports, or may even suggest, the diagnosis of PPNAD.\r"

In particular, the authors determined whether effects of variations in distribution volume (Vd) of iodine-131 iodohippurate on measurement of ERPF could be ignored, an assumption implicit in the single-sample technique. The influence of Vd on ERPF was found to be significant, a factor indicating an important and previously unappreciated source of error in the single-sample technique. Therefore, a new two-compartment, two-plasma-sample technique was developed on the basis of the observations that while variations in Vd occur from patient to patient, the relationship between intravascular and extravascular components of Vd and the rate of iodohippurate exchange between the components are stable throughout a wide range of physiologic and pathologic conditions. The new technique was applied in a series of 30 studies in 19 patients. Results were compared with those achieved with the reference, single-sample, and slope-intercept techniques. The new two-compartment, two-sample technique yielded estimates of ERPF that more closely agreed with the reference multiple-sample method than either the single-sample or slope-intercept techniques.\r"

In 11 patients with acquired lymphedema, a well-defined obstructive pattern was seen, characterized by discrete peripheral lymphatic trunks, delayed or absent depiction of regional nodes, and delayed but extensive soft-tissue tracer extravasation. Five of nine patients with congenital lymphedema showed hypoplasia characterized by poorly defined lymphatic trunks, delayed depiction of regional nodes, and early and extensive extravasation of tracer. The other four patients showed aplasia, with absence of trunks, no depiction of nodes, and little or no tracer extravasation. LAS is technically simple to perform and requires no special training. Radiation exposure is minuscule, and the procedure is safe and without apparent side effects. For these reasons, whole-body LAS should be the preferred method for the initial assessment of congenital or acquired lymphedema.\r"

  ".W": "Clinically assessed chronic proteinacious sinonasal secretions usually have long T1 and T2 relaxation times reflecting their high water content. However, in some cases variable combinations of short and long T1 and T2 relaxation times are found. To study the causes of these findings, the magnetic resonance (MR) images of 41 patients with surgically proved, chronically obstructed sinonasal secretions were studied. The relative signal intensities on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences of the sinus specimens were correlated with the gross viscosity of the specimens at surgery. Ten specimens were collected that were not contaminated with either blood or saline. UV spectrophotometric analysis of four of these samples excluded the presence of methemoglobin. Total protein content was determined in five samples, and in vitro T1 and T2 values were measured in one sample. These T1 and T2 relaxation times were accurately predicted with use of a standard pure lysozyme protein solution with the same concentration as the specimen. In addition, the observed T1- and T2-weighted signal intensities on the 41 MR images were predicted from an analysis of pure protein solutions. This study concludes that the primary causes of the variable T1 and T2 relaxation times of chronic sinonasal secretions are the macromolecular protein concentration, the amount of free water, and the specimen viscosity. Furthermore, an orderly and predictable transition of these signal intensities occurs over time.\r"

  ".W": "Symptomatic cholesterol granuloma developed in the middle ear cavities in three cases. At computed tomography (CT) after the administration of contrast material, the granulomas appeared as nonspecific, nonenhanced soft-tissue masses with variable bone erosion. These features are indistinguishable from those of other similar clinical entities, especially cholesteatoma, paraganglioma, and endaural brain hernia. At magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, cholesterol granulomas had a more characteristic appearance. In two cases, the granulomas were depicted as areas of high signal intensity with both T1- and T2-weighted sequences. In the third case, an expansile mastoid cholesterol cyst exhibited medium signal intensity on T1-weighted images, with only a small hyperintense area and a hypointense area located in the cystic wall. Correlations between CT, MR, and microscopic findings show that MR imaging is far superior to CT in tumoral characterization, which is crucial for planning surgical approaches. MR imaging has limitations, however, particularly its inability to depict subtle bone abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies in 117 control patients were reviewed to evaluate for focal signal-intensity variations in the posterior internal capsule. Rounded foci of increased signal intensity were found near the junction of the posterior limb and retrolenticular portion of the internal capsule on axial T2-weighted images in 56% of patients imaged at 1.5 T and in 50% imaged at 0.5 T. Corresponding hypointense foci were found on T1-weighted images in 64% of control patients imaged at 1.5 T and in 69% imaged at 0.5 T. With all sequences, the foci were homogeneous and well defined, without mass effect, and bilaterally symmetric. Comparison was made with MR imaging studies in 32 patients with pathologic involvement of the posterior internal capsule region. Symmetric morphology and signal intensity, sharply defined margins, confinement to a characteristic location, signal intensity approximating that of cortical gray matter on T2-weighted images, and isointensity or hypointensity on spin-density-weighted images appear to characterize normal posterior capsular foci and distinguish them from foci of pathologic lesions. A region that stained less intensely than the surrounding internal capsule was noted in tissue blocks from two normal brain specimens, corresponding in morphology and position to the signal-intensity changes seen on MR images. The properties of this focus suggest that it may represent fibers of the parietopontine tract.\r"

  ".W": "A recently developed method for image-selected localized hydrogen-1 magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy was assessed in the differential diagnosis of nine primary and secondary cerebral tumors, including four gliomas, two meningiomas, one neurilemoma, one arachnoid cyst, and one metastasis of breast cancer. Well-resolved H-1 MR spectra of these tumors were obtained in vivo with a conventional 1.5-T whole-body MR imaging system. All tumor spectra were remarkably different from spectra from normal brain tissue. Spectra obtained from different tumors exhibited reproducible differences, while histologically similar tumors yielded characteristic spectra with only minor differences. The observed spectral alterations reflect variations in concentrations and relaxation times of the H-1 MR sensitive pool of free (mobile) metabolites within the tissues. In most cases, the concentrations of N-acetyl-aspartate and creatine/phosphocreatine are reduced below detectability, whereas choline-containing compounds are generally enhanced. The spectral differences between the tumors are mainly due to the differing concentrations of lipids, lactic acid, and carbohydrates. Localized H-1 MR spectroscopy may become an important clinical tool for the differentiation of tumors as well as for therapeutic control.\r"

Of 77 patients with microscopic axillary metastases, 68 received systemic adjuvant therapy. Treatment failed locally in 26 cases, and there were seven patients with distant metastasis. The three major factors for increased local treatment failure were (a) age below 40 years (P = .003), (b) negative estrogen receptor assay result (P = .03), and (c) failure to deliver a radiation boost dose when tumor was present at the margin of the specimen (P = .002). The size of the tumor, the nodal status, the progesterone receptor assay result, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ mixed with infiltrating carcinoma did not show a significant influence on local recurrence. In 274 of 393 (70%) patients, cosmesis was evaluated. The four major factors affecting cosmesis favorably were (a) utilization of a wedge (P less than .0001); (b) treatment of two fields a day (P less than .0001); (c) failure to use a separate treatment port to the regional lymph nodes, so as to avoid field junctions (P = .0003); and (d) small size of specimen (less than 50 cm2) (P = .0171). A second or third cancer was found in 39 of the 393 (10%) patients; contralateral breast cancer was the most common form (n = 23), followed by genitourinary cancer (n = 5). The most frequent complication was arm edema (6%).\r"

Film dosimetry measurements were made in pelvic phantoms to compare the isodose distributions of various external-beam radiation therapy techniques for boost treatment of prostate target volumes. Idealized calculations were performed to determine the isodose distribution of an I-125 implant. A comparison of these techniques shows that the multiplanar and biplanar arc techniques produce isodose distributions that may be useful in the treatment of prostate carcinoma.\r"

Twelve different fungal species accounted for these infections, including Trichosporon beigelii, Fusarium species, Geotrichum candidum, Curvularia species, Drechslera species, Penicillium species (but not Penicillium marneffei), Rhodotorula rubra, Pseudallescheria boydii, Pichia farinosa, Torulopsis pintolopesii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Cunninghamella bertholletiae. Skin lesions were noted in seven patients, and sinusitis occurred in four. Twenty-four patients had disseminated infection, 12 had involvement of a single organ, and eight had fungemia alone. Features that correlated with a poor prognosis were persistent neutropenia and disseminated visceral infection but not fungemia alone. We suggest that unusual fungi have now emerged as significant pathogens in this patient population. Fungal sinusitis, previously caused by Aspergillus species and the phycomycetes, also occurs as a result of some of these newly recognized fungi. A high level of suspicion should be maintained when any of these unusual fungi are cultured from clinical specimens from immunocompromised patients.\r"

Overall mortality was 59%, candidemia directly contributing to death in 75% of cases.

The types of infection were bronchopneumonia, cavitary pneumonia, empyema, brain abscess, meningitis, and cutaneous abscesses.

During a period of improved standards of living, the overall reported incidence of the disease increased. In the Jewish population, the age of peak incidence shifted from 1-4 y to 5-9 y; this change is compatible with improved sanitation. However, whereas the absolute incidence declined among children 1-4 y old, it doubled among those 5-9 y old over the same period. The peak incidence in the non-Jewish population remains in children 1-4 y old. One possible explanation for the rise in overall incidence is an increase in the ratio of clinical to subclinical infections due to a shift of peak incidence to an older age group. Seasonal patterns have persisted against a background of changing morbidity, with the maximal incidence from late summer to midwinter. An unexplained, consistent excess incidence among males is observed for all age groups.\r"

  ".W": "In a retrospective survey of patients hospitalized in the Department of Medicine of the University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, from 1980 to 1986, we found 269 patients with history of past or current drug abuse. The charts of these patients were analyzed for infectious complications according to defined criteria. Heroin was the principal drug consumed by 95%. In 127 patients (47%) at least one infectious complication was diagnosed. In 125 (31%) of 404 admissions, the infectious problem was the main reason for hospitalization. Among the 269 patients, 217 infective episodes occurred. Pulmonary infections were the most frequently occurring (52 episodes). There were 44 cases of viral hepatitis, 30 of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and 25 of minor genital infections. Bone and joint infections and sepsis/endocarditis were diagnosed in seven cases each. The overall mortality was 4.1%; however, only three of the 11 deaths were attributed to infections. Intravenous drug addiction is complicated by a high morbidity because of infections that were seldom lethal during the observed period.\r"

  ".W": "Fresh sera from normal rhesus monkeys, guinea pigs, and rabbits inactivated 90%-99% of the infectivity of Vero cell-passaged, attenuated strains of Junin virus (JV) within 60 minutes. Selective depletion studies showed that inactivation occurred by the classical complement pathway. Complement had little effect on virulent JV strains. Adsorption of the fresh sera with JV-infected Vero cells showed that inactivation was not mediated by low levels of antibodies in normal sera. The cells used for propagation of the virus affected inactivation: virus passaged in Vero cells (a continuous African green monkey kidney line) was more susceptible than virus passaged in FRhL-2 cells (a diploid strain derived from fetal rhesus monkey lung). Complement was important for in vitro neutralization of virulent JV strains by immune sera but was unnecessary for neutralization of attenuated strains. Thus, complement may be important in host resistance to Argentine hemorrhagic fever in two ways: first, complement activation may contribute to the attenuated phenotype of some strains; and second, complement may be necessary for efficient neutralization of virulent strains.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred thirteen cases of Lassa fever (LF) were diagnosed by virus isolation and seroconversion at Curran Lutheran Hospital in Zorzor, Liberia, between July 1980 and April 1986. An additional 40 cases of probable and presumptive LF were diagnosed on the basis of single serum samples. Of the 246 assessable patients, 23 (9%) died; no data were available for seven patients. Five (16%) of 32 pregnant women and three (43%) of seven immediately postpartum women died. Four (26%) of 15 children less than 12 years died. Case-fatality rates among 125 nonpregnant women and 67 men were approximately 6%. Among 150 patients studied in detail, the case-fatality rate was also 9%. Seventeen (11%) of these patients had abnormal bleeding; of these, six (35%) died. Most platelet counts were at low normal to mildly depressed levels. However, serial counts in seven patients suggested a decrease on about days 10-12 of illness. The symptoms of LF in Liberia are those of a viral syndrome. Edema, sometimes marked, is noted in seriously ill patients. A great variation in mortality and incidence of abnormal bleeding is recorded in reported series of LF; it appears that hemorrhage is a marker for cases with a high mortality. The incidence and severity of hearing defects in LF outbreaks vary. Elucidation of a number of clinical problems in LF requires more information on how strain differences affect the pattern of illness.\r"

All of those affected had the following common signs and symptoms: sudden onset of high fever, with chills, headache, myalgia, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, sore throat, expressionless face, and profound prostration. In some cases, on around the fifth day of the acute phase, the appearance of an exanthematous rash on the trunk announced the hemorrhagic manifestations: hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, bleeding ulcerations in the mouth and on the lips, gingival bleeding, hematemesis, and melena; epistaxis, ear bleeding, hematuria, and postpartum hemorrhages were also reported. All these hemorrhagic cases had a fatal outcome within about a week. The hemorrhagic manifestations were less severe in the cases that occurred by the end of the outbreak than in the first reported cases. Hemorrhagic manifestations were less frequent and less severe, or even absent, in the nonfatal cases (convalescents, serologically confirmed). No biologic investigation of the hemostatic impairment could be performed under the emergency conditions of this field study.\r"

Petechial rash and hemorrhagic signs such as epistaxis, hematemesis, and melena supervened on days 3-6 of illness. Deaths occurred on days 5-14 of illness. Patients with fatal infections had thrombocytopenia and markedly elevated levels of serum aspartate and alanine aminotransaminases, gamma-glutamyltransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, bilirubin, creatinine, and urea. Total protein, albumin, fibrinogen, and hemoglobin levels were depressed. Values for prothrombin ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and fibrin degradation products were grossly elevated, findings that indicate the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Many of the clinical pathologic changes were evident at an early stage of the disease and had a highly predictive value for fatal outcome of infection. Changes were present but less marked in nonfatal infections.\r"

In a small percentage of human cases, the disease is complicated by hemorrhage, which often is associated with a fatal outcome. Inoculation of rhesus monkeys with the Zagazig Hospital strain of RVF virus produced a clinical picture similar to illness in humans. Ten of 17 monkeys developed clinical evidence of hemostatic impairment. When coagulation tests were performed, this group of monkeys had significant abnormalities, including evidence for disseminated intravascular coagulation. These abnormalities were much less pronounced in the remaining seven monkeys-whose only sign of illness was transient fever-and, in general, they paralleled the level of viremia and the degree of elevation in levels of serum hepatic enzymes. Autopsy of the three monkeys with severe disease revealed hepatic necrosis.\r"

Clinical, virologic, immunologic, and hemostatic parameters were monitored. Five daily inoculations of 5 X 10(5) units of either interferon product per kilogram of body weight, initiated 24 hours before or 6 hours after RVFV infection, prevented or greatly suppressed viremia. No clinical signs of disease or laboratory evidence of impaired hemostasis was observed. Serum neutralizing antibody to RVFV was detected within 6 days of virus inoculation. Prophylactic administration of 5 X 10(4) or 5 X 10(3) units of rIFN-alpha A per kilogram also limited viremia, hepatocellular damage, and hemostatic derangement. Untreated, RVFV-infected, control monkeys developed high-titered viremia, clinical disease, and impaired hemostasis. These data suggest that rIFN-alpha A and HuIFN-alpha are effective in protecting RVFV-infected rhesus monkeys from viremia and hepatocellular damage and may be beneficial in human RVF infection.\r"

  ".W": "Several clinical variants of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) are caused by Hantaan and related viruses. Since 1951, 500-900 patients with HFRS have been hospitalized annually in Korea. Although HFRS is associated primarily with rural areas, it is now being recognized as an urban problem and a particular hazard to laboratory staff using rodents for research. Recently, epidemic outbreaks of leptospirosis and scrub typhus have occurred during the HFRS season, leading to confusion in diagnosis. Serologic diagnosis of HFRS is based on the demonstration of IgM antibodies to Hantaviruses by the indirect fluorescent antibody technique or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The specific Hantavirus causing infection can be identified on the basis of titers of plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody. Results of studies with monoclonal antibodies suggest that viral subtypes exist for each Hantaviral serotype presently recognized. While infection with Hantaviruses is known to be a problem of worldwide dimensions, present evidence indicates that it occurs over a wider area than previously recognized. Vertical transmission of Hantaan virus in a pregnant woman has been documented.\r"

In the early stage of the disease, platelet counts, platelet survival time, and platelet aggregation in vitro decreased. Prolongation of bleeding time, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time was noted, with decreases in coagulation factors II, V, VIII, IX, and X. Levels of fibrinogen were decreased, and those of fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products in serum and urine were increased. Concentrations of plasminogen, alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor, and antithrombin III in plasma were depressed. Procoagulant activity was present in plasma. Circulating immune complexes were found, whereas serum levels of C3 were decreased. In the early stage of HFRS, thrombocytopenia, defects in platelet function, and disseminated intravascular coagulation may play central roles in the pathogenesis of bleeding manifestations. Vasculopathy and immunologic aberrations also may play a role.\r"

Twenty-seven patients with serologically confirmed HFRS were studied; 10 required renal dialysis, six had hemorrhagic manifestations, and four died. In patients with hemorrhagic manifestations, the platelet counts were generally less than 100,000 cells/microL. In three patients findings were compatible with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Laboratory investigation showed a consistent rise in levels of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine beginning on the fifth or sixth day of illness and reaching a maximum level between the ninth and 12th days of illness. The disease in Greece more closely resembles the Asian form of HFRS (Korean hemorrhagic fever) than the Scandinavian form of the disease (nephropathia epidemica) because of the high mortality rate, the occurrence of hemorrhagic manifestations, and the severity of the clinical disease.\r"

Histologic examination showed myxoma in seven cases, fibroma in one and metastases of malignant melanoma in two cases. The course after resection of endoluminal benign tumor was uneventful apart from transient atrial fibrillation in four cases. Follow-up echocardiography (after 4-28 months) showed no recurrent growth. In both cases of intracardiac metastases there was recurrence within 6 to 8 months after resection of the growth.\r"

In group I myocardial energy preservation was determined with biochemical assays for adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate, lactate and creatine 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after aortic clamping, and preservation of endothelium in the aorta and coronary arteries was studied with scanning electron microscopy. In group II electron microscopy was performed on endothelial samples from the ascending aorta and coronary and pulmonary arteries of the heart-lung block after excision, after 2 hours of ischemia, and after 1-2 hours of reperfusion. High-energy phosphates decreased progressively during the ECS cardioplegia in group I, and circulatory support was required during the post-transplantation reperfusion period in group II. The endothelial lining in all specimens was remarkably well preserved, however. Modified ECS flush thus was ideal for vascular endothelium but, because of its poor energy-preserving capacity, unsuitable for cardioplegia.\r"

Infusion of XOD (n = 8) or HX (n = 5) alone also reduced cardiac survival time, to 32 +/- 6 min and 139 +/- 23 min, respectively. When allopurinol (an inhibitor of XOD) was given together with XOD (n = 6), survival time (277 +/- 30 min) was similar to the control value. The production of OFR did not result in depressed coronary flow or heart rate, but reduced the aortic pulse pressure. OFR thus can depress cardiac function and may ultimately cause cardiac arrest.\r"

The pulmonary circulation is re-established by anastomosis of the neo-pulmonary trunk to the pulmonary tree. The technique was used on 26 mongrel dogs. In 14 the experiments were preliminary, to evaluate the technique's validity, and in the other 12 it was performed with extracorporeal circulation and the hemodynamic status was studied at 30 and 180 min postoperatively.

The technique has been widely accepted for clinical staging as a guide to operability and prognosis. We report on a consecutive retrospective series of 110 patients undergoing mediastinoscopy between 1982-1986 for primary mediastinal lymphadenopathy in order to assess the diagnostic value and safety of the procedure. Mediastinoscopy gave a positive histological diagnosis in 74.5% of cases with no false negative results. There were no deaths and one complication only (pneumothorax). This study shows mediastinoscopy to be a safe, accurate and cost effective procedure minimising hospital stay and allowing appropriate treatment to be immediately commenced upon diagnosis. Mediastinoscopy obviates the need for expensive computed tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance scans and we conclude that it is the investigation of choice for primary mediastinal lymphadenopathy after confirmation by plain chest radiography.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac performance and hemodynamics were studied with radionuclide ventriculography in 19 survivors of aneurysmectomy and encircling endocardial ventriculotomy for recurrent, sustained ventricular arrhythmia (group I). To characterize the effect of the ventriculotomy on cardiac function, comparisons were made with a similar group of patients who underwent aneurysm surgery for angina pectoris and/or congestive heart failure (group II). Functional classification revealed no difference between the groups and they achieved the same level of exercise after surgery. No intergroup difference was found postoperatively with respect to right or left ventricular ejection fraction, regional ejection fractions, peak ejection rate, cardiac index or stroke volume. Peak filling rate was also similar, as were cardiac volumes. Exercise did not change any parameter of this intergroup similarity. The authors conclude that most patients with moderately impaired left ventricular function who undergo left ventricular aneurysmectomy with encircling endocardial ventriculotomy do not differ in postoperative hemodynamics and systolic or diastolic function from those treated with simple aneurysmectomy.\r"

Interactions with protein are dominated by nonbonding forces with few specific contacts. The tertiary and quaternary structures of the BPMV capsid proteins are similar to those observed in animal picornaviruses, supporting the close relation between plant comoviruses and animal picornaviruses established by previous biological studies.\r"

Chromosome fragments were dissected from human metaphase spreads and microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs. Many of the injected eggs subsequently exhibited normal pre- and postimplantation development. Embryos obtained from eggs injected with centromeric fragments retained human centromeric DNA as demonstrated by in situ hybridization analysis. From eggs injected with noncentromeric fragments, a mouse was obtained whose tail tissue exhibited the presence of human DNA. This procedure should facilitate incorporation of very large (more than 10 megabases) DNA fragments into cells and embryos without the need for cloned sequences.\r"

  ".U": "89317464\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of peptide chemoattractants on neutrophil mechanical properties was studied to test the hypothesis that stimulated neutrophils (diameter, 8 micrometers) are retained in pulmonary capillaries (5.5 micrometers) as a result of a decreased ability of the cell to deform within the capillary in response to the hydrodynamic forces of the bloodstream. Increased neutrophil stiffness, actin assembly, and retention in both 5-micrometer pores and the pulmonary vasculature were seen in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. These changes were abolished in cells that had been incubated with 2 micromolar cytochalasin D, an agent that disrupts cellular actin organization. A monoclonal antibody directed at the CD11-CD18 adhesive glycoprotein complex did not inhibit the increase in stiffness or retention in pores. These data suggest that neutrophil stiffening may be both necessary and sufficient for the retention that is observed. Hence, neutrophil sequestration in lung and other capillaries in the acute inflammatory process may be the result of increased stiffness stimulated by chemoattractants.\r"

  ".W": "The role of a local angiotensin system in the vascular response to arterial injury was investigated by administering the angiotensin-converting enzyme (CE) inhibitor cilazapril to normotensive rats in which the left carotid artery was subjected to endothelial denudation and injury by balloon catheterization. In control animals, by 14 days after balloon injury, the processes of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, migration of SMCs from the media to the intima, and synthesis of extracellular matrix produced marked thickening of the intima, with reduction of the cross-sectional area of the lumen. However, in animals that received continuous treatment with the CE inhibitor, neointima formation was decreased (by about 80 percent), and lumen integrity was preserved. Thus, the angiotensin-converting enzyme may participate in modulating the proliferative response of the vascular wall after arterial injury, and inhibition of this enzyme may have therapeutic applications to prevent the proliferative lesions that occur after coronary angioplasty and vascular surgery.\r"

Microinjections of morphine into the PAG, but not into other opiate receptor-containing neuroanatomical sites, result in a rapid suppression of natural killer (NK) cell activity. The NK cell suppression can be blocked by prior peripheral administration of the opiate antagonist naltrexone. These findings demonstrate that certain central actions of opiates that produce changes in NK cell function are mediated through opiate receptors in the PAG and identify a brain region involved in opiate regulation of immune function.\r"

Brief local injections of this amine, or application of a 5HT uptake blocker, produce a long-lasting enhancement of both spontaneous and evoked inhibitory currents in the teleost Mauthner cell. Quantal analysis showed that the probability of release is increased. Focal recording indicated that 5HT acts directly on the inhibitory terminals, possibly reducing potassium conductances. Double staining with specific antibodies demonstrated a morphological substrate for this effect. Nerve endings that contain 5HT contact inhibitory terminals directly apposed to postsynaptic glycine receptors.\r"
