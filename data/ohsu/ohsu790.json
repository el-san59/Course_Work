Hybridoma cell culture supernatants containing mAb were screened by ELISA for positive binding to the immunizing Ag, murine splenocytes and the murine 70Z/3 pre B cell and for an absence of binding to sheep E. Positive clones were further screened for reciprocal competitive binding with LPS on spleen cells and ability to modulate B lymphocyte mitogenic activity. Two hybridoma cell lines secreting IgM monoclonals, termed mAb3D7 and mAb5D3, were identified that satisfied all of the selection criteria. These hybridoma cell lines were subcloned and expanded. Binding of one (mAb3D7) was abrogated by treatment of Ag with mild periodate; binding of the second (mAb5D3) was destroyed by digestion of Ag with proteinase K. Binding specificity for mAb5D3 has been confirmed by ELISA using highly purified 80-kDa protein. These mAb have been of value in establishing that the 80-kDa LPS binding protein previously identified may serve as a specific functional receptor for LPS.\r"

Treatment of SJL/J mice with splenocytes coupled with mouse spinal cord homogenate (MSCH) or myelin proteolipid protein after immunization with mouse spinal cord homogenate in CFA, but before the onset of clinical signs specifically inhibited the expression of neuroantigen-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity responses and significantly suppressed the onset, severity, and the duration of clinical and histologic signs of R-EAE. In contrast, the clinical course of R-EAE was not affected by tolerization with myelin basic protein-coupled splenocytes, indicating that proteolipid protein-specific responses play the major role in active MSCH-induced R-EAE. To ensure a physical and temporal separation between the inductive and effector stages of the disease process, we also examined the effects of neuroantigen-coupled splenocytes on adoptive R-EAE. Treatment of recipient mice with MSCH-coupled splenocytes up to 6 days after the transfer of MBP-primed lymph node cells induced a dose-dependent, profound, and long-lasting inhibition of clinical and histologic signs of adoptive R-EAE. The demonstration that splenocytes coupled with a heterogeneous mixture of neuroantigens (i.e., MSCH) can inhibit established immune responses suggests that this methodology has potential for regulating ongoing immune responses associated with autoimmune disorders or chronic graft rejection in which the specific (auto)Ag has yet to be identified.\r"

These changes were associated with proportionate alterations in IL-6 mRNA accumulation. Nuclear run-on analysis demonstrated that the effects of rIL-1 and rTNF individually were associated with increased IL-6 gene transcription. In contrast, alterations in gene transcription could not fully explain the synergistic effects of rIL-1 and rTNF in combination. However, IL-6 mRNA was significantly more stable in cells stimulated with rIL-1 plus rTNF than in cells stimulated with rIL-1 alone. Thus the synergistic effects of rIL-1 and rTNF in combination were mediated, at least partially, by an alteration in the stability of IL-6 mRNA. Alterations in mRNA stability may be an important mechanism of cytokine-cytokine synergy.\r"

Fragment LT1 (-293 to +77 in relation to the proximal cap site) exhibited promoter activity which drove CAT expression in transfected murine fibroblasts and T lymphomas. Primer extension analysis of endogenous LT message confirmed that LT1 contained the necessary elements required for promoter function. Promoter activity was not observed when LT2 (-662 to +77), LT3 (-1186 to +77), or LT3 delta AX (-1186 to +77 (delta-662/-269)) were ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene and transfected into fibroblasts or T lymphomas. At least one upstream repressor element is postulated to account for this promoter inhibition. In contrast to the results obtained with fibroblast and T cell transfectants, LT1 was inactive in the B cell transfectants A20 and P3X63. This suggests that some B cells express a repressor factor that inhibits the LT promoter and/or they lack the necessary positive regulatory factors.\r"

In this study, the cells (\"pre-CFCmulti\") which originate this response are characterized in terms of their frequency, progeny number, factor requirements, buoyant density, and extent of restoration following marrow transplantation. Parallel measurements of both CFCmulti and cells providing long term marrow reconstitution in vivo allowed direct comparisons to be made with pre-CFCmulti. The proliferative response of pre-CFCmulti was found to depend uniquely on the combination of IL-1 and IL-3, and neither of these regulators was replaceable by any of IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF or LIF. After separation on density gradients, pre-CFCmulti were recovered in fractions of lower density than most of the CFCmulti, but in the same fractions that contained most of the in vivo reconstituting cells. After irradiation and marrow transplantation, marrow CFCmulti were restored to near normal levels, while both pre-CFCmulti as well as reconstituting stem cells remained profoundly depressed. These results show pre-CFCmulti to be distinct from most CFCmulti and to represent the closest approach to quantitative detection of reconstituting stem cells so far achieved in vitro.\r"

In the interest of understanding the pathophysiology of these processes we have begun to characterize the FcR for IgG on two readily available sources of macrophages--the lung and the peritoneum--using antireceptor mAb. We find that all three of the distinct classes of FcR for IgG which have been described in man are present on both pulmonary and peritoneal macrophages. Most monocytes, we suggest, bear low numbers of Fc gamma RIII whereas a small subpopulation of monocytes expresses substantial numbers of Fc gamma RIII. Furthermore, we find that two different forms of Fc gamma RIII differ in their capacity to bind anti-Fc gamma RIII mab 3G8 in the presence of human IgG. Human IgG does not block the binding of mAb 3G8 to neutrophils, but it does block 3G8 binding to macrophages and large granular lymphocytes; this finding correlates with the expression of the two Fc gamma RIII genes, I and II, in man. Studies aimed at illuminating the molecular mechanisms of Fc gamma R-mediated processes in macrophages will require consideration of the receptors of all three classes.\r"

  ".W": "BALB/c mice were inoculated i.p. with graded doses of a DNP-specific, IgM mAb (designated 57.1). Injection with unmodified 57.1 in the absence of adjuvants resulted in the generation of an anti-Id response (Ab2) and an anti-anti-Id response (Ab3). The generation of serum anti-Id antibodies was found to be thymus dependent. Nude mice immunized with 57.1 were unable to produce a serum Ab2 response above nonimmunized controls whereas euthymic mice receiving identical doses of 57.1 produced strong Ab2 responses. To examine the specificity of serum anti-Id, sera from mice receiving 57.1 were screened against a panel of mAb representing at least five distinct VH gene families. Serum titers were significantly higher against 57.1 than against any of the other antibodies in the panel. Three of the antibodies in this panel bind FD5-1, a monoclonal anti-Id (Ab2) that also binds 57.1. However, sera from mice receiving 57.1 bound 57.1 only. Thus, the serum Ab2 response appears to be highly specific for idiotopes on 57.1. The predominant isotype of these anti-Id antibodies was IgG1. The number of isotypes detected increased in a dose dependent manner with all IgG subclasses having anti-Id specificity in sera from animals receiving the higher doses of 57.1. Further analysis of the serum demonstrated that approximately 8% of the Ab2 response was paratope-specific (inhibitable by the monovalent hapten DNP-lysine). The same sera were analyzed for the presence of Ab3 by binding to the monoclonal anti-Id antibody FD5-1. Lower serum titers of Ab3 were generated in comparison to serum titers of Ab2. Analysis of the binding specificity of the Ab3 response revealed that DNP-BSA was able to partially inhibit the binding of serum IgM and IgG Ab3 to FD5-1. A subset of the Ab3 response. Ab1' that is specific for DNP was observed in a direct binding assay where detectable amounts of DNP binding IgM, IgG1, and IgG3 isotypes were present. We have thus described a complete circuit (Ab1----Ab2----Ab3) of antibodies within the Id network by immunizing animals with an unmodified mAb in the absence of Ag or adjuvants.\r"

An avidin-biotin ELISA was used to measure idiotypic binding between antibody populations from these sera. We found that the chicken sera contained auto-anti-idiotypes (AAI) against Ag-specific antibodies that were present in the same serum and that co-purified with those antibodies on Ag-Sepharose columns. These AAI were present in secondary response chicken anti-BSA serum at levels comparable with those of the anti-BSA antibody. The chicken AAI also react specifically with Id in mouse anti-BSA serum. The mouse anti-BSA serum completely inhibits the binding between the chicken Id and AAI. This similarity between the Id of whole populations of antibodies produced in two distantly related species, in the absence of any manipulation with idiotypic or anti-idiotypic reagents, suggests that the AAI detected in this way are internal image antibodies. It indicates there is positive selection for such AAI to be internal images.\r"

  ".W": "Previous experiments have resulted in the identification and cloning of 13 nonallelic genes encoding the constant region of rabbit IgA H chains. The genes, C alpha 1 to C alpha 13, were each cloned into an expression vector containing the VDJ gene of a dansyl (DNS)-binding murine hybridoma and the constructs were then transfected into SP2/0 cells that were producing murine kappa-L chains from the DNS-binding hybridoma. Of the 13 resulting transfectomas, 12 were shown, by ELISA, to secrete DNS-binding chimeric rabbit-mouse IgA molecules. These transfectoma antibodies, representing 12 different isotypes, are of high affinity and provide a unique source of Ag-specific IgA for comparison of the functions of the multiple IgA isotypes. One such function for antibodies is activation of C by either the classical or alternative pathway. We have used the DNS-binding IgA transfectoma antibodies in C assays based on binding of rabbit C3 to IgA-Ag complexes in an ELISA. The results demonstrated that all 12 IgA isotypes are capable of activating C by the alternative pathway but that none can activate C by the classical pathway. Control experiments demonstrated that activation was hapten dependent and was not caused by endotoxin contamination. These data demonstrate that Ag-specific IgA molecules, unmodified by heat or chemical aggregation, activate C by the alternative pathway but not by the classical pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Membrane cofactor protein (MCP) is a cell-associated regulatory molecule for C system with C3b/C4b binding and factor I-dependent cofactor activity. mAb were raised against MCP and amounts and distribution examined on normal human cells and cell lines. The mean quantity of MCP was 3000 to 7000 copies/cell in normal blood cells, except for E which have no MCP. Of note, PMN did not fully reveal all MCP sites until incubated for greater than 30 min at 37 degrees C. In most tumor cell lines, except for B cell lineages, expression of MCP increased by 2- to 8-fold in comparison with the normal cell counterparts. Strikingly, recombinant granulocyte CSF treatment of myeloid cell lines and hemin treatment of an erythroblastoid cell line, K562, led to a decrease of MCP to near normal levels. In contrast, C3b/C4b receptor (CR1) tended to increase with granulocyte-CSF treatment in several cell lines. We simultaneously determined levels of decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and CR1 in these tumor cells, and tested susceptibility to C3 deposition via activation of the alternative C pathway. Of 21 cell lines we examined, 14 lacked CR1 and two lacked DAF; none, however, lacked MCP. A slight amount of C3 deposition was observed in some myeloid cell lines and EBV-infected B cell lines. However, C3 deposition did not reflect a defect in the regulatory proteins. Tumor cells bearing MCP, lacking CR1 or DAF, and undergoing no C3 deposition, may escape C attack due to the compensatory effect of MCP in the absence of the other regulatory proteins. High expression of MCP provides a convenient means for tumor cells to block C attack and survive in blood stream. We favor the interpretation that MCP is up-regulated in association with certain malignant disorders, and that cell differentiation results in a switch from an MCP-dominant state to a CR1-dominant state.\r"

  ".W": "Mitogenesis, cell differentiation and immune-inflammatory responses are regulated by the coordinated assembly of proteases with specific cellular receptors. We have investigated the possibility that immune effector cells may express a high-affinity protease receptor. To address this hypothesis, we have generated mAb to factor V and its activated form Va, a circulating plasma protein that binds the serine protease of the coagulation cascade, factor Xa. Further, by flow microfluorimetry screening, we have isolated a panel of these mAb that recognize a surface molecule expressed on transformed monocytic cells. We now show that these mAb bind to blood monocytes, to CD3- CD16+ CD56+ NK cells, and with considerable heterogeneity, to neutrophils. A small subset of CD3+ cells (5 to 10%) was also identified by these probes and further phenotypically characterized by two-color flow microfluorimetry as predominantly coexpressing CD2, CD4 or CD8, CD57, CD11b, and alpha/beta TCR. This subset of CD3+ cells was expanded in vitro by both lectin- or Ag-specific stimulation. In addition, long term alloreactive stimulation resulted in approximately 8- to 10-fold increased expression of the molecule recognized by these mAb. Functional analyses were performed on a selected T cell clonal derivative of the transformed cell line HuT 78. These cells bound 125I-factor Xa in a specific reaction saturated at 194,000 +/- 26,000 molecules/cell with a Kd approximately 10 to 20 nM and inhibited by the mAb panel described above. These data suggest that immune effector cells express a dynamically regulated protease receptor that is immunologically related to the plasma coagulation protein factor V and its activated form Va. We propose the term effector cell protease receptor-1 to tentatively identify this molecule, and we speculate on its possible involvement in specialized protease-mediated effector functions.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of IL-1 and cortisol, and their interactions on the density of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta AR), cell proliferation, and the adherence of cells to plastic were studied in cultured human A549 lung tumor cells. The density of beta AR, assayed by 125I-pindolol binding, was increased two- to threefold by a 24-h incubation of the cells with IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha (EC50: 2.7, 8.2, and 24 pM, respectively), although a series of other cytokines and growth factors did not have this effect. Cortisol also increased beta AR density (EC50: 30 nM) and markedly potentiated the effects of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. Neither IL-1 nor cortisol influenced the proportion of cell surface vs internalized beta AR. The IL-1-induced increase in beta AR density was half-maximal after 6 h, was reversible at a similar rate, and was blocked by 1 microM of cycloheximide. The effect of IL-1 on beta AR was specific, as the density of glucocorticoid receptors, measured by 3H-dexamethasone binding, was reduced by IL-1. Both cortisol and IL-1 potentiated the isoproterenol-induced increase in cAMP accumulation. IL-1 inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine uptake, and increased the adherence of A549 cells to the plastic culture flask, as quantified by a cell detachment assay. The effect of IL-1 on cell adherence was not inhibited by cycloheximide. Cortisol decreased cell adherence and prevented the IL-1-induced increase in adherence. The results indicate that multiple effects of IL-1 in a cultured tumor cell line involve different mechanisms, suggesting heterogeneity of IL-1R and/or coupling of IL-1R to distinct, nuclear, and nonnuclear, effector pathways.\r"

We observed progressive expression of TCR gamma/delta-alpha/beta genes in the lymph node (LN) cells from 8 to 12 wk after grafting. An appreciable number of CD4+ T cells but few CD8+ T cells were detected in the LN at 8 wk after grafting. CD8+ T cells increased slowly in number by 12 wk after grafting but remained at a low level in comparison with those in nude mice 12 wk after grafting with BALB/c thymus. In correlation with an increase in the number of T cells expressing TCR alpha/beta genes, alloreactivity as assessed by MLR was increased to a normal level. However, CTL activity against alloantigens remained at a low level in the LN cells at 12 wk. At this stage, organ-specific autoimmune diseases and a high level of anti-DNA autoantibodies were detected. In these mice host-reactive T cells such as V beta 3- or V beta 11-bearing T cells were virtually eliminated in the peripheral mature T cell pool, whereas T cells maturing in the fetal rat thymus significantly proliferated in response to donor-rat stimulator cells. These results suggest that the development of the autoimmune diseases may be ascribed to an impaired maturation of CD8+ T cells but not to failure in clonal elimination of host-reactive T cells in nude mice grafted with rat thymus.\r"

  ".W": "We have characterized the mechanisms by which thrombin enhances neutrophil leukocyte (PMN) adhesion to human endothelial cells in vitro. Thrombin rapidly and transiently increased PMN adhesion by an action on the endothelial cells. The transience of the response was due to at least two factors: desensitization of the endothelial cell responsiveness to thrombin in the continued presence of the agonist; and the lability (t1/2 less than 15 min) of the effector molecules expressed by the endothelium. Experiments with exogenous platelet-activating factor (PAF) and with PAF antagonists demonstrated that PAF production, although it may facilitate the enhanced PMN adhesion seen in response to thrombin, is not sufficient to explain the reaction. By using a variety of antibodies directed against cell surface ligands, and comparing adhesion of PMN to endothelium and to protein-coated surfaces, we deduce that several endothelial ligands not previously reported as playing a role in PMN adhesion are involved in these interactions. Of particular interest was the finding that antibodies recognizing two thrombin-regulated endothelial cell surface ligands, GMP-140 and the CD63-related Ag, both inhibited adhesion of PMN to thrombin- or LPS-pretreated endothelium. We conclude that thrombin acts to enhance PMN adhesion to endothelium at least in part by transiently altering the conformation or level of expression of these ligands.\r"

Detection by flow cytometry of bound biotinylated MCP-1 with avidin-FITC confirmed results obtained with 125I-MCP-1. Biotinylated MCP-1 bound to monocytes but not to lymphocytes; and the binding was inhibited by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled MCP-1.\r"

The antigenic determinant recognized by the rabies virus-specific T cell clone contained a five-amino acid segment highly homologous to a sequence found in a hepatitis B surface Ag epitope that stimulates human T cells in the context of the HLA-DPw4. A preliminary model of DPw4-restricted T cell determinants is elaborated based on a hypothesis of how the 2 alpha-helical peptides may bind to this MHC molecule. Results are further discussed in the context of the usefulness in identifying DPw4-restricted T cell epitopes for the production of synthetic vaccines because this MHC class II molecule is found with high frequency in the population.\r"

Evidence is presented suggesting that the 17-kDa protein is a lipoprotein. Also, homology was found to a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein of Escherichia coli. Thirteen overlapping synthetic peptides encompassing the entire deduced protein were tested on lymphocytes from F. tularensis-primed individuals. Three peptides induced a T cell response, as disclosed by lymphocyte proliferation and production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Out of five responding individuals, only one recognized more than one of the peptides. A murine mAb recognized an epitope separate from the T cell-reactive peptides. The identified T cell epitopes are presumably relevant to the host defense against F. tularensis, especially because IFN-gamma is known to enhance the antimicrobial activity of the host against intracellular bacteria.\r"

At 4 degrees C, FITC-ReLPS bound rapidly in a concentration- and time-dependent way to PMN, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Because mononuclear cells showed both binding and nonbinding cell populations, FITC-ReLPS was used in conjunction with specific phycoerythrin-labeled mAb to identify these cell subpopulations. In contrast to T lymphocytes and NK cells, all monocytes and B lymphocytes efficiently bound FITC-ReLPS. PMN and monocytes showed two to three times more cell-associated FITC-ReLPS when cells were incubated at 37 degrees C compared with incubation at 4 degrees C. Binding of FITC-ReLPS to lymphocytes was similar for both 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C incubation conditions. In contrast to 4 degrees C, at 37 degrees C cell-associated LPS reflects surface-bound as well as internalized LPS, as demonstrated with fluorescence quenching of extracellular FITC-ReLPS by trypan blue. At 4 degrees C, binding of FITC-ReLPS was inhibited by polymyxin B. In addition, purified IgM mAb directed against hydrophobic acyl residues of ReLPS showed more than 95% inhibition of ReLPS binding to leukocytes, indicating the ability of specific mAb to prevent LPS-cell interactions necessary to exert biologic effects. The use of mAb, directed against different parts of the LPS molecule, provides an alternative method for LPS binding-inhibition studies.\r"

Their deduced protein sequences show 66% amino acid identity. In both mouse and man, the CD14 protein contains a repeating (10 times) leucine-rich motif (LXXLXLX) that is also found in a group of heterogeneous proteins from phylogenetically distant species. The CD14 gene has been mapped to mouse chromosome 18 which also contains at least five genes encoding receptors (Pdgfr, Adrb2r, li, Grl-1, Fms). Thus CD14 and the receptor genes form a conserved syntenic group localized on mouse chromosome 18 and human chromosome 5. The inclusion of CD14 in the family of leucine-rich proteins, its expression profile and the murine chromosomal localization support the hypothesis that CD14 may function as a receptor.\r"

  ".U": "90293482\r", 
  ".W": "CD28 is a 90-kDa homodimeric glycoprotein present on the surface of a large subset of T cells that appears to play an important role in the modulation of T cell activation. Although a number of physiologic effects associated with CD28 stimulation have been defined, relatively less is known about the structure and expression of the CD28 gene itself. We now show that CD28 is expressed in both Th cells and plasma cells as a series of four distinct CD28 mRNA species: 1.3-, 1.5-, 3.5-, and 3.7-kb transcripts. The steady state expression of all four transcripts in CD28+ T cells was stimulated by PMA, suggesting that they might share a common phorbol-sensitive promoter. Consistent with this hypothesis, CD28 was found to be encoded by a single copy gene organized into four exons, each exon defining a functional domain of the predicted protein. All CD28 transcripts appear to initiate within a 61-bp palindrome. Generation of the four CD28 mRNA species from the CD28 gene involves two distinct posttranscriptional events. The longer pair of transcripts (3.5/3.7 kb) is generated by the use of an alternate nonconsensus polyadenylation signal. This results in the addition of 2167 bp beyond the first polyadenylation site utilized by the shorter (1.3/1.5 kb) pair of transcripts. The size difference between the 3.7- and 3.5-kb messages and between the 1.5- and 1.3-kb messages is generated by an internal splicing event that deletes 252 bp within exon 2, which encodes the extracellular domain. This deletion would result in the loss of 84 amino acids, including 4 of 5 extracellular cysteine residues. Although this deletion would result in significant disruption of CD28 secondary structure, it would not be expected to interfere with the ability of the resultant protein to be expressed on the cell surface. These findings suggest that variant isotypes of CD28 may be expressed on the cell surface with potentially different physiologic roles.\r"

The HLA-DQw6 transgenic B6 mouse became tolerant to the DQw6 molecules, as evidenced by the MLR and antibody production specific to the DQw6 molecules. The HLA-DQw6 transgenic B6 mouse showed a strong immune response to streptococcal cell wall antigen (SCW), whereas the B6 mouse was a low responder to SCW. The SCW-specific T cell line was established from the transgenic mouse and this T cell line recognized SCW in the context of HLA-DQw6 molecules expressed on the mouse L cell transfectant or on human monocytes. The proliferative response to SCW of primed lymph node T cells and the SCW-specific T cell line derived from the transgenic mice was inhibited by anti-HLA-DQ mAb. Thus, it is clear that the HLA-DQw6 genes acted as major histocompatibility genes in these transgenic mice.\r"

Bulk lymphocyte cultures of purified T cells primed to an autologous variant EBV-LCL that fails to express HLA-class II and has reduced cell surface HLA-class I expression, and oligoclonal TCR-gamma delta-bearing lines derived from them, could lyse both this EBV-LCL and an independently derived, class II expressing autologous variant EBV-LCL that bears no HLA-A, -B, or -C, suggesting the presence of additional HLA-like restriction elements. Cold target inhibition of cytolysis mediated by these lines indicated that a shared or cross-reactive MHC controlled restriction element other than the known MHC determinants was retained by the EBV-LCL variants. Single-cell derived clones from these T cell lines which expressed only the TCR-gamma delta showed this same target cell specificity pattern, proving recognition of MHC-controlled determinants by autologous gamma delta T cells. Anti-gamma delta antibody could inhibit cytolysis by the gamma delta-expressing lines, suggesting that the TCR-gamma delta was involved in recognition of the EBV-LCL targets. Flow cytometric analysis with separate HLA-reactive antibodies indicated that the restriction element for these cytolytic responses is a molecule serologically cross-reactive with HLA-B and -C Ag, yet is a determinant that cannot be HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ or -DP.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this work was to compare the efficacy of immunizing mice with a soluble vs a cell-associated form of a tumor Ag. A murine B cell tumor (2C3), which displays an Id on its cell surface, grows progressively and gives rise to Id-negative tumor variants in nonimmunized animals. We previously reported that the tumor variants arise as a consequence of Id-specific T cell suppression of the Id+ tumor. The Id-specific effector T cells are CD4+, CD8-. Based upon these findings vaccination protocols have been designed and tested to determine whether the expansion of tumor-specific effector T cells would eliminate the Id+ tumors and prevent the subsequent generation of Id- tumor variants in vivo. MHC-restricted T cells typically recognize soluble Ag subsequent to modification by an APC, and APC may ultimately express a processed form of the Ag that is different from that expressed on the surface of the tumor cells. Based upon this assumption, the efficacy of immunizing mice with cell-associated 2C3 Id was compared to immunization with a soluble form of the same Id. Mice were immunized with either irradiated 2C3 cells or syngeneic spleen cells to which 2C3 protein was covalently linked. These immunization protocols provided a complete and lasting protection against a tumor challenge of up to 1 x 10(6) tumor cells. In contrast, most mice hyperimmunized with a soluble form of the Id did not survive this level of tumor challenge in spite of the production of significant levels of anti-Id antibodies. Mice immunized with the soluble form of the Id, which did survive, produced slowly progressing tumors expressing a 1000-fold less of the marker Id. These results illustrate the importance of understanding and properly exploiting a host's natural response to a tumor-specific Ag when designing effective immunization protocols for cancer therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether macrophages were directly stimulated by tumor cells to release TNF-alpha. We found that several murine and human tumor cell lines and crude cell membrane vesicles prepared from these tumor cells stimulated pyran copolymer-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages (PEM) to release as much as 362 +/- 69 (mean +/- SE) units of TNF activity per 10(6) PEM in vitro. By contrast, several nontransformed cells, including Con A-stimulated splenic leukocytes and CTLL cloned T lymphocytes, failed to stimulate PEM to release TNF. Antibody and complement-mediated depletion of macrophages abrogated the release of TNF; whereas depletion of NK cells and T lymphocytes did not affect tumor-stimulated TNF release, suggesting that tumor cells directly stimulated PEM to release TNF. Tumor-stimulated TNF release was rapid, peaking in 2 to 3 h with subsequent loss of TNF activity from the medium. In the absence of tumor, PEM contained detectable levels of TNF mRNA, but did not release functionally active TNF. The addition of P815 tumor cell membrane vesicles increased both TNF mRNA levels, peaking at 1 to 2 h, and release of high levels of TNF activity. Confounding effects of endotoxin were excluded by the resistance of tumor-stimulated TNF release to neutralization by polymixin B, and by the equivalent responsiveness of PEM from endotoxin-resistant (C3H/HeJ) and endotoxin-sensitive (C3H/HeN) mice to stimulation by tumor cells. Factors which stimulated PEM to release TNF could be extracted from tumor cell membrane, with 77% of the macrophage-stimulating activity recoverable in aqueous phase. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that some tumor cell lines express specific characteristics which can be recognized by macrophages and which stimulate macrophages to release TNF.\r"

  ".U": "90293489\r", 
  ".W": "The soluble mediators and/or mechanisms involved in immunosuppression in tumor-bearing hosts are not well characterized, although macrophages have long been recognized as major participants. We have investigated the role of lipocortin I, a phospholipid-binding protein, in macrophage-mediated immunosuppression in tumor-bearing mice. Proliferation of splenic lymphocytes in response to the mitogens (PHA, Con A, LPS, and PWM) was severely suppressed in tumor (Sqc-NH-1 carcinoma)-bearing mice. This immunosuppression was associated with a decrease in T and B lymphocytes and an increase in macrophages in these spleens. Mac-2+ macrophages were found only in spleens from tumor-bearing mice. Splenic macrophages from tumor-bearing, but not normal, mice were responsible for this immunosuppression, as revealed by negative and positive selection experiments. The levels of lipocortin I mRNA expression were markedly increased in peripheral blood cells from tumor-bearing mice as compared with those from normal mice. Lipocortin I mRNA was strongly induced in splenic mononuclear cells from tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, these cells displayed increased expression of lipocortin I protein, as judged by Western blot analysis with polyclonal anti-lipocortin I serum. Some nonimmune organs such as the heart, submaxillary gland, muscle, and bladder also displayed increased levels of lipocortin I mRNA expression in tumor-bearing mice. Mac-2+ macrophages among the splenic mononuclear cells in tumor-bearing mice expressed lipocortin I mRNA, as judged by negative and positive selection experiments. Most of these Mac-2+ macrophages also had Mac-1 and Mac-3 Ag. Lipocortin I protein was increased in the serum of tumor-bearing mice as compared with normal mice. The culture supernatants of splenic cells from tumor-bearing mice suppressed the mitogenic responses of splenic cells from normal mice, and addition of anti-lipocortin I antiserum inhibited this suppression. Furthermore, recombinant mouse lipocortin I suppressed mitogenic responses of splenic cells from normal mice. In summary, Mac-2+ macrophage-derived lipocortin I was largely involved in immunosuppression in tumor-bearing mice.\r"

  ".W": "The lymphoma mutant RMA-S escaped graft rejection after transplantation over a minor histocompatibility barrier, whereas it was rejected in H-2 allogeneic mice. The parental control line was rejected in both situations. The mutant, which had been selected against MHC class I molecules retained 5 to 10% of the wild-type H-2Db, Kb, and beta 2-microglobulin expression on the cell surface. It remained sensitive to allo-H-2b CTL in vitro, but was completely resistant to minor histocompatibility antigen-specific, H-2b-restricted CTL. It was equally resistant to other H-2b-restricted responses against internally derived Ag, such as tumor-specific CTL or a CTL clone specific for the influenza virus nucleoprotein. The results indicate a target cell defect that selectively abolishes the sensitivity to H-2-restricted CTL directed against internally processed Ag. This appears sufficient to shift the transplantation response over a minor histocompatibility Ag barrier from rejection to acceptance. There are two possible explanations for the results: 1) a block in the MHC class I-directed pathway for internal Ag processing, and 2) subthreshold H-2/Ag ligand density in relation to triggering requirements of restricted CTL. Regardless of the type of defect, the results demonstrate a difference between allo-H-2-specific and H-2-restricted CTL recognition at the level of the target cell.\r"

  ".U": "90293494\r", 
  ".W": "Given prior evidence that adhesion molecules play critical roles in T cell recognition, it is important to identify new adhesion pathways and explore their role in T cell activation. Our studies of T cell proliferation complement concurrent studies of T cell adhesion; both demonstrate that resting CD4+ human T lymphocytes express the VLA integrins VLA-4, VLA-5, and VLA-6, and can use these receptors to interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins fibronectin (VLA-4 and VLA-5) and laminin (VLA-6). VLA-dependent interaction of resting human CD4+ T cells with fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LN) facilitates CD3-mediated T cell proliferation. Specifically, T cells do not proliferate in response to a wide range of concentrations of a CD3 mAb, OKT3, immobilized on plastic. However, coimmobilization with the CD3 mAb of FN or LN, but not other ECM proteins such as fibrinogen and collagen, consistently results in strong T cell proliferation. mAb blocking studies demonstrate that three VLA integrin receptor/ligand interactions mediate costimulation: VLA-4/FN, VLA-5/FN, and VLA-6/LN. VLA-5-dependent binding to FN but not costimulation by FN can be specifically blocked with peptides containing the RGD (arg-gly-asp) tripeptide sequence whereas VLA-4-dependent binding and costimulation can both be efficiently inhibited by a 12 amino acid peptide, LHGPEILDVPST (leu-his-gly-pro-glu-iso-leu-asp-val-pro-ser-thr), derived from the alternatively spliced IIICS region of FN. The costimulation provided by FN and LN in this system is stronger than and distinct from costimulatory signals provided by cytokines, such as IL-1 beta, IL-6,, and IL-7. These results suggest that, such as other adhesion molecules, T cell VLA integrins may also function in a dual capacity as adhesion and signalling molecules. In addition, they suggest that the interaction of T cells in vivo with ECM via VLA integrins plays a role not only in T cell migratory processes but may also influence Ag-specific T cell recognition.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments have been carried out to assess the immunostimulatory activity of a hamster IgM mAb (mAb5D3) with specificity for an 80-kDa LPS-binding protein expressed on murine macrophages and monocytes. The addition of mAb5D3 to cultures of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages activated these cells to become tumoricidal for mastocytoma cells in vitro. The activity of mAb5D3 was enhanced in the presence of IFN-gamma. Neither mAb5D3 nor LPS were able to activate macrophages from the LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mouse, although these cells responded normally to heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes. The results of several experiments establish that the observed LPS-like activity of mAb5D3 was not due to contaminating endotoxin: 1) the activity of mAb5D3 but not LPS was heat labile at 100 degrees C; 2) the activity of LPS but not mAb5D3, was inhibited by addition of polymyxin B; and 3) quantitative estimates of endotoxin contamination by Limulus amoebocyte lysate reactivity. These experiments thus demonstrate that mAb5D3 can serve as an agonist for LPS-dependent macrophage responses and, when considered with those of our companion paper showing specificity of mAb5D3 for the 80-kDa LPS-binding protein, provide strong support for the concept that the 80-kDa LPS-binding protein previously identified serves as a functional receptor for LPS on murine macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "Molecular and genetic tools have been used to shed light on the genes that contribute to susceptibility to murine lupus and the mechanisms that lead to immunopathology. The MHC genes and their products have been consistently shown to contribute toward the development of disease. To understand the contribution of MHC-class II genes, our laboratory had derived two inbred strains of mice, NZB.H-2bm12 and NZB.H-2b. These new colonies of mice were studied and compared in the 10th generation backcross; inbreeding was serially followed by H-2 typing, responses to beef/porcine insulin, and the presence of the B6 Ig allotype, IgG2ab. Of great interest is the finding that NZB.H-2bm12, in contrast to NZB.H-2b or NZB (H-2d), mice develop high titer autoantibodies to dsDNA. This result is unique because NZB (H-2d) mice, unliked NZB x NZW (NZB/W F1) or NZB x SWR (SNF1) hybrids do not develop autoantibodies to dsDNA, even after immunization. NZB mice, in contrast, are characterized only by autoantibodies to ssDNA. Our observation is also striking because the gene conversion that resulted in the I-A beta bm12 mutation occurred at amino acid residues 68, 71, and 72 of I-E beta b. Recently the contribution of NZW to accelerated autoimmunity in the NZB x NZW F1 hybrid has also been linked to H-2 and a single amino acid change at amino acid 72 of I-E beta. Thus, amino acid residue 72 may be a hot spot for disorders of immune regulation when superimposed on the appropriate genetic background. NZB mice expressing the I-Abm12 mutation will allow specific dissection of the requirements for autoantibody production to dsDNA uncomplicated by heterozygosity.\r"

Blastocysts were transferred to modified Eagle's basal medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for postblastocyst development.

This advantage of Ham's F10 disappeared when amino acids and vitamins were added to the other two media. Whittingham's T6 and human tubal fluid supplemented with human serum albumin, human maternal serum, or human fetal cord serum also supported excellent embryo development. When supplemented with protein, Ham's F10 was the poorest of the media in supporting embryo development.

All 30 subjects achieved hCG concentrations greater than or equal to 10 IU/liter within 2 hr and 19 (63%) did so within 1 hr of injection. The time taken to attain concentrations of greater than or equal to 20 and greater than or equal to 40 IU/liter correlated positively with the subjects' weight and/or surface area, but the correlation was not strong. Eleven of the 15 IVF patients had oocytes retrieved 34-35 + hr post hCG. Three of the 11 showed evidence of prior \"undetected ovulation\" at the time of surgery (definite in one, presumed in two). Taking into consideration the pharmacokinetics of hCG and other factors that could lead to undetected ovulation, the authors conclude that (1) hCG is rapidly absorbed in the majority of subjects following im injection, (2) ovulation may occur earlier than 36 hr following hCG in some individuals, and (3) implementation of a shorter (than 35 hr) hCG-to-oocyte retrieval interval would be advised if undetected ovulation is to be avoided.\r"

It has been suggested that such a phenomenon might adversely affect the success of in vitro fertilization. This prospective study was designed to assess the effect of transient rises in prolactin levels on the endocrine response to ovarian stimulation and the outcome of in vitro fertilization treatment. A total of 90 treatment cycles in 87 couples was studied. Prolactin was measured in the mid and late follicular phases of the cycles. During the study period, 24 pregnancies occurred. There were no differences in those cycles in which pregnancy did or did not occur in either mid or late follicular prolactin levels. Neither the initial level nor the percentage rise in prolactin during the stimulation had any effect on the peak estradiol level achieved, the numbers of follicles seen, the number of eggs retrieved, or the incidence or outcome of pregnancy. It was concluded that transient hyperprolactinemia is of no significance in ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization.\r"

Pregnancy resulted in 31.1% of patients following the GIFT treatment. The overall in vitro fertilization (IVF) rate of supernumerary oocytes was significantly higher in those who became pregnant (41.2%) than in patients who did not (34.9%). However, the failure to fertilize any supernumerary oocytes was not significantly different between those becoming pregnant (27.6%) and those in whom the treatment failed (37.3%). Failure to fertilize any supernumerary oocytes in vitro was of a higher rate if suboptimal sperm preparation was used or if only one oocyte was left over for in vitro insemination following the GIFT treatment. We concluded that the in vitro fertilization rate was higher in the pregnant group, but the total failure to fertilize or the fertilization of any supernumerary oocytes does not predict the outcome of GIFT. Embryos resulting following fertilization of excess oocytes may be cryopreserved for subsequent use.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty patients with advanced melanoma received high-dose bolus and continuous infusion interleukin-2 (IL-2) with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells in an attempt to improve the therapeutic index of this active but toxic therapy. Treatment began with up to nine bolus doses of IL-2 administered over 3 days. After 1 day of rest, patients underwent daily leukapheresis for 4 days, and the leukocytes were cultured with IL-2 in vitro to prepare LAK cells. Continuous infusion IL-2 was begun 1 day after the last leukapheresis and continued for up to 148 hours; LAK cells were administered on days 1, 2, and 4 of the infusion. Responding patients were eligible to receive up to two additional cycles of therapy at 3-month intervals. Most patients completed each cycle without dose reduction. One patient had a complete response and six patients had partial responses (14% response rate). The complete responder and three of the partial responders (8%) remain free from disease progression with follow-up of 21 to 24 months. Of these four patients with durable remissions, one had extensive liver and lymph node metastases, one had lymph node, pleural, and parenchymal lung metastases, and two had disease limited to lymph nodes or subcutaneous tissues. Seventeen patients (34%) required pressors for hypotension, three patients (6%) developed hemodynamically significant arrhythmias, and six patients (12%) developed dyspnea at rest, but none required intubation and there were no treatment-related deaths. Unacceptable toxicity developed in two patients during bolus IL-2 administration and therapy was aborted; both returned to baseline status within 4 days of discontinuing IL-2. Fever, oliguria, and elevated creatinine or transaminase levels occurred frequently but were also transient. Despite less frequent severe toxicity with this modified regimen, these results confirm the ability of IL-2 and LAK cell therapy to induce durable remissions in some patients with advanced melanoma.\r"

  ".U": "90293803\r", 
  ".W": "Bone marrow specimens from 317 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) obtained at initial staging were evaluated for the presence of lymphoma or benign lymphoid aggregates. Thirty-two percent (102 patients) had lymphoma in their bone marrow, and 9% had benign lymphoid aggregates. Bone marrow lymphoma was present in 39% of low-grade, 36% of intermediate-grade, and 18% of high-grade lymphomas. The bone marrow was involved in 25% of patients with diffuse large-cell or immunoblastic NHL (ie, diffuse histiocytic lymphoma of Rappaport). Bone marrow involvement did not affect survival of patients with low-grade NHL, but survival was significantly shorter (P = .03) for patients with intermediate- and high-grade NHL with bone marrow involvement. Bone marrow involvement was equally common in B-cell and T-cell NHL (31% v 32%). However, patients with T-cell NHL and bone marrow involvement had shorter survival than B-cell NHL with marrow involvement (P = .02) or T-cell NHL without marrow involvement (P = .05). A high incidence of morphologic discordance between lymph node and bone marrow was observed (ie, 40%), always with a more aggressive subtype in the lymph node than in the bone marrow. Presence of large-cell lymphoma in the bone marrow predicted for short survival. Survival for patients with small-cell lymphoma in their bone marrow did not differ significantly from patients with negative bone marrows. We conclude that bone marrow involvement in large-cell NHL, especially in those of T-cell origin, portends a poor prognosis. However, the subgroup of patients with an aggressive histologic subtype of NHL in a lymph node biopsy and small-cell NHL in the bone marrow do not have a poorer outlook than those without bone marrow involvement.\r"

  ".W": "The initial promising results with alternating chemotherapy regimens (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone/doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine [MOPP/ABVD]; lomustine, melphalan, and vindesine [CAD] plus MOPP plus ABV) combined with intermediate-dose radiation therapy (RT) have been sustained with further follow-up; 82.2% of patients (152 of 185) achieved a complete remission (CR), and overall survival is 71.7% +/- 4.4% at 8 years (median follow-up is 55 months among the survivors). No statistically significant differences were found in CR percentage, CR duration, or survival between stages IIB, IIIB, and IV patients. For that reason, stepwise Cox regression analyses to identify the important prognostic factors were performed on overall survival, tumor mortality, freedom from disease progression, and survival following disease progression. Pretreatment characteristics were also tested for association with the probability of achieving CR, CR duration, and death due to other causes. Characteristics that were consistently associated with an independently unfavorable prognosis were low hematocrit, high serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), age more than 45 years, inguinal node involvement, mediastinal mass greater than .45 of the thoracic diameter, and bone marrow involvement. Patients with two or more unfavorable characteristics were much more likely to fail treatment (median survival, 62.4 months) than those with none or only one unfavorable factor (greater than 95% survival). This striking difference between the low- and high-risk groups remained even if the comparison was restricted to patients less than or equal to 45 years of age. These results provide a basis for selecting the young patients at high risk of failure for more intensive initial treatment with either autologous bone marrow rescue or hematopoietic growth factors.\r"

Twenty-eight of the 39 children had sufficient serial testing for evaluation of ototoxicity secondary to cisplatin. Following the third cisplatin treatment (300 mg/m2 cumulative dose), 20% of the assessable children had hearing loss limited to the high frequencies of 6,000 to 8,000 Hz, 16% had hearing loss beginning at 3,000 to 4,000 Hz, and three children (11%) had loss within the speech frequencies beginning at 1,000 to 2,000 Hz. Eighteen of 19 children (95%) who were evaluated comparatively at a median of 15 months following radiation showed no significant change from preradiation testing. There was no correlation between hearing loss and patient age. We conclude that cisplatin ototoxicity was acceptable and that radiation therapy does not increase the ototoxicity of cisplatin when the drug is given before, instead of following, cranial irradiation.\r"

  ".W": "Results of postremission chemotherapy for adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were assessed in two sequential prospective studies involving similar induction therapy and two courses of intensive consolidation treatment. Fifty-six patients achieving remission on the acute leukemia protocol (ALP3) study received high-dose cytarabine and daunorubicin as course one and standard-dose cytarabine and daunorubicin as course two. Results are compared with forty-six patients achieving remission on the ALP2 study who received azacitidine and doxorubicin as consolidation course one and standard-dose cytarabine, daunorubicin, and thioguanine as course two. The ALP3 regimen resulted in a significantly improved 5-year disease-free survival of 32% +/- 19% versus 20% +/- 11% for the ALP2 study (P = .03). Survival from remission was also improved, 40% +/- 14% versus 24% +/- 12% (P less than .01). Favorable prognostic factors for disease-free survival included receiving the ALP3 treatment regimen, absence of a prior preleukemic syndrome, and female sex. These factors and younger patient age were significant for survival following first chemotherapy and survival after achieving remission. Six of 34 patients who relapsed after receiving the ALP3 regimen successfully achieved prolonged second remissions with high-dose cytarabine-based chemotherapy and/or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Overall survival for adults less than or equal to 45 years of age was 58% +/- 19% with the ALP3 postremission chemotherapy regimen, comparable to most studies of BMT for AML in first remission. Actuarial 5-year survival for ALP3 patients greater than 60 years of age was 18% +/- 20% with no improvement compared with ALP2.\r"

Patients received a median of four courses of induction chemotherapy and if stable or responding received two courses of intensive therapy with cyclophosphamide 4.5 to 5.25 g/m2, etoposide 750 to 1,200 mg/m2, and cisplatin 120 to 180 mg/m2 (CVP). The complete remission (CR) rate after completion of the induction and intensive phases was 55%. Median progression-free interval from induction is 57 weeks with a projected 2-year progression-free survival of approximately 25%. Six of seven patients followed for greater than 2 years are still progression-free. Three favorable features predicted for improved progression-free survival are the following: (1) absent liver involvement, (2) absent soft tissue involvement, and (3) less than or equal to two disease sites (P values of .001, .013, and .048, respectively). Hormonal and menopausal status did not predict for progression-free survival. Major toxicities were infectious secondary to neutropenia, with a 93% incidence of fever and a 38% incidence of sepsis. The treatment-related mortality rate was 9%, with three infectious, one coronary, and one late hemorrhage-related death of unknown cause. Longer follow-up is still needed to truly evaluate the possibility of long-term disease-free survival, but further studies of this approach to high-dose intensification in poor prognostic groups of stage IV breast cancer appear warranted.\r"

One hundred thirty-seven courses with a median number of five courses (range, one to six) were administered. Preoperative EFP resulted in 17 (49%) major responses, including six patients who did not have carcinoma cells in the repeat endoscopic biopsy specimens and cytologic brushings. Among 32 patients who had surgery, 25 (78%) had curative resection, one patient had a complete pathologic response, and one had microscopic carcinoma in the resected specimen. Six patients had microscopic carcinoma at the resection margins and received postoperative radiotherapy. At a median follow-up of 20 months, the projected survival of 35 patients is 23 months (range, 6 to 33+). Fifteen patients died of their carcinomas, and 15 patients were alive (median follow-up, 20+ months; range, 15+ to 33+ months) with no evidence of relapse. There were no deaths related to chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy. EFP-induced toxic reactions were moderate. Our data suggest that multiple courses of EFP are feasible. Future strategies for this disease should consider prolonged chemotherapy with regimens that result frequently in pathologic complete responses.\r"

One hundred sixty-five children presenting to Yale-New Haven Hospital with a malignancy diagnosed between January 1, 1981 and December 31, 1985 were followed through June 30, 1986 for the number of treatment-related complications resulting in hospitalization. The time on therapy totaled 80,089 person-days that were divided into 510 periods of observation defined by the presence or absence of a RAC, disease status (remission, partial remission, or relapse), intensity of chemotherapy (using a 0 to 4 scale), and use of radiation therapy. Children with RACs experienced markedly higher rates of sepsis (14-fold higher, P less than .0001) and catheter-site infection or other catheter complications requiring hospitalization (both greater than 30-fold higher, P less than .0001). These effects persisted after controlling for other risk factors, ie, disease status, chemotherapy intensity, and age. Children with RACs also had higher rates of fever and neutropenia and other infections requiring hospitalization that were more strongly influenced by the other risk factors. The association of RACs with sepsis, fever and neutropenia, and days hospitalized for treatment-related complications was assessed using multivariable analysis methods to control for disease status, intensity of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, type of cancer, age, and sex. The presence of a RAC (rate ratio [RR], 6.39; P less than .0001) and the disease status (RR, 2.45; P = .0004) were the only factors that predicted sepsis. Fever and neutropenia rates were most influenced by chemotherapy intensity (RR, 2.31; P = .0001) and age (RR, 0.94; P = .013 per year of age) and less by the presence of a RAC (RR, 1.56; P = .053). Controlling for other risk factors, children with RACs experienced a 6.4-times higher rate of sepsis and spent an average of 15.4 more days per year in the hospital for treatment-related complications.\r"

Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) have been one of the toxicities observed with administration of this drug. Of 301 patients treated, 32 patients have had definite (27 patients) or possible (five patients) hypersensitivity reactions to taxol. All but one patient had the reaction from the first or second exposure to this agent. Reactions occurred at a variety of doses and were characterized most frequently by dyspnea, hypotension, bronchospasm, urticaria, and erythematous rashes. Thirteen (41%) patients had received premedication designed to prevent such toxicity; nevertheless, they sustained HSRs. Prolonging the drug infusion appears to have somewhat reduced, but not obviated, the risk of HSRs. The cause (taxol itself or its excipient Cremophor EL; Badische Anilin und Soda-Fabrik AG [BASF], Ludwigshafen, Federal Republic of Germany) and the mechanism of these reactions to taxol are unknown. We provide guidelines to prevent or minimize such toxicity and treat reactions if they still occur.\r"

  ".W": "We suggest \"new\" response criteria for phase II studies of supratentorial malignant glioma and favor rigorous criteria similar to those in medical oncology, with important modifications. Four response categories are proposed: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD). Response in this scheme is based on major changes in tumor size on the enhanced computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Scan changes are interpreted in light of steroid use and neurologic findings. We advocate careful patient selection, emphasize pitfalls in the assessment of response, and suggest guidelines to minimize misinterpretations of response.\r"

Of the 34 sides, 13 cysts involved the sinus completely. Twelve were multilocular. Thirteen exhibited incomplete septae. Perforations were most frequent in the anterolateral and medial bony walls (28 and 27, respectively); however, the 14 posterolateral wall perforations showed a higher percentage of cystic projection into adjacent structures. Ethmoid extension was seen on two sides, orbital extension on one. Nine sides showed tooth roots communicating with the cyst. The routine use of computed tomography in the evaluation of this type of cyst is proposed.\r"

One hundred consecutive patients who underwent maxillary repositioning by means of Le Fort I osteotomy were selected. In all patients the unoperated mandible was used to provide anteroposterior and transverse maxillary position and measurements made on the lateral wall of the maxilla (internal reference points, IRP) to determine the maxillary vertical dimension. Tracings of all cranial structures were made of the preoperative cephalograms and superimposed on the postoperative cephalogram and on the prediction tracing using cranial base structures. Points were digitized to compare the preoperative, postoperative, and predicted position of the maxillary central incisor and first molar of each patient by computer. Comparison between the predicted and actual change in the position of the incisor and molar was calculated. Statistical analysis showed that there were significant differences between the predicted and actual change in vertical and horizontal position of both the incisor and the molar (P less than .0001). The results of this investigation indicate that the ability to determine vertical repositioning of the maxilla with internal reference lines is limited.\r"

The age range was 2 to 17 years (median, 7.2 years), and 77.4% were males. The most common presenting symptoms were detectable masses, floating and/or painful teeth, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, sore throat, and neurologic signs. The predominant primary tumor sites were the jaws and tonsils. All patients were staged by a clinical staging system, 17 of them having stage I-II, and 14 stage III-IV. Levels of lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin were the only significant laboratory parameters correlating with initial staging and disease-free survival. Radiologic features in the jaws were poorly circumscribed destructive lytic lesions with migration and crypt destruction of unerupted teeth buds. Complete disappearance of these findings was noted after successful chemotherapy and clinical regression of the tumor. Eighteen (58.1%) patients attained complete remission with a follow-up of 5 to 100 months. Stage was the most significant variable affecting outcome, with 90.2% disease-free survival of stage I patients, 72.4% of stage II, and 18.2% of stage III-IV. Based on these results, it is concluded that localized (stage I and II) Burkitt's lymphoma is responsive to chemotherapy and thus has a favorable prognosis.\r"

Three orofacial and two upper extremity nerves were examined. Each nerve was transected and labeled with horseradish peroxidase to identify the cell bodies of neurons contributing axons to the nerve. The study included two trials per nerve, for a total of 10 trials in eight cats. The trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia, containing sensory neurons (SN), and the stellate, middle, and superior cervical ganglia, containing postganglionic sympathetic neurons (PGSN), were sectioned and reacted with tetramethyl benzidine to visualize the labeled neurons. The total number of labeled PGSN and SN were counted and the ratio (PGSN:SN) determined for each of the five nerves. The average PGSN:SN ratio from upper extremity nerves (0.40) is 2 1/2 times greater than the ratio determined for branches of the trigeminal nerve (0.16). The lower proportion of sympathetic neurons within the trigeminal nerves provides an anatomic explanation for the lower incidence of orofacial causalgia consistent with the currently accepted etiology.\r"

  ".W": "Gastric function was evaluated in rhesus monkeys during a continuous, s.c. infusion of three kappa agonists; dynorphin-(1-13), (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl] benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate hydrate) (U50,488H) and ketocyclazocine (KETO). A dye dilution technique was used to determine gastric fractional emptying rate, hydrogen ion, sodium ion and fluid secretion after the intragastric administration of a water meal. All agonists significantly inhibited fractional emptying rate after the water meal. The kappa receptor antagonist, (-)-(1R,5R,9R)-5,9-dimethyl-2-(3-furylmethyl)-2'-hydroxy-6,7-benzomor pha n methanesulfonate, prevented the inhibitory response to dynorphin-(1-13) and partially blocked the effect of KETO, but, at the dose used in the present study, was completely ineffective against the specific kappa agonist, U50,488H. This suggests that dynorphin-(1-13) and U50,488H may not bind to the same kappa receptor isotype. The partial antagonism of KETO by both naloxone and (-)-(1R,5R,9R)-5,9-dimethyl-2-(3-furylmethyl)-2'-hydroxy-6,7-benzomor pha n methanesulfonate is consistent with a kappa/mu effect of this compound. Naloxone, at the dose used in these studies, did not modify the response to U50,488H. In contrast to their inhibitory action on gastric emptying, the kappa agonists, dynorphin-(1-13) and U50,488H, did not alter acid secretion. The suppressive action of KETO on acid secretion may be due to activation of mu receptors. The inhibitory effect of dynorphin-(1-13) on sodium output was blocked by (-)-(1R,5R,9R)-5,9-dimethyl-2-(3-furylmethyl)-2'-hydroxy-6,7-benzomor pha n methanesulfonate, suggesting a role for kappa agonists in the control of nonparietal secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The antiemetic and locomotor effects of two substituted benzamides, zacopride and batanopride (BMY25801), were compared in ferrets after bilateral 60Co irradiation at 2, 4 or 6 Gy. Both zacopride and BMY25801 were effective against emesis and related signs. Zacopride, tested at several doses (0.003, 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg), appeared to be more potent because it abolished emesis at 100-fold lower doses than did BMY25801 (3 mg/kg). The ED50 value for the antiemetic effect of zacopride was 0.026 mg/kg (confidence levels = 0.0095, 0.072 mg/kg). However, analysis of emetic parameters recorded from vomiting animals (e.g., latency to first emesis) demonstrated that BMY25801 provided greater antiemetic protection in this population than zacopride without any apparent side effects. Locomotor activity was significantly depressed by both radiation (all doses) and zacopride alone (0.03 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg). BMY25801 alone did not affect locomotor activity, and protected against the radiation-induced locomotor decrement. Although zacopride potentiated the locomotor decrement to radiation, no clear dose-response relationship was evident. Bilateral abdominal vagotomy significantly increased the latency to the first emetic episode and significantly reduced the number of retches, but did not alter the duration of the prodromal response to 4-Gy irradiation. Unilateral vagotomies had no effect. Zacopride (at 0.03 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg) remained an effective antiemetic in animals that received a bilateral vagotomy, abolishing emesis in four of eight and two of eight ferrets, respectively. These data suggest that the antiemetic action of zacopride does not fully depend on intact vagal innervation and also acts via other pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Three antiemetic compounds (zacopride, batanopride, granisetron [BRL43694]) were evaluated for the production of gastrointestinal side effects in the conscious ferret after i.v. or p.o. administration. Zacopride evoked multiple emetic and defecatory responses at clinically relevant doses (0.003-0.3 mg/kg) and in a dose-dependent manner. The oral route was the more potent one for eliciting emesis (ED50 0.033 mg/kg). At 0.3 mg/kg p.o., zacopride reliably evoked an 80 to 100% incidence of emesis and a 40 to 80% incidence of defecation. In contrast, batanopride and BRL43694 i.v. evoked a small (10%) incidence of these side effects, but only at 0.1 to 10 mg/kg doses. When given p.o. (0.00003-10 mg/kg), these latter compounds never evoked emesis and significantly reduced (P less than .05) the incidence of defecation below that of vehicle. Responses to zacopride (0.3 mg/kg p.o.) were challenged by i.p. pretreatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist 2-methyl serotonin, the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist BRL43694, the quaternary atropine derivative glycopyrrolate, the dopamine receptor antagonist domperidone or selective abdominal vagotomies. All compounds and either bilateral or dorsal vagotomy significantly reduced the incidence of emesis, but did not abolish it. Latency to first emesis was delayed by BRL43694, domperidone or dorsal vagotomy. The data suggest that the emetic response to p.o. zacopride is mediated in part by 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors residing on either enteric neurons or vagal afferents. However, the underlying pharmacology of the response may also include activation of cholinergic and dopaminergic pathways.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics, metabolism and pharmacodynamics of verapamil (160 mg p.o. of a pseudoracemic mixture) were evaluated in six healthy volunteers before and after coadministration of cimetidine (400 mg b.i.d.). Enantiomers of verapamil and enantiomers of three major urinary metabolites (norverapamil, D-617 and D-620) were determined in plasma and urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Coadministration of cimetidine led to a significant increase in the area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve of S-verapamil (29.2 +/- 31.8 min x nmol x ml-1 vs. 41.2 +/- 33.7 min x nmol x ml-1; P less than .003) and R-verapamil (124.7 +/- 112.2 min x nmol x ml-1 vs. 156.8 +/- 105.0 min x nmol x ml-1; P less than .01). The increase was significantly greater for the pharmacologically more potent S-enantiomer compared to R-verapamil (150.3 +/- 37 vs. 117.8 +/- 15%; P less than .05). As a consequence, coadministration of cimetidine increased the negative dromotropic effect of verapamil on atrioventricular conduction in five of six subjects. In addition, fractional metabolic clearance to D-620 and D-617 decreased for both enantiomers. Tubular secretion of S-D-617 was inhibited by cimetidine (342 +/- 104 vs. 238 +/- 52 ml x min-1; P less than .05) whereas secretion of the R-enantiomer remained unchanged (276 +/- 91 vs. 222 +/- 43 ml x min-1). Thus, cimetidine interacts with both hepatic and renal verapamil elimination in a stereoselective manner. The increase in total plasma concentration of verapamil combined with an increase in eutomer/distomer ratio produces a more pronounced pharmacological effect of verapamil when cimetidine is coadministered.\r"

  ".W": "Previous results from our laboratory (White and Carrier, Enhanced Vascular Alpha-Adrenergic Neuroeffector System in Diabetes: Importance of Calcium. Am. J. Physiol. 255: H1036-1042, 1988) demonstrated that mesenteric arteries from streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats exhibit an enhanced responsiveness to alpha adrenergic agonists. The present study demonstrates that this enhanced responsiveness is dependent upon the presence of extracellular calcium. Arteries from STZ-diabetic (10-12 weeks) rats developed greater contractile force in response to norepinephrine or KCl. Development of these effects was prevented by daily insulin treatment, indicating these alterations are related to the diabetic state. Similarly, the contractile response to extracellular calcium in the presence of norepinephrine (3 x 10(-6) M) or KCl (60 mM) was greater in arteries from STZ-diabetic animals. BAY K 8644, a calcium channel agonist, induced greater contraction in arteries from STZ-diabetic animals, as did activation of protein kinase C by phorbol dibutyrate. In contrast, contraction induced by release of calcium from intracellular sources (alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated or caffeine-induced) was unaltered by diabetes. These findings indicate that enhanced vascular contraction in STZ-diabetes is of a nonspecific nature, i.e., the contractile response to any agent which induces extracellular calcium-dependent contraction should be enhanced in diabetes. We propose that STZ-diabetes enhances the activity and/or number of calcium ion channels in vascular smooth muscle.\r"

  ".U": "90294092\r", 
  ".W": "The Ca(++)-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine was used in these studies to investigate presynaptic regulation of norepinephrine release. In hippocampal synaptosomes, previously unexposed to Ca++ during isolation and superfusion, 1.25 mM Ca++ evoked a modest (4 to 7% of total stores) release of [3H]norepinephrine with 4.5 mM [K+] present. The alpha-2 adrenergic agonist clonidine inhibited 60% of the Ca(++)-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release. The alpha-2 adrenergic antagonists idazoxan and yohimbine reversed clonidine inhibition of release whereas the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin did not. Increasing the [K+] before Ca++ exposure increased [3H]norepinephrine release, and at 20 [K+] the release increased to over 20% of total stores. However, at [K+] above 9 mM, inhibition of Ca(++)-evoked release by clonidine decreased, and by 20 mM [K+] clonidine no longer inhibited release. Release was unaffected by 5 microM idazoxan or the opiate antagonist naloxone at 15 or 20 mM [K+]. The K+ channel blockers tetraethylammonium (5 mM) and 4-aminopyridine (0.1 mM) increased Ca(++)-evoked release almost 4-fold above control (4.5 mM [K+] present). Neither clonidine nor idazoxan affected Ca(++)-evoked release with the K+ channel blockers present. Therefore, even though K+ channel blockers and 20 mM [K+] increase neurotransmitter release, it is not autoreceptor activation by released endogenous norepinephrine that is responsible for blocking alpha-2 inhibition, but the depolarization produced by these treatments. The 20 mM [K+] blockade of alpha-2 inhibition was decreased by lowering the [Ca++] in the superfusion buffer. Therefore, synaptosomal accumulation of Ca++ may partially explain the loss of alpha-2 inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Effects of E-4031, a class III antiarrhythmic agent, on re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias were studied in eight dogs with a 7-day-old myocardial infarction. Epicardial mapping and local refractory periods were obtained using 47-channel bipolar electrodes attached to the epicardium. The induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia by programmed electrical stimulation was not suppressed by i.v. infusion of E-4031 at 1 microgram/kg/min, but was suppressed markedly by infusion at 10 micrograms/kg/min in six of seven dogs. During the infusion of E-4031 at 10 micrograms/kg/min, epicardial conduction velocity in the normal ventricle did not change (0.7 +/- 0.12 to 0.71 +/- 0.13 m/sec, n = 6), whereas slowed conduction in the infarct zone improved (0.58 +/- 0.10 to 0.77 +/- 0.13 m/sec, n = 6). E-4031 at 10 micrograms/kg/min prolonged effective refractory periods (ERP) in the normal zone (139 +/- 8 to 164 +/- 18 msec, P less than .01, n = 8), nontransmural infarct zone (145 +/- 7 to 177 +/- 15 msec, P less than .01, n = 8) and transmural infarct zone (156 +/- 14 to 191 +/- 22 msec, P less than .01, n = 8). The degrees of ERP prolongation were almost equal in all zones. On epicardial mapping, the areas of longer ERP and delayed conduction were observed to become inexcitable after the administration of E-4031. These results demonstrated that E-4031 effectively prevented the induction of re-entrant ventricular tachycardia in canine myocardial infarction model, and suggested that E-4031 rendered re-entrant circuits inexcitable by marked ERP prolongation in both normal and infarct zones.\r"

Vasoconstrictor responses evoked by nanomolar concentrations of ADO and N6-cyclohexyladenosine were enhanced when local skin temperature (Ts) was increased, but unchanged when Ts was decreased. All these responses were antagonized by 8-phenyltheophylline, which suggests that temperature-sensitive vasoconstrictions were mediated by A1 receptors. In contrast, norepinephrine (10(-7) M) caused vasoconstrictions that were not enhanced at high Ts and were markedly reduced at low Ts, while angiotensin II (10(-8) M) caused vasoconstrictions that were temperature-insensitive. Vasodilator responses evoked by micromolar concentrations of ADO, 2-chloroadenosine and 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)-adenosine were temperature-insensitive. All these responses were antagonized by 8-phenyltheophylline, except those mediated by 10(-6) to 10(-4) M ADO, which can be explained by simple override of the receptor blockade. Thus, A1, but not A2, receptors show temperature-dependent actions in vivo, which suggests that temperature sensitivity could be an additional criterion for classification of ADO receptors.\r"

For comparison, the electrophysiological effects of BRL 34915 were also examined in normal Purkinje fibers in which the potassium conductance had been reduced by barium. In normal Purkinje fibers, BRL 34915 produced a concentration-dependent shortening of action potential duration (APD) without change in the maximum diastolic potential, action potential amplitude or maximum upstroke velocity. A similar shortening of APD was observed in Purkinje fibers surviving infarction and in barium-treated Purkinje fibers. The reduction of APD by BRL 34915 was more pronounced at a longer cycle length of stimulation than at a shorter cycle length. In normal Purkinje fibers and in Purkinje fibers surviving infarction, depolarizations produced by low external potassium (1 mM) were attenuated by the drug, whereas there were little or no effects on high potassium (4-8 mM)-induced depolarization. Barium-treated Purkinje fibers when depolarized by 1 mM potassium were not sensitive to the hyperpolarizing effect of BRL 34915. It is proposed that the unique electrophysiological activity of BRL 34915 in canine Purkinje fibers is related to an increase in the potassium currents, ix1, ik1, and the ATP-sensitive potassium current in these fibers.\r"

Anesthetized open-chest dogs treated with vehicle or 1 mg/kg + 1 mg/kg/hr SQ 30,741, i.v. (starting 10 min after the onset of ischemia) were subjected to 90 min left circumflex coronary occlusion and 3 hr reperfusion. Regional myocardial blood flow (radioactive microspheres) and arterial and venous O2 saturations (microspectrophotometry) were determined. Animals treated with SQ 30,741 had significantly higher subendocardial reflow at 3 hr (48 +/- 6 ml/min/100 g) compared with vehicle (27 +/- 10 ml/min/100 g). At 3 hr postreperfusion, O2 extraction was significantly higher in the reperfused region compared with the nonischemic region, although extraction was not at maximal values. O2 extraction was similar in vehicle- and SQ 30,741-treated animals despite the near doubling of reflow into the subendocardial region with SQ 30,741. O2 consumption was significantly reduced in the reperfused subendocardial region (1.65 +/- 0.9 ml O2/min/100 g) in vehicle controls compared with the nonischemic subendocardial region (10.2 +/- 2.6 ml O2/min/100 g). SQ 30,741 significantly improved subendocardial reperfused regional O2 consumption (4.03 +/- 0.41 ml O2/min/100 g) compared with vehicle and this increase was proportional to the flow increment (no change in the O2 supply/consumption ratio). SQ 30,741 is thus increasing subendocardial reflow secondary to an increase in O2 consumption and the increased O2 consumption may be due to preservation of myocardial tissue.\r"

Deferoxamine blocks iron-catalyzed hydroxyl radical formation in vitro. Groups of dogs received either pretreatment with deferoxamine or iron-loaded deferoxamine (15 mg/kg over 30 min preocclusion and 2.5 mg/kg/hr during the first 120 min of reperfusion), equal volumes of saline or deferoxamine treatment during reperfusion (15 mg/kg over 30 min beginning at 75 min of occlusion followed by 2.5 mg/kg/hr during the remainder of the first 120 min of reperfusion). Infarct size as a percentage of area at risk was reduced (P less than .05) by deferoxamine pretreatment (29.8 +/- 4.8%, n = 7, +/- S.E.) compared to saline control (46.8 +/- 4.7%, n = 8), deferoxamine reperfusion (50.5 +/- 6.7%, n = 8) or iron-loaded deferoxamine (60.2 +/- 8.6%, n = 3)-treated dogs. Deferoxamine pretreatment also decreased (P less than .05) the release of oxidized glutathione into the coronary sinus during early reperfusion compared to the other groups. There were no differences between groups in area at risk, risk zone blood flow during ischemia or in heart rate-blood pressure product. Deferoxamine did not decrease hydrogen peroxide concentration, neutrophil superoxide anion production or neutrophil adherence in vitro. We conclude that iron-mediated processes, possibly including iron-catalyzed hydroxyl radical formation, contribute to myocardial necrosis during regional ischemia and reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Furosemide was administered as either an i.v. bolus (6 mg/kg) or primed continuous infusion (4 mg/kg/hr) with quantitative fluid replacement to 10 3-day-old and 9 18-day old piglets. Total and unbound plasma as well as urinary furosemide concentrations were measured for up to 6 hr and drug disposition and renal sodium excretory dynamics were compared at the two ages. The plasma clearance of furosemide was concentration-independent over the range studied (0.1-10 mg/l). Steady-state volume of distribution and unbound fraction of furosemide in plasma were both considerably higher in the younger piglets (618 +/- 320 vs. 201 +/- 71 ml/kg, p less than .01 and 0.22 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.02 ml/kg, p less than .001, respectively) while unbound secretory clearance was several-fold lower in this age group (49.2 +/- 23 vs. 107 +/- 55 ml/min/kg, P less than .01). A log-logistic equation was fitted to sigmoidal plots of sodium excretion rate vs. log furosemide excretion rate. While basal response and slope parameters did not differ significantly, maximal response and stimulus required for half-maximal response were both reduced in the younger piglets (0.70 +/- 0.24 vs. 1.18 +/- 0.30 mmol/min and 0.06 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.14 +/- 0.06 mumol/min, respectively, P less than 0.05). Thus, younger piglets were more sensitive to the natriuretic effects of the drug. While term piglets were useful for studying the maturation of protein binding and renal drug excretory processes for furosemide, drug disposition was not comparable to that in human premature infants because of the higher secretory capability of the piglet.\r"

  ".W": "Recent experiments have demonstrated that pharmacological activation of central noradrenergic systems by monoaminergic stimulators or uptake blockers or through the stimulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors improved cataplexy, a major symptom of narcolepsy. In order to further the understanding of the control of cataplexy by noradrenergic mechanisms, the involvement of central alpha-2 adrenoceptors was examined in genetically narcoleptic Doberman pinschers using in vivo pharmacology. Yohimbine (1.5-96.0 micrograms/kg i.v.) and seven other selective and centrally acting alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists (rauwolscine: 1.5-96 micrograms/kg i.v.; atipemazole: 1.5-96 micrograms/kg i.v.; Wy-25309: 1.5-386 micrograms/kg i.v.; CGS-7525A: 1.5-386 micrograms/kg i.v.; idazoxan, 6-1536 micrograms/kg i.v.; piperoxan, 6-1536 micrograms/kg i.v.; and mianserin, 6-1536 micrograms/kg i.v.) significantly suppressed cataplexy. The alpha-2 mediation of this effect was demonstrated by a close correlation between drug affinities (Ki) toward the alpha-2 site (defined using [3H]yohimbine in canine cortex) and the ability of these drugs to reduce cataplexy [ED50 in nanomoles per kilogram i.v.) (r2 = 0.71, n = 8, P less than .01). The effects of six centrally acting alpha-2 agonists on canine cataplexy were also examined and two groups of compounds were distinguished on the basis of their pharmacological profile. Classical alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine (0.0625-4.0 micrograms/kg i.v.), p-aminoclonidine (0.0625-4.0 micrograms/kg i.v.) and guanfacine (0.0625-4.0 micrograms/kg i.v.) had no effect on cataplexy whereas BHT-920 (0.01875-3.0 micrograms/kg i.v.), BHT-933 (16.0-258 micrograms/kg i.v.) and xylazine (16.0-258 micrograms/kg i.v.) dramatically aggravated cataplexy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma and cortex clonazepam concentrations, rotarod ataxia and in vivo benzodiazepine receptor occupancy were measured at multiple times up to 14 hr after dosage. Elimination of clonazepam from plasma and cortex became slower with age, but cortex concentrations always exceeded those in plasma. The mean ratio was 1.82, and was not influenced by age. Rotarod ataxia was quantitatively greater and of longer duration in aging animals. This was not explained entirely by kinetic changes, as ataxia at any given cortex clonazepam concentration or degree of receptor occupancy was greater in 1-year-old animals than in those age 6 weeks or 6 months. In a second study, 6-week and 1-year-old animals were tested at a fixed time (1 hr) after variable doses of clonazepam (0.01-2.0 mg/kg); findings were consistent with results from the fixed-dose study. In vitro studies evaluated benzodiazepine receptor binding, chloride channel binding and muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake in cortical membrane preparations from animals of the four age groups. Binding affinity and number of binding sites were not influenced by age, or was gamma-aminobutyric acid-dependent muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake (either with or without addition of lorazepam) significantly related to age. Thus, increased overall sensitivity of aging animals to the central depressant effects of clonazepam is evident in the described model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90294106\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of D-2 dopamine (DA) receptor blockade were modulated by ICI 169,369, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2 receptor antagonist, and by other 5-HT2 antagonists. Specifically, it appears that blockade of 5-HT2 receptors can attenuate the effects of D-2 receptor blockade on rat striatal dopaminergic transmission. Thus, the blockade of D-2 receptors by haloperidol results in a compensatory increase in rat striatal DA metabolism, which is enhanced by ICI 169,369. By itself, ICI 169,369 did not significantly alter DA metabolism. Conversely, several compounds which possess appreciable activity at 5-HT2 sites in ex vivo binding assays, but possess little activity at D-2 sites (i.e., pirenperone, setoperone, fluperlapine and clozapine), all produced large increases in striatal DA metabolism. Therefore, these data suggest that the 5-HT2 component of these compounds, by enhancing DA metabolism, may act to attenuate the blockade of striatal D-2 receptors by these compounds. Consistent with this hypothesis, the chronic blockade of D-2 receptors by haloperidol increases the number of striatal D-2 DA receptors, and these increases are attenuated by the coadministration of ICI 169,369. Likewise, pirenperone and clozapine, at doses which acutely produced elevations in DA metabolism which were similar to those produced by haloperidol, failed to increase the number of D-2 receptors in striatum. Interestingly, 5-HT2 receptor blockade did not appear to potently modulate the effects of D-2 receptor blockade in the olfactory tubercle, a brain region which is innervated by mesolimbic DA-containing neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Given orally 1, 5 or 24 hr before an i.v. histamine challenge, AHR-14310C produced ED50 values of 0.76, 0.22 and 0.58 mg/kg, respectively, in protecting naive guinea pigs from the lethal effects of the histamine challenge. AHR-14310C was also effective when the histamine was administered as an aerosol (1-, 5- and 24-hr ED50 values = 0.69, 0.38 and 1.08 mg/kg, respectively). AHR-14310C also attenuated the anaphylactic responses to aerosolized antigen in sensitive guinea pigs and the skin response to antigen in naturally sensitive dogs. AHR-14310C, at doses in vastly excess of those required to block histamine-induced hypotension, did not alter the electroencephalogram of cats, as did the sedating antihistamine, diphenhydramine. AHR-14310C did not affect the autonomic responses to acetylcholine, isoproterenol, epinephrine or 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium chloride in dogs. At low doses (0.316-1.0 mg/kg p.o.), AHR-14310C blocked antigen-induced tracheal mucous changes in sensitive rats.

  ".W": "In order to elucidate the tubular sites of action of loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide and ethacrynic-cysteine complex within isolated rat descending thin limbs, cellular ATP was measured by luciferin-luciferase technique. When short descending thin limbs of Henle's loop (SDL) were incubated in the absence of exogenous substrate at 37 degrees C, cellular ATP content was decreased in a time-dependent manner (up to 49% after 60 min). This ATP decrease, however, was retarded significantly in the presence of loop diuretics at 60 min. The mean percentage of change in ATP compared with the control for each loop diuretic in SDL was as follows: 10(-5) M furosemide, 178%; 10(-5) M bumetanide, 189%; and 10(-7) M ethacrynic-cysteine complex, 154%; respectively. To the contrary, cellular ATP in long descending thin limb of Henle's loop (LDL) was not changed by loop diuretics compared with the control. A similar protection against ATP depletion was observed in the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, in which the mean percentage was as follows: 10(-5) M furosemide, 163%; 10(-5) M bumetanide, 187%; and 10(-7) M ethacrynic-cysteine complex, 134%. Similarly to LDL, the cellular ATP did not change in outer medullary collecting tubule. From these results, we conclude that loop diuretics act on the isolated rat SDL, but not on LDL.\r"

Although the maximum binding value for D2 receptors was elevated in chronic HAL-treated rats, there was no sign of electrophysiological supersensitivity of CPu neurons to the selective DA D1 and D2 receptor agonists. CPu cells were subsensitive to LY-171555 in HAL-treated rats without a drug withdrawal period. This suggests that residual HAL in the rat brain actively blocked the D2 DA receptors. In contrast, in clozapine-treated rats with or without a drug withdrawal period, the sensitivity of CPu cells to either the D1 or D2 agonists was not altered. Coadministration of SKF-38393 and LY-171555 onto the CPu neurons primarily produced an additive effect and only two cells both from the HAL group showed a synergistic action. The majority of CPu cells failed to respond to iontophoretic application of CCK-8S in either the control or antipsychotic drug-treated rats. If these findings can be extended to humans, they do not support the view that tardive dyskinesia is the result of CPu DA receptor supersensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the thermodynamic properties of the binding of substrates and uptake blockers to the specific sites labeled with a tritiated dopamine uptake inhibitor (i.e., 1-[2-(diphenylmethoxy)ethyl]-4-(3-phenyl-2-propenyl)piperazine ([3H] GBR 12783) or [3H]mazindol) using striatal membrane preparations. Raising the incubation temperature from 0 degrees C to 25 degrees C or 37 degrees C resulted in an increase in the dissociation constant of both [3H]mazindol and [3H]GBR 12783 for their specific sites of binding present in membrane suspensions obtained from either rabbit or rat striatum. However, maximal concentrations of binding sites were not affected by temperature. At all tested temperatures, both substrates and carrier blockers competed with either [3H]mazindol or [3H]GBR 12783 in a monophasic fashion, with Hill coefficients close to unity. Raising the temperature induced little or no increase in inhibition constants (Ki) for substrates (Ki ratio 37/0 degrees C less than 2.5). This is consistent with the mild increase of the Michaelis constant of dopamine for the neuronal uptake system when the incubation temperature was raised from 12.5 to 37 degrees C (from 126 to 406 nM). In contrast, increasing the temperature resulted in a more important increase in the Ki of uptake inhibitors (33 greater than Ki ratio greater than 5). Thermodynamic calculations showed that the binding of substrates is generally characterized by a mild decrease in enthalpy (range, -2- -6 kcal/mol) associated with an increase in entropy, whereas binding of uptake inhibitors led to a decrease of both parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of ANG were compared with those of acetylcholine (ACh), an agonist that acts at muscarinic receptors in the intestinal smooth muscle and which does not induce desensitization. Both ANG and ACh stimulated 24Na+ influx upon addition to the cells, and this stimulation persisted for at least 30 min. Both agonists also stimulated 45Ca++ uptake but ANG's effect was transient, whereas that of ACh was persistent. Short-term (30 min) treatment with PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) caused a fade of the tonic response of the whole muscle to ANG, and also blocked this hormone's stimulating effect on 45Ca++, but not on 24Na+ influx. Long-term (7 hr) treatment with PMA, which suppresses protein kinase C activity, restored ANG's ability to stimulate 45Ca++ influx. The stimulating effects of ACh on 24Na+ and 45Ca++ influxes were not affected by short- or long-term treatment of the cells with PMA. Our results suggest that ANG desensitization involves protein kinase C inhibition of a step in the stimulus-response chain that is subsequent to phospholipase C-activation.\r"

These effects were studied both in chronic bumetanide-treated and in previous nontreated subjects. Li was given as Li carbonate p.o. Glomerular filtration was evaluated by creatinine clearance. Infusion of bumetanide increased fractional Na excretion and fractional Li excretion in the volume-replaced subject. Without volume-replacement bumetanide infusion increased these excretion rates to a significantly lower level. These results suggest that in humans acute submaximal doses of bumetanide cause inhibition of both proximal and distal tubular reabsorption of Na. Along with diuretic-induced volume contraction the natriuretic response is diminished perhaps due to a secondary increase in fractional Na reabsorption which occurs only in the proximal tubular portions of the nephron. In chronic bumetanide-pretreated subjects, however, the fractional Na and Li excretion increased significantly more than in the previous nontreated subjects. Compared to these ion excretions in diuretic-induced Na and volume-depleted subjects the results suggest that a secondary increase in fractional Na reabsorption is developed rapidly during submaximal bumetanide infusion in chronic bumetanide-treated subjects. In the distal part of the nephron, however, the bumetanide-induced increase in Na excretion is much less in the chronic bumetanide-treated subjects than in previous nontreated. Because of these results it is suggested that simple dose-effect relationship for loop-diuretics will be difficult to describe.\r"

The present study extended this work to mice selectively bred for sensitivity and resistance to ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex (LORR) and hypothermia. In all experiments LORR duration and ethanol concentrations at return of righting reflex were measured after i.p. hypnotic ethanol doses and exposure to 22 or 34 degrees C. In experiment 1, C57BL/6J, A/HeJ, 129/J, LS/lbg and SS/lbg mice were given 4.2 g/kg ethanol. In experiment 2, the same mouse genotypes were tested with different ethanol doses (2.5-4.9 g/kg) selected to produce an equivalent degree of impairment (60 min LORR duration). In experiment 3, HOT and COLD lines of mice were given 4.0 g/kg ethanol. In agreement with previous work, offsetting hypothermia reduced differences between genotypes in ethanol sensitivity. Comparisons within genotypes indicated that ethanol sensitivity in C57, A/He, SS, HOT and COLD mice increased as body temperature increased. In contrast, ethanol sensitivity in 129 and LS mice decreased as body temperature increased. These results extend previous findings indicating that body temperature during intoxication contributes to differences between genotypes in ethanol sensitivity. The present findings also suggest that there are qualitative differences in the effects of temperature on ethanol sensitivity within genotypes.\r"

Similar pA2 values (8.56 and 8.33, respectively) of ketanserin, tested against 5-HT and DOM, indicate that responses produced by both agonists are mediated by the 5-HT2 receptor. The contractions produced by 8-OH-DPAT and 2-methyl-5-HT were also blocked by ketanserin (10(-8) M) with the dissociation constants (KB) being 2.49 and 2.88 nM, respectively. This provides evidence that these agonists are activating 5-HT2 receptors in the ovine uterine artery. DOM was more potent than 5-HT, but had a similar efficacy to that of 5-HT. The greater affinity of DOM may explain its greater potency. The dissociation constants (KA) of 5-HT and DOM acting on 5-HT receptors were determined by analysis of concentration-response data before and after fractional inactivation of receptors with dibenamine. The mean KA values for 5-HT and DOM were 3.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(-7) and 1.8 +/- 0.3 x 10(-7) M, respectively. Assessment of receptor occupancy vs. functional response demonstrated little or no receptor reserve in this tissue. Several other 5-HT receptor agonists caused contractions but were much less potent than 5-HT.

  ".W": "We have studied the effects of histamine trifluoromethyl-toluidide derivatives on calcium mobilization in human peripheral blood lymphocytes using spectrofluorometric analysis. HTMT (compound 1) induced two phases of increase in intracellular calcium concentration--a rapid intracellular calcium concentration peak (10-60 sec), partial recovery (1-3 min) and a sustained moderate elevation that persisted for more than 5 min. The EC50 value was 1.9 X 10(-5) M. Pretreatment of lymphocytes with the agonist resulted in receptor desensitization that recovered after 15 min when the cells were drug free. The presence of extracellular ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid did not abrogate the early phase of the calcium rise, suggesting that the calcium appearing in the cytosol during the early phase was derived from intracellular stores. The increase in intracellular calcium concentration by this compound was competitively antagonized by high concentrations of histamine but not by classic histamine receptor antagonists (H1, H2 or H3). Other cyclic AMP elevating agents, with the exception of prostaglandin E2, did not affect the increase in calcium levels induced by compound 1. Compound 1 caused phosphatidylinositol metabolism resulting in inositol phosphate production, suggesting that inositol triphosphate may be the second messenger for the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by compound 1. The data imply a specific binding site for histamine trifluoromethyl toluidide derivative on lymphocytes that is different than the classic H1, H2 or H3 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The current study investigated the effects of acute and chronic administration of (+)-SKF 10,047 on body temperature in rats. The effect of phencyclidine on body temperature in chronically (+)-SKF 10,047-treated rats was also investigated. The acute administration of (+)-SKF 10,047 at doses of 5 to 40 mg/kg s.c. did not alter body temperature; however, 80 mg/kg produced hypothermia. In contrast, chronic administration of (+)-SKF 10,047 (5-20 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent hyperthermia when tested on day 7 and 10 of chronic treatment. Moreover, sensitization to the hyperthermic effects occurred as the degree of hyperthermia was greater on day 10 compared to day 7. Phencyclidine (20 mg/kg s.c.) produced hypothermia in rats chronically treated with saline for 13 days, but hyperthermia in rats chronically treated with 20 mg/kg of (+)-SKF 10,047 for the same duration. The hyperthermic effect of chronic (+)-SKF 10,047 treatment is similar to the previously reported dose-dependent hyperthermia in chronically phencyclidine-treated animals. The cross-sensitization of chronically (+)-SKF 10,047-treated rats to the hyperthermic effects of phencyclidine supports the hypothesis that there may be common mechanisms underlying the chronic effects of these drugs on body temperature.\r"

  ".W": "Solid grafts of fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue transplanted into a cavity overlying a dopamine (DA)-deafferented striatum are known to survive, send terminals into the host striatum and release DA. Using this preparation, we have examined receptor-mediated feedback modulation of DA metabolism in the graft and, separately, in its terminals in the host striatum. For this purpose we administered the DA receptor antagonist, haloperidol, and the DA receptor agonist, apomorphine (APO), systemically, and calculated the dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/DA and homovanillic acid/DA ratios as an index of DA turnover in the graft itself as well as in the adjacent host striatum. A marked increase in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/DA and homovanillic acid/DA ratios was seen after haloperidol treatment. This increase was found 1) within the solid transplant tissue itself as well as 2) within the transplant reinnervated regions of the host striatum. The net elevation in DA metabolites associated with the transplant terminals was less than that obtained in the intact striatum. APO significantly decreased the dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/DA and homovanillic acid/DA ratios in the transplant-innervated regions of the host striatum; this effect of APO was of a greater magnitude than that seen in intact controls. Within the solid transplant itself, APO caused slight but not significant decreases in DA metabolism. Our findings demonstrate that the transplanted DA neurons are subject to negative feedback regulation mediated via DA receptors and that transplant DA utilization is subject to both increases and decreases in response to drug-induced manipulations of DA receptors.\r"

The radioligands used for antagonist and agonist binding were [3H]idazoxan and [3H]p-aminoclonidine, respectively. Radioligand binding to membranes isolated from eight brain regions disclosed a small (14%) but statistically significant reduction in [3H]idazoxan binding in a single area, amygdala-pyriform-entorhinal cortex. This was confirmed by a larger (25%) reduction (P less than .02) in agonist binding in the same region. These reductions were present in animals sacrificed 1 day, but not 2 weeks, after the last kindled seizure. Quantitative radiohistochemical studies identified a bilaterally symmetric reduction of approximately 20% of [3H]p-aminoclonidine binding in the pyriform cortex and the central, medial and lateral amygdaloid nuclei. No significant differences were detected in nine other structures. We propose that the reduction in alpha-2 receptor binding contributes in part to the reduced sensitivity of pyriform cortex neurons of kindled animals to the inhibitory effects of alpha 2 agonists. The reduced alpha-2-receptor binding may also underlie a transient attenuation of alpha-2 receptor-mediated neuro-transmission and thereby constitute one mechanism contributing to kindling development.\r"

Oral administration of methotrexate (MTX) for the small intestinal mucosa of rats resulted in a severe histological change, whereas rats coadministered VA with MTX showed a histological status similar to that of control rats. The p.o. administration of MTX led to a decrease in the amounts of membrane proteins and lipids in rat small intestine and its brush border membrane. When administered p.o. with VA, this decrease failed to occur. The brush border membrane of MTX plus VA-treated rats, when monitored by the fluorescence of cationic safranin O and anionic 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, was found to resemble that from control rats rather than that from MTX-treated rats. The in vitro permeation of MTX in the small intestine of MTX plus VA-treated rats was enhanced, in contrast with the decrease noted for MTX-treated rats. However, that of untreated rats was not affected by the presence of VA. Thus, VA is unlikely to affect the transport process of MTX directly. When administered p.o. with VA, MTX was absorbed effectively to the same or a slightly greater extent than when administered by itself. Consequently, it has been shown histologically, biochemically, physicochemically and physiologically that VA protects the small intestine from the damage induced by MTX.\r"

  ".W": "The specificity of the hypoglycemic response to the intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the naturally occurring (-)-enantiomer of morphine previously reported from our laboratory was studied in mice. (+)-Morphine HBr (50 micrograms) caused a behavioral syndrome (scratching, biting, seizures) comparable to that produced by (-)-morphine sulfate (50 micrograms), but did not cause hypoglycemia. Many opioids, at a dose of 50 micrograms i.t. in nonfasted mice, showed either a saline-like hyperglycemic response or no significant effect on blood glucose. (+)-Morphine, ketocyclazocine, U-50,488, (-)- and (+)-N-allyl-normetazocine, beta-endorphin, (-)- and (+)-naloxone and naltrexone caused hyperglycemia. Significant changes from basal blood glucose were not produced by [D-Pen2, L-Pen5]-enkephalin, [D-Ser2]-Leu-enkephalin-Thr or sufentanil in 50-micrograms doses, or by codeine (300 micrograms), levorphanol (400 micrograms) or methadone (200-400 micrograms). Agonists which produced both hypoglycemic and behavioral effects were, in order of decreasing potency, hydromorphone greater than normorphine greater than morphine greater than 6-acetylmorphine greater than oxymorphone much greater than heroin. Morphine-induced hypoglycemia was partially antagonized by the i.t. coadministration of naloxone methobromide (10 micrograms). Fasting for 24 hr increased the sensitivity to hypoglycemic and lethal effects of morphine. D-Ala2-N-Me-Phe4-Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (5-50 micrograms i.t.) tended to decrease blood glucose in both nonfasted and fasted mice, but these effects were moderate and appeared to be unrelated to dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The specific binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol was used to quantitate the beta adrenoceptors. Chronic high-dose guanethidine, which decreased renal tissue and circulating catecholamines to the same extent as reserpine, failed to up-regulate renal beta adrenoceptors, which indicates that the effect of reserpine was not due to changes in the ambient catecholamine concentration. Isoproterenol-stimulated renin secretion, a measure of postsynaptic receptor function, was increased by reserpine but not denervation, which indicates that the failure to observe beta adrenoceptor up-regulation by radioligand binding studies after denervation was not an anomaly caused by loss of presynaptic receptors masking postsynaptic supersensitivity. Reserpine was effective even in denervated kidneys. Up-regulation of renal beta adrenoceptors with reserpine occurred even after destruction of peripheral sympathetic nervous system by a combination of adrenal demedullation and high-dose guanethidine administration. A lower daily dose of reserpine (0.3 mg/kg instead of 0.5 mg/kg), which caused no weight loss, was effective in producing beta adrenoceptor up-regulation. Antagonism of reserpine depletion of nerve terminal norepinephrine by tranylcypromine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, did not nullify renal beta adrenoceptor up-regulation. Overall, our results indicate that reserpine up-regulation of renal beta adrenergic receptors is independent of the sympathetic nervous system and possibly is a direct effect.\r"

  ".W": "The potency and efficacy of a series of muscarinic agonists for stimulation of neuronal firing rate was compared with stimulation of phosphoinositide (PPI) hydrolysis in similar hippocampal slice preparations. Carbachol, muscarine, pilocarpine, arecoline, bethanechol and oxotremorine varied in potency, but stimulated neuronal firing to a similar extent. At higher concentrations, all of the drugs except oxotremorine caused a decrease in firing rate (desensitization). A comparison of the concentration-response curves for PPI hydrolysis and neuronal firing rates showed that desensitization occurred at a threshold level of PPI hydrolysis. Although the concentration of drug that caused the decrease in firing rate was different for each agonist, the level of PPI hydrolysis at the desensitizing concentration was similar, with the exception of oxotremorine. Oxotremorine, the weakest agonist for stimulation of PPI hydrolysis, did not reach this PPI hydrolysis threshold and did not exhibit desensitization. Oxotremorine was also capable of both blocking and reversing the desensitization caused by carbachol. Low concentrations of pirenzepine, an M1 selective muscarinic antagonist, reversed carbachol desensitization. Concentrations of lithium that disrupt the phosphoinositide cycle by preventing recycling of free inositol (Allison, J. H., et al.: Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 71: 664-670, 1976; Hallcher, L. M. and Sherman, W. R.: J. Biol. Chem. 225: 10896-10901, 1980) slowly reversed desensitization. Furthermore, inositol added to the buffer could re-establish desensitization in lithium-treated preparations. These studies suggest that muscarinic desensitization of hippocampal cell firing is related to large increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Muscarinic receptor-stimulated increases in cell firing may be mediated by a subtype or state of muscarinic receptor different from that mediating phosphoinositide hydrolysis and desensitization.\r"

The results of this study demonstrate that dipyridamole has both prophylactic and curative effects on various experimentally induced gastric ulcers. It produced inhibition of normal and histamine-stimulated gastric secretion in rats. The intensity of gastric lesions induced by indomethacin and hypothermic restraint stress was reduced significantly by dipyridamole. Our findings also showed that dipyridamole protect gastric wall against hypothermic restraint stress-induced mucus depletion. It produced marked cytoprotective effect against all the necrotizing agents used in this study. The cytoprotective effect of dipyridamole against 80% ethanol was reversed significantly by prior treatment with a dose of indomethacin that inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis. These data indicate that dipyridamole inhibits the formation of gastric lesions by mucosal generation of prostaglandins. The concentration of nonprotein sulfhydryls were decreased significantly in gastric mucosa after administration of 80% ethanol. Treatment with dipyridamole replenish the reduced level of gastric mucosal nonprotein sulfhydryls, thus suggesting the mediation of its protective effect through sulfhydryls. Our findings show that dipyridamole possesses both antisecretory and antiulcer effects. Further studies are required to determine its role in the prophylaxis and or the treatment of gastric ulcer disease.\r"

Hearts with the right cardiac sympathetic nerve intact were isolated and perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution containing cocaine (10(-6) M) to block uptake 1, metanephrine (10(-6) M) to block uptake 2 and yohimbine (3 X 10(-6) M) to prevent alpha 2 receptor inhibition of Ca2+ influx. The nerve was stimulated with frequencies of 2, 6 and 12 Hz for 1 min and NE output was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrochemical methods.

The exclusive formation of GAM-5-glucuronide was unexpected, because GAM, when administered to the rat liver, formed predominantly monosulfate conjugates at the 5- and 2-positions (Morris et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 245: 614-624, 1988). Kinetic parameters obtained from single-pass studies for SAM sulfation (CIn increasing from 31 to 347 microM) and glucuronidation and hydroxylation (CIn decreasing from 1383 to 130 microM, with 0.85 mM SO4(2-), and CIn increasing from 32 to 800 microM in an absence of SO4(2-), with 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol, a sulfation inhibitor) revealed sulfation as a high-affinity, high-capacity pathway, glucuronidation as a lower-affinity, high-capacity pathway and hydroxylation as a low-affinity, low-capacity pathway. However, these parameters would not explain the exclusive glucuronidation of GAM when generated from SAM. Rather the zonal localization of metabolizing activities [a periportal sulfation, evenly distributed glucuronidation, and perivenous hydroxylation system (Xu and Pang, J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 17: 645-671, 1989; Morris et al., J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 16: 633-656, 1988)] could explain the complete lack of sulfation in SAM sequential metabolism. The different metabolite patterns arising from the administrations of a metabolite precursor (SAM) versus a preformed metabolite (GAM), due to the proximity of enzymes for formation and sequential metabolism, may serve to explain the differential toxic or pharmacologic effects observed in other precursor-metabolite pairs.\r"

In contrast, CsA had no effect on Na(+)-dependent L-alanine uptake in bILPM and in cLPM vesicles. In addition, electroneutral pH gradient-driven Na+ uptake in bILPM vesicles was unaffected by CsA treatment. CsA-induced inhibition of taurocholate transport in bILPM and cLPM vesicles was competitive in nature. A hydroxylated (OL-17) and a N-demethylated (OL-21) metabolite of CsA had no effect on taurocholate transport in either membrane vesicle population. These findings suggest that the mechanism of CsA-induced cholestasis is, in part, the result of selective inhibition of bile acid transport by the parent compound at both domains of the hepatocyte plasma membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Accumulation of inositol phosphates was determined in rat brain slices prelabeled with 2-[3H]inositol and incubated with various drugs. In the striatum, micromolar concentrations of dopamine, apomorphine and SKF38393 induced significant accumulations of inositol phosphates in a dose-dependent manner, whereas quinpirole lacked effect. The EC50 values for the accumulation of inositol monophosphate induced by dopamine, apomorphine and SKF38393 were, respectively, 148, 159 and 129 microM. SKF 38393 effect was time-dependent on the accumulation of all three inositol phosphates, with peak effects occurring 64-128 min after drug addition. The action of the dopamine D1 receptor agonist, SKF38393, was blocked by SCH23390 (D1-selective antagonist), but not by sulpiride (D2-selective antagonist), atropine (muscarinic antagonist), prazosin (alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist) or methiotepin and methysergide (serotonergic antagonists), indicating that the observed effects of dopaminergic agonists were selectively mediated through the D1 dopamine receptor. On examining the effect of SKF38393 in several brain regions, the highest dopaminergic stimulation of inositol phosphates formation was obtained in the amygdala, followed by the hippocampus and then the striatum and frontal cortex. The finding of an SKF38393-stimulated PI hydrolysis in amygdala, a brain region that is enriched in SCH23390 and SKF38393 binding sites but devoid of dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase, suggests that the D1 receptor that is linked to PI metabolism is independent of the D1 receptor which stimulates cyclic AMP formation.\r"

After incubation of vas deferens with 10(-2) M P-ATP for 5 min, the second phase of biphasic contractions to ATP was inhibited selectively. The inhibitory effect of P-ATP was specific for ATP, and resulted from affinity labeling in that it was long-lasting, was not reversed by washing, was related in magnitude to exposure period and was attenuated by ATP present during the incubation. In contrast to P-ATP, ANAPP3 inhibited selectively the first phase of ATP-induced responses. P-ATP and ANAPP3 together inhibited both phases of response. P-ATP inhibited selectively the second phase of responses to 5'-substituted ATP analogs which develop a prolonged second phase [e.g., adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and adenosine tetraphosphate] or an abbreviated second phase (e.g., beta,gamma-methylene ATP, beta,gamma-imido ATP and alpha,beta-methylene ATP). The greater the duration of the second phase, the more pronounced was the inhibitory effect. Two distinct and dissociable mechanisms mediate the biphasic response to ATP: the initial phase involves ANAPP3-sensitive P2x-purinoceptors, whereas the second is blocked by P-ATP and appears to involve cleavage of the phosphate chain. An additional effect observed as a result of P-ATP-treatment was potentiation of the first phase of contraction to ATP. This novel and irreversible effect may arise from the inhibition of degradative ecto-phosphohydrolase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Direct visualization of the entire length of the fallopian tube lumen, from the uterotubal ostium to the fimbria, using a transvaginal approach, has been achieved. Small, flexible hysteroscopes with outside diameters (ODs) ranging from 3.3 to 4.5 mm and operating channel diameters of 1.5 to 1.8 mm were used to pass guide wires, over-the-wire catheters and a falloposcope with an OD of 0.5 mm safely along the fallopian tube lumen. Forty-three falloscopy procedures were performed. The normal falloposcopic appearance of the fimbrial, ampullary, isthmic and intramural tubal epithelium was characterized in eight cases. In 35 falloposcopies, endotubal lesions were found and characterized. They included 5 cases of intramural stenosis; 10 of isthmic stenosis; 5 of isthmic obstruction; 2 of salpingitis isthmica nodosa; 10 of nonobstructive endotubal disease from intraluminal adhesions, associated devascularization and epithelial atrophy in the intramural, isthmic and ampullary segments; 2 of hydrosalpinx; and 1 of an intratubal polyp. A technique of guide wire cannulation and balloon tuboplasty under hysteroscopic-falloposcopic-laparoscopic control was developed for attempting to dilate a stenotic tube, open up an obstruction or break down intraluminal adhesions. A combination of 32 guide wire cannulation and direct balloon tuboplasty (DBT) procedures was performed. Guide wire cannulation and DBT were effective in breaking down non-obstructive intraluminal adhesions in 6/10 cases (60%), dilating intramural or isthmic stenoses in 6/15 cases (40%) and negotiating an isthmic stricture secondary to salpingitis isthmica nodosa in 1/2 cases (50%). Those procedures failed to bypass complete fibrotic obstructions in 5/5 cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We use the Nd:YAG laser for treatment of endometriosis; a total of 52 cases of minimal and mild endometriosis have been treated so far with the laser under laparoscopy in our clinic. At the same time we measured the peritoneal fluid volume and PG concentration in peritoneal fluid. Peritoneal fluid volume and PGE2 concentrations were found to be significantly higher than those in the control group (tubal obstruction patients). Seven of 52 patients received second-look laparoscopy three months after Nd:YAG laser treatment; the PG concentration showed a tendency to decrease in many patients, and the PGE2 concentration turned out to be insignificant. Within one year, 30 patients achieved pregnancy. In minimal and mild endometriosis patients Nd:YAG laser treatment may alter the PG concentration in peritoneal fluid, thereby increasing the change of pregnancy.\r"

The surgical approach to this problem, incorporating interruption of the superior hypogastric nerve plexus (presacral neurectomy), therefore, has become less popular. Investigations, however, have demonstrated that 20-25% of patients treated medically for this problem fail to show an improvement. As a result, attention has turned once again toward surgical treatment for those who have failed to respond to medical management. Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation, or laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation, appears to offer hope in this regard and represents a return to a surgical approach for conservative management of severe, disabling dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain in women who have failed medical treatment. Since there has been such an emphasis on outpatient treatment and surgery, a laparoscopic approach to the classic presacral neurectomy was devised and implemented.\r"

Tissue necrosis caused by high-frequency electrical energy is not immediately apparent: several days must elapse before the true extent of the damage can be seen. To study it, the uterus from a woman who was planning to undergo a hysterectomy was treated with the resectoscope four days prior to surgery. The depth of tissue destruction caused by 19 and 59 W of \"cutting\" current and by 28 and 57 W of \"coagulating\" current was 1.5, 2.7, 6.1 and 1.8 mm, respectively.

  ".W": "The chronically inflamed joint is usually chronically hypoxic and acidotic, and this is due partly to a high synovial metabolic rate, partly to reduced synovial capillary density and capillary \"burial\" under thickened synovium, and partly, in the end stages, to a chronically reduced blood flow. In addition, recent work indicates that prolonged flexion or strong muscular contraction around a chronically inflamed joint (knee) can exacerbate the biochemical abnormalities, by transiently raising intraarticular pressure to such high levels as to further impair synovial blood flow. The resulting unphysiological internal environment is presumably detrimental per se to the joint's well being, though precisely how requires more explicit investigation. The possibility that the subsequent reperfusion during joint relaxation is itself a damaging, radical generating process represents an additional exciting, albeit still contentious development.\r"

  ".W": "Investigations were carried out to determine the effect of ibuprofen and diclofenac on the chemotaxis of human polymorphonuclear cells. The experiments were done with the drugs alone as well as in the presence of leukotriene B4 (LTB4). A modified quantitative bioluminescence assay was used to measure chemotaxis, which allowed the calculation of differences in the spontaneous migration in contrast to the effects of the drugs, and simultaneously, also, the evaluation of whether the inhibition or augmentation of the chemotaxis was due to influences on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level of the cells. It was found that high concentrations (10 mM) of either ibuprofen or diclofenac destroy the intracellular ATP of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). Therefore, the reported inhibition of the chemotaxis by ibuprofen at a concentration of 10 mM cannot be understood as a part of the chemotactic process. In the range of 1 microM and 0.1 mM ibuprofen and diclofenac did not statistically affect the intracellular ATP level of PMN cells but at the same time a distinct inhibition of the chemotactic response of PMN cells was observed. This effect occurred even in the presence of a potent chemoattractant (leukotriene B4). Ibuprofen (0.1 mM) reduced chemotaxis to 67% and the same concentration of diclofenac reduced it to 56% of the values of LTB4 alone.\r"

We examined the relationship between the direction in which each of the disease measures changed between assessments and the direction of change in sequential sIL-2R levels. In 22 of the 25 (88%) instances where there was a 30% change in the active joint count between sequential assessments, the direction of change of the PB sIL-2R level was found to be in parallel (chi 2 = 11.7, p less than 0.008). Our results suggest that serial sIL-2R levels are a useful means of confirming clinically significant changes in disease activity in patients with RA, irrespective of therapy.\r"

In order to ascertain whether the DMARD-like properties of captopril reside in its ability to inhibit ACE or in the thiol group, we evaluated pentopril (CGS-13945) in patients with active RA. This recently synthesized drug is a nonthiol containing ACE inhibitor. Pentopril produced little clinical improvement and no biochemical improvement in a group of 15 patients with RA, many of whom were unable to tolerate it because of in-effect or side effects. A reduction in serum ACE activity and a modest fall in blood pressure suggested that the drug was exerting its pharmacological effect. Our study strengthens the argument that the therapeutic benefit of captopril in RA probably lies in its thiol group rather than in its enzyme inhibition properties, and that the thiol group may be the effective moiety in some other DMARD.\r"

These measures were particularly predictive of dying at worse levels of health status with a significant linear trend for mobility (p less than 0.05) and general health perception (p less than 0.01). Even after controlling for physical function, poorer levels of general health perception were significantly associated with mortality, (p less than 0.01 for linear trend).

Furthermore, our study compares the clinical, serologic and immunogenetic profile of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon versus those without Raynaud's phenomenon. It seems that Raynaud's phenomenon is a common manifestation (33%) in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome, precedes sicca manifestations in 42% of patients and follows a pleomorphic course; in some patients (14%) it disappears during the course of Sjogren's syndrome, in others (30%) the frequency of attacks decreases while in a 3rd group (56%) it remains the same. The local clinical sequelae of Raynaud's phenomenon in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome are swollen hands and evidence of small, soft tissue calcifications on radiographs. Digital pulp ulcers, sclerodactyly or periungal telengiectases are not seen. It seems however, that patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome and Raynaud's phenomenon develop glomerulonephritis, myositis and peripheral neuropathy more often than patients without Raynaud's phenomenon. These differences however, had no statistical significance. Finally, the autoantibody profile is similar in patients with and without Raynaud's phenomenon, while patients without Raynaud's phenomenon and primary Sjogren's syndrome showed a negative but not statistically significant association with the HLA-DR4 alloantigen.\r"

Using an ELISA with soluble peptidoglycan, we examined the sera of 110 patients with psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis without arthritis and a variety of other joint diseases. Antibody titers were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) among the 22 patients with psoriatic arthritis than the 16 patients with psoriasis without arthritis. Patients with other seronegative arthritides also had higher levels of antipeptidoglycan antibodies than patients with rheumatoid (seropositive) arthritis, osteoarthritis and crystal induced arthritis.

In chronic experiments, both CPPD injected and noninjected immobilized knees showed greater cartilage histopathologic-histochemical abnormalities (p less than 0.004) and significant reduction in cartilage hexosamine content (p less than 0.005), compared to exercised joints. CPPD injected knees, both exercised and immobilized, demonstrated an initial phase of increased cartilage biosynthetic activity (35S incorporation) at 20 days, compared to noninjected knees (p = 0.02), followed by a decline at 42 days (p less than 0.005). Our data indicate that joint movement enhances acute and chronic experimental CPPD crystal induced synovitis. Articular cartilage is more adversely affected by joint immobilization than by chronic crystalline inflammation. An optimum balance between exercise and rest seems necessary for patients with arthritis so that cartilage can be preserved but pain from active inflammation also controlled.\r"

The method is suitable for ordinary laboratory purposes and for very large-scale applications, such as the National Cancer Institute's disease-oriented in vitro anticancer-drug discovery screen, which requires the use of several million culture wells per year. Cultures fixed with trichloroacetic acid were stained for 30 minutes with 0.4% (wt/vol) sulforhodamine B (SRB) dissolved in 1% acetic acid. Unbound dye was removed by four washes with 1% acetic acid, and protein-bound dye was extracted with 10 mM unbuffered Tris base [tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane] for determination of optical density in a computer-interfaced, 96-well microtiter plate reader. The SRB assay results were linear with the number of cells and with values for cellular protein measured by both the Lowry and Bradford assays at densities ranging from sparse subconfluence to multilayered supraconfluence. The signal-to-noise ratio at 564 nm was approximately 1.5 with 1,000 cells per well. The sensitivity of the SRB assay compared favorably with sensitivities of several fluorescence assays and was superior to those of both the Lowry and Bradford assays and to those of 20 other visible dyes. The SRB assay provides a colorimetric end point that is nondestructive, indefinitely stable, and visible to the naked eye. It provides a sensitive measure of drug-induced cytotoxicity, is useful in quantitating clonogenicity, and is well suited to high-volume, automated drug screening. SRB fluoresces strongly with laser excitation at 488 nm and can be measured quantitatively at the single-cell level by static fluorescence cytometry.\r"

  ".W": "The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is implementing a large-scale in vitro drug-screening program that requires a very efficient automated assay of drug effects on tumor cell viability or growth. Many laboratories worldwide have adopted a microculture assay based on metabolic reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). However, because of certain technical advantages to use of the protein-binding dye sulforhodamine B (SRB) in a large-scale screening application, a detailed comparison of data generated by each type of assay was undertaken. The MTT and SRB assays were each used to test 197 compounds, on simultaneous days, against up to 38 human tumor cell lines representing seven major tumor categories. On subsequent days, 38 compounds were retested with the SRB assay and 25 compounds were retested with the MTT assay. For each of these three comparisons, we tabulated the differences between the two assays in the ratios of test group values to control values (T/C) for cell survival; calculated correlation coefficients for various T/C ratios; and estimated the bivariate distribution of the values for IC50 (concentration of drug resulting in T/C values of 50%, or 50% growth inhibition) for the two assays. The results indicate that under the experimental conditions used and within the limits of the data analyses, the assays perform similarly. Because the SRB assay has practical advantages for large-scale screening, however, it has been adopted for routine use in the NCI in vitro antitumor screen.\r"

Each treatment group consisted of 70 rats of each sex. A 30% decrement in weight gain occurred at an NaF dose of 25 mg/kg per day. Evidence of fluoride toxicity was seen in the teeth, bones, and stomach, and the incidence and severity of these changes were related to the dose of NaF and the duration of exposure. Despite clear evidence of toxicity, NaF did not alter the incidence of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions at any site in rats of either sex. Results from this study indicate that NaF is not carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the expression levels of the mdr1 and mdr3 multidrug-resistance genes (also known as PGY1 and PGY3, respectively) in peripheral blood cells from 69 adult patients with acute and chronic leukemias, using an RNase protection assay. Expression of mdr1 was found in samples from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (13 of 17), chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML, chronic phase, 10 of 10; blast crisis, three of four), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, eight of 11), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL, 17 of 17), hairy cell leukemia (HCL, one of two), and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (one of one), but not in B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL, 0 of seven). Expression of mdr3 was only detected in samples from B-cell lymphocytic leukemias: CML, lymphoid blast crisis (one of one), B-cell ALL (two of two), B-CLL (17 of 17), B-PLL (seven of seven), and HCL (two of two). In vitro drug uptake studies by on-line flow cytometry showed that in leukemia cells expressing either mdr1 or mdr3, the steady-state accumulation of daunorubicin could be significantly increased by addition of cyclosporine and, to a lesser extent, by verapamil. Because cyclosporine and verapamil are known as inhibitors of the mdr1-encoded P-glycoprotein drug-efflux pump, and because the mdr1 and mdr3 genes are highly homologous, our data suggest that the mdr3 gene encodes a functional drug pump in B-cell lymphocytic leukemias. The results of this study may have implications for clinical therapy for acute or chronic leukemias expressing the mdr1 or mdr3 gene, in particular, treatment with combinations of cytotoxic drugs plus agents that reverse multidrug resistance. Since mdr1 and mdr3 are frequently expressed in untreated as well as treated leukemia, such combination therapy should be considered for untreated patients as well as treated patients.\r"

Specific anti-recombinant murine TNF alpha antibodies markedly inhibited macrophage-mediated tumor cytolysis of A9 fibrosarcoma target cells following activation by MQ-1 membranes. Thus, TNF alpha plays a major role in mediation of tumor cytolysis induced by MQ-1 membranes, which is similar to its role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor cytolysis. Two findings, however, suggested that the mechanism of macrophage activation by MQ-1 membranes differs from that by LPS: (a) macrophages, taken from C3H/HeJ mice showing a low responsiveness to LPS, were activated by MQ-1 membranes to enhanced TNF alpha secretion, resulting in a high-level tumor cytolysis compared with the negligible tumor cytolysis induced by LPS; and (b) MQ-1 membranes and LPS synergized to highly augment TNF alpha secretion by macrophages of C57BL/6 mice. MQ-1 membranes were capable of inducing blast transformation of murine lymphocytes as well. In addition, they activated human monocytes to secrete high levels of TNF alpha. Further studies need to be carried out using in vivo models to evaluate the therapeutic potential of MQ-1 membranes in the treatment of malignant diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Of 534 human primary breast cancers provided for clonogenic assay in vitro, 276 (51.7%) developed distinctive colony formation by the soft-agar method. Estrogen receptors (ERs) were assayed by dextran-coated charcoal methods. A total of 65 (23.7%) of 274 breast cancers responded to added 10 nM 17 beta-estradiol (E2) by an increase in the number of colonies per dish of 150% or more of that in the controls treated with dextran-coated charcoal. The ER-positive and ER-negative tumors differed significantly in their response to E2: 55 (29.9%) of 184 ER-positive tumors responded versus 10 (11.1%) of 90 ER-negative tumors. The cancers in which the number of colonies increased to 150% or more of that of the controls were considered to be estrogen dependent; those in which the number of colonies increased to less than 150% of the control values were considered to be estrogen independent. When 1 microM tamoxifen (TMX) was added to the medium, 48 (21.3%) of 225 cancers showed a decreased in the number of colonies to 50% or less of that of the controls. Thus, we could separate breast cancers that were TMX sensitive (No. of colonies less than or equal to 50% of that of controls) from those that were TMX resistant (No. of colonies greater than 50% of that of controls). The response to TMX of the ER-positive cancers was significantly higher than that of the ER-negative tumors: 39 (25.5%) of 153 ER-positive tumors responded versus nine (12.5%) of 72 ER-negative tumors. In 153 ER-positive and 71 ER-negative tumors, we evaluated the correlation between the response to E2 and the response to TMX. ER-positive and ER-negative tumors differed significantly in their sensitivities to the two drugs. The TMX sensitivity did not completely correlate with the E2 dependence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each patient was evaluated with 131iodine-orthoiodohippurate renal scans performed within 24 hours before and after treatment. Changes in total effective renal plasma flow, effective renal plasma flow of the treated kidney and differential renal function were compared by paired t testing. No significant changes were associated with lithotripsy. On the basis of the renal scans we conclude that piezoelectric lithotripsy causes no significant changes in renal function, even in the early post-treatment period based on renal scan studies.\r"

Two patients had detrusor hyperreflexia, of whom 1 also had an incompetent sphincter. Erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction was reported by 3 men. We conclude that prolonged bladder and sexual dysfunction, caused by spinal cord inflammatory insult, may persist despite a systemic neurological recovery. Therefore, bladder management guided by initial and followup urodynamics is recommended.\r"

Preoperative coexisting urgency symptoms had no impact on the surgical outcome, resolving in the majority of patients with sensory urgency and responding to alternate postoperative management in those with bladder instability.

Our experience with 7 symptomatic single system ureteroceles in 5 children managed by low transverse endoscopic ureterocele incision is reviewed. After endoscopic incision, hydroureteronephrosis decreased in all patients. Vesicoureteral reflux after incision was noted in only 1 kidney. The technique of short (2 to 3 mm.) low transverse ureterocele incision is recommended for the initial management of single system ureteroceles to relieve obstruction. Preservation of the flap valve ureteral antireflux mechanism is possible in most children. The technique is simply performed, can be safely done in the youngest child and, in many, obviates the need for a further operation.\r"

Findings included normal urodynamic evaluations in 3 patients, 2 had high voiding pressures secondary to outlet resistance and 1 had incontinence on the basis of external urethral sphincter damage. In the remainder 3 patterns of bladder dysfunction were identified. Myogenic failure with overflow incontinence occurred in 14 patients. In this group clean intermittent catheterization or Valsalva's voiding was used for emptying. Hyperreflexic bladders were seen in 10 patients. Pharmacological suppression of instability was effective in 5 of 7 patients treated; 1 required bladder augmentation. Eleven children had a small capacity bladder and poor compliance. Post-void residuals were low and these bladders were generally but not always stable. Pharmacological bladder relaxation was successful in 3 patients, 3 underwent augmentation, 1 did well with alpha-agonists and followup is unavailable on the other 4. These 3 patterns of bladder dysfunction represent an overlapping constellation of residual urodynamic abnormalities due to previous bladder outlet obstruction. Individual patients may show facets of several types of dysfunction associated with 1 predominant pattern.\r"

Both are synthesized by various intrarenal cell types or by macrophages which may infiltrate the kidney during unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In several experimental systems, PAF receptor activation is accompanied by TxA2 release; pharmacological modification of TxA2 synthesis or receptor activation modulates the response to PAF. The involvement of PAF in UUO has not been studied previously, and the role of TxA2 has not been clearly defined by previous investigations. The hemodynamic response to acute UUO is characterized by decreases in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate and an acute increase in ureteral pressure. In the present experiments, the involvement of either PAF or TxA2 in the acute response to UUO was studied by determining if blockade of either the TxA2 or PAF receptor would affect the renal hemodynamic response to UUO. In addition, the effect of blockade of the TxA2 receptor on the renal response to PAF was determined. Our results indicate that only a small portion of the renal response to PAF is mediated by TxA2, and that neither PAF nor TxA2 can be implicated in the acute hemodynamic response to UUO. TxA2 or PAF involvement in the chronic response to UUO still remains to be determined.\r"

Preparations were mounted in organ baths and isometric tension was recorded. Spontaneous contractile activity was effectively abolished by the KCOs tested, cromakalim being the most potent of them. The KCOs concentration-dependently and effectively depressed electrically induced contractions and also contractions induced by exogenously applied noradrenaline and by low (less than or equal to 20 mM) concentrations of K+. Cromakalim was three to four times more potent than pinacidil. Pinacidil and cromakalim were shown to cause increases in the efflux of 86Rb from preloaded cavernous tissue. Papaverine also effectively depressed spontaneous contractile activity, and contractions evoked by electrical stimulation and noradrenaline. It had a potency 19 to 36 times lower than that of cromakalim. However, papaverine did not increase 86Rb efflux from preloaded tissue. The results show that cromakalim and pinacidil effectively relax penile erectile tissue, probably by the opening of K(+)-channels and subsequent hyperpolarization. Further investigations on human material seems motivated in order to elucidate if the principle of K(+)-channel opening offers any therapeutic advantages to other drugs in the diagnosis and treatment of penile erectile dysfunction.\r"

They were assessed by measuring 1) clonogenic cell survival 24 hours after treatment, 2) tumor growth delay, and 3) the number of lung metastases. The survival of clonogenic cells was reduced 38% by exposure to 2000 SW and tumor growth was delayed by 1.5 days. The limb bearing the tumor was excised in all animals when the tumor reached seven cm.3 The subsequent occurrence of lung metastases in three out of 13 unshocked animals and two out of 14 shocked animals indicated that SW did not promote the dissemination of tumor cells. At doses of one to four mg. CDDP/kg. body weight, SW exposure increased the effectiveness of the chemotherapy measured by a clonogenic assay. The fractional survival was 0.62 after 2000 SW alone, 0.23 with four mg. cisplatin/kg. alone and 0.10 after the combination treatment. At higher doses of CDDP, there was no added effect of SW over that of CDDP therapy alone. Tumor growth to one cm.3 was delayed by seven days after treatment with four mg. CDDP/kg., in comparison to untreated controls. SW exposure combined with CDDP treatment delayed the time taken for the tumor to reach one cm.3 by 13 days in comparison with untreated controls. However, the combination treatment increased animal mortality from 9% with CDDP alone to 29%. These results indicate that SW could be used focally to enhance the cell killing effects of CDDP.\r"

Normal fibroblast cells, FB-1 and FB8490, were used as control group. The cytoplasmic activity of lactic dehydrogenase, soft agar clonogenic assay, and in vivo tumor growth, survival rate and tumor taking rate with or without photoinactivation were monitored and compared between different cell lines. Efficacy of photoinactivation was time-related and more than 90 per cent of cytotoxicity could be obtained within 60 minutes of illumination. The plateau of cytotoxicity curve could be achieved after staining for 30 minutes by methylene blue under the same illumination time. Normal fibroblasts had the same features with cancer cells. Photoinactivation of tumor cells showed significant inhibition of tumor growth and tumor taking rate in experimental animals. Survival rate was also significantly prolonged in the animals with tumor cells receiving photoinactivation. These results suggest that methylene blue-sensitized photoinactivation may be useful as an adjuvant photochemotherapy for superficial bladder cancer.\r"

MGH-U1R is 40 times more resistant to doxorubicin than MGH-U1. In the present study, MGH-U1R was evaluated for its multi-drug resistance or pleiotropism by testing against other chemotherapeutic agents. MGH-U1R was found to be 188 times more resistant to vinblastine and 13 times more resistant to etoposide than MGH-U1, while remained sensitive to bleomycin. Taken together with earlier evidence that the resistance of MGH-U1R to doxorubicin can be reversed by a calcium-channel blocker verapamil, and the measured over-expression of the mdr1 gene in these cells, MGH-U1R has the characteristic multiple drug resistance properties similar to other established doxorubicin resistant carcinoma cell lines. MGH-U1R may be a useful model for the development of strategies in overcoming drug-resistance in the treatment of transitional cell carcinoma.\r"

However, post-procedural fever, sepsis and extrapelvic extravasation were observed more frequently in patients with complete than with partial staghorn calculi. Countermeasures to avoid complications must be developed in the future. However, we believe that fiberoptic transurethral nephrolithotripsy is a safe and effective treatment for staghorn calculi. This procedure also should be recommended, as well as the combination of percutaneous nephrolithotomy and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.\r"

  ".W": "In rabbits the contractile response of the urinary bladder is only partially due to cholinergic innervation since atropine does not completely block neuronally mediated contractions. In the human bladder this atropine resistance is controversial with some reporting atropine resistance in vitro while others have stated that the atropine resistance is also tetrodotoxin resistant. Results of the present investigation demonstrate that an atropine resistant, tetrodotoxin sensitive contraction can be evoked in some, but not all human bladder strips. Evidence accumulated over the past few decades indicates that this atropine resistant contraction may be mediated by ATP or a related purine compound. Studies presented herein are designed to develop a radioligand assay for this purinergic receptor. Initial studies indicated that the hydrolysis resistant ATP analog beta, gamma methylene ATP offers several advantages over ATP as a potential radioligand. It is only slowly hydrolyzed by endogenous ATPase and does not inhibit the hydrolysis of ATP indicating that it probably does not bind to the active sites of endogenous ATP hydrolyzing enzymes. In addition beta, gamma methylene ATP is 10-100 fold more potent than ATP itself in stimulating contractions of the urinary bladder in-vitro. The radioligand binding assay herein described can be used to quantitate the density of purinergic receptors, an essential step for determining the role of this system in urinary bladder function and dysfunction. Application of this assay could form the foundation for development of a new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of urinary bladder dysfunction based on modulation of the purinergic nervous system.\r"

Over-all quality of life was excellent in 13 patients who were able to return to work, participate in pre-illness levels of activity and enjoy sexual activity. While successful renal transplantation allows patients with end stage renal failure to resume relatively normal lives, these patients remain prone to complications resulting from long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

Eight patients (29%) had deoxyribonucleic acid diploid, 11 (39%) tetraploid and 9 (32%) aneuploid ploidy patterns. Ploidy pattern significantly correlated with histological grade and tumor stage. Almost all tumors were histologically of high grade; among the patients with high grade tumors ploidy analysis separated fair and poor prognosis groups. Pathological stage was the dominant clinical variable. A total of 14 patients (50%) had advanced stage disease and all died within 12 months of diagnosis. Nearly all of these patients showed abnormal ploidy patterns and ploidy analysis was not useful prognostically for this group. In contrast, all 3 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis who were long-term survivors had deoxyribonucleic acid diploid tumors. However, there is no clear statistical evidence from this study that ploidy analysis provides important prognostic information independent of stage and grade for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis.\r"

An additional contribution to continence comes from the seal produced by the inner softness of the mucosa.\r"

All groups experienced significant morbidity from the remaining in situ bladder. Over-all, 80% of the patients experienced at least 1 complication, chief among which were pyocystis (67%), hemorrhage (23%), severe pain (13%), and unremitting feelings of incomplete emptying and spasm (17%). Complications of sufficient severity to require rehospitalization occurred in 43% of the patients. Several patients required multiple rehospitalizations. Reoperation requiring general or regional anesthesia was necessary in 9 patients (30%) and included 4 cystectomies. Serious consideration should be given to performing primary cystectomy at the time of supravesical diversion in any patient in whom subsequent undiversion is not anticipated.\r"

Of the 16 patients 15 (94%) stopped leaking after a transvaginal repair. All 7 patients with high lying lesions who underwent operative repair less than 3 months after injury were dry. We advocate early nondelayed repair of high and low lying simple nonradiated vesicovaginal fistulas using the transvaginal approach. The customary waiting period of 3 to 6 months before repair may not be warranted.\r"

Substitution cystoplasty provides satisfactory results in most of these cases, while avoiding the need for urinary diversion. It has been suggested that interstitial cystitis may affect the bowel segment used in this form of operation. We studied bowel segments removed from cystoplasties in 5 patients with interstitial cystitis and compared these to bowel used for lower urinary reconstruction for other disorders in 6 patients. All segments showed varying degrees of inflammation, fibrosis and mastocytosis but there was no difference between the 2 groups for these features. We conclude that inflammation and fibrosis is the usual reaction of bowel to exposure to urine, and they do not represent a specific spread of interstitial cystitis in those patients. However, this reaction does mimic the histological appearance of interstitial cystitis in the bladder and may suggest a model for this disease.\r"

However, transient episodes of mild hematuria persisted in 1 patient during the 3-month followup despite a higher dose of conjugated estrogen (10 mg. per day). Complications, including thromboembolism and other side effects associated with conjugated estrogen, were not observed in these patients. We postulate that conjugated estrogen controls hematuria in hemorrhagic cystitis by decreasing the fragility of the mucosal microvasculature of the bladder.\r"

No statistically significant interracial differences emerged from the analysis. Grade 1 papillary tumors were the most numerous types encountered, consisting of 43% of the urothelial tumors in men of both races, and 37.5% in white and 31% in Japanese women. Recently, observed increasing incidence trends of urothelial tumors among white men in the United States are associated with a synchronous decrease in mortality trends. Our analysis indicates that these diverging trends cannot be accounted for by increased numbers of noninvasive papillary tumors.\r"

This protein appears to be a glycoprotein because it binds to concanavalin A-conjugated sepharose and can be eluted by alpha-methyl D-mannoside. It does not react immunochemically with antibodies prepared against either carcinoembryonic antigen or epidermal growth factor receptor, both of which have an apparent molecular weight close to 180 kDa. We found this protein in the urine of 74.3% of the patients with transitional cell carcinoma. It was not present in age-matched controls, patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or patients with 10 other cancers. There was 1 false positive result in a patient with prostate cancer. It does not appear to be associated with urinary tract infection, blood contamination, premedication or anesthesia.\r"

To characterize further the local cellular response in the bladder wall of patients receiving intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin bladder biopsies were examined before and immediately after a 6-week course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin and for up to 1 year at 3-month intervals thereafter. The results showed a marked infiltration after bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy predominantly of the suburothelial tissue with mononuclear cells, which expressed activation markers and accumulated to follicle-like granulomatous structures. With regard to T lymphocyte subsets the ratio of T helper-to-T suppressor cells in the bladder wall increased from 0.5 to nearly 2. This phenomenon persisted even in biopsies 1 year after initial treatment. In some probes activated mononuclear cells invaded the urothelium, emanating from suburothelial granulomas. It is tempting to assume that these changes within the local immunocompetent cells are related to the therapeutic effect of bacillus Calmette-Guerin against bladder cancer.\r"

We reviewed the records of 200 men who underwent radical cystectomy between 1969 and 1976. In 76 men urethrectomy and cystectomy were combined. Of these patients 6 had known urethral tumors and the incidence of unsuspected urethral malignancy was 2.9%. A total of 124 men had initial cystectomy only and were monitored up to 16 years (mean 67 months). Of these patients 6 (4.8%) underwent subsequent urethrectomy for malignant disease 6 to 40 months (median 23.5 months) after cystoprostatectomy. This group included 1 of 69 patients (1.5%) who presented with a solitary tumor not encroaching on the bladder neck, 1 of 22 (4.5%) with either carcinoma in situ or multifocal tumors not involving the prostate and none of the 9 with tumor at the bladder neck alone, which suggests that these patients may be satisfactory candidates for continent urinary diversion and may avoid the added risk to potency associated with urethrectomy. However, urethral recurrences were found in 4 of 24 patients (17%) who presented with disease extending into the prostate, including 3 of 10 (30%) with stromal invasion. These results emphasize the importance of assessing the prostatic urethra and ducts carefully before deciding to eliminate urethrectomy.\r"

A group of 64 patients who suffered a prostatomembranous urethral disruption in association with a pelvic fracture and who were managed initially by suprapubic cystostomy with delayed urethroplasty was compared to 17 patients managed initially by primary realignment. No statistically significant difference in the incidence of impotence or urinary incontinence was found between the 2 groups (p greater than 0.5) Secondary reconstructions for impassable strictures developed in 95% of the patients treated by a suprapubic tube alone compared to 53% of those treated by primary realignment. Indeed, only 1 patient in the latter group achieved urethral continuity that did not require further intervention. We conclude that while primary realignment is associated with no increase in the instance of impotence and urinary incontinence, it subjects the patient to a major operation at a critical time and provides little in the way of long-term positive gains for the effort expended. In the final analysis the outcome is more dependent upon the nature of the injury and the quality of the repair than upon the order in which the repair is effected.\r"

We applied endoscopically a specially designed high pressure, large diameter balloon catheter to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or primary bladder neck hyperplasia who presented with symptomatic, cystoscopic and urodynamic evidence of obstruction. We report our preliminary experience with 42 patients: 28 with benign prostatic hyperplasia and 14 with bladder neck hyperplasia. Six months after dilation 46% of the patients demonstrated at least a 25% improvement in subjective (symptom score) and objective (corrected peak flow rate) parameters, while 6 (21%) experienced excellent (greater than 50%) symptomatic improvement despite unchanged corrected peak flow rates and 3 (11%) showed significant (greater than 50%) improvement in corrected flow rate alone. At 1, 3, 6 and 12 months the symptom scores decreased by 70, 67, 61 and 59% (median) from pre-treatment levels. Men with benign prostatic hyperplasia fared better than those with primary bladder neck hyperplasia (74 versus 58% decrease at 6 months). Objective evaluation by corrected peak flow rates demonstrated 25, 24, 28 and 2% median improvement at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. Patients with primary bladder neck hyperplasia had substantially greater increases than those with benign prostatic hyperplasia (47 versus 27% at 6 months). Immediately after dilation the serum prostate specific antigen level increased by at least 1.5 ng. per ml. in 16 of 22 patients, indicating significant tissue trauma. Complications included mild bleeding and pain for the initial 24 hours and transient urinary retention in 2 patients. Our experience demonstrates the safety of an endoscopic approach to balloon dilation of the prostate that allows the urologist to maintain a central role in the assessment of a new approach to the treatment of obstructed voiding dysfunction.\r"

Of the 199 patients 92 (46%) had positive resection margins; there was no difference in the frequency between the nerve-sparing and standard procedures. The 1987 slide review showed a positive resection margin frequency of 58%. The presence and extent of positive resection margins were directly related to tumor size. The positive resection margin frequency also increased with poorly differentiated carcinoma, capsular penetration and seminal vesicle involvement. Determination of these risk factors identifies patients at greatest risk for positive resection margins.\r"

  ".W": "We extended the study of oxalate bioavailability by testing 7 additional food items: brewed tea, tea with milk, turnip greens, okra, peanuts and almonds. Nine normal subjects ingested a large serving of each of these items. The bioavailable oxalate was calculated from the increment in urinary oxalate during 8 hours after ingestion and bioavailability was determined as the percentage of total oxalate content in a given food item represented by bioavailable oxalate. Brewed tea and tea with milk, with a high oxalate content, had a low bioavailable oxalate level (1.17 and 0.44 mg. per load) because of the low oxalate availability (bioavailability of 0.08 and 0.03%). Turnip greens, with a satisfactory oxalate bioavailability (5.8%), had a negligible effect on urinary oxalate excretion, since oxalate content was relatively low (12 mg. per load). Okra, with a moderate oxalate content (264 mg. per load) had a negligible bioavailable oxalate (0.28 mg. per load). Only peanuts and almonds provided a moderate increase in oxalate excretion (3 to 5 mg. per load) due to the modest oxalate content (116 and 131 mg. per load) and oxalate bioavailability (3.8 and 2.8%). Thus, the ability of various oxalate-rich foods to augment urinary oxalate excretion depends not only on oxalate content but on the bioavailability.\r"

  ".W": "After 1 year of allopurinol treatment in 36 patients with a history of uric acid and/or calcium oxalate lithiasis and hyperuricosuria, we observed that in addition to the desired decreases in uric acid there were apparently significant decreases in urinary oxalate levels: 37 +/- 3 mg. per day (mean +/- standard error) before therapy and 31 +/- 4 mg. per day after a mean decrease of 16% (p less than 0.05) with an equivalent decrease in the supersaturation (calcium oxalate) of the urine. However, the decrease in oxalate could have been related to changes in dietary habits rather than to any specific effects of allopurinol on oxalate metabolism. Therefore, we recruited 26 of the patients for a study in which dietary factors were controlled. Each participant was assigned to 1 of 3 diet groups: low or high protein, or a customary diet. Each patient collected a urine specimen while on allopurinol and again after the medication was discontinued. With analytical procedures that we ascertained to be free of any significant methodological bias, we observed no significant changes in urinary oxalate excretion that could be attributed to allopurinol. There were significant differences in oxalate excretion on versus off allopurinol between the low and high protein groups, with higher oxalate levels found for the latter group. Our results indicate that allopurinol does not have a specific effect on oxalate metabolism or oxaluria.\r"

We have reviewed our recent experience with 96 patients, 94% of whom had diabetes and had 97 bypasses placed to the dorsal pedal artery. All procedures were for limb salvage. Superimposed infection was present in 42.3%. In 92 instances where intraarterial digital subtraction angiography successfully visualized the dorsal pedal artery, 91 bypasses were placed. In 12 other cases where the dorsal pedal artery was not visualized by intraarterial digital subtraction angiography but audible with the continuous-wave Doppler, bypasses were completed successfully in six. All procedures were performed with vein. Inflow was taken from the femoral artery in 48, popliteal artery in 45, tibial artery in 2, and from a femoral tibial graft in 2. Perioperative mortality was 1.92%. Actuarial graft patency, limb salvage, and patient survival were 82%, 87%, and 80%, respectively at 18 months. We conclude that bypass grafting to the dorsal pedal artery can be reliably performed with acceptable short-term results. An attempt should always be made to visualize the foot vessels angiographically, especially in diabetic patients, so that this valuable option in arterial reconstruction will not be overlooked.\r"

Subsequent angiography and duplex scanning with the arm elevated in the pitching position demonstrated inducible compression of the axillary artery by the humeral head as well as compression at the thoracic outlet. To determine the incidence of axillary and subclavian artery compression and to investigate the mechanism of injury, brachial artery blood pressures and duplex scans of the subclavian and axillary arteries were performed in both the neutral position and the throwing position in the 92 extremities of 19 major league baseball pitchers, 16 non-pitching major league players, and 11 nonathlete controls. A drop in blood pressure of greater than 20 mm Hg was noted in the position in 56% of extremities tested, with a loss of a detectable blood pressure in 13%. Compression of the axillary artery by the humeral head was documented in 83% of extremities, but in only 7.6% was a greater than 50% stenosis inducible. No statistical difference was found in the incidence of arterial compression between the three groups tested or between their dominant and nondominant extremities. Dissection of the axillary artery in two cadavers documented that abduction and external rotation of the arm causes compression of the axillary artery by the humeral head, which acts as a fulcrum. We conclude that the repetitive mechanical trauma of the throwing motion can cause intermittent compression and contusion of the axillary artery by the humeral head and predisposes the athlete who throws to thrombosis of the axillary artery.\r"

Angiographic data are available for 598 of 670 (89.3%) patients in our carotid registry. In 63 (10.5%) patients the internal or common carotid artery on the side opposite the endarterectomy was occluded.

  ".W": "Pain or tenderness of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is widely believed to signify acute expansion and imminent rupture. To assess the potential benefit of emergency operation for the group of patients with an acutely expanding aneurysm, the clinical course of 19 patients with a symptomatic but unruptured expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm was compared with 117 patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm resection, and 69 patients having operation for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Postoperative morbidity was high in the patients with an expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm, and included a 21% incidence of myocardial infarction, a 10% incidence of stroke, a 37% risk of ventilatory failure, and a 31% incidence of acute renal failure, which was not statistically different from the results in patients having ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm resection. Patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm resection had only an 8% risk of myocardial infarction, and only a 2% risk of stroke, ventilatory failure, or renal failure. The mortality rate for expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm resection was 26% compared to 35% for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (p = 0.31). Both emergency operations had a mortality rate more than five times greater than the 5.1% after elective procedures (p = 0.008). Our findings emphasize the need for early and aggressive treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm in the elective setting, even in the patient at high risk, and suggest that the preoperative assessment and modification of risk factors is important to prevent the cardiac, cerebrovascular, pulmonary, and renal complications seen accompanying an emergency operation of this magnitude.\r"

This experiment compared platelet deposition on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts after balloon catheter thrombectomy with deposition on new, nonthrombosed grafts. Three models of graft thrombosis were studied in eight dogs with 4 mm diameter by 7 cm PTFE graft segments: (1) in vitro model: grafts filled with blood, stored in 37 degrees C saline solution; (2) in vivo model: blood-filled grafts stored in subcutaneous tissue; and (3) in situ model: one end of grafts anastomosed to femoral or carotid artery as a blind tube. Duration of thrombosis (1, 2, and 3 weeks) was studied by initiating one graft of each type per week in each dog. After 3 weeks, nine thrombosed grafts per dog were harvested and graft thrombectomy was performed with a 3F balloon catheter. An ex vivo flow-controlled perfusion circuit was then created in each dog and platelet deposition was measured during the initial 20 minutes of graft perfusion after 111In platelet labeling. Thrombectomized grafts were compared with new, control grafts not previously exposed to blood, as well as with grafts exposed for 1 hour to blood or plasma. Compared with control grafts, platelet deposition was significantly increased on in vivo (3.7 times control; p less than 0.01), in situ (2.6 times control; p less than 0.05), and in vitro thrombosed grafts (2.0 times control; p less than 0.05). Age of thrombus was not a significant source of variation. Blood or plasma exposure alone did not significantly increase platelet deposition. These data suggest that antiplatelet therapy may be important at the time of PTFE graft thrombectomy.\r"

When symptoms do occur they are usually causally related to aneurysmal or occlusive sequelae of atherosclerotic disease of the anomalous vessel. More unusual manifestations peculiar to the anomalous artery include aneurysmal degeneration of the origin of the vessel from the aortic arch, with its inherent risk of rupture, or symptoms of compression of the trachea or more commonly the esophagus by the anomalous vessel as it traverses the superior mediastinum. In patients with symptoms a variety of operative approaches and management strategies have been used. Our recent experience with treatment of two patients with clinical symptoms caused by an aberrant right subclavian artery illustrate the varied surgical options and prompted a review of the surgical management of this unusual anomaly.\r"

Sixteen abnormal test results were obtained in 15 patients (9.5%) as follows: deficiencies of antithrombin III (2), protein C (4), and protein S (1) and presence of lupus-like anticoagulant activity (5) and heparin-induced platelet activation (4). Reconstructive surgery was performed in 137 of the study patients. Five reconstructions, all infrainguinal bypass grafts, suffered thrombosis within 30 days. Early graft thrombosis occurred in three (27%) of 14 patients with abnormal preoperative test results compared to two (1.6%) of 123 patients with normal testing (p less than 0.01). Of the three patients with abnormal test results and graft thrombosis, lupus-like anticoagulant was detected in two and heparin-induced platelet activation in one. This preliminary study supports routine preoperative screening for lupus-like anticoagulant and heparin-induced platelet activation in patients undergoing infrainguinal reconstruction. Hypercoagulable states appear to be sufficiently common and important in the general vascular surgical population to warrant further investigation.\r"

However, we have noted in this patient population with extensive atherosclerosis that inflow disease can cause axillofemoral graft failure despite normal preoperative clinical and noninvasive parameters. We prospectively determined the incidence of unsuspected inflow stenosis with arteriography in 40 consecutive candidates for primary (28) or secondary (12) axillofemoral bypass surgery. A new arteriographic technique with a single translumbar puncture was developed to safely and clearly visualize the potential inflow and outflow tracts. Ten of the 40 patients (25%) exhibited inflow stenosis greater than 50% of luminal diameter (unilateral in eight patients and bilateral in two patients). Seven were on the left side (five subclavian, two axillary) and five were on the right side (three subclavian, one axillary, one innominate). In eight of the 40 patients (20%) the stenotic inflow lesion was ipsilateral to the ischemic leg and therefore proximal to the preferred inflow site of an axillofemoral bypass. Upper extremity arterial pressure measurements suggested potential inflow artery stenosis in only three of the 12 (25%) instances. These findings show that equal arterial pressures in the upper extremities do not ensure adequate inflow for an axillofemoral graft. Routine arteriographic assessment of inflow intacts is recommended before axillofemoral bypass surgery.\r"

To determine the effect of porosity on graft healing, we measured the extent of cellular response at late times in 4 mm internal diameter polytetrafluoroethylene grafts of varying porosity (between 10 and 90 microns internodal distance) inserted into the arterial system of baboons. After 1 and 3 months the grafts were retrieved and examined for endothelial coverage, intimal thickening, and endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell proliferation. The pattern of intimal healing with endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells was only related to porosity in the sense that there was an abrupt switch in the pattern of healing as porosity was increased from 30 to 60 microns. In low porosity grafts (10 and 30 microns internodal distances) endothelial coverage of the luminal surface was incomplete and, along with intimal thickening, was limited to graft near the anastomosis. In high porosity grafts (60 and 90 microns internodal distances) luminal endothelial coverage was complete, and intimal thickening was uniformly distributed throughout the graft. The highest porosity graft studied (90 microns) developed areas of focal loss of endothelial cells at late time periods. In this limited series there does appear to be an optimal porosity for polytetrafluoroethylene grafts near 60 microns, since 10 and 30 micron grafts fail to achieve luminal endothelial cell coverage, and 90 micron grafts exhibit instability of the intima with focal endothelial cell loss.\r"

The data in this report address the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of alcohol-related problems experienced prior to medical school training.

Self-report questionnaires included: alcohol-related problems (the MAST), earlier parent-child relationships, personality characteristics (external locus of control, self-esteem, dependency, masculinity-femininity), life events, social supports, motivations for drinking and symptomatic distress. The male students manifested a higher mean level of alcohol problems, and the sexes differed at the trend level when the MAST was scored to distinguish \"problem\" from \"nonproblem\" drinkers (with 18.4% of the students reporting 5 or more problem points and 7.4% reporting 4 problem points). The significant correlates of alcohol problems included: perceived lack of earlier maternal affectivity (for men) and perceived lack of earlier paternal affectivity (for women), and lack of emotional support (for men). Moreover, escape motives for men were the motives most highly correlated with alcohol problems. Symptomatic distress (anxiety and hostility) was significantly correlated with alcohol-related problems in men but not women. Future reports will depict the psychosocial experiences and alcohol-related problems manifested by this cohort during medical training.\r"

In addition, measures of marital or relationship adjustment, ratings of social functioning and ratings of work functioning were administered to both the alcoholic and the spouse. Assessment was conducted at pretreatment, posttreatment, 6-month follow-up and 1-year follow-up. While the two treatment groups were not significantly different on any measures at the termination of therapy, the conjointly treated alcoholics had significantly lower alcohol consumption than the standard group at 6-month follow-up. There was also a trend for the couple treatment condition to be drinking less than the standard condition at 1-year follow-up. There was also a trend for the conjointly treated couples to report better Marital Adjustment Scale (MAS) scores than those in the standard treatment condition at 6-month follow-up.

However, previous studies have failed to employ appropriate designs and data analytic strategies to identify moderators and mediators. This article uses a large data set to illustrate such analyses. In the current data, both presumed personality risk and dispositional self-awareness were found to play moderator (rather than mediator) roles. The conceptual, methodological and data analytic implications of the mediator-moderator distinction are discussed.\r"

Patients were breath analyzed and interviewed regarding self-reported alcohol consumption 6 hours prior to the injury or illness event, usual drinking patterns and alcohol-related problems. Similar associations of alcohol consumption and casualties were found between the two populations with positive admission breath-analyzer readings and moderate consumption being positively associated with injuries. Both samples reported higher rates of heavy drinking, drunkenness and alcohol-related problems than that found in general surveys of their respective populations. Differences found between the two samples were largely due to varying drinking patterns in the two cultures and to differing uses of the emergency room for treatment.\r"

A total of 156 individuals attending a health fair at a southern university participated in an alcohol survey. Subjects were randomly distributed an alcohol survey that presented a 7-day and a 28-day quantity-frequency (Q-F) measure and a retrospective diary measure. Subjects were also randomly distributed an informed consent sheet that stated that their responses would remain completely anonymous and confidential or one that stated that their responses would be kept completely confidential and asked them to identify significant others to verify their responses. A significantly greater proportion (p = .0003) of subjects receiving instructions of confidentiality with verification did not sign the consent form or did not identify at least one significant other. No differences were found across types of instructions on measures of alcohol consumption and willingness to report alcohol, cigarette and marijuana use. The retrospective diary resulted in significantly greater reports of the number of drinking days per week (p = .0004) and number of drinks per week (p = .02) than did 7-day and 28-day Q-F measures. The diary measure also classified a greater percentage of drinkers as heavy drinkers, whereas the 28-day Q-F measure classified a greater percentage of subjects as drinkers.\r"

Subjects participated in three separate 30-minute ad lib drinking sessions and were presented with one of the three types of alcoholic beverage at each session. Data on total volume of beverage and of absolute ethanol consumed as well as blood alcohol concentration (BAC) attained were collected in each session. Subjects preferring wine or mixed drinks drank more alcohol and reached higher BACs when imbibing their beverage of choice than when drinking non-preferred beverages. Subjects preferring beer, however, showed no differences on these drinking measures as a function of beverage type. Men's reports of routine alcohol use had a high positive correlation with actual alcohol consumption observed in the laboratory, whereas for female subjects the correlation was near zero. Implications for interpretation of past ad lib drinking studies and the planning of future ones are discussed.\r"

In the present study, subjects were asked to rate the strength of their beliefs in addition to indicating whether or not they endorsed the items on a measure of alcohol-related expectancies. Three issues were addressed: (1) Do strength ratings and endorsements predict the perceived likelihood of drinking when their correlated effects are taken into consideration and do these responses interact? (2) Do the endorsements and strength ratings form higher order factors? and (3) Do men and women with various drinking habits rate the strength of their beliefs for a moderate and a large dose of alcohol in a way that mirrors their endorsements? The results suggest that the strength of an alcohol-related expectancy must be measured in its own right and cannot be inferred from the pattern of endorsements. Interactions of endorsements and strength ratings produce unique information that is not deducible from either measure alone.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigations with adolescents (aged 12-19) have shown alcohol-related expectancies to develop in childhood prior to significant drinking experience and to covary directly with drinking behavior. To chart the development of alcohol expectancies in children as young as age 6, a procedure was developed to be as independent as possible of age-related variation in reading and language development. This instrument was administered to 114 elementary school children of both genders, distributed across grades 1 to 5. Psychometric analysis provided evidence of the test's reliability and validity. Evaluation of the developmental pattern produced two primary findings: (1) there was an overall trend of increasingly positive expectancies with age; and (2) strikingly, the bulk of the increase was observed in the third and fourth grades. Children's expectancies may be less differentiated than adolescent or adult expectancies. These findings suggest that the precursors for later alcohol use and abuse are formed in childhood and that prevention efforts may need to begin as early as third grade.\r"

Increased utilization of alcoholism programs and self-reported sobriety at 10 weeks were assessed. MI consisted of three separate discussions of the relationship of the patient's disease to continued drinking and the compassionate offer of treatment. Two persons skilled in treatment also met with each MI subject and discussed treatment possibilities for them, facilitating entrance if desired. Patients in both the MI and control group were treated for their medical condition by a medical team and alcoholism treatment was always recommended. Outcome was evaluated for the period from the 10th to the 16th week after return to the community by interview of patient and household contacts and by the keeping of appointments. There were no differences between the control and MI groups, with at least 38% remaining sober for the 10-week interval; the study size was sufficient to detect reliably a 30% improvement. We conclude that additional motivational intervention to this level was not beneficial to the hospitalized alcoholic with disease. There was a statistically significant increase in sobriety among patients who either undertook alcoholism therapy, accepted all parts of the study or kept clinical appointments.\r"

A total of 380 consecutive admissions meeting DSM-III diagnostic criteria for alcohol use or dependence were studied. Of these subjects, 75% used both alcohol and drugs. The most frequently used drugs were marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines and tranquilizers. Overall, subjects who used drugs with alcohol had significantly lower MCV and GGTP values than subjects who used alcohol alone. More specifically, cocaine use was associated with lower MCV values, marijuana use with lower AST values and heroin use with higher AST and GGTP values. These differences between drug-using and non-drug-using alcoholics were significant even after controlling for variables that affect the laboratory values such as age, quantity, frequency and duration of alcohol consumption. These findings indicate that any study of laboratory markers of alcoholism needs to consider concomitant illicit drug use patterns.\r"

Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from multiple blood samples drawn over 60 hours. Total body clearance of unbound drug, as calculated from the plasma concentration versus time data, was significantly increased in the alcoholic group as compared to the control group (3.12 vs 1.51 L/hr/kg). Terminal elimination half-life was decreased in the alcoholics (7.07 vs 10.12 hr). The fraction of the drug unbound to plasma protein was determined by equilibrium dialysis and was found to be decreased in the alcoholic group over that found in the controls (29.8 vs 36.4%). All subjects were monitored by EKG during the first 4 hours of sampling. Although there was a small mean decrease in heart rate following infusion, it did not achieve statistical significance. Alcoholics had a greater mean increase in P-R but not QTc intervals than control subjects, a difference that was significant at 45 minutes and 1 hour postinfusion. There were no significant differences in the percentage of subjects with abnormal P-R or QTc intervals between the alcoholic and control groups.\r"

Much of this work has been based on studies of children (under the age of 18). However, few studies have examined the impact of parental drinking on those people once they have reached adulthood. We administered the Rotter Internal/External Locus of Control scale, the self-esteem scale from the Jackson Personality Inventory and the Children of Alcoholics Screening Test to 497 college students. No significant relationships between parental alcoholism and locus of control or self-esteem were found. This finding conflicts with the previous research on children of alcoholics and suggests that caution is necessary before explaining specific personality factors on the basis of parental alcoholism alone.\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess Doppler measurement of tricuspid regurgitation in selecting patients for surgical or nonsurgical management and in evaluating the results. Thirty-three patients who had mitral valve surgery had three ultrasound examinations: before operation, before discharge from hospital, and 2 years after operation. Seventeen patients were assigned to tricuspid annuloplasty and 16 to no procedure. Assignment was based on visual grading of regurgitant velocity maps and intraoperative grading by direct palpation. Before operation patients in the annuloplasty group had larger mean jet velocity areas, right atrial size, and diastolic transvalvular velocities than had the nonsurgical group. However, the overlap of data precluded the definition of thresholds for separating the patients into either of two regimens. Early after operation the patients with annuloplasties showed decreased regurgitant indexes similar to the preoperative levels of patients who had no procedure; the latter preoperative levels had not changed. Late after operation both groups showed stabilization or trends toward less regurgitation, and continued decreases in tricuspid diastolic flow velocities. Thus Doppler ultrasonography played a complementary role in selecting patients for annuloplasty or nonsurgical management and a major role in the longitudinal evaluation of treatment.\r"

The effects of propranolol on cerebral electrical activity in lambs undergoing a 90-minute period of circulatory arrest after initial surface cooling to 26 degrees C and subsequent core cooling to 15 degrees C was studied by means of the cerebral function analyzing monitor. Five of the lambs were pretreated with intravenous propranolol 0.2 mg/kg (group I) and five acted as controls (group II). The surface cooling phase was associated with a continuous decrease in mean electroencephalographic voltage +/- standard error, which decreased from 82.8 +/- 11.8 microV at 37 degrees C to 31.6 +/- 2.4 microV at 26 degrees C in the control group compared with 75.0 +/- 7.4 microV and 63.2 +/- 9.2, respectively, in the propranolol group (p less than 0.05). During the rewarming phase, the latency to (1) initial appearance of electrical activity, (2) continuous recording with the cerebral function analyzing monitor, and (3) maximum voltage and frequency recovery was 2.0 +/- 1, 5.9 +/- 4, and 32.4 +/- 8 minutes in the propranolol group, which was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) shorter than in the control group (18.4 +/- 3, 38.2 +/- 5, and 111.0 +/- 9 minutes, respectively). These results suggest that pretreatment with propranolol may play an important part in the brain tolerance to deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest.\r"

  ".U": "90294656\r", 
  ".W": "The need to support the distal circulation during aortic crossclamping and the subsequent effects on hemodynamics and organ perfusion prompted our review of 51 patients who underwent repair of aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta from 1983 through 1987. Forty-three patients had aneurysms originating distal to the left subclavian artery, and eight had aneurysms involving the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta; 10 patients had emergency operation for aneurysm rupture. Three different techniques were used: Seventeen patients had left atrial-distal aorta arterial bypass with a centrifugal pump, 18 patients had a Gott shunt, and 16 patients had no circulatory support during aneurysm repair. Location and type of aneurysm, age, sex, diabetes, preoperative hypertension, and serum lipid levels were similar in the three groups. Duration of crossclamping was 54 +/- 12 minutes for left atrial-aortic assist, 45 +/- 5 for the shunt group, and 34 +/- 4 for patients without circulatory support. With crossclamping, all groups had similar and significant increases in heart rate (p less than 0.03). Proximal systolic blood pressure did not change during left atrial-aortic assist, but a transient increase occurred in patients with shunts (p less than 0.01), and a sustained increase occurred in patients without circulatory support (p less than 0.05). With crossclamp release, arterial pH and capillary pulmonary wedge pressure decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) in patients without shunt or bypass. Postoperative renal function did not vary significantly when circulatory support was used, but serum creatinine rose transiently in patients with unsupported aortic crossclamping. We conclude that support of the distal circulation during thoracic aortic crossclamping stabilizes hemodynamics and prevents systemic acidosis and renal ischemia. Further, our data suggest that the centrifugal pump may provide better protection than a passive shunt.\r"

In a second group of dogs, L-carnitine, an essential cofactor for transfer of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, was applied. Organ function after pulmonary artery flushing with modified Euro-Collins solution and hypothermic storage for 4 hours was adequate in both groups, with significantly higher arterial oxygen pressure levels in the L-carnitine group after 12 (p less than 0.05) and 24 (p less than 0.025) hours, respectively. In the control group, a reduction of the dipalmitoyl-phosphotidylcholine portion on total phosphotidylcholines was observed 4 and 12 hours after transplantation of the left lung (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.01, respectively, both specified by Student's t test for dependent data, not significant by Bonferroni correction). In the simultaneously stored right lungs, a constant fall of the dipalmitoyl-phosphotidylcholine portion was demonstrated. In the L-carnitine group, significantly higher dipalmitoyl-phosphotidylcholine levels were observed in the transplanted left lungs after 4 hours (p less than 0.01) and in the continuously stored right lungs after 24 hours (p less than 0.005), when compared with the control group. These results suggest that dipalmitoyl-phosphotidylcholine portion on total phosphotidylcholine decreases parallel to the extent of the ischemic damage. Furthermore, the application of L-carnitine improved pulmonary function after transplantation, possibly by reducing the impairing effect of ischemia on alveolar type II cell metabolism and thereby on pulmonary surfactant system.\r"

Twelve prostheses were implanted in the tricuspid position in weanling (3- to 4-month-old, 26 +/- 3 kg) sheep. The valve sizes were 23 mm (eight animals) and 25 mm (four animals). There were two early deaths, and the 10 survivors were killed in a stepwise manner to get a mineralization profile of the valve. There was one episode of acute thrombosis but no evidence of pulmonary thromboemboli in any animal. In all cases the leaflets were thin and unretracted, but in half of them one cusp or more were stiffened. One valve displayed a fixed outward eversion of the free margin of two leaflets. Macroscopic calcification was detected in seven specimens and always involved the commissural areas. Radiologic studies confirmed this calcium topography and revealed only one case of severe and diffuse mineralization. In most cases the cusps showed a grossly visible pannus that was thinner and less extensive than usually seen in bioprostheses. Examination with light microscopy disclosed a complete lack of infiltrating cells within the cuspal material (made of compact polytetrafluoroethylene). However, those parts of the prostheses made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (the material covering the valve frame and the sutures) did show infiltration by host cells and calcium. Mineralized lesions were of extrinsic type, involving fibrin and fibroelastic host tissue accumulated in the inflow aspect of the commissures. Examination with transmission electron microscopy disclosed electron-dense masses surrounded by an electron-lucent granular homogeneous material in areas of mineralization. The time-course evolution of the tissue calcium content shows a moderate mineralization rate (0.46 +/- 0.31 mg/gm of dry-weight material per week of follow-up) and a marginally significant positive correlation between calcium content and follow-up. Our results suggest that the polytetrafluoroethylene valves have a moderate overall calcification rate and that calcium deposits appear to be always related to the commissural region and to the presence of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene.\r"

  ".W": "Glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine pericardium was tested for its ability to induce immunologic responses in vivo. Sections of glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine pericardium were implanted between the abdominal muscles of rats and guinea pigs. Control animals received Dacron implants. Lymphocytes and sera from animals were isolated at 2 and 4 weeks after implantation (four animals per group per time). Tritiated thymidine incorporation and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to measure T- and B-lymphocyte responses to glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine pericardium antigens. At the same time points, implants and surrounding tissue from all animals were processed for histologic data. Results show that T-lymphocytes from animals with glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine pericardium implants responded significantly (p less than 0.001) to glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine pericardium antigens in vitro but not to Dacron. In contrast, lymphocytes from animals with Dacron implants failed to respond to glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine pericardium or Dacron preparations. Results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay show that animals with glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine pericardium implants produced antibody directed against glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine pericardium antigens. Histologic study revealed a dense mononuclear and multinuclear giant cell infiltrate at the interface between glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine pericardium and surrounding host tissues, with focal degradation of implant collagen. Dacron elicited a nonspecific lymphocytic and foreign body-type reaction. These results indicate that glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine pericardium can induce immunologic responses in vivo consistent with a host-versus-graft reaction.\r"

Airway obstruction occurred in 12 infants who had operations for congenital heart disease. In all cases tracheography demonstrated the cause of airway obstruction. Significant mortality (5/12, 41.7%) and morbidity in this group of infants were the result of airway obstruction. To reduce the complications caused by airway obstruction in infants with congenital heart disease, we recommend (1) preoperative identification of patients with potential airway obstruction, (2) preoperative tracheography in high-risk infants, (3) appropriate choice of the surgical procedure, especially when insertion of a prosthetic conduit is required, (4) early recognition of the problem during the postoperative period, (5) prompt diagnosis by postoperative tracheography, with or without angiography, and (6) therapy directed at the cause of airway obstruction.\r"

A woman previously operated on for invasive cervical carcinoma had multiple embolic phenomena and evidence of obstruction to mitral flow. An echocardiogram showed a mass in the left atrium that reached the mitral valve ring. The tumor was implanted in a pulmonary vein and was removed with no complications. Cell type indicated metastatic carcinoma of the cervix. In the second case the patient had a large abdominal mass and precordial manifestations of obstruction and regurgitation of the tricuspid valve. An echocardiogram showed that a mass emanating from the inferior vena cava filled the right atrium and part of the right ventricle. The trajectory of the tumor was followed to its origin in an ovarian vein by tomography. The entire tumor was removed and identified as endometrial stromal sarcoma. An increase in operations with or without radiation therapy for malignant tumors has augmented the frequency of metastatic invasion of the heart; intracavitary extension tends to results from embolization or propagation along great veins. This is the first report of a uterine carcinoma reaching the heart by way of the pulmonary veins and of invasion of the heart by endometrial stromal sarcoma, both with successful excision.\r"

  ".W": "A solution developed at the University of Wisconsin is an excellent preservation solution for the kidney, pancreas, and liver. We studied the effectiveness of a modified University of Wisconsin solution, which was made by reversing the sodium and potassium concentrations, in heart preservation. We first examined the relationship between total ischemic time and 1-week graft survival rates using a saline solution as a control preservation solution by transplanting a heart to the neck of test animals. To determine preserved heart viability, we palpated the heart 1 week postoperatively. The 1-week graft survival rates for the various total ischemic times were as follows: less than 1 hour, six of six; 4 hours, five of six; 8 hours, two of six, 12 hours, one of six; and 16 hours, one of six. These results demonstrate a correlation between total ischemic time and survival rate. Then we compared three preservation solutions--glucose-insulin-potassium, Bretschneider's solution, and the modified University of Wisconsin solution--for 16 hours of simple preservation. The 1-week graft survival rates were one of six for glucose-insulin-potassium, two of six for Bretschneider's solution, and five of six for the modified University of Wisconsin solution. The high survival rate for the modified University of Wisconsin solution under adverse conditions indicates its effectiveness in heart preservation.\r"

  ".U": "90294673\r", 
  ".W": "Forty-five patients (36 male and nine female) were treated for postpneumonectomy empyema. All were initially managed with the first stage of the Clagett procedure (open pleural drainage). In 28 patients with associated bronchopleural fistula the fistula was closed and reinforced with muscle transposition at the time of open drainage. Seven patients had multiple flaps. The serratus anterior muscle was transposed in 28 patients, latissimus dorsi in 11, pectoralis major in four, pectoralis minor in one, and rectus abdominis in one patient. After the fistula was closed and the pleural cavity was clean, the second stage of the Clagett procedure (obliteration of the pleural cavity with antibiotic solution and closure of the open pleural window) was done. The number of operative procedures ranged from 1 to 19 (median 5.0). Length of hospitalization ranged from 4 to 137 days (median 34.0 days). There were six operative deaths (mortality rate 13.3%), none in the patients who had both stages of the Clagett procedure. Follow-up of the 39 operative survivors ranged from 2.1 to 90.2 months (median 21.8 months). Eighty-four percent of patients in whom the Clagett procedure was completed (26/31) had a healed chest wall with no evidence of recurrent infection. The bronchopleural fistula remained closed in 85.7% of patients (24/28). There were 19 late deaths, none related to postpneumonectomy empyema. We conclude that the Clagett procedure remains safe and effective in the management of postpneumonectomy empyema in the absence of bronchopleural fistula and that intrathoracic muscle transposition to reinforce the bronchial stump is an effective procedure in the control of postpneumonectomy-associated bronchopleural fistula.\r"

  ".W": "Postoperative mediastinitis remains a serious surgical problem, complicating 0.4% to 5% of all cases. In an experiment designed to address this problem, 36 mongrel dogs underwent a median sternotomy incision. In group I (n = 18) all layers to the sternum were opened by a scalpel, and electrocautery was used only for pinpoint hemostasis. In group II (n = 18) the skin was opened by a scalpel and the remaining layers to the sternum were opened by electrocautery. Total kilojoules of electrical energy delivered to the tissues was 9.4 +/- 5.7 for group I and 44.1 +/- 7.0 for group II (p less than 0.001). Each group was randomly divided into three subgroups (n = 6): Ia and IIa were noninoculated controls; Ib and IIb were inoculated just before skin closure; Ic and IIc were inoculated and given one preoperative dose of cefonicid. The inoculum contained Staphylococcus intermedius in a 0.5 ml suspension of 10(8) organisms. Each animal was observed and the wounds were scored daily until death or until all survivors were put to death on the eighth postoperative day. Pleural fluid was cultured at autopsy. Ten dogs died of mediastinitis (four in IIa and six in IIb), but none from group I (p less than 0.01). Positive cultures from pleural fluid in matching subgroups (n = 6) occurred as follows: one in Ia and five in IIa (p less than 0.05); one in Ib and six in IIb (p less than 0.01); zero in Ic and two in IIc. We conclude that pinpoint hemostasis on the soft tissues of the sternotomy incision significantly reduces the severity and frequency of penetrating mediastinitis.\r"

We evaluated the infection-promoting potential of sterile bone wax in a rat model of chronic Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis. The addition of bone wax greatly reduced the quantitative bacterial inoculum (log colony-forming units) required to establish chronic osteomyelitis in 50% and 100% of challenged animals. The 50% infection rate was reduced from log 6.9 to 2.6 and the 100% infection rate from 8.2 to 4.4, respectively (p less than 0.015, t test for parallelism). Separate experiments were done 10 to 30 minutes after inoculation with only log 6.4 staphylococci. Tibiae of animals that received bone wax yielded more organisms than those that did not (log 2.76 +/- 0.68 versus 1.72 +/- 0.94, p less than 0.01). At 24 hours quantitative colony counts were not significantly different whether animals received wax or not (log 5.02 +/- 0.42 versus 4.43 +/- 0.65, p greater than 0.09). These studies suggest that the routine surgical use of bone wax should be reassessed.\r"

Patients' ages ranged from 18 to 79 years (mean age 48.7 years). Mitral valve insufficiency was due to degenerative disease in 113 patients (58%), rheumatic disease in 74 (38%), ischemia and other causes in eight patients (4%). A total of 188 patients (9.7%) were in New York Heart Association class III or IV preoperatively and 94 (48%) had atrial fibrillation. The patients were divided into three functional groups: type I (normal leaflet motion), 35 patients (18%); type II (leaflet prolapse), 147 patients (75%); and type III (restricted leaflet motion), 13 patients (7%). The techniques included prosthetic ring annuloplasty (185 patients), leaflet resection (158 patients), chordal shortening (89 patients), leaflet mobilization (10 patients) and papillary muscle reimplantation (2 patients). Long-term follow-up was available in 189 patients (96.8%), for a rate of 2316 patients per year. The 15-year actuarial and valve-related survival rates were 72.4% and 82.8%, respectively. At 15 years, 93.9% of the patients were free from thromboembolism, 96.6% free from endocarditis, 95.6% free from anticoagulant-related hemorrhage, and 87.38% free from reoperation. Actuarial rate of freedom from reoperation was higher in the group with degenerative disease (92.7%) than in the group with rheumatic disease (76.12%). Among the 157 survivors, 117 (74%) were in New York Heart Association class I and class II and 105 (66%) were in sinus rhythm. Doppler echocardiographic studies showed normal ventricular contractility in 134 patients (84.5%), absence of mitral regurgitation in 112 (74%), trivial regurgitation in 27 (17%), and significant regurgitation in 4 patients (2.5%).\r"

It would be highly desirable to base a decision to operate for the diagnosis and management of PLFs on a database that includes quantitative test data, which confirms, with a high probability, a clinical suspicion of PLF. This article reviews progress in the development of a test of the vestibular response to external auditory canal pressure changes as recorded by dynamic posturography. Based on results to date, it appears that a fistula test with dynamic posturography is more sensitive than those based on VOR responses. This may be due to the ability of dynamic posturography to isolate vestibular from both visual and somatosensory influences on motor responses during external canal pressure changes.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the course of patients with primary liver cancer who are negative for hepatitis B surface antigen has been debated. We used the polymerase chain reaction to evaluate 28 such patients for the presence of DNA and RNA sequences of the virus; 22 of these patients had associated cirrhosis. The patients were from areas with different prevalences of HBV infection (South Africa, Italy, France, and Japan). RESULTS. Antibodies to the surface and core antigens of HBV were detected in 10 of the 23 patients tested. HBV DNA sequences were detected in 17 of the 28 patients, including 8 of the 10 with HBV antibodies and 6 of 13 without HBV serologic markers. HBV RNA molecules were found in four of five tumors tested. CONCLUSIONS. Our investigation indicates that transcriptionally active HBV genomes are present in various geographic areas among patients with liver cancer who are negative for hepatitis B surface antigen. This observation is consistent with an etiologic role for the virus in the development of these tumors.\r"
