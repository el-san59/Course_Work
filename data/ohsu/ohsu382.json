Nitrofurantoin is effective therapeutically for the treatment of acute lower tract infections, chronic UTI, and for the suppression of catheter-associated bacteria. On a prophylactic basis it is used to sterilize urine before TURP and to prevent chronic reinfection. Its unique mechanism of action, site specificity, achievement of high urinary levels and low serum concentrations, and its effectiveness against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria provide many advantages in UTI therapy that many of the newer agents do not. Adverse drug reactions, especially pulmonary toxicity, are extremely rare, and nitrofurantoin maintains an excellent safety profile.\r"

The 24-hour ambulatory ECG, employed for assessing antiarrhythmic efficacy, was analyzed blindly. The median reduction in the number of PVCs was higher with propafenone than with disopyramide (91.4% vs. 63.5%, respectively, p less than 0.01). A reduction of at least 80% was achieved by propafenone in 22 (59%) and by disopyramide in 16 patients (43%) (NS). Ventricular tachycardias (VTs) were abolished by propafenone in eight out of 11, and by disopyramide in five out of nine patients with VTs (NS) a possible proarrhythmic effect was seen in three patients during disopyramide and in one patient during propafenone treatment. Micturition disturbances (p less than 0.001) and a dry mouth (p less than 0.01) were more commonly associated with disopyramide than with propafenone. In conclusion, in the given dosages, propafenone was superior to disopyramide in suppressing PVCs and had fewer side-effects.\r"

After 4 weeks of treatment all beta-blockers reduced melatonin excretion, but the effect was significant only for metoprolol. Sleep disturbance records revealed more disturbed nights in the metoprolol group compared with the propranolol and the atenolol groups, even when the difference in age between the groups was controlled for. In the metoprolol group a significant relationship (p less than 0.05) was found between the fall in melatonin and the percentage of disturbed nights. Severe CNS side-effects, such as nightmares, occurred only in patients treated with metoprolol (21%), which in all cases were accompanied by low levels of melatonin. Our data suggest that the CNS side-effects during beta-blockade are related to a reduction of melatonin levels.\r"

Such an imbalance between energy production and energy utilization would have important implications for the management of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), most important of which is that therapeutic measures that increase myocardial energy demand could have long-term detrimental effects on the heart. By increasing energy expenditure, vasoconstrictors and positive inotropic agents could worsen cell damage, exacerbate relaxation abnormalities and promote arrhythmias. Conversely, therapy that improved the balance between energy delivery and energy expenditure might be expected to improve prognosis in CHF. For this reason, vasodilators and reduced inotropic drive to the failing heart could prolong survival in these patients. Further understanding of the energetics of the failing heart will be of considerable importance in the formulation of hypotheses regarding long-term therapy that could be evaluated in controlled clinical trials.\r"

The causes of these symptoms may be different in various entities encompassed by the general term heart failure, such as acute pulmonary edema, circulatory collapse and chronic heart failure. In patients with acute heart failure, shortness of breath is closely related to left atrial pressure. In patients with chronic heart failure, optimally treated with diuretics, the body fluid compartments are usually of normal size. Recent work strongly suggests that, in such patients, central hemodynamic abnormalities are not the sole determinants of symptoms. Impaired vasodilation and altered metabolism in skeletal muscle, circulating metabolites and pulmonary ventilation-perfusion mismatch with consequent increased physiologic dead space may all contribute to the genesis of symptoms. Consequently, it may be possible to alleviate symptoms by treatments that are not aimed directly at improving central hemodynamics. Whether such an approach could also modify prognosis is unknown.\r"

Trials undertaken before the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS) revealed favorable trends among patients in New York Heart Association functional classes II to IV who received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Data from CONSENSUS clearly demonstrate that enalapril reduces mortality rates among patients in New York Heart Association class IV, but conclusions regarding effects in patients with mild or moderate CHF must await the results of future studies. In contrast, the large data base on alpha-adrenergic blockers suggests that these drugs are not likely to improve survival. Information on inotropic agents is sparse, but it is possible that these drugs may not improve survival and, in fact, may have a harmful effect. Mortality data on CHF patients treated with beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are likewise limited; conclusions concerning effects on survival must be postponed until further studies are conducted. Many of the investigations undertaken thus far to examine survival in patients with CHF have been small and of short duration, so any comparisons of the effects of various drugs must be interpreted with caution.\r"

Agents with an arteriolar-dilating effect are more likely to be effective in patients with higher left ventricular outflow resistance. Vasodilators with primary venodilating properties are more likely to be effective in the presence of an increased ventricular preload. The mechanisms by which preload and left ventricular outflow resistance increase in patients with cardiac insufficiency are not well understood and may not be similar in all patients. Vasodilators also have the capacity to ameliorate myocardial metabolic functional abnormalities by influencing myocardial energetics, but the effects of different agents on coronary hemodynamics may not be uniform. Effects on renal hemodynamics may also vary, as may neurohumoral changes after therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to exert beneficial effects on both coronary and renal hemodynamics in patients with chronic heart failure, while producing favorable neurohumoral changes. These agents provide some advantages over direct-acting vasodilators in that myocardial oxygen consumption is decreased, myocardial metabolic function is improved, and norepinephrine and aldosterone levels are reduced. Further controlled studies are needed to assess the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in relation to other vasodilators for the long-term management of these patients.\r"

Although survival can be related to the extent of cardiac functional impairment, many patients die suddenly rather than in refractory heart failure. Ambulatory electrocardiography has revealed a high prevalence of simple and complex ventricular arrhythmias in these patients, which was the most important predictor of subsequent mortality in our patients. Factors predisposing to arrhythmias are many, but increased catecholamines and electrolyte abnormalities are among the more obvious. In patients who have undergone treatment for congestive heart failure, serum and total body potassium are reduced, and this is closely and inversely related to the state of activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Renin and noradrenaline are also closely and directly correlated, while both are inversely related to the arterial pressure. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors tends to reverse these neuroendocrine and electrolyte abnormalities and reduces the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias. Whether this will have a favorable impact on mortality, and, in particular, on sudden death, remains to be seen.\r"

Follow-up averaged 188 days (range 1 day to 20 months). The reduction in crude mortality within 6 months (primary objective) was 40% in the enalapril-treated group (from 44 to 26%, p = 0.002) and within 1 year 31% (p = 0.001). By the end of the study, 68 subjects in the placebo group and 50 in the enalapril group had died--a reduction of 27% (p = 0.003). The entire reduction in total mortality (50%) was found in patients dying from progressive heart failure, whereas no difference was seen in the incidence of sudden cardiac death. There was a significant improvement in New York Heart Association classification in the enalapril group, together with a reduction in heart size and a reduced requirement for other heart failure medication. It is concluded that the addition of enalapril to conventional therapy in patients with severe congestive heart failure can reduce mortality and improve symptoms. The effect seems to be due to a reduction in death from progression of heart failure.\r"

Enalapril was administered in a dose of 2.5 to 40 mg/day. The placebo group was administered placebo tablets in addition to their conventional therapeutic regimen. The study was discontinued prematurely for ethical reasons because of the highly significant (p = 0.003) difference in mortality between the enalapril (n = 50) and placebo groups (n = 68).

Favorable hemodynamic responses, apparent both at rest and during exercise, result from a considerable reduction in both systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, apparently due to both the arterial and venodilating effects of these agents. In addition, the recently reported results of the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study demonstrate that ACE inhibitors reduce mortality rates in patients with CHF. The etiology of heart failure does not seem to predict clinical response to ACE inhibitors, nor do acute resting and exercise hemodynamic responses. A weak relation has been found between plasma renin activity and short-term hemodynamic and clinical responses, but this association is not evident over the long term. Therefore, a trial of therapy with ACE inhibitors is necessary to judge efficacy in an individual patient with advanced CHF symptoms. Two such agents--captopril and enalapril--are available. The former has a more rapid onset and shorter duration of action, whereas the latter may be given on a twice-daily basis, simplifying chronic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Congestive heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by a number of neuroendocrine responses. These responses are probably an evolutionary vestige of mechanisms designed to defend volume and maintain circulatory homeostasis. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the release of vasopressin have been clearly documented in patients with heart failure. Unlike the normal ventricle, the failing ventricle responds to peripheral vasoconstriction and sodium retention with further hemodynamic embarrassment and circulatory congestion. Certain vasorelaxant natriuretic substances are also released during heart failure, perhaps in an attempt to offset excessive peripheral constriction and sodium retention. Prostaglandin E2, atrial natriuretic peptide (or atrial natriuretic factor) and plasma dopamine are found to be increased in some patients with heart failure. However, peripheral constriction and sodium retention appear to be dominant, particularly in the advanced stages of heart failure. An understanding of these neuroendocrine responses has led to new developments in therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have emerged as distinctly useful drugs in the treatment of heart failure. Agents designed to block excessive sympathetic drive and inhibit vasopressin are under investigation. Infusion of atrial natriuretic factors and the use of selective dopamine agonists are also undergoing clinical trials in patients with heart failure. Increased knowledge of the neuroendocrine responses will likely result in even newer and more imaginative therapy.\r"

All diets were designed to be individually isoenergetic. Fasting plasma glucose fell significantly during the HCF diet and then rose significantly during the last LCF diet. Dietary change rather than hospitalization had its full effect by 18 d. Urinary glucose excretion rose transiently on the HCF diet before also falling significantly. Similarly, pancreatic immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) fell significantly on the HCF diet and increased significantly on the LCF diet. No significant differences were observed in plasma insulin, serum free fatty acids, or monocyte insulin binding activity between the two diets. Reduction in circulating IRG may in part explain the lower fasting (or basal) plasma glucose observed on HCF diets.\r"

In CRI after AA ingestion, splanchnic exchange area for total nonessential AAs (NEAAs) is increased 135% over control subjects because of an augmented escape of proline, glutamate, serine, glycine, alanine, and cyst(e)ine; contrarily, glutamine shows an increased splanchnic uptake. Splanchnic exchange area for total essential AAs (EAAs) is increased only by 67% over controls because of a higher escape of threonine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and histidine. Abnormalities in arterial areas for AAs parallel those in splanchnic areas except for glutamine and isoleucine. Data indicate that in CRI, at least for 70 min after an AA meal, splanchnic organs metabolize abnormally ingested AAs and export an increased and unbalanced bulk of AAs, severely affecting postprandial arterial profile of AAs.\r"

Other notable histopathologic findings were the fascicular growth pattern of the tumor and the very convoluted nuclei of the lymphoblasts. At present, only few cases of this rare immunophenotype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have been reported in children. A panel of monoclonal antibodies is suggested to be applied on frozen tissue sections in order to establish a precise diagnosis in childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, which should ultimately have therapeutic and prognostic impact.\r"

IgE antibodies in patient serum reacted specifically to larval Anisakis antigens but not to larval Ascaris antigens in the RAST. IgG and IgM antibodies to larval Anisakis antigen could be detected by ELISA up to six months after infection. IFA findings demonstrated that patient serum recognized the excretory-secretory products produced by the worm and showed their presence in vivo. These products appear to originate from the excretory pore and dorsal esophageal gland of the larval parasite.\r"

  ".W": "In order to maximize staining, modifications of immunostaining methods have included proteolytic enzyme digestion of tissue. The authors performed a study of the effect of ficin in 110 paraffinized specimens, including tonsil, lymph nodes, benign vascular and nerve sheath tumors, and various carcinomas and sarcomas. This agent was compared with pepsin and bromelain, as alternative proteases. A panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies was used, with and without previous digestion by ficin, pepsin, and bromelain. A score was assigned to each stain, based on the number and intensity of reactive cells. Ficin enhanced staining markedly in immunostains with antibodies to keratin and Factor VIII-related antigen (F8RAG). Conversely, it abolished staining for LN-2 (a lymphoid marker) and weakened reactivity for S-100 in nerve sheath tumors. Bromelain produced similar results, except that it enhanced S-100. Pepsin was comparatively less active than ficin and bromelain overall but did produce the greatest amplification of vimentin staining in sarcomas. Digestion with any of the three enzymes failed to influence reactivities of leukocyte common antigen, UCHL-1 (a lymphoid marker), alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, carcinoembryonic antigen, epithelial membrane antigen, and blood group isoantigens. These results may reflect a dissimilar recognition of peptide targets in some antigenic proteins, by ficin, bromelain, and pepsin. Hence, one enzymatic agent is unlikely to produce optimal staining for all determinants. With this proviso, however, ficin appeared to be the best general enhancer for antigens known to require vigorous digestion (e.g., keratin; F8RAG) for optimal reactivity in paraffin sections.\r"

Accurate classification according to the Working Formulation was possible in six cases, with diagnosis of diffuse small non-cleaved non-Burkitt's in three, large cell immunoblastic in two, and mixed small and large cell type in one. Five additional cases were diagnosed as high-grade lymphoma but could not be further subclassified because of the small biopsy size or formalin fixation. Immunocytochemical stains for lymphoid markers on paraffin-embedded material confirmed the diagnosis in ten cases, and, in one of these, the demonstration of monoclonality on air-dried cytospins identified an atypical polymorphous lymphocytic population as neoplastic.\r"

In addition, after this time CMV late antigen (LA) was detected in the inoculated cells. On the seventh day, CMV was recovered from the culture medium, and infected beta cells were identified by use of a double-label antibody technique. However, CMV apparently did not cause direct destruction of beta cells nor did infection by CMV lead to changes in production of insulin as measured by radioimmunoassay. Thus, despite the fact that CMV can successfully infect a variety of cells in fetal islets of Langerhans, the absence of a significant effect on beta cells does not support the notion that congenital CMV infection is involved in the origin of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

Blood vessels, especially in peritumoral colonic submucosa, gave markedly different images after staining by antivitronectin antibody and antifibronectin serum. The former exclusively decorated the elastic laminae, whereas the latter gave a reaction much closer to the endothelium, probably localized at the basement membrane of the endothelium. Strong labeling of colonic and mammary stroma carcinomas by polyclonal antiserum against fibronectin was observed, whereas monoclonal antibody against vitronectin gave much more restricted labeling in the stroma of these tumors. In the stroma of colonic carcinomas, vitronectin was often situated in areas in which elastic fibers were visualized by orcein counterstaining. In breast stroma carcinomas it was always localized only in elastosis areas. Thus, it is likely that antivitronectin binds with glycoprotein(s) associated with elastic fibers. However, vitronectin staining also was seen in areas in which no elastic fibers were characterized by the orcein method.\r"

Using polarized microscopy and electron microscopy, the authors observed starch particles in renal perfusate and in glomeruli of perfused donor kidneys. Group 1 consisted of 10 unusable kidneys handled with standard concern of glove sterility. Eight other kidneys (Group 2) were perfused with particular attention toward avoidance of starch contamination. The gloves were rinsed five times, and the cuffs were not dipped into the perfusate. Two kidneys (Group 3), deemed unsuitable for transplantation, were perfused for 24 hours with perfusate swished with unwashed sterile gloves. Group 4 consisted of five transplant biopsies performed within one week after transplantation. Perfusates alone were also circulated through the Waters Perfusion Machine continuously for 24, 72, and 188 hours with and without the use of gloves. The number of birefringent crosses were counted in each of 25 glomeruli per specimen. Group 1 displayed a mean of 1.8 birefringent crosses per glomerulus; Group 2, 0; Group 3, 5.3; and Group 4, 4.4. Groups 1 and 3 also exhibited birefringent crosses in peripheral renal vessels. Perfusate alone, handled without gloves, showed no birefringent crosses; by contrast, perfusate handled with gloves showed numerous birefringent crosses. The authors conclude that starch from surgical gloves can enter the perfusate and lodge in glomeruli and other sites of donor kidneys. Rinsing gloves five times and avoiding contact of the perfusate with the glove cuff effectively eliminates the contamination.\r"

They also reviewed patient clinical charts to determine the clinical impact of the organisms recovered on days 6 and 7. Of 9,062 blood culture vials processed in a nine-week period, 547 had positive results (6% of vials and 10.3% of culture sets). Isolates on day 6 or 7 accounted for 19 (3.5%) of the total; 4 of these were believed to be clinically important by the patients' attending physicians. Detection of these four cultures required processing of 9,062 vials twice each. These data suggest that in our patient population the clinical benefit of testing on days 6 and 7 does not justify its cost. Whether this would be true in other settings would have to be determined by the individual hospital.\r"

  ".W": "Transplantation of infants less than 1 year of age with kidneys from live-related parental donors has recently led to good results, whereas cadaver donor renal transplantation in this recipient age group has led to a high mortality rate (11/13). Similarly, the results of cadaver donor renal transplantation in infants and young children less than 5 years of age has been suboptimal in the past, although recent data are more encouraging. With recent availability of long-term peritoneal dialysis for the infant and young child with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), it is possible to defer transplantation until an optimal donor becomes available. Because of the possible immunologic hyperactivity of such recipients, the immunosuppressive regimen may need to be modified if improved cadaver donor survival rates are to be obtained. The use of anencephalic kidneys for transplantation has been associated with a high incidence of primary nonfunction and few recipients with long-term functioning grafts. Harvesting of kidneys from anencephalic donors declared \"brain-dead\" at birth may reduce the incidence of primary nonfunction and increase the availability of anencephalic kidneys for transplantation. Reports of the use of pediatric cadaver kidneys for transplantation into pediatric and adult recipients yields discrepant results. Analysis of the data indicates that if pediatric cadaver kidneys from donors less than 6 years of age are used, the potential for decreased graft survival rates and an increased incidence of technical complications exists. However, the use of pediatric cadaver kidneys can provide adequate graft function in both pediatric and adult recipients and the use of such kidneys should increase the number of kidneys available for transplantation.\r"

All of the recipients were followed for over 6 months after transplantation. There were no differences in age, sex, Broca index, family history, and preoperative evaluation on diabetic dispositions between the two treatment groups. The incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) requiring insulin therapy was higher in CsA-treated recipients (18/105, 17.1%) than in Az-treated recipients (23/180, 12.8%; P less than 0.05), although both the daily Pred and cumulative doses of methylprednisolone (MP) at the onset of DM were significantly smaller in the CsA group than in the Az group (26.1 +/- 2.2 mg v 41.4 +/- 3.4 mg, P less than 0.01 and 3,086 +/- 626 mg v 7,133 +/- 1,129 mg, P less than 0.01, respectively). Diabetic patients with CsA showed higher levels of blood glucose (401 +/- 46 mg/dL), but lower amounts of urinary glucose (40 +/- 4.3 g/d) compared with patients treated with Az (239 +/- 31 mg/dL, and 61.4 +/- 4.6 g/d, respectively, P less than 0.05). In the CsA group, the onset of DM was related to high CsA plasma trough levels (greater than 350 ng/mL) in 23% of patients.

Twenty-four-hour urine protein excretion at the time of renal allograft biopsy ranged from 5.9 to 17.0 g/24 hours. The serum creatinine at the time of renal allograft biopsy ranged from 2.0 to 3.9 mg/dl (180 to 350 mumol/L). Biopsies of the allografts demonstrated minimal glomerular abnormalities by light microscopy, immunomicroscopy, and electron microscopy. Two biopsies exhibited severe interstitial fibrosis. These four cases illustrate the unusual finding of \"minimal change glomerulopathy\" in renal allograft recipients exhibiting nephrotic range proteinuria. All four patients progressed to dialysis 4, 36, 46, and 53 months after transplantation. Transplant nephrectomy was performed in three patients. One showed acute cortical necrosis. Two showed glomerular, vascular, and tubular-interstitial features of chronic rejection.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: It is generally assumed that diet therapy can ameliorate the metabolic derangements experienced by obese type 2 diabetic patients, thereby leading to discontinuation of insulin or oral sulfonylurea drug therapy. We decided to retrospectively investigate which clinical and biochemical parameters affect therapeutic responses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four poorly controlled obese diabetic patients were hospitalized and placed on a precisely defined, hypocaloric diet. Known duration of diabetes, type of pharmacologic therapy, body weight, weight loss, fasting plasma glucose concentrations, C-peptide levels, hemoglobin A1C, and plasma lipid levels were assessed, as were nitrogen and electrolyte balances. RESULTS: Average weight loss was 13 pounds in a mean of 23 days. During hospitalization, the mean fasting plasma glucose value for the group fell from 221 +/- 10 to 122 +/- 5 mg/dl. In 45 patients (73 percent), the final fasting plasma glucose level was less than 125 mg/dl (mean: 102 +/- 2 mg/dl). Oral glucose tolerance even in those patients in whom fasting plasma glucose levels normalized was still grossly diabetic at the end of the hospital stay, deteriorating further after three days of liberalized caloric intake. In part this may have been due to decreased insulin secretory reserve as reflected by blunted plasma C-peptide response. Forty of 42 patients who entered the study taking insulin were able to discontinue the drug within one to seven days of hospitalization. After a mean follow-up period of 19 months, only 10 of 50 patients continued to maintain fasting euglycemia; five were on diet alone, and five were receiving oral hypoglycemic agents. Thirteen patients were receiving insulin therapy. CONCLUSION: Diet therapy in these patients resulted in short-term improvement of glycemic control and, in the majority, normalization of fasting plasma glucose levels. However, long-term outpatient follow-up revealed that relapse occurred in most patients.\r"

  ".W": "Autoimmunity can be accelerated in several genetically prone murine models and can even be induced in normal mice by treatment with interferon (IFN) or IFN-inducers. Several cases of IFN-induced autoimmune disease in humans also have been observed; however, more striking is the fact that some of the clinical manifestations in autoimmune diseases and many of the immunological aberrations can be mediated or enhanced by IFN. The finding of high levels of circulating IFN in many patients may be highly significant in that respect, and the characterization of the predominant type of IFN as an unusual acid-labile IFN-alpha may indicate an infectious etiologic agent in autoimmunity, since this peculiar IFN was mostly associated with viral infections in vivo or in vitro. The induction of MHC class II antigens on previously HLA-DR or Ia negative cells appears to be caused primarily by IFN-gamma and may have a central role in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity in susceptible individuals. Such aberrant HLA-DR expression on nonlymphoid cells can be detected early in the disease in the target organs of many varied autoimmune conditions and may trigger a cascade of self-directed, uncontrolled immune response in conjunction with other factors.\r"

Interim results on the 1984 service use and cost experience of the health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and competitive medical plans (CMPs) participating in the demonstrations indicate that Medicare enrollees in the demonstration experienced a median of 1,951 hospital days per 1,000 person years, 57 per cent of the median of 3,432 days per 1,000 in the local markets from which the plans drew enrollment. Independent practice association (IPA) HMOs experienced higher hospital use rates than staff and group model HMOs. These comparisons are not adjusted for various risk factors, the absence of which were likely to favor the demonstration plans. Plans with lower hospital service use were federally qualified and had been operating for more than five years. The median total annual revenue per enrollee across all plans was $2,312, compared to median annual expenses per enrollee of $2,250. The distribution of median annual expenses per enrollee by major category of expense was: institutional expenses ($1,038/enrollee), medical expenses ($720/enrollee), supplemental services expenses ($154/enrollee), and administrative and other expenses ($295/enrollee). Future analysis, using beneficiary-level data, will examine the impact of the demonstration and the nature and extent of evident biased selection and will compare the quality of care in the demonstrations to that in the fee-for-service sector.\r"

Although anesthetic conditions were similar during the operation, differences were noted in the recovery characteristics. For non-major (superficial) surgical procedures, the times to awakening, responsiveness, orientation, and ambulation were significantly shorter in the propofol group (4 +/- 3, 5 +/- 4, 6 +/- 4, and 104 +/- 36 min) than in the control group (8 +/- 7, 9 +/- 7, 11 +/- 9, and 142 +/- 61 min, respectively). In addition, less nausea and vomiting (20 vs. 45%) and significantly less psychomotor impairment was noted in the non-major propofol (vs. control) group. Following major abdominal operations, recovery characteristics did not differ between propofol and control groups. Delayed emergence (greater than 20 min), significant psychometric impairment, and a high overall incidence of postoperative side effects (55-60%) were noted in both drug treatment groups. The authors conclude that propofol-nitrous oxide compares favorably to thiopental-isoflurane-nitrous oxide for maintenance of anesthesia during short outpatient procedures. However, for major abdominal operations, propofol anesthesia does not appear to offer any clinically significant advantages over a standard inhalational anesthetic technique.\r"

  ".W": "Since Dale and Laidlaw first produced airway obstruction in animals by infusing histamine, much has been done to understand the role of histamine in hyperreactive airway diseases. Histamine has been found to activate three subtypes of receptors: the H1 subtype, which mediates a number of cellular events resulting in airway obstruction; the H2 subtype, which plays an unclear and perhaps variable role in mediating airway caliber changes; and the newly described H3 subtype, which has not yet been studied in relation to airway caliber. The mechanisms involved in the synthesis, storage, and release of histamine from mast cells and basophils have been described. Pulmonary cells responsible for airway obstruction via H1 receptor stimulation have been identified and include bronchial smooth muscle, epithelial, endothelial, and pulmonary macrophage cells. Radioligand binding studies have begun to characterize the density and affinity of pulmonary H1 receptors. Intracellular events following H1 receptor stimulation have been shown to include calcium influx, phosphatidyl-inositol turnover, increases in cGMP, and the synthesis of prostaglandins. Despite a great deal of effort to define the relation between histamine and the parasympathetic nervous system, their exact interactions leading to changes in airway caliber remain to be resolved. Many pathologic conditions and mediators related to inflammation have been shown to increase histamine-induced airway responsiveness. A few endogenous mediators and a number of pharmacologic agents have been shown to decrease histamine-induced airway responsiveness. Although much has been done to elucidate the role of histamine and the H1 receptor system in modulating airway caliber, much more needs to be done to fully understand the complexities and significance of the H1 receptor system in normal and pathologic states of the airway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term differences in mortality associated with initial Hodgkin disease therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective review of patients treated in prospectively randomized clinical trials. PATIENTS: Three hundred twenty-six patients with pathologic stage I, II, or III, A or B Hodgkin disease treated between 1967 and 1980 with median follow-up exceeding 14 years. INTERVENTIONS: Patients at the same stage of disease were randomized to receive radiation alone (167 patients) or radiation followed by 6 cycles of mechlorethamine hydrochloride, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy (159 patients) with additional therapy for progression or recurrence. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No significant differences between treatment regimens for actuarial survival, intercurrent disease, or Hodgkin disease mortality were seen. Thirty-three patients who received radiation alone and 30 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy died without evident Hodgkin disease. Death was caused by second neoplasms in 28 patients (relative risk, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.46 to 3.24). Six patients developed acute myelogenous leukemia or a myeloproliferative disorder after treatment including MOPP. Chemotherapy exposure varied among the 8 patients with lung cancers, 6 with gastrointestinal and 3 with other adenocarcinomas, 3 with sarcomas, 1 with diffuse large cell lymphoma, and 1 with melanoma. Acute myocardial infarction caused 9 of 17 cardiovascular disease deaths with 5 occurring in patients between the ages of 33 and 43. Nonetheless, the risk for acute myocardial infarction was not clearly increased (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.57). Fifteen patients died from infection: 5, opportunistic; 5, asplenic sepsis; and 5, other pneumonias. Two patients died in accidents, and 1 died from radiation pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant MOPP chemotherapy improved freedom from relapse without significant survival benefit or impairment. Leukemogenesis was the only lethal complication associated with MOPP. Survivors of Hodgkin disease had an increased risk for death from a second neoplasm, but no apparent increased risk for death from acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Yet, major modifiable risk factors for recurrent coronary heart disease, including hypertension, smoking, increased serum cholesterol levels, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity are the same risk factors for its development. Although coronary atherosclerosis is already established in patients who have had a myocardial infarction, evidence suggests that important reductions in recurrent coronary heart disease and death can be achieved through secondary prevention programs that modify risk factors. The high risk for recurrence and mortality in patients who survive a heart attack means that substantial reductions in the rates of these events can be achieved with relatively small reductions in risk factors. Patients who have had a myocardial infarction are also active participants in health care and are likely to be highly motivated to modify their risks for cardiac disease.\r"

During the 10 years it has been used in the United States it has become preferred over estrogens for treating postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer. Recently, tamoxifen has been used in treating premenopausal women with recurrent breast cancer, and its efficacy has been proved equal to that of ovarian ablation. In comparative trials, tamoxifen has been as effective as alternative endocrine treatments, and has greatly reduced toxicity and no irreversible side effects. Because of the high risk for systemic relapse in patients with breast cancer with regional lymph node metastases, (stage II), tamoxifen has been evaluated as adjuvant therapy after local treatment of the tumor. The results of these trials have shown a significant increase in the disease-free survival of postmenopausal women treated with tamoxifen, particularly in patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumors. Tamoxifen has not been as useful as adjuvant treatment in premenopausal women, for whom combination chemotherapy is the treatment of choice.\r"

The four models of decision making are the traditional model, informed consent, collaboration, and patient choice. Misunderstandings about these and other terms arise when they are implied; therefore, they should be defined expressly. Mutual expectations should be ascertained and common misunderstandings that erode relationships and lead to litigation should be clarified. Without agreements, different models may be selected and expectations about responsibility may differ. Such agreements may be documented by notes in patients' charts, supported by intake procedures that teach patients about defining responsibility, and questionnaires that elicit values, needs, and preferences. The literature on the evolution of contract principles in health care is reviewed, with informed consent viewed as a judicial stepping stone from tort to contract. A framework for defining mutual expectations is presented. Physicians' patterns of allocating responsibility by express and implied agreements should be evaluated and changes made where needed.\r"

  ".W": "In polymyositis (PM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM), but not in dermatomyositis there is evidence of cell-mediated cytotoxicity: T8+ cells accompanied by macrophages focally surround, invade, and destroy nonnecrotic muscle fibers. However, the T8 marker appears on both cytotoxic (Tc) and suppressor (Ts) cells. The Leu-15 marker appears on Ts but not on Tc cells, but it also appears on macrophages and on some killer/natural killer cells. To obviate this problem, the T8, Leu-15, and Leu-7 markers were demonstrated by sequential paired immunofluorescence in single cryostat sections. Using this approach, we reliably differentiated for the first time between Tc and Ts cells in tissue sections. Six cell phenotypes were identified: T8+ Leu-15-Leu7- Tc cells, T8+ Leu-15+ Leu-7- Ts cells, three types of Leu-7+ killer/natural killer cells, and T8-Leu-15+ Leu-7- macrophages. Muscle specimens from 5 patients with PM and 5 with IBM were studied. In each case, 6 nonnecrotic muscle fibers focally surrounded and invaded by mononuclear cells were selected randomly. A total of 2,022 mononuclear cells were analyzed, 870 from patients with PM and 1,152 from those with IBM. When counts of the identified cell phenotypes in individual patients were pooled, there were four times as many T8+ Leu-15- Leu-7- Tc cells as T8+ Leu-15+ Leu-7- Ts cells in either PM or IBM samples. However, when the relative frequencies of the Tc and Ts cells were examined in individual patients, the Tc cells tended to become more abundant, and the Ts cells correspondingly less abundant, with the duration of symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The dermal infiltrate was composed of Leu-1-reactive T cells, OKT6-reactive Langerhans' cells, and Leu-M5-reactive (Leu-M5+) macrophages. Among them, the major population consisted of T cells with the predominance of Leu-3a-reactive (Leu-3a+) T cells over Leu-2a-reactive (Leu-2a+) T cells. On the other hand, the epidermotropic mononuclear cells consisted of Leu-2a+ and Leu-3a+ T cells without any predominant pattern, and Leu-M5+ macrophages. Furthermore, note that a pemphiguslike intercellular staining pattern was observed in the epidermis in most of the cases, when the sections were stained either with anti-HLA-DR antibody or with OKT6, suggesting the HLA-DR antigen expression on the keratinocyte surface and possibly an enlargement of Langerhans' cells. Based on these immunohistologic findings, we think that Langerhans' cells play an important role in the pathomechanism of Schamberg's disease, and that cellular immune reactions are taking place in the lesional skin.\r"

Paget cells and surrounding epidermal keratinocytes were equally stained with an antikeratin monoclonal antibody, HKN-4, which recognizes a broad spectrum of keratins. However, Paget cells were clearly distinguished from the surrounding epidermal keratinocytes by HKN-2, which does not react with keratins of secretory cells but does react with keratins of ductal and myoepithelial cells of sweat glands and with epidermis and hair tissue of the normal skin. The HKN-2 did not bind to Paget cells, but the surrounding keratinocytes were positive. CK7, LE41, RGE53, and LP2K, which recognize simple epithelium-type keratins 7 (molecular weight [MW], 54,000; type II), 8 (MW, 52,500; type II), 18 (MW, 45,000; type I), and 19 (MW, 40,000; type I), respectively, stained Paget cells but not the surrounding keratinocytes. Two cases of Merkel cell carcinoma, examined as controls, showed positivity to LE41 and RGE53 but not to CK7 and LP2K. Since in the normal skin the secretory cells of sweat glands showed the same keratin expression as that of Paget cells, Paget cells of extramammary Paget's disease may be derived from or differentiate to the secretory cells of sweat glands.\r"

Distinguishing features of SUKA include pain, rapid growth, and early underlying bony destruction. Unlike keratoacanthomas arising from sun-exposed skin, SUKAs seldom resolve spontaneously and are more locally destructive. Of 18 cases reported in the literature, five patients have developed recurrent disease, all within five months of the initial surgery. We describe a patient with SUKA initially treated by curettage followed two days later by a conservative amputation that revealed conspicuous residual keratoacanthoma. The deep, burrowing tendency of SUKA and the intimate association with underlying bone may explain the reported tendency for recurrence after curettage.\r"

There are few reports of an association between rhinophyma and basal cell carcinoma; but it is claimed that it occurs more frequently than is expected by chance. The evidence for this is reviewed. Previous reports were anecdotal or contained biases that prevent generalization of the results and, in addition, a statistical analysis was incorrect.

In the children who received the combined vaccine, seroconversion was established in 93% for measles, 99% for rubella, and 100% for mumps. In the children who received the single measles vaccine, seroconversion was established in 92% for measles and in none for rubella and mumps. There was no increase in clinical reactions after the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine compared with the measles vaccine.

Many do not have either nodal or distant metastasis. Furthermore, TPE can be curative and often is palliative for similar lesions that are recurrent or nonresponsive to radiation therapy. Operative mortality rates should be under 10% and can be under 5% for primary cases. Although improvement in preoperative management and operative technique, especially with urinary conduits and postoperative care is clear, both early and late complications are significant. Unfortunately, preoperative identification of those patients requiring TPE rather than abdominoperineal or low anterior resection remains poor. Furthermore, recent improvements in techniques for pelvic slings to prevent small bowel entrapment and protection from irradiation or myocutaneous flaps to obliterate the massive dead space are not yet clearly established as preventors of either early or later complications.\r"

For treatment of complications of duodenal ulcer, gastroenterostomy was widely used from the latter part of the 19th century until the late 1930s. Adequate gastric resection slowly but cautiously replaced gastroenterostomy during the 1940s. Vagotomy with drainage and vagotomy with antrectomy slowly developed and replaced adequate resection by the early 1970s. Beginning in the 1970s and extending into the 1980s, fewer duodenal ulcers were seen, and many of those encountered were being adequately managed using the H2 receptor blockers. For the intractable duodenal ulcer there is currently an increasing trend to use the less invasive operation of parietal cell vagotomy. Vagotomy with antrectomy for such cases is being used less frequently. Vagotomy and drainage has lost much of its appeal. Lesser procedures have been advocated recently for treatment of marginal ulcer after incomplete vagotomy irrespective of the original operation for ulcer. Massive bleeding and acute perforation are still frequently encountered as complications but are being seen more frequently in elderly high-risk patients, some of whom will tolerate only a lesser procedure as suture ligation, vagotomy with drainage, or simple ulcer closure. It appears that we are now seeing a different duodenal ulcer pattern in the good-risk patient. The ulcers are usually small, less virulent, and less likely to be found penetrating into the pancreas and adjacent organ structures. As Claude Welch so aptly stated recently before the Association, \"We are seeing a trend in ulcer surgery that is currently being seen in other areas of surgical endeavors as well.\" He emphasized that we must be alert to changing disease patterns and adapt our procedures to new requirements.\r"

In the OP-41483-treated group, serum creatinine levels remained relatively low during postoperative days 1-3 and mean survival time was prolonged. Injection of a silicone rubber vascular casting compound (Microfil) revealed increased numbers of visible renal cortical glomeruli and microvessels compared to the saline vehicle group. Histologic sections showed only very limited tubular necrosis, whereas sections of kidneys treated with saline showed extensive tubular necrosis. In conclusion, this stable prostacyclin analog provided a significant degree of protection for the kidneys from ischemic injury and may be useful in a clinical setting.\r"

  ".W": "Severe trauma results in reversible abnormalities in neutrophil function, but the specific role in the pathogenesis of postoperative sepsis is undetermined. Twenty adult patients undergoing elective surgical procedures were studied. Blood samples were obtained prior to and 24 hours after operation. Blood neutrophils were isolated and incubated (10(7) cells/mL) on bovine vascular endothelial cell monolayers. Untreated plasma or zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP) or 65 C inactivated plasma was added, and TxB2 and 6-keto PGF1 alpha production measured after 2 hours. Endothelial damage was detected by light and scanning electron microscopy beginning 2 and 4 hours after treatment. Preoperatively, neutrophil TxB2 release was less than 200 pg/mL; following ZAP it was 2153 pg/mL (p less than 0.001), with untreated plasma 1055 pg/mL (p less than 0.005) and inactivated plasma 764 pg/mL (p less than 0.01). Neutrophil TxB2 release on a plastic dish was not different from incubation on endothelium. Endothelial 6-keto PGF1 alpha release following addition of untreated plasma preoperatively was 1308 pg/mL (p less than 0.01), and with ZAP 1305 pg/mL (p less than 0.01). Activated neutrophils did not alter 6-keto PGF1 alpha production. Postoperatively, neutrophil TxB2 production in response to ZAP was 1092 pg/mL, which was significantly reduced compared to the preoperative response (p less than 0.01). Endothelial damage by activated neutrophils in the postoperative period demonstrated on scanning electron microscopy was also reduced; 6-keto PGF1 alpha release in the postoperative period inducted by ZAP was 569 pg/mL and by untreated plasma 549 pg/mL, which was significantly lower than in the preoperative period (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05, respectively). No difference in chemotaxis was demonstrated. It is concluded that operative trauma is followed by lowered neutrophil TxB2 release, appearance of a plasmatic factor that depresses endothelial 6-keto PGF1 alpha production, as well as decreased neutrophil-induced endothelial damage. The neutrophil-endothelial monolayer system is a sensitive method for detection of neutrophil and plasmatic dysfunction.\r"

A noninvasive method to quantitatively determine residual urine volumes would decrease unnecessary catheterizations and be useful in the management of an IC program. This study was undertaken to determine if bladder volumes could be accurately determined in a group of SCI patients using a portable ultrasound scanner. Fifteen SCI patients underwent a total of 224 ultrasonic bladder volume determinations and 57 urethral catheterizations. Immediately prior to catheterization, two investigators alternately performed a total of four ultrasound readings on each patient using a hand-held portable instrument, the BVI 2000. The first ultrasound volume determination was comparable to the average ultrasound volume (r2 = 0.956). For catheterized volumes versus the initial ultrasound volume determination, r2 = 0.80. The average error was 18% for catheterized volumes within the range 50-700ml. Our results compare favorably with both real-time scanning using standard equipment and other portable instruments. The noninvasive nature, negligible risks, and reasonable estimates of volume warrant consideration of portable ultrasound scanning for the determination of bladder volumes in SCI patients.\r"

His study of interictal behavior in epilepsy is one of the earliest attempts to avoid selection bias and represents an important contribution to the study of this problem.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical trials first began in 1960 with methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol) administered intrathecally, in an attempt to treat both disk disease and multiple sclerosis. After a few reports of salubrious results, there began an outpouring of contradictory data, which continues in 1988. During this time span, researchers who cautiously tested the different theses of improvement began to publish serious warnings of many complications. For ten years prior to the intraspinal use of methylprednisolone acetate, basic scientists in anesthesiology and neurochemistry had published the following facts: (1) Methylprednisolone acetate's content of polyethylene glycol raises the risks of using it near the central nervous system. (2) Deleterious effects follow the use of glycols when they are placed into or near the neuraxis. (3) Methylprednisolone acetate contains approximately 30 mg of polyethylene glycol per milliliter. (4) When that glycol, which is both alcohol and detergent, is injected intraspinally, sterile meningitis, arachnoiditis, or pachymeningitis will occur. It has also been recognized since the 1960s that the epidural space is not wholly separate from the subdural and/or subarachnoid space. Many thousands of arachnoid villi subtend all the membranes from the intrathecal space, and many of these end in the large epidural veins. Therefore, the various spaces and membranes are not only contiguous, but continuous. It follows that an injection of methylprednisolone acetate into the epidural space does not guarantee that it will remain isolated there. Finally, the inadvertency of injections by the epidural route occurs with the following frequency: 40% of injections can be inadvertently made into interspinous ligaments, and 2.5% into the subarachnoid space.\r"

The adhesive, termed mussel adhesive protein (MAP), is a repeating decapeptide polymer that is the natural adhesive substance produced by the common blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and is used here in conjunction with an enzymatic cross-linking agent. This study marked the first in vivo use of this material in adhering ophthalmic tissue planes. We used a simplified epikeratoplasty technique highlighted by freehand dissection of donor lenticules and host keratotomies. Approximately 10 microL of a combination of MAP and the cross-linking agent was applied directly to the host cornea and the donor lenticules were secured into the keratotomies using eight interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures. All of the sutures were removed 72 hours postoperatively. Eleven of the 15 animals retained their epikeratoplasty lenticules throughout the entire postoperative period. Four animals had initially intact lenticules that sloughed within the first postoperative week; this sloughing, we believe, was attributable to difficulties in tucking irregularly thickened lenticule edges into the keratotomy. In control animals that had lenticules secured with sutures alone, suture removal at 72 hours consistently produced immediate lenticule sloughing. Clinical examinations and histopathologic studies disclosed no untoward effects of the adhesive on the donor or host corneal tissue. We believe that this preliminary study indicates a potential adjunctive role for MAP in epikeratoplasty.\r"

In this study, we found no difference in the corneal graft clarity, thickness, endothelial cell count, or morphologic features of corneal transplants preserved in either M-K or K-Sol media. Storage for more than ten days in either M-K or K-Sol media led to primary graft failure. This study demonstrated equivalent results in corneal preservation using either M-K or K-Sol media. The development of better preservation media may require changes in essential nutrients rather than changes in osmotic constituents.\r"

The viability of the Lieber-De Carli model was, therefore, re-examined. The content of the liquid diet was shown to be nutritionally adequate, when compared to a solid laboratory chow. However, rats on an alcohol feeding regime had sub-optimal growth rates, because of a reduction in the amount of liquid diet consumed. When compared to pair fed controls, rats fed the ethanol-containing diet showed marked changes in skeletal muscle. These observations are similar to those in man and we conclude that the use of the Lieber-De Carli feeding regime in experimental animals is a suitable means of investigating the mechanism of skeletal myopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Five chronic alcoholic patients admitted for detoxification were studied. During the first 24-48 hr of abstinence raised levels of cerebral water (as measured by NMR), vasopressin, renin and supine aldosterone were recorded. Initial vasopressin concentration was correlated (r = 0.88, P less than 0.05) with alcohol consumption in the week prior to admission and was over three times higher in the patients measured after 24-48 hr as compared to less than 24 hr. After one week only supine aldosterone was still raised (P less than 0.05). The results suggest that cerebral oedema occurs during the early stages of abstinence. The role of these changes in the aetiology of withdrawal symptoms, delirium tremens and brain damage remains to be elucidated.\r"

Operative intervention immediately after resuscitation is associated with potentially high morbidity and mortality. Several diagnostic tools are used, including peritoneal lavage and contrast media tests, to accurately diagnose perforated viscus. To avoid an unnecessary celiotomy a clinical treatment protocol has been developed for patients with pneumoperitoneum secondary to CPR. Such diagnostic tools as peritoneal lavage and water-soluble contrast medium test are reviewed and included in this protocol.

The syndrome is characterized by noradrenergic denervation, adrenomedullary failure, but intact baroreflex afferents, cholinergic innervation, and adrenocortical function. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and their degradation products were undetectable in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, whereas dopamine and its degradation products were elevated. Plasma DBH was not detectable. Studies in this novel syndrome showed evidence for the peripheral production of dopamine from sympathetic nerve terminals noradrenergic in nature. Tyrosine hydroxylase is probably induced in this syndrome, since plasma levels of L-DOPA were also elevated. Absence of hemodynamic effects of sympathicolytic agents in the face of an increase in blood pressure after dopamine antagonists suggest that intrasynaptic concentrations of dopamine are in the range of its plasma concentrations. Hypoprolactinemia, reduced REM sleep, increased slow wave sleep and sodium loss, despite low blood pressure, are further evidence for the biological role of dopamine in man.\r"

Acute administration of captopril was associated with a consistent fall in glomerular filtration rate in 5 of 12 patients with BS and 8 of 10 with SK. Overall, glomerular filtration rate decreased by 22 +/- 7%, while mean arterial pressure decreased by only 8 +/- 2% and renal plasma flow remained unaltered. The ACEI-induced change in glomerular filtration rate was unrelated to blood pressure or basal plasma renin activity, but it was inversely related to pre-ACEI filtration fraction. In a comparative study conducted in 6 BS and 4 SK patients, acute administration of nifedipine was associated with a change in glomerular filtration rate of 13 +/- 5% and no change in renal plasma flow, despite a marked decrease in mean arterial pressure of 19 +/- 4%. In contrast, in the same patients, glomerular filtration rate fell by 23 +/- 12%, renal plasma flow did not change and mean arterial pressure fell slightly by 7 +/- 3% after ACEI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the effects of Ca2+ antagonism in vivo, we examined the influence of nifedipine on the Aldo response to Na+ depletion and K+ loading in 11 healthy subjects. On the fifth day of a low-Na+/high-K+ diet (10 mmol Na+/100 mmol K+) the subjects were randomly given either nifedipine 30 mg po or placebo, and on the sixth day they received the alternative drug. KCl in 5% glucose was infused on days 5 and 6 from 10:00 to 12:00 AM (0.6 mmol/kg over 2 hours). Dexamethasone was given to suppress adrenal corticotrophic hormone. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma Aldo were determined every 20 minutes. Nifedipine induced a rise in heart rate at 60 minutes but did not change blood pressure. During KCl/glucose infusions, plasma glucose increased significantly, but plasma K+ remained stable. PRA, but not baseline plasma Aldo, was stimulated by nifedipine. KCl provoked a significant and similar Aldo rise (P less than .01) under placebo and nifedipine. Baseline Aldo/PRA ratio was reduced under nifedipine when compared to placebo (P less than .01), whereas during KCl infusions this ratio was similarly elevated under placebo and nifedipine. We conclude that acute inhibition of slow Ca2+ channels does not interfere with K+-induced Aldo secretion in man, suggesting that adaptive mechanisms operate in vivo.\r"

Whether this condition alters the other major cardiovascular reflex (ie, that originating from receptors in the cardiopulmonary region) is less well known, however. Herein we describe the importance of the inhibitory control of sympathetic vasomotor and renin influences exerted by the cardiopulmonary reflex in normotensive humans as assessed by deactivating and stimulating heart and lung receptors through reductions and increases in central venous pressure respectively obtained via lower-body negative pressure and passive leg raising. Observations on this reflex obtained in experimental animal models are summarized. Finally, we report recent evidence showing that the cardiopulmonary reflex is only slightly affected by mild or moderate essential hypertension but impaired in hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy in a fashion positively related to the degree of this cardiac structural alteration. This may further worsen the severity of hypertension. However, the impairment of the cardiopulmonary reflex is reversible with regression of hypertrophy obtained by antihypertensive treatment which is thus beneficial for cardiovascular homeostasis.\r"

To investigate this issue, the opiate antagonist naloxone was administered to 8 normals and 14 patients with primary aldosteronism, 6 with an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and 8 with IHA. In normals, APA, and IHA, naloxone caused a significant increase in plasma cortisol and no change in ACTH, renin activity (PRA), and aldosterone levels. All subjects were retested after dexamethasone 2 mg. ACTH and cortisol were reduced and PRA was unchanged without modifications after naloxone. Baseline aldosterone was unaltered in all. While normals and APA failed to show any aldosterone response to naloxone under dexamethasone, IHA patients demonstrated a significant decrease. beta-Endorphin concentrations were in the normal range before and after dexamethasone. In normals as well as in APA and IHA, naloxone may act directly on the adrenal cortex increasing zona fasciculata responsiveness to physiological levels of ACTH. The decrease of aldosterone induced by naloxone in IHA under dexamethasone may be due to an intra-adrenal opioid control of zona glomerulosa in this disorder.\r"

The medication regimens consisted of either pinacidil or hydralazine as monotherapy or with propranolol and/or hydrochlorothiazide. Pill counts for the two primary drugs were obtained at each of the 20 return visits. The population was characterized by chronic uncomplicated hypertension and sociodemographic diversity; mean age was 53 years. Despite excellent average weekly pill counts (overall mean compliance rate [+/- SD] = 96.0 +/- 13.2%), we observed large intersubject and intrasubject variance in weekly pill count assessment: individuals' mean standard deviation = 13.7% (range = 0%-86%) and mean coefficient of variation = 0.138 (range = 0.001-0.410). By pill count, 35% of individuals exhibited greater than 110% compliance on at least 1 visit. We conclude that (a) pill count variability is large, even among highly selected subjects, (b) traditional reports of overall pill counts are suboptimal, and (c) pill counts may unreliably measure medication-taking behavior because \"supranormal\" compliance by this method is improbable but common.\r"

In treated hypertension, coronary events cause about 40% of deaths. Although in autopsy serious coronary atherosclerosis is commonly found in hypertension, in severe hypertension, dilated coronary vessels free of atheroma were a common finding. No correlation was noted between the height of blood pressure and degree of coronary atherosclerosis. The relationship between coronary disease and hypertension is consistent with an association between them rather than hypertension being a causal factor. The factors that cause acute myocardial infarction may differ from those which predispose to coronary atherosclerosis.\r"

This suggests that low uptake of the test is not a result of patients' resistance, and the results indicated that the provision of early information about the test is likely to improve uptake and decrease anxiety. With the increasing clinical usefulness of the AFP test, routine screening of pregnant women with an 'opt-out' system is becoming clinically desirable, and the survey suggests that it would be acceptable to the patients.\r"

The blood flow through the arterial valves was added to estimate combined cardiac output. Normal ranges for values in all sites were established in our own series, and were similar to other published results. Abnormality of the waveform in the umbilical artery proved the most useful predictor of perinatal morbidity. Reversal of the normal pattern of increasing diastolic flow in the umbilical artery with advancing gestation was an important prognostic finding in the pregnancies studied serially. The combined cardiac output did not fall until late in the course of fetal compromise, and low values were seen only with an abnormal umbilical artery tracing.\r"

The indices were calculated from 133 last trimester recordings using an objective and very reliable computer analysis technique. The PI is more difficult to calculate than the other two quantities and the extra computation does not provide any extra information. The A/B ratio appears the simplest index to use but the values are not normally distributed. With the PR a normal distribution of values can be assumed. A theoretical consideration of errors showed that none of the indices is intrinsically less error prone for last trimester waveforms overall. The errors in the A/B ratio increase as the value of the index increase, whereas the converse holds for the PI and PR.\r"

In concept this form of regulation is analogous to the manner by which RBC production is controlled to maintain the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. The platelet mass appears to correlate more closely with platelet function than the platelet count alone, since several factors in addition to the platelet count have been shown to influence the platelets' hemostatic function. These factors include platelet size, density, age, and previous hemostatic interactions. Application of these concepts to clinical problems has provided important insights into platelet physiology and reactivity. Failure to account for differences in platelet heterogeneity among individuals may introduce significant errors in the interpretation of data from laboratory and clinical investigations. However, despite advances, a number of practical issues remain to be resolved before measurements of platelet heterogeneity become accepted as routine clinical tests and are used in the diagnosis of pathologic states.\r"

To assess the toxicity and biological activity of recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) in vivo, 25 patients with malignancy or bone marrow failure were treated with rhGM-CSF (specific activity approximately 5 x 10(7) U/mg) as part of a phase 1 trial. The treatment was administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion daily for 2 weeks at fixed dose levels and repeated after a 2-week rest period. Over the entire dose range tested (15 to 500 micrograms/m2/d), rhGM-CSF treatment was associated with dramatic increases (two- to 70-fold) in total leukocyte counts, which consisted predominantly of neutrophils, bands, eosinophils, and monocytes. Furthermore, six of the 14 patients with one or more cytopenias that received at least two cycles of treatment had multilineage responses characterized by twofold or greater increases in platelet count to a level above 100,000, twofold or greater increases in corrected reticulocyte count, and a reduced requirement for red cell transfusions. Three of these patients became independent of both red cell and platelet transfusions for 17 to 37 weeks of follow-up. Treatment was associated also with an increase in bone marrow cellularity and frequency of cycling progenitor cells. The treatment was well tolerated; side effects included constitutional symptoms and bone pain. These results demonstrated that rhGM-CSF has a significant impact on hematopoiesis in patients with advanced malignancy and also in patients with bone marrow failure.\r"

TGF beta induced a dose-dependent inhibition of blast clonogenic cells in suspension and methylcellulose cultures in the presence of optimal concentrations of stimulators provided by conditioned media from the bladder cell line HTB9 (HTB9-CM) or the recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). On removal of TGF beta, blast clonogenic cell proliferation recovers to the same level as that observed in control cultures, indicating that the effect is reversible. There was no induction of cell differentiation, as indicated by morphological and functional studies (production of superoxyde anions). Cell cycle analysis by thymidine uptake and flow cytometry with a DNA binding dye indicated that TGF beta caused a delay in progression into S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle without affecting cell viability. Thus, TGF beta appears to have a cytostatic rather than cytolytic effect on blast precursors and might therefore play a role as a negative regulator in hematopoiesis.\r"

We studied the effects of synthetic peptides occurring in milk proteins (bovine K-casein, KNQDK, and human lactotransferrin, KRDS) and in fibrinogen (RGDS and L10) on subsequent binding of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against the glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex (AP2 and P2) on adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-stimulated and unstimulated human platelets and megakaryocytes (MKs) by using an immunoperoxidase method to visualize antibody binding. Only KRDS (900 mumol/L) inhibited the binding of AP2 and P2 on ADP (5 mumol/L)-stimulated platelets, but not on unstimulated platelets. However, the binding of P2 was considerably more inhibited than that of AP2 as judged by immunoperoxidase intensity. Radiolabeled AP2 binding was inhibited by 30% with KRDS on ADP-stimulated platelets as compared with platelets incubated in the absence of ADP. KRDS did not inhibit the binding of MoAbs against GP IIIa (SZ 21), GP IIb (SZ 22), and GP Ib (SZ 2) on ADP-stimulated human platelets. Inhibition of P2 binding by KRDS was also observed in a section of MKs isolated from human bone marrow and stimulated by 15 or 20 micron ADP. A lower concentration of ADP (5 or 10 mumol/L) failed to produce any inhibition of binding. This indicates that MKs may not be equally responsive to agonists as platelets. Moreover, P2 binding inhibition was observed in a larger (P less than .001) percentage of mature MKs (29%) as compared with younger, maturing MKs (11%). The observations suggested that a functional ability possessed by platelets, namely, agonist-induced exposure of the site of interaction of KRDS, may occur at a late stage of MK development.\r"

  ".W": "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has previously been shown to stimulate granulocyte, macrophage, and megakaryocyte lineages to act as an erythroid burst-promoting activity and to stimulate limited replication of spleen colony-forming cells. Here we demonstrate that murine GM-CSF alone or in combination with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) can stimulate colony-forming cells in bone marrow (BM) that have a high proliferative capacity. In cultures of BM from mice treated with 5-fluorouracil (FU) eight days before sampling, GM-CSF alone or in combination with CSF-1 stimulated the formation of large macrophage colonies with diameters greater than 0.5 mm. CSF-1 alone, at 800 units or greater, also stimulated larger colonies; however, these colonies were always less than 1.1 mm in diameter, whereas GM-CSF in combination with CSF-1 stimulated many colonies with diameters between 1 and 4 mm. At all doses of CSF-1 tested, the combination of factors resulted in a synergistic increase in colonies with diameters greater than 1.0 or 2.0 mm. Analysis of the incidence of colony-forming cells in the BM of normal mice and mice 2, 4, 6, and 8 days after FU treatment demonstrated that the progenitor cells stimulated by GM-CSF alone or in combination with CSF-1 were depleted by FU treatment in vivo and regenerated more rapidly than did the macrophage progenitors (M-CFC) stimulated by CSF-1 alone. This is similar to the properties of the previously described high-proliferative potential, colony-forming cell (HPP-CFC) that is responsive to interleukin-3 plus CSF-1 but not the HPP-CFC stimulated by hematopoietin 1 plus CSF-1. These data suggest that GM-CSF plus CSF-1 act synergistically to stimulate a population of progenitor cells that have a high proliferative potential and have properties similar to those of the population of HPP-CFC stimulated by interleukin-3 plus CSF-1.\r"

  ".U": "88269819\r", 
  ".W": "Mammalian plasma contains a high-affinity actin-binding protein, plasma gelsolin, that severs actin filaments. Destruction of erythrocytes could result in the release of erythrocyte cytoskeletal actin into the plasma where it could bind to gelsolin. If the clearance of actin-gelsolin complexes exceeds its synthesis, lowering of the plasma gelsolin concentration might follow. To test this hypothesis, we measured plasma gelsolin levels in patients with falciparum malaria, a disease where at least part of the hemolysis takes place in the intravascular space and that is usually not accompanied by dysfunction of other organs. Two functional gelsolin assays showed that the mean plasma gelsolin concentration of 18 Nigerian children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria was less than 50% (P less than .001) of healthy Nigerian control subjects tested at the same time. Patients with pneumonia and febrile seizures also had depressed gelsolin levels, which indicates that factors other than hemolysis can lower gelsolin concentrations. Gelsolin levels were measured in 11 patients from The Gambia with P falciparum malaria before and approximately 3 weeks after treatment. In all cases the gelsolin level increased after treatment. To confirm the hypothesis that hemolysis can result in a lowering of plasma gelsolin levels, hemolysis was induced in rabbits, either acutely (by the injection of human serum) or subacutely (by the administration of phenylhydrazine). A fall in plasma gelsolin levels was seen, the rate of fall differing with the extent of hemolysis. Affinity adsorption of plasma from animals undergoing acute hemolysis with Sepharose beads coupled to the actin-binding protein DNase I, followed by immunoblotting of adherent proteins with antiactin antiserum demonstrated the presence of actin in circulating rabbit plasma. These studies suggest that under some conditions components of the red cell cytoskeleton are exposed to plasma proteins and that accelerated clearance of actin-gelsolin complexes may explain in part the depressed plasma gelsolin levels seen in patients with falciparum malaria.\r"

This study addressed the independent prognostic values of these and other variables, including plasma cell labeling indices (LI), in patients with newly diagnosed MM. beta 2M levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. LI were determined with a [3H]thymidine autoradiography method. By multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the uncorrected beta 2M level remained the most significant prognostic factor after adjustment for age. Stage and creatinine level were closely related to beta 2M level and were no longer predictive of outcome after adjustment for age and beta 2M. Plasma cell LI varied independently of beta 2M level and remained predictive. A subset of patients with plasma-blastic myeloma had poor survival since beta 2M level and plasma cell LI were high. By using beta 2M level and LI, three risk groups were defined: low (beta 2M less than 4 micrograms/mL and LI less than 0.4%, median survival 48 months); intermediate (beta 2M less than 4 micrograms/mL and LI greater than or equal to 0.4%, median survival 29 months); and high (beta 2M greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/mL, median survival 12 months). Such grouping may better identify MM patients who might benefit from new treatment regimens.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (Ep), granulocyte/macrophage (GM) and granulocyte (G) colony-stimulating factors (CSF), and interleukin-3 (IL-3) on erythroid burst and GM colony growth have been studied in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-supplemented and FBS-deprived culture. Sources of progenitor cells were nonadherent or nonadherent T-lymphocyte-depleted marrow or peripheral blood cells from normal humans. G-CSF, in concentrations up to 2.3 X 10(-10) mol/L, induced only the formation of neutrophil colonies. In contrast, GM-CSF and IL-3 both induced GM colonies and sustained the formation of erythroid bursts in the presence of Ep. However, the activities of these growth factors were affected by the culture conditions. IL-3 induction of GM colonies depended on the presence of FBS, whereas the degree of GM-CSF induction of GM colonies in FBS-deprived cultures depended on the method by which adherent cells were removed. GM-CSF increased colony numbers in a concentration-dependent manner only if the cells had been prepared by overnight adherence. Both GM-CSF and IL-3 exhibited erythroid burst-promoting activity in FBS-deprived cultures. However, some lineage restriction was evident because GM-CSF was two- to threefold more active than IL-3 in inducing GM colonies but IL-3 was two- to threefold more active in promoting erythroid burst growth. Furthermore, in FBS-deprived cultures, the number of both erythroid bursts and GM colonies reached the maximum only when Ep, GM-CSF, and IL-3 or GM-CSF, IL-3, and G-CSF, respectively, were added together. These results suggest that the colonies induced by IL-3, GM-CSF, and G-CSF are derived from different progenitors.\r"

The cases were first evaluated for expression of HLA-DR, CD19, CD34, CD10, CD20, and CD22 by indirect one-color immunofluorescence. Pairwise comparisons of cell surface marker expression were performed for each leukemic sample: no correlations were observed for paired antigen expression on the leukemic samples using antigens expressed either early or late during normal B lymphoid development. Complete immunophenotypes of the cases were then compared with normal B-cell developmental stages. Sixteen different complete immunophenotypes were observed on the leukemias that were not found in normal marrow; at least 78% of the cases demonstrated such \"asynchronous\" combinations of B lymphoid-associated differentiation antigens. Several samples were subsequently studied by two-color immunofluorescence, and the presence of doubly labeled cells with \"asynchronous\" antigen combinations was confirmed. These results indicate that the majority of B lineage leukemias exhibit \"developmental asynchrony,\" as compared with normal marrow B cells. The data further suggest that ALL cases do not accurately represent cells arrested at the stage where the leukemogenic event occurred. Rather, ALL appears to be a disease in which there may be maturation of leukemic blasts; but this maturation is \"asynchronous\" when compared with the normal developmental process.\r"

Different configurations of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements and fused EBV genomic termini were frequently observed in tissues from different biopsy sites in individual patients, confirming the multiclonal origins for these lymphomas. In rare specimens, multiple forms of the joined termini were detected within individual lesions, which appeared polymorphous by histologic methods of analysis and polyclonal by immunologic and immunogenetic methods of analysis. These studies confirm that there is a spectrum of EBV-associated disorders of varying clonal composition that may arise in immunosuppressed organ-allograft recipients. The data are consistent with the proposal that the lymphoproliferations initiate as polyclonal expansions of EBV-carrying B cells, which progress to multiclonal lymphomas in most patients. Detection of homogeneous episomal EBV DNA in most lesions supports a primary role for the virus in the pathogenesis of these disorders.\r"

  ".W": "The appearance of widespread multiple drug resistance in human malaria has intensified the search for new antimalarial compounds. Metal chelators, especially those with high affinity for iron, represent one presently unexploited class of antimalarials. Unfortunately the use of previously identified chelators as antimalarials has been precluded by their toxicity and, in the case of desferrioxamine, the necessity for parenteral administration. The investigators now report that a new class of orally active iron chelators, namely the derivatives of alpha-ketohydroxypyridines (KHPs), are potent antimalarials against cultured Plasmodium falciparum. The KHPs evidently exert this effect by sequestering iron because a preformed chelator:iron complex has no antimalarial action. The pool(s) of iron being sequestered by the chelators have not been identified but may not include serum transferrin. Preincubation of human serum with KHPs followed by removal of the drug results in the removal of greater than 97% of total serum iron. Nonetheless, this serum effectively supports the growth of P falciparum cultures. Therefore the KHPs may exert antimalarial effect through chelation of erythrocytic rather than serum iron pool(s). The investigators conclude that these powerful, orally active iron chelators may form the basis of a new class of antimalarial drugs.\r"

  ".U": "88269851\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of differentiation induction by a tumor-promoting phorbol diester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on a clonal human megakaryoblastic cell line, MEG-O1s, was investigated, and a prominent response was demonstrated. The cells became weakly adherent, developed conspicuous cytoplasmic blebs, and displayed mature megakaryocytic characteristics by light microscopy such as the development of azurophilic cytoplasmic granules and a mosaic pattern of oxyphilic patches, multiplication of nuclei, and enhancement of the PAS reaction and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase staining. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated the development of prominent cytoplasmic blebs, budding of blebs, and multiplication of nuclei. Numerous granules with central nucleoids that are similar to alpha granules had developed as well as granules with high electron density and clearly demarcated zones. Surface marker analysis revealed a moderate increase in IgG Fc receptor levels and a profound decrease in C3 receptor sites. By an immunofluorescent technique using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, a dramatic change in the expression of several megakaryocyte-platelet-specific proteins was demonstrated. All the proteins that had been expressed before induction such as platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, factor XIIIA, beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), and HLA class 1 antigen were profoundly enhanced after induction by TPA. Induction by TPA led to the expression of fibronectin and factor V, which were not detected on nontreated cells. An ultrastructural immunoperoxidase study demonstrated platelet GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa in both plasma membranes and protein synthesis areas such as perinuclear cisternae and endoplasmic reticulum after TPA induction. beta-TG was also observed in some cytoplasmic granules of TPA-treated cells. TPA remarkably increased the secretion of beta-TG into the culture medium of MEG-01s. Ploidy was also increased from 2C to 4C to 4C to 8C. Similar maturation of MEG-01s was induced by other phorbol diester analogues such as phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, but not by phorbol itself. These results indicate that phorbol diester, TPA, can bring about differentiation and maturation of a human megakaryoblastic cell line (MEG-01s) and that MEG-01s cells will provide a useful model for studying megakaryocytic differentiation and numerous megakaryocyte-platelet-specific proteins.\r"

HL60 cells previously grown in serum-free medium containing microgram quantities of insulin showed an 18-fold reduction in cumulative cell production when grown without insulin. However, the same cells showed reduced or absent growth stimulation with 1 to 100 ng/mL insulin or IGF-I for at least four days following insulin deprivation, indicating that culture conditions modified insulin and IGF-I responses. When the same cells were grown in Fe-supplemented, protein-free medium (RPMI-Fe), insulin and IGF-I caused dose-dependent stimulation of HL60 cell growth with half-maximal stimulation at nanogram concentrations. Namalwa cells grown in protein-free medium showed no response to either hormone. Radioligand binding showed the presence of insulin and IGF-I receptors on both HL60 and Namalwa cells grown in RPMI-Fe. HL60 cells grown in fetal bovine serum had higher, and cells grown with microgram quantities of insulin dramatically reduced, insulin binding. Competitive binding studies and cultures with anti-IGF-I receptor antibody showed insulin and IGF-I stimulated growth through their respective specific receptors. Both insulin and IGF-I stimulate growth of some cultured human leukemia cells, but the presence of insulin or IGF-I receptors alone does not predict growth responses. Culture conditions affect both cellular responses and ligand binding by these hormones and must be closely controlled to study growth responses.\r"

Donor or host mitoses were identified by examination of sex chromosomes in 32 patients or by evaluation of the polymorphism of other chromosomes after specific banding in six patients. Twenty-four patients were recipients of untreated BMT, and 14 were recipients of T-cell-depleted BMT. In the 24 patients who received untreated BMT, all showed successful engraftment, and only three had a transient mixed chimera. In the 14 recipients of T-cell-depleted BMTs, four rejected their grafts, and seven had mixed chimeras; these mixed chimeras were more frequent in blood lymphocytes than in marrow cells and could be detected up to 26 months after BMT. This high frequency of partial chimerism after T-cell-depleted BMT by comparison with a control group suggests that the donor's T cells play an important role in the eradication of host residual hematopoiesis after allogeneic BMT.\r"

Clonal ancestors of the lymphoma cells were identified by this marker among bone marrow pre-B cells (5% to 26%). A second antiidiotype (anti-Id) antibody specific for the complete lymphoma IgM kappa recognized 10% of B cells in bone marrow and blood and greater than 95% of B cells in lymphomatous lymph nodes, including one obtained after tumor conversion to a diffuse large cell lymphoma. Immunoglobulin gene analysis surprisingly revealed expansion of multiple clones of early B lineage cells in bone marrow, including members of the neoplastic clone. The data suggest that this lymphoma arose through a progression of transformational events beginning in bone marrow: first, creation of an oligoclonal pre-neoplastic pool of pre-B cells, subsequent conversion of a single subclone into low grade neoplastic B cells that homed to the lymph node follicles, and later progression to a more invasive form of the B-cell lymphoma.\r"

No patient with distant metastases or unresectable disease entered the study. The two treatment groups were comparable with regard to patient characteristics. Pre- and postoperative complications (including mortality within 30 days) were similar in both groups. After a complete follow-up of 5 years, a tendency for reduction in the number of, and time to, occurrences of liver metastases was seen in the no-touch isolation group (P = 0.14). This effect was most obvious in the sigmoid colon with angio-invasive growth. Overall (P = 0.42) and corrected (P = 0.25) survival did not differ significantly among the treatment groups although in every analysis the survival data of the no-touch isolation group were superior. The data do suggest a limited benefit of the no-touch isolation technique. This observation is important since the morbidity and mortality of surgery were equal in both groups.\r"

Prospective studies of cerebral complications from this technique, published over the last decade, have been analysed to show that the major stroke rate after conventional cerebral angiography for patients with TIAs is likely to be about 2.4 per cent. This must be taken into account if the true morbidity of carotid endarterectomy is to be appreciated (assuming conventional angiograms have been used). Furthermore, since many sufferers are assessed by angiography but not submitted to surgery, a policy of conventional angiography for patients with TIAs puts a far greater number at risk than that actually having carotid endarterectomy.\r"

SI patients also had a lower incidence of pulmonary or abdominal complications but the difference was not significant. Finally, we found a reduced hospital stay for the SI patients (P less than 0.01), probably related to a reduced postoperative analgesic requirement and an improved pulmonary function. We conclude that subcostal incision is a better approach for biliary tract surgery and should be used whenever possible.\r"

At present the exact mechanisms responsible for the onset of this complication are not well known. In order to elucidate some of these mechanisms, 20 patients with severe burns were studied for 1 year in an attempt to assess the prevailing glomerular or tubular localization of renal damage; the organic or functional pattern of renal damage and the reliability and possible prognostic significance of some renal function indices. These included the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa), the alpha-glucosidases, the leucine aminopeptidases (LAP) and the serum and urine beta 2-microglobulin. The incidence of ARF in the patients studied was 26 per cent and in all cases it was of polyuric type. We believe that renal damage very often remains undetected when the traditional testing methods are used and that only in some patients does it become severe enough to result in ARF. In contrast, some of the tests considered in our study are extremely useful and reveal an impairment of renal function long before it becomes clinically apparent.\r"

In intermingled skin transplants, however, the autogenic epidermis directly covers the allodermis, which results in a definitively covered wound with a mostly normal skin texture. It seems that during the first phase after the burn the allodermis is accepted as donor skin. In the second phase it becomes covered by the epidermis and surrounded by the connective tissue of the recipient. During this process all structures of ectodermal origin like skin adnexa are rejected. Since for the most part the elastic fibres in the allograft remain unchanged after a successful intermingled skin transplantation, the transplant shows elasticity similar to a mesh autograft, but it is incapable of regenerating skin adnexa. After complete healing cellular and humoral infiltrates, as in the case of immunological rejections, could no longer be detected.\r"

The patients were treated in all but one case by release of the contracture band with placement of a skin graft in the resulting defect. There was an overall recurrence rate of 15 per cent that was not affected by the use of split-thickness versus full-thickness grafts. The time delay from the thermal injury to the reconstructive procedure was also found not to affect the outcome. Postoperative immobilization by the use of either a dynamic or an adynamic splint was found to be important both for preventing graft loss and for decreasing the rate of contracture recurrence.\r"

There are three clinical patterns of hemorrhagic disease: early HDNB (usually related to maternal drug ingestion), classic HDNB (related to breast-feeding) and late hemorrhagic disease of infancy (related to the combination of breast-feeding and diseases that cause fat malabsorption). Despite the knowledge that the disease can virtually be prevented by the administration of vitamin K, not all newborns are being routinely considered for such treatment. The Canadian Paediatric Society has made several recommendations: (a) women who take drugs that interfere with vitamin K1 metabolism should receive oral doses of vitamin K1 daily for a minimum of 2 weeks before expected delivery; (b) all healthy term infants should receive a single dose of vitamin K1, orally or intramuscularly, within 6 hours after birth; (c) all other newborns, including preterm, low-birthweight and sick infants, should receive a single intramuscular dose of vitamin K1 within 6 hours after birth; and (d) infants at high risk for secondary late-onset hemorrhagic disease due to fat malabsorption should receive vitamin K1 orally every day or intramuscularly once a month.\r"

We, then, used AT II in conjunction with intraarterial infusion chemotherapy (IAC) for locally advanced breast cancer in order to increase drug delivery to the tumor and enhance its anticancer effect. Eleven patients (from 1976-1981) received IAC with doxorubicin through the internal thoracic and subclavian arteries, alternately, for 10 days (AT II- group). Twenty-four patients (from 1981-1985) received IAC with doxorubicin and concomitant infusion of AT II (1.3 micrograms/min through the internal thoracic artery and 2.6 micrograms/min through the subclavian artery) (AT II+ group). The response rate of the primary breast tumor was higher in the AT II+ group (92%) than in the AT II- group (73%) (P = 0.66). Complete tumor necrosis was 46% in the AT II+ group, but only 27% in the AT II- group (P = 0.51). These preliminary results suggest that the anticancer effect of IAC for breast cancer can be enhanced with concomitant infusion of AT II.\r"

The median survival rate of the Adriamycin group was 10.6 weeks; that of the group receiving no antitumor therapy was 7.5 weeks (P = 0.036). Adriamycin induced tumor regression of 25% to 50% in 5% of patients and of over 50% in only 3.3% of patients. It caused fatal complications (septicemia and cardiotoxicity) in 25% of patients. The severity of neutropenia leading to septicemia for a particular dose was unpredictable. Four of eight patients who developed cardiotoxicity received less than 500 mg/m2 of Adriamycin. We conclude that Adriamycin is not an ideal drug for the treatment of inoperable HCC.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies showed that both the pineal gland and the endogenous opioid system are involved in the modulation of the immune system and in the regulation of tumor growth. Moreover, a relationship between pineal and opioid system has been demonstrated. In order get an overall view of the psychoneuroendocrine interactions in cancer patients, the levels of melatonin, the most important pineal hormone, and of beta-endorphin have been measured on blood samples collected during the morning. The study was carried out on 54 patients, 42 healthy subjects, and in 34 patients having illnesses other than cancer. Breast cancer, lung carcinoma, and colorectum cancer were the three neoplasms detected in the patients investigated. Growth hormone (GH), somatomedin-C and prolactin (PRL) levels were also determined. beta-endorphin levels were found to be substantially within the normal range in patients with cancer, whereas those of melatonin were raised in several cases. The beta-endorphin/melatonin ratio was higher than 2 in normal subjects, in non-neoplastic patients and in most cancer patients without metastases, whereas this ratio was lower than 2 in almost all patients in a metastatic stage of the disease. Neither melatonin levels nor those of beta-endorphin appeared to be significantly correlated with GH, somatomedin-C, and PRL concentrations. The low beta-endorphin/melatonin ratio observed in metastatic patients suggests the presence of an unbalanced relation between the pineal and the opioid system in those subjects. Therefore, an anomalous relationship between pineal function and opioid activity might play a role in the clinical course of neoplastic disease.\r"

Our objective was to determine if these factors could serve as prognostic indicators. Forty patients died of recurrence or metastases within 2 years (Group I), and the remaining 45 survived 10 years or longer (Group II) after resection. CEA-positive cells were present in 93% and 89% of Groups I and II, respectively. In case of staining for CEA, positive results were seen not only in the malignant cells but also in the stroma in 35% of Group I but none in Group II. The immunohistochemical status of SC was not essentially different between Groups I and II; the positive staining was recognized in 50% and in 57%, respectively. Gastric carcinomas rarely reacted to AFP. S-100 protein-positive cells, which play an important role in local immunity, were often present in Group II (47%) but rarely in Group I (10%). Thus, in addition to the various prognostic factors available to the surgical pathologist, the presence of CEA and the appearance of S-100 protein-positive cells in tumor tissue will aid in predicting the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric carcinoma.\r"

The survival rate was 51% at 3 years. Patients with elevated seric levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and/or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), or the presence of an abdominal mass had significantly worse survival. Only HCG and AFP levels retained their significance when multivariate Cox analysis was performed. The probability that a patient achieves a complete remission (CR) was assessed by a function of certain patient characteristics using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The significant variables were a function of HCG and AFP values. Since both variables are related to the CR rate and survival the authors define the obtention of a CR as a unique outcome of interest. The probability of a CR greater than 70% adequately separates the patients into two prognostic subgroups. This model currently is being used to enrole NSGCT patients in a prospective modulated clinical trial according to these prognostic factors.\r"

The patients presented with splenomegaly, cytopenias, and no peripheral lymphadenopathy. The gross appearance of the spleens was beefy red without tumor nodules. The tumor cells were primarily in the splenic cords and surrounding residual normal white pulp. There was a minimal hemic phase. The tumor cells had abundant cytoplasm, surface IgM, IgD, kappa, and FC receptors, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, but no alkaline phosphatase or interleukin-2 receptors. They had a similar DNA aneuploidy. The most unusual feature was that tumor cells in both cases had phagocytic properties. These lymphomas may be clinically more indolent than their follicular center counterparts.\r"

The tumors were bulky and arose within, or in close proximity to, the uterus. One tumor involved the endometrial cavity and myometrium extensively, another was attached to the anterior uterine serosa, another was in the cul-de-sac, and one lay between the lower uterine segment and urinary bladder. The ovaries were grossly unremarkable in all cases. Peritoneal metastases were present at the time of operation in two patients and were documented on histologic examination in a third. The serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated postoperatively in the three patients in whom it was determined. Three of the YST were pure and had a typical histologic appearance, whereas the fourth had an endometrioid-like glandular pattern and was associated with a teratoma. Immunohistochemical stains performed in three cases all showed AFP and alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT). All patients received postoperative combination chemotherapy. Two of them died of tumor 14 and 24 months, respectively, postoperatively and two were disease-free 6 and 8.5 years, respectively, postoperatively.\r"

At the first screening 9,040 (66%) completed the test, and 7,770 (58%) completed the test at the second screening. In the first screening the test group was divided into two subgroups in which the tests were rehydrated and unhydrated before development. All tests were rehydrated in the second screening; 1.9% and 5.8% of the tests were positive in the unhydrated and rehydrated subgroups, respectively. The number of diagnosed neoplasms in the first screening was significantly larger (P less than 0.01) in the rehydrated group compared to the unhydrated group, 50 and 24 neoplasms, respectively. Sixteen of 61 carcinomas in the test group were found in the interval between the two screenings, 19 of the carcinomas at the second screening, and ten among the nonresponders. Rehydration of the Hemoccult II test is a necessity. Significantly more carcinomas (61) were found in the test group compared to the control group (20). There was a trend toward favorable tumor staging in the test group compared to the control group.\r"

  ".W": "Elite tennis players, as well as a large number of active recreational players, are involved in a sport that applies high repetitive loads that can create tension overload situations in certain key anatomic areas of the body and add to possible overload situations in other areas of the body. This results in patterns of inflexibility and weakness that can be demonstrated on a tennis-specific musculoskeletal exam, and that can be correlated with areas of increased injury occurrence. These players report conditioning programs that are, for the most part, inadequate to confer total conditioning of all the muscular parameters important in playing tennis. All of these factors, in addition to the frequency and type of playing, contribute to the occurrence of the overload injuries noted. These aspects need to be addressed in a preventative program for injury reduction. We do not believe that major changes in the way that tennis is played should be implemented until the effects of a proper preventative conditioning program are evaluated. The \"ideal\" conditioning program has not yet been found. While the exact composition of the program is in doubt, our studies allow us to recommend flexibility, strength, and endurance training for all athletes playing tennis at frequent intervals. This program should be guided by the findings on the preparticipation exam.\r"

Treatment with potassium and spironolactone alleviated his signs and symptoms and normalized the blood pressure and CPK. Initial studies revealed low plasma renin activity that did not increase with change from supine to upright position. Plasma aldosterone was consistently elevated in the supine position, decreased with upright posture, and was not suppressed by administration of dexamethasone. Plasma 18-hydroxycorticosterone also was elevated. Enhanced computerized tomography (CT) revealed a mass in the left adrenal that had not been seen on the initial unenhanced scan. Adrenal vein catheterization confirmed elevated plasma aldosterone on that side. Adrenalectomy was performed, and a well-encapsulated adenoma was found at examination of the surgical specimen. Postoperatively, suppression of plasma renin activity continued for many months without signs of aldosterone deficiency.\r"

Pinacidil (12.5 to 75 mg b.i.d.) was a more potent vasodilator, producing a mean decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (baseline = 102 to 103 +/- 9 mm Hg) of 18.8 +/- 10.0 (SD) mm Hg compared with 15.5 +/- 9.2 mm Hg with prazosin (1 to 10 mg b.i.d.; p less than 0.001). Patients responding to each drug had similar average blood pressure levels during 12-hour monitoring (137/85 mm Hg). More patients taking pinacidil required hydrochlorothiazide for edema (p = 0.008) and more taking prazosin required hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol for lack of efficacy (p less than 0.001). Tachycardia (15% to 20%) and palpitation (13% to 15%) were frequent events with both drugs. Edema (38.2% vs 22.3%) was more frequent with pinacidil (p less than 0.001) and postural hypotension (4.7% vs 1.0%) and asthenia (20.2% vs 13.2%) were more frequent with prazosin (p = 0.025; 0.062). No significant laboratory toxicity was noted. In conclusion, both pinacidil and prazosin are effective as monotherapy for hypertension. Monotherapy with pinacidil is limited by adverse events related to vasodilatation and monotherapy with prazosin is limited by lack of efficacy.\r"

No significant difference between the groups was noted in terms of demographic characteristics, creatinine clearance, or vancomycin serum concentrations. However, the difference in daily dose needed to maintain the specified serum concentrations was significantly greater for burn patients (p less than 0.02). Burn patients also had to be dosed significantly more often than medical/surgical patients to achieve peak and trough vancomycin serum concentrations within the desired range (p less than 0.02). The elimination half-life in burn patients was significantly shorter than that in control patients (p less than 0.001). Because of the unusually high dosage requirements in burn patients, along with their poor predictability, individualization of therapy with vancomycin serum concentrations is recommended to ensure a successful therapeutic outcome.\r"

Early, careful examinations and informed patients can aid in early diagnosis. Carcinoma in situ, verified by biopsy, is best treated with wide local excision. Invasive vulvar carcinoma should be treated with radical vulvectomy and bilateral groin node dissection. The major source of morbidity is wound breakdown. The use of modified incision techniques and sartorius muscle transplantation have significantly decreased these postoperative complications. The clinical staging system for vulvar carcinoma is approved by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). The disease usually spreads systematically from the vulva to superficial groin nodes, to deep groin nodes, and then to pelvic nodes. Survival rates of 84% for stage I disease can be achieved. Evidence of positive groin nodes indicates a poor prognosis. However, even patients with advanced disease can be surgically cured by radical surgery. Five of ten patients (50%) with stage IV disease were alive and free of disease at five years with exenterative surgery. Any patient who is a reasonable medical risk, with a vulvar lesion that is resectable, should be treated surgically. Otherwise, the patients not only die, but they die in abject misery.\r"

Much of the early clinical work involved treatment of patients with advanced, recurrent disease who had not responded to conventional therapy. Because good responses with acceptable toxicity have been obtained in these patients, active investigation continued and is aimed at defining the most appropriate sites and applications for the technique. Because of the limited depth of light penetration in tissue, the most promising sites may be those where there is limited thickness of tumor, such as in superficial skin lesions or carcinomas in situ involving the aerodigestive tract, bronchial tree, or genitourinary tract. Other potential uses include those where PDT could be combined with surgical or chemotherapeutic debulking, such as pleural mesothelioma or advanced stage ovarian cancer. Whether PDT can be of benefit in surgical cases where the margins of resection are close is an interesting but speculative notion at the present time. Clinical trials with hematoporphyrin derivative PDT in the sites mentioned are in progress. Laboratory work to better understand HpD also continues, as well as investigations into alternative photosensitizers with improved tumor localization, less cutaneous photosensitivity, and absorption peaks at deeper penetrating wavelengths of light. Attempts at measuring singlet oxygen, if successful, will permit the development of more meaningful dosimetry in order to correlate response with actual tissue levels of the purported cytotoxic agent. Hopefully, these and other developments in the field of PDT will improve the treatment for patients with cancer.\r"

  ".W": "From the time of Hippocrates until the late 19th century, physicians and surgeons were convinced that surgical attempts at treating colorectal cancers were doomed to failure. This opinion stemmed from prevailing views on carcinogenesis. The three dominant theories, the humoral, mineral, and lymph theories, held that all cancers developed in tissue that had a diseased disposition. Thus, excision of the gross tumor mass alone seemed unlikely to cure the patient. Consequently, surgical treatment of all cancers, and in particular colorectal cancer, was vehemently condemned. The 19th century represented a transition period. Advances in surgical technique made excision of rectal cancers feasible. Unfortunately, classical views that resection of cancer was futile delayed the development of surgical treatment for colorectal cancer. Indeed, it was not until the late 19th century that a few individuals ignored these tenets of classical medicine and attempted local resections of rectal cancers. By the second quarter of the 20th century, a radical change occurred in the prevailing theories of carcinogenesis. Wide acceptance of the unicellular origin of cancer and the mucosal origin of colorectal cancers washed away admonitions against surgical treatment of colorectal cancers. It became axiomatic that all cancers, including colorectal cancers, could be cured surgically if treated while still local diseases.\r"

Colonic ischemia was produced by devascularization of the marginal vessels in the left colon and graded into three degrees by measuring colonic blood flow with a hydrogen gas clearance method. The agent was administered intravenously after devascularization using a continuous infusion pump. The parameters studied were colonic blood flow in the submucosal layer, rate of anastomotic leakage, beta-glucuronidase activity and protein content of the colonic mucosa, and histologic changes. After administration of the agent, blood flow increased significantly and beta-glucuronidase activity at the anastomotic site was well preserved at a relatively high level in spite of ischemic change. The anastomotic leakage rate was significantly decreased. The present study proved that administration of this new prostacyclin analogue minimizes ischemic damage, and may be of considerable importance in ischemic colonic anastomoses.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of inhibition of disaccharidases on the degree of absorption of glucose, lactose, and sucrose was examined utilizing an in vivo model in the rat. Acarbose, a competitive alpha-glucosidase inhibitor was utilized to selectively inhibit small intestinal mucosal enzymes. Adult rats (250-350 g body weight) were the subjects of intraduodenal bolus infusion experiments with either sugar alone or sugar plus acarbose. All sugars were infused at a dose of 0.5 g/kg body weight. Portal venous blood glucose was determined at 30-min intervals from 0 to 150 min. Glucose (monosaccharide) and lactose (beta-galactoside) absorption were not altered by the presence of acarbose. In contrast, sucrose (alpha-glucosidase) absorption was significantly diminished in the presence of acarbose. Sucrose absorption in the presence of increasing acarbose doses (0.7-5.6 mg/kg body weight) was depressed in a dose-dependent fashion. Linear regression analysis revealed a high degree of correlation between residual sucrase activity and area under blood glucose curve (r = 0.9837). Similar degrees of correlation were found between acarbose dose and area under blood glucose curve (r = -0.9322), and between residual sucrase activity and acarbose dose (r = -0.9695). These data confirm that acarbose is a selective alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that does not affect monosaccharidase transport. In the presence of acarbose, alpha-glucosidase absorption is diminished in a dose-dependent fashion. Postprandial glucose rise following an alpha-glucosidase meal seems to be determined, in the presence of graded acarbose inhibition, by residual mucosal alpha-glucosidase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Acetaminophen has recently been reported to protect against drug damage to gastric mucosa in vivo. The present study tested acetaminophen protection in cultured rat gastric mucous cells against sodium taurocholate-induced damage and assessed the role of endogenous prostaglandins. Cell damage was assessed by phase-contrast microscopy and quantitated by Chromium-51 release assay which positively correlated with the trypan blue dye exclusion test (r = 0.98). The effect of acetaminophen on the production of PGE2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1a (6KF) was also studied. Sodium taurocholate caused cell death in a dose-dependent manner as indicated by increased 51Cr release. Preincubation with 5 mM acetaminophen significantly reduced 51Cr release caused by 5 mM sodium taurocholate, producing a 40% increase in cell survival. This cytoprotection was not blocked by indomethacin. PGE2 and 6KF of the media did not change after preincubation with nondamaging concentrations of acetaminophen or taurocholate. These results indicate that: (1) acetaminophen exerts a direct protective effect on gastric mucous cells cultured in vitro independent of indirect factors such as blood flow and (2) this protection is not associated with increased prostaglandin production.\r"

In the second phase, we studied a group of 59 chronically constipated individuals treated with daily doses of the laxative containing either 1, 2, or 4 g of methylcellulose or 3.4 g psyllium. All of these doses resulted in statistically significant increases in stool frequency, water content, and fecal solids.

To determine whether this phenomenon also occurs in normal children and adolescents, we evaluated plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and growth hormone levels during the early morning in 31 normal children between the ages of 8 and 18 yr. Blood samples were obtained through an indwelling catheter every 20 min for growth hormone and hourly for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide from 2100 to 0900 h. Glucose levels decreased slowly overnight from 2100 to 0900 h, despite increases in growth hormone levels. No significant rise in insulin or C-peptide levels was detected in the early morning in these normal subjects. There were no significant differences between prepubertal and pubertal children. We conclude that glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels remain stable overnight, suggesting that the dawn phenomenon is not observed in normal children.\r"

After a 4-wk run-in period during which all previous antihypertensive drugs were discontinued, treatment was commenced with one daily dose of 10 mg enalapril. The dose was adjusted upward at 3-wk intervals to a maximum of 40 mg daily. In 3 subjects, addition of a thiazide diuretic was required after 9 wk of treatment. At completion of run-in and after 9 and 13 wk of treatment, subjects had blood samples drawn after fasting and 2 h after a standardized 1.6-mJ mixed meal. Mean fasting blood glucose at the end of the run-in period was 8.3 +/- 0.5 mM and at study completion was 7.3 +/- 0.4 mM. Mean postprandial blood glucose was 10.8 +/- 1.0 mM before treatment and 9.8 +/- 0.7 mM at study completion. The changes in fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels were not significant (P = .06 and P = .15, respectively). There was no significant change in glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Fasting and meal-stimulated insulin and C-peptide levels were not altered by enalapril treatment. Treatment was associated with a sustained reduction in plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, an increase in plasma renin activity, reduced plasma aldosterone levels, and significant reductions in supine, seated, and standing arterial blood pressures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A thorough knowledge of normal esophageal anatomy and physiology is important to a full understanding of these motility derangements. Through a complicated interaction of neuromuscular and hormonal influences, the voluntary act of swallowing transforms into an automated sequence of peristaltic waves propelling food and liquids into the stomach in concert with coordinated relaxation of the sphincters. Anatomic and physiologic barriers exist within the esophagus protecting against gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration. With improvements in diagnostic tools such as barium contrast radiography, scintigraphy, pH measurements, and esophageal manometrics with provocative testing, motility disorders have become better defined and understood. Primary motility disorders consist of achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), \"nutcracker esophagus,\" hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter, and nonspecific esophageal motility dysfunction (NEMD). A host of secondary and miscellaneous motility disorders also affect the esophagus, including scleroderma and other connective tissue diseases, diabetes mellitus, Chagas' disease, chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and neuromuscular disorders of striated muscle. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may also be promoted by associated motility disturbances. Treatment modalities include surgical myotomy; dilatation; and pharmacologic manipulations, including use of nitrates, calcium-channel blockers, H2-blockers, and psychotropic drugs where appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "Lisinopril is a new, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor approved for the treatment of hypertension. After oral administration, 25-29 percent of the dose is absorbed intact; biotransformation is not required for pharmacological activity. Onset of action occurs one to two hours after administration, with effects still present 24 hours later. The major route of elimination is through renal excretion and an elimination half-life of 12.6 hours has been reported in normotensive individuals. In patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 ml/min) a longer half-life and accumulation have been observed. Lisinopril 20-80 mg/d has been shown to be as effective as hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, and beta-blocking agents in the treatment of essential hypertension. Its efficacy in renovascular hypertension has also been demonstrated. In congestive heart failure (CHF) doses of 2.5-20 mg/d appear to provide hemodynamic effects comparable to those of captopril. Dizziness and cough have been the most frequently reported side effects; rash and proteinuria have also been reported in a small number of patients. Interactions with diuretics, potassium supplements, and possibly with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents may occur. Lisinopril appears to be similar in efficacy to other antihypertensive agents in the treatment of essential hypertension and to captopril in the treatment of CHF. Whether lisinopril is safer or more effective than captopril or enalapril in the treatment of hypertension or CHF requires further investigation. Prolonged duration of action of lisinopril allows once daily dosing, unlike captopril for which dosing is required every 8-12 hours or enalapril which may necessitate twice daily dosing.\r"

Treatment is ineffective for a high percentage of patients with chronic prostatitis, both from proven bacterial and nonbacterial causes. Few drugs penetrate the prostatic tissues well, and few of those that do have an appropriate antimicrobial spectrum. An excellent, or even adequate, antibiotic for chronic prostatic infections has yet to be developed. Prostatodynia remains as a \"wastebasket\" syndrome of miscellaneous pains, aches, and pelvic discomforts. With this collection of symptoms, no easy approach to diagnosis or treatment is possible.

Each of these situations demands a more thorough evaluation and more prolonged and aggressive treatment to minimize the possibility of renal damage. Fortunately, there is a narrow spectrum of organisms responsible for most urinary tract infections, and they respond well to a wide range of commonly used antibiotics. Newer diagnostic techniques, the acceptance of short-course therapy for lower tract infections, and the development of new antibiotics have increased our diagnostic and therapeutic options. Further developments in these areas, as well as the possibility of nonantibiotic prevention of urinary tract infections, predict a brighter future for patients with complicated or frequently recurring urinary tract infections.\r"

The only erotic activities that have an unacceptable risk for injury are vaginal insufflation during pregnancy, and fist fornication. Many minor injuries of the genital, oral, and anal areas do occur but most require only symptomatic therapy. Vaginal lacerations focus primarily around the posterior fourchette, although the few most serious ones tend to be high in the vault. Following anal sex, minor rectal bleeding from anal fissures or small mucosal tears is neither uncommon nor serious. Although retained rectal foreign bodies may present a challenge to the physician's imagination, most can be removed in the Emergency Department, and laparotomy rarely is required. Rectal perforations and sphincter injuries are uncommon but may be caused by foreign objects. Rape is a common crime of violence in which a man uses sex as a weapon. A post-traumatic psychological syndrome, with both short-term and long-term dysfunctional elements, almost uniformly follows the attack. Oral and anal sex are part of the assault in many cases. Nongenital injuries may be documented in 40 per cent, but only 4 per cent are serious, and fewer than 1 per cent require hospitalization. Genital injuries can be found with special staining in almost 50 per cent of cases, but only 1 per cent will need repair. Men represent only 5 per cent of the adult sexual assault cases, but they tend to suffer more physical injury. Both rape and sexual child abuse are grossly underreported. Sexual misuse of children has a family focus and is appallingly common. The emotional impact on the child is largely a function of the family's reaction. When strangers are involved in the abuse there is more chance of injury. Significant fresh injury will be found in only 8 per cent and is most likely to be anogenital. Findings of chronic sexual abuse will be present in one third, however. Boys are the victims in 15 per cent of cases. Physicians must be educated and vigilant for sexually related injuries because people frequently will delay treatment and then provide misleading histories because of embarrassment.\r"

  ".U": "88271263\r", 
  ".W": "In boys and adolescents, the acute scrotum usually results from one of three diseases: torsion of the spermatic cord, torsion of the appendix testis, or epididymitis. A rapid diagnosis of torsion of the cord, if present, is essential, and as soon as this diagnosis is made, arrangements must be made for timely surgical correction. Although a diagnosis for the acute scrotum in this age group can sometimes be made on the basis of the history, pathognomonic signs, and basic laboratory analysis of the urine and a urethral discharge, in the usual case diagnosis requires a Doppler ultrasound examination (which if positive for torsion makes the diagnosis), a radionuclide scan (for cases negative or indeterminate for torsion on the Doppler examination), or, as a last resort, scrotal exploration. In men, by far the most common cause of the acute scrotum is epididymitis, with the torsions being much less common. In heterosexual young men with epididymitis, N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis are the most likely etiologic organisms; in homosexual men and older men (and boys), E. coli, Pseudomonas sp., and the gram-positive cocci are the most common pathogens. Ceftriaxone plus tetracycline is the initial antimicrobial regimen of choice in heterosexual young men; in the absence of evidence of a sexually transmitted pathogen, one of the antimicrobials effective against common urinary tract pathogens is the initial antimicrobial of choice in all other patients. When torsion of the cord is suspected in adult male patients, the Doppler examination and the radionuclide scan (if the Doppler is negative or indeterminate) can again make the diagnosis or rule it out.\r"

Significant risk factors include preexisting renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, advanced age, volume depletion, and presence of multiple myeloma. The diagnosis should be suspected with acute renal dysfunction temporally related to radiologic contrast administration. The prognosis for recovery is good in most cases.

Suspicion of ureterolithiasis is based on a cogent history and physical examination and reinforced by a finding of hematuria. Diagnosis should be based upon a promptly performed intravenous pyelogram, unless the patient is truly allergic to contrast media or has substantial risk of a contrast-induced renal failure. A solitary flat plate of the abdomen adds no useful information and is an unnecessary expense to the patient. Essential laboratory data include a urinalysis, CBC, and electrolyte, BUN, creatinine, and serum calcium levels. A urine culture should be obtained in all patients because urinalysis alone may not be sufficient to exlude a urinary tract infection. Initial treatment of the patient with an uncomplicated renal colic should include hydration, relief of pain, and reassurance. Evaluation by a consultant may be done as an outpatient on a nonemergent basis. If the colic has not resolved after 72 hours, hospitalization generally is recommended. If the patient has vomiting, dehydration, a complete obstruction, or a solitary kidney, hospitalization in indicated and urgent consultation recommended. If the patient has fever or other signs of infection, emergent consultation and immediate hospitalization are essential. Retained obstructing stones are generally managed by urologic consultants. It is in the care of the patient with the retained stone that greatest advances have been made in the past 10 years. Patients should be counseled that the retained stone no longer calls for extended hospitalization and convalescence.\r"

  ".W": "Convulsive dose 50s (CD50s) for various convulsive drugs and minimal and maximal electroshock seizure thresholds were determined in DBA and C57 mice. DBA mice had lower maximal electroshock seizure thresholds (MESTs, 15%) and CD50s for homocysteine thiolactone (HTL, 23%) and bicuculline (69%), and a higher CD50 for pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) at 3 weeks of age, the age of maximal audiogenic seizure (AGS) susceptibility. At 8 weeks, when DBA mice are not susceptible to AGSs, significant differences were a lower minimal electroshock seizure threshold (mEST, 37%) and maximal EST (MEST) (19%), lower CD50s for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (39%), kainic acid (KA, 50%), HTL (32%), strychnine (37%), and a higher CD50 for nicotine (55%) in DBA mice. Based on these data it is suggested that pathways involving NMDA and KA receptors are responsible for increased susceptibility to seizure initiation (mEST), and are opposed by glycine pathways, and that opposing GABA and cholinergic systems at higher CNS levels are involved in seizure spread (AGSs and MEST) in these mice. Latency patterns indicate that nicotine, strychnine, PTZ and bicuculline have high blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrability. Picrotoxin and the excitatory amino acid receptor agonists had longer latencies, suggesting low BBB penetrability. Age-related changes in latency, however, give evidence that difficulty in drug penetration of the BBB is not responsible for differences observed in CD50s between strains.\r"

  ".W": "The \"severity\" of a disease is a relative expression and its definition will vary depending on the perspective of the observer. The patient's subjective perception of the disease, the way it is regarded socially by the community, and the doctor's objective assessment rarely coincide. In fact, they are frequently diametrically opposed. As far as the patient's personal perception of epilepsy is concerned, there has apparently been no satisfactory attempt thus far at a systematic grading of the subjective handicap, despite the growth of interest in psychological matters and the self-help movement. Similarly, social ability or disability cannot be adequately assessed on the basis of medical criteria such as frequency and type of seizures. We present a grading system which will serve as an example of an appropriate method of assessing social abilities, and which will permit the patient's occupational potential to be estimated in relation to the risk of accidents resulting from seizures. From the medical point of view, the impairment of a patient's abilities due to epilepsy is a function of the patient's responsiveness to treatment. We present a critical review of the factors which have an effect on the therapeutic prognosis: the causes of epilepsy, underlying structural lesions, the incidence of convulsive status epilepticus, various types of attacks, and the different epileptic syndromes. Taking two examples--epilepsy presenting in the form of absence and epilepsy with complex focal seizures--we show that ultimately the \"severity of epilepsy\" can only be defined from the medical standpoint on the basis of several factors whose value is of a predictive nature.\r"

Patients who fail to respond to monotherapy, who are not suitable for surgery, and who continue to have frequent seizures may have to be considered for an alternative drug regimen. A review of the literature indicates that complete seizure control with adjunctive treatment is rare, but improved seizure control can be obtained in up to 40% of patients. In a study of clobazam as adjunctive treatment, 60% (N = 20) of our patients responded to treatment initially and 33% maintained an improvement over an 18-month period. In 31 patients who failed to respond to carbamazepine as monotherapy, primidone (N = 16) or valproate (N = 15) were prescribed as adjunctive treatment. One patient obtained complete freedom from seizures and 14 (45%) had a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency.

This is inevitably an incomplete and impressionistic survey, because data on many aspects in developing countries are scarce, and because it is difficult to generalise meaningfully about the enormous diversity of countries and populations that make up the developing world. Epidemiological studies of prevalence and incidence are reviewed with an emphasis on the problems inherent in work in this area in developing countries. Data concerning seizure type, aetiology, and severity of seizures in the Third World are contrasted with those from developed countries. Sociocultural aspects of epilepsy have been poorly studied, and yet are fundamental to effective medical management. The social effects of epilepsy and the local perceptions of cause and of treatment are discussed from work in Africa, Asia, and South America. The principles and success of treatment in the Third World may differ considerably in developing and developed countries. In the Third World, medical manpower is scarce, and epilepsy is managed essentially by primary care resources, without specialised investigations or personnel. The principles of drug therapy may not be understood by patients, and the supply of drugs is often erratic; and these are major reasons for poor compliance with treatment. World Health Organisation (WHO) initiatives have stressed the extensive use of paramedical personnel and of an essential drugs list, but this emphasis may be misdirected, and in practice neither proposal has achieved much success. The recommendation that phenobarbital be extensively used in the Third World, because of its cheapness and efficacy, is also of doubtful merit, as there are well-known and major drawbacks to the widespread use of this drug. Computations of treatment gap figures in three developing countries suggest that between 80-94% of patients with active epilepsy are not receiving anticonvulsant therapy, and cost is only one of a number of reasons for this. The key to improvements in medical treatment lie with a better understanding of the patients' cultural concepts of epilepsy and its treatment, improved drug supply and availability, and efforts to improve education amongst general practitioners and other primary care medical personnel.\r"

A wide variety of potential second-messenger molecules are generated during the phospholipase C-mediated cleavage of these strategically situated membrane phospholipids. Several distinct but interrelated issues are addressed in this perspective. These include 1) methodological approaches utilized to assess PI turnover, 2) the synergistic relationship between PI-derived second messengers and cAMP, 3) the contribution of changing PI turnover rates to the biphasic pattern of insulin output induced by 20 mM glucose, and 4) the role played by PI turnover in the phenomenon of \"memory\" displayed by islets after prior stimulation with various agonists. The concept that events unique to PI turnover contribute to beta-cell activation is well founded. Because of uncertainty regarding the exact nature of all PI-derived messengers, however, it is not yet possible to mold the available information into a comprehensive theory of beta-cell activation. Future studies will have to address various important unresolved issues.\r"

Diabetes produced no change in contents of cholesterol, total phospholipids, and proportions of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in phospholipids. The acylation of total phospholipids with palmitic, oleic, or arachidonic acids was decreased (P less than .01) in intact erythrocytes from diabetic versus control animals. This anomaly was underlaid by a decrease (P less than .01) in acylation of phosphatidylcholine, whereas phosphatidylethanolamine was unaffected. The impaired acylation of phosphatidylcholine was unchanged in vitro by insulin or coenzyme A but was restored to control values by ATP and by insulin treatment of the diabetic rats. We conclude that diabetes specifically alters the acylation of at least phosphatidylcholine in rat erythrocyte, an effect that might modify the remodeling of erythrocyte phospholipids and thereby the membrane function.\r"

Rate of [3H]leucine incorporation into proinsulin was increased as glucose concentrations were raised from 0 to 20 mM. Biosynthetic rate increases were significant after 48 but not at 4 or 24 h of glucose and were greater for proinsulin than for total extractable proteins. After 48 h, glucose-stimulated proinsulin biosynthesis was unaffected by 10(-6) M forskolin and/or 3 x 10(-5) M IBMX but was specifically and significantly inhibited by 10(-6) M dexamethasone. Four hours of exposure to dexamethasone had no effect. When cells were incubated for 24 h and then continuously labeled for an additional 24 h, cellular conversion of labeled proinsulin to insulin was increased by glucose, and this increase was reversed or inhibited by 10(-6) M dexamethasone. Therefore, proinsulin biosynthesis in transformed HIT T-15 cells is regulated in several ways by metabolites and hormones in a manner that compares with biosynthetic regulation in normal beta-cells.\r"

Protamines are also administered in large doses for heparin neutralization in cardiac procedures. This study used a rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to examine frequency of protamine antibodies in diabetic and control populations. Antigen specificity of the IgG binding to protamine-coated plates was verified by competitive inhibition with other protamines, histone, glucagon, thyroid-stimulating hormone, arginine, and lysine. All antibodies tested cross-reacted completely with all protamines. Only 4 of 18 had any cross-reactivity with histones. None cross-reacted with the other inhibitors. In population surveys, 122 (38%) of 319 NPH insulin-treated diabetic subjects, 3 (8%) of 39 diabetic subjects treated with protamine-free lente insulins, and 5 (2.5%) of 202 normal control subjects had protamine antibody. No correlation was found between insulin and protamine antibodies. Because more than one-third of insulin-treated diabetic subjects have circulating IgG specific for protamine, they are potentially at risk for acute immunologic or anaphylactoid reactions when protamine is administered for heparin neutralization.\r"

The resultant diabetes mellitus, not treated with insulin, was associated with persistent manifoldly increased plasma IgA levels, as measured by single-radial immunodiffusion after reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetamide. Also observed were concurrent increases in plasma levels of secretory IgA (sIgA) and of C3- and IgA-containing immune complexes (C3-IgA-CIC). After 104 days without insulin treatment, six of the diabetic rats were given daily injections of 2 U of insulin for 11 days. Insulin treatment was associated with a precipitous decrease in plasma levels of IgA, sIgA, and C3-IgA-CIC. Cessation of insulin treatment resulted in restoration of greatly increased levels of all three IgA-containing species. Histoimmunofluorescence studies of kidneys from untreated rats with diabetes of 192-324 days revealed glomerular capillary wall and mesangial deposits reacting strongly with anti-IgA (alpha-chain-specific) antiserum. Kidneys from two of the diabetic rats (324 days) were tested with anti-rat C3 and anti-rat secretory component (SC) antisera, and they reacted positively. Control kidneys from normal rats examined simultaneously were negative. The concurrent changes in plasma levels of three IgA-containing species in the untreated STZ-induced diabetic rat and the demonstration of abnormal immunoreactive IgA-containing renal glomerular deposits make this experiment an attractive model for studying the possible role of disturbed IgA metabolism in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.\r"

Two tinctorial subsets of dark and light intracellular granules were analyzed by morphometry at the ultrastructural level. The two types of granules were similar in size and shape. However, with 3 mM glucose the dark granule cores were surrounded by larger vesicles than the light granules. With 20 mM glucose, both types of granule vesicles and cores became smaller and dark-granule cores became more rounded, compared with cultures with 3 mM glucose. The higher glucose concentration also induced a marked decrease in the number (-84%) and volume density (-90%) of dark granules. In contrast, the number of light granules increased (+60%) with maintenance of their volume density. We suggest that the dark Rambourg-positive and the light Rambourg-negative beta-cell granules are functionally distinct subsets. The dark granules are probably engaged in insulin discharge. We discuss the unclear role of the light granules with a view to previously postulated heterogeneities of the insulin granule pool and their significance for exocytosis and intracellular hormone degradation.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the contribution of changes in insulin secretion and clearance to the incretin effect (greater insulinemia after oral than after intravenous glucose), 10 healthy subjects were studied after oral glucose (1 g/kg body wt) and again when glucose was infused intravenously at rates to match arterialized plasma glucose concentrations after oral glucose. Although basal and integrated plasma glucose did not differ between oral and intravenous glucose, integrated responses of insulin (3.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.4 mU ml-1.240 min-1, P less than .001), C-peptide (456.5 +/- 58.5 vs. 327.9 +/- 46.3 ng.ml-1.240 min-1, P = .002), gastric inhibitory polypeptide, (16.8 +/- 3.5 vs. -2.8 +/- 1.0 micrograms.ml-1.240 min-1, P less than .001), and insulin secretion (6.6 +/- 1.1 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.7 U.240 min-1, P = .003) were greater with oral than intravenous glucose. However, insulin clearance, whether calculated as the molar ratio of integrated C-peptide to integrated insulin responses (6.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 14.2 +/- 3.8, P = .005) or from the formula insulin clearance equals insulin secretion divided by integrated insulin responses (1.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.7 L.min-1.m-2, respectively, P = .002), was less for oral than for intravenous glucose. Therefore, the incretin effect is mediated both by increased secretion and decreased clearance of insulin.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the pathogenesis of insulitis in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, an animal model for human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, T-lymphocyte-depleted NOD mice (B mice) were adoptively transferred with spleen and lymph node cells from cyclophosphamide-treated NOD mice after separating the cells with monoclonal antibodies against various T-lymphocyte surface antigens plus complement. Light-microscopic and immunohistochemical studies were also performed to investigate the lymphocytic infiltrations. The incidence of insulitis detected in B mice was much lower when compared with that of the lesion naturally occurring in the NOD mouse. However, higher incidence of insulitis was inducible in B mice by transferring unfractionated lymphoid cells from NOD mice. When the Thy1+ cell-depleted fraction was transferred into the B mice, no increase in the incidence of insulitis was observed. The Lyt1+ or L3T4+ cell-eliminated fraction was also unable to transfer insulitis. Conversely, donor cells depleted of Lyt2+ components successfully induced insulitis in the recipient B mice. These data were consistent with the immunohistochemical study, which showed that the main phenotype of the cells infiltrating the islets was L3T4+. These results suggest the importance of L3T4+Lyt2- T-lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of insulitis in NOD mice.\r"

  ".W": "Recent in vitro studies have shown that insulin release caused by continuous exposure to high glucose concentration markedly falls within a few hours. We wanted to determine if a similar effect occurs in vivo with chronic intravenous infusions in normal rats. Male CD rats (200-250 g) were infused with 50% glucose at 2 ml/h for 6, 14, 24, or 48 h, whereas controls received 0.45% NaCl, and insulin responses were tested with the in vitro isolated perfused pancreas. Plasma glucose averaged 352 +/- 20 mg/dl after 4 h and 396 +/- 11 mg/dl after 24 h versus 137 +/- 5 mg/dl in controls; plasma insulin at the same times was 8.94 +/- 1.44 and 12.1 +/- 2.62 ng/ml versus 1.69 +/- 0.19 ng/ml in controls. The incremental insulin response caused by an increase in perfusate glucose from 2.8 to 16.7 mM was not significantly reduced after 24 h of glucose infusion; in contrast, paradoxical suppression was seen after 48 h. A second protocol examined glucose potentiation by giving 10 mM arginine at 2.8 and 16.7 mM glucose; a hyperresponse to arginine at the lower glucose level was present after just 14 h of infusion. Therefore, these results do not support the hypothesis that beta-cells lose their sensitivity to glucose within hours of being exposed to higher than normal glucose concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Methods for measuring insulin secretion and hepatic insulin extraction in vivo, e.g., hepatic vein catheterization, are invasive, and can be applied during steady state only. We introduce a noninvasive method for measuring in vivo insulin secretion and its extraction by the liver during an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). This method is based on a minimal model of C-peptide secretion and kinetics that is used for interpreting plasma C-peptide concentration data during an IVGTT in normal humans. The model allows the reconstruction of the time course of insulin secretion and, used in conjunction with a minimal model of insulin delivery and kinetics (described in a previous study), provides a noninvasive measure of the time course of hepatic insulin extraction [H(t)]. The C-peptide model also provides a direct prehepatic measure of beta-cell sensitivity to glucose, expressed by two parameters related to first (phi IC)- and second (phi IIC)-phase insulin secretion. In the 11 healthy volunteers we studied, these parameters were 61 +/- 11 pM.min-1.mg-1.dl and 0.0154 +/- 0.0034 pM.min-2.mg-1.dl, respectively. H(t) showed an initial decrement for approximately 30-50 min (from a fasting value of 63 +/- 8% to a nadir of 53 +/- 9%) after the glucose stimulus, then a steady value of approximately 62% was reestablished and maintained throughout the experiment. The validity of the C-peptide model was further assessed by comparing its estimate of the fractional plasma clearance rate (k01) with that obtained in experiments in which biosynthetic human C-peptide was administered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study we examine the growth of both the exocrine and endocrine tissue 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after PX by following the pancreatic content of insulin, glucagon, and amylase as well as the mitotic indices for exocrine and islet beta-cells. By 7 days the pancreatic remnant weighed more than the anatomically equivalent tissue in the sham, the remnant equivalent. The growth of the exocrine tissue and the endocrine beta-cells was discordant during these initial weeks after PX, as shown by the mitotic index. The mitotic index, measured as accumulated mitotic figures after a 4-h colchicine treatment, for both the exocrine and beta-cells in the sham animals was low and unchanging at the different time points (approximately 0.5%). At 3 and 7 days after PX, both the exocrine and beta-cells had mitotic indices three- to fourfold that of the sham animals. At 14 days after PX, the exocrine cells had a slightly, albeit significantly, elevated mitotic index, whereas that of the beta-cells was still double that of the shams. By 21 days there was no difference in mitotic index for exocrine tissue, but the beta-cells on the PX animals had a mitotic index still double that of the shams. Another index of growth, the cell birthrate, was estimated at 7 days from the slope of regression lines of the mitotic frequency accumulated 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after colchicine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "With the organ-balance technique, we studied amino acid and glucose metabolism by hepatic and extrahepatic splanchnic tissues in awake dogs in the postabsorptive state and during a 3-h intravenous amino acid infusion. Dogs received a high (1.4 g/kg body wt, n = 5) or low (0.7 g/kg body wt, n = 8) dose of amino acids. In four of the latter dogs, the dose was delivered into a mesenteric vein. During the basal period there was a net removal of gluconeogenic amino acids (particularly alanine), but not branched-chain amino acids, and a net production of glucose by the liver in all dogs. During this time there was a net removal of glucose and production of alanine by the extrahepatic splanchnic tissues. During either high- or low-dose amino acid infusion, net hepatic glucose release increased; despite this, arterial plasma glucose declined due to an increase in tissue glucose uptake at extrasplanchnic sites. The net amount of glucogenic amino acids removed by the liver during high-dose (9.1 +/- 1.0 mmol.kg-1.3 h-1) and low-dose (4.8 +/- 0.6 mmol.kg-1.3 h-1) infusion equaled or exceeded the infused load of these amino acids. In addition, the liver contributed to the net disposal of branched-chain amino acids during high-dose (536 +/- 147 mumol.kg-1.3 h-1) and low-dose (341 +/- 70 mumol.kg-1.3 h-1) infusion. During high-dose infusion, extrahepatic splanchnic tissues participated in the net removal of branched-chain amino acids (436 +/- 162 mumol.kg-1.3 h-1) but not glucogenic amino acids, and net alanine production continued (410 +/- 91 mumol.kg-1.3 h-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The rate of encapsulation of insulin is 54.9%, and we studied the therapeutic efficiency of the nanocapsules in diabetic and normal rats. When administered subcutaneously, insulin-loaded nanocapsules prolonged the hypoglycemic effect of insulin; the duration of this effect increased with the doses. When administered orally by force-feeding to diabetic rats, insulin nanocapsules (12.5, 25, and 50 U/kg) decreased fasted glycemia 50-60% by day 2. This effect was maintained for 6 or 20 days with 12.5 or 50 U/kg, respectively. Only the dose of 100 U/kg decreased fed glycemia by 25% in diabetic rats. In normal rats, hyperglycemia induced by an oral glucose load was reduced by 50% with the same dose of oral insulin nanocapsules. We concluded that polyalkylcyanoacrylate nanocapsules preserve the therapeutic effect of insulin when administered orally and prolong this effect when administered subcutaneously and orally.\r"

Adherents of a countertrend have long suggested the importance of analysis of HLA haplotypes (combinations of alleles on 1 chromosome) rather than individual genes. Accumulating data suggest that the relationship between IDDM susceptibility and HLA is much more complex than a single susceptibility gene. Consideration of this question should include the possibilities that 1) more than one HLA gene is involved in determining susceptibility or resistance; 2) different alleles of the same gene may be associated with different pathogenetic mechanisms; and 3) different susceptibility-associated haplotypes, even if they share an allele at an IDDM-relevant locus, may behave differently in IDDM. A better understanding of the genetics, and perhaps the pathogenesis, of IDDM may be obtained by following up the clues offered by analysis of the association of HLA haplotypes (rather than individual alleles) with one another, with clinical features of IDDM, and with possible non-HLA-linked susceptibility factors.\r"

  ".W": "A common mechanism has been proposed for the beta-cell toxins alloxan (ALX) and streptozocin (STZ) involving the formation of single-strand breaks in DNA that lead to the overactivation of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase and the critical depletion of its substrate NAD. If the toxins act via this common mechanism, the poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase inhibitors nicotinamide and thymidine would be expected to affect the formation of DNA single-strand breaks in a similar fashion. To test the effects of these inhibitors, the formation of single-strand breaks in the DNA of insulin-secreting RINr cells was monitored by assessing changes in the supercoiling of nucleoids after exposure to STZ, ALX, or methylnitrosourea (MNU). With the inclusion of nicotinamide or thymidine and STZ or MNU, more single-strand breaks in RINr cell DNA were detected. These results would be expected if nicotinamide and thymidine acted through inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase. However, when the inhibitors were used in combination with ALX, fewer single-strand breaks were present. This suggests a reduction in ALX-induced hydroxyl radicals available to interact with DNA. Because nicotinamide has been demonstrated to be a hydroxyl-radical scavenger, the ability of thymidine to scavenge hydroxyl radicals was investigated. Thymidine, like nicotinamide, was found to be a potent scavenger of hydroxyl radicals. Thus, the mechanisms by which nicotinamide and thymidine protect against the toxic effects of STZ or ALX appear different. These findings suggest that the actions of beta-cell toxins are more complex than simply the overactivation of a single enzyme.\r"

In addition, hepatic glucose production (HGP) was measured from midnight to 0800 in normal individuals and patients with severe NIDDM. Plasma glucose concentration was highest in patients with severe NIDDM, lowest in those with normal glucose tolerance, and intermediate in those with mild NIDDM (two-way ANOVA, P less than .001). Variations in plasma FFA and lactate levels of the three groups were qualitatively similar, with lowest concentrations seen in normal individuals, intermediate levels in the group with mild NIDDM, and the highest concentration in those with severe NIDDM (two-way ANOVA, P less than .001). Of particular interest was the observation that plasma FFA concentrations were dramatically elevated from midnight to 0800 in patients with severe NIDDM. The 24-h insulin response was significantly increased in patients with mild NIDDM, with comparable values seen in the other two groups. Values for HGP fell progressively throughout the night in normal individuals and patients with severe NIDDM, despite a concomitant decline in plasma glucose and insulin levels. Although the magnitude of the fall in HGP was greater in NIDDM, the absolute value was significantly (P less than .001) greater than normal throughout the period of observation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that conventional tracer methods applied to euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps result in substantially negative estimates for the rate of endogenous glucose production, particularly during the first half of 180-min clamps. We also showed that addition of tracer to the exogenous glucose infusate resulted in nonnegative endogenous glucose production (Ra) estimates. In this study, we investigated the underlying cause of negative estimates of Ra from conventional clamp/tracer methods and the reason for the difference in estimates when tracer is added to the exogenous glucose infusate. We performed euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (300-microU/ml) clamps in normal dogs without (cold GINF protocol, n = 6) or with (hot GINF protocol, n = 6) tracer (D-[3-3H]glucose) added to the exogenous glucose infusate. In the hot GINF protocol, sufficient tracer was added to the exogenous glucose infusate such that arterial plasma specific activity (SAa) did not change from basal through the clamp period (P greater than .05). In the cold GINF studies, plasma SAa fell 81 +/- 2% from the basal level by the 3rd h of clamping. We observed a significant, transient, positive venous-arterial difference in specific activity (SAv-SAa difference) during the cold GINF studies. The SAv-SAa difference reached a peak of 27 +/- 6% at 30 min and diminished to a plateau of 7 +/- 1% between 70 and 180 min. We also observed a positive but constant SAv-SAa difference (4.6 +/- 0.2% between 10 and 180 min) during the hot GINF studies. The observations of a difference between hot and cold GINF endogenous Ra estimates and a positive but transient SAv-SAa difference during the cold GINF studies are consistent with the interpretation that a portion of the underestimation of Ra is due to insufficient mixing of endogenous and exogenous glucose for the one-compartment, fixed-pool volume model to be applicable. Alternatively, our results suggest that the one-compartment, fixed-pool volume model of glucose kinetics is insufficient to account for the complex dynamics of labeled and unlabeled glucose during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps. Improved mixing through addition of tracer to the exogenous glucose infusate or improved modeling by allowing for a variable-pool volume appears to improve the accuracy of the tracer methods; however, these approaches remain to be validated. The constant positive SAv-SAa difference observed during the hot GINF studies is consistent with the interpretation that an additional contributor to underestimation of endogenous Ra is apparent isotope discrimination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The major population of infiltrated cells found during the early stages of insulitis appeared to be macrophages. This preceded invasion by a mixed population of cells, including both T- and B-lymphocytes and/or natural killer cells. The preferential infiltration of macrophages during the early stages of insulitis strongly suggested that there might be an initial change in the target beta-cells that precedes their immune destruction, although the amplification of immune response by activated T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells at a later stage seemed to be required for the clinical expression of the disease.\r"

These aggregates may originate in therapeutic insulin, because similar substances account for 0.1-3% of these preparations. Larger amounts in blood imply that aggregates accumulate as a result of delayed clearance. To test and quantify this speculation, we calculated the plasma kinetics of this material in four normal volunteers who received large intravenous doses (30 mU.kg-1.min-1) of beef-pork crystalline zinc insulin for 120 min. Insulin aggregate and monomer concentrations were measured in blood samples obtained at regular intervals throughout the infusion and during 4 h after discontinuation of insulin. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the data. Insulin aggregate and monomer serum t 1/2 were 63.6 +/- 6.9 and 34.3 +/- 2.8 min, respectively, and clearances were 101 +/- 10 and 232 +/- 47 ml/min. Volume of distribution (V beta) and volume at steady state (Vss) were 9.1 +/- 1.8 and 8.2 +/- 2.2 L for insulin aggregate and 11.6 +/- 2.8 and 12.2 +/- 3.6 L for insulin monomer, respectively. Mean residency time was 141 +/- 14 and 114 +/- 10 min for insulin aggregate and monomer, respectively [P less than .01 for all parameters except V beta (.014) and Vss (.012), aggregate vs. monomer]. Thus, in relation to insulin monomer, calculated pharmacokinetic parameters of the aggregate predict accumulation after insulin injection. Plasma t 1/2 of the aggregate was almost double that of monomeric insulin; total-body clearance and the corresponding volumes of distribution were smaller.\r"

Helical strips were suspended in an organ bath filled with modified Krebs solution (pH 7.4), were gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2 at 36 degrees C, and isotonic contractions were measured. Insulin significantly and dose dependently inhibited the vasoconstriction induced by NE (10(-8) M for the artery and 10(-7) M for the vein) at greater than or equal to 1.2 mU/ml for both the artery and vein and the vasoconstriction induced by ANG II (3 x 10(-10) M for the artery and 3 x 10(-9) M for the vein) at greater than or equal to 1.2 mU/ml for the artery and greater than or equal to 12 mU/ml for the vein. The results indicate that insulin has an inhibitory effect on NE- and ANG II-induced contraction in both the artery and vein, and this appeared to be a contributory factor in the hypotensive effect observed in diabetic patients treated with insulin.\r"

Streptozocin-induced insulin deficiency caused hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia in mice. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from insulin-deficient mice secreted 70% less LPL activity than control mice. A 65% decrease in LPL activity in epididymal adipose tissue, without any changes in heart LPL activity, was also seen with insulin deficiency. One week of insulin treatment lowered plasma glucose and triglyceride levels in insulin-deficient mice. Additionally, 1 wk of insulin treatment increased LPL secretion by macrophages, but to only one-half of control, while normalizing adipose tissue LPL activity. One injection of insulin also increased LPL secretion by macrophages to one-half of control and normalized adipose tissue LPL activity, even though plasma glucose and triglyceride levels were not affected. In vitro insulin treatment of macrophages isolated from control or insulin-deficient mice had no effect on LPL secretion. The results suggest that insulin does not exert a direct effect on the LPL secretion by macrophages but that deficiency of insulin indirectly causes a profound decrease in macrophage LPL secretion. These changes in macrophage LPL secretion may contribute to the atherosclerotic process in diabetes mellitus.\r"

The role of L3T4+ T-lymphocytes in destruction of beta-cells of the NOD mouse was studied in cyclophosphamide (CY)-induced diabetic NOD mice with a rat anti-L3T4 monoclonal antibody (MoAb). After administration of CY, most untreated animals became diabetic, whereas all antibody-treated animals remained normoglycemic. Insulitis was still present in MoAb-treated animals, but immunocytochemical staining showed rat antibody blocking the L3T4 antigen on T-lymphocytes. This study provides further evidence that L3T4+ T-lymphocytes are critical to the process of beta-cell destruction in NOD mice. The means by which L3T4+ cells exert their effect remains to be clarified.\r"

  ".W": "The liposome technique is widely used to transport substances that cannot normally traverse the plasma membrane into the cell. The interactions of liposomes with the plasma membrane of pancreatic islet cells have not previously been studied. We evaluate the suitability of the liposome technique for introducing substances into the pancreatic beta-cell to which the cell membrane is impermeable. Liposomes were synthesized with an ether-injection method, and the cell-liposomal interactions were investigated by means of radioactive labeling and the fluorescent aqueous space marker 6-carboxyfluorescein. Experiments were performed on freshly isolated mouse pancreatic islets and on free islet cell preparations. With fluorescence microscopy, liposomes were observed to fuse spontaneously with islet cells, and the corresponding internalized volumes were quantified with spectrofluorometric measurements. The liposome association with islets and islet cell suspensions, as assessed by radioactive labeling, was found to increase with the liposome concentration. The effects of liposome membrane lipid composition on the fusion rate were found to be decreased in the presence of glucolipid. In addition, polyethylene glycol failed to affect the liposomal uptake. Freshly isolated islets incubated with liposomes containing glucose 6-phosphate were observed to release slightly more insulin than islets incubated with \"empty\" liposomes. In conclusion, liposomes fuse spontaneously with islet cells in vitro, and the uptake of liposomes is regulated by the lipid composition of the liposomal bilayer and the amount of liposomes present. The function of the beta-cell can be altered with the liposome technique, e.g., by addition of biologically active molecules such as glucose 6-phosphate.\r"

Both glycoprotein and glycolipid islet cell antigens in the total pancreatic extracts were detected by the monoclonal islet cell antibody in the ELISA system, indicating that epitope preservation had occurred during the extraction procedure. There was a good correlation between islet cell antigen quantitated by the ELISA system and the corresponding islet immunohistochemical reaction. Studies along these lines have the potential to facilitate the design of large-scale protocols for the purification of diabetes-related islet cell antigens to homogeneity.\r"

By electrophoretic analysis, the major proteolytic bands in mucosal extracts from each of three strains of rats had rates of anodal migration that were similar to the fastest migrating isozymogens of human PG I. However, immunoblots revealed that these bands and several minor proteolytic bands with slower rates of anodal migration reacted with antiserum to PG II. Two proteolytic bands in rat gastric mucosa that migrated concurrently with human slow-moving proteinase reacted with antihuman slow-moving proteinase reacted with antihuman slow-moving proteinase. None of the proteolytic bands in rat gastric mucosa reacted with anti-PG I. By immunohistochemical staining, anti-PG I failed to stain any cells in rat fundic gland or antral mucosa. By contrast, anti-PG II stained mucus neck and chief cells in fundic gland mucosa and pyloric gland cells in antral mucosa, and anti-slow-moving proteinase stained surface and foveolar epithelial cells throughout the stomach.

  ".W": "The emergence of new glycoprotein structures in colonic mucosa from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) was assessed through the development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Hybridomas were prepared from mice immunized with mucin glycoproteins purified from UC colonic tissue. Supernatants of 11 fusion products among 1200 fusion products that were screened in a solid-phase binding assay differentially bound UC-derived colonic mucin glycoproteins relative to comparable preparations from normal or Crohn's colitis tissue. These hybridomas were double-cloned to yield MAbs designated as MAbs UC 1-11. Disease-related specificity of MAbs UC 1-11 was determined through assessment of binding to beads coated with mucin glycoproteins purified from individual samples of UC tissue (n = 15), normal tissue (n = 21), and Crohn's colitis tissue (n = 10). Monoclonal antibody UC 7, an MAb of immunoglobulin G2A subclass, showed differential binding in solid-phase assays to UC mucin glycoproteins, with a mean binding of 10,170 +/- 2740 cm per UC glycoprotein-coated bead versus 2300 +/- 1080 and 2470 +/- 1525 cpm for normal and Crohn's colitis-derived glycoproteins, respectively. Monoclonal antibody UC 11 showed similar differential binding to UC mucin glycoproteins (9860 +/- 680 cpm vs. 1770 +/- 420 cpm). Binding specificity in solid-phase assay was mirrored by colonic mucosal staining patterns assessed by indirect immunofluorescent staining. Monoclonal antibody UC 7 specifically stained colonic mucosa from 8 of 10 patients with active UC, none of the samples from 8 normal controls, and none of the samples from 11 disease controls (six with Crohn's colitis, five with other inflammatory disorders). Specific staining was present on both the epithelial surface and on cells scattered within the lamina propria. Staining by MAb UC 7 was also observed in 3 of 4 samples of proximal uninvolved mucosa from patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis and in 3 of 5 samples from UC patients without acute disease activity.\r"

Intensity and distribution of staining by three anti-HCM MAbs were significantly altered in mucosa from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 14) when compared with normal tissue (n = 15) and with tissue from patients with Crohn's disease as well as other inflammatory disorders (n = 15). Staining by anti-HCM MAb 17, which binds to colonic mucin glycoprotein species IV and V, was absent or diminished in 86% of samples from patients with active UC in contrast to 14% of normal and disease control specimens. Reduction in anti-HCM MAb 17 staining was less marked in mucosal biopsy specimens from patients with UC lacking acute inflammatory activity (n = 8). In contrast to the apparent loss of the MAb 17-defined epitopes, staining with anti-HCM MAbs 10 and 22 was enhanced in UC tissue compared with normal and disease controls. Increased staining with MAb 10 was present in 93% of samples from UC patients demonstrating active inflammation. Increased MAb 10 staining was not apparent in noninvolved mucosa from UC patients, indicating that increased expression of the specified epitope is related to the acute inflammatory process. In contrast, indirect immunofluorescent staining with MAb 22 was apparent in both involved (78%) and uninvolved (67%) UC mucosa in contrast to normal and disease controls (less than 12%). In addition, staining with several other anti-HCM MAbs (MAbs 3, 11, 15) was modestly and variably diminished (14%-28%) in UC, Crohn's disease, and other inflammatory disorders. These findings demonstrate the presence of alterations in mucosal content of specific glycoconjugate structures in association with UC. Inflammatory processes may also result in broad changes in glycoconjugate determinants generally.\r"

The cellular sources of proteoglycans are as yet incompletely defined. We examined this question using primary cultures of hepatocytes and lipocytes isolated from normal rat liver. Proteoglycan synthesis was assessed by measuring production of sulfated glycosaminoglycan, the polysaccharide moiety of proteoglycans. The findings indicate that lipocytes produce sixfold more glycosaminoglycan, per cell, than do hepatocytes. Two-thirds of the newly synthesized material is cell- or matrix-associated. Of the individual glycosaminoglycan species produced by lipocytes, dermatan sulfate represents 60% of the total; heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate are measurable but relatively minor. In hepatocyte cultures, heparan sulfate accounted for essentially all of the glycosaminoglycan detected. We conclude that lipocytes are an important source of proteoglycan in normal liver and may be the principal source of dermatan sulfate associated with hepatic fibrosis.\r"

A gluten-free diet and parenteral nutrition proved ineffective. A dramatic and protracted clinical response was observed in both patients after the onset of oral tetracycline therapy, and still persists after 8 and 5.5 yr, respectively, together with morphologically unchanged small bowel infiltrate. These cases may be the equivalents, in people from Western developed countries, of the predominantly lymphocytic variety of the immunoproliferative small intestinal disease described in people from developing countries.\r"

Two uncontrolled studies with follow-up and one randomized trial suggest a colorectal cancer mortality reduction because of the use of sigmoidoscopy, but all three studies have major shortcomings. The authors conclude that the currently available data are insufficient to establish a national recommendation for screening with sigmoidoscopy. To establish such a recommendation, a properly conducted randomized trial with colorectal cancer mortality as an outcome is needed.\r"

At low doses (1.5 Gy), one observes only a short prodromal syndrome consisting of nausea, vomiting, and gastric suppression. At doses greater than 6 Gy, the prodromal syndrome is more marked, and it is followed after a 2-5-day remission period by a subacute syndrome, characterized by diarrhea and hematochezia. This gastrointestinal syndrome is superimposed onto a radiation-induced bone marrow suppression. The combination of intestinal and hemopoietic syndromes results in dehydration, anemia, and infection, leading eventually to irreversible shock and death. The treatment of prodromal symptoms is based on the administration of antiemetics and gastrokinetics, although an effective treatment devoid of side effects is not yet available for human therapy. The treatment of the gastrointestinal subacute syndrome remains difficult and unsuccessful after exposure to total body doses greater than 8-10 Gy. Supportive therapy to prevent infection and dehydration may be effective if restoration or repopulation of the intestinal and bone marrow stem cells does occur. In addition, bone marrow transplantation may improve the prospect of treating the hemopoietic syndrome, although the experience gained in Chernobyl suggests that this treatment is difficult to apply in the case of nuclear accidents. Administration of radioprotectants before irradiation decreases damage to healthy cells, while not protecting cancerous tissues. In the future, stimulation of gastrointestinal and hemopoietic progenitor cells may be possible using cell growth regulators, but much remains to be done to improve the treatment of radiation damage to the gastrointestinal tract.\r"
