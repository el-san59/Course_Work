  ".W": "Penetrating proximity extremity trauma (PPET) was prospectively studied to clarify the role of routine arteriographic evaluation (AG). Over a 24-month period, 135 patients were identified with 152 injuries from PPET. All patients underwent AG and were randomized to either immediate or delayed timing. There were 27 arteriographic abnormalities from these 152 wounds, of which 16 (10.5%) were in major arteries. One acute arteriovenous fistula underwent immediate surgery. The remaining 15 major vessel injuries were nonoperatively observed, including seven cases of segmental arterial narrowing, six intimal flaps, and two small pseudoaneurysms (one of which enlarged and underwent surgical repair after 10 weeks of followup). Nine of the remaining 14 lesions resolved; two improved and three remained clinically unchanged over a mean followup interval of 2.7 months. Shotgun trauma was the mechanism which carried the greatest risk of significant vascular injury. Although \"soft\" clinical signs were significantly more predictive of vascular injury following PPET than proximity alone (p less than 0.0005), 50% of all injuries to major arteries did not manifest soft signs. No extremity morbidity resulted from delayed AG or from vascular injury management. We conclude from our study population: 1) the natural history of clinically occult arterial injuries was predominantly benign; 2) AG could be safely delayed up to 24 hours; 3) \"soft\" signs were not clinically useful predictors of vascular injury; and 4) with the exception of shotgun wounds, AG did not appear to be a cost effective screening modality, since detection of a single vascular injury requiring surgery cost $66,420.00.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to explain the failure of first clinical trials of autologous endothelial seeding in smokers, the initial reproductive capacity of saphenous vein endothelial cells from smokers and nonsmokers was studied by a replicate microwell technique. Endothelial cells were enzymatically harvested from saphenous vein segments of patients with coronary bypasses (21 smokers and 18 nonsmokers). After 15 minutes (group A) and 7 minutes (group B) of collagenase exposure, the endothelial cell harvest from donors who smoked was 41% (p less than 0.02) lower for group A and 30% (p less than 0.2) lower for group B than that from nonsmokers. In analogy, the viable cell yield was 32% (p less than 0.04) and 29% (p less than 0.05) lower for groups A and B, respectively, in cultures from donors who smoked. Daily cell counts over an ensuing 10-day period also revealed a significant difference in the proliferative behavior of endothelial cells from smokers and nonsmokers. Whereas endothelial cells from nonsmokers regularly entered the exponential phase of proliferation on day 4.4 +/- 1.8 (group A) and day 4.6 +/- 1.3 (group B), endothelial cells from smokers reached the logarithmic growth phase either with delay (day 6.8 +/- 2.1, group A) or remained completely quiescent (group B). Lower harvest efficiency and suppressed reproductive capacity of endothelial cells in smokers--on top of an already critically low inoculum in single-staged endothelial cell seeding--might explain the failure of initial clinical trials.\r"

Of 218 patients with hepatitis B and 140 patients with NANB hepatitis, 46% and 53%, respectively, had no commonly recognized source for infection. When these patients were compared with control subjects, significantly more patients with hepatitis B had multiple heterosexual partners, accounting for 14% of all hepatitis B infections; more patients with NANB hepatitis either had sexual or household contact with a person who had hepatitis in the past or had multiple heterosexual partners, accounting for 11% of all NANB infections. This is the first study to suggest that heterosexual transmission may play an important role in the spread of NANB hepatitis.\r"

All patients were initially studied in the basal state and then the effects of glucose infusion (GL, N = 13), lipid infusion (LIP, N = 11), or amino acid infusion (AA, N = 17) were determined. Ten patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) were also studied. The basal value for net protein catabolism (NPC) in GL patients was 1.53 +/- 0.4 (SEM) g/kg/day decreasing to 1.39 +/- 0.4 g/kg/day during glucose infusion (p less than 0.01). The basal NPC in the LIP group was 2.04 +/- 0.4 g/kg/day decreasing to 1.72 +/- 0.3 g/kg/day during lipid infusion (p less than 0.01). In the TPN patients the NPC was 0.79 +/- 0.46 g/kg/day whereas in the AA patients the basal value for NPC was 1.37 +/- 0.14 g/kg/day decreasing to -0.77 +/- 0.11 g/kg/day during amino acid infusion (p less than 0.0005). From our study we conclude that: (1) All substrates commonly used in intravenous feeding have the capacity to spare protein. (2) Protein sparing was more pronounced when a balanced amino acid infusion was used than with either glucose or lipid infusion alone. (3) This effect is not solely due to insulin secretion as larger insulin responses were seen with both GL and TPN patients. (4) These results may have implications for peripheral vein feeding with amino acid solutions where there is a contraindication for full TPN or the lack of resources for administering it.\r"

  ".W": "In July 1984, two patients fed enteral nutrition solutions contaminated with Enterobacter cloacae developed nosocomial bacteremia. Despite careful review of the preparation procedures as well as repeated microbiological surveys, 83 (27%) of the 309 formula bottles tested over a 1-yr period were contaminated and the source of contamination remained unknown. E. cloacae was the most frequent organism isolated (34%). The plasmid profiles of E. cloacae recovered from enteral nutrition solutions remained identical for several months. Blood culture isolates from 10 of the 40 patients who had developed E. cloacae nosocomial sepsis over a 7-yr period (1979-1985) had plasmid profiles linking them to contaminated enteral nutrition solutions. Epidemiological data from a case control study revealed that these 10 patients were indeed more likely to be exposed to enteral nutrition than the 30 others: 9/10 vs 10/30 (odds ratio 18, p = 0.002). Similarly, two of seven nosocomial Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremias over a 6-month period in 1986 could be ascribed to administration of contaminated enteral liquid feeds prompting a general policy for using sterile commercially prepared solutions. Our results suggest that contaminated enteral nutrition solutions represent a significant cause of nosocomial sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "Parenteral glucose and glucose-amino acid mixtures are used in the nutritional support of infants, children, and adults when enteral feedings are precluded for any reason. During the first week of such nutritional support, the total energy intakes are generally low and glucose and electrolytes are the only nutrients provided. To assess the effects of such \"hypocaloric\" regimens, we determined the hepatic responses to parenteral infusions of either glucose or glucose-amino acid mixtures in rats. Further, to illustrate the magnitude of these changes in comparison to normally fed animals, we included a group of sham-operated, chow-fed rats. Bile flow, biliary bile acid output, bile osmolarity, serum bile acids, and plasma amino acids were measured in adult rats following 5 days of the respective dietary regimens. Liver histology was also assessed. Bile acid output, but not bile flow, was significantly decreased by the infusion of glucose compared to glucose-amino acid mixtures. However, in comparison to the chow-fed rats, bile acid output was significantly reduced in both groups of parenterally fed animals, whereas bile flow was significantly reduced only in the glucose-infused animals. Plasma amino acids were markedly different between the groups; concentrations of essential amino acids were greater in the glucose-amino acid infused animals than in the glucose infused animals. Nonessential gluconeogenic amino acids were significantly higher in the glucose-infused animals compared to the other groups; plasma valine was significantly lower in the glucose-infused animals reflecting the lack of protein intake. Liver histology was markedly abnormal in all of the glucose-infused animals, whereas only half the glucose-amino acid infused animals had abnormal pathology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of this group, 97 patients (39%) were found to be at high risk of having clinically significant protein-energy malnutrition. In 43 cases (17%), an assessment of the patient's nutritional status was not possible because the available data were inadequate. No patient had a diagnosis of malnutrition recorded on the problem list. Only 13 percent of the high-risk patients received some form of nutrition support therapy; 10 (10%) received oral supplements, and four (4%) were started on enteral feedings. Patients who received enteral feedings experienced a high rate of complications resulting from use of the feeding tubes. Over all, none of the high risk study patients received optimal nutrition support therapy. These findings indicate that elderly patients hospitalized in the Veterans Administration hospital in this study are usually not screened appropriately for protein-energy malnutrition, the diagnosis is frequently missed or ignored, and nutrition support therapy is underutilized and often ineffectually managed.\r"

Life satisfaction measures were compared with that of end stage renal disease patients and the overall United States population.

The mean length of time respondents had been receiving home parenteral nutrition services was 35 months, reporting approximately one hospitalization per year due to complications of their home parenteral nutrition. Blood infection with catheter as focus was most frequently reported as being responsible for hospitalization. The number of hospitalizations due to complications of home parenteral nutrition therapy was positively correlated with length of time on the program. Overall, respondents were satisfied with their home nutrition services, but were less satisfied with life as a whole when compared to the overall United States population and to end stage renal disease patients.\r"

Thirty-five newborn Japanese white rabbits were divided into five groups. Rabbits in group I received glucose-based TPN solution, Group II received lipid-based solution, group III received larger amounts of amino acids than group I, and group IV received larger amounts of nonprotein calories than groups I and II. Rabbits in group V were given mother's milk freely. After the duration of TPN for 7 days, blood samples and liver were obtained when rabbits were killed. In group IV, the serum level of T-Bil (1.44 +/- 0.68 mg/dliter) was significantly higher than those in other groups (group I: 0.28 +/- 0.04 mg/dl; group II: 0.49 +/- 0.12 mg/dl; group III: 0.21 +/- 0.04 mg/dl; group V: 0.28 +/- 0.07 mg/dl), and serum level of GOT (44.2 +/- 25.2 units) and total bile acid (20.6 +/- 8.9 nmol/ml) were significantly higher than those in groups I, II, and III (group I: 16.8 +/- 7.8 units and 6.7 +/- 3.3 nmol/ml, group II: 21.5 +/- 7.9 units and 12.5 +/- 6.4 nmol/ml, group III: 14.3 +/- 4.2 units and 8.4 +/- 5.0 nmol/ml, respectively). Furthermore, there was histological cholestasis characterized by bile plugs in bile ducts, and bile pigments in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, whereas there were no, or scarce findings of cholestasis in the other groups. These results indicate that an excessive administration of nonprotein calories in TPN contributes to the occurrence of cholestasis. In addition this animal model may be useful in investigating the etiology of cholestasis.\r"

The differences in CBZ recovery from gastric or intestinal fluid, in the presence or absence of Ensure were found to be statistically significant (p less than 0.05). The difference in dosage forms were statistically not discernible.

The incidence of anastomotic leaks was increased in patients undergoing total gastrectomy with no relation to the clinical stage or nutritional status. However, there was a close relationship between nutritional status and immunocompetence, lung complications, and infection. The nutritional indices which reliably predicted preoperatively the nutritional status of cancer patients were the serum protein concentrations including the serum albumin (Alb) and prealbumin (PA). The indices predicting postoperative complications were the Alb, PA, and total lymphocyte count. These results suggest that preoperative nutritional assessment can be beneficial for the prediction of postoperative complications.\r"

We conducted a randomized study in 10 healthy volunteers (5 men, 5 women, age 22-30 yr). From 8:00 am of the first study day until 4:00 pm of the next day, either a standardized normal meal or a liquid polymer diet (Fresubin) was given orally at 8:00 am, noon, and 6:00 pm. In a third experiment, a liquid hydrolysed diet (Survimed OPD) was continuously applied to the duodenum using a portable pump. Daily caloric intake and main nutrient components were comparable in all three diets. From 2:00 pm of the first day until 4:00 pm of the next day, an intragastric pH-metry was performed with a combined glass pH-electrode in the gastric corpus. Median pH-values from predefined time periods (whole day, prandial, interdigestive, nocturnal) were compared between the three groups. The orally applied liquid polymer diet led to a significantly stronger increase in 24-hr and prandial gastric pH than the normal diet. Twenty-four-hr, interdigestive, and nocturnal pH-median values were significantly higher during continuous intraduodenal application of the liquid hydrolysed diet than during the normal diet.\r"

Feeding bags, which were on continuous pumps in patient-occupied rooms, were rinsed and refilled every 8 hours, and formula cultures were obtained at 0, 24, and 48 hr. Acceptability of cultures was based on published recommended standards. Low levels of nonpathogenic staphylococci were found in sterile water bags; high levels of bacilli and Gram negative rods were found in tap water bags. No significant differences were found in the relationship between type of formula diluent and outcomes. Type of water diluent and acceptability were not related. There was a systematic relationship between length of use and outcome; with both diluents, bags used over 24 hr became unacceptably contaminated. Further study with a larger sample is needed to determine the effects of using tap water rather than sterile water as diluent.\r"

Intravenous MCT are readily utilizable energy source because they reach the liver rapidly and their medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are oxidized through carnitine-independent mechanisms. However the MCFA can also be deviated to alternative oxidation pathways which results in urinary excretion of metabolites. The metabolic effects of intravenous MCT containing fat emulsions are discussed and emphasis is given in the possible role of these fats in parenteral nutrition of preterm infants, who are carnitine depleted. Directions of future research are speculated.\r"

  ".W": "The use of small amounts of a dilute solution of heparin (less than or equal to 100 IU) to keep indwelling intravenous needles or catheters patent for intermittent venous access either for intravenous therapy or timed blood sampling is a common clinical practice. It is considered safe since the amount of heparin required is much less than that required for heparinization. Herein, we describe a 13-yr-old patient with malabsorption who developed clinically significant bleeding shortly after a diagnostic test which required multiple small injections of heparin for intermittent venous access (total amount of heparin administered was 600 units over 5 hr). The coagulopathy was corrected by a single dose (10 mg) of parenteral vitamin K. As our patient had multiple risk factors for the development of vitamin K deficiency including malabsorption, decreased food intake, and antibiotic use, we postulate that the small amount of heparin precipitated the coagulopathy by increasing the antiprotease activity of antithrombin III on abnormal factors X and II formed in the vitamin K deficient state. We would therefore recommend administration of vitamin K to patients who are at risk of developing vitamin K deficiency before using even small amounts of heparin.\r"

Nasal bridles, however, are still not routinely used in nasoenteral feeding of patients who dislodge their feeding tubes. Instead, percutaneous gastrostomies and parenteral nutrition are increasingly being used in these patients who may otherwise be fed adequately with a secured nasoenteral tube. The newly designed nasal bridle described herein has the advantages of easy and rapid placement. Use of this bridle can promote safer and more effective enteral feeding while avoiding the complications and cost of parenteral nutritional and gastrostomies.\r"

This epitope is abundant on cell surface glycoconjugates of non-primate mammals, prosimians, and New World monkeys. It is not found on cells of Old World monkeys, apes, and man because of diminished alpha 1----3 galactosyltransferase enzyme activity. However, the alpha 1----3 galactosyltransferase gene seems to be present within the human genome. A mechanism that increases alpha 1----3 galactosyltransferase activity in human cells could trigger an autoimmune process mediated by anti-Gal binding to the newly synthesised alpha-galactosyl epitopes.\r"

Fluorescence images of the tumors were obtained with a newly developed endoscopic television system for detecting faint fluorescence. Computer-assisted processing was used to enhance the detection and localization of the tumors visualized by the immunofluorescent technique. Twenty seven (90%) of 30 tumors showed positive fluorescence after treatment with FITC-labeled antibodies for 60 minutes, whereas only two (40%) of five cancers could be detected by the immunofluorescent technique after treatment with antibodies for less than 60 minutes. There was no significant relationship between positive fluorescence and the gross and histological types or the stages of the tumors. In contrast, no positive fluorescence could be demonstrated in cases of benign gastric lesions or after pretreatment with FITC-labeled alpha-fetoprotein. This study therefore suggests that the immunofluorescent technique using FITC-labeled anti-CEA antibodies can be useful in detecting the early stages of gastric cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues administered for the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer induce a transient increase in plasma testosterone levels during the first week of treatment, often with a secondary rise in plasma levels of prostatic acid phosphatase and a flareup of disease. To determine whether the antiandrogen nilutamide (Anandron) blocks these effects, we carried out a multicenter, placebo-controlled study of nilutamide in men with prostatic cancer treated with the GnRH analogue buserelin. Thirty-six men with disseminated prostatic cancer and elevated plasma levels of prostatic acid phosphatase were randomly assigned to two groups. Group 1 included 17 men who received buserelin (500 micrograms daily subcutaneously) and nilutamide (300 mg daily by mouth); group 2 included 19 men treated with buserelin and placebo. Symptoms were assessed, and plasma was collected before treatment, daily for 14 days, and on days 18, 22, and 29 after the initiation of treatment. Bone pain appeared or worsened in 5 of the 17 men in group 1 and in 12 of the 19 men in group 2 (P less than 0.05). Acute urinary obstruction occurred in one man in group 2. Despite similar changes in the plasma testosterone levels in both groups, the median concentration of plasma prostatic acid phosphatase decreased almost immediately in group 1, but increased transiently, then decreased on day 14 in group 2. Median levels of prostate-specific antigen decreased immediately in group 1 and decreased on day 8 in group 2. We conclude that nilutamide can prevent the adverse consequences of the buserelin-induced transient rise in plasma testosterone levels in men with advanced prostate cancer treated with a GnRH analogue.\r"

All 603 men received leuprolide, an analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone that inhibits the release of gonadotropins, in combination with either placebo or flutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen that inhibits the binding of androgens to the cell nucleus. As compared with the 300 patients receiving leuprolide and placebo, the 303 patients randomly assigned to receive leuprolide and flutamide had a longer progression-free survival (16.5 vs. 13.9 months; P = 0.039) and an increase in the median length of survival (35.6 vs. 28.3 months; P = 0.035). The differences between the treatments were particularly evident for men with minimal disease and good performance status; however, further studies should be conducted in this subgroup. Symptomatic improvement was greatest during the first 12 weeks of the combined androgen blockade, when leuprolide alone often produces a painful flare in the disease. We conclude that in patients with advanced prostate cancer, treatment with leuprolide and flutamide is superior to treatment with leuprolide alone.\r"

Antibodies in 74 of these sera were inhibited by more than 50% from binding to human muscle AChR by a rat monoclonal antibody (mAb) of \"main immunogenic region\" (MIR) specificity. The mAb inhibition was not explainable by epitope competition because (1) the mAb was reactive with both Torpedo and human AChR, but antibodies in 85 of the MG sera did not bind to Torpedo AChR, and (2) the mAb blocked binding of rat anti-peptide antibodies to an alpha subunit region of the human AChR unrelated antigenically to the designated MIR region. Individual patients' sera had evidence of extensive antibody heterogeneity and revealed interspecies polymorphisms in AChR antigenicity, near and remote from the neurotransmitter-binding region. The data challenge the concept that a MIR of the AChR is the principal stimulus for antibody production in MG and emphasize a potential pitfall in assuming seronegativity in MG on the basis of a single assay system.\r"

Patients with cervical cultures positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae at their initial prenatal visit had endocervical specimens for Chlamydia trachomatis culture obtained before anti-gonorrheal therapy. Control patients were selected at random from the same prenatal population. The prevalence of C trachomatis in patients with gonorrhea was significantly greater than that in the control population (46 versus 5%; P less than .001). Patients with gonorrhea were younger, less often married, and more often black than the control population, but these demographic differences did not account for the large difference in the chlamydial prevalence. Erythromycin 500 mg four times daily provided an excellent cure rate without intolerable side effects. Pregnant patients being evaluated or treated for gonorrhea should also be considered at high risk for concomitant cervical chlamydial infection.\r"

Our data demonstrated that ultrasonography and optical density analyses were comparable in the evaluation of the isoimmunized pregnancy. The combined information from both these modalities did not increase the predictive value over that observed with either one alone. Both instruments were found to have high negative predictive values. However, neither method, used singly or in combination, was highly predictive of neonatal complications. In light of the low positive predictive values, caution should be exercised in using the results of amniotic fluid spectral analyses and/or ultrasound examinations for predicting perinatal complications.\r"

Although usually pyogenic in origin, parasitic infections account for a small percentage of cases. We report here the association of pregnancy and appendicitis caused by Schistosoma japonicum. Schistosomiasis is a very common complication of pregnancy, with 250,000,000 persons infected worldwide, including 20% of pregnant women living in hyperendemic areas. Schistosome egg masses can lodge throughout the body and cause acute inflammation of the appendix, fallopian tube, liver, and spleen. Congestion of pelvic vessels during pregnancy facilitates passage of eggs into the villi and intervillous spaces, causing an inflammatory reaction. Fetal anoxia and subsequent death has been attributed to heavy infestation of the placenta. Tourism, far-ranging military actions, and immigration make this disease a potential challenge for practitioners everywhere.\r"

The plasma estradiol (E2) level was 65 pg/mL in one woman before medication, and in the other increased from below 25 to 130 pg/mL after large doses of clomiphene citrate treatment. The pituitary tissues removed by transsphenoidal surgery showed hyperplasia with numerous cells immuno-histochemically positive for LH and FSH. After surgery, the elevated plasma gonadotropins decreased and plasma E2 levels increased. Human menopausal gonadotropin after clomiphene citrate treatment induced ovulation in one patient, and cyclic administration of estrogen and progesterone induced ovulation in the other.

Two healthy, fertile, asymptomatic men with hyperprolactinemia are reported. Both men had normal puberty. Both were euthyroid and had normal gonadotropin levels and androgen profiles. Semen analyses were normal and both had fathered children. The serum PRL level (mean +/- standard error of the mean) (N = 5) of subject 1 was 48 +/- 12 ng/mL, and of subject 2 was 214 +/- 5 ng/mL. Sella turcica computed tomography scans with contrast were normal. The two subjects underwent a thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test. Serum PRL and TSH were measured by radioimmunoassay. At time 0 and at 15 minutes, PRL bioactivity was measured in the Nb2 node rat lymphoma assay. Both subjects showed a normal TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Subject 1 had baseline PRL immunoactivity and bioactivity measuring 41 and 50 ng/mL, respectively, peaking at 76 and 70 ng/mL 15 minutes after infusion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Subject 2 had baseline PRL immunoactivity of 200 ng/mL and bioactivity of 67 ng/mL, neither of which were altered by infusion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Administration of L-dopa decreased the serum PRL of subject 1 from 33 to 7 ng/mL, but had no clinically significant effect in subject 2. Prolactin and gonadotropin secretion may be dissociated in men so that hyperprolactinemia may not always manifest as reproductive dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Using rigorous statistical methods, we have identified and evaluated unusual properties of the distribution of charged residues within the sequences of eukaryotic cellular transcription factors. Virtually all transcription factors, including GAL4, c-Jun, C/EBP, CREB, Oct-1, Oct-2, Sp1, Egr-1, CTF-1, steroid and thyroid hormone receptors, and others, carry one or more highly significant charge clusters. For the most part these clusters (conserved within families of homologous proteins) are of positive net charge but contain also substantial numbers of acidic residues. Predominantly basic charge clusters are often, but not exclusively, associated with DNA-binding domains, and vice versa. Negative charge clusters of note occur only in the yeast protein PHO4 and in the proteins encoded at the Drosophila loci zeste (zeta) and knrl. This dearth of statistically significant negative charge clusters raises questions with respect to the generality of acidic activation domains. A number of sequences (Oct-1, Oct-2, zeste, Dhr23, E75, and knrl) contain multiple charge clusters together with one or more significantly long uncharged regions. The occurrence of multiple charge clusters is a rare phenomenon (found in less than 3% of all proteins, mainly in Drosophila developmental control proteins and in transactivators of eukaryotic DNA viruses). Most of the proteins with zinc-binding \"fingers\" carry a mixed charge cluster centered at the zinc-finger motif preceded by a long uncharged stretch, suggestive of a modular structure for these proteins.\r"

Current methods for generation of monoclonal antibodies do not efficiently survey the immunological repertoire and, therefore, they limit the number of catalysts that can be obtained. We are exploring methods to clone and express the immunological repertoire in Escherichia coli. As the essential first step, we present here a method for the establishment of a highly diverse heavy chain variable region library. Consequently, it should now be possible to express and recombine the heavy and light chain variable region fragments to generate a large array of functional combining portions of the antibody molecule. This technology may provide an alternative to the hybridoma methodology for accessing the monoclonal antibody specificity of the immune system.\r"

We report that the cDNA sequence of pLsGT, in a transient expression assay in COS-7 cells, codes for an enzymatically active GT protein. There is an approximately 12-fold increase in the GT activity in pLsGT-transfected cells compared to cells transfected with the antisense bovine GT construct, pLasGT, or pSV2Neo or mock-transfected cells. The increased activity is correlated with the increase in bovine GT mRNA, which is distinguishable from COS GT mRNA with a 3'-end-specific probe of pLsGT. The expressed GT activity is modulated by alpha-lactalbumin, which changes the acceptor specificity to glucose to synthesize lactose. Polyclonal antibody raised against SDS/PAGE-purified bovine milk GT and a monoclonal antibody (mAb 4-10) directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal region of the protein encoded by pLsGT bind the expressed protein, and the resulting immunoprecipitates exhibit GT enzymatic activity.\r"

However, a mutant lacking cyanobacterial carboxylase could be obtained by replacing the natural carboxylase gene with the corresponding gene from Rhodospirillum rubrum, a photosynthetic anaerobe. This treatment produced an organism whose growth depended on the activity of the structurally and functionally dissimilar foreign carboxylase. As a further consequence of this mutagenic replacement, the mutant also lacked microscopically observable carboxysomes, the subcellular inclusion bodies in which the wild-type carboxylase naturally resides. The mutant, dependent on a carboxylase with an inferior relative specificity for CO2 versus O2 and apparently lacking carboxysomes, is extremely sensitive to the CO2/O2 ratio supplied during growth and is unable to grow at all in air. This response to the gas composition should prove useful for selection of various R. rubrum carboxylase mutants with altered specificities for CO2 and O2.\r"

RNAs containing the regulatory sequences are transcribed in vitro from oligonucleotide templates, biotinylated, and incubated with unfractionated cytosol. Specific RNA-protein complexes are bound in solution to avidin, and the resulting complex is bound to biotin-agarose beads. The cytosolic binding protein is released from the RNA in high salt, and a second round of purification yields an essentially homogeneous protein. Using this method, we have identified the protein in human liver that binds iron-responsive RNA regulatory sequences. Iron-responsive elements (IREs) are RNA stem-loops present in the mRNAs encoding ferritin and the transferrin receptor. IREs form the basis for the translational regulation of ferritin gene expression and the regulation of transferrin receptor mRNA degradation rates. The IRE binding protein purified by this technique migrates as a 90-kDa polypeptide on SDS/PAGE. The interaction of the purified protein with IRE-containing RNAs can be detected by gel-mobility shift assays or by covalent crosslinking induced by UV irradiation.\r"

  ".U": "89345561\r", 
  ".W": "Agents that act as anion channel blockers (ACBs) and do not permeate cells appear to inhibit exocytosis in platelets, parathyroid cells, and neutrophils. Based in large part on these observations, anion influx through plasma membrane channels has been considered a factor controlling cellular secretion, but there have been no direct anion influx measurements in cells or granules to support this concept. We have found that ACBs inhibit only thrombin-induced platelet secretion, not secretion induced by ADP, collagen, or A23187. ACBs inhibit thrombin esterolytic activity, binding of thrombin to platelets, and thrombin-stimulated platelet production of malondialdehyde in proportion to the degree of inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet secretion. Thus inhibition of platelet secretion by ACBs is due to inactivation of the stimulatory agonist, thrombin, and not to interference with cellular secretion per se. We have also found that previously reported inhibition of secretion of parathyroid cells and neutrophils by ACBs can be explained by the ability of ACBs to interfere with detection of the cellular secretory products that were measured to assess exocytosis. Our measurements of parathyroid hormone and beta-glucuronidase in the presence of ACBs were reduced to the same degree as the reported reduction in apparent cellular secretion produced by these agents. We conclude that plasma membrane anion channels of the type that can be blocked by ACBs such as 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, suramin, and probenecid do not participate in cellular secretory processes. Whether other types of anion channels exist that are not affected by these ACBs and whether there are mechanisms of anion flux during secretion not dependent on channels remain open questions.\r"

  ".U": "89345563\r", 
  ".W": "Pyrularia thionin, isolated from nuts of Pyrularia pubera, is a strongly basic peptide of 47 amino acids. The amino acid sequence and configuration of its four disulfide bonds place this plant peptide, known to be hemolytic, cytotoxic, and neurotoxic, among the thionins. We report and compare several cellular responses mediated by Pyrularia thionin: hemolysis of human erythrocytes, activation of an endogenous phospholipase A2 in Swiss 3T3 cells, cytotoxicity toward HeLa and mouse B16 melanoma cells in culture, viability of rat hepatocytes and lymphocytes measured by trypan blue exclusion, and lethality in mice. Cellular responses related to ion movement include a toxin-mediated influx of Ca2+ into mouse P388 cells measured by Fura-2 fluorescence, depolarization of mouse P388 plasma membrane measured by fluorescence of bis(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol (bisoxonol), and depolarization of frog (Rana pipiens) sartorius muscle determined by direct measurement of membrane potential. Graded iodination of Pyrularia thionin leads to a related loss of activity for hemolysis, phospholipase A2 activation, cytotoxicity, and lethality in mice. The mediated Ca2+ influx into and depolarization of P388 cells require Ca2+ in the external medium and are inhibited by 100 microM Ni2+. Depolarization of sartorius muscle by Pyrularia thionin also requires a functional Ca2+ channel, as shown by verapamil inhibition. This muscle depolarization also involves phospholipase A2 activation because dexamethasone and quinacrin, but not indomethacin, protect against depolarization. The IC50 values for viability of rat hepatocytes and splenic lymphocytes measured by trypan blue exclusion were 0.17 and 40 microM, respectively. The general response of cells to Pyrularia thionin involves a membrane alteration leading to depolarization and a channel-mediated influx of Ca2+. There is a related activation of phospholipase A2 that results in loss of membrane integrity, hemolysis in the case of erythrocytes, and eventually cell death. Iodination of Pyrularia thionin leads to a corresponding inhibition of all three cellular responses, which indicates an essential role for tyrosine in either maintenance of peptide structure or interaction of the peptide with cellular membranes.\r"

  ".W": "During fetal development, murine and human B-lineage cells rearrange and express a highly restricted set of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (VH genes). We noted that a VH gene of the restricted human fetal repertoire, designated 51p1, potentially could encode the VH region of two human IgM rheumatoid factor proteins. These rheumatoid factors share a cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) defined by reactivity with G6, a murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes an antibody heavy chain determinant present on many human IgM autoantibodies, particularly rheumatoid factors. Recently, we found that the G6 CRI also is expressed frequently by neoplastic CD5 (Leu1) B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma. However, neoplastic CD5-negative B cells from patients with lymphomas of follicular center cell origin rarely express this CRI. Here, we report that G6-reactive leukemic cells from two unrelated CLL patients express a VH gene that shares greater than 99% homology with a rearranged VH gene previously isolated from the leukemic cell DNA of another CLL patient and that is identical to VH 51p1. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we find that this VH gene is rearranged, and presumably expressed, in the genomic DNA of all examined cases of G6-reactive CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Thus these data indicate that the autoantibody-associated G6 CRI is a serologic marker for a conserved and developmentally restricted VH1 gene that is expressed at high frequency in CD5 B-cell malignancies and early B-cell ontogeny.\r"

Injection of mice with control FDC-P1 cells led to comparable organ engraftment, but the mice developed none of these lesions.

  ".W": "We have examined the role of a cell surface galactosyltransferase, laminin, and laminin-binding protein (receptor) in the invasion of clonal derivatives of a murine adrenal carcinoma cell line. Although a 10-fold variation was found in the ability to invade a reconstituted basement membrane matrix, levels of intracellular laminin and the laminin-binding protein were shown to be present and secreted equally in all lines. Of the eight lines tested, seven showed a correlation between invasion and the incorporation of [3H]galactose from UDP-[3H]galactose into a 90- to 110-kDa protein. One noninvasive line (clone HSR), however, retained high galactosyltransferase activity yet could not galactosylate the endogenous 90- to 110-kDa substrate. Interestingly, this clone was unable to attach to laminin. Although high galactosyltransferase activity can be consistent with cells of high invasiveness, our results suggest that the galactosylation status of a 90- to 110-kDa Y1 cell surface glycoprotein is most indicative of invasion potential.\r"

  ".W": "Preparations of mammalian H+ pumps that acidify intracellular vesicles contain eight or nine polypeptides, ranging in size from 116 to 17 kDa. Biochemical analysis indicates that the 70- and 58-kDa polypeptides are subunits critical for ATP hydrolysis. The amino acid sequences of the major catalytic subunits (58 and 70 kDa) of the endomembrane H+ pump are unknown from animal cells. We report here the complete sequence of the 58-kDa subunit derived from a human kidney cDNA clone and partial sequences of the 70- and 58-kDa subunits purified from clathrin-coated vesicles of bovine brain. The amino acid sequences of both proteins strongly resemble the sequences of the corresponding subunits of the vacuolar H+ pumps of Archaebacteria, plants, and fungi. The archaebacterial enzyme is believed to use a H+ gradient to synthesize ATP. Thus, a common ancestral protein has given rise to a H+ pump that synthesizes ATP in one organism and hydrolyzes it in another and is highly conserved from prokaryotes to humans. The same pump appears to mediate the acidification of intracellular organelles, including coated vesicles, lysosomes, and secretory granules, as well as extracellular fluids such as urine.\r"

  ".W": "In this paper we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the phosphorylation of lipocortin 1, at threonine as well as at tyrosine residues, by a highly purified preparation of the EGF receptor. The phosphorylation of threonine residues is catalyzed by an enzyme that contaminates the receptor preparations, since crude extracts of A431 plasma membranes contain larger amounts of the threonine kinase than does the receptor preparation. Protein kinase P (2.5 ng) inhibits both threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of lipocortin 1 while greatly stimulating the autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Acetyllipocortin 1 is poorly phosphorylated at tyrosine residues by the EGF receptor kinase, but it becomes readily phosphorylated in the presence of polylysine. The most likely explanation for this observation is that there is an interaction between polylysine and acetyllipocortin that converts the latter into a suitable substrate for the EGF receptor. These and other experiments described in this paper point to a role of surface charges in the susceptibility of substrates to attach by protein kinases.\r"

The zinc finger, which is the second major nucleic acid-binding motif characterized to date, defines large multigene families in higher eukaryotes; we have isolated more than 100 Xenopus finger protein-encoding cDNAs and in this study we show that at least 10 of these clones share extensive sequence homologies in a region of more than 200 amino acids in the N-terminal nonfinger portion of the predicted proteins, which is connected to variable finger clusters. We refer to this element as a finger-associated boxes (FAX) domain. Cross-hybridization with human genomic DNA indicates that the finger-associated boxes domain is evolutionary conserved. Northern blot analysis shows that the corresponding genes are differentially expressed in the course of early Xenopus embryogenesis.\r"

Two ARF cDNAs, ARF1 and ARF3, were cloned from a human cerebellum library. Based on deduced amino acid sequences and patterns of hybridization of cDNA and oligonucleotide probes with mammalian brain poly(A)+ RNA, human ARF1 is the homologue of bovine ARF1. Human ARF3, which differs from bovine ARF1 and bovine ARF2, appears to represent a newly identified third type of ARF. Hybridization patterns of human ARF cDNA and clone-specific oligonucleotides with poly(A)+ RNA are consistent with the presence of at least two, and perhaps four, separate ARF messages in human brain. In vitro translation of ARF1, ARF2, and ARF3 produced proteins that behaved, by SDS/PAGE, similar to a purified soluble brain ARF. Deduced amino acid sequences of human ARF1 and ARF3 contain regions, similar to those in other G proteins, that are believed to be involved in GTP binding and hydrolysis. ARFs also exhibit a modest degree of homology with a bovine phospholipase C. The observations reported here support the conclusion that the ARFs are members of a multigene family of small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. Definition of the regulation of ARF mRNAs and of function(s) of recombinant ARF proteins will aid in the elucidation of the physiologic role(s) of ARFs.\r"

To assess the extent of expansion of specific clones among RA synovial fluid T cells, Southern blot analyses of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements were performed on 40 RA synovial fluid T-cell clones, as well as on both fresh and polyclonally activated T cells from RA synovial fluid, RA peripheral blood, and normal peripheral blood. Two of the clones had identical TCR rearrangement patterns, but the remainder were unique. The nonclonal RA T-cell samples showed the same pattern of TCR beta-chain rearrangement that was observed among normal peripheral blood T cells, indicating no dominant clonal T-cell population in these samples. It was noted that with sufficient exposure of autoradiograms of the Southern blots, discrete TCR gene rearrangements, representing in some cases common D beta J beta (D, diversity; J, joining) rearrangements, were evident in T cells from peripheral blood of normal individuals and patients with RA, as well as T cells from RA synovial fluid. Taken together, the findings indicate that only a minor degree of oligoclonality can be demonstrated among T lymphocytes from RA synovial fluid.\r"

  ".W": "The autoimmune dermatologic disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is associated with the serotypes HLA-DR4 and HLA-DRw6. Based on nucleotide sequence and oligonucleotide probe analysis of enzymatically amplified DNA encoding HLA-DR beta chain (HLA-DRB) and HLA-DQ beta chain (HLA-DQB; henceforth HLA is omitted from designations), we showed previously that the DR4 susceptibility was associated with the Dw10 DRB1 allele [encoding the mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC)-defined Dw10 specificity]. The DRw6 susceptibility similarly was shown to be associated with a rare DQB allele (DQB1.3), which differed from another nonsusceptible allele by only a valine-to-aspartic acid substitution at position 57. Given the linkage disequilibrium that characterizes HLA haplotypes, it is difficult to assign disease susceptibility to a specific locus rather than to a closely linked gene(s) on the same haplotype. To address this problem, we have analyzed all of the polymorphic loci of the class II HLA region (DRB1, DRB3, DQA, DQB, and DPB) on the DRw6 haplotypes in patients and controls. In 22 PV patients, 4 different DRw6 haplotypes were found that encode the same DQ beta chain (DQB1.3) but contained silent nucleotide differences at the DQB locus as well as coding sequence differences in the DQA and DRB loci. These results, obtained by using a method for allele-specific polymerase chain reaction amplification, strongly support the hypothesis that the allele DQB1.3 confers susceptibility. This DQB allele is correlated with the MLC-defined Dw9 specificity and is associated with two different DRB1 alleles (the common \"6A\" associated with DRw13 and the rare \"6B\" associated with DRw14). Since 86% (19 of 22) of DRw6+ patients contain the DQB1.3 allele (vs. 3% of controls), whereas 64% (14 of 22) contain the DRB1 allele 6B (vs. 6% of the controls), we conclude that most of the DRw6 susceptibility to PV can be accounted for by the DQ beta chain.\r"

We have coupled the sevenless promoter to the reporter gene lacZ and have examined the pattern of beta-galactosidase expression in the developing eyes of transgenic larvae. Our results indicate that the dynamic pattern of sevenless protein expression is regulated transcriptionally. Promoter sequences located 5' of the coding region are insufficient for the wild-type level of gene expression but appear to be able to confer the correct pattern of expression. In contrast, enhancer sequences within the body of the gene can confer both the correct pattern and a normal level of expression on either the sevenless promoter or heterologous promoters. Thus the complex pattern of sevenless expression is redundantly encoded within proximal promoter sequences and enhancer elements internal to the gene but relies on these enhancer sequences for correct quantitative expression.\r"

Telomeres are added to the ends of each gene-sized molecule and each is amplified, mostly by approximately 1000-fold, to yield a transcriptionally active macronucleus. As a part of the study of the excision of genes from chromosomes, we have cloned six fragments of chromosomal DNA from Oxytricha nova, each containing a full copy of an actin gene, for comparison with the structure of the actin-encoding DNA molecule in the macronucleus. All six micronuclear actin clones had the same overall organization as judged by restriction mapping. Two micronuclear actin clones were sequenced. These differ from one another at a few nucleotide positions but both prescribe precisely the same actin polypeptide. Both micronuclear actin genes contain nine exons separated by eight intron-like sequences. The macronuclear gene contains these nine exons without intron-like segments. Assigning the order 1 through 9 to the nine micronuclear exons, the order in the macronucleus is 8-7-1-2-4-3-5-9-6. In the micronuclear actin gene, all nine exons possess terminal repeat sequences. These repeat sequences provide precise directions for reordering and joining of the nine exons to yield the exon order in the macronuclear gene. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of micronuclear DNA of the related species, Oxytricha trifallax, shows that the actin gene has an unorthodox arrangement in this species also.\r"

We report a series of experiments that assess which amino acids of the class II molecule I-Ak are required for coupling it to the signal-transduction pathway. We prepared a series of B-lymphocyte transfectants that express I-Ak molecules with COOH-terminal truncations of either the Ak alpha or Ak beta chain or both. The ability of each transfected class II molecule to transduce a signal after being bound by monoclonal antibody was found by monitoring the translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the \"nuclear compartment\" of the transfected B lymphocyte. Results indicate that the Ak beta chain plays the dominant role in signal transduction and that the 6 cytoplasmic amino acids of Ak beta chain most proximal to the inner plasma membrane are of greatest importance in coupling I-Ak molecules to the molecules of the signaling cascade.\r"

  ".W": "T lymphocytes express a tyrosine protein kinase (TPK; protein-tyrosine kinase; ATP:protein-tyrosine O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.112), pp56lck that is encoded by the lck protooncogene. This TPK was recently found to be associated with the intracellular domain of the T-cell surface glycoproteins, CD4 and CD8, suggesting that it plays an important role in T-cell development and activation. We have studied the regulation of pp56lck and found that this kinase can be rapidly activated by an endogenous mechanism present in T-lymphocyte membranes. This activation was sensitive to sodium orthovanadate and O-phosphotyrosine, consistent with the involvement of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase; protein-tyrosine-phosphatase; protein-tyrosine-phosphate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.48) in pp56lck activation. Based on a recent report demonstrating that CD45, the leukocyte common antigen, is a membrane-bound PTPase, we analyzed its role in pp56lck activation. CD45 was found to be the major (greater than 90%) PTPase in membranes of the murine T-lymphoma line BW5147. Moreover, activation of pp56lck was undetectable in a mutant BW5147 line lacking CD45 expression (and the associated PTPase activity). In contrast, activation of pp56lck was readily detected in the wild-type lymphoma line. More important, when immunoprecipitated CD45 was added to pp56lck, the TPK activity of the latter increased greater than 2-fold within minutes. This effect of CD45 was completely blocked by sodium orthovanadate. These findings indicate an important role for the CD45 PTPase in pp56lck activation. This role could be mediated by direct dephosphorylation of a regulatory tyrosine residue in pp56lck.\r"

Some of the metallopeptides thus obtained proved to be highly active LH-RH agonists or antagonists. For instance, SB-40, a PtCl2-containing metallopeptide in which platinum is coordinated to an N epsilon-(DL-2,3-diaminopropionyl)-D-lysine residue [D-Lys(DL-A2pr] at position 6, showed 50 times higher LH-releasing potency than the native hormone.

Most metallopeptide analogues of LH-RH showed high affinities for the membrane receptors of rat pituitary and human breast cancer cells. Some of these metallopeptides had cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer and prostate cancer cell lines in vitro (this will be the subject of a separate paper on cytotoxicity evaluation). Such cytostatic metallopeptides could be envisioned as targeted chemotherapeutic agents in cancers that contain receptors for LH-RH-like peptides.\r"

  ".W": "The nitrogen mustard derivatives of 4-phenylbutyric acid and L-phenylalanine, called chlorambucil (Chl) and melphalan (Mel), respectively, have been incorporated into several peptide hormones, including luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH). The alkylating analogues of LH-RH were prepared by linking Chl, as an N-acyl moiety, to the complete amino acid sequence of agonistic and antagonistic analogues. These compounds, in particular the antagonistic analogues, showed much lower potency than their congeners carrying other acyl groups. To obtain highly potent alkylating analogues of LH-RH, the D enantiomer of Mel was incorporated into position 6 of the native hormone and some of its antagonistic analogues. Of the peptides prepared, [D-Mel6]LH-RH (SB-05) and [Ac-D-Nal(2)1,D-Phe(pCl)2,D-Pal(3)3,Arg5,D-Mel6,D-Ala10++ +]LH-RH [SB-86, where Nal(2) is 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine and Pal(3) is 3-(3-pyridyl)alanine] possessed the expected high agonistic and antagonistic activities, respectively, and also showed high affinities for the membrane receptors of rat pituitary cells, human breast cancer cells, human prostate cancer cells, and rat Dunning R-3327 prostate tumor cells. These two analogues exerted cytotoxic effects on human and rat mammary cancer cells in vitro. Thus these two D-Mel6 analogues seem to be particularly suitable for the study of how alkylating analogues of LH-RH could interfere with intracellular events in certain cancer cells.\r"

Two lines showed no immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, whereas one allele was rearranged with breakpoints inside the switch region of the mu chain gene in the remaining four. These rearrangements had been generated by the translocation of different chromosome fragments to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene cluster-carrying 14q32 band in each of the four lines. Previously, a similar rearrangement was found in a fifth subline concurrently with a reciprocal 6;14 translocation. The transposed pieces have been derived from chromosomes 16 and 18 in two of the more recently rearranged lines. Their origins could not be determined in the remaining two lines, but they were different from each other and the other three 14q+ markers. The 14q+ marker-carrying variant has replaced its diploid progenitor suggesting that the translocation has conveyed some in vitro growth advantage on its carrier. This was also supported by the duplication of the 14q+ marker and the loss of its normal chromosome 14 homologue in one subline during serial culturing. The vulnerability of the switch region of the mu chain gene to illegitimate recombination at the pro-B stage and the possible relevance of this finding for the origin of the Burkitt lymphoma-associated 8;14 (immunoglobulin heavy chain gene cluster/MYC) translocation is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "89345678\r", 
  ".W": "To avoid large changes in cell K+ content and volume during variations in Na+,K+-ATPase activity, Na+-transporting epithelia must adjust the rate of K+ exit through passive permeability pathways. Recent studies have shown that a variety of passive K+ transport mechanisms may coexist within a cell and may be functionally linked to the activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase. In this study, we have identified three distinct pathways for passive K+ transport that act in concert with the Na+,K+-ATPase to maintain intracellular K+ homeostasis in the proximal tubule. Under control conditions, the total K+ leak of the tubules consisted of discrete Ba2+-sensitive (approximately 65%), quinine-sensitive (approximately 20%), and furosemide-sensitive (approximately 10%) pathways. Following inhibition of the principal K+ leak pathway with Ba2+, the tubules adaptively restored cell K+ content to normal levels. This recovery of cell K+ content was inhibited, in an additive manner, by quinine and furosemide. Following adaptation to Ba2+, the tubules exhibited a 30% reduction in Na+-K+ pump rate coupled with an increase in K+ leak by means of the quinine-sensitive (approximately 70%) and furosemide-sensitive (approximately 280%) pathways. Thus, the proximal tubule maintains intracellular K+ homeostasis by the coordinated modulation of multiple K+ transport pathways. Furthermore, these results suggest that, like Ba2+, other inhibitors of K+ conductance will cause compensatory changes in both the Na+-K+ pump and alternative pathways for passive K+ transport.\r"

The chronic sequelae of this infection include chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The development of safe and highly effective hepatitis B vaccines now provides the means by which HBV infection, including the HBV chronic carrier state, can be prevented and the related mortality significantly reduced. The cost of these vaccines has significantly decreased and will soon approach levels at which the cost-effectiveness (cost per death prevented) of hepatitis B vaccine will be similar to that of other childhood vaccines. Integration of hepatitis B vaccine into the Expanded Programme on Immunization for mass vaccination of infants in areas where HBV infection is endemic and morbidity is high would be the most effective means of providing the coverage necessary for effective control and prevention.\r"

The zinc finger is an independently folded domain with a compact globular structure in which the zinc atom is bound by two cysteine and two histidine ligands. The polypeptide backbone fold consists of a well-defined helix, starting as alpha and ending as 3(10) helix, packed against two beta strands that are arranged in a hairpin structure. A high density of basic and polar amino acid side chains on the exposed face of the helix are probably involved in DNA binding.\r"

A promoter sequence termed the sterol regulatory element (SRE) is essential for this repression. With the use of an oligonucleotide containing the SRE to screen a human hepatoma complementary DNA expression library, a clone for a DNA binding protein was isolated that binds to the conserved SRE octanucleotide in both a sequence-specific and a single-strand--specific manner. This protein contains seven highly conserved zinc finger repeats that exhibit striking sequence similarity to retroviral nucleic acid binding proteins (NBPs). We have designated the protein \"cellular NBP\" (CNBP). CNBP is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, is up regulated by sterols, and exhibits binding specificity that correlates with in vivo function. These properties are consistent with a role in sterol-mediated control of transcription.\r"

Both proteins contain a leucine zipper that is important for heterodimer formation. Peptides corresponding to these leucine zippers were synthesized. When mixed, these peptides preferentially form heterodimers over homodimers by at least 1000-fold. Both homodimers and the heterodimer are parallel alpha helices. The leucine zipper regions from Fos and Jun therefore correspond to autonomous helical dimerization sites that are likely to be short coiled coils, and these regions are sufficient to determine the specificity of interaction between Fos and Jun. The Fos leucine zipper forms a relatively unstable homodimer. Instability of homodimers provides a thermodynamic driving force for preferential heterodimer formation.\r"

Because hepatocytes (HC) occupy a position adjacent to KC in vivo, we investigated the influence of HC on KC tumoricidal activity. Using an in vitro assay of KC-mediated tumor cell cytostasis against murine P815 mastocytoma cells, we found that the presence of HC in the culture profoundly increased KC tumoricidal activity. HC enhanced KC inhibition of P815 proliferation and lowered the concentration of lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma necessary to activate the KC to a tumoricidal state. This stimulatory HC effect was dependent on the number of HC present and was transferable in cell-free supernatants, indicating that it was mediated by a soluble secreted product of HC. Furthermore, unlike other macrophage-priming or -potentiating factors, the transferable HC factor(s) was effective only if added simultaneously with lipopolysaccharide or interferon-gamma and not effective if added before these activating agents. These data show that HC produce a soluble mediator that enhances KC tumoricidal activity, suggesting that HC and KC interactions may be critical to the antitumor defense mechanisms of the liver.\r"

To investigate this, control dogs with end-to-side portacaval shunts (control-PCS, n = 6) were compared with dogs shunted 1 month after intraportal pancreatic islet autotransplantation (islet-Tx-PCS, n = 5). From the distal pancreas of each experimental dog, 1.95 +/- 0.49 X 10(5) islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and retransplanted within 3 hours. Assays of hepatocellular function (caffeine clearance) and hepatic blood flow (indocyanine green), conventional biochemical liver function tests, and glucose, insulin, and glucagon responses to intravenous glucose challenge were measured monthly and when dogs were killed. Four of six control-PCS dogs were killed 32 +/- 9 days after shunting because of more than 20% body weight loss; one control-PCS dog lost only 7% of body weight by day 56 and stabilized. No significant loss of body weight occurred in islet-Tx-PCS dogs (n = 5). Liver function test abnormalities seen in control-PCS dogs were absent in islet-Tx-PCS dogs. Both control-PCS and islet-Tx-PCS indocyanine green half-life measurements were significantly (p less than 0.05) prolonged at all times, indicating equally reduced hepatic blood flow after shunting for both groups. In contrast, islet-Tx-PCS caffeine half-life periods were significantly (p less than 0.05) shorter than in control-PCS dogs and were similar to those in normal dogs, indicating a protective effect of the transplanted islets on hepatocellular function. We conclude that intraportal pancreatic islet autotransplants prevent, by the local release of hepatotrophic factors within the liver, the metabolic abnormalities and loss of hepatic function after PCS.\r"

We found that serum F8Ag (ELISA) increased in the blood of rats subjected to skin burn (70 degrees C water to shaved dorsal skin for 30 seconds) but not in sham control rats (30 degrees C water). Coincidentally, F8Ag levels also decreased in lung and kidney tissue sections (immunofluorescent staining) of burned rats but not sham rats. Increases in circulating F8Ag levels and decreases in tissue F8Ag levels appeared to result from XO-derived O2* metabolites: F8Ag levels did not increase in the blood and did not decrease in the tissues of rats pretreated with allopurinol (a specific XO inhibitor, 50 mg/kg) or dimethylthiourea (DMTU) (a permeable O2* metabolite scavenger, 250 mg/kg). Lung injury as assessed by permeability studies (I125-albumin leak) paralleled changes in blood F8Ag levels in sham, burn, allopurinol-, and DMTU-treated groups. We conclude that skin burn causes a systemic vascular injury that can be inhibited by allopurinol or DMTU and is reflected by increased circulating and tissue decreased Factor VIII antigen levels. Release of Factor VIII antigen may serve as a valuable marker of distant organ injury in patients with skin burn.\r"

Segments of duodenum were studied in either the Ussing chamber or an isolated, vascularly perfused model. Adjacent mucosal sheets devoid of muscularis were studied in parallel Ussing chambers with exposure of the mucosal surface to 0 to 50 gm/dl dextrose or 0 to 20 gm/dl mannitol. The 5-HT response to hyperosmolar dextrose was measured in the presence of autonomic receptor blockers and tetrodotoxin. In the isolated, perfused duodenum, venous and luminal drainage were sampled during basal, dextrose-infusion, and recovery periods. 5-HT content was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. In chambered mucosal sheets the percentage of change in mucosal 5-HT release was a linear function of luminal dextrose (r = 0.96; p less than 0.05) or mannitol (r = 0.98; p less than 0.02) concentrations. A significant 65.8 +/- 19% inhibition of 5-HT release was observed for tetrodotoxin but not for atropine, hexamethonium, phentolamine, or propranolol. In the isolated, perfused duodenum, 50 gm/dl dextrose caused an integrated 5-HT venous response of 3.0 +/- 0.7 micrograms/100 gm (p less than 0.05 vs luminal or control venous release). It was therefore concluded that duodenal 5-HT release is concentration dependent for intraluminal glucose and mannitol, is partially neurally mediated by a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic pathway, and is predominantly into the venous drainage.\r"

A 3-day course of intramuscular FK 506 started on postoperative day 4 allowed 1- to 2-month survival. Delayed rejection in these baboons as well as in those treated daily for 90 days with FK could sometimes be reversed temporarily with a second 3-day course. The doses required for a good therapeutic effect were 10 times greater in baboons than in dogs, a finding that may reflect a species difference of lymphocyte sensitivity to this drug. FK appeared to be relatively nontoxic in subhuman primates, and it remains a promising drug for clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "Inadequate granulopoiesis and decreased granulocyte function are thought to play a significant role in the burned victim's susceptibility to infection. In an attempt to determine whether the regulatory granulopoietic growth factor G-CSF could favorably affect survival when used in combination with antibiotics, we examined survival in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa burn wound infection. One hundred twenty male BDF1 mice received a 15% total body surface area burn and were randomized to one of five treatment groups: (1) burn only, (2) burn + infection, (3) burn + infection + G-CSF, (4) burn + infection + gentamicin, and (5) burn + infection + G-CSF + gentamicin. Infected mice received a 10(3) colony-forming units topical inoculum of Pseudomonas to the wound immediately postburn. Gentamicin animals received 6.0 mg/kg intraperitoneal gentamicin as a single dose immediately postburn. G-CSF was administered as 100 ng twice daily for 7 days. All treatment groups showed improved survival compared with the burn + infection group, which showed 100% mortality by day 9 (p less than 0.001 all groups; Cox-Mantel statistic). Group 5 (burn + infection + G-CSF + gentamicin) exhibited improved survival as compared with either group 3 (burn + infection + G-CSF, p = 0.054) or group 4 (burn + infection + gentamicin, p = 0.007). The use of hematopoietic growth stimulants in combination with antibiotic therapy may result in improved outcome after burn injury, and it suggests new treatment options in the management of postburn infectious complications.\r"

  ".W": "The morbidly obese are known to have impaired respiratory function. A prospective study of the changes in lung volumes, carbon monoxide transfer, and arterial blood gas tensions was undertaken in 29 morbidly obese patients before and after surgery to induce weight loss. Before surgery the predominant abnormality in respiratory function was a reduction in lung volumes. These increased towards normal predicted values after weight loss, with significant increases in functional residual capacity, residual volume, total lung capacity, and expiratory reserve volume. The increases ranged from 14% for total lung capacity to 54% for expiratory reserve volume. After weight loss had been induced the smokers showed mild hyperinflation and air trapping. Resting arterial blood gas tensions improved, with a rise in arterial oxygen tension from 10.63 to 13.02 kPa and a fall in arterial carbon dioxide tension from 5.20 to 4.64 kPa. There was no correlation between weight loss and the changes in blood gas tensions or lung volumes. Loss of weight in the morbidly obese is thus associated with improved lung function. The effects of smoking on lung function could be detected after weight loss, but were masked before treatment by the opposing effects of obesity on residual volume and functional residual capacity.\r"

This therapy is exemplified by the case of a sixty-six-year-old man with hemophilia B and urinary retention. The patient was treated with daily subcutaneous injections of 1 mg of leuprolide acetate, and prostatic size decreased from 132 g to 42 g, with initiation of spontaneous micturition while on treatment. For patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia who are not candidates for surgery, treatment with an LH-RH agonist, such as leuprolide acetate, should be considered as a possible alternative.\r"

Consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic Bruce treadmill exercise who had not had a recent myocardial infarction or undergone coronary bypass graft surgery and who were not taking nitrates, beta-blockers, digoxin, or calcium antagonists were eligible. Seventy-eight patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria consented to participate. Of these 78, 13 developed chest pain necessitating exercise cessation and were randomized to either nitroglycerin or nifedipine. Nitroglycerin was initially given to seven patients and nifedipine to six patients. Complete pain relief was observed in five of seven (71 percent) nitroglycerin patients at two minutes postdose. At four minutes postdose, the remaining two nitroglycerin patients were essentially pain-free. At two minutes postdose, no patient receiving nifedipine had complete pain resolution, and only one patient (17 percent) had partial (greater than 50 percent) pain relief. At four minutes postdose, four of the nifedipine patients were crossed over to nitroglycerin. At two minutes after the nitroglycerin dose, all four patients had total pain relief. The remaining two nifedipine patients had partial pain relief and were not crossed over to nitroglycerin. Subjective side effects and changes in heart rate and blood pressure were not significantly different between nitroglycerin and nifedipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The starting dose of ifosfamide was 1.5 gm/m2 daily, intravenously, for 5 days. The starting dose of ifosfamide was reduced 1.2 gm/m2 daily in patients who had received prior radiotherapy. Mesna was given intravenously immediately and at 4 and 8 hours after the administration of ifosfamide. Each mesna dose was 20% of the total daily dose of ifosfamide. Twenty-nine patients are evaluable for toxicity, and 28 patients are evaluable for response. Twenty-one patients had received prior abdominal hysterectomy, and eight patients had prior radiotherapy. Thirteen tumors were homologous and 15 heterologous. Gynecologic Oncology Group grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia occurred in seven (25%) patients and two (7.1%) had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Two patients (7.1%) had grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity. One patient experienced lethargy and confusion that responded to discontinuation of the ifosfamide. A second patient developed progressive cerebellar dysfunction, left hemiparesis, and coma. This patient died after 3 days of therapy. Complete responses were seen in five (17.9%) patients and partial responses occurred in four (14.3%) patients for a total response rate of 32.2%. These results indicate that ifosfamide is an unusually active drug in patients with advanced or recurrent mixed mullerian tumors of the uterus. Studies with combination regimens incorporating ifosfamide are warranted. The toxicity of ifosfamide in Gynecologic Oncology Group studies is being evaluated retrospectively.\r"

Although one of the two formulas predicted hematocrit values significantly, the only component of the formula that made a significant contribution was fetal hydrops. We conclude that currently available fetal Doppler measurements are unable to be applied in the prospective prediction of hematocrit values in anemic fetuses of isoimmunized pregnancies.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether atrial natriuretic peptide is present in the human fetal circulation and changes in response to fetal blood volume expansion, the concentration of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was measured by radioimmunoassay in samples obtained by cordocentesis. Twenty-four patients referred for intravascular blood transfusion because of red cell isoimmunization at 21 to 35 weeks' gestation were studied. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations in fetal blood (median, 8.0 pmol/L; range, 1 to 27.3) were significantly higher than those of 25 young 18- to 32-year-old adult control subjects (median, 4.5 pmol/L; range, 1 to 11.3, p less than 0.002 but similar to those found in the umbilical cord blood of 10 normal neonates immediately after delivery (median, 7.35 pmol/L; range, 2.7 to 15.5). In seven patients in whom fetal and maternal plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was measured simultaneously, all fetal concentrations were higher (p less than 0.01). The concentration of fetal atrial natriuretic peptide before and immediately after blood transfusion (n = 12) rose significantly (p less than 0.05), and the rise correlated positively with the transfusion rate (p less than 0.05). We conclude that atrial natriuretic peptide is present in plasma of the human fetus as early as 21 weeks' gestation and that its concentration increases promptly in response to vascular volume expansion. These findings suggest that atrial natriuretic peptide may play a role in fetal volume homeostasis.\r"

We performed pulsed Doppler assessment of cardiac output in 13 severely isoimmunized fetuses before and after intravascular transfusion and compared the results with 37 control fetuses between 20 and 34 weeks' gestation. The cardiac index of the anemic fetuses was significantly greater than that of the control group. A significant (right ventricle, p less than 0.01; left ventricle, p less than 0.02) increase in indexed output was noted from both ventricles and in the combined ventricular output (mean +/- SEM 644 +/- 35.3 ml/kg/min in control fetuses versus 879 +/- 86.0 ml/kg/min in anemic fetuses, p less than 0.006). An increase in cardiac output was also noted when anemic fetuses were compared with gestational age-specific norms. We conclude that severely anemic fetuses of isoimmunized pregnancies tend to have significantly higher cardiac output than do unaffected fetuses and that this high output state may play a part in the development of hydrops fetalis.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating antibodies to negatively-charged phospholipids have been implicated in the genesis of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, it has yet to be established that these antibodies are causative or that they are invariably associated with untoward perinatal outcomes. To address this issue, the prevalence of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies was recorded in a low-risk obstetric population, and the outcome of untreated pregnancies were evaluated. Two of 737 patients (0.27%) had lupus anticoagulant documented by a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time that did not correct this mixing studies. In comparison, greatly elevated concentrations of immunoglobulin M-anticardiolipin antibodies or immunoglobulin G-anticardiolipin antibodies were identified in 16/737 (2.2%) patients by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Spontaneous abortions occurred in both lupus anticoagulant-positive patients, suggesting that the activated partial thromboplastin time used was a relatively insensitive but specific marker for antiphospholipid antibody-associated adverse pregnancy outcomes. In contrast, although 12 of 16 anticardiolipin antibodies-positive pregnancies were complicated by perinatal loss, preterm delivery, or fetal growth retardation, four patients had uncomplicated pregnancies. Moreover, the distribution of anticardiolipin antibodies concentrations in these four patients was not clustered among the lowest anticardiolipin antibodies values, and anticardiolipin antibodies concentrations correlated weakly with adverse outcomes. These findings suggest that antiphospholipid antibodies are related to adverse pregnancy outcomes in a complex fashion and that therapy is not always required for acceptable outcomes in patients without other risk factors.\r"

Thirty-two women developed hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg) that in 17 women was associated with proteinuria (greater than 0.3 gm/day). Fibronectin levels were 83% +/- 22% of normal (mean +/- SD) during the first trimester and 75% +/- 20% at term in the healthy women but increased from 94% +/- 36% to 187% +/- 36% in the women who developed gestational hypertension (with or without proteinuria) (p less than 0.0001). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels increased from 26 +/- 19 ng/ml to 110 +/- 86 ng/ml in healthy women and from 32 +/- 35 ng/ml to 290 +/- 90 ng/ml in hypertensive women (p less than 0.001). Increased levels of fibronectin at 25 to 36 weeks of pregnancy (greater than or equal to mean + 2 SD of the healthy women, or greater than 140%) were found in 31 of the 32 women with gestational hypertension with or without proteinuria and in 5 of the 88 healthy women (sensitivity 96%, specificity 94%). Fibronectin levels increased 3.6 +/- 1.9 weeks earlier than the onset of hypertension and/or proteinuria. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 at 25 to 32 weeks (greater than or equal to 280 ng/ml) were found in 16 of the 32 women who developed gestational hypertension with or without proteinuria and in 4 of the 88 healthy women (sensitivity 50%, specificity 95%). We conclude that increased fibronectin levels are the best predictor of gestational hypertension with or without proteinuria and that its level in plasma increases several weeks before the development of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The multiple physiologic effects of atrial natriuretic peptide are mediated through specific atrial natriuretic peptide plasma membrane receptors. We have attempted to determine whether atrial natriuretic peptide receptors are present in guinea pig placentas and subplacentas at approximately 45 and 65 days' gestation. A microsomal plasma fraction was prepared from each component. Atrial natriuretic peptide receptors were detected by in vitro radioligand techniques with alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide labeled with iodine 125. In placentas we identified one set of specific binding sites for atrial natriuretic peptide at both gestational ages. Although the maximal concentration of the receptors did not change with advancing gestation, the dissociation constant was higher at 65 than at 45 days' gestation. In subplacentas two sets of binding sites were identified, one of low capacity-high affinity and the other of low affinity-high capacity. The maximal concentration of the atrial natriuretic peptide receptors did not change as a function of gestation. However, the dissociation constant, for both the high- and low-affinity sites, significantly decreased with advancing gestation.\r"

Information for this analysis came from reviews of samples of patient records drawn at comparable periods before and after the geriatric NPs were employed. The measures of geriatric nurse practitioner impact were based on comparisons of changes from pre-NP to post-NP periods. Separate analyses were done for newly admitted and long-stay residents; a subgroup of homes judged to be best case examples was analyzed separately as well as the whole sample. Favorable changes were seen in two out of eight activity of daily living (ADL) measures: five of 18 nursing therapies; two of six drug therapies; six of eight tracers. There was some reduction in hospital admissions and total days in geriatric NP homes. Overall measures of medical attention showed a mixed pattern with some evidence of geriatric NP care substituted for physician care. These findings suggest that the geriatric NP has a useful role in nursing home care.\r"

Many patients with serious clinical pictures, including severe renal insufficiency and shock, were hospitalized; 11 died. Indirect fluorescent antibody tests with antigens of 4 hantaviruses (Hantaan, Fojnica, Puumala, and the Vranica strain of Puumala virus) showed that greater than 1 serotype was circulating during this epidemic.

Three hantaviruses, 2 from A. flavicollis and 1 from C. glareolus, were isolated directly in Vero E6 cells and were partially characterized. The isolates from A. flavicollis, designated Fojnica virus, were antigenically similar but not identical to Hantaan virus strain 76-118, whereas the isolate from C. glareolus was antigenically indistinguishable from Puumala virus, strain Hallnas B1. These data are consistent with previous studies that indicate the existence of at least 2 hantavirus serotypes in Yugoslavia.\r"

This pattern of susceptibility is opposite that reported for other stocks of this parasite. In a second experiment, C3H and B6 mice were infected ip or sc with 2 x 10(6), 10(6), 5 x 10(5), 10(5), or 10(3) Y strain BFTs. C3H mice infected ip with the 3 highest doses were again more resistant than the B6 mice, while mice infected ip with the 2 lowest doses were essentially equivalent in resistance. Thus, the difference in susceptibility was detectable, in terms of parasitemia levels and survival, primarily at the higher infection doses. For the groups infected sc, the pattern of susceptibility reversed. B6 mice infected with the 3 highest doses had lower parasitemia levels than the corresponding C3H mice, while C3H and B6 mice infected with 10(5) or 10(3) BFTs were similar in resistance. Blastogenic responses of lymphoid cells to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and a soluble trypanosome extract (STE) were compared for C3H mice infected ip or sc to determine if the susceptibility to infection obtained with the 2 routes would be associated with differences in immune responses. Mesenteric lymph node cells (MLNCs) of mice infected ip were responsive to the STE early in infection, while superficial lymph node cells (SLNCs) of these mice were not. C3H mice infected sc had SLNCs which yielded strong responses to STE, while their MLNCs were relatively unresponsive. PHA stimulated responses by lymphoid cells from mice infected ip or sc were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a house-to-house survey, greater than 91% of the sample population of 16,675 participated by providing stool and/or urine specimens which were examined qualitatively by Kato thick smear and sedimentation techniques, respectively. After the 1935 survey by Scott, the prevalence of S. mansoni appeared to change little, from 33% in 1935 to 39% in 1983, but a more sensitive diagnostic technique in 1983 strongly suggested that the actual prevalence had decreased between the 2 surveys. In contrast, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection decreased from 56% to 5%, with a similar decline in all 8 governorates. The dramatic decline in S. haematobium prevalence has been accompanied temporally with a sharp decrease in the population density of Bulinus truncatus. S. mansoni has become the predominant human schistosome species in the Nile Delta.\r"

Grade I consisted of echogenic bands usually with a diameter greater than 4 mm that were best visible in the area of the portal vein bifurcation and gallbladder neck. Frequently a continuous U-shaped echogenic structure extended from the left portal branch to the gallbladder bed. Grade II was characterized by echogenic bands usually greater than 10 mm in diameter around the central part and major branches of the portal vein. In addition to features common to grade II, grade III included streak-like fibrous bands that were not confined to portal vein lumina but extended into the periphery of the liver. Sonographical abnormalities encountered in children with S. mansoni infection differed significantly from those in adults.\r"

Tidal volume and respiratory frequency were held constant throughout the measurements. Hepatic artery blood flow (HABF) and portal vein blood flow (PVBF) were measured by electromagnetic flowmeters. Hepatic function was assessed by indocyanine green (ICG) elimination kinetic analysis after intravenous injection of the dye. Hypocapnia caused a decrease in HABF without affecting the systemic circulation. Hypercapnia, on the other hand, caused a significant increase in cardiac output without changing mean arterial pressure. There was a significant increase in PVBF and total hepatic blood flow (THBF = PVBF + HABF). Despite the increases in PVBF and THBF, the half-life of ICG was significantly longer during hypercapnia (9.09 +/- 0.79 min) than during hypocapnia (7.16 +/- 0.37 min), and plasma ICG clearance was smaller during hypercapnia (4.79 +/- 0.44 ml.min-1) than during hypocapnia (5.44 +/- 0.33 ml.min-1) or normocapnia (5.27 +/- 0.50 ml.min-1), indicating the depressed hepatic function during hypercapnia. We conclude that mild hypocapnia decreases HABF without affecting hepatic function and that mild hypercapnia is associated with a depression of hepatic function in spite of the increases in PVBF and THBF.\r"

In 18 dogs the left circumflex coronary artery was cannulated and perfused by arterial blood at a constant pressure. Coronary blood flow was measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter. Intracoronary aspirin at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg reduced coronary blood flow in a dose-dependent manner. Injection of aspirin at doses of 10 to 25 mg also inhibited reactive hyperemia following the coronary occlusion for fifteen seconds. The mean peak flow ratio was reduced from 2.13 +/- 0.42 to 1.75 +/- 0.35 (p less than 0.005). The increment of coronary blood flow provoked by intracoronary arachidonic acid at doses of 150 to 300 micrograms was almost entirely inhibited by the pretreatment of the coronary artery with aspirin. The authors conclude that aspirin increases coronary arterial resistance in a dose-dependent manner and also restricts the maximal dilating capacity, possibly by inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis.\r"

At virtually any probability of acute myocardial infarction, replacing more intensive by less intensive strategies saved money but increased mortality and decreased life expectancy. Therefore, choices among strategies may be made by using the most effective strategy for progressively lower and lower risk patients until the additional cost per additional life saved reaches a cutoff value; then, a less expensive strategy is selected. With sample cutoff values of $1 and $2 million per life saved, the marginal threshold admission probabilities were: (table; see text) These results imply that the acceptable proportion of false-positive admissions may be as high as 70% to 80%; lower rates could indicate excessively restrictive admitting policies.

Pathologic increases in endogenous plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) may blunt normal fibrinolysis and unmask alternate fibrinolytic mechanisms, such as elastase-induced fibrin degradation. We measured PAI-1 and elastase-induced fibrin(ogen) degradation products in 69 critically ill patients in our medical intensive care unit (MICU) and in nine healthy volunteers. Factor VIII-related antigen protein (VIII:Ag), a reported marker of acute lung injury, and alpha-1-protease inhibitor (alpha-1-PI), an acute phase reactant, were also measured. MICU patients included 24 control patients with no known risk of ARDS, 35 patients with risk factors for ARDS including sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, and shock, and 12 patients with ARDS including two patients from at-risk groups who developed ARDS. Plasma PAI-1 was determined by chromogenic assay, elastase-induced peptides by a new radioimmunoassay, VIII:Ag by immunoelectrophoresis, and alpha-1-PI by immunodiffusion. When compared to normal volunteers, MICU control patients had elevated PAI-1, VIII:Ag, elastase-induced peptides, and alpha-1-PI. Patients with ARDS had significantly higher PAI-1 and VIII:Ag than did MICU control patients; elastase-induced peptides and alpha-1-PI were not higher. However, at-risk patients who did not develop ARDS also had high PAI-1 or VIII:Ag. Although these data cannot refute the possible role of these compounds in the pathogenesis of ARDS, they demonstrate that PAI-1 and VIII:Ag may be elevated in many critically ill patients but may not be useful markers for the subsequent development of ARDS.\r"

There were large differences among the 13 individual instrumental mean values for both blood and FCE at the four levels: for PO2 (average range, 10.3 mm Hg for blood and 17.0 mm Hg for FCE) and PCO2 (average range, 9.4 mm Hg for blood and 6.2 mm Hg for FCE). Although the instrumental biases for blood and FCE were approximately the same, the biases were slightly higher for FCE in measuring PO2 and slightly higher for blood in measuring PCO2. Accuracy and precision in blood measurement and precision in FCE measurement were significantly correlated among instruments for PO2 and PCO2. The biases of the nine instrument models evaluated significantly correlated with those of the same models participating in national surveys. We suggest that differences in technique, maintenance, and instrumental design rather than inherent differences in PO2 and PCO2 electrodes probably account for the demonstrable differences between instruments. The fluorocarbon-containing emulsion used is of value in proficiency testing for PO2 and PCO2.\r"

In parallel, the same preparations were used to assess either the activation of promutagens, i.e., benzo(a)pyrene, 2-aminofluorene, cyclophosphamide, and a cigarette smoke condensate, to metabolites reverting his- Salmonella typhymurium strains, or the decrease of direct-acting mutagens, i.e., sodium dichromate, 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide, epichlorohydrin, and ICR 191. As compared to bronchus preparations, parenchymal preparations contained considerably higher concentrations of reduced glutathione, had a significantly higher epoxide hydrolase activity, and, as assessed by means of a quantitative index, were more efficient in activating 2-aminofluorene and in reducing the mutagenicity of dichromate and 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide. These data may suggest that parenchymal lung tissue is more capable than bronchial tissue to detoxify reactive intermediates of xenobiotics, possibly explaining the greater susceptibility of bronchi to cigarette smoke-induced cancers.\r"

  ".W": "The epithelial cell may contribute to the regulation of pulmonary function during inflammatory diseases of the airways by producing metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA). We have used human tracheal epithelial cells (HTE), grown in serum-free medium, to examine cyclooxygenase metabolism of endogenous AA by these cells. Gas chromatography-negative ion mass spectrometry demonstrated that, regardless of stimulus (buffer, bradykinin, or the calcium ionophore A23187), epithelial cells produce PGE2 and PGF2 alpha but no detectable levels of PGD2, thromboxane B2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, or 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2. Preincubation of cultures with medium containing 5% human serum led to striking increases in the production of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, regardless of stimulus. Concomitant with these increases in prostanoids, serum exposure caused a 3.6-fold increase in total cellular arachidonate. Arachidonate levels increased in all phosphoglyceride classes, with the greatest increases in phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositol. In serum-pretreated cells, PGE2 production was 1.46 +/- 0.12, 4.74 +/- 0.6, and 6.35 +/- 0.93 ng/10(6) cells (mean +/- SEM; n = 7) upon exposure to buffer, 10(-6) M bradykinin, and 1 micrograms/ml A23187, respectively, whereas PGF2 alpha levels were 1.53 +/- 0.22, 4.44 +/- 0.36, and 5.77 +/- 0.78 ng/10(6) cells, respectively. The response of HTE to bradykinin was dose-dependent (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) and was maximal within 5 min. We conclude that cyclooxygenase metabolism of endogenous arachidonate in HTE results in the specific production of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha. HTE in culture retain receptors for bradykinin and can be used to study lipid metabolism independent of other cell types.\r"

These patients, termed patients with \"bronchiolitis,\" underwent pulmonary function testing, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and open lung biopsy. Although lung biopsy findings varied somewhat among the patients, each biopsy contained a prominent component of bronchiolitis. Pulmonary function testing and BAL were also repeated after 3 months of treatment with oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). Initial BAL neutrophil percentages were significantly higher in the bronchiolitis group (54 +/- 10%) than in smokers with chronic bronchitis (3.9 +/- 1.0%) or in normal nonsmoking volunteers (0.8 +/- 0.5%) (p less than 0.01, both comparisons). Eleven of 15 patients with bronchiolitis had significant improvement (greater than or equal to 15% increase in FEV1) in their lung function after prednisone treatment. Furthermore, this \"responder\" subgroup had a significant reduction in BAL neutrophil percentages after treatment with prednisone (46 +/- 15% to 6 +/- 3%, p less than 0.05). Finally, the neutrophil products collagenase and myeloperoxidase were detected in the BAL fluid of patients with bronchiolitis. These findings suggest a central role for the neutrophil in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis and emphasize the utility of BAL in the identification of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "In C57BL/6N and C3H/HeN mice known to be free of all murine pathogens and matched for age, sex, microbiologic, and environmental factors, exposure to NO2 for 4 h prior to exposure to infectious aerosols of Mycoplasma pulmonis resulted in potentiation of murine respiratory mycoplasmosis (MRM). In the C57BL/6N mice, NO2 increased the incidence of death, incidence of gross lung lesions, and incidence of microscopic lung lesions, but did not increase the incidence of infection in the lungs. Nitrogen dioxide affected the C3H/HeN mice (a strain known to be more susceptible than the C57BL/6N strain to MRM) similarly, with the exception that the incidence of death and microscopic lesions were not affected in this strain at the concentrations of M. pulmonis used. Exposure to the oxidant also increased the severity of microscopic lesions and the numbers of Mycoplasma organisms in the lungs of both mouse strains. Thus, NO2 appeared to affect host lung defense mechanisms responsible for limiting the extent of infection. The NO2 exposure level required to produce potentiation varied with the genetic background of the host, the number of Mycoplasma organisms administered, and the end point measured. In further experiments in C57BL/6N mice, exposure to 5 or 10 ppm of NO2 for 4 h prior to infection with aerosolized, radiolabeled M. pulmonis reduced clearance of these organisms from the lungs over a 72-h time period. Nitrogen dioxide exposure did not change the rate of physical removal of Mycoplasma organisms from the lung. Reduced clearance was due to impaired intrapulmonary killing of Mycoplasma organisms in NO2-exposed mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The outlook for survival of mechanically ventilated children with a variety of chronic respiratory disorders has improved to an extent that forces reexamination of traditional views of what is in these children's best interest with respect to medical care. In the ICU setting, this kind of situation represents a major dilemma in current pediatric medical practice since both alternatives (prolonged mechanical ventilation versus withholding/withdrawing) imply an unfavorable outcome. Because the survival and quality of life for children receiving long-term assisted ventilation are not highly discouraging, increasing numbers of pediatric patients are not being managed at home with life-support technology. This article reviews medical data on the survival of children managed with mechanical ventilation and discusses some of the key ethical issues pertaining to decisions about withholding/withdrawing assisted ventilation in infants and children. In addition, we suggest the following guidelines and procedures that might be useful in dealing with the prolonged mechanical ventilation dilemma in pediatric medical practice: (1) obtain the correct facts on prognosis (good ethics start with good facts); (2) avoid irreversible decisions under uncertainty; (3) remember that withdrawing treatment is ethically preferable to withholding; (4) resolve disagreements with the use of outside consultation; (5) include the entire family in the decision-making process; (6) remember that consent is a process, not an event, and requires regular discussions with the family; (7) one physician must be identified as the primary provider and communicator.\r"

Age, mortality, service, length of stay, hospital charge, and projected DRG reimbursement were recorded. Patients whose hospital stay exceeded the maximum expected for their DRG were considered day outliers. The 51 study patients had a mean age of 59 +/- 17.6 years. They comprised 1.3 per cent of all patients in the SICU and 30.7 per cent of all SICU patient days during the study period. Mortality was 39.2 per cent. Thirty-two patients (62.7%) were day outliers. The mean hospital charge per patient was $59,552 while the mean projected DRG reimbursement was $10,435, for a total projected loss in billed charges of $2,504,428. DRG reimbursement for patients requiring prolonged SICU stay is inadequate to meet their charges and may severely limit future SICU use.\r"

  ".W": "There is very good evidence that screening for breast cancer reduces mortality in women older than 50 years and suggestive but inconsistent evidence that screening is effective in reducing long-term mortality in women younger than 50 years. The probability that an average-risk woman will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the coming 10 years is about 130 in 10,000 for a 40-year-old woman, 230 in 10,000 for a 55-year-old woman, and 280 in 10,000 for a 65-year-old woman. The chance of dying from breast cancer diagnosed in the coming 10 years is about 90 in 10,000, 123 in 10,000, and 120 in 10,000 for women age 40, 55, and 65, respectively. Mathematical models based on data from controlled trials of screening programs indicate that screening annually for 10 years with breast physical examination will decrease the probability of death from breast cancer by about 25 in 10,000 for women in the three age groups and increase life expectancy by about 20 days. Adding annual mammography will decrease the probability of death from breast cancer an additional 25 in 10,000 and increase life expectancy an additional 20 days. The actual reductions in mortality observed in controlled trials are slightly lower. If women are screened annually for 10 years with breast physical examination and mammography, the chance for a false-positive result over the 10-year period is approximately 2500 in 10,000. On the population level, if 25% of women age 40 to 75 are screened annually with both examinations, deaths from breast cancer would be decreased by about 4000 in the year 2000. Net annual costs would be approximately $1.3 billion. Recommending a screening strategy requires weighing the benefits against the risks and costs.\r"

More than 99% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by greater than or equal micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml; its MIC for 50% of strains tested ranged from greater than or equal to 0.06 to 1 micrograms/ml. Staphylococci, streptococci, Branhamella catarrhalis, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Bacillus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and the pathogenic Neisseria spp., including oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-producing strains, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, were also inhibited by Ro 23-9424. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., and Bacteroides fragilis group isolates were more refractory to Ro 23-9424 (the MIC for 90% of strains tested was less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). Overall, Ro 23-9424 inhibited 97% of the aerobic strains, compared with 90% for ceftazidime and 92% for cefoperazone. Ro 23-9424 was bactericidal, was relatively stable to inoculum effects on MICs at 10(7) CFU/ml, and was determined to be highly active against organisms resistant to fluoroquinolones or ceftazidime. Preliminary quality control guidelines were determined, and a 30-micrograms disk concentration appears to be the most usable form.\r"

In 6 patients in each group, myocardial biopsies were done before ischemia and at the time of reperfusion. Samples were assessed by chemiluminescence to determine oxidative stress and by electron microscopic studies. A significant reduction in atrial arrhythmias was observed in the mannitol group. Chemiluminescence in group 1 showed a photoemission of 37.6 +/- 3.5 cpm/mg of protein x 10(-3) for the preischemia samples and 74.8 +/- 16 cpm/mg of protein x 10(-3) for the reperfusion samples (p less than 0.001). In group 2, the values for chemiluminescence were 37.7 +/- 3.4 cpm/mg of protein x 10(-3) and 40 +/- 6.1 cpm/mg of protein x 10(-3), respectively (p = not significant). Electron microscopic studies showed, for group 1, increased grades of damaged mitochondria in the reperfusion biopsy specimens compared with the preischemia biopsy specimens (p less than 0.01). In group 2, differences for damaged mitochondria were not significant. These results support the hypothesis that mannitol reperfusate significantly reduces myocardial damage in patients undergoing open heart procedures. They also suggest that this protective effect may be in part secondary to the antioxidant property of mannitol, although other mechanisms may have accounted for or contributed to the improved outcome after ischemia.\r"

A high incidence of atrial and complex ventricular arrhythmias was observed in the placebo-treated group, with a clear predominance in patients undergoing left thoracotomy. Antiarrhythmic drugs had to be added in 6 patients in the placebo-treated group (n = 16), but in none in the flecainide-treated group (n = 14) (p less than 0.01). The preventive effect of flecainide was observed at serum concentrations in the middle of the therapeutic range (409 ng/mL) without side effects.

This has been coupled with reports of internists becoming frustrated and of internists leaving primary care practice. We conducted a survey of 219 internists in academic and private practice in western New York. While internists were generally positive regarding the training of residents, there was a pervasive feeling of frustration and demoralization among practicing internists. This demoralization may affect recruitment of new physicians to internal medicine and cause early retirement of practicing internists. The study demonstrated some of the causes of the demoralization.\r"

  ".W": "We undertook a prospective study of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (ACAs) to determine their clinical significance in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). IgG ACAs were found in 24 (92.3%) of 26 patients with AIDS who were hospitalized for pulmonary complaints (group 1) and in 13 (93%) of 14 patients with AIDS-related complex (group 2). In addition, 17 (94%) of 18 patients with AIDS (group 3) who had coagulation tests and were studied retrospectively had IgG ACAs. The prevalence of IgG ACAs in these three groups was significantly higher than in healthy controls, but was comparable to that in 31 consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (67.7%). The mean titer of IgG ACAs in group 1 was higher than in groups 2 and 3 but was not different from that in the patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The frequency and titer of IgM ACAs in group 1 (7.6%) or group 2 (14.3%) were not significantly different from those in normal controls (4.7%). In contrast, half of the patients in group 3 had low-titer IgM ACAs. The serum titer of IgG ACAs in patients with AIDS with thrombocytopenia was significantly higher than it was in those with normal platelet counts. There was no association between ACAs and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or other infections, cancer, thrombosis, positive VDRL test, or presence of the lupus anticoagulant. The prevalence and titer of IgG or IgM ACAs were not associated with abnormal results of any coagulation test. Although we found IgG ACAs to be associated with thrombocytopenia in AIDS, their presence does not carry exactly the same clinical significance as it does in systemic lupus erythematosus. The high prevalence of ACAs in AIDS, in AIDS-related complex, and in otherwise healthy contacts with antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus suggests that their occurrence may be related to the underlying human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

To our knowledge, 20 similar cases have been reported in the medical literature. Most of them were attributed to sound-alike trade names of drugs. Inadvertent sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia has to be included in the differential diagnosis of severe unexplained hypoglycemia. This dangerous condition can be prevented by instructing patients to carefully identify their drugs, introducing typed prescription forms using generic names, and avoiding similar names and appearance of pills.\r"

Standard microbiologic methods were used to determine the bacteriocidal activity of Chlorazene in cultures containing up to 2.03 x 10(6) colony-forming units per milliliter of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Full-thickness skin wounds in 40 guinea pigs were inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all animals allowed to recover from anesthesia. Twenty-four hours later, animals were placed in water only or water containing Chlorazene (300ppm) for 20 minutes. This procedure was repeated daily for up to seven days after inoculation of wounded skin. Rate of wound epithelialization and number of infected wounds were determined. Large reductions in numbers of cultured organisms were observed after treatment with Chlorazene. No differences in rate of wound healing could be determined in water- or Chlorazene-treated animals. Chlorazene-treated wounds contained fewer pseudomonas organisms than water-treated controls on postinoculation days five and six. These results confirm that Chlorazene is an effective water disinfectant. Data also indicate that in the concentration used, Chlorazene does not affect the rate of wound healing.\r"

A sample of clients were interviewed 1 month after entry to the scheme and again 3 months later to evaluate changes in injecting and sexual risk behaviours for HIV infection. Clients were asked to donate saliva for anti-HIV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody capture radioimmunoassay (GACRIA). The rate of lending and borrowing used injecting equipment fell, both compared with rates prior to entry to the scheme and during the period of study. Frequency of injecting did not increase and there was reduced incidence of abscesses. There was a highly significant correlation between multiple sexual partners and condom use and a reduction in the proportion of clients with multiple partners. On entry to the study, seven out of 121 (6%) clients were anti-HIV positive; after 3 months, a further two clients tested were found to be anti-HIV positive. Anti-HIV positivity prevalence for the year of study was nine out of 121 (7%). The scheme attracts clients, reduces injecting-related risk for HIV infection and has high equipment return rates. Saliva testing is acceptable to clients. Continued monitoring of anti-HIV in saliva is indicated.\r"

Fifteen syringe-exchange schemes in England and Scotland participated in a government-sponsored pilot programme from April 1987. Clients were provided with sterile injecting equipment and condoms, and with knowledge of HIV risks. One hundred and forty-two injecting drug users who first attended between April 1987 and March 1988 participated in a prospective interview-based survey with questions at two points in time. Measurements were self-reported attitudinal, knowledge and behavioural changes relevant to HIV infection and transmission. Many clients maintained or adopted low-risk behaviours: 79% sustained or adopted low or lower levels of syringe sharing. Trends identified include decreases in syringe-sharing, from 34 to 27%; using others' syringes (risk of infection) from 25 to 19%; passing on syringes (risk of transmission) from 30 to 25%. Many clients reported changes in sexual behaviour; those with sexual partners decreased from 77 to 69% and those with two or more sexual partners from 26 to 21%. However, non-use of condoms increased from 62 to 79%. Comparison groups of non-attenders showed higher levels of risk behaviour (59-62% sharing syringes, 86-88% with sexual partners). Overall, changes in HIV risk behaviour show small but encouraging trends and support arguments that injectors can be helped to change their behaviour, which could be of cumulative importance in reducing the spread of HIV.\r"

Elevated levels of neopterin as well as beta 2-M were found in the CSF of three patients with primary HIV-1 infection and also in subjects in the early stages of chronic HIV-1 infection, with the highest levels in HIV-1 isolation-positive people. There was a clear correlation between the concentrations of the two substances and the levels seemed to increase in parallel with progress of infection. A similar pattern was found in blood. Higher concentrations of neopterin and beta 2-M in CSF than in blood were found in patients with advanced dementia in particular. These findings indicate that the cellular immune system in the central nervous system (CNS) may be activated during the early stages of HIV-1 infection without concomitant overt neurological symptoms. The pathological processes in CNS and blood seem to develop in parallel rather than being restricted to one compartment.\r"

  ".W": "Neopterin, a biochemical marker for the activation of cell-mediated immune reactions, was determined in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients infected with HIV-1. A significant correlation was found between serum and CSF neopterin concentrations, although concentrations of neopterin in serum were more closely correlated with the clinical severity of HIV-1 infection than those in CSF. However, higher CSF levels were observed in patients with neurologic/psychiatric symptoms than in unaffected patients. Also, quotients of CSF neopterin versus serum neopterin concentrations were increased, indicating intrathecal production of neopterin. Positive HIV-1 isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was associated with higher neopterin concentrations in serum, when compared with negative HIV-1 isolation. Neopterin in CSF appears to be a suitable biochemical marker in patients with HIV-1 infection for detecting overt neurologic/psychiatric disturbances. The data suggest that in HIV-1 infected patients, cell-mediated immune reactions might be activated intrathecally and might contribute to neuropsychiatric disease.\r"

In healthy subjects, HIV-1 antibody was present in 6% of 332 pregnant women and in 4.5% of 155 blood donors. Of the blood donors, pregnant women and OPD patients without a history of STD (628 subjects in all), 465 belonged to the rural population of the region and the majority were peasants. In this subgroup, the HIV-1 antibody prevalence was 4.8% in blood donors, 4.9% in pregnant women and 10.3% in OPD patients.

In this population with a low prevalence of HIV infection (16/599), two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA; Abbott and Elavia) and two rapid assays (cambridge latex agglutination and Du Pont's HIV-CHEK) exhibited less than optimal sensitivities. However, with the exception of Elavia, these assays displayed excellent specificities. The fifth test (Serodia gelatin agglutination) produced the highest sensitivity (0.938) and negative predictive value but the lowest specificity and positive predictive value of all five tests. False positive reactions, which occurred only with the Elavia and Serodia tests, could not be explained on the basis of early infection in patients or cross-reactions with the related retroviruses HIV-2 and HTLV-I. We conclude that none of the five tests alone is sufficient in this testing situation, but that a combination of tests could satisfy most requirements for identifying HIV-1 reactive and non-reactive sera.\r"

Toward this end, zidovudine (10 microM) has been included in the tissue culture medium used to isolate HIV-1. Under these circumstances, virus with a zidovudine-resistant phenotype was successfully obtained in five out of 20 cases. This property of drug resistance appeared to be stable, and did not disappear upon extended replication of such virus in the absence of drug pressure. Drug-resistant virus could also be isolated from these subjects on subsequent occasions, but was not present in samples obtained prior to therapy. Replication of these zidovudine-resistant isolates in tissue culture was inhibited by each of four other nucleoside analogues. Thus, other drugs may be useful in controlling selective zidovudine-resistant variants of HIV-1.\r"

We have shown that zidovudine is activated by thymidine kinase (TK) in CEM cells to the triphosphate anabolite, which is incorporated into DNA. One microM zidovudine is sufficient for saturation of activation by TK and also of zidovudine monophosphate, by thymidylate kinase, to the diphosphate. Zidovudine triphosphate peaked 4 h after initiation of drug administration in CEM cells and then declined biexponentially. Nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) cellular concentrations declined rapidly in the cells after exposure to zidovudine. Concomitantly phosphorylation of zidovudine to zidovudine monophosphate and zidovudine monophosphate to zidovudine diphosphate declined in a similar manner in the CEM cells. The amount of zidovudine anabolite incorporated into purified DNA peaked 1 h after zidovudine treatment and declined thereafter with first order elimination kinetics. These studies elucidate the cellular activation of zidovudine in a T-cell line, CEM, and enhance our understanding of this important anti-HIV drug.\r"

Chondroitin polysulphate with a molecular weight (MW) of 9000 daltons (CPS 9000) was the most effective polyanionic compound studied. In contrast with zidovudine, this CPS 9000 was not toxic for MT-4 cells up to a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml.

These patients represented 3% of adults and 7.4% of children with AIDS observed in Kigali during the study period. Thirteen of the adults and five of the children were HIV-1 WB positive. All patients were HTLV-I WB negative. One adult AIDS patient had a reactive HIV-2 WB; he is the first HIV-2-infected individual to be diagnosed in Rwanda. HIV antigenaemia was demonstrated in only one adult and one child, suggesting that HIV antigenaemia is not frequent in African AIDS patients, even in the case of weak immunologic responses to HIV core proteins. Three adults and four children had none of the serological markers detected. This study showed that HIV EIA negativity occurs infrequently in African patients with AIDS. In such a situation, an attempt to detect HIV antibodies by a more sensitive technique, such as WB, is necessary.\r"

Misbeliefs about modes of transmission clearly encourage individuals' willingness to stigmatize AIDS patients and to support the most coercive measures of prevention (such as quarantine). Advertizing efforts to promote use of condoms, sexual education in schools, and systematic HIV screening for pregnant women are the only measures which create a broad consensus independently of sociocultural differences. Socioeconomic status and even religious or political beliefs strongly influence public opinions toward other preventive measures.\r"

Despite the availability of serological testing for HIV infection, donor deferral remains of prime importance because of the period between HIV-infection and development of antibodies (the 'window phase'). Therefore blood and plasma donors are informed about AIDS and risk factors. Reactions of donors to such information were investigated in a regional blood bank in the Netherlands (1985-1987). Although there seems to be a good understanding of the necessity of reading information about AIDS, personal motives (not belonging to a risk group, having read information before, etc.) resulted in insufficient attention to the written information (a circular letter) by more than one third of respondents. We recommend that information on risk factors is given by a personal approach (i.e. interview) and by emphasizing the personal responsibility of donors for the safety of the blood supply used in blood transfusion therapy.\r"

For each behavior, men who adopted consistently safer behavior were compared with those who remained unsafe, using bivariate analyses and multiple logistic regression modelling. The strongest predictor of all behaviors was the initial level of the unsafe behavior. After controlling for this, weak effects of several health beliefs were found, including perceived susceptibility and medical efficacy. Men who became aware of a positive HIV-antibody test result and who reported greater effort to change their behavior were more likely to adopt safer insertive anogenital contact. In this generally well-educated cohort with high levels of knowledge about AIDS, adoption of safer sexual behaviors is best predicted from previous levels of unsafe behavior.\r"

Of 12 germinal testicular tumours collected, six were seminomas, two of which were pure embryonal and the other four embryonal mixed. Cervical carcinoma was observed in nine IVDAs (intraepithelial in eight and advanced, with rapid progression, in one). Lung cancer associated with HIV infection was reported in eight patients, of whom four had an adenocarcinoma, two a small cell carcinoma, one an epidermoid carcinoma and one a mesothelioma. All patients with non-small-cell-lung cancer (SCLC) were at stage III, while those with SCLC and mesothelioma had limited disease. Five out of eight presented with limited disease at onset. The median age was low; lung cancer occurred predominantly in young adults, of whom all but one were smokers. Three patients could not be treated; four died while on treatment because of progression of the neoplasia and one died of an overdose. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was diagnosed in five patients. The immunophenotype was always Burkitt-like (L3), and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (M2) was diagnosed in one. Of the central nervous system (CNS) tumours, two cases of glioblastoma and one of medulloblastoma were described. Two cases of young adults with multiple myeloma and two cases of colorectal carcinoma were also reported. One case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, one anorectal carcinoma, one oral carcinoma, one pancreatic carcinoma, one thymoma, one kidney carcinoma, one malignant melanoma and thyroid carcinoma were also found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A correct and complete diagnosis was made on visual endoscopic criteria in 43 cases (95.5%) but in only 14 cases (31.1%) from barium studies alone. Radiology showed no abnormality in 22 cases where pathological changes were documented (oesophageal candidiasis in 21 cases). Where pathological confirmation of diagnosis existed (40 cases), endoscopy (without pathological support) had a sensitivity of 97.5% and a specificity of 100% compared with the sensitivity and specificity of 25 and 100% for barium studies. The difference between the sensitivities of the two methods was highly significant (P less than 0.005). The combination of oral candidiasis and upper gastrointestinal symptoms without dysphagia or weight loss was so strongly associated with uncomplicated oesophageal candidiasis (negative predictive value 93%; P less than 0.025), that this is supported as a basis for therapy without the need for further investigation, although if upper gastrointestinal investigation is required, endoscopy should be the method of choice.\r"

We treated 11 consecutive patients with the oral combination of ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily) and rifampin (600 mg twice daily) for 6 to 12 weeks (mean, 8 weeks). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from ear canal or mastoid, and bone destruction was documented by computed tomography in all patients. Seven patients (64%) had ear irrigation before onset of the infection. Ten patients fulfilled the criteria of both clinical and bacteriologic cure. No serious adverse reaction to either antibiotic was observed. Otalgia and otorrhea responded at a mean of 6 and 4 days, respectively, following the initiation of therapy. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate fell from a mean pretherapy value of 81 mm/h (range, 41 to 138 mm/h) to 18 mm/h (range, 3 to 45 mm/h) after the completion of antibiotic therapy. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations established that all organisms were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Time-kill curve and checkerboard assays failed to demonstrate either synergy or antagonism between ciprofloxacin and rifampin. Serum inhibitory and bactericidal titers showed minimal increase in inhibition and killing of the bacteria with the addition of rifampin. Rifampin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin. The successful use of oral antibiotics for this difficult infection may be a major advance. Reduction in antibiotic costs and hospitalization and convenience of oral administration were of notable benefit.\r"

After exposure to UV-C in doses ranging from 0.75 to 2.0 mJ/cm2, U1 cells were induced to express virus as assessed by detection of elevated reverse transcriptase activity and p24 antigen levels in culture supernatants of treated cells compared with unstimulated controls. In addition, immunofluorescence on cytospin preparations of UV-irradiated cells revealed a time-dependent increase in viral antigen production after UV stimulation. A similar increase in RT levels was seen after exposure of U1 cells to UV-B, although somewhat higher doses of UV-B (mJ) were required compared with UV-C (mJ). Viral induction by UV irradiation was associated with a drop in viability and a static growth curve, suggesting that a certain level of cellular stress was most likely necessary to initiate viral expression. The potential role of UV-induced cell damage with activation of a cellular \"SOS\" repair response is a probable explanation of the enhanced viral production observed.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on myocardial ischaemia was studied in 12 normotensive patients with chronic stable angina and exercise induced ST segment depression. The study was randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, and crossover with treatment periods of two weeks. Enalapril was used to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme. Assessment was by angina diaries and maximum symptom limited treadmill exercise tests. The results for the whole group showed a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure at rest and at peak exercise. Mean total exercise duration was 466 s (95% confidence interval 406 to 525) when the patients were taking placebo and 509 s (436 to 583) when they were taking enalapril. Four patients prolonged their total exercise time (mean 450 to mean 591 s) by more than 20%. Two patients, however, developed ischaemia earlier on exercise and reduced their total exercise duration (mean 490 to mean 390 s). Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition tended to reduce myocardial ischaemia in the group as a whole, some patients improved while others deteriorated. Thus the effects of enalapril are variable and this may have important implications when enalapril is used to treat heart failure in patients with underlying severe ischaemic heart disease.\r"

After cardiac transplantation left ventricular myocardial stiffness was increased and a mild degree of incoordinate contraction and relaxation was seen. In contrast, after heart-lung transplantation diastolic function was almost normal. Impairment of passive diastolic properties was significantly related to the ischaemic time of the donor heart and the donor's age. The index of left ventricular asynchrony was related to the ischaemic time and the recipient's age. The interval between transplantation and study did not influence the number of rejection episodes. This study confirms the presence of diastolic dysfunction after cardiac transplantation. Impairment of diastolic function seems to be related to the ischaemic time of the donor heart and to a mismatch between the size of the donor heart and the recipient's needs.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty three children with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia were treated with flecainide. Twenty one of these received intravenous treatment during an attack (2 mg/kg over 10 minutes). The tachycardia was terminated in 17. After an intravenous bolus of flecainide, blood samples were drawn at regular intervals for analysis of flecainide concentration over 48 hours. Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated--median terminal half life 7.5 hours, median volume of distribution 6.2 l/kg, and median plasma clearance 7.2 ml/min/kg. There was a significant correlation between half life and age. Twenty of the children received long term treatment with an oral preparation of flecainide to prevent further attacks. Twelve had no further attacks and 16 were considered to have good control. Two children suffered potentially serious arrhythmogenic effects soon after the start of oral treatment and flecainide had to be stopped. During oral treatment regular blood samples were drawn and plasma concentrations were analysed to assess the therapeutic range. This did not differ substantially from that proposed in adults (400-800 micrograms/l). Eight children were electively withdrawn from oral flecainide to see whether they really needed it. Blood samples for measurement of flecainide concentration were drawn after their last oral dose. Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated: time to maximum concentration 2 hours, median terminal half life 7.9 hours. For the combined data from patients receiving intravenous and oral treatment there was a significant correlation between elimination half life and age. An intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg over at least 10 minutes and an initial oral dose of 6 mg/kg/day in three divided doses is recommended. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They were allocated randomly to three groups, one receiving no fentanyl (n = 6), the two others receiving fentanyl 50 micrograms either extradurally (n = 15) or i.v. (n = 6). Three tests of sensitivity to carbon dioxide (Read's method) were performed successively on each patient: before operation and at 1 and 2 h after the extradural injection. Whereas lignocaine and adrenaline alone had no significant effects on basal ventilation and the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide, extradural fentanyl caused a slight reduction in resting ventilatory rate and ventilation at 1 and 2 h with no change in resting end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration. In addition, the slope of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide was reduced slightly at 1 h and ventilation at end-tidal PCO2 of 7.3 kPa was reduced also at 1 and 2 h. Conversely, the same dose of fentanyl i.v. had lesser and shorter effects on ventilation at rest and during carbon dioxide rebreathing. Our results show that fentanyl 50 micrograms given extradurally caused slight ventilatory depression which is probably clinically unimportant.\r"

  ".W": "Granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an important hematopoietic growth factor. Mesenchymal cells produce abundant GM-CSF in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF). We wished to determine (1) what cellular pathways enhanced levels of GM-CSF mRNA, and (2) if TNF used any of these pathways. Modulation in levels of GM-CSF mRNA in human fibroblasts (WI-38) was studied by using Northern blot analysis. Markedly increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA occurred in these cells after exposure to sodium fluoride (NaF) and the effect of NaF was slightly enhanced by aluminum chloride; these results suggest that accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA can occur by activating a G-binding protein. Stimulators of protein kinase C dramatically increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA; however, blockade of protein kinase C activity did not attenuate accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA stimulated by TNF and NaF. Exposure to ouabain increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA and this effect was prominently enhanced in the presence of low concentrations of extracellular K+ and was almost abolished in high concentrations of extracellular K+. A monovalent ionophore (monensin) also increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA. Both ouabain and monensin can increase intracellular Ca++ concentration (Cai++) through Na+-Ca++ exchange. A calcium channel blocker (diltiazem) blocked the increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA mediated by ouabain, but could not block the stimulation mediated by TNF alpha. Ca++ ionophores also increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA and rapidly increased levels of Cai++. TNF did not increase Cai++ and, moreover, was able to stimulate accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA in the absence of extracellular Ca++. Taken together, we have found that several different cellular pathways can lead to prominent accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA in mesenchymal cells including (1) activation of protein kinase C, (2) increase in Cai++, and (3) stimulation of G-binding protein. Our studies show that TNF appears to increase levels of GM-CSF mRNA independent of protein kinase C activity or levels of Cai++.\r"

  ".W": "The secretion of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase (u-PA) and their inhibitors by the human leukemia cell line K562 was examined. K562 cells normally secrete both t-PA and u-PA in a ratio of 3:1. After addition of 10 or 1 ng/mL phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to K562 cells, a marked decrease in enzymatic activity is observed in the medium. However, when t-PA antigen rather than activity is measured, an increased amount is found in the medium under these conditions. PMA also induces secretion of the two inhibitors of plasminogen activator: plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2). This accounts for the decrease in total enzymatic activity under conditions when production of t-PA antigen is increased. A study of the time course of induction revealed that the synthesis of plasminogen activator occurred before that of its inhibitors. Low concentrations of PMA (0.1 ng/mL) induce t-PA antigen primarily and not the inhibitors. This results in an increase in total enzymatic activity, with 94% of the secreted activity being t-PA. Thus, the secretion of plasminogen activators and their inhibitors can be manipulated in certain leukemic cells by inducers such as PMA.\r"

Clinical groups consisting of pregnant women with either severe preeclampsia or chronic hypertension with superimposed severe preeclampsia, as well as normal pregnant and nonpregnant women, were analyzed in a panel of functional and immunologic assays for PAI-1 and PAI-2. Pure severe preeclamptic patients in their third trimester showed a significant increase in both antigenic (136 ng/mL) and functional (5.76 U/mL) type 1 PAI (PAI-1) as compared with normal third-trimester pregnant women (34.8 ng/mL and 2.57 U/mL, respectively). In contrast, antigenic (186 ng/mL) and functional (5.76 U/mL) levels of type 2 PAI (PAI-2) were significantly lower in the pure severe preeclampsia group as compared with the values of the normal pregnant group (269 ng/mL and 9.58 U/mL, respectively). The patients with chronic hypertension and superimposed severe preeclampsia exhibited PAI-2 levels comparable to those of the pure preeclamptic group, whereas their antigenic and functional PAI-1 levels were intermediate (94 ng/mL and 3.25 U/mL, respectively) between the normal pregnant and the pure preeclamptic groups. During early puerperium of both normal pregnant women and patients, plasma PAI-1 antigen and activity decreased within one day to approximately the levels detected in normal nonpregnant women, while PAI-2 levels remained elevated for over 11 days. Similar results were obtained in plasma samples obtained from citrated blood and blood collected with an anticoagulant/antiplatelet mixture, suggesting that increased PAI-1 levels in preeclamptic patients were not due to platelet activation in vitro. In preeclamptic patients, a positive correlation between birth weight and PAI-2 values was observed (r = .64, P less than .05), whereas birth weight was inversely correlated with both PAI-1 levels and total PAI activity (r = -.6, P less than .005 and r = -.76, P less than .005 respectively). Preeclamptic patients with extensive placental infarction exhibited higher plasma PAI activity (24.1 U/mL v 11.6 U/mL) and PAI-1 values (305 ng/mL v 80.9 ng/mL) than preeclamptic patients without extensive placental infarction. In contrast, PAI-2 levels were reduced in preeclamptic patients with infarction in comparison with those of patients without infarction (141 ng/mL v 212.9 ng/mL). Our data indicate that increases in the level of PAI-1 accounts for the high plasma PAI activity in severe preeclampsia as measured using single-chain t-PA.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy may improve immune reconstitution and reduce the risk of leukemic relapse in the setting of minimal residual disease by augmenting cytotoxic effector mechanisms directed at residual malignant cells. In addition, IL-2 in vitro promotes the release of cytokines including gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which also possess antileukemic activity and can enhance granulocyte function. To determine if IL-2 infusion induces release of gamma-IFN and TNF in vivo in sufficient quantity to mediate these effects, we have measured serum levels of these cytokines and secretion by lymphocytes obtained from patients receiving this cytokine in a phase 1 trial. Serum gamma-IFN was undetectable pre-IL-2 and increased to 1.5 to 17 U/mL during IL-2 infusion (P less than .05). Culture of patient lymphocytes for 48 hours produced 1.2 U gamma-IFN/2 x 10(6) cells/mL pre-IL-2 rising to 50 U/2 x 10(6) cells/mL when the lymphocytes were obtained during therapy (P less than .05). Lymphocyte subset analysis showed that both CD3+ and CD16+ cells secreted gamma-IFN in response to IL-2. TNF secretion by lymphocytes also rose during IL-2 infusion from a mean of 5 U/mL to 14.4 U/mL (P less than .01) although no rise was seen in serum levels. The material secreted by IL-2-stimulated lymphocytes is bioactive as addition of supernatants from lymphocytes obtained during IL-2 therapy to cultures of myeloid blasts significantly inhibited clonogenic growth. IL-2-induced secretion of these cytokines mediated this inhibition as it could be partially blocked by either anti-gamma-IFN or anti-TNF antibodies. Preincubation of granulocytes with the same supernatants produced enhanced oxidative metabolism, measured by chemiluminescence in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). This effect also could be partially abrogated by anti-gamma-IFN and anti-TNF antibodies. Therefore, secondary cytokine secretion may boost granulocyte function and contribute to the antileukemic effects of IL-2 infusion in patients following bone marrow transplantation or chemotherapy.\r"

PATIENTS--All women aged 35-64 registered in 1984 increasing in 1988 to all women aged 20-64. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Assessment of uptake of smear tests and reasons for smear not being taken and of the effect of these outcomes on the new general practitioner contract. RESULTS--The numbers and percentages of women having a smear test in the previous five and three years were recorded, and the reasons why a smear was not taken were defined in the remainder (hysterectomy, test not offered, risk not known, test declined, patient moved away, and patient unaccounted for). In 1988, 85% (608/719) of the women aged 30-64 and 80% (693/870) of those aged 20-64 had had a smear test in the previous five years.

CONCLUSIONS--The population studied contained a substantial number of women in whom cervical smear was unnecessary, inappropriate, or refused. These factors and the likely demographic variation in the uptake of smear tests have important implications for the setting and achieving of the government's targets for cervical cytology screening.\r"

DESIGN--All relevant aspects of the organisational process examined, including general practitioners' notes. Non-responders visited and interviewed. SETTING--An inner city breast screening service working on the model advocated by the Forrest report. SUBJECTS--288 Women aged 50-64 registered with several general practices and invited for screening by post. MAIN OUTCOME--Determination of factors important for success of breast screening programmes. RESULTS--After five women were excluded by their general practitioners the response rate was 129 out of 283 (46%), but 99 (35%) of the women did not receive their invitations because of inaccuracies in the family practitioner committee's database and general practitioners failing to check women's addresses completely. CONCLUSIONS--Increased rates of response will depend on enabling general practitioners to check addresses and on an increased awareness of the importance of information.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective cohort study of middle aged men conducted over 25 years. SETTING--Finish components of an ongoing international study (seven countries study). PARTICIPANTS--1520 Men who at age 40-59 in 1959 were free of clinically evident heart disease. INTERVENTIONS--At each follow up visit a detailed medical examination including resting electrocardiography was performed, blood pressure and serum total cholesterol concentration were measured, and smoking was assessed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--825 Deaths (54% of participants) occurred during follow up, of which 335 were due to coronary heart disease. The hazard ratio for death from coronary heart disease with respect to risk factors at entry were: for serum cholesterol concentrations above 8.4 mmol/l v below 5.2 mmol/l, 2.68 (95% confidence interval 1.62 to 4.42); for systolic blood pressure in the highest quintile v that in the lowest quintile, 2.46 (1.72 to 3.50); and for smoking 10 or more cigarettes daily v never smoking, 1.95 (1.36 to 2.79). The hazard ratios with respect to cholesterol concentrations and blood pressure remained constant during follow up but the ratio with respect to smoking diminished, mainly owing to men giving up the habit. The estimated conditional probability of a 50 year old man dying of coronary heart disease in the next 25 years ranged from 12% among those with the most favourable risk factor profile to 75% among those with the least favourable profile. CONCLUSIONS--High risk factor levels (as determined in this study) in middle aged men may greatly increase the absolute probability of death from coronary heart disease when the period of study is relevant to the human life span.\r"

Overall, 860 (12.5%) of the men and 1141 (16.8%) of the women reported having at least one symptom of mental distress. There were no distinct differences between the age groups. Single people, separated and divorced people, and those who reported that the financial situation of the family during their childhood was difficult reported more mental problems. Heavy smoking, frequent alcohol consumption, and, in men, little or no physical activity in leisure time were also associated with a high prevalence of mental distress. By multiple regression analyses, marital state, financial situation of family during childhood, and current lifestyle were found to be highly significantly associated with mental distress. Including a few questions on mental distress in health surveys provides a way to establish relations between such symptoms and social conditions and lifestyle in large numbers of subjects.\r"

DESIGN--Blind assessment of patients having chemotherapy and subsequent comparison with the first suitable patients matched for age and sex who were attending the clinic during the same period after having completed treatment. Controls were obtained the following year by taking the first suitable patients attending a routine dermatology outpatient clinic who matched the study groups for age and sex. SETTING--Referrals to a paediatric oncology clinic and a dermatology clinic at two city hospitals. PATIENTS--The group receiving chemotherapy comprised all 32 patients with acute lymphatic leukaemia, lymphoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma who were attending the paediatric oncology clinic on two mornings a week during October 1987 to March 1988. The group who had completed treatment comprised 32 patients who were attending for follow up during the same period and who matched the first group for age and sex. Thirty two other patients attending the dermatology outpatient clinic with unrelated skin conditions served as controls. END POINT--Definite increase in numbers of moles on children after a course of chemotherapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Moles were counted by one observer on defined areas of the body and divided into those less than 3 mm and greater than or equal to 3 mm diameter. Patients receiving chemotherapy had a similar number of moles to the control group. By contrast patients who had completed chemotherapy had significant increases both in moles less than 3 mm and greater than or equal to 3 mm and in the total number of moles. These patients were more likely to have moles on acral sites. CONCLUSIONS--Children with substantially increased numbers of moles (benign melanocytic naevi) after successful chemotherapy for malignancy may have an increased risk of melanoma. They should be offered prolonged surveillance and cautioned about exposure to ultraviolet light.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective study of a cohort of elite athletes and a group of normal, healthy, untrained controls examined 15 years after initial testing. SETTING--Research project at school for physical education and sports. SUBJECTS--27 Former long distance runners (mean age 42), nine former bobsleigh riders (mean age 42), and 23 normal, healthy, untrained men (mean age 35) who had been examined in 1973 and who agreed to re-examination in 1988. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Radiological evidence of degenerative hip disease in 1988. RESULTS--Physiological and exercise characteristics of all subjects had been recorded in 1973, and in 1988 these measurements were repeated together with radiological examination of the hips. An additive radiological index of hip disease based on grades of subchondral sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and joint space narrowing was significantly increased among runners as compared with bobsleigh riders and untrained controls. After adjustment for age the significant effect of type of sports activity remained (p = 0.032). In multivariate analyses age and milage run in 1973 (97 km/week) emerged as independent, significant, and positive predictors of radiological signs of degenerative hip disease in 1988 (p = 0.017 and p = 0.024 respectively). Among runners alone running pace in 1973 rather than milage run was the stronger predictor of subsequent degenerative hip disease. The milage run in 1988 was not particularly predictive of the radiological index, but endurance in 1988 was inversely related to degenerative hip disease seen radiologically. CONCLUSION--Long term, high intensity, high milage running should not be dismissed as a potential risk factor for premature osteoarthritis of the hip.\r"

Only 70 (18%) had been breast fed. Three quarters of the pupils thought breast feeding was healthier than bottle feeding and that it was natural, but 32 (8%) thought that it was rude. Most pupils said that breast feeding should be discussed in class. More open discussion might reduce embarrassment and also help prepare for parenthood.\r"

SETTING--Research project coordinated by the Alcohol Research Group, Edinburgh. SUBJECTS--205 Sex workers (102 male, 103 female) interviewed between July and December 1988. END POINT--Strategies to reduce risk of AIDS among people who buy and sell sexual services. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Data were elicited by a standardised interview which related to over 300 variables. A fifth of the study group had used drugs intravenously, and one in 12 reported that they had been found to be seropositive on HIV testing. Roughly a quarter of the study group sometimes engaged in unprotected sex with clients for more money, and a similar proportion sometimes did not seek medical advice even if they had genital or anal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS--People who buy and sell sexual services should be priority targets for health education and strategies to reduce their risk of AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To estimate the prevalence of important side effects in patients with malignant disease who were receiving high doses of morphine as part of their palliative treatment. DESIGN--Data on patients were collected over 12 months. SETTING--Two palliative care units in Western Australia. PATIENTS--19 Patients with malignant disease who were receiving morphine either subcutaneously or orally as the main analgesic. 10 Patients receiving a total daily dose of morphine of at least 500 mg orally or 250 mg parenterally were enrolled in the study. The other 9 patients were enrolled after an important problem thought to be related to the morphine had been identified. All of the patients were taking drugs to supplement the treatment. INTERVENTIONS--The dose of morphine or route of administration, or both, was changed in three patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Determination of the prevalence of side effects in the patients. Assessment of the relation of any side effects with the supplemental drugs taken by the patients. MAIN RESULTS--Plasma morphine and electrolyte concentrations were measured and a full history taken for each patient. Thirteen of the 19 patients had an important side effect; 12 of them had myoclonus and one had hyperalgesia of the skin. Plasma morphine concentrations were similar in patients with and without myoclonus, ranging from 158 to 3465 nmol/l and 39 to 2821 nmol/l respectively. Eight of the patients with side effects were taking an antipsychotic drug concurrently compared with none of those without side effects. A greater proportion of patients with side effects were taking the antinauseant drug thiethylperazine (6/13 v 2/6) and at least one non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (10/13 v 2/6), whereas a smaller proportion were taking a glucocorticosteroid (3/13 v 4/6). The estimated prevalence of important side effects in the total population of patients receiving palliative treatment in the two units was 2.7-3.6%. CONCLUSIONS--Myoclonus as a side effect of treatment with morphine is more likely to occur in patients taking antidepressant or antipsychotic drugs as antiemetics or as adjuvant agents or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for additional analgesia. If a patient develops myoclonus the best approach may be to change the supplemental treatment.\r"

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE--Progression of HIV infection, defined as CD4 lymphocyte count less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l, recurrence of HIV antigenaemia, or progression to Centers for Disease Control group IV. MAIN RESULTS--Median follow up was 670 (range 45-1506) days. An acute illness like glandular fever occurred in 46 (53%) subjects. Three year progression rates to Centers for Disease Control group IV was 78% at three years for those who had longlasting illnesses (duration greater than or equal to 14 days) during seroconversion as compared with 10% for those who were free of symptoms or had mild illness. All six patients who developed AIDS had had longlasting primary illnesses. Three year progression rates to a CD4 lymphocyte count less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l and to recurrence of HIV antigenaemia were significantly higher for those who had longlasting primary illnesses than those who had no symptoms or mild illness (75% v 42% and 55% v 14%, respectively).

DESIGN--Prospective randomised controlled trial over a year. SETTING--One group general practice. PATIENTS--416 Women over 35 eligible for a smear test who had never had a cervical smear test or in whom a smear test was overdue (previous test more than five years before). INTERVENTIONS--One group received written invitations to have a smear taken. The second group had their notes tagged so that the doctor would remind them (when they attended for another reason) to have a smear test. No special intervention was made in the third group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Performance of a cervical smear test during the year of the study. RESULTS--32% (45/140) of the screened group, 27% (39/142) of the tagged group, and 15% (20/134) of the control group had a smear test during the year. The percentage of women having a smear test in the screened group was not significantly different from that in the tagged group, but the percentages in the two groups were significantly different from that in the control group. Whether a woman had had a previous smear test significantly affected the uptake of the invitation to have a smear test independently of the method of invitation. CONCLUSIONS--The systematic methods of call and recall were more effective than a non-systematic method. There was no significant difference between the two systematic methods (sending letters or tagging the notes) at one year.\r"

In recent years, however, the decrease in mortality due to cervical cancer has levelled off, with most cases of severe disease arising in women who have not been screened. In view of this the health board developed a new computer system for call and recall based on the community health index. This facility allowed the unscreened population to be identified and located on an individual general practice basis. The findings of the call programme in the 3136 women aged 50-60 were studied. The 29 practices in Perth and Kinross participated in the scheme. Before the call started 4287 out of 7423 (58%) women had been screened, and after the call programme this had risen to 5109 (69%). Moreover, a further 1158 (15%) women were identified who had a valid reason for exclusion from the programme. This meant that 6267 (84%) women of the study population were accounted for by the system. The call programme in Tayside will be completed in 1989 and will include all women aged 20-60.\r"

DESIGN--Two year prospective follow up study of electrophysiological measurements in subjects positive for HIV antibody but without AIDS. SETTING--HIV screening clinic and clinical departments in a university hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. SUBJECTS--Twelve homosexual men positive for HIV antibody who had not developed AIDS. RESULTS--Eight latencies were measured: from the ankle to T12, the wrist to C7, T12 to the cerebral cortex, C7 to the cerebral cortex, the ankle to the gluteal crease (tibial nerve), the gluteal crease to T12, the wrist to Erb's point (median nerve), and Erb's point to C7. Spinal latencies increased in all subjects at C7 by a mean of 4.2% (SE 0.9%) and in all except one at T12 by a mean of 5.5% (1.0%). The conduction time from the gluteal crease to T12 was increased by a mean of 32.0% (5.0%) whereas that in the median and tibial nerves by only 5.6% (1.0%) and 2.2% (2.2%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS--A mild and slowly progressive peripheral neuropathy of the axonal type and a more severe progressive myelopathy or myeloradiculopathy occur concomitantly with early HIV infection, possibly as the result of a direct neurotropic action of HIV.\r"

DESIGN--Mothers who planned to breast feed exclusively were randomly allocated to either a restricted diet (avoiding milk and other diary products, eggs, fish, peanuts, and soybeans) or a diet without restrictions. Mothers who did not plan to breast feed were randomly allocated to using one of three formula feeds. SETTING--Child health centre in Canada. SUBJECTS--97 Mothers who chose to breast feed and 124 mothers who did not. INTERVENTIONS--Restricted diet for 49 mothers who breast fed. Casein hydrolysate formula, soy milk formula, or cows' milk formula for infants not breast fed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Development of eczema in babies. RESULTS--Infants were followed up over 18 months and examined for eczema. Eczema was less common and milder in babies who were breast fed and whose mothers were on a restricted diet (11/49 (22%) v 21/48 (48%)). In infants fed casein hydrolysate, soy milk, or cows' milk 9/43 (21%), 26/41 (63%), and 28/40 (70%), respectively, developed atopic eczema. CONCLUSIONS--In families with a history of atopic disease [corrected] mothers who breast feed should avoid common allergenic foods during lactation.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the effect of long term antihypertensive treatment on prognosis in diabetic nephropathy. DESIGN--Prospective study of all insulin dependent diabetic patients aged under 50 with onset of diabetes before the age of 31 who developed diabetic nephropathy between 1974 and 1978 at Steno Memorial Hospital. SETTING--Outpatient diabetic clinic in tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--Forty five patients (20 women) with a mean age of 30 (SD 7) years and a mean duration of diabetes of 18 (7) years at onset of persistent proteinuria were followed until death or for at least 10 years. INTERVENTIONS--Antihypertensive treatment was started a median of three (0-13) years after onset of nephropathy. Four patients (9%) received no treatment, and 9 (20%), 13 (29%), and 19 (42%) were treated with one, two, or three drugs, respectively. The median follow up was 12 (4-15) years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Arterial blood pressure and death. RESULTS--Mean blood pressure at start of antihypertensive treatment was 148/95 (15/50) mm Hg. Systolic blood pressure remained almost unchanged (slope -0.01 (95% confidence interval -0.39 to 0.37) mm Hg a year) while diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly (0.87 (0.65 to 1.10) mm Hg a year) during antihypertensive treatment. The cumulative death rate was 18% (8 to 32%) 10 years after onset of nephropathy, in contrast to previous reports of 50% to 77% 10 years after onset of nephropathy. As in previous studies, uraemia was the main cause of death (9 patients; 64%). CONCLUSIONS--The prognosis of diabetic nephropathy has improved during the past decade largely because of effective antihypertensive treatment.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare grip strength and bone mineral content in the forearm in women and to test the effects on bone mineral content of short periods of exercise that stresses the skeleton. DESIGN--Assessment of both wrists in 69 volunteers and of the non-fractured wrist in 30 patients followed by an exercise regimen entailing squeezing a tennis ball as hard as possible for 30 seconds each day for six weeks. SETTING--Old people's homes and outpatient departments of Hammersmith and Northampton general hospitals. PATIENTS--99 Women, of whom 69 were volunteers and 30 had a fractured forearm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Grip strength and bone mineral content after six weeks and at six months after the exercises had stopped. RESULTS--The bone mineral content of the women's forearms was measured with a densitometer and the grip strength with a semi-inflated bag connected to an anaeroid barometer. Measurements before exercise showed that the two variables correlated closely, irrespective of age, and that there were significant differences in both between the dominant and non-dominant arms of the volunteers. After six weeks of exercise there was a mean increase in grip strength of 14.5% (95% confidence interval 9.9 to 19.2%) and in bone mineral content of 3.4% (1.4 to 5.3%) in the stressed forearms of the 77 women who attended for examination. After six months without exercise the improvements in the 33 women who attended for follow up had reversed. Women who had had a fractured forearm (n = 13), however, had continued to gain grip strength and bone mineral content in the arm that had not been injured. CONCLUSIONS--Grip strength in the forearm is a good indicator of bone mineral content. Both variables may be increased by brief periods of stressful exercise. If this principle can be applied to the whole skeleton it may provide a means of reversing osteoporosis.\r"

The results provided little evidence of regular attendance at local postgraduate centre meetings, though practice based educational meetings were common. Thirty one of the general practitioners worked in practices that held one or more practice based educational meetings each month at which the doctors provided the main educational content. Performance review was undertaken in the practices of 51 of the general practitioners, and 80 of the doctors recognised its value. The general practitioners considered that the most valuable educational activities occurred within the practice, the most valued being contact with partners. They asked for increased contact with hospital doctors. The development of general practitioners' continuing medical education should be based on the content of the individual general practitioner's day to day work and entail contact with his or her professional colleagues.\r"

  ".W": "Many serious disorders that threaten eyesight can now be treated with vitreoretinal surgery. As there was no regional facility for this treatment a service was developed to provide it. Among the first 100 patients treated over half had diabetic vitreoretinal disease. The remainder had ocular trauma (15), non-diabetic vasculopathy (10), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (10), and miscellaneous disorders including diagnostic procedures (14). Sight was improved in most cases, 27 diabetic and 21 non-diabetic patients regaining navigating vision. Few patients were made worse: one only of the 49 non-diabetic patients and 12 of the 51 diabetic patients, and none whose vision was better than the ability to count fingers before operation. The many indications for this procedure, the size of the population that could benefit (an estimated minimum of 3800 operations per year in the United Kingdom in patients with diabetes alone), and the great potential benefit of the procedure all suggest the need for regional services. These would be cost effective in preventing blindness.\r"
