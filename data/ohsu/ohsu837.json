  ".W": "We prospectively followed 29 children and adolescents over a 1- to 8-year period who were referred for evaluation of hyperglycemia (in the absence of diabetes) or glycosuria found on routine screening or during acute illness. On initial examination, four subjects had islet cell autoantibodies, 4 of 22 had an abnormal intravenous glucose tolerance test result, 6 of 22 had low first-phase insulin release on intravenous glucose tolerance testing, and 10 of 20 had impaired glucose tolerance on oral glucose tolerance testing. On follow-up, insulin-dependent diabetes had developed in two of the four subjects with islet cell autoantibodies. The other two subjects with islet cell antibodies have had persistently abnormal glucose tolerance on both oral and intravenous glucose tolerance testing and have low first-phase insulin responses. Diabetes has developed in none of 25 subjects without islet cell antibodies, although two have persistently abnormal glucose tolerance or insulinopenia. All five subjects with islet cell antibodies or human leukocyte antigen DR3/DR4 with initial impaired glucose tolerance have either acquired diabetes or have abnormal glucose tolerance. In contrast, only one of five subjects with initial impaired glucose tolerance but lacking these markers has persistent glucose intolerance. We conclude that in the absence of islet cell antibodies or human leukocyte antigen DR3/DR4 heterozygosity, incidental hyperglycemia or glycosuria is unlikely to be associated with progression or diabetes.\r"

In addition, we developed an event classification system based on the reason for the event being recorded. The recorder stored transthoracic impedance and electrocardiogram signals on a floppy disk before, during, and after each monitor alarm. These events on 302 disks from 83 patients were analyzed and classified as true, false, or movement-loose lead. Of 14,131 events, only 8% were caused by apnea or bradycardia (true events). Of true events, 70% were triggered by apnea and 30% by bradycardia. These true events occurred in 48% of the patients. False alarms constituted 23%, and movement-loose lead 69%, of all events. Even when movement-loose lead events were excluded, nearly three of four events were found to be false. Event recording proved helpful clinically, allowing discontinuation of the monitor in 49% of patients, modification of monitor alarm settings, or reassurance and counseling for parents.\r"

Thirty-four pregnancy terminations were performed (2.7% of the total number of acquired Toxoplasma infections during pregnancy). Fifty-two pregnancies were allowed to proceed (43 being additionally treated with pyrimethamine and sulfonamides), leading to the birth of 54 live infants. After a mean follow-up period of 19 months, 41 infants had evidence of subclinical Toxoplasma infection, 12 had a benign form, and one had severe congenital toxoplasmosis (this infant did not receive the additional treatment during pregnancy). Efficacy of the additional treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfonamides was demonstrated by a significant reduction of severe congenital toxoplasmosis and the relative decrease of the ratio of benign to subclinical forms. We recommended that spiramycin treatment be started as soon as possible once the diagnosis of maternal Toxoplasma infection during pregnancy is proved or strongly suspected, because a prolonged time interval between onset of infection and start of treatment seems to be associated with the presence of severe fetal lesions at the time of prenatal diagnosis.\r"

These studies were compared with those of a drug-free but clinically ill group of infants (n = 87) at risk for hypoxicischemic encephalopathy, and with those of infants who were well. Cranial abnormalities were detected by ultrasonography in 35.1% of the drug-exposed infants, similar to the incidence in the infants at risk for hypoxic-ischemic injury (p = 0.7) but significantly greater than the 5.3% incidence of abnormalities in normal infants (p less than 0.001). The lesions in the drug-exposed infants were intraventricular hemorrhage, echodensities known to be associated with necrosis, and cavitary lesions; they were focused in the basal ganglion, frontal lobes, and posterior fossa. The presence of ultrasonographic abnormalities was not predicted by standard neonatal clinical assessment or by other perinatal risk factors present in the drug-using population. The types of cerebral injury are consistent with those seen in adult cocaine and methamphetamine abusers and are probably related to the vasoconstrictive properties of these drugs. Antenatal exposure to stimulant drugs is associated with significant risk for cerebral injury, even among seemingly normal term neonates.\r"

We also discuss the similarities between studies of theophylline and those of other xanthines, such as caffeine, to suggest that some persons appear to have a heightened response to these substances and would benefit from closer monitoring, not only of serum drug levels but also of their consumption of food and beverages that contain caffeine. In addition, we describe strategies for examining whether a functional relationship exists between theophylline use and behavioral and psychological changes in children.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic cough in childhood has many possible causes. The two most common are asthma and viral upper respiratory infection. Although usually associated with wheezing, dyspnea, or both, cough may be the sole manifestation of asthma (\"cough-variant asthma\"). Most important to initial evaluation are physical examination, patient history, and chest radiograph. Bronchial provocation testing may also prove helpful but is usually unnecessary. A trial of antiasthma therapy is appropriate when the pattern of symptoms is typical of asthma (excepting the lack of wheezing) and when nothing incompatible with asthma is present in the clinical picture. Drug therapy for cough-variant asthma is the same as that for more typical asthma. A vigorous trial of antiasthma therapy should not be considered complete unless a short course of high oral doses of corticosteroids has been included. The presence of clinical signs or symptoms atypical or incompatible with asthma and the failure of symptoms to respond to aggressive antiasthma therapy both warrant a more aggressive and complete diagnostic study.\r"

The present study investigated the roles of D1 and D2 receptors in the regulation of copulation by microinjecting drugs selective for these receptors into the MPOA. The D2 agonist LY-163502 delayed the onset and slowed the rate of copulation and also reduced the number of vaginal intromissions required to trigger ejaculation (reduced ejaculatory threshold). The D1 agonist SKF-82526 had no effect, either alone or together with LY-163502. The D1 antagonist SCH-23390 delayed the onset of copulation and decreased ejaculatory threshold, as had the D2 agonist. A low dose of the D2 agonist alone and together with the D1 antagonist delayed the onset of copulation and reduced ejaculatory threshold; the combination of drugs was more effective than LY-163502 alone. Only the combination of drugs slowed the rate of copulation and delayed the resumption of copulation after an ejaculation. Thus, increasing the D2/D1 ratio in the MPOA, by selective stimulation of D2 and/or antagonism of D1 receptors, delays the onset of copulation and reduces ejaculatory threshold, possibly by altering autonomic control of penile reflexes.\r"

  ".W": "Serotonergic stimulation can increase the secretion of several hormones through the involvement of different serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes. RU 24969, a 5-HT agonist with highest affinity at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma renin concentration (PRC) as well as plasma corticosterone and prolactin concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Inasmuch as 5-HT2 receptors mediate the serotonergic stimulation of renin secretion, we examined the ability of two selective 5-HT2 antagonists, ritanserin and LY53857, to inhibit the neuroendocrine effects of RU 24969. To determine whether the 5-HT receptors which are involved in the stimulation of these hormones are pre- or postsynaptic, RU 24969 was also injected to rats whose brain serotonergic neurons were chemically destroyed by i.c.v. injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. Both ritanserin and LY53857 blocked the effect of RU 24969 on PRA and PRC, but did not inhibit the RU 24969-induced elevation in plasma corticosterone concentrations. Ritanserin did not inhibit the effect of RU 24969 on prolactin levels, but LY53857 produced a partial inhibition of the RU 24969-induced elevation of prolactin concentrations. In rats with chemical lesions of serotonergic neurons the dose-response curves of RU 24969 for PRA and PRC as well as corticotropin, corticosterone and prolactin shifted to the left, suggesting functional up-regulation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Potent and specific inhibitors were used to identify the enzymes involved in the in vivo degradation of LHRH. After i.c.v. administration of LHRH, only about 1% of the peptide was recovered from brain after 1 hr. Concurrent administration of LHRH and N-[1-(RS)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate (cFP-AAF-pAB), a specific inhibitor of EP 24.15, led to a more than 10-fold increase in LHRH recovery. Administration of N-[1-(RS)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Phe-pAB (cFP-F-pAB) or captopril, inhibitors of \"enkephalinase\" (EP 24.11) and angiotensin converting enzyme, respectively, did not significantly increase LHRH recovery. Intravenous administration of LHRH and either cFP-F-pAB or cFP-AAF-pAB but not captopril, led to an increase in the half-life of LHRH from 10 min to 15 and 20 min, respectively. Concurrent administration of both inhibitors resulted in a dramatic 8-fold increase in the half-life of LHRH, similar to values reported for \"superactive\" analogs of LHRH which are rendered resistant to enzymatic degradation by introduction of a D-amino acid in position 6. Concentrations of plasma LHRH 65 to 80 min after administration of inhibitors were 100- to 200-fold higher than those in controls. The potentiating effect of cFP-F-pAB resulted from inhibition of the in vivo degradation of cFP-AAF-pAB by EP 24.11.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The contractile response to L-glutamate and NMDA, but not carbamyl choline, was blocked noncompetitively by 0.6 mM Mg++. In the absence of Mg++, concentration-dependent increases in contractile force also were produced by, in order of potency, L-aspartate, L-homocysteate and D-glutamate, but not by quisqualate, kainate or quinolinate. L-Glutamate was competitively antagonized by the selective NMDA receptor antagonists D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (3 X 10(-6)-3 X 10(-5) M), as well as by the nonselective excitatory amino acid antagonist gamma-D-glutamylglycine (3 X 10(-4) M). Glutamic acid diethyl ester (3 X 10(-4) M) noncompetitively antagonized L-glutamate. L-Glutamate was not blocked by gamma-D-glutamylaminomethyl sulphonate (3 X 10(-4) M), an antagonist which preferentially antagonizes kainate and quisqualate. In addition, the phencyclidine-like drugs etoxadrol (10(-7)-10(-5) M), dextromethorphan (10(-6)-10(-5) M) and 5-methyl-10,11-dihydroxy-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine (10(-9)-10(-7) M) noncompetitively antagonized L-glutamate. The (+) isomer of 5-methyl-10, 11-dihydroxy-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine was approximately 10-fold more potent than the (-) isomer in antagonizing L-glutamate.

After each dose, heart rate and diastolic blood pressure responses to isoproterenol (0.125 micrograms/kg/min i.v. for 5 min), as well as plasma glucose, insulin, lactate and free fatty acid responses, were measured. Heart rate and free fatty acid changes were taken as beta-1 adrenergic indices, with the other parameters taken as beta-2 adrenergic indices. The antagonist dose estimated to cause 50% inhibition of each isoproterenol response (ID50) was calculated. Nebivolol and atenolol had nearly identical cardiovascular profiles, which were much more beta-1 selective than that of propranolol [heart rate and blood pressure ID50 values, mg/kg: 0.034, 0.036 (propranolol); 0.058, 0.713 (nebivolol); 0.047, 0.506 (atenolol)]. Propranolol also potently inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated glucose, insulin and lactate increases (ID50S: 0.020, 0.078 and 0.007 mg/kg, respectively). Nebivolol and atenolol were much weaker inhibitors of these metabolic responses than propranolol (5-fold-35-fold and 8-fold-greater than 90-fold, respectively). Insulin responses were equivalently inhibited by both nebivolol and atenolol (ID50S greater than 0.4 mg/kg), whereas glucose and lactate ID50S for nebivolol were 0.183 and 0.243 mg/kg, respectively, with atenolol ID50S greater than 0.64 mg/kg. Free fatty acid responses were attenuated by all three antagonists with ID50 values of 0.103, 0.100 and 0.028 mg/kg for propranolol, nebivolol and atenolol, respectively. These in vivo studies demonstrate that dl-nebivolol significantly inhibited the beta-1 cardiac response at doses which did not produce either beta-2 cardiovascular or metabolic effects.\r"

The competitive NMDA antagonists, 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate and NPC 12626 [2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoate], dose-dependently antagonized NMDA-lever selection at doses that did not affect rates of responding. Conversely, the noncompetitive NMDA antagonists, phencyclidine, MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate] and (+)-N-allylnormetazocine, as well as pentobarbital and diazepa, all reduced response rates dose-dependently without antagonism of NMDA-lever responding. In stimulus generalization tests, NPC 12626 and 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate at doses higher than those required to antagonize NMDA, often elicited NMDA-lever responding. The mechanisms underlying the similarities in the interoceptive stimuli produced by NMDA and its competitive antagonists remain to be determined. These results indicate that although competitive NMDA antagonists antagonize effects of NMDA without concomitant behavioral disruption, noncompetitive NMDA antagonists and central nervous system depressants are behaviorally disruptive at doses that do not antagonize NMDA. The results provide further evidence for differences in the behavioral profiles of competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists.\r"

N-0437 [S-(-)-2-N-propyl-N-2-thienylethylamino)-5-hydroxytetralin], a DA2 agonist, was less potent than SKF 38393 at reducing experimental gastric lesion formation, but slightly more potent at attenuating gastric secretion. The DA2 antagonist, eticlopride, was inactive in all models. Based upon these in vivo data, we suggest that: 1) the gut DA receptor may be of the DA1 subtype and 2) that activation of gut DA1 receptors produces gastroprotection by several mechanisms, at least one of which is by reducing gastric acid output.\r"

  ".W": "Most maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening programs are set up with the goal of prenatal detection of fetal neural tube defects. It is also commonly accepted that MSAFP testing yields many false-positive results. Screening programs commonly utilize schemata that identify abnormal levels of MSAFP as greater than 2.5 multiples of the median (MOM) and also recommend two abnormal values before initiating ultrasound evaluation. Our pilot program evaluating obstetric outcomes found that 21 of the 29 women with elevated MSAFP values (greater than 2.0 MOM) eventually developed significant pregnancy management changes or complications of pregnancy. Thus, we believe that the use of MSAFP screening solely for the purpose of detecting fetal neural tube defects is inconsequential relative to its usefulness in detecting other pregnancy abnormalities. We also believe that ultrasound evaluation should be accomplished after the first abnormal value and that the cutoff of 2.5 MOM should be lowered to at least 2.0.\r"

Chlamydiazyme, when compared with the DFA technique, revealed a high degree of correlation in these specimens (22 and 21 positive cervical specimens, respectively, and 7 each positive urethral specimens). Since both techniques are readily available, inexpensive and easy to perform, they should become valuable tools in the objective assessment of women at risk of this common and important sexually transmitted disease.\r"

Early studies reflected a general consensus that inflammatory atypia was normal and required no further evaluation. In the early 1970s several authors noted a higher-than-expected incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and even cervical cancer in these patients. Further work in the late 70s and early 80s demonstrated that up to 79% of patients who had both initial and repeat atypical Papanicolaou smears had CIN or worse on biopsy. Those studies were flawed in their methodology. However, recent studies have been more sound methodologically. They clearly showed that 18.79%-56.00% of initially atypical smears are associated with CIN, human papillomavirus or cervical cancer. Furthermore, they demonstrated an alarmingly high number of false-negative repeat smears. Those studies pointed to a need for a more aggressive approach to the evaluation of inflammatory atypia seen on the initial smear.\r"

Cardiovascular risk correlates positively with total serum cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride levels and inversely with HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides are an independent risk factor in women. The close correlation between cholesterol levels and myocardial infarction has been documented in population-based studies in men and women and in dietary and drug intervention trials in men. For every 1% decrease in cholesterol, there is a corresponding 2% decrease in cardiovascular risk in both sexes. For adults it is recommended that total cholesterol levels be less than 200 mg/dL. Fifty percent of women in the United States have cholesterol levels that exceed that number. Cholesterol screening, identification of high-risk individuals and early institution of overall risk management strategies are keys to reducing morbidity and mortality. Ideal therapeutic interventions are those that are lipid neutral or have a beneficial effect on the lipid profile.\r"

This discrepancy could be explained by the finding that polyethylene glycol (PEG), used in the C1qBA, enhanced the binding of rheumatoid factor IgM (RFIgM) and IgG resulting in immune complex (IC) formation. The addition of PEG to RA sera and subsequent testing of these sera in the IGPT revealed increased uptake of IC by these cells, dependent on the PEG dose. Addition of purified RFIgM to a normal human serum generated a positive IGPT in a dose dependent way. We conclude that in RA sera PEG induces IC between RFIgM and IgG. Therefore, assays devised to measure CIC in RA sera which are based on PEG (like the C1qBA) overestimate the amounts of IC present in the circulation in vivo.\r"

Five had modest improvement in strength but did not meet the criteria for improvement. All patients have subsequently required treatment with other medications. Major complications observed during therapy included serious infections in 2 patients (streptococcal endocarditis and disseminated Mycobacterium avium intracellulare) and death in one patient in which the contribution of cyclophosphamide cannot be excluded.

Sera were obtained from patients attending the University hospitals for reasons unrelated to HPV infections (controls), from patients with HPV-associated lesions, as well as from patients suffering from cervical cancer. Within the control population, 18.1% of them had antibodies that reacted with the E4 protein, and 3.9% of them had antibodies that reacted with the E7 protein. No sex-specific difference in the antibody prevalence was observed. The highest proportion of anti-E4 antibody-positive individuals (40.7%) was observed in the age group between 11 and 20 years. The frequency of anti-E4-positive sera was threefold higher in patients with HPV-associated genital lesions than that in age-matched controls. Antibodies against the HPV16 E7 protein were found 14 times more frequently in patients with cervical cancer, compared with age- and sex-matched controls (P less than .00001). From these data, we concluded that anti-E4 antibodies may be correlated with virus replication and that anti-E7 antibodies may represent a marker for cervical cancer development.\r"

  ".W": "Short-term cultures of normal human mammary epithelial cells were used to determine the extent to which c-myc, c-Ha-ras1, and c-erbB-2 proto-oncogenes were expressed in proliferating normal cells. This level of expression was compared with that of primary tumor cells, malignant effusion cells, or permanently established breast cancer cell lines. Pure preparations of epithelial organoids from seven different reduction mammoplasty tissue samples yielded proliferating normal epithelial cells upon short-term tissue culture. In every sample, proto-oncogene transcript levels increased upon short-term culture of the epithelial cells. These levels often exceeded by 10-fold the levels measured in uncultured organoids from the same tissue. In four of the seven cultured normal breast samples, at least one of the proto-oncogenes increased its expression to a level equaling or exceeding that found in a proliferating breast cancer cell line, MCF7. One effusion metastasis sample and two primary ductal adenocarcinomas were also examined for proto-oncogene expression. The effusion metastasis sample expressed high levels of c-erbB-2 messenger RNA, in accord with its amplified gene copy number; otherwise, the levels of proto-oncogene transcripts were low in unprocessed tumor and uncultured organoids, but they increased with proliferation of the tumor cells in culture. These results indicate that the variable expression of these proto-oncogenes observed in breast biopsy specimens needs to be controlled for cellular growth rate or proliferation index. Furthermore, these findings suggest that dysregulated proto-oncogene expression, rather than overexpression per se, needs to be evaluated as a possible mechanism contributing to the development of human breast cancer.\r"

CCOP represents an innovative mechanism designed to improve the accrual of patients to phase III clinical trials, involve community-based oncologists in clinical research, and potentially to disseminate new information on the state-of-the-art cancer treatment to areas distant from cancer centers and research-oriented medical centers. Examined in this evaluation of the second phase of the CCOP are the ability of the 52 currently funded CCOPs and 17 research bases to accrue patients to cancer treatment and cancer control research protocols, their influence on the patterns of practice for cancer treatment in CCOP communities, and their influence on cancer control awareness and activity among primary care physicians. The evaluation applies selected organizational perspectives to describe the intraorganizational and interorganizational characteristics of the CCOPs, research bases, and the Institute that may affect the performance of the CCOP. This organizational approach relates the accrual and influence of the CCOP to controllable aspects of the program's design and management strategies that can be changed through policies directed by the National Cancer Institute. These policies include the criteria used to select CCOPs, the role of research bases in the development and implementation of treatment and cancer control research protocols, and the use of accrual credits.\r"

  ".W": "In a phase I-II study, 28 patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma were treated with cisplatin, high-dose cytarabine (ARA-C), and caffeine. This clinical trial was based on a nude mouse-human tumor xenograft model, which demonstrated synergism of these agents by inhibiting the growth of human pancreatic tumors. Toxic effects noted in the clinical study included myelosuppression, moderate nausea and vomiting, and mild renal insufficiency. No toxic effects were directly attributable to caffeine. Eighteen of the 28 patients had measurable or assessable disease; seven (39%) had partial responses (95% confidence intervals, 18%-63%). The median response duration was 6.2 months. Median survival for responders was 9.5 months with two patients surviving for more than 18 months. Median survival for all patients was 6.1 months. The combination of cisplatin, ARA-C, and caffeine is an active and tolerable regimen in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. A phase III trial in which this regimen is being compared with standard therapy is in progress.\r"

They also inhibited the N,O-acetyltransferase-catalyzed transfer RNA binding of N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene, but they did not inhibit N,O-acetyltransferase. However, only 1,3-indandione and 1,1,1-trifluoroacetylacetone significantly inhibited the binding of N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene to transfer RNA.

  ".U": "90040836\r", 
  ".W": "The experience of six referral trauma centers with 832 blunt splenic injuries was reviewed to determine the indications, methods, and outcome of nonoperative management. During this 5-year period, 112 splenic injuries were intentionally managed by observation. There were 40 (36%) patients less than 16 years old and 72 adults. The diagnosis was established by computed tomography in 89 (79%) patients, nuclear scan in 23 (21%), ultrasound in four (4%), and arteriography in two (2%). There were 28 Class I, 51 Class II, 31 Class III, two Class IV, and no Class V splenic injuries. Nonoperative management was unsuccessful in one (2%) child and 12 (17%) adults (p less than 0.05). Failure was due to ongoing hemorrhage in 12 patients and delayed recognition of pancreatic injury in one patient. Of the 12 patients ultimately requiring laparotomy for control of hemorrhage, seven (58%) were successfully treated with splenic salvage techniques. Overall mortality was 3%; none of the four deaths was due to splenic or associated abdominal injury. This contemporary multicenter experience suggests that patients with Class I, II, or III splenic injuries after blunt trauma are candidates for nonoperative management if there is: 1) no hemodynamic instability after initial fluid resuscitation; 2) no serious associated abdominal organ injury; and 3) no extra-abdominal condition which precludes assessment of the abdomen. Strict adherence to these principles yielded initial nonoperative success in 98% of children and 83% of adults. Application of standard splenic salvage techniques to treat the patients with persistent hemorrhage resulted in ultimate splenic preservation in 100% of children and 93% of adults.\r"

The initial extent of the injury as well as the complexity of the consequent problems is staggering. As such it constitutes one of the major challenges seen by trauma surgeons. Patients surviving traumatic hemipelvectomy are rare. We found a total of 36 cases reported in this century. The University of California at Davis General Surgery Trauma Service admitted 9,369 major trauma victims from June 1985 to May 1988. During this 3-year period eight patients sustained a traumatic hemipelvectomy, of whom three survived. Given the complexity, yet rarity, of this injury, a review of the world literature was undertaken to compile collective experiences to aid surgeons in the management of this injury.\r"

The clinical followup results reported are usually disappointing. Favorable results are obtained in a vertical two-part fracture, by an open reduction and internal fixation of the tarsal navicular body fracture. In highly comminuted fractures, talo-navicular-cuneiform arthrodesis can be carried out.\r"

While confirmation of CO poisoning is easily obtained via assessment of carboxyhemoglobin (COHgb) levels, evaluation of the severity of intoxication is both difficult and inconsistent. Acute intoxication most commonly results in neurologic dysfunction and/or myocardial injury. Delayed neurologic sequelae are observed in approximately 10% of patients. New information from clinical observations and animal research has prompted a re-evaluation of the clinical assessment of the severity of CO intoxication and its resultant pathophysiology. Patients at the extremes of age (the very young and the elderly), those with pre-existing cardiovascular and/or pulmonary disease, as well as pregnancy are at increased risk. Once the diagnosis of CO poisoning has been established, treatment with 100% O2 is indicated. Based on the body of clinical, basic and scientific information currently available, patients who manifest signs of serious intoxication (i.e., unconsciousness or altered neurologic function, cardiac or hemodynamic instability) should be considered candidates for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) in addition to other appropriate supportive and intensive care. Any patient who has suffered an interval of unconsciousness, regardless of the patient's clinical exam on arrival, warrants HBO therapy. Treatment plans based on any specific COHgb level are not well founded.\r"

It is generally accepted, however, that PbFB ingestion does not pose a risk of lead toxicity, provided that the PbFB is not retained in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Recent experience with two cases substantiates this belief. On separate occasions, two 9-year old girls ingested a PbFB. The first patient developed only mild, vague GI complaints. The highest reported blood lead level (BLL) was 15 mcg/dl. The second patient did not develop symptoms, and the highest reported BLL was 22 mcg/dl. Both patients passed the PbFB in the stool within two weeks. These cases suggest that PbFB ingestions can be treated in a manner similar to other uncomplicated foreign body ingestions.\r"

When massive scrotal swelling is present ultrasound is valuable to determine the status of the underlying testis even if discrete fracture planes of the tunica cannot always be detected. To achieve best long-term results early surgical intervention should be performed in cases of rupture of the testicle and hematocele, while hematoma of the scrotal layers and purely intratesticular hematoma can be treated conservatively.\r"

  ".U": "90041025\r", 
  ".W": "High-grade (80% to 99% diameter reduction) asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenoses are associated with an increased neurologic event rate (transient ischemic attack, stroke, asymptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion) compared to less severe asymptomatic lesions. However, many do remain free of associated events. To determine which are most dangerous, we compared risk factors and duplex scan results in two groups with asymptomatic high-grade internal carotid artery stenoses. Group A included 31 patients with 33 unoperated high-grade lesions that remained asymptomatic for at least 12 months (mean 30 months). Group B included 25 patients with 26 initially asymptomatic lesions that subsequently were associated with a neurologic event (mean time to event 7.4 months). The groups did not differ significantly in average age, sex, aspirin use, smoking, or prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, or cardiac disease. With respect to the index high-grade lesion, there was no difference in the frequency of a greater than 50% contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis or greater than 50% ipsilateral external carotid stenosis. However, on duplex scanning, high-grade stenoses with greater than 6.5 kHz end-diastolic frequencies were more frequently associated with an event than high-grade lesions with lower end-diastolic frequency (p = 0.0004). Similarly, seven of 23 lesions (30%) with end-diastolic frequency greater than 6.0 kHz were associated with subsequent internal carotid artery occlusion compared to only one of 29 (3.5%) with end-diastolic frequency less than or equal to 6.0 kHz (p = 0.025). Analysis of internal carotid artery end-diastolic frequency may help select a subgroup of patients with asymptomatic high-grade lesions who are at greatest risk for subsequent neurologic symptoms or ICA occlusion or both.\r"

Eight locations, iliac, common femoral, profunda femoris, proximal and distal superficial femoral artery, proximal and distal popliteal, and tibioperoneal trunk were scored as normal versus abnormal, greater than 50% stenosis, or occluded, and occlusions were measured in centimeters. Specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy were calculated with the arteriogram as the gold standard (83% and 96%, respectively, for normal vs abnormal, 87% and 99% for 50% stenosis, and 81% and 99% for occlusions). Color flow accurately identified the presence and extent of occlusions in 48 of 51 extremities (94%) when compared to arteriography plus operative findings, since arteriography alone tended to overestimate occlusion length. It is concluded that color flow Doppler alone may be used to screen patients with peripheral vascular disease to assess candidacy for endovascular procedures without antecedent arteriography, and that arteriography alone would exclude some patients from consideration by falsely overestimating occlusion lengths.\r"

A 2 MHz pulsed-wave, range-gated transcranial Doppler was positioned at the transtemporal window after induction of general anesthesia. Mean middle cerebral artery velocity, intraarterial blood pressure, end-tidal PCO2, heart rate, and a spectral array of electroencephalographic activity were recorded continuously throughout the operation. Internal carotid artery back pressure was measured routinely. On completion of the endarterectomy, duplex ultrasound examinations and arteriograms were uniformly obtained to assess technical adequacy. Forty-nine of the 83 patients (60%) had complete preoperative and intraoperative transcranial Doppler examinations. Eleven (13%) had incomplete assessments because of small or absent transtemporal windows. Twenty-three (27%) had unsuccessful monitoring because of technical difficulties, primarily because of inability to maintain probe position--with loss of mean middle cerebral artery velocity recording. In the patients with complete studies, transcranial Doppler failed to provide information that altered surgical therapy. All monitoring modalities were normal in the one patient (1.2%) who sustained an operative stroke. We conclude that at this time, transcranial Doppler has not been useful to routinely monitor the intraoperative events during carotid endarterectomy.\r"

In the past 3 years, however, several scattered outbreaks have occurred among US schoolchildren, and there is speculation that ARF will again become a major public health problem in North America. We report a clustering of 10 cases of ARF in young men undergoing basic training at a recruit camp in San Diego, Calif. This was the first such outbreak in two decades among US military personnel and the largest reported series of ARF cases among adults in more than a decade in the United States. Adult-onset ARF was not benign in our patients. The rate of carditis (3 of 10 patients) was similar to that in older studies of adults with ARF. All patients in our series suffered severe polyarthritis, anemia, and fever, but only 60% gave any history of preceding pharyngitis. Rheumatic fever must again be suspected in adults, as well as children, who present with polyarthritis.\r"

Complete questionnaires and subsequent pregnancy outcome information was obtained in 22,776 pregnancies, 49 of which ended in a neural tube defect. The prevalence of neural tube defect was 3.5 per 1000 among women who never used multivitamins before or after conception or who used multivitamins before conception only. The prevalence of neural tube defects for women who used folic acid-containing multivitamins during the first 6 weeks of pregnancy was substantially lower--0.9 per 1000 (prevalence ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.59 compared with never users). For women who used multivitamins without folic acid during the first 6 weeks of pregnancy and women who used multivitamins containing folic acid beginning after 7 or more weeks of pregnancy, the prevalences were similar to that of the nonusers and the prevalence ratios were close to 1.0.\r"

  ".W": "Thirteen patients with phenotypic type V hyperlipidemia were treated with either gemfibrozil (Lopid) or a placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study for two 8-week periods. A 4-week baseline period of a low-fat diet preceded the study and served as a dietary control period. A 4-week washout period followed the two 8-week periods. Compared with the placebo phase, gemfibrozil produced a significant reduction in the concentrations of total plasma triglycerides (21.03 vs 5.50 mmol/L) and very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (14.40 vs 4.59 mmol/L) as well as in total plasma cholesterol levels (10.88 vs 5.62 mmol/L) and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (6.66 vs 2.15 mmol/L). Chylomicronemia was virtually abolished by the drug treatment. As expected in treated patients with type V hyperlipidemia, concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol rose after therapy with gemfibrozil (3.08 mmol/L) as compared with placebo (1.84 mmol/L); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol also increased (0.85 mmol/L after therapy with gemfibrozil, 0.62 mmol/L after placebo). The previously very low values for both of these lipoproteins increased at the same time that the total plasma cholesterol value decreased. We conclude that gemfibrozil is a well-tolerated and effective hypolipidemic agent for the treatment of patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia when used in conjunction with a low-fat diet.\r"

A review of available evidence suggests that elevations of serum levels of steroid hormones, including anabolic steroids, have profound psychological effects. Long-term, high-dose anabolic steroid use may lead to a preoccupation with drug use, difficulty stopping despite psychological side effects, and drug craving. Reductions in serum levels of steroid hormones appear to result in acute hyperadrenergic withdrawal symptoms that respond to steroid replacement or to agents that also ameliorate withdrawal symptoms in alcohol and opioid dependence. A delayed depression syndrome when serum steroid levels drop precipitously has been reported that appears similar to that observed in withdrawing cocaine-dependent individuals. We conclude that a proportion of anabolic steroid abusers may develop a previously unrecognized sex steroid hormone-dependence disorder and that treatment should be based on research into steroid effects on opioid and aminergic neurotransmission systems and relapse prevention.\r"

  ".W": "Decay accelerating factor (DAF) is a cell membrane associated glycoprotein that inhibits C3 activation. In the present study we evaluated the presence of DAF in normal (N = 15) and diseased human kidneys (N = 76). Sections of frozen tissue were stained for DAF by immunoperoxidase, utilizing three mouse monoclonal anti-DAF anti-bodies. In normal kidneys, DAF was localized in the glomerular vascular pole, apparently in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA). All other structures were negative for DAF. By contrast, in diseased kidneys, two types of abnormalities were detected. First, JGA-DAF was significantly decreased and this abnormality correlated with the pathologic diagnosis and with the presence of C3, IgM and/or fibrinogen in the glomeruli. Second, DAF was present in the glomerular mesangium (67%), renal interstitium (68%) and/or blood vessels (38%). The presence of DAF in the mesangium and interstitium of the kidney correlated with each other and correlated with C1q and C3 deposition in the glomerulus. Finally, vascular DAF was significantly more common in patients with electron dense deposits in the glomeruli. In summary, DAF is present in the normal kidney and is located exclusively in the glomerular vascular pole. In diseased kidneys, DAF tends to be lost from the JGA but is often present in glomerular mesangium, interstitium and blood vessels. This pattern is specially prominent in patients demonstrating complement deposition in the glomerulus. We speculate that kidney DAF may play a role in protecting the kidney against the products of complement activation.\r"

  ".U": "90041801\r", 
  ".W": "Estimations of proximal tubule sodium reabsorption with the FELi method come closer to direct measurements than any other indirect method. There is little doubt that most lithium reabsorption takes place in the proximal tubules, very likely in proportion to the reabsorption of sodium and water. It is also likely that changes in proximal tubule sodium reabsorption due to changes in volume status are paralleled by changes in proximal tubule lithium reabsorption, at least in the superficial nephrons. Nonetheless, changes in FELi probably do not purely reflect changes in proximal reabsorption, since lithium is also handled beyond the proximal tubules. Acknowledged problems are lithium reabsorption in Henle's loop and in the late distal and collecting tubules. The latter occurs in the rat and the dog, but not or much less in men. Sodium restriction enhances this lithium transport considerably. It is as yet uncertain whether other conditions, such as increased vasopressin activity or lowering of renal perfusion pressure, also influence this transport. Amiloride appears to prevent this reabsorption of lithium. Therefore, this drug can be used in lithium clearance studies whenever unwanted \"distal\" lithium reabsorption is expected. Lithium reabsorption in Henle's loop forms a greater problem as it cannot be prevented by any drug without influencing proximal tubule reabsorption. It is estimated that about 7% of the filtered lithium (one-tenth of total lithium reabsorption) is normally taken up here, preferentially in deep nephrons. In view of studies with furosemide, this reabsorption probably varies with sodium intake, but the proportion of this variation to that of proximal tubule lithium reabsorption is obscure. This remains an uncertain factor in any circumstance where the lithium clearance method is used. In some conditions the change in FELi may be so large relative to the expected changes in proximal reabsorption, that use of FELi as marker of end-proximal solute delivery seems unjustified. Disproportionately large suppression is likely during mineralo-corticoid-induced volume expansion, and stimulation during prostaglandin synthesis inhibition and vasopressin. Based on observations in these conditions the potential range of lithium reabsorption in the loop of Henle would be 0 to 15% of filtered load. In this review attention was paid mainly to the validity of lithium clearance as a pure \"proximal marker\". Many of our interpretations suffer from incomplete certainty with respect to the renal effects of tested maneuvers, a problem which is acknowledged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This suggests, in accordance with the animal model, that these macrophages are changed proportionately in CAPD patients. This chronic change may be caused by mechanical stimulation alone (massage) or the composition of the dialysis fluid used. Therefore in the rat model both physiological saline and commercial dialysis fluid were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administrated. Our results on the PA-pattern of peritoneal macrophages do indicate that a single i.p. administration of commercial dialysis fluid induced an acute exudate, especially when compared with the minor saline effect. These results are confirmed by the percentage of macrophages positive for a differentiation antigen recognized by the monoclonal antibody ED2. In addition the percentage of Fc-receptor positive peritoneal cells is more enhanced after i.p. injection of dialysis fluid when compared with the saline effect. These findings strongly suggest that the dialysis fluid used in peritoneal dialysis patients is the inducer of exudate peritoneal macrophages in these patients.\r"

We evaluated the role of native kidneys in post-transplant hypertension using a rat model in which the confounding variables of rejection and immunosuppression could be eliminated. To produce disease in native kidneys. PVG rats were subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy. Four weeks following renal ablation, these hypertensive animals were transplanted with kidneys from syngeneic PVG donors. Four weeks later, the effects of captopril and native nephrectomy on blood pressure and renal hemodynamics were examined. Animals with remnant native kidneys which received non-rejecting renal isografts had sustained hypertension, elevated plasma renin levels and reduced transplant function. In these animals, administration of captopril reduced systemic blood pressure. Despite the reduction in blood pressure, PAH clearance by the transplanted kidney increased markedly while GFR rose modestly. Removal of the remnant native kidney also acutely lowered blood pressure. However, compared to captopril, native nephrectomy produced a more marked increase in GFR without significantly affecting renal blood flow. In this model of post-transplant hypertension in the rat, elevated blood pressure and reduced isograft function are mediated by the diseased native kidney, in part through the effects of angiotensin II. These data suggest that ACE inhibitors and native nephrectomy may have beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with post-transplant hypertension caused by native kidneys.\r"

This model has been shown to be associated with markedly elevated urinary excretion of C5b-9, compared to other experimental models of glomerulonephritis To determine if urinary C5b-9 excretion could serve as an index of disease activity by correlating with the formation and quantity of glomerular subepithelial immune deposits in PHN, we measured urinary excretion of C5b-9 in PHN under several experimental conditions. In the heterologous phase a direct correlation was demonstrated between levels of urinary C5b-9 excretion and the amount of anti-Fx1A IgG deposited in glomeruli (r = 0.85). In the autologous phase, C5b-9 excretion correlated with the amount of deposit forming antibody present in the serum and resolved when antibody disappeared, despite persistence of glomerular deposits of antigen, antibody, C5b-9 and heavy proteinuria. Glomerular C3 deposits paralleled urinary C5b-9 excretion. Re-initiation of active deposit formation by a second injection of anti-Fx1A produced new C3 deposits and a marked rise in C5b-9 excretion. Finally, complete abrogation of deposit formation by transplanting PHN kidneys into normal recipients also halted C5b-9 excretion. Our findings demonstrate that urinary excretion of C5b-9 is a sensitive index of on-going immunologic disease activity in the PHN model of membranous nephropathy.\r"

Protein phosphorylation mediated by PKA inhibits the Na+-H+ exchanger while that mediated by PKC stimulates activity. The effect of PKA and PKC on the Na+-H+ exchanger in native membranes and in solubilized brush border membrane proteins appears to be consistent with most of the published observations in intact cells. Further studies using solubilized, renal brush border membrane proteins indicated that protein phosphorylation mediated by CaM-kinase II inhibited the activity of the Na+-H+ exchanger. The physiologic significance of this observation in intact cells remains to be determined. It is hoped that the types of experimental approaches outlined in this review will yield additional insights into the structure of the Na+-H+ exchanger and to a clearer understanding of its physiologic regulation.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the impact of differing antihypertensive regimens on the development of renal injury, studies were performed in three groups of moderately hyperglycemic diabetic rats, and one group of non-diabetic control (C) rats. One diabetic group (DM) received no therapy except insulin. The remaining diabetic groups received insulin and either the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP), or triple therapy (TRX) with reserpine, hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide. CAP and TRX modestly and comparably lowered blood pressure. At 6 to 10 weeks, DM rats exhibited elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR), due to elevations of the glomerular capillary plasma flow rate (QA) and the glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC). In both DM/CAP and DM/TRX rats, blood pressure reduction was associated with selective normalization of PGC, without change in SNGFR or QA. In long-term (70 weeks) studies, DM rats exhibited progressive albuminuria and marked glomerular sclerosis. CAP limited albuminuria and injury to values even lower than those in C rats, whereas TRX served only to delay, but not to prevent, the increase in albuminuria. TRX reduced glomerular sclerosis, but was less effective than CAP. At 70 weeks, CAP and TRX still reduced systemic blood pressure; PGC remained at normal levels with CAP but was no longer controlled with TRX. These results confirm the clinical observation that antihypertensive therapy slows diabetic glomerulopathy, but also suggest that CAP affords superior long-term protection as compared to the other antihypertensive drug regimen studied.\r"

Four strains of mice with the susceptible H-2 type, H-2d, but different non-H-2 genes were studied. B10, D2, Balb/c, NZB, and DBA/2J mice were injected with 4 mg of apoferritin i.p. q.d. for 28 days. B10, D2 and Balb/c mice developed proliferative and crescentic glomerulonephritis. NZB mice developed proliferative and crescentic glomerulonephritis with wire loop lesions suggestive of lupus. DBA/2J mice developed only minimal mesangial proliferation without crescents or necrosis. Electron microscopy showed subepithelial and mesangial deposits in B10, D2, moderate subepithelial and mesangial deposits in Balb/c, and marked mesangial, subendothelial and subepithelial deposits in NZB. Immunofluorescence demonstrated the presence of IgG, IgM, C3 and apoferritin in these deposits. The DBA/2J mice had only minimal mesangial deposits by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. These experiments demonstrate that non-H-2 genes alter the H-2d determined disease susceptibility seen in H-2 congenic mice. NZB genes can alter the disease so that lupus-like lesions develop and DBA/2J genes can substantially ameliorate the disease.\r"

Following LPS infusion, a significant decrease (8%) in mean BP was observed only in the LPS 0127:B8 treated group. Inulin clearance fell 57% (LPS 0111:B4), P less than 0.01, and 38% (LPS 0127:B8), P less than 0.01. Para-aminohippuric (PAH) clearance decreased 31% (P less than 0.01) and total effective renal vascular resistance rose 70% (P less than 0.03) in response to LPS 0111:B4. No significant change in PAH clearance was noted in the LPS 0127:B8 group. Superficial single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) was reduced 69% (LPS 0111:B4), P less than 0.03, and 33% (LPS 0127:B8), P less than 0.02. Superficial glomerular plasma flow fell 48% (LPS 0111:B4), P less than 0.03, and 24% (LPS 0127:B8), P less than 0.03. Both lipopolysaccharides were associated with an increase in afferent arteriolar resistance (RA) which accounted for a reduction in the glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC). There was no change in the proximal tubular pressure in either group and, therefore, the net transcapillary hydraulic pressures were reduced. No measurable change in the ultrafiltration coefficient. Kf, was observed in either group. In a second set of protocols, the effect of prior administration of indomethacin or captopril on LPS 0111:B4 action was investigated. A significant decrease in BP occurred when animals were pretreated with captopril. Both indomethacin and captopril prevented the renal effects of LPS 0111:B4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast to C5-sufficient (C5S) mice. C5-deficient (C5D) mice can neither generate C5a nor assemble C5b-9. After four weeks of treatment, DOCA-C5S and -C5D mice developed similar degrees of hypertension; mice receiving no DOCA remained normotensive. Only hypertensive mice developed glomerular injury. Hypertensive DOCA-C5D mice developed more glomerular capillary loop dilatation and larger glomerular capillary tuft volumes than DOCA-C5S mice (1.0 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.03 X 10(6) microns 3, respectively, P less than 0.05). However, DOCA-C5S mice, compared to DOCA-C5D mice, had significantly more glomerular cell proliferation (64.5 +/- 2 vs. 42 +/- 3 nuclei/glomerulus), cell necrosis (injury score 22 +/- 1 vs. 17 +/- 1), extracapillary proliferation (26 +/- 4 vs. 2.5 +/- 2% of glomeruli) and proteinuria (5.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.5 mg/24 hr; all P less than 0.05). By immunofluorescence microscopy both DOCA-C5S and -C5D had mesangial C3 deposits but only DOCA-C5S mice had C9 deposits. After 16 weeks of DOCA-NaCl C5S mice, in comparison to C5D mice, had more severe glomerulosclerosis (injury score 50 +/- 6 vs. 12 +/- 4), proteinuria (16.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 9 +/- 0.1 mg/24 hr), and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 0.25 vs. 0.15 mg/dl), all P less than 0.05. These changes occurred despite levels of hypertension that were similar in DOCA-NaCl C5S and C5D throughout the whole study period. We conclude that C5a and/or C5b-9 may play an important role in hypertensive glomerular injury. Moreover, these studies demonstrate that differences in host responses may determine target organ susceptibility to similar injurious mechanisms.\r"

Although the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) is essential for initiating the scarring process, the bacterial structures responsible for their activation have not been investigated. In an animal model of chronic pyelonephritis the surface area of the renal scars produced by Type 1 fimbriate escherichia coli (E. coli) was significantly greater than that of those produced by P fimbriate and non-fimbriate strains (P less than 0.01). The activation of human PMN by the same Type 1 fimbriate organisms resulted in a significant release of lysosomal neutral protease activity (P less than 0.001) and activation of the respiratory burst (P less than 0.01). The neutral protease release in response to P fimbriate and non-fimbriate organisms was not significantly increased. The extent of renal scarring also correlated with the release of neutral protease activity (P less than 0.02) and with the degree of activation of the respiratory burst (P less than 0.05). These results demonstrate that the ability of E. coli strains to cause renal scars may be related to their capacity to express Type 1 fimbria, which may be a causative factor in the in vivo activation of the inflammatory response.\r"

Approximately 25% of the total AP content of renal tissue at the transition between cortex and medulla was of the intestinal type; the remainder was of the tissue-unspecific type (liver, bone, kidney AP). Immunoperoxidase staining using specific monoclonal antibodies against liver and intestinal AP revealed that the tissue-unspecific AP isoenzyme is present through-out the different segments of the proximal tubule, whereas intestinal-type AP is found exclusively in tubuloepithelial cells of the S3-segment of the proximal tubule. The intestinal-type enzyme obtained from the kidney had a similar heat stability and Km value, and similar immunologic and inhibitory (L-p-bromotetramisole; L-phenylalanine) characteristics compared to adult intestinal and fetal intestinal AP. Its electrophoretic mobility in agarose gel was intermediate between that of adult intestinal and fetal intestinal AP; after neuraminidase treatment it became indistinguishable from the adult intestinal isoenzyme. The intestinal-type AP found in the urine was not sensitive to neuraminidase and had a molecular weight significantly lower than the urinary tissue-unspecific AP isoenzyme. In conclusion, intestinal AP in the kidney is a specific marker for the brush border of the S3 segment of the proximal tubule, and this finding opens new perspectives in the cell biology of this particular part of the nephron.\r"

All studies were performed just before dialysis when subjects were relatively volume-expanded. Hypotensives had higher PRA (5.7 +/- 2.4 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.8 ng AI/ml/hr, P less than 0.05). AII (56 +/- 15 vs. 31 +/- 3 pg/ml), and aldosterone (91 +/- 35 vs. 21 +/- 7 ng/dl, P less than 0.05) than did normotensives. During AII infusion at 1, 3, 10, and 30 ng/kg/min for 15 minutes each, hypotensives displayed a significantly blunted pressor effect across the range of AII doses. In parallel with this, hypotensives showed reduced AII receptors on their platelets compared to normotensives (0.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.0% 125I-AII specifically bound; P less than 0.03). Binding analysis revealed a single affinity state for the AII receptors which was similar in both groups (Kd = 3.2 +/- 1.1 for hypotensives vs. 3.8 +/- 0.7 x 10(-10) M for normotensives). The two groups had similar levels of plasma catecholamines, similar slowing of heart rate during AII infusion and no postural hypotension, indicating intact sympathetic nervous system pathways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Colloid solution is commonly used to increase the oncotic pressures of priming solutions used in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. To study the effectiveness of this practice, we prospectively randomized 100 adult patients undergoing cardiac operations to receive Ringer's lactate solution plus 50 gm of albumin (group A) or Ringer's lactate solution alone (group B) as the prime solution for the bypass circuit. Personnel involved in the management of these patients were blinded concerning the group to which the patients had been randomized. Forty clinical parameters related to perioperative fluid balance, cardiopulmonary function, and renal function were studied. Although group B received a larger volume of crystalloid solution intraoperatively (p less than 0.05), had a lower mean cardiac filling pressure (p less than 0.05), and had a higher hematocrit value (p less than 0.05) in the immediate postoperative period, all mean values for both groups were within the normal range. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to postoperative clinical parameters of cardiopulmonary and renal function, nor was outcome affected by the addition of albumin to the prime solution. We conclude that there is no clinically detectable advantage for the practice of adding 50 gm of albumin to the priming solution of bypass circuits in adults undergoing cardiac operations. Routinely supplementing the bypass prime solution with albumin adds significant cost, estimated to be approximately $10,000 per 100 cases, without demonstrable clinical benefits. Whether this practice can be of value in selected cases needs to be further studied.\r"

Twenty-four patients undergoing elective coronary bypass were studied. After 10-minute periods of stability at moderate hypothermia (28 degrees +/- 1 degrees C), blood samples were aspirated from the arterial and venous lines. Samples were analyzed for oxygen content, saturation, and tension, pH, base excess, and lactate. Systemic oxygen uptake was significantly greater at 2.0 than 1.5 L.min-1 m-2 by 18 (7, 30) ml.min-1.m-2, whereas it was not significantly affected by change in flow character (-4[-16, 7] ml.min-1.min-2) or arterial pH (-2 [-12, 8] ml.min-1.m-2 per 0.1 pH unit). Venous oxygen tension, saturation, and content were significantly increased at the higher compared with the lower flow rate (p less than 0.05), whereas arterial oxygen tension and oxygen extraction were not. Increases in arterial oxygen content and saturation from low to high flow rates were marginally nonsignificant (F = 4.08, critical value = 4.17; F = 3.99 critical value = 4.21). Base excess was significantly affected by alteration in arterial pH but not flow rate, flow character, or stage (p less than 0.05). Lactate concentrations were unaffected by flow rate, flow character, or arterial pH, but there was a small but significant overall decrease during the course of cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.05). Reasons why systemic oxygen uptake was affected by flow rate but not by flow character or arterial pH are discussed. A flow rate of 1.5 L.min-1.m-2 during cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia results in a less than maximal systemic oxygen uptake.\r"

The delightful triumph of the \"doers\" in Rehn's suture of a stab wound and Souttar's intracardiac mitral valve manipulations is saluted. The brave but disappointing adventures of Doyan, Duval, Tuffier, Carrel, Graham, Beck, and Cutler are noted. The unique role of heart surgery in the change from extirpative to physiologic surgery is illustrated by the spectrum ranging from Blalock and Taussig to intracardiac surgery to pacemakers. The question of \"why not?\" have cardiac surgery before World War II led to experimental designs for extirpation of bacterial endocarditic vegetations. These studies became obsolete because of the merciful correction by penicillin. They were reapplied to the removal of shell fragments in World War II. This was the first consistently successful intracardiac surgery and led to the closed correction of mitral stenosis and other conditions. Heart surgery now stands as the model for physiologic surgery and the actuarial forms of follow-up to tell all medical and surgical successors more about the basic \"what and when\" for better health care delivery.\r"

  ".W": "In 1951 in our laboratory in Stockholm, we successfully used our experimental pump oxygenator: the first dogs survived 40 minutes of total cardiopulmonary bypass with right ventricular cardiotomy. In the same year extracorporeal circulation was combined with hypothermia (26 degrees to 28 degrees C) to allow lower perfusion flows, thus diminishing blood trauma and the risk of perfusion complications. To avoid air emboli during cardiotomies, the heart was \"arrested\" with electrically induced ventricular fibrillation (1952). Our standard perfusion technique used cooling and rewarming with left ventricular bypass, the oxygenator was used only during intracardiac manipulations and when the right ventricle was unable to maintain a sufficient pulmonary circulation. Left ventricular bypass was continued until normal body temperature was reached and the heart could be weaned off the pump. In July 1954 we successfully extirpated a left atrial myxoma in our first patient undergoing open heart surgery, a 40-year-old woman, who is still alive today. Other successful applications of open heart surgery involved resection of a huge left ventricular aneurysm after infarction in 1955, correction of supracardiac total anomalous venous return in 1956, and the first hemodynamic correction of transposition of the great arteries by atrial switch method in 1958. Also in 1958, the first totally implantable pacemaker was inserted in a patient with total atrioventricular block to eliminate the infections that occurred along the percutaneous pacemaker leads. In October 1958, we also operated on a patient with severe angina pectoris with stenosis of the left anterior descending and circumflexed arteries and occluded right coronary artery. Endarterectomy of the left coronary arteries was performed, and the arteriotomies were repaired with saphenous vein patches.\r"

Twenty-three of these 154 Lillehei trainees became program directors of cardiothoracic programs and in turn trained 477 additional surgeons. Twenty-one of these second-generation trainees became program directors and trained 164 surgeons. Two of these third-generation trainees have become directors and have in turn trained 25 additional trainees. A total of at least 820 cardiothoracic surgeons, currently residing in 36 countries, can trace their preceptor lineage back to Dr. Lillehei. A number of significant clinical and research contributions have been forthcoming from these Lillehei trainees during the past 35 years.\r"

  ".W": "Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection to the right side of the heart often complicates surgery for atrial septal defects. Between 1964 and 1987, 39 patients, ranging from 2 to 52 years old, underwent repair of partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection. At least one anomalous pulmonary vein arose from the right upper lobe in 38 patients and right middle lobe in 30 patients and connected to the superior vena cava in 28 patients and the right atrium only in 11 patients. An atrial septal defect was present in 32 patients (82%). Patients who had partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection to the superior vena cava-right atrium junction, the right atrium or both were treated by septal translocation (two patients) or patch redirection of the anomalous pulmonary venous flow to the left atrium through a native atrial septal defect (eight patients) or a surgically created atrial septal defect in two patients with intact atrial septum. For partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection to the high superior vena cava (27 patients), the superior vena cava was transected and oversewn above the anomalous veins. The anomalous pulmonary venous flow was redirected through the proximal superior vena cava into the left atrium across a sinus venous atrial septum defect (22 patients) or a surgically created atrial septal defect in five patients with intact atrial septum. The atrial septal defect was coapted to the intracardiac orifice of the superior vena cava, and the distal superior vena cava was anastomosed to the right atrial appendage. One 31-year-old woman with severe pulmonary hypertension died early and was the only death in the series. A technical error early in the series resulted in one symptomatic superior vena cava obstruction. Only one patient remains in sick sinus syndrome late. All patients remain well over long follow-up (1 to 24 years). Postoperative catheterization or echocardiography has revealed no intracardiac defects, pulmonary venous obstruction, or superior vena cava obstruction (except the one technical error). Correction of partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection should be individualized according to the site of connection of the anomalous pulmonary veins and the location of the atrial defect to minimize undesirable postoperative sequelae often associated with other methods of repair.\r"

We evaluated the use of combined antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in 59 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Nineteen patients were administered antegrade cardioplegia, whereas 40 patients were administered antegrade plus retrograde cardioplegia. Hemodynamic data were obtained before the onset of cardiopulmonary bypass and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours after cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Myocardial function was assessed by measuring systemic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac index, pulmonary artery pressure, and capillary wedge pressure. Both cohorts were similar in age, incidence of hypertension, diabetes, and previous myocardial infarction. No significant differences were noted in the need for postoperative inotropic support, the incidence of postoperative arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart block, or death. The two groups were similar with respect to cardiac index and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. However, the left ventricular stroke work index, when expressed as a function of its prebypass control value, was significantly improved (p less than 0.01) in the cohort administered combined cardioplegia. In the combined group recovery of left ventricular stroke work index occurred earlier and was more complete. These results suggest that the use of combined antegrade/retrograde cardioplegia is safe and may provide superior protection.\r"

The 7-month-old infants shared a large sagittal venous sinus that precluded conventional neurosurgical approach because of risk of exsanguination and air embolism. After craniotomy and preliminary exposure of the sinus, each twin underwent sternotomy and total cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermia. Hypothermic circulatory arrest allowed safe division and subsequent reconstruction of the sinus remnants. Several unusual problems were encountered, including transfusion of a large blood volume from one extracorporeal circuit to the other through the common venous sinus, deleterious warming of the exposed brain during circulatory arrest, and thrombosis of both pump oxygenators. Both infants survived, although recovery was complicated in each by neurologic injury, cranial wound infection, and hydrocephalus. This case demonstrates the valuable supportive role of cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermic circulatory arrest in the management of complex surgical problems of otherwise inoperable patients.\r"

Advanced engineering development in response to users has narrowed this gap with the Omni design (Omniscience titanium and omnicarbon Pyrolite cages). Our studies on mitral Omniscience valves demonstrated that because anatomic and surgical variations, the anterior orientation was more forgiving than the posterior orientation, resulting in lower thrombotic complications (0.5% versus 3.3% patient-year). A subsequent thicker cuff was used to reduce the probability of anatomic interference and incomplete opening after cardiac recovery. Such findings were also incorporated in the Omnicarbon design. Five European centers implanted 354 patients (198 atrial valve replacement, 115 mitral valve replacement, and 41 double valve replacement with Omniscience valves between August 1984 and January 1986. No restrictive patient selection criteria were used. As of June 1987, 96% of the patients at risk were accounted for. Average follow-up was 1.7 +/- 0.4 years (range, 0.3 to 2.8 years), with a total follow-up of 555 years. There were no cases of structural failure or clinically significant hemolysis. Ninety-one percent of the patients improved one or more functional classes. Actuarial analysis of survival probability at 3 years is 92.5% for atrial valve replacement, 97.9% for mitral valve replacement, and 93.6% overall. There were no late deaths from valve thrombosis or thromboembolism. The actuarial freedom from all thromboembolic events (valve thrombosis, thromboembolism, and transient ischemia) is 97.8% at 2 1/2 years. Through close rapport between user surgeons and designers, the evolution of a valve with improved performance becomes a reality.\r"

The potential risks associated with an invasive cardiac procedure or surgical intervention must always be considered along with the potential benefits of such a procedure in an attempt to reduce the cardiac risk of noncardiac operations. Aggressive and conscientious preoperative assessment and perioperative care of the high-risk patient by the concerted efforts of the medical consultant, anesthesiologist, and surgeon may substantially diminish cardiac-related morbidity and mortality during noncardiac surgical procedures.\r"

Most likely, TRALI is a type of ARDS although it is associated with a much lower morbidity and mortality than found with classic ARDS. For years, the pathogenesis of ARDS has been explained by the complement hypothesis in which pulmonary neutrophilic sequestration and degranulation follow complement-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis. A definitive role for the neutrophil in diffuse, acute lung injury, however, has not been established. Although numerous chemoattractants for neutrophils are generated in the lungs and, through degranulation and formation of toxic oxygen free radicals, the neutrophil is fully capable of causing tissue injury, substantial evidence refutes the requirement for neutrophils in diffuse, acute lung injury. Other potential factors in the pathogenesis of ARDS include primary endothelial cell injury, alveolar macrophage activity, and hemostatic disorders.\r"

Seventy per cent of deaths from falls occur in the elderly population. Morbidity from falls includes fractures, soft tissue trauma, anxiety about further falls, and loss of confidence. Falls are due to environmental factors; neurologic illness including dementia, drop attacks, and sensory loss; alcohol and drug use; orthostatis; cardiac arrhythmias; and acute illnesses such as infection, heart failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The physician who treats elderly patients needs to identify those patients at risk or those who already have the problem. Evaluation should not be limited to assessment for injury and must include establishing an etiology. Therapy depends upon determining the precise etiology for the fall and rectifying contributing factors.\r"

Prevention of recurrence involves a careful consideration of differential diagnosis, treatment of contributory disease, and the initiation of therapy specific to large vessel infarction (atherothrombotic or cardiogenic embolic), lacunar infarction, or intracerebral hemorrhage. The high prevalence of lacunar infarction and the focal nature of posterior circulation transient ischemic attacks and strokes are not generally appreciated. Cardiogenic embolism due to atrial fibrillation and intracerebral hemorrhage due to congophilic angiopathy are of particular importance in the elderly. Treatment of stroke or transient ischemic attacks should be initiated quickly as the risk of recurrence is highest immediately following the signal event. History, neurologic and neurobehavioral examinations are important adjuncts in compensating for the inadequacy of CT and MRI in enabling the stroke classification necessary for proper treatment. Supportive care and rehabilitation can have a major impact on stroke morbidity and mortality and the management of risk factors can significantly reduce stroke incidence.\r"

  ".W": "Many gaps still exist in our understanding of the etiology and the management of dementing disorders. However, there are fairly well established guidelines for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, the major cause of acquired cognitive disorders in the elderly. The management of patients with dementing disorders should involve the entire family. The medical needs pale beside the functional and psychosocial issues. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach in a team setting is ideal, where goals can be established and coordinated and communication with the family, patient, and consultants can be facilitated. Patients and family members need to know that life beyond the diagnosis can be meaningful. With the help of support groups, they learn to maximize the positive aspects and can cope with the struggle ahead. It should not be forgotten, however, that not all families had good relationships before the onset of the decline and often are in great need of counseling to manage the anger and guilt they will often experience. Future research is needed not only on the search for better medical treatments but also on the establishment of guidelines for the physician and family to deal with complex social issues such as when one is no longer safe to drive an automobile. Prospective studies on victims of head injury could establish the link of trauma to Alzheimer's disease, that has been proposed. The role of physicians in public policy for prevention of high risk behaviors (such as boxing) is controversial, but at the very least, physicians should play a major role in educating their patients of these dangers. Because of the rapid aging of our population, pressure for research and policy changes in national health and long term care financing has been growing, largely due to the impressive efforts of the Alzheimer's Association. In order to give the kind of attention that is required in the care of these patients, there must be a change in the present system of reimbursement. This will never happen, unless it can be demonstrated that lower costs of health care can be achieved by anticipating the needs of these patients and their families. It is quite possible that costs can be reduced by delaying the need for nursing home placement or decreasing utilization of emergency medical care and hospitalization. However, these assumptions must be investigated further.\r"

Unlike younger patients, the aged present later in the course of their disease and also often have concomitant underlying diseases. The diagnosis of an acute abdomen is further complicated by the relative lack of physical findings which is due to the elderly's lack of pain perception. The surgical problems in the elderly also tend to be more rapidly life-threatening than in younger patients. This further emphasizes the need for rapid diagnosis should an elderly patient present with abdominal pain. Methods to decrease the mortality from acute surgical problems are limited, but are potentially very effective. The first is to arrange for elective correction of the problem should it be known, and the second is to refer the patients promptly for operative consideration before sepsis becomes firmly established. Exact diagnosis before referral, while intellectually satisfying, is often contributory to a poor outcome in these patients.\r"

Low urinary flow rate, difficulty with catheterization, slow bladder filling or severe urgency, bladder capacity over 600 ml, and post-void residual over 150 ml need referral. Patients with hematuria, recurrent infections, recent surgery or pelvic irradiation, and pelvic or prostatic masses also need further evaluation. A number of medical and behavioral therapies are available for stress incontinence and detrusor instability that can substantially reduce incontinence, but most patients with overflow have more complicated problems requiring further evaluation, surgery, or long-term bladder drainage.\r"

The physician must therefore be familiar with the characteristic findings in such patients and be able to recognize complications as they arise. Mechanical or local problems, such as asymptomatic bacteriuria, catheter blockage, nondeflatable balloon, and chronic cystitis, are very common. Further studies are needed to define optimum measures to control these problems. The clinician must be aware that pyuria and bacteriuria are universal and not helpful in diagnosis of infection in this population. Use of chronic antibiotics is not recommended and there is no evidence to support elaborate daily care regimens, such as antibiotic ointments or irrigations. Careful consideration of the indications for catheter use on a long-term basis may reduce the population at risk. Physician awareness of the possibility of life-threatening complications, such as squamous cell carcinoma, bacteremia, and bladder perforation, can help avoid serious consequences of the use of urinary drainage devices.\r"

Although increasing bone content should reduce the rate of osteoporotic fracture, attention should also be paid to other factors (such as falling). Loss of bone mass is a universal phenomenon with aging, and currently we are not able to use risk factor analysis to accurately predict which people are likely to suffer osteoporotic fracture. Bone densitometry cannot be recommended as a useful screening test in elderly patients. When deciding about treatment of osteoporosis in the elderly, it should be noted that few studies have included patients over 75 years of age and that prevention of bone loss is more effective than restoration of lost bone. Although high-dose calcium appears ineffective, patients ingesting low amounts of calcium should be counselled to increase their daily intake to at least 800 mg. Estrogens are very effective at preserving bone mass at least up to age 70 years, and their use is associated with a reduction in hip fractures. Vitamin D at a dose of 600 to 800 IU per day should be given to elderly subjects who do not get significant exposure of their skin to sunlight. Other specific recommendations regarding the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis await the results of further investigation.\r"

Thus, it is of benefit to reduce the blood pressure in hypertensive older patients. There is some evidence that the elderly may not be more susceptible to side effects of antihypertensive medications than younger populations. However, it is certainly reasonable to attempt blood pressure control by nonpharmacologic means prior to drug treatment. Demographic considerations may affect the choice of medication; in general the stepped-care approach will provide effective management of elevated blood pressure in this population.\r"

The relationship of hypogonadism to impotence is uncertain. Medications and neurologic diseases (both central and peripheral) are other major causes of impotence. The treatment of impotence has been revolutionized with the widespread availability of vacuum tumescent devices. The alterations in female sexuality with advancing age have been less well studied. Hysterectomies and bilateral oophorectomies are most probably done more often than necessary in the United States and may alter sexuality. There is some evidence supporting a role for estrogens and testosterone in the regulation of female libido. Physicians need to be more aware of the rapid changes in our understanding of human sexuality and aging.\r"

Preventive care includes use of assessment tools to identify high risk patients, frequent repositioning, air or foam mattresses that reduce pressure over bony prominences, as well as careful attention to optimizing the overall patient condition. When pressure ulcers do develop, the treatment plan should include adequate nutrition including protein, vitamin C, and zinc supplements as indicated; systemic antibiotics for sepsis, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, or the prevention of bacterial endocarditis; and local wound care that eliminates necrotic tissue, decreases bacterial load, and provides a physiologic, pressure-free environment allowing the wound to heal. Specialized beds may be considered in some patients, particularly those with larger ulcers. Surgery is an option in older persons who are operative candidates. For some patients with pressure ulcers, appropriate treatment goals may focus on providing comfort rather than curing the ulcer.\r"

Drug toxicity was not a great problem; the treatment was permanently discontinued in only 2% of patients. There was no significant difference at the end of months 5 and/or 6 of chemotherapy between the groups treated daily and twice-weekly in the proportions with bacteriological failure (at least one positive sputum culture with more than 20 colonies) or who had died from tuberculosis (17 [6%] vs 10 [3%]). Nor was there a significant difference in the relapse rate (17 [7%] treated daily vs 10 [4%] treated twice-weekly) during follow-up of 12 months. Thus, the twice-weekly regimen was at least as effective as the daily regimen for treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.\r"

The definitive diagnosis was established by surgery (in 39 patients), by transendoscopic sphincterotomy (11 patients), or by retrograde biliary opacification (2 patients). Endosonography was significantly more sensitive than ultrasonography or CT (100% vs 80% and 83%, respectively) in making a positive diagnosis of obstruction. Endosonography was also significantly more accurate than ultrasonography or CT (97% vs 49% and 66%) in diagnosing the cause of the obstruction and more effective in the assessment of the locoregional spread of tumorous obstructions (75% vs 38% and 62%). Thus, endosonography was superior to ultrasonography and CT in the diagnosis and staging of biliary obstructions.\r"

Initially, these patients were managed with either wide local excision or surgical excision of the primary tumor combined with radical neck dissection. There was a minimum of 3 years of follow-up. Chi-square contingency tables and Fisher's Exact Test were used to correlate histopathologic parameters with lymph-node metastasis.

Selection of therapy depends on an accurate radiographic assessment of the extent of tumor. The tumor's local aggressiveness, high rate of recurrence, associated malignancy, and multicentric tendency have led most workers to advocate radical surgical removal of the tumor by lateral rhinotomy and en bloc resection of the ethmoid labyrinth. Radiographic evaluation by computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging permits identification of a small group of patients who have limited lesions and may be candidates for conservative tumor resection by intranasal or transantral sphenoethmoidectomy. Among our ten patients treated with conservative surgery, there was recurrence in one case (10%). Seventy-five patients underwent rhinotomy and medial maxillectomy, with seven cases recurring (9%). The overall recurrence rate was 9% (8 of 87). Among the 87 cases, 5 patients had carcinoma (6%). The literature is reviewed and the principles of case selection and management are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We introduce acoustic rhinometry as a new, objective method to assess the geometry of the nasal cavity. The cross-sectional area of the nasal cavity as a function of distance from the nostrils was obtained. A group of 21 patients with septal deformities was examined with acoustic rhinometry preoperatively and postoperatively. These values were compared with those of 21 normal control subjects. The minimal cross-sectional area (MCA) is located in the anterior part of the nose, and it shifts anteriorly under the effect of decongestion. The preoperative value of MCA is related to the location and severity of the anterior septal deformity. Postoperative smaller MCA found in the opposite side of that narrowed by a severe anterior septal deformity may be explained by the impact of septoplasty without reduction of a hypertrophic turbinate. A highly significant relation between MCA and the subjective feeling of nasal patency, before and after surgery, suggests that MCA is a valuable parameter to express nasal patency. Correction of posterior septal deformities is found to increase significantly the cross-sectional area posteriorly. The effect of decongestion in the postoperative values, however, suggests that the mucosa contributes even more to the cross-sectional area of the posterior part of the nose. Acoustic rhinometry seems very suitable for evaluation of the nasal cavity in cases where septoplasty and turbinoplasty is considered, as well as for the postoperative evaluation.\r"

The photobiological effects resulting from exposure of cells to 308 nm and 248 nm radiation appear to be the same as those obtained using low irradiance CW sources at similar wavelengths. This indicates that the high irradiances available from the excimer laser cause the same DNA photochemistry as the lower-irradiance CW sources. Excimer laser radiation at 193 nm causes less cytotoxicity than predicted based on the DNA absorption spectrum. This may result from absorption of 193 nm radiation by protein present between the cell surface, and nuclear DNA, or from less efficient DNA photochemistry using 193 nm radiation. In vitro assays indicate that DNA-damaging effects resulting in cytotoxicity decrease in the order 248 nm greater than 308 nm greater than 193 nm.\r"

  ".W": "It is uncertain what is the most appropriate medical therapy for patients with severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. Therefore, we carried out a single-blind, randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of prednisone with that of cyclosporine in 36 patients who had been euthyroid for at least two months. The two groups, each consisting of 18 patients, were similar in age, sex, and the duration and severity of ophthalmopathy. The initial dose of cyclosporine was 7.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, and that of prednisone was 60 mg per day, which was subsequently tapered to 20 mg per day. During the 12-week treatment period, 11 prednisone-treated and 4 cyclosporine-treated patients responded to therapy (61 percent vs. 22 percent; P = 0.018); response was manifested by decreases in eye-muscle enlargement and proptosis and improved visual acuity and total and subjective eye scores. There were no differences at base line between the patients who later responded and those who did not. Prednisone was tolerated less well than cyclosporine. After 12 weeks, patients who did not respond were treated for another 12 weeks with a combination of cyclosporine and a low dose of prednisone. Among the 9 patients who initially received prednisone, the addition of cyclosporine resulted in improvement in 5 (56 percent); among the 13 patients who received cyclosporine initially, 8 (62 percent) improved after the addition of prednisone. Combination therapy was better tolerated than prednisone treatment alone. We conclude that single-drug therapy with prednisone is more effective than cyclosporine in patients with severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. The combination can be effective in patients who do not respond to either drug alone.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we determined the level of fetal hemoglobin in dead and living infants in three different laboratories by three methods: high-performance liquid chromatography, polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and cell-based immunofluorescence assays for fetal hemoglobin-containing red cells (F cells). Our infant study population consisted of 67 infants who had died of SIDS, 22 control infants examined at autopsy, and 80 living infants. The fetal hemoglobin level was not higher in the infants who had died of SIDS than in the control infants for any age group analyzed. Immunofluorescence assays for F cells were also performed in blood samples from 105 mothers of infants who had died of SIDS, 55 adult female controls, 52 fathers of infants who had died of SIDS, and 67 adult male controls. The percentage of fetal hemoglobin-containing red cells in the parents of infants who had died of SIDS was not statistically different from that in sex-matched adults in the control groups. We conclude that elevated fetal hemoglobin levels in infants or their parents are not suitable for use as indicators of the risk of SIDS in the infants. Furthermore, the fetal hemoglobin level is not useful as a postmortem marker of an infant's having died of SIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease may be adversely affected by the presence of carboxyhemoglobin, even at low concentrations. We investigated the effects of carbon monoxide exposure on myocardial ischemia during exercise in 63 men with documented coronary artery disease. On each test day, subjects performed two symptom-limited incremental exercise tests on a treadmill; the tests were separated by a recovery period and 50 to 70 minutes of exposure to either room air or air containing one of two concentrations of carbon monoxide (117 +/- 4.4 ppm or 253 +/- 6.1 ppm). The order of exposure was assigned randomly. On each occasion, neither the subjects nor the study personnel knew whether the subjects had been exposed to room air or to one of the concentrations of carbon monoxide. Exposure to room air resulted in a mean carboxyhemoglobin level of 0.6 percent, exposure to the lower level of carbon monoxide resulted in a carboxyhemoglobin level of 2.0 percent, and exposure to the higher level of carbon monoxide resulted in a level of 3.9 percent. An effect of carbon monoxide on myocardial ischemia was demonstrated objectively by electrocardiographic changes during exercise. We observed a decrease of 5.1 percent (90 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 8.7 percent; P = 0.02) and a decrease of 12.1 percent (90 percent confidence interval, 9.0 to 15.3 percent; P less than or equal to 0.0001) in the length of time to a threshold ischemic ST-segment change (ST end point) after carbon monoxide exposures that produced carboxyhemoglobin levels of 2.0 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively. The length of time to the onset of angina decreased by 4.2 percent (90 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 7.9 percent; P = 0.054) at the 2.0 percent carboxyhemoglobin level and by 7.1 percent (90 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 10.9 percent; P = 0.004) at the 3.9 percent carboxyhemoglobin level. Significant dose-response relations were found in both the change in the length of time to the ST end point (P less than or equal to 0.0001) and the change in the length of time to the onset of angina (P = 0.02). We conclude that low levels of carboxyhemoglobin exacerbate myocardial ischemia during graded exercise in subjects with coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that desmopressin may reduce the bleeding diathesis that often complicates open-heart surgery. To pursue this question further, we performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether the previously reported beneficial effect of desmopressin on hemostasis during complex cardiac surgery was applicable to all elective cardiac surgical procedures involving cardiopulmonary bypass. In 150 consecutive patients, most of whom underwent primary coronary-artery bypass grafting, we compared the effects of intravenous desmopressin (0.3 microgram per kilogram of body weight) with those of saline placebo on postoperative blood loss and the need to replace blood products. The median amount of blood lost within the first 24 hours after operation was similar in the desmopressin and placebo groups (865 vs. 738 ml; P = 0.26). The postoperative use of blood replacement products did not differ significantly between the groups (1025 ml [95 percent confidence interval, 300 to 4140 ml] in the desmopressin group and 860 ml [247 to 5346 ml] in the placebo group). Desmopressin is believed to exert its hemostatic effect by releasing von Willebrand factor. The level of ristocetin cofactor, a functional index of the level of von Willebrand factor, was increased approximately twofold from base line in both treatment groups 90 minutes and 24 hours after the administration of medication. Similarly, the levels of von Willebrand factor multimers increased uniformly in both groups. These findings may be consistent with a normal stress response of von Willebrand factor to major surgery and could explain our failure to detect a therapeutic effect of desmopressin. We conclude that the majority of patients who undergo elective cardiac surgery receive no hemostatic benefit from the use of desmopressin.\r"

The first phase of clinical trials suggests that they may augment hematopoiesis in a number of different conditions of primary and secondary bone marrow dysfunction. Future clinical use is likely to include combinations of these growth factors, in order to stimulate early marrow progenitors and obtain multilineage effects. An improved understanding of the biologic and clinical effects of hematopoietic growth factors promises future clinical applications for conditions of impaired function and reduced numbers of blood cells.\r"

  ".U": "90044043\r", 
  ".W": "Many cellular functions are regulated by activation of cell-surface receptors that mobilize calcium from internal stores sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). The nature of these internal calcium stores and their localization in cells is not clear and has been a subject of debate. It was originally suggested that the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store is the endoplasmic reticulum, but a new organelle, the calciosome, identified by its possession of the calcium-binding protein, calsequestrin, and a Ca2+-ATPase-like protein of relative molecular mass 100,000 (100K), has been described as a potential Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive calcium store. Direct evidence on whether the calciosome is the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store is lacking. Using monoclonal antibodies raised against the Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, we show that bovine adrenal chromaffin cells contain two Ca2+-ATPase-like proteins with distinct subcellular distributions. A 100K Ca2+-ATPase-like protein is diffusely distributed, whereas a 140K Ca2+-ATPase-like protein is restricted to a region in close proximity to the nucleus. In addition, Ins(1,4,5)P3-generating agonists result in a highly localized rise in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) initiated in a region close to the nucleus, whereas caffeine results in a rise in [Ca2+]i throughout the cytoplasm. Our results indicate that chromaffin cells possess two calcium stores with distinct Ca2+-ATPases and that the organelle with the 100K Ca2+-ATPase is not the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store.\r"

To prove that these cellular proteins function in chromosomal DNA replication we have begun to identify homologous proteins in an organism that can be genetically manipulated. Here we report the identification of yeast replication factor-A (yRF-A) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and show that it is functionally and structurally related to a human protein that is required for the initiation and elongation of SV40 DNA replication. Yeast RF-A, a multi-subunit phosphoprotein, is similar to the human protein in its chromatographic behaviour, subunit structure and DNA-binding activity. The yeast protein will fully substitute for the human protein in an early stage of the initiation of SV40 DNA replication. Substitution of yRF-A in the complete SV40 replication system, however, results in reduced DNA replication, presumably due to a requirement for species-specific interactions between yeast RF-A and the DNA polymerase complex.\r"

  ".W": "Nucleotide excision repair helps to ameliorate the lethal and mutagenic consequences of DNA damage by removing helix-distorting lesions from cellular genomes. We have previously analysed the removal of ultraviolet-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from specific DNA sequences in mammalian cells and demonstrated that transcriptionally active genes are preferentially repaired. Additionally, we found that in rodent and human cells only the transcribed strand of the dihydrofolate reductase gene is selectively repaired. Transcription is blocked by pyrimidine dimers in template DNA and the selective removal of these lesions seems to be important for cell survival after irradiation with ultraviolet light. To determine whether this feature of repair is common to prokaryotes and eukaryotes and better to understand its mechanism, we have investigated repair in the two separate DNA strands of the lactose operon of ultraviolet-irradiated Escherichia coli. We find a dramatic difference in the repair of the two strands only when transcription is induced. Most dimers are removed from the transcribed strand of the induced operon within five minutes of irradiation. In the nontranscribed strand, repair is significantly slower and resembles that found in both strands of the uninduced operon. Thus there seems to be a mechanism that couples nucleotide excision repair and transcription.\r"

A cerebellar Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor has been characterized biochemically and shown by immunocytochemistry to be present in intracellular membranes in Purkinje cells. We show that a previously described Purkinje-cell messenger RNA encodes a protein of relative molecular mass 260,000 (260 K) with the same properties as the cerebellar Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. Its sequence is partially homologous to the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor. By immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy the protein is shown to be present in all parts of the endoplasmic reticulum, including those that extend into axon terminals and dendritic spines. Our results indicate that gated calcium release from intracellular stores in muscle and Purkinje cells uses similar calcium-channel proteins localized in analogous intracellular compartments. This implies that the intracellular calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons extend into presynaptic terminals and dendritic spines where they may play a direct role in regulating the efficacy of neurotransmission.\r"

  ".W": "Knowledge of the tertiary structure of the proteinase from human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 is important to the design of inhibitors that might possess antiviral activity and thus be useful in the treatment of AIDS. The conserved Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly sequence in retroviral proteinases suggests that they exist as dimers similar to the ancestor proposed for the pepsins. Although this has been confirmed by X-ray analyses of Rous sarcoma virus and HIV-1 proteinases, these structures have overall folds that are similar to each other only where they are also similar to the pepsins. We now report a further X-ray analysis of a recombinant HIV-1 proteinase at 2.7 A resolution. The polypeptide chain adopts a fold in which the N- and C-terminal strands are organized together in a four-stranded beta-sheet. A helix precedes the single C-terminal strand, as in the Rous sarcoma virus proteinase and also in a synthetic HIV-1 proteinase, in which the cysteines have been replaced by alpha-aminobuytric acid. The structure reported here provides an explanation for the amino acid invariance amongst retroviral proteinases, but differs from that reported earlier in some residues that are candidates for substrate interactions at P3, and in the mode of intramolecular cleavage during processing of the polyprotein.\r"

In a double-blind crossover study of patients who were on chronic oleic acid (C18:1) therapy, addition of erucic acid to the diet led to a further reduction in plasma hexacosanoic acid (C26:0) concentration. We treated 12 newly diagnosed ALD patients with a diet enriched with erucic acid and oleic acid for 2 to 19 months. Mean plasma C26:0 concentration decreased to normal by 4 weeks, and the C26:0 composition of plasma sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine became normal by 4 months on therapy. Fatty acid analysis of postmortem tissues from 1 boy treated for 10 months suggested that dietary erucic acid entered the heart, liver, adrenal gland, and brain. Eight patients remained on treatment long enough (mean, 12 +/- 3 months) to evaluate their clinical response; 6 of these patients with moderate to advanced disease deteriorated neurologically or showed progression of white matter disease on brain magnetic resonance imaging whereas 2 mildly affected patients remained clinically stable after 10 and 19 months. No adverse effects of the diet occurred. We conclude that dietary erucic acid therapy is effective in lowering plasma C26:0 to normal in ALD patients, and may prevent further demyelination in some mildly affected boys.\r"

In addition, since the age of 13, the younger brother has had epilepsy and has been treated with phenytoin combined with other antiepileptic drugs. Analysis of the DNA from each of the 2 brothers revealed a similar deletion at the 5' end of the dystrophin gene. The different clinical courses despite the similar mutational event suggest that intrinsic muscle factors due to modified genes or environmental phenomena such as prolonged treatment with phenytoin or other antiepileptic agents may have influenced the clinical course.\r"

Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) can detect the arterial narrowing noninvasively, but the sensitivity and specificity of this technique have not been reported in a population of patients with a high frequency of angiographic vasospasm. In this study, 34 consecutive patients with SAH undergoing angiography during the period of risk for vasospasm had technically adequate TCD examinations within 24 hours of the angiogram. Using a mean flow velocity of 120 cm/sec and above as indicative of vasospasm, TCD correctly detected angiographic vasospasm in 17 patients; there were no false positives. It correctly determined that 5 patients did not have vasospasm, whereas there were 12 false negatives. False negatives were frequently due to angiographic vasospasm involving vessels not assessable by TCD. The correlation between mean flow velocity and the angiographic residual lumen diameter of the middle cerebral artery was statistically significant. These data suggest that TCD is a highly specific (100%), but less sensitive (58.6%) test for the detection of angiographic vasospasm following SAH. Confirmatory angiography may be avoided if the TCD study is positive, but additional studies may be necessary if the clinical picture is suspicious and the TCD study is negative.\r"

Madison Taylor, working for S. Weir Mitchell at the Philadelphia Orthopedic Hospital, designed the first such \"reflex hammer.\" Taylor's hammer had a triangular rubber head and a short, flattened metal handle. Krauss (1894), Berliner (1910), Troemner (1910), Babinski (1912), and Wintle (1925) also designed popular reflex hammers. Many of these hammers and several others are still in use.\r"

  ".W": "The application of correction factors for maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) is expected to increase the accuracy of this screening tool. Correction for maternal weight compensates for the dilution effect of a larger plasma volume in women of greater weight. We analyzed the effect of a previously published linear correction formula for weight on the frequency of abnormal MSAFP results. Serum samples from 8276 patients were studied for AFP and were grouped according to maternal weight in 50-lb increments. Abnormal results were defined as 0.4 or less or 2.5 or more multiples of the median for gestational age. Without correction, the highest rate (15%) of low MSAFP results was obtained in the obese population. Conversely, the rate of elevated MSAFP was highest (3.8%) in the lowest maternal weight group. Correction for weight up to 250 lb significantly increased the rate of abnormally high results in the obese group, indicating an overcorrection effect. The number of amniocenteses indicated for abnormal MSAFP was reduced by about 9% with weight correction. We suggest that linear correction of serum AFP results is adequate for maternal weights up to 200 lb. Results in women weighing more than this upper limit should be corrected as if the weight were 200 lb only. This balances the frequency of abnormal results in all weight groups and maintains the reduction in number of procedures performed.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to compare our experience with meperidine given intravenously by the patient versus by a nurse. Sixty-four healthy women beginning active labor (cervical dilation 3 cm) at term were randomly assigned to either self-administer a 10-mg dose as often as every 20 minutes or have a nurse administer 25-50 mg every 3 hours as requested. The total meperidine dose and consumption rates were greater when administered by the patient than by a nurse. Maternal side effects occurred with similar frequency in both groups, and pain relief was judged to be equivalent. Maternal and umbilical serum concentrations of meperidine at delivery increased in the patient-controlled group if active labor lasted longer than 2 hours. Neonatal naloxone therapy was used more often when meperidine was administered by the patient than by a nurse (five of 31, 16%, versus three of 33, 10%, respectively). Self-administration of intravenous meperidine by the laboring patient was not found to be advantageous over nursing administration, and may pose an increased threat to the infant.\r"

Second-trimester biparietal diameter (BPD)/femur length and observed-to-expected femur length ratios were examined in 48 chromosomally abnormal fetuses and compared with those of a control population composed of both low-risk patients (maternal age less than 35 years) and high-risk patients (maternal age 35 years or more). Biparietal diameter/femur length ratio correctly identified 18% of Down syndrome pregnancies with a positive predictive value of one in 169 and a false-positive rate of only 4%. When trisomies 21, 18, and 13 were considered collectively, a sensitivity of 29% and a predictive value of one in 78 were achieved, with no increase in the false-positive rate (4%). Observed-to-expected femur length ratio was less valuable in detecting chromosomally abnormal fetuses. These data suggest that the BPD/femur length ratio holds promise as a screening tool for the antenatal detection of fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Although encouraging, extrapolation of these results to other centers is not recommended without independent verification.\r"

Furthermore, neither the sensitivities nor the positive predictive values were above 50% in any of the gestational-age intervals individually studied. We conclude that Doppler study of umbilical artery flow velocities is not of much value in the prediction of SGA infants in twin pregnancies, although persistently absent end-diastolic velocities were associated with poor outcome.\r"

Biopsy specimens from the levator ani muscles during vaginal hysterectomy and repair were evaluated for the number and the individual diameters of type I (slow-twitch) and type II (fast twitch) fibers. Biopsies from 11 women revealed striated muscle tissue, whereas no muscle tissue was observed in the other 19. Compared with patients without muscle tissue, subjects with positive muscle findings showed significantly higher transmission ratios (55.0 +/- 23.4 versus 32.9 +/- 22.1%; P less than .05). Mean diameter and counts of types I and II muscle fibers decreased significantly with age (P less than .05). Urethral closure pressure during stress significantly increased with mean diameter of type II muscle fibers (P less than .05). In contrast to patients with severely damaged pelvic floor muscles, the presence of slow-twitch fibers is associated with improved support of the pelvic viscera, especially under conditions leading to intra-abdominal pressure rise. The presence of fast-twitch fibers improves the periurethral continence mechanism, resulting in an increase of urethral closure pressure during stress.\r"

At family planning clinics, prenatal clinics, and in delivery room settings (cord blood testing), studies that have not targeted women at high risk for HIV infection have shown prevalence rates ranging from 0-4.3%. Higher rates (greater than 1%) have been observed in more urban areas--Newark, New York City, Baltimore, Miami, and San Juan; rates at settings outside these areas have generally been below 1%. Filter-paper testing for maternal HIV antibodies from neonatal heel-stick specimens has been conducted statewide in Massachusetts and New York; prevalence rates were 0.3% in Massachusetts in 1987, and 0.2% in upstate New York and 1.3% in New York City in 1987-1988. Prevalence rates of female military applicants and female blood donors are below 0.03% and 0.1%, respectively, and have been relatively stable over time. Where age data are available, prevalence rates are near 0 in women below age 20 years, are higher for young adult and early middle-aged women, and decline thereafter. Studies have also been conducted using blood samples from women undergoing premarital testing for syphilis serology, from women attending sexually transmitted disease clinics and drug treatment centers, and from patients at sentinel hospital sites. Information on the prevalence of HIV infection in United States women is useful to identify specific populations at risk for HIV infection and to target and evaluate education and prevention efforts.\r"

  ".W": "The use of endosonographic methods (transvaginal sonography, transrectal sonography, cystosonography, hysterosonography) is increasing for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in obstetrics and gynecology. Because different means of description lead to confusion, endosonography needs a defined method of orientation. The topography used for transabdominal sonography should also be employed for endosonography. When performing transabdominal sonography, the scanner surface is always projected to the top of the screen, regardless of whether the patient is investigated from a ventral or dorsal position. With endosonography, the contact surface of all linear arrays, curved arrays, and sector scanners should be projected to the bottom of the screen. Using a frontally radiating sector scanner or curved array for a sagittal section, the left side of the screen should correspond with dorsal and the right side with ventral; for all other sections, left and right must be defined. A standardized way of displaying images obtained by endosonography should project the scanner surface to the bottom of the image and can be used on all available technical equipment without major difficulty. The advantage of displaying endosonographic images in this standardized manner is the simple differentiation of pictures obtained by an endosonographic or transabdominal technique.\r"

The strain of F. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). P. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. It is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes.

The tissues and organs affected by deposits of AB2M appear to differ from those affected by the other major types of amyloidosis; AB2M affects mainly the carpal ligament, synovia of large joints, juxtaarticular bone, and intervetebral disks, while involvement of the oral tissues has been rare. We present here a case in which the biopsy of superficial lingual deposits of AB2M led to the recognition that the patient had developed hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis.

Lack of efficiency could be due to incomplete denervation of the plexus; however, a method for measuring the completeness of celiac plexus blockade is not yet available. We have, therefore, monitored the physiological completeness of pharmacological percutaneous celiac blockade with 40 ml 25% ethanol by measuring the effect of posture on heart rate, blood pressure, hepato-splanchnic vascular resistance, and pancreatic hormone concentrations before and after celiac plexus block in 6 patients with chronic pancreatitis. Blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased after the block (P less than 0.025), whereas no significant change was found in hepato-splanchnic vascular resistance nor in the change of these parameters during transition from the supine to standing position. Pancreatic hormones (C-peptide, free insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide and somatostatin) did not change in response to standing, either before or after the block. The cardiovascular variables were normalized the day after the block, and all the patients were in their habitual state regarding pain after 1 week. In conclusion, pancreatic hormone concentrations in response to standing are not useful for monitoring celiac plexus block, whereas heart rate, blood pressure and hepato-splanchnic blood flow may yield useful information. From such measurements it was concluded that permanent denervation of the celiac plexus was not achieved in our patients after injection of 40 ml 25% ethanol.\r"

  ".W": "Substance P (SP) has been proposed as a mediator of nociception in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Activation of nociceptive pathways by stimuli such as formalin injected into the hind paw has been shown to produce an increase in the amount of immunoreactive SP in primary afferent neurons. Opiate agonist and antagonist binding in the dorsal horn has been shown to affect the SP levels and release. In order to determine the effects of opiates on SP mediated nociception in the spinal cord, anesthetized rats pretreated subcutaneously with morphine, naloxone, or saline were injected in the right hind paw with 0.4 ml of either saline of 5% formalin. After 1 h, the animals were perfused and the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord removed. SP-like immunoreactivity (SPLI) in the dorsal horns was quantitated using immunohistochemical staining and manual photometry. The results show that formalin injection increases the SPLI in the dorsal horn after 1 h, as does pretreatment with morphine. Morphine pretreatment combined with formalin injection further increases SPLI, but not significantly higher than either treatment alone. The morphine-induced increases could be blocked by naloxone, which had no effects on saline-treated controls. Most importantly, naloxone was able to block the formalin-induced increase in SPLI, implying that endogenous opioid systems play a role in the SP increases seen during formalin-induced nociception.\r"

The present investigation tested the hypothesis that pain in chronic headache is the result of insufficiently attenuated nociceptive impulses. Forty-seven patients suffering from chronic tension headache entered the present double-blind cross-over trial of naloxone 4 mg i.v. versus saline. Adverse effects were negligible. Patients scored headache pain on a 100 mm visual analog scale and change in headache on a 5-point verbal rating scale after 5, 15, 30, 60 and 90 min. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased 4.2 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) after naloxone compared to saline, but naloxone had no effect on headache (P = 0.96). A bimodal distribution of acute pain patients into placebo responders and non-responders has been reported, but our chronic pain patients showed a homogeneous placebo response. Review of the literature indicates that acute clinical pain and stimulation-induced analgesia in experimental pain has a naloxone-responsive component. Chronic pain does not appear to be influenced by naloxone in moderate doses.\r"

  ".W": "Although adequate assessment of pain and anxiety during burn wound care serves important clinical and scientific goals (e.g., determination of medication dosage and evaluation of treatment effects), few data are actually available. Studies which compare self-reported pain with observational ratings frequently suffer from small sample sizes or questionable data analysis techniques. This paper presents a study in which 126 burn wound dressing changes were independently rated by patient and nurse(s). Variables investigated were overall pain, worst pain, overall tension and tension just before the procedure. Also studied were the effects of age, extent of burn damage, medication use and nurses' experience with burn patients. It is concluded that although there are significant relationships between patients' and nurses' ratings, these relationships are not very strong. In contrast to self-reports, observational ratings seem to be affected by patient's age. Patients' ratings of tension correlate with the amount of analgesic medication used. It is argued that it is not useful to discuss the present and earlier studies only in terms of correctness or incorrectness of observational ratings. Recommendations for future studies include the study of pain-related behaviors, coping mechanisms and effects of treatments. Considering the vast differences in prescription regimes among centers, a multicenter trial would be particularly interesting.\r"

We conducted a placebo-controlled randomized trial giving oral rhesus rotavirus vaccine (RRV) (strain MMU 18006) alone and together with a child's first dose of OPV and diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-pertussis to examine the possible interaction of these vaccines. A total of 102 infants 2 to 3 months of age were randomized into 3 groups to receive (1) RRV with OPV, (2) placebo with OPV and (3) RRV 2 weeks after OPV. All infants were given diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-pertussis. Serum samples were collected at the time of OPV immunization and 3 to 5 weeks later. Three to 5 weeks after OPV immunization 60% of infants had a 4-fold rise in neutralization titer to at least one of the three poliovirus serotypes. The rate of antibody response to poliovirus did not differ by RRV groups but a lower rate was correlated with a shorter interval (3 vs. 5 weeks) between OPV vaccination and antibody measurement. Fifty-six percent of infants had a 4-fold rise of IgA and 62% had a 4-fold rise of neutralizing antibody to RRV; this rise did not differ according to time of OPV immunization. RRV was not associated with side effects and may be safely given with OPV to infants 2 to 3 months of age.\r"

Aztreonam, the first of these monobactams, has been studied extensively in order to determine its pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic profile in adults and children with bacterial infections. It has been established, for example, that with intramuscular or intravenous dosing (30 to 50 mg/kg in children and 1 to 2 g in adults), serum concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentrations of most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria can be maintained for up to 8 hours. Against a less susceptible pathogen such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, every-6-hour dosing allows for preservation of the bactericidal effect, although longer intervals may be practical in low birth weight infants. The drug is primarily (80%) excreted by renal mechanisms and serum clearance varies with postnatal age. Distribution into body fluids is similar to that of other beta-lactams. For example in the presence of meningeal inflammation, cerebrospinal fluid concentrations are 17 to 33% of serum values. Urinary concentrations are high and prolonged with greater than 80% appearing as the active drug. Preliminary data from cystic fibrosis patients suggest that there are very minor pharmacokinetic differences in this population. The pharmacologic profile indicates that aztreonam may provide an appropriate alternative to traditional therapy for serious Gram-negative aerobic infections in infants and children.\r"

  ".W": "Aztreonam, the first of the new class of monobactams, has a narrow and specific range of bactericidal activity; it is highly active against Gram-negative aerobic pathogens but is essentially inactive against Gram-positive or anaerobic bacteria. Several unique features indicate that aztreonam may provide an attractive choice for the treatment of serious Gram-negative infection in adults and children. Clinical study in adults has shown aztreonam to be highly effective against infections of the urinary and lower respiratory tracts, the musculoskeletal system and the female genitourinary tract. It also has proved useful in neutropenic patients, including those with cancer, and for treatment of bacterial peritonitis, gonorrhea, cellulitis and wound infections. Reported clinical and microbiologic cure rates have been comparable to those associated with traditional therapeutic approaches (85 to 100%). In the treatment of children with urinary tract infection as well as other types of infections, aztreonam therapy in a dosage of 30 mg/kg given every 6 to 8 hours was associated with satisfactory clinical and microbiologic cure rates. There appear to be specific clinical situations for which aztreonam may be an appropriate alternative to more toxic therapies, although comparative trials are needed to delineate the exact place of aztreonam in the armamentarium against bacterial infection.\r"

Most urinary tract infections are uncomplicated and respond readily to treatment. However, complications may make treatment difficult and result in serious adverse sequelae. Several characteristics of aztreonam make it an attractive alternative to aminoglycosides and certain other antibiotics for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections in children. It has been shown, for example, that the drug is highly active against most of the pathogenic organisms responsible for urinary tract infections in the pediatric population, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and many less common, aminoglycoside- and cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Aztreonam is widely distributed throughout the body and achieves potentially therapeutic concentrations in the kidneys and in urine for up to 24 hours after dosing. The efficacy and safety of this agent compare favorably with standard antibiotic agents. Aztreonam is associated with high rates of microbiologic and clinical cures, and the few side effects reported have been mild and transient.\r"

Many antimicrobial agents have proved incompletely effective against this persistent pathogen, and even the aminoglycosides, which represent the traditional therapy for such infections, have been associated with considerable toxicity and resistance. The monobactam antibacterial agent aztreonam is used both as single-agent therapy and in combination with other drugs. Several controlled, clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of CF patients with pulmonary exacerbations caused by P. aeruginosa. The only side effect of aztreonam therapy commonly encountered in these studies was elevation of hepatic transaminase concentrations; this effect was of uncertain significance. It was concluded that aztreonam may offer clinical efficacy comparable to that provided by the combination of tobramycin plus azlocillin. Further, there does not seem to be any appreciable difference in the development of resistance to aztreonam compared with traditional therapies.\r"

Extensive toxicity and safety data for aztreonam in animals, healthy volunteers and adult patients have been accumulated previously; recently these studies have been extended to children. Overall the incidence of adverse clinical reactions caused by aztreonam is similar to or lower than that caused by comparison drugs. There is no evidence that aztreonam causes significant ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity; biochemical and hematologic abnormalities are rarely significant. Compared with the broad spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam causes less disruption of normal gastrointestinal flora and consequently a lower incidence of diarrhea. Aztreonam does not displace bilirubin from albumin and penetrates readily into cerebrospinal fluid. Because of negligible immunologic cross-reactivity with other beta-lactams, aztreonam has been safely administered to patients with IgE-mediated penicillin hypersensitivity. These data suggest that aztreonam should be safe and well-tolerated in infants and children with infections caused by susceptible Gram-negative bacteria.\r"

Thymine glycol was positioned at a unique site in the single-stranded genome of a bacteriophage M13mp19 derivative. Replication of the genome in E. coli yielded targeted mutations at a frequency of 0.3%; the mutations were exclusively T----C. Mutagenesis was independent of SOS and nth (nth encodes endonuclease III, a thymine glycol repair enzyme). The adduct was not detectably mutagenic in duplex DNA. A chemical rationalization for the mutation observed for thymine glycol was developed by applying molecular modeling and molecular mechanical calculations to the same DNA sequence studied in vivo. Modeling suggested that the 5R,6S isomer of cis-thymine glycol, when not base paired, was displaced laterally by approximately 0.5 A toward the major groove in comparison to the position that thymine would otherwise occupy. This perturbation of DNA structure should increase the likelihood of a guanine.thymine glycol wobble base pair during replication, which would explain the mutational specificity of the base observed in the genetic experiments.\r"

On the contrary, the amount of HU1 present in hupA mutant strains corresponds to only 6% of the total HU present in wild-type cells. We showed by fusions of the hupB and hupA promoters to the malPQ operon that the absence of one subunit has no major effect on the transcription rate of the gene encoding the other subunit. Analysis of the stability of the HU1 and HU2 subunits, using pulse-chase labeling experiments, showed that the HU1 subunit is degraded specifically in the absence of the HU2 subunit and, moreover, that this degradation is dependent on the presence of the Lon protease.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphomas of certain strains of chickens infected by retroviruses frequently contain recombinant transforming genes in which the promoter of the cellular proto-myc gene is replaced by that of a defective rather than an intact retrovirus. Here we ask whether the resulting hybrid genes are sufficient for tumorigenic transformation like viral myc genes. Further, we ask whether retroviruses must be defective in order to mutate proto-myc to a transforming gene or whether the defectiveness plays a transformation-independent function in tumorigenesis. For this purpose the defective provirus of proviral-proto-myc recombinants from lymphomas were repaired, or intact proviruses were recombined with proto-myc genes in vitro, and then compared to recombinant proto-myc genes with defective proviruses for transforming function in quail embryo fibroblasts. It was found that a single copy of a provirus-proto-myc recombinant gene with an intact provirus is sufficient to transform a quail embryo cell in vitro. Moreover, our analyses showed that multiple internal retroviral deletions [corrected] eliminate or inhibit provirus expression. The effect of these deletions [corrected] was detectable only because the inactive proviruses were linked to the selectable, transforming proto-myc gene marker. It is consistent with our results that proviral defectiveness of recombinant proto-myc genes is necessary in vivo for the clonal growth of a transformed cell into a tumor to escape antiviral immunity. The large discrepancy between the probabilities of provirus insertion and tumorigenesis is suggested to reflect the low probabilities of spontaneous deletion of the provirus and of rare, strain-specific defects of tumor-resistance genes of the host.\r"

The recombinant virus was used to infect insect cells, which resulted in the abundant expression of CD4 as evaluated by flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis. Recombinant CD4 expressed on the surface of infected insect cells was immunologically indistinguishable from human CD4 when using 11 different anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies. The extraction of infected cells by phase-transition separation with Triton X-114 followed by immunoaffinity chromatography yielded a single protein detected by NaDodSO4/PAGE using silver staining. N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified recombinant protein showed that CD4 produced in Sf9 cells is efficiently cleaved from the precursor protein. Immunoblot analysis under nondenaturing conditions showed that the purified protein reacted with the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody Leu-3a.

  ".W": "Rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) is a member of a family of cytoplasmic hydrophobic ligand-binding proteins. To gain insights about the contribution of bound fatty acid to I-FABP's conformation and mechanism of ligand binding, we have determined the structure of Escherichia coli-derived rat apo-I-FABP to 1.96-A resolution and compared it to the recently refined structure of I-FABP with bound palmitate. Both apo- and holo-I-FABP are composed primarily of anti-parallel beta-strands which form two nearly orthogonal beta-sheets (\"beta-clam\"). The overall structures of the apo- and holo-I-FABP are nearly identical, with a root mean square (rms) difference of 0.37 A between C alpha atoms, 0.38 A between all main-chain atoms, and 0.94 A between all side-chain atoms. However, rms differences of greater than 1.3 A were noted for the side chains of Ile-23, Lys-27, Arg-56, Leu-72, Ala-73, and Asp-74. The space occupied by bound ligand in the core of the holoprotein is occupied in the apo-protein by ordered solvent molecules. This results in an increase in the total number of internal ordered solvent molecules from 7 in the holoprotein to 13 in apo-I-FABP. This finding, together with observed differences in the side-chain orientations of two residues (Arg-56 and Lys-27) situated over a potential opening to the cores of the apo- and holoproteins, suggests that solvent molecules play a critical role in ligand binding. Moreover, the data indicate that the beta-clam structure is stable even in the absence of bound ligand.\r"

  ".U": "90046672\r", 
  ".W": "This work demonstrates that phototaxis stimuli in the archaebacterium Halobacterium halobium control a methylation/demethylation system in vivo through photoactivation of sensory rhodopsin I (SR-I) in either its attractant or repellent signaling form as well as through the repellent receptor sensory rhodopsin II (SR-II, also called phoborhodopsin). The effects of positive stimuli that suppress swimming reversals (i.e., an increase in attractant or decrease in repellent light) and negative stimuli that induce swimming reversals (i.e., a decrease in attractant or increase in repellent light) through each photoreceptor were monitored by assaying release of volatile [3H]methyl groups. This assay has been used to measure [3H]methanol produced during the process of adaptation to chemotactic stimuli in eubacteria. In H. halobium positive photostimuli produce a transient increase in the rate of demethylation followed by a decrease below the unstimulated value, whereas negative photostimuli cause an increase followed by a rate similar to that of the unstimulated value. Photoactivation of the SR-I attractant and simultaneous photoactivation of the SR-II repellent receptors cancel in their effects on demethylation, demonstrating the methylation system is regulated by an integrated signal. Analysis of mutants indicates that the source for the volatile methyl groups is intrinsic membrane proteins distinct from the chromoproteins that share the membrane. A methyl-accepting protein (94 kDa) previously correlated in amount with the SR-I chromoprotein (25 kDa) is shown here to be missing in a recently isolated SR-I-SR-II+ mutant (Flx3b), thus confirming the association of this protein with SR-I. Photoactivated SR-II in mutant Flx3b controls demethylation, predicting the existence of a photomodulated methyl-accepting component distinct from the 94-kDa protein of SR-I. We present a model in which the three known phototaxis signaling receptor states (the attractant receptor SR-I587, its repellent form S373, and the repellent receptor SR-II490) are coupled to two distinct transducers the demethylation of which is controlled by one integrated signal.\r"

Comparison of the subunit compositions of purified 20S and 26S complexes indicates that the former is an integral part of the latter. By the use of detergent treatment to activate latent protease activity, we show that the 20S protease becomes incorporated into the 26S complex in the ATP-dependent assembly process. It thus seems that the 20S protease is the \"catalytic core\" of the 26S complex of the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway.\r"

This protein comigrated in SDS/PAGE with a native high molecular weight glutenin subunit extracted from wheat endosperm and cross-reacted with antibodies raised against purified wheat high molecular weight glutenins. The wheat subunit synthesized in E. coli also exhibited pI and solubility characteristics identical to those of native wheat subunits. Moreover, the wheat glutenin subunit produced in E. coli cells self-assembled into oligomers linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds, a process that plays an important role in the assembly of native glutenins during gluten formation. The large amounts of a purified wheat subunit obtained from E. coli will enable investigators to analyze the three-dimensional structure of that protein and to identify protein sequences that affect the bread-making quality of wheat dough.\r"

In contrast, the acutely insulin-regulatable glucose transporter (IRGT) is expressed only in the adipocytes. In the present study, the expression of the IRGT was shown to increase in parallel with the acquisition of acutely insulin-stimulated glucose uptake during differentiation of these cells, whereas the level of the HepG2-GT decreased during the course of differentiation in parallel with a decline in basal glucose uptake. We examined the effects of chronic insulin and tolbutamide treatment on glucose transporter activity in conjunction with the expression of these two glucose transporter species in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment of adipocytes with insulin, tolbutamide, or both agents in combination increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake, HepG2-GT protein, and HepG2-GT mRNA levels in parallel. The effect of combined insulin/tolbutamide administration on these three parameters was greater than the effect of either treatment alone. In contrast, these treatments either had no significant effect or decreased levels of IRGT protein and mRNA. We conclude that chronic treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin or tolbutamide increases glucose uptake primarily by means of a selective increase in the expression of the HepG2-GT. We suggest that part of the in vivo hypoglycemic effect of insulin and sulfonylureas may involve an increased expression of the HepG2-GT.\r"

The role of a carboxyl-terminal variant of alpha-type c-erbA (c-erbA alpha-2) is controversial, since the human form has been reported to be a T3 receptor, while the rat form has been shown to not bind T3. In fact, the rat homolog of c-erbA alpha-2 has been reported to be an inhibitor of T3 action. We have compared the properties of human c-erbA alpha-2 with those of its rat homolog and with other forms of c-erbA. Neither form of c-erbA alpha-2 binds T3 with high affinity whether synthesized in reticulocyte lysates or by transient expression in mammalian cells. Also, neither form increases the expression of a T3-responsive gene. However, human c-erbA alpha-2 inhibits T3 action mediated by a T3-receptor form of c-erbA to an extent similar to that of rat c-erbA alpha-2. Our data strongly suggest that human c-erbA alpha-2 has a biological function similar to that of its rat homolog. Thus, the modulation of T3 action by an endogenous inhibitor related to T3 receptors is likely a general regulatory mechanism.\r"

This TATA-box transcription factor was purified from extracts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using reconstitution of in vitro transcription reactions as an assay. The activity copurified with a protein whose sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel mobility is 25 kDa. The sequence of the amino-terminal 21 residues of this protein was determined by sequential Edman degradation. A yeast genomic library was screened with mixed oligonucleotides encoding six residues of the protein sequence. The yeast TATA-box factor gene was cloned, and DNA sequencing revealed a 720-base-pair open reading frame encoding a 27,016-Da protein. The identity of the clone was confirmed by expressing the gene in Escherichia coli and detecting TATA-box factor DNA binding and transcriptional activities in extracts of the recombinant E. coli. The TATA-box factor gene was mapped to chromosome five of S. cerevisiae. RNA blot hybridization and nuclease S1 analysis indicated that the major TATA-box factor mRNA is 1.3 kilobases, including an unusually long 5' untranslated region of 188 +/- 5 nucleotides. Homology searches showed a region of distant similarity to the calcium-binding structures of calpains, a structure that has a conformation similar to the helix-turn-helix motif of DNA binding proteins.\r"

This preferential inhibitory effect is elicited in as short a time as 4-24 hr postinfection. Likewise, antisense oligomers exhibit greater inhibitory effects on human immunodeficiency virus in chronically infected cells than do mismatched oligomers and homooligomers. Phosphorothioate antisene oligomers are up to 100 times more potent than unmodified oligomers of the same sequence in these inhibitory assays. These results, in major respects, confirm and extend those recently published by Matsukura et al. [Matsukura, M., Zon, G., Shinozuka, K., Robert-Guroff, M., Shimada, T., Stein, C. A., Mitsuza, H., Wong-Staal, F., Cohen, J. S. & Broder, S. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 4244-4248]. They also point out the importance of computer analysis of sequences though to be random but that in reality contain significant areas of likely hybridization, either to the viral genome or to the complementary DNA strand synthesized from it. They thus reinforce the concept that specific base pairing is a crucial feature of oligonucleotide inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus.\r"

The single-copy gene is expressed principally in liver, where it gives rise to a 2.4-kilobase mRNA. The islets of Langerhans of the pancreas also contain glucokinase. Using a cDNA complementary to rat liver glucokinase mRNA, we show that normal pancreatic islets and tumoral islet cells contain a glucokinase mRNA species approximately 400 nucleotides longer than hepatic mRNA. Hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides and primer-extension analysis show that the liver and islet glucokinase mRNAs differ in the 5' region. Glucokinase mRNA is absent from the livers of fasted rats and is strongly induced within hours by an oral glucose load. In contrast, islet glucokinase mRNA is expressed at a constant level during the fasting-refeeding cycle. The level of glucokinase protein in islets measured by immunoblotting is unaffected by fasting and refeeding, whereas a 3-fold increase in the amount of enzyme occurs in liver during the transition from fasting to refeeding. From these data, we conclude (i) that alternative splicing and/or the use of distinct tissue-specific promoters generate structurally distinct mRNA species in liver and islets of Langerhans and (ii) that tissue-specific transcription mechanisms result in inducible expression of the glucokinase gene in liver but not in islets during the fasting-refeeding transition.\r"

These findings suggest a tight physical coupling between the plasma membrane ATPase and the K+ channel.\r"

  ".W": "An alpha-amylase inhibitor that inhibits insect and mammalian alpha-amylases but not plant alpha-amylases, is present in seeds of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). We have purified the alpha-amylase inhibitor by using a selective heat treatment in acidic medium and affinity chromatography with porcine pancreas alpha-amylase coupled to agarose. Under sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, the purified inhibitor gave rise to five bands with mobilities corresponding to molecular masses ranging from 14 to 19 kDa. N-terminal sequencing (up to 15 amino acids) of the polypeptides obtained from these bands resulted in only two different sequences matching two stretches of the amino acid sequence deduced from an already described lectin gene [Hoffman, L. M. (1984) J. Mol. Appl. Gen. 2,447-453]. This gene is different from but closely related to the genes that code for phytohemagglutinin, the major lectin of bean. Further evidence based on amino acid composition, identification of a precursor, and recognition of the product of the gene (expressed in Escherichia coli) by an anti-alpha-amylase inhibitor serum confirms that the inhibitor is encoded by this or a closely related lectin gene. This finding assigns a biological function, which has been described at the molecular level, to a plant lectin gene product and supports the defense role postulated for seed lectins. The lack of homology with other families of enzyme inhibitors suggests that this may be the first member of a new family of plant enzyme inhibitors.\r"

Therefore, the ability to perform essential functions has been conserved between yeast and vertebrate calmodulins, suggesting that calmodulin performs the same (or overlapping) roles in yeast as it does in higher eukaryotes. Successful substitution of vertebrate for yeast calmodulin also suggests that the two proteins can adopt similar conformations in vivo, despite the large number of amino acid differences between them (60 out of 148 residues). Strains overproducing either vertebrate or yeast calmodulin about 100-fold and a strain producing a normal level of yeast calmodulin were essentially indistinguishable in many characteristics, including microtubule distribution, rate of secretion, response to mating pheromone, sporulation, and adaptation to nutrient limitation. Calmodulin overproduction did not confer elevated resistance to a phenothiazine drug, trifluoperazine, thought to be a calmodulin-specific inhibitor. These results have important implications for understanding the role of calmodulin in intracellular calcium signaling.\r"

When PDGF and insulin were replaced by purified human recombinant CSF-1, the cells became spindle shaped and refractile, were no longer contact inhibited, and proliferated to high densities. Thus, transduction of the human c-fms gene into mouse fibroblasts can not only reprogram their growth factor requirements but can also induce ligand-dependent features of cell transformation. NIH 3T3 cells stably transformed by the feline v-fms oncogene or by a mutated, oncogenic human c-fms gene were able to proliferate in the absence of exogenous growth factors. A monoclonal antibody that prevents signal transduction by the human CSF-1 receptor inhibited the growth of cells transformed by the activated c-fms oncogene, confirming that CSF-1 receptor function was required to abrogate growth factor requirements and to maintain the transformed state.\r"

The propagation speed is accurately measurable with a magnitude of about 1 micron/sec, and the wave persists for hundreds of generations (of duration less than 1 min). Evolution of RNA occurs in the wavefront, as established by front velocity changes and gel electrophoresis of samples drawn from along the capillary. The high population numbers (approximately equal to 10(11], their well-characterized biochemistry, their short generation time, and the constant conditions make the system ideal for evolution experiments. Growth is monitored continuously by excitation of an added RNA-sensitive fluorescent dye, ethidium bromide. An analytic expression for the front velocity is derived for the multicomponent kinetic scheme that reduces, for a high RNA-enzyme binding constant, to the Fisher form v = 2 square root of kappa D, where D is the diffusion constant of the complex and kappa is the low-concentration overall replication rate coefficient. The latter is confirmed as the selective value-determining parameter by numerical solution of a two-species system.\r"

  ".W": "The gamma origin binding sites of the replication initiator pi protein, composed of seven 22-base-pair (bp) direct repeats and previously shown to be essential for replication of plasmid R6K, can also act as an inhibitor of R6K replication in Escherichia coli cells if provided in trans. Inhibition is dependent upon the ability of these repeats to bind the R6K-encoded pi protein but is not overcome by increasing the intracellular pi level. The insertion of a second repeat cluster in close proximity to the gamma origin also can markedly inhibit replication. The severity of this effect is dependent upon the position, orientation, and number of repeats present in the extra cluster. As few as six extra repeats can result in a completely nonfunctional gamma origin. However, this inactive gamma origin plasmid containing the six extra repeats is functional when placed in a strain that underproduces the wild-type pi protein or when placed in the presence of any of several copy-up mutant pi proteins. On the basis of these observations, we propose that the nucleoprotein structures formed by the binding of pi protein to the seven 22-bp direct repeats at the gamma origin are capable of coupling with each other in vivo and that replication initiation is prevented at such coupled origins. In support of this model of replication control, we demonstrate by electron microscopy analysis that the pi protein has the ability to associate two DNA molecules containing gamma origin sequences and also show that pi enhances the DNA ligase-catalyzed multimerization of a DNA fragment containing the gamma origin.\r"

The cloned yeast gene was then used to generate a mutant strain of S. cerevisiae that carries a defect in the glycosylase gene and is extremely sensitive to DNA methylation.

The Sc. pombe gene encodes a 1692-amino acid-residue protein. The identity of this gene was confirmed by studies of its expression in Sa. cerevisiae. Expression of the carboxyl-terminal region of the Sc. pombe adenylyl cyclase protein will suppress a temperature-sensitive mutation in the Sa. cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase gene. Furthermore, Sa. cerevisiae that lack their endogenous adenylyl cyclase gene and express the carboxyl-terminal region of the Sc. pombe adenylyl cyclase protein have measurable adenylyl cyclase activity. The carboxyl-terminal region of this protein has strong homology with the catalytic domain of the Sa. cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase. Also, Sc. pombe adenylyl cyclase, like Sa. cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase, contains a tandemly repeated motif rich in leucine.

In contrast, IgG expression in .221 had these characteristics: (i) gamma 1 heavy chains were diminished by 98% but were detectable with chain-specific antibodies in cell lysates; (ii) kappa light chains were present at normal levels in cell lysates and free kappa chains were secreted; (iii) cell-surface-associated IgG and secreted IgG were absent. Mutants that had partially reduced amounts of class I antigens continued to secrete IgG; however, both the absolute amount of IgG secreted and the relative amount of kappa vs. intact IgG secreted were abnormal in such partially class I-deficient cells. The failure to export IgG and the deficiency of HLA-A, -B, and -C were not merely coincidental in mutant .221, since production of IgG was restored by transferring a functional HLA-A, -B, or -C gene into .221. Cell surface antigen expression of cloned HLA-A, -B, and -C transgenes introduced into .221 was comparable to that of the same genes in their normal chromosomal locations.

The actions of these six putative neurotransmitters converged onto three distinct potassium currents. Application of acetylcholine, histamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin all increased spiking by reducing spike-frequency adaptation, in part by reducing the current that underlies the slow after hyperpolarization. In addition, application of muscarinic receptor agonists to all neurons or of serotonin to middle-layer cells substantially reduced or blocked the M-current (a K+ current that is voltage and time dependent). Inhibition of neuronal firing was elicited by adenosine, baclofen (a gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor agonist), or serotonin and appeared to be due to an increase in the same potassium current by all three agents. These data reveal that individual neuronal currents in the human cerebral cortex are under the control of several putative neurotransmitters and that each neurotransmitter may exhibit more than one postsynaptic action. The specific anatomical connections of these various neurotransmitter systems, as well as their heterogeneous distribution of postsynaptic receptors and responses, allows each to make a specific contribution to the modulation of cortical activity.\r"

  ".U": "90046752\r", 
  ".W": "In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunocytochemistry were used to study the prenatal expression of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) cells in the mouse. Cells expressing LHRH mRNA and peptide product were first detected on embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) in the olfactory pit. On E12.5, the majority of LHRH cells were located on \"tracks\" extending from the olfactory pit to the base of the telencephalon. From E12.5 to E15.5, LHRH cells were detected in a rostral-to-caudal gradient in forebrain areas. Prior to E12.5, cells expressing LHRH mRNA were not detected in forebrain areas known to contain LHRH cells in postnatal animals. Quantitation of cells expressing LHRH mRNA showed that the number of labeled cells on E12.5 (approximately 800) equaled the number of LHRH cells in postnatal animals, but more than 90% of these cells were located in nasal regions. Between E12.5 and E15.5, the location of LHRH cells shifted. The number of LHRH cells in the forebrain increased, while the number of LHRH cells in nasal regions decreased over this same period. These findings establish that cells first found in the olfactory pit and thereafter in forebrain areas express the LHRH gene and correspond to the position of LHRH immunopositive cells found at these developmental times. To further examine the ontogeny of the LHRH system, immunocytochemistry in combination with [3H]thymidine autoradiography was used to determine when LHRH cells left the mitotic cycle. We show that LHRH neurons exhibit a discrete time of birth, suggesting that they arise as a single neuronal population between E10.0 and E11.0. Postnatal LHRH neurons were \"birth-dated\" shortly after differentiation of the olfactory placode and before LHRH mRNA was expressed in cells in the olfactory pit. Taken together, these studies support the hypothesis that all LHRH cells in the central nervous system arise from a discrete group of progenitor cells in the olfactory placode and that a subpopulation of these cells migrate into forebrain areas where they subsequently establish an adult-like distribution.\r"

  ".W": "Kindling is an animal model of epilepsy and neuronal plasticity produced by periodic electrical stimulation of the brain. Electrophysiologic studies indicate that this phenomenon is associated with increased participation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in excitatory synaptic transmission. Biochemical studies suggest that a change intrinsic to the NMDA receptor-channel complex may contribute to the increase in NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. We tested this idea by measuring the binding of 3-[(+)-2-(carboxypiperazin-4-yl)][1,2-3H]propyl-1-phosphonic acid ([3H]CPP), [3H]glycine, and tritiated N-[(1-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine [( 3H]TCP) to rat hippocampal membranes. In this preparation these ligands are selective for the NMDA receptor, the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor, and the NMDA receptor-gated ion channel, respectively. Kindling increased the density of CPP, glycine, and TCP binding sites in hippocampal membranes by 47%, 42%, and 25%, respectively. No significant changes were detected in the affinity of these binding sites. Surprisingly, alterations in the glycine binding site were detected in animals sacrificed 1 month but not 1 day after the final kindling stimulation. Thus, delayed upregulation of the NMDA receptor-channel complex may be one molecular mechanism that maintains the long-lasting hyperexcitability of hippocampal neurons in kindled animals.\r"

Here, we demonstrate that HIV-2 and SIVmac also encode functional Rev proteins. As in the case of HIV-1, these Rev trans-activators are shown to induce the cytoplasmic expression of the unspliced viral transcripts that encode the viral structural proteins. Unexpectedly, the Rev proteins of HIV-2 and SIVmac proved incapable of activating the cytoplasmic expression of unspliced HIV-1 transcripts, whereas HIV-1 Rev was fully functional in the HIV-2/SIV system. This nonreciprocal complementation may imply a direct role for Rev in mediating the recognition of its viral RNA target sequence.\r"

  ".W": "To probe the nature of the hydrophobic cores of proteins and to test potential ways of increasing protein thermostability, an attempt was made to improve the packing within T4 bacteriophage lysozyme by engineered amino acid replacements. Two mutations, Leu-133----Phe and Ala-129----Val, which were designed to fill the largest cavities that exist in the folded structure of the native protein, were constructed. The mutant proteins have normal activities and their thermal stabilities are marginally lower than that of wild-type lysozyme. Crystal structure analysis of the mutant proteins shows that the introduced amino acids are accommodated with very little perturbation of the three-dimensional structure. Incorporation of the more bulky hydrophobic residues within the core of the protein is expected to provide an increase in hydrophobic stabilization, but this is seen to be offset by the introduction of strain. Inspection of the mutant structures shows that in each case the introduced amino acid side chain is forced to adopt a non-optimal dihedral angle X1. Strain is also observed in the form of bond angle distortion and in unfavorable van der Waals contacts. The results illustrate how the observed core structures of proteins represent a compromise between the hydrophobic effect, which will tend to maximize the core packing density, and the strain energy that would be incurred in eliminating all packing defects. The results also suggest that mutations designed to increase protein stability by filling existing cavities may be effective in some cases but are unlikely to provide a general method for increasing protein stability.\r"

  ".W": "In a significant fraction of the Escherichia coli cytosolic proteins, the N-terminal methionine residue incorporated during the translation initiation step is excised. The N-terminal methionine excision is catalyzed by methionyl-aminopeptidase (MAP). Previous studies have suggested that the action of this enzyme could depend mainly on the nature of the second amino acid residue in the polypeptide chain. In this study, to achieve a systematic analysis of the specificity of MAP action, each of the 20 amino acids was introduced at the penultimate position of methionyl-tRNA synthetase of E. coli and the extent of in vivo methionine excision was measured. To facilitate variant protein purification and N-terminal sequence determination, an expression shuttle vector based on protein fusion with beta-galactosidase was used. From our results, methionine excision catalyzed by MAP is shown to obey the following rule: the catalytic efficiency of MAP, and therefore the extent of cleavage, decreases in parallel with the increasing of the maximal side-chain length of the amino acid in the penultimate position. This molecular model accounts for the rate of N-terminal methionine excision in E. coli, as deduced from the analysis of 100 protein N-terminal sequences.\r"

We studied the role of protein kinase C in the transformation-induced activation of the GT gene. Transformation of fibroblasts by either the v-fps or the Ki-ras oncogene rapidly increased the levels of GT mRNA. Either viral oncogene remained capable of stimulating the GT gene after depletion of cellular protein kinase C by prolonged pretreatment of fibroblasts with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

Similar transport systems, including the P-glycoprotein responsible for multidrug resistance in human tumors, are also found in eukaryotes. The mechanism by which energy is coupled to the accumulation of substrate by these transport systems has been controversial. In this paper we demonstrate that ATP hydrolysis occurs in vivo concomitantly with transport. These data strongly suggest that ATP hydrolysis directly energizes substrate accumulation by these transport systems. The apparent stoichiometry is one to two molecules of ATP hydrolyzed per molecule of substrate transported.\r"

These results imply that yeast has a protein or protein domain that serves the role of the histone H 1 found in higher cells; physical and genetic studies of the yeast activity could help elucidate the structure and function of H 1.

  ".U": "90046778\r", 
  ".W": "O6-Methylguanine (m6G) was incorporated site-specifically into two 25-base oligonucleotides differing only in the nucleotide on the 3' side of the modified base. Templates were primed with oligonucleotides terminating one or two bases prior to the site at which incorporation kinetics were to be investigated. Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) was used to determine the apparent Km and relative Vmax of incorporation of either dCTP or dTTP opposite m6G or G. These data were used to calculate the relative frequency of incorporation opposite the m6G or the unmodified G. When the sequence was 3'-Cm6G-5', there was a 6- to 7-fold preference for formation of a m6G.T pair compared with m6G.C. The m6G.T frequency, based on Vmax/Km, was at least 50-fold greater than that of a G.T pair at the same site. Changing the sequence to 3'-Tm6G-5' had a marked effect on both Km and Vmax of pairs containing m6G and on the incorporation frequency of T opposite m6G, which was then only slightly favored over m6G.C. When replication was started directly opposite m6G, the kinetics appeared unaffected. These data indicate that the frequency of incorporation of C or T opposite m6G in a DNA template is dependent on the flanking neighbors and that a change of even a single base at the 3' position can have a major effect on mutagenic efficiency. Replication using Drosophila Pol alpha gave the same values for relative frequencies. Pairing of either C or T with m6G on the primer terminus did not significantly inhibit extension of the next normal base pair, in contrast to terminal mismatches of unmodified bases. It is concluded that, in the absence of repair, m6G can exhibit widely differing mutation frequencies which, in these experiments, can be as high as 85% of the replicated base. This variation in frequency of changed pairing could contribute to the occurrence of mutational \"'hot spots\" after replication of damaged DNA.\r"

Overproduction of each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (20- to 80-fold) was accompanied by a significant increase in intracellular Ap4N concentration (3- to 14-fold). As expected, non-adenylylated bis(5'-nucleosidyl) tetraphosphate concentration was not changed by synthetase overproduction. It was also verified that overproduction of an inactive methionyl-tRNA synthetase mutant did not modify Ap4N concentration. Ap4N accumulation during heat shock occurred in all strains studied. The increase factor (approximately 50-fold after 1 hr at 48 degrees C) was not changed by overproduction of any of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases studied, including that of the heat-inducible form of lysyl-tRNA synthetase from the lysU gene. Together, these results establish that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are involved in Ap4N biosynthesis during exponential growth as well as during heat shock.\r"

To delineate the domains involved in subunit interactions, we have examined the effects of deletions and point mutations in the glutaminase and synthetase subunits on formation of the alpha beta holoenzyme. Deletion of the amino-terminal third of the glutaminase subunit abolishes interactions with the synthetase subunit, suggesting that this domain functions to stabilize the complex. Two subunit binding domains have been identified in the synthetase subunit. They are homologous to one another and are located in the amino-terminal and central regions of the synthetase component. These domains are adjacent to regions of the synthetase previously proposed to be involved in ATP binding and, possibly, activation of CO2. The new data enlarge the definition of the structural and functional domains in the two interdependent components of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase.\r"

Yeast a-factor mating hormone precursor also possesses a COOH-terminal Cys-Ali-Ali-Xaa sequence. However, while the COOH-terminal cysteine has been implicated as a site of palmitoylation of ras proteins, in mature a-type mating factor this residue is modified by an isoprenoid, a farnesyl moiety. We asked whether the Cys-Ali-Ali-Xaa sequence signaled different modifications for the yeast peptides (farnesylation) than for ras proteins (palmitoylation) or whether ras proteins were similar to the mating factors and contained a previously undiscovered isoprenoid. We report here that the processing of ras proteins involves addition of a farnesyl moiety, apparently at the COOH-terminal cysteine analogous to the cysteine modified in the yeast peptides, and that farnesylation may be important for membrane association and transforming activity of ras proteins.\r"

We have analyzed the mechanism for HIV-1 RT infidelity by studying two distinct steps that might lead to base substitution mutations: nucleotide misinsertions and elongation from 3'-terminal DNA mispairs. Our results indicate that the capacity of HIV-1 RT to polymerize nucleotides onto mispaired termini is a major factor in the production of mutations by this enzyme. When a noncomplementary dAMP was inserted opposite a template adenine by HIV-1 RT, the nascent 3'-terminal A.A mispair was readily extended by subsequent incorporation of the next complementary nucleotide. The frequencies of nucleotide addition onto 3'-terminal A-A, A-C, and A-G mispairs were determined by quantitating the amount of extended primers with a gel electrophoresis assay and by measuring mutagenesis after hybridization of mismatched primers opposite an amber mutation in bacteriophage phi X174 DNA. The mispair extension frequencies are approximately 50-fold higher by HIV-1 RT than by the mammalian replicative enzyme DNA polymerase alpha.\r"

The IRGT was immunoprecipitated from either detergent-solubilized whole-cell homogenates or subcellular fractions of 32P-labeled fat cells and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 32P-labeled IRGT was detected by autoradiography as a species of apparent Mr 46,000. Insulin stimulated translocation of the IRGT from low-density microsomes to the plasma membrane but did not affect phosphorylation of the transporter in either fraction. Isoproterenol inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport by 40% but was without effect on the subcellular distribution of the transporter in either the presence or absence of insulin. Isoproterenol stimulated phosphorylation of the IRGT 2-fold. Incubating cells with dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP also stimulated phosphorylation 2-fold, and the transporter was phosphorylated in vitro when IRGT-enriched vesicles were incubated with cAMP-dependent protein kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP. These results suggest that isoproterenol stimulates phosphorylation of the IRGT via a cAMP-dependent pathway and that phosphorylation of the transporter may modulate its ability to transport glucose.\r"

The amino acid sequences of the chicken and rat enzymes are 67% identical. If conservative substitutions are allowed, 78% of the amino acids are matched. A region of low homologies exists between the functional domains, in particular around amino acid residues 1059-1264 of the chicken enzyme. Homologies between the active sites of chicken and rat and of chicken and yeast enzymes have been analyzed by an alignment method. A high degree of homology exists between the active sites of the chicken and rat enzymes. However, the chicken and yeast enzymes show a lower degree of homology. The NADPH-binding dinucleotide folds of the beta-ketoacyl reductase and the enoyl reductase sites were identified by comparison with a known consensus sequence for the NADP- and FAD-binding dinucleotide folds. The active sites of all of the enzymes are primarily in hydrophobic regions of the protein. This study suggests that the genes for the functional domains of fatty acid synthase were originally separated, and these genes were connected to each other by using different connecting nucleotide sequences in different species. An alternative explanation for the differences in rat and chicken is a common ancestry and mutations in the joining regions during evolution. A higher mutation rate in the joining regions than in the active site regions of the enzymes without loss of function might be expected.\r"

Because the binding of ACE1 to DNA is dependent on Cu, it is possible to inhibit transcription by the use of Cu-complexing agents such as CN-. We have used this specific inhibition to show that the ACE1 regulatory protein is required for the maintenance as well as the formation of a functional preinitiation complex.

We detected previously identified RNAs of 3.3, 2.3, and 2.0 kilobases (kb) that code for core antigen, large surface antigen, and middle/major surface antigen, respectively. We also detected four additional RNAs of 2.1, 1.7, 1.1, and 0.7 kb [the lengths exclude the poly(A) tail]. S1 mapping and nucleotide sequencing data showed that the 2.1-kb RNA is a spliced RNA whose 5' and 3' ends are identical to those of the 3.3-kb RNA. The results suggest that the 2.1-kb RNA codes for an altered core antigen lacking the last amino acid, cysteine, and that expression of the 3.3-kb pregenomic RNA is regulated, at least in part, by splicing. The map positions of the 1.7- and 1.1-kb RNAs suggest that they code for the carboxyl-terminal portions of the putative polymerase, whereas the 0.7-kb RNA codes for the X protein.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that viruses play a role in the etiology of various autoimmune diseases has been proposed. One approach to the search for these agents involves identifying potential crossreactive epitopes in viruses that infect cells of the immune system or of the target tissues. Antibodies to DNA topoisomerase I are the marker autoantibodies for diffuse systemic sclerosis. The major epitope of the antigen was therefore sought through cloning and sequencing of the cDNA for human topoisomerase I and eventually by the synthesis of the smallest possible peptide recognized by sera from patients with the diffuse form of systemic sclerosis. The antigenic 11-amino acid sequence contains 6 sequential amino acids that are identical to a sequence present in the group-specific antigen (p30gag) of some mammalian retroviruses. This sequence is separated by only 1 amino acid from the retroviral epitope sequence that crossreacts with autoantibodies against the marker antigen for mixed connective-tissue disease and systemic lupus erythematosus, the 70-kDa polypeptide of U1 ribonucleoprotein particles. These findings suggest that a retroviral agent may be involved in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis and other connective tissue diseases and that antibodies to intracellular antigens are not involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease but may be useful as footprints for tracking the potential etiological agent of autoimmune disease.\r"

  ".W": "CD44 is a glycoprotein that participates in adhesion of lymphocytes to high endothelial cells of lymph organs and likely functions in other intercellular adhesions as well. We have isolated a mouse CD44 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA synthesized from total cellular RNA isolated from 38C-13, a B-lymphocyte cell line. The oligonucleotide sequences were based at the 5' end on the baboon CD44 sequence upstream of and including the translation initiator ATG and at the 3' end on a mouse CD44 sequence that was determined from a rare, incomplete cDNA clone. The mouse CD44 DNA sequence is similar to the baboon CD44 sequence but has structural features that are distinct. The external domain has a region that is only 35% similar between the mouse and primate proteins, in contrast to 85%-90% similarity in the rest of the sequence. In addition, just upstream from the predicted cleavage site of the leader peptide, nucleotide insertions result in the addition of two or four amino acids, depending upon the mouse strain. An amino acid replacement between two strains carrying different CD44 (also called Pgp-1) allotypes is likely responsible for the Pgp-1 polymorphism. The most striking aspect of mouse CD44 is that the RNA does not fractionate with polyadenylylated RNA, unlike the CD44 RNA in human, baboon, rat, and chicken.\r"

(R,S)-5-(4'-aminophenyl)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3- methyl-[1H]-3-benzazepin-7-ol, the 4'-amino derivative of the high-affinity D1-specific antagonist SCH 23390, and the D2 selective antagonist N-(p-aminophenethyl)spiperone were chemically derivatized using the fluorescent compound tetramethylrhodamine. The modification of these antagonist ligands has allowed the specific, cellular resolution of the D1 and D2 receptor binding sites in intact, highly organized regions of forebrain slices in a very rapid experimental time frame. The regional localization of receptors labeled by the fluorescent probes is in agreement with previous receptor autoradiography studies. Moreover, the specific cellular binding patterns for both receptors can now be compared and contrasted to one another in the same tissue by using these fluorescent ligands. D1 receptor sites are most evident within the striatum and exhibit regions of intense \"patch\" fluorescence corresponding to receptor reactivity in cells and their processes. The distribution of D1 receptor binding is highly analogous to the pattern of dopamine terminal histofluorescence in the caudate nucleus. D2 receptor sites are less prevalent overall and may be localized to a subpopulation of the D1 fluorescent neurons in the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens regions.\r"

In the ventral striatum of patients with Alzheimer disease, a 60% decrease in the number of cholinergic neurons was observed, whereas in the caudate nucleus and putamen values for control subjects and patients were similar.

Furthermore, the disulfide arrangements of these two proteins appear identical, suggesting related overall conformations. However, the polypeptide, now named PEC-60 (peptide with N-terminal glutamic acid, C-terminal cysteine, and a total of 60 residues), was found not to inhibit trypsin. The amino acid sequence is also similar to that of a peptide recently isolated from rat bile/pancreatic juice which stimulates the release of cholecystokinin. The biological role of PEC-60 is not known, but the effect on insulin secretion and the homologies observed suggest important biological activities and interesting structural relationships.\r"

Consistent with the recent conclusion that P. carinii is a member of the Fungi, sequence analysis and chromosomal localization show that DHFR is neither physically nor genetically linked to thymidylate synthase. Expression of recombinant P. carinii DHFR in heterologous hosts provides an abundant source of the enzyme that may form a basis for the development of new therapies for this enigmatic pathogen. Studies with the recombinant enzyme show that trimethoprim is a very poor inhibitor of P. carinii DHFR and, in fact, is a more potent inhibitor of human DHFR.\r"

(1989) EMBO J. 8, 961-966]. This reaction is saturable, with Michaelis-Menten kinetics for an enzyme with two substrates, ATP and pro-OmpA, and is defined as translocation ATPase. Another precursor protein, pre-PhoE, is also a substrate for this translocation ATPase. Neither OmpA nor its synthetic leader peptide are effective substrates for translocation ATPase, suggesting that both domains of the complete precursor are necessary for the reaction. The leader peptide is a potent inhibitor and apparently competes with pro-OmpA for necessary binding sites on translocation ATPase. After a brief preincubation, the activity of translocation ATPase becomes resistant to inhibition by leader peptide, suggesting that the leader peptide is recognized at an early step in the protein translocation pathway. Our enzymological studies show that translocation ATPase recognizes and functionally binds the leader region of precursor proteins.\r"

This enzyme, a dimer of identical 416-residue subunits, is inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser-113, which lies at the edge of an interdomain pocket that also contains many residues conserved between isocitrate dehydrogenase and isopropylmalate dehydrogenase. Isocitrate dehydrogenase contains an unusual clasp-like domain in which both polypeptide chains in the dimer interlock. Based on the structure of isocitrate dehydrogenase and conservation with isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, we suggest that the active site lies in an interdomain pocket close to the phosphorylation site.\r"

This cassette has been used to evaluate the mutagenicity of O6-substituted guanine residues, including O6-methylguanine and O6-benzylguanine, incorporated within the 12th codon of this locus. Mutations were monitored by the ability of these modified Ha-ras DNAs to transform Rat4 TK-cells. Our results indicate that both types of O6-substituted guanines are substantially mutagenic, although the methyl substituent induced a 2-fold higher percentage of transformed Rat4 TK+ colonies than its bulkier benzyl analogue. Interestingly, the mutagenicity of both O6-substituted guanines was found to be independent of their relative position within codon 12, therefore suggesting that the specific activation of Ha-ras oncogenes by GGA----GAA mutations in tumors induced by methylating carcinogens might be due to differences in the accessibility of these guanine residues to the carcinogen rather than to a differential rate of repair. Molecular analysis of the mutations induced by these O6-substituted guanines indicated that O6-methylguanine exclusively induced G----A transitions. In contrast, O6-benzylguanine produced G----C and G----T transversions in addition to G----A transitions. These results suggest that O6-methylguanine and its bulkier analogue O6-benzylguanine may induce mutagenesis by different mechanisms.\r"

We treated inner-membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli with mixtures of octyl beta-D-glucoside, phospholipids, and an integral membrane carrier protein under conditions that extract most of the membrane proteins into micellar solution. Upon dialysis, proteoliposomes were reconstituted that supported translocation of radiochemically pure [35S]pro-OmpA (the precursor of outer membrane protein A). Translocation into these proteoliposomes required ATP hydrolysis and membrane proteins, indicating that the reaction is that of the inner membrane. The suspension of membranes in detergent was separated into supernatant and pellet fractions by ultracentrifugation. After reconstitution, translocation activity was observed in both fractions, but processing by leader peptidase of translocated pro-OmpA to OmpA was not detectable in the reconstituted pellet fraction. Processing activity was restored by addition of pure leader peptidase as long as this enzyme was added before detergent removal, indicating that the translocation activity is not associated with detergent-resistant membrane vesicles. These results show that protein translocation activity can be recovered from detergent-disrupted membrane vesicles, providing a first step towards the goal of isolating the solubilized components.\r"

This modified p21 protein has been introduced quantitatively into NIH 3T3 cells using an erythrocyte-mediated fusion technique. The introduced p21 protein was capable of inducing enhanced pinocytosis and DNA synthesis in the recipient cells. To identify the putative intracellular protein(s) that specifically interact with the modified p21 protein, the cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine at selected times after fusion and then UV-irradiated to activate the azide group. The resulting nitrene covalently binds to amino acid residues in adjacent proteins, thus linking the p21 protein to these proteins. The cells were then lysed, and the lysate was immunoprecipitated with the anti-p21 monoclonal antibody Y13-259. The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS/PAGE to identify p21-protein complexes. By using this technique, we found that three protein complexes of 51, 64, and 82 kDa were labeled specifically and reproducibly. The most prominent band is the 64-kDa protein complex that shows a time-dependent rise and fall, peaking within a 5-hr period after introduction of the p21 protein into the cells. These studies provide evidence that in vitro the p21 protein becomes associated with a protein whose mass is about 43 kDa. We suggest that the formation of this complex may play a role in mediating early events involved with cell transformation induced by RAS oncogenes.\r"
