  ".W": "Three boys, 5.0-7.4 yr of age, with clinical and biochemical features consistent with familial gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (\"testotoxicosis\") were treated with the antifungal drug ketoconazole in a dose of 200 mg every 8 h. Serum testosterone levels fell significantly within 24 h in all three patients, with reciprocal changes in serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone, consistent with inhibition of C17-20 lyase activity. However, after 1-3 months of continuing treatment, an \"escape\" phenomenon occurred, characterized by progressive increases in serum LH, FSH, and testosterone concentrations. Furthermore, for the first time, a marked pubertal-type LH response was found after GnRH administration in contrast to the absent response consistently found in all patients before ketoconazole therapy. Combination treatment with ketoconazole and the GnRH analog buserelin resulted in restoration of pituitary and gonadal hormone concentrations to the upper range of normal for prepubertal children. We hypothesize that the advanced state of maturation of the boys in this study [mean bone age, 13.2 +/- 0.8 (+/- SE) yr] was the major contributing factor to this escape, with the set-point of the GnRH pulse generator (gonadostat) functioning at the adult level of sensitivity. Such escape may limit the successful use of ketoconazole alone. These data together with evidence of normal testosterone responses to hCG during ketoconazole therapy indicate that in testotoxicosis, pituitary and gonadal receptors are functionally intact, with appropriate negative feedback relationships.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that circulating beta-endorphin levels are increased in obese hirsute women and that plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels are increased in proportion to the degree of hyperandrogenism in women with the polycystic ovary (PCO) syndrome. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that endogenous opiates are at least partially responsible for the hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in this syndrome. In the first study, acute naloxone administration significantly reduced the plasma IRI response and IRI/glucose ratio in three euglycemic obese women with PCO and acanthosis nigricans (AN) and marked insulin resistance, but did not alter the glucose response. Naloxone had no effect on these parameters in the normal weight control subjects. In the second study, nalmefene, a new, orally active opiate antagonist, reduced IRI and the IRI/glucose ratio in four women with PCO-AN and marked hyperinsulinemia in a randomized, double blind, crossover protocol. We conclude that endogenous opiates are at least partially responsible for the hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in PCO-AN.\r"

Biphasic insulin release from vitamin A-deficient perifused islets was markedly impaired. Release remained impaired with retinoic acid (RA) repletion, 2 micrograms/g diet compared to release from islets of rats repleted with retinol in the form of retinyl palmitate, 4 micrograms/g diet. Release normalized with RA, 8 micrograms/g diet. Vitamin A deficiency did not affect islet insulin content, cell size, number or structure. In vivo, vitamin A-deficient rats had impaired glucose-induced acute insulin release and glucose intolerance, which improved with repletion. Normal islets had greater concentrations of CRBP than CRABP; vitamin A deficiency reduced CRBP but not CRABP levels. We conclude retinol is required for normal insulin secretion. Retinoic acid may substitute for retinol in this function.\r"

Results showed that both insulin and T3 can stimulate cell growth of serum starved Hep3B cells at physiological concentrations. SRIF alone showed little growth-promoting activity. When added concurrently with insulin, however, SRIF suppressed the insulin-induced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, SRIF had no inhibitory effect on T3-induced cell proliferation. SRIF is labile in the medium, with a half-life of about 2 h during culture incubation. SRIF did not disturb the insulin binding to its surface receptors nor inhibit the insulin-dependent receptor kinase activity of Hep3B cells in vitro. These results suggest that postreceptor regulation may be involved. The selective suppression by SRIF of insulin-induced cell growth provides an unique approach to the study of insulin actions on proliferation of human hepatoma cells.\r"

In contrast, six of seven normal controls lacked enzymatic activity. Levels of free immunoreactive kinin found in BAL fluid correlated with the presence of kininogenase activity (P = 0.002). The cleavage pattern of 125I-HMWK by the BAL fluid kininogenase (a dominant 65,000-mol wt fragment), and synthetic inhibitor profile (phe-phe-arg-CH2Cl and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were compatible with a tissue kallikrein. Peak kininogenase activity eluted at an apparent molecular weight of 20,000-34,000 by HPLC gel filtration. Its antigenic identity was established by immunoblotting with anti-human urinary kallikrein antibody and its activity was inhibited by this antibody. Lysylbradykinin was generated during incubation of fractionated BAL fluid and purified HMWK, the characteristic cleavage product of the tissue kallikreins. We conclude that elevated amounts of tissue kallikrein and kinin are present in the bronchoalveolar spaces of asthmatic subjects. Kinin generation may contribute to the asthmatic response directly through edema formation and smooth muscle contraction and by augmenting release and/or production of preformed (histamine) and secondary mediators such as leukotrienes and platelet-activating factor.\r"

In normal dogs made hyperglucagonemic by phloridzin pretreatment, insulin and somatostatin suppressed glucagon at rates of 47 +/- 8 and 35 +/- 8%/h (NS), respectively, despite profound hypoglycemia. In severely hyperglycemic alloxan-diabetic dogs, insulin and somatostatin suppressed glucagon at rates of 48 +/- 13 and 54 +/- 6%/h, respectively, not different from the nondiabetic dogs. After phloridzin pretreatment to eliminate hyperglycemia in the diabetic dogs, insulin and somatostatin suppressed 51 +/- 8 and 31 +/- 10%/h (NS), respectively. Glucose infused in the phloridzin-pretreated insulin-deprived group suppressed glucagon only partially; insulin was required to reduce it further. We conclude that insulin and somatostatin suppress glucagon at similar rates irrespective of ambient glucose levels, and that diabetic hyperglucagonemia represents the summation of stimulation by insulin lack minus suppression by the associated hyperglycemia.\r"

Palmitate flux was determined isotopically ([1-14C]palmitate) before and during epinephrine infusion in normal volunteers after a 14-h (day 1) and an 84-h (day 4) fast. Using a pancreatic clamp, constant plasma hormone and glucose concentrations were achieved on both study days in seven subjects. Six subjects were infused with saline and served as controls. During the pancreatic clamp, palmitate flux was greater (P less than 0.01) on day 4 than day 1, despite similar plasma insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and glucose concentrations. The lipolytic response to epinephrine was greater (P less than 0.05) on day 4 than day 1 in both groups of subjects. In conclusion, lipolysis during fasting is less completely suppressed by insulin and more readily stimulated by epinephrine.\r"

Incubation of receptors at 4 degrees C with [gamma-32P]ATP and insulin resulted in a maximal 10-12-fold increase in autophosphorylation of the 92-kDa beta-subunit of the receptor with a half maximal effect at 1-3 ng/ml free insulin. Insulin receptor kinase activity in the three experimental groups was measured by means of both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate Glu4:Tyr1. In the absence of insulin, autophosphorylation and Glu4:Tyr1 phosphorylation activities, measured with equal numbers of insulin receptors, were comparable among the three groups. In contrast, insulin-stimulated kinase activity was comparable in the control and obese subjects, but was reduced by approximately 50% in the NIDDM group. These findings indicate that the decrease in kinase activity in NIDDM resulted from a reduction in coupling efficiency between insulin binding and activation of the receptor kinase. The insulin receptor kinase defects observed in NIDDM could be etiologically related to insulin resistance in NIDDM and the pathogenesis of the diabetic state.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the role of reactive oxygen metabolites in the degradation of human glomerular basement membrane (GBM) by stimulated human neutrophils. Neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) caused a significant degradation of GBM over 3 h resulting in 11.4 +/- 0.9% (SEM), n = 11 release of hydroxyproline compared with 0.3 +/- 0.09%, n = 11 release by unstimulated neutrophils. Superoxide dismutase, a scavenger of superoxide, did not inhibit the GBM degradation, whereas catalase, a scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, caused a marked inhibition (-60 +/- 7%, n = 4, P less than 0.001) of hydroxyproline release. Neither alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, an inhibitor of elastase, nor soya bean trypsin inhibitor, an inhibitor of cathepsin G, caused any significant inhibition of GBM degradation. GBM degradation by cell-free supernatants obtained from stimulated neutrophils was markedly impaired in the presence of metal chelators EDTA (-72 +/- 7, n = 6, P less than 0.001) and 1,10,phenanthroline (-85 +/- 5%, n = 3, P less than 0.001). Considering these results, we postulated that reactive oxygen metabolites generated by the stimulated neutrophils activate a latent GBM degrading metalloproteinase(s). GBM degradation by supernatants obtained from incubations with catalase, azide, an inhibitor of myeloperoxidase, and methionine and taurine, scavengers of hypochlorous acid, was markedly reduced. Our data thus indicate that degradation of the GBM by PMA-stimulated neutrophils is due to activation of a latent metalloproteinase by hypochlorous acid or a similar oxidant generated by the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-halide system.\r"

In part, this is due to the absence of the complement regulatory protein, decay accelerating factor (DAF). A small number of patients with PNH have gone on to develop acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, which is thought to arise from the injured marrow as a second hematopoietic disorder. We have studied a patient with PNH who developed acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML); the blasts from this patient were found to lack DAF as measured by polyclonal antibody binding and fluorescence flow cytometry as well as by immunoblotting. The blasts from 11 other patients with AML bound anti-DAF antibody in amounts similar to normal mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Cells of the human leukemia cell lines HL-60, K562, U937, and HEL also bound anti-DAF antibody. In addition to DAF deficiency, blasts from the PNH patient had undetectable alkaline phosphatase activity, in contrast to human leukemia cell lines. These data suggest that the leukemic cells of the PNH patient arose out of the PNH clone and that AML in the setting of PNH is not a separate disorder.\r"

Treatment with ECGF for 24 h decreased the incorporation of [3H]proline into collagen but treatment for 48-96 h increased collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis, an effect that was concomitant with an increase in DNA content. ECGF did not alter collagen degradation in calvariae or 45Ca release from long bones, which indicated it had no effect on bone resorption. Although ECGF increased prostaglandin E2 concentrations, its effect on DNA synthesis was not prostaglandin-mediated. In conclusion, ECGF stimulates calvarial DNA synthesis, which is an effect that results in a generalized increase in protein synthesis, but ECGF has no effect on matrix degradation or bone resorption.\r"

Scleroderma sera immunoprecipitated 13 polypeptides from [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cell extract with molecular weights ranging from 210,000 to 14,000. Similar polypeptides were precipitated by rabbit anti-RNA polymerase I antibodies, and their common identities were confirmed in immunoabsorption experiments. Microinjection of purified IgG from a patient with speckled nucleolar staining effectively inhibited ribosomal RNA transcription.

Deletion of the genetically predicted antigen was twice as common in tumours of pT1 or greater stage than those of pTa stage and also twice as common in poorly differentiated than in moderately well differentiated tumours. The considerable heterogeneity and overlap, however, in patterns of reactivity in tumours of various histopathological stages and grades and the effect of secretor status on antigenicity meant that there was no obvious antigenic feature that correlated precisely with invasive stage or differentiation grade. It remains to be determined whether the antigen positive and antigen negative tumours represent different disease entities with differing clinical courses. Our results indicate, however, that studies of the blood group antigens in urinary tract tumours are more likely to be of value in research into biochemical disorders in the neoplastic process than in routine clinical assessment as a guide to treatment.\r"

Nine of 31 patients (29%) with Bell's palsy and eight of 12 patients (75%) with Ramsey-Hunt syndrome had anticomplement immunofluorescence antibody titres of greater than or equal to 1/10. On the other hand, none of 14 patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and 51 healthy adults showed anticomplement immunofluorescence antibody titres of greater than or equal to 1/10. The anticomplement immunofluorescence antibody titre in two patients with Ramsey-Hunt syndrome increased later and decreased sooner than the indirect immunofluorescence antibody titre, becoming undetectable at 66 and 104 days, respectively, after onset of the disease. There was no cross reaction between anti-VZV and anti-HSV antibodies in the patients who showed a positive antibody rise for VZV. As the acute stage of VZV infection is obscure in the patients with peripheral facial palsy without herpes the screening of anticomplement immunofluorescence antibody to VZV at titres greater than or equal to 1/10 may be useful for the diagnosis of VZV infection in patients with peripheral facial palsy.\r"

During the treatment period, the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio was significantly lower in the timolol-treated group, indicating better left ventricular function than in the placebo-treated patients. In the 27 patients who died during the follow-up period of 50 to 72 months, there was a significant increase in the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio from baseline to the last performed recording, indicating a deterioration in left ventricular performance in these patients. No such change occurred in the group that survived the entire follow-up period. Deterioration of left ventricular function is related to a high long-term mortality rate after myocardial infarction, and left ventricular function is better preserved in patients treated with timolol than in patients receiving placebo.\r"

Therefore, 150 consecutive patients with creatine kinase isoenzyme-confirmed acute uncomplicated myocardial infarction who had ST segment elevation of 1 mm or more in at least two contiguous leads on the admission electrocardiogram were analyzed. None received thrombolytic therapy or acute coronary angioplasty. Predischarge angiography, radionuclide ventriculography and exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy were performed 10 +/- 3 days after myocardial infarction. Based on serial electrocardiograms (on days 1, 2, 3 and 10), all 150 infarcts were classified as Q wave (n = 115 [77%]) or non-Q wave (n = 35 [23%]). Although patients with Q wave infarction exhibited greater ST elevation, the amount observed in the non-Q wave group was appreciable, as reflected by the number of leads with ST elevation (3.8 +/- 1.8 versus 3.1 +/- 1.2, p = 0.007) and the sum of the ST elevation (9.6 +/- 7.4 versus 6.2 +/- 6.2 mm, p = 0.016). When compared with the Q wave group, patients with non-Q wave infarction had a shorter time to peak creatine kinase (23.0 +/- 9.1 versus 15.8 +/- 7.9 hours, p = 0.0001), a higher infarct vessel patency rate (24 versus 57%, p = 0.001), lower peak creatine kinase values based on 4 hour sampling (1,372 +/- 964 versus 664 +/- 924 IU/liter, p = 0.0002) and a higher left ventricular ejection fraction (46 +/- 12% versus 54 +/- 9%, p = 0.0003).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Long-term mortality and morbidity of 1,741 patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with intravenous streptokinase (1.5 million IU/h) or placebo, was assessed in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial (ISAM). At the 7 month follow-up, 94 (10.9%) of the 859 patients in the streptokinase group and 98 (11.1%) of the 882 patients in the placebo group had died; at an average follow-up of 21 months, 14.4% of the streptokinase group and 16.1% of the placebo group had died. The differences were not statistically significant. Long-term mortality was slightly higher in patients with anterior myocardial infarction and streptokinase treatment (20.1 versus 18.4%) and lower in patients with inferior myocardial infarction (10.2 versus 14.2%). Patients with previous myocardial infarction had a higher long-term mortality rate with streptokinase (34.9 versus 21.5% with placebo, p = 0.03). At 7 months, there were significantly more cases of reinfarction in the streptokinase group (7.2 versus 4.5%, p = 0.02). It is concluded that despite a significant limitation of infarct size by intravenous streptokinase, long-term mortality is only slightly reduced and reinfarction is significantly more frequent. Both findings suggest the need for complementary therapy such as revascularization procedures after thrombolysis.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to assess the potential for rapid acquisition computed axial tomography (Imatron C-100) to quantify regional myocardial perfusion. Myocardial and left ventricular cavity contrast clearance curves were constructed after injecting nonionic contrast (1 ml/kg over 2 to 3 seconds) into the inferior vena cava of six anesthetized, closed chest dogs (n = 14). Independent myocardial perfusion measurements were obtained by coincident injection of radiolabeled microspheres into the left atrium during control, intermediate and maximal myocardial vasodilation with adenosine (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg per min, intravenously, respectively). At each flow state, 40 serial short-axis scans of the left ventricle were taken near end-diastole at the midpapillary muscle level. Contrast clearance curves were generated and analyzed from the left ventricular cavity and posterior papillary muscle regions after excluding contrast recirculation and minimizing partial volume effects. The area under the curve (gamma variate function) was determined for a region of interest placed within the left ventricular cavity. Characteristics of contrast clearance data from the posterior papillary muscle region that were evaluated included the peak myocardial opacification, area under the contrast clearance curve and a contrast clearance time defined by the full width/half maximal extent of the clearance curve. Myocardial perfusion (microspheres) ranged from 35 to 450 ml/100 g per min (mean 167 +/- 125). Two flow algorithms derived from characteristics of the contrast clearance curves showed a good correlation with regional myocardial flow determined by microspheres: the ratio of the peak myocardial opacification from baseline to the area under the left ventricular cavity curve (r = 0.7, p less than 0.001, SEE = 44.4 ml/min), and the ratio of the left ventricular cavity to posterior papillary muscle curve areas divided by the full width/half maximal contrast transit time in the region of the posterior papillary muscle (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001, SEE = 52.2 ml/100 g per min). The form of these two flow algorithms was derived from classical indicator dilution theory. In conclusion, indices derived from these data correlated well with regional myocardial perfusion in the posterior papillary muscle region of the dog as assessed by microspheres. This approach offers promise for the quantitation of regional myocardial perfusion and myocardial flow reserve in patients.\r"

  ".W": "The primary goal of diabetes management is to maintain blood glucose as near to normal as possible. Composition, size, and spacing of meals and snacks all have a substantial impact on blood glucose fluctuations and can be altered to improve glycemic control. Recent research studies focusing on the blood glucose response of various carbohydrate containing foods have found that responses vary considerably. Because the glucose response is influenced by numerous factors, it is difficult to predict how specific individuals will respond to a particular food. A technique known as self-blood glucose monitoring can be used by patients with diabetes to quantitate their own postprandial glucose rise from various foods. The technique itself is portable and relatively simple and is an accurate means of obtaining blood glucose values without using a clinical laboratory. Self-blood testing provides the patient with immediate feedback on the impact of dietary manipulation. Blood glucose records can be used in conjunction with diet records to make adjustments in the type and amount of food or insulin dose that would elicit the best glycemic response. The dietitian thus plays an integral role in identifying patterns in the blood glucose profile and assisting the patient in making intelligent dietary choices to improve diabetes control.\r"

Bacteria adhered significantly better to cells of young women than young men (p less than .0001) and elderly women than elderly men (p less than .03). The greatest adherence was in young women and the least in young men. In women without bacteriuria, aging was not associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial attachment. Moreover, there was no increase in the adherence of E. coil strains to uroepithelial cells of bacteriuric elderly women in comparison to abacteriuric elderly women. In men, however, aging was associated with increased bacterial adherence (p less than .02). Susceptibility to bacterial adherence does not appear to be responsible for the increased frequency of E. coli bacteriuria in elderly women but may be a permissive factor in elderly men.\r"

Ability to use the system properly correlated with improvement in symptoms; inability to use the device was most clearly related to severity of clinical presentation. It is concluded that the use of aerosolized bronchodilators is feasible in prehospital care and most useful in patients with mild or moderately severe symptoms.\r"

The fourth group (TLI) received 1700 rad fractionated total lymphoid irradiation ending on day -1. The animals treated with TLI were markedly delayed in the onset of AMIA, which was suppressed to less than 1% of the control group. The AMIA specific for the constant region of animals receiving PI was also suppressed to one-third of control. The majority of the AMIA in all the animals was anti-idiotypic and wholly anti-idiotypic in the TLI animals.\r"

  ".W": "In a young girl with a severe combined immunodeficiency, the presence of circulating maternal T lymphocytes was proven by HLA typing. Manifestations of skin graft vs host disease were associated with the persistence of maternal cells. The patient received an HLA identical bone marrow transplantation from her brother without any conditioning. The bone marrow transplantation was quickly followed by a transient and dramatic increase in skin lesions associated with fever and the finding of a high number of circulating lymphocytes and eosinophils. Lymphocytes were shown to be of donor origin and exerted a spontaneous cytotoxic activity toward maternal cells. This activity progressively disappeared within 90 days, whereas maternal cells were no longer detected in patient's blood, and skin graft vs host disease was resolved within 8 wk. Cytotoxic activity was proven to be mediated by donor T lymphocytes specific for the mother's HLA antigens. The cytotoxic activity was demonstrated to be specific for the HLA class I molecules of the mother not shared with her daughter (HLA A1, B17) as shown by the use of a series of HLA typed cells as targets. In addition, cold K562 target cells did not block the cytotoxic activity, and the kinetics of the cytotoxic activity did not correlate with that of natural killer activity emergence after the bone marrow transplantation. Patient's serum did not contain antibodies toward maternal specific HLA class I antigen. Cytotoxic activity was totally blocked by anti-T3 monoclonal antibodies and partially by anti-T8 and anti-T4. It is thus likely that donor origin cytotoxic T lymphocytes were promptly activated after bone marrow transplantation and provoked the elimination of the maternal graft after a transient exacerbation of graft vs host disease manifestations. This observation represents one of the first examples of the possible role in vivo of allogeneic cytotoxic lymphocytes in humans.\r"

  ".U": "87084768\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that both bradykinin and lysylbradykinin are generated in nasal secretions upon nasal challenge of allergic individuals with appropriate allergen and have suggested that these potent pro-inflammatory peptides may contribute to the pathogenesis of the allergic response. In this study we used a variety of synthetic substrates together with both thin layer and high performance liquid chromatography systems to examine the metabolism of these peptides in nasal secretions obtained by lavage. We now demonstrate that in addition to low levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, nasal lavages contain an aminopeptidase activity that converts lysylbradykinin to bradykinin, and a carboxypeptidase that removes the C-terminal arginine from bradykinin and lysylbradykinin. The levels of all these activities are significantly increased after allergen challenge of allergic, but not nonallergic, individuals. The aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities present in post-challenge lavages from allergic individuals convert lysylbradykinin to intermediate products (bradykinin and des (Arg10) lysylbradykinin) and eventually to des (Arg9) bradykinin. The nasal carboxypeptidase was activated 475% by 0.1 mM CoCl2 and was inhibited by the carboxypeptidase N inhibitor, MERGETPA (D-L-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropanoic acid) (IC50 = 10 microM). The aminopeptidase activity was not affected by MERGETPA but was potently inhibited by amastatin and bestatin (IC50 = 0.05 microM and 3.0 microM, respectively). The activity of the aminopeptidase against its synthetic substrate was also inhibited by lysylbradykinin (IC50 = 50 microM). Both the carboxypeptidase and aminopeptidase activities had neutral pH optima and were inhibited by o-phenanthroline, but were unaffected by inhibitors of neutral endopeptidases (phosphoramidon) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (Captopril). The Km of bradykinin for the nasal carboxypeptidase was 139 +/- 14 microM (n = 3). We conclude that during the allergic response, nasal secretions contain aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities that convert lysylbradykinin and bradykinin (B2 agonists) to des (Arg9) bradykinin (a B1 agonist). Because the nature of the kinin receptors in the nasal mucosa are currently unknown, it remains to be determined whether this metabolism results in the termination of biologic activity or the production of a biologically active moiety.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of antigen-specific T lymphocyte lines requires presentation of the relevant antigen by syngeneic accessory cells (AC) that express Class II MHC gene products. To determine if the T cell activation signal was AC associated or was shed into the medium, supernatants from rat thymic AC populations pulsed with guinea pig basic protein (GP-BP) or PPD were used to stimulate resting BP- or PPD-reactive T cell lines derived from Lewis or BN rats. Cellfree supernatants were found to stimulate the T cell lines in an antigen-specific, strain-restricted manner, reflecting the pattern of stimulation observed with intact AC used. The activity of the cellfree supernatant could be enhanced five to 20 times in the presence of activated T lymphocytes, the optimal production occurring over a 6-hr period. The cellfree T lymphocyte activation signal produced in the presence of activated T cell products contained both an antigen-specific, MHC-restricted component (85%) and an antigen-independent, mitogenic component (15%). Supernatants containing GP-BP but not bovine BP or PPD induced highly significant proliferation of the Lewis rat-derived BP-1 T lymphocyte line, and transfer of these supernatant-activated cells produced clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and DTH reactions to GP-BP. The GP-BP component was not inhibited by either of two monoclonal antibodies directed at determinants on either side of the epitope(s) recognized by BP-1 cells. However, stimulation was inhibited by an anti-I-A but not an anti-I-E monoclonal antibody, suggesting the involvement of a Class II MHC gene product on the T cell activation signal. The supernatant activity could be separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 X G for 4 hr into a microsomal pellet and an ultrasupernatant, and both fractions had greatly reduced activity on resting T cells until they were reconstituted by vigorous mixing. These results suggest that T effector cells can be activated by AC-derived microsomal fragments bearing Class II antigens that associate noncovalently with processed antigen. This cellfree signal is sufficient to activate encephalitogenic T lymphocytes to transfer clinical EAE and DTH reactions without need for a direct T cell-AC interaction.\r"

We and other investigators have shown that DAF is part of a newly characterized family of proteins that are anchored to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol (PI). The group includes the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of African trypanosomes, the p63 protein of Leishmania, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), alkaline phosphatase, Thy-1, 5'-nucleotidase, and RT6.2--an alloantigen from rat T cells. The structure of the membrane anchor has been best characterized for VSG, but chemical studies of the membrane anchors of AChE and Thy-1 suggest that similar glycolipid moieties anchor these proteins to the cell surface. In the VSG, the membrane anchor consists of an ethanolamine linked covalently to an oligosaccharide and glucosamine; the entire complex is anchored to the cell membrane by PI. Immunologically, this glycolipid defines an epitope, the cross-reacting determinant (CRD), that is only revealed after removal of the diacyl glycerol anchor by a phospholipase C. By Western blotting, we show here that DAF-S (DAF released from the membrane by PI-specific phospholipase C [PIPLC]) also contains CRD. Using a newly developed immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) in which the solid-phase capturing antibody is a monoclonal antibody to DAF and the second antibody is anti-CRD, we have been able to quantitate DAF-S. By IRMA, we show that the reaction between anti-CRD and DAF-S is specific, since the binding is competitively inhibited only by the soluble form of the VSG. These observations further support the concept that the glycolipid anchors of this new family of proteins have similar structures. DAF is also found as a soluble protein in various tissue fluids as well as in Hela cell supernatants. No evidence for the presence of the CRD epitope was found on these proteins, suggesting that these forms of DAF are not released from the surface of cells by endogenous phospholipases.\r"

This specific immunologic defect is thought to contribute to the aggressive clinical course that typifies patients with LL. We report that although fresh CD4+ (helper) T cells from most LL patients are specifically unresponsive to M. leprae, after culture in medium alone for 48 hr the same cells respond to M. leprae antigens. The recovery of T cell function is specific for M. leprae, occurs at the level of responder CD4+ T cells, and is not affected by monocytes or CD8+ (suppressor) T cells. Recovery of T cell reactivity is blocked by the presence of M. leprae bacilli in the preculture medium. These findings indicate that despite the apparent specific anergy seen in patients with LL, the T cells of most LL patients can respond to M. leprae. Their failure to do so, in vivo, may be due to the persistence of antigen, which renders antigen-reactive T cells nonresponsive either directly or via activation of CD4+ suppressor cells.\r"

The specificities of MAb were determined by dot blot assay by using viable elementary bodies of 13 C. trachomatis serovars and two C. psittaci strains. The dot blot assay was used to identify those antigens that were unique and immunoaccessible on the chlamydial surface. MAb were identified that recognized bi-specific (serovars B and Ba) or subspecies-specific (various B complex serovars) surface-exposed antigenic determinants that were either resistant or sensitive to heat denaturation (56 degrees C, 30 min). All of the MAb recognized the major outer membrane protein as determined by either immunoblotting or radioimmunoprecipitation. MAb specific for immunoaccessible major outer membrane protein epitopes protected mice from toxic death after i.v. injection of B serovar elementary bodies and neutralized the infectivity of the organism for monkey eyes. In contrast, MAb reactive against non-immunoaccessible subspecies- or species-specific major outer membrane protein epitopes or against an immunoaccessible genus-specific epitope located on chlamydial lipopolysaccharide did not protect mice from toxic death or neutralize infectivity of the parasite for monkey eyes. These data suggest that those major outer membrane protein antigenic determinants that are serovar or serogroup specific and are accessible to antibody on the chlamydial cell surface may be useful as a recombinant subunit vaccine for trachoma.\r"

  ".U": "87084795\r", 
  ".W": "It is well-established that activated T cells proliferate in response to interleukin 2 (IL 2) and produce various soluble lymphokines such as macrophage-activating factor (MAF) in response to antigen. Prior to investigating the molecular events involved in signaling the initiation of these responses in cloned murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), we determined whether these responses could occur independently, and we established for each response the time during which signal transducing mechanisms may function. It was found that this cloned CTL population was in a resting state (G1 phase of cell cycle) 7 days after stimulation with antigen plus IL 2. At this time, the incubation of these resting CTL with IL 2 for 4 to 6 hr resulted in a maximal proliferative response that was not accompanied by the production of MAF. Conversely, the incubation of resting CTL with antigen or lectin (in the absence of IL 2) for at least 8 hr resulted in the maximal production of MAF at 24 hr without inducing a proliferative response. In addition, antigen or lectin, but not IL 2, triggered an immediate (less than 1 min) and sustained (at least 8 hr) mobilization of intracellular calcium. The kinetics of this calcium response paralleled the minimum time (8 hr) that was required for resting CTL to interact with either antigen or lectin in order to produce maximal titers of MAF. These results indicate that proliferation and lymphokine (MAF) production in cloned murine CTL are independent events. In these resting CTL, the signal mechanisms that mediate the production of lymphokines are most likely restricted to the initial 8 hr of stimulation by antigen or lectin and involve the rapid and prolonged mobilization of cytoplasmic calcium. Proliferative signals, however, are probably complete within 4 to 6 hr after stimulation by IL 2 and do not involve readily demonstrable fluxes of cytoplasmic calcium, as determined by the fluorescent calcium probe Quin 2.\r"

  ".W": "The phospholipid metabolism of cloned murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) was examined under conditions in which the induction of proliferation by interleukin 2 (IL 2) and the stimulated production of lymphokine (macrophage-activating factor (MAF] by concanavalin A (Con A) and specific antigen occurred independently of each other. Activation of the CTL by either of the latter two stimuli resulted in changes in the metabolism of phosphatidylinositol (PI) that were early (less than 2.5 min), specific, and prolonged (6 to 8 hr). These changes were primarily characterized by an increase in phosphatidic acid (PA) and PI, with a decrease in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. The duration of these phospholipid responses, particularly PA and PI, approximated the minimum time of CTL-stimulus interaction required to produce maximal titers of MAF. No changes were observed in other major classes of phospholipids during 8 hr of continuous stimulation. Stimulation with an irrelevant antigen had no effect on CTL phospholipid metabolism. In contrast to specific antigen or Con A, the T cell growth factor IL 2 failed to elicit specific and early biosynthetic responses from PA and PI. Instead, there were nonspecific biosynthetic responses from all major phospholipid classes (including phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, as well as PA and PI) which occurred between 1 and 6 hr after IL 2 stimulation. Both 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol phosphates (IP), the hydrolytic products of PI turnover, were produced in response to MAF-inducing stimuli, but neither were detected in response to the proliferative stimulus IL 2. Together, these results indicate that the hydrolysis of PI and the concomitant production of the putative second messengers DAG and IP are involved in signaling the production of lymphokines (MAF) by CTL. On the other hand, the failure of IL 2 to elicit a full-spectrum PI response suggests that signals mediating CTL proliferation may utilize an alternate and still undefined pathway.\r"

At different times, the incorporated BrdU as well as the human epidermal LC were revealed on skin sections using anti-BrdU and OKT-6 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. After 6 h, 4.9% of the LC were labeled with BrdU. Then, the number of OKT-6(+) BrdU(+) cells increased in a linear manner and achieved 34% at 120 h, 67% at 240 h, and 94% at 400 h during the course of continuous labeling procedures. Based on this result we calculated a total cell cycle time of 392 h (16.3 days) and 12 h for the S-phase for human epidermal LC. Applying this technique, we were able to show also that 48 h after local treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or after stripping, the number of BrdU-labeled LC was considerably increased. Furthermore, after i.p. injection of colchicine in the nude mouse, human epidermal LC undergoing mitosis were evidenced by electron microscopy in the graft. From these results we conclude that the LC are actively cycling--therewith a self-reproducing cell population in human epidermis.\r"

  ".W": "This paper presents a study of autoantibodies (autoAB) to keratins and to epidermis by a double approach associating a specific immunoenzymatic technique and immunofluorescence. The existence of natural autoAB to keratins in all normal human sera was asserted and the heterogeneity of natural autoAB to the epidermis explored. By a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we detected natural IgM and IgG autoAB to keratin polypeptides extracted from human plantar stratum corneum (SC) in 60 randomly selected normal human sera. The interindividual variation factors of their titers were about 100X in IgM and 50X in IgG antikeratin (AK) autoAB. The IgM and IgG AK autoAB titers varied independently. By a semiquantitative indirect immunofluorescence assay we detected in these sera IgM and IgG autoAB that labeled normal epidermis according to various morphologic patterns. The IgG autoAB labeled SC and suprabasal layers (SBL) in 57.4% of sera, SC in 20.4% and SBL in 7.4%. The IgM autoAB labeled SC and SBL in 52% of sera, SC in 24%, SC and SBL plus basal layer (BL) in 18%, and SBL in 2%. Like the titers, the patterns of IgM and IgG autoAB to epidermis were found to be unrelated. The IgG AK autoAB titers were found to significantly correlate only with the IgG autoAB directed to SC + SBL; the IgM AK autoAB titers only with the IgM autoAB directed to SC + SBL + BL. This showed that these patterns of labeling are typical for AK autoAB and that autoAB to SC, which could not be related to AK autoAB, exist in some normal sera. Antikeratin and antiepidermis IgM autoAB titers were found to be strongly correlated to total amounts of IgM assayed by radial immunodiffusion, indicating that the synthesis of these natural IgM autoAB vary in the same way as that of general IgM synthesis. For the AK and antiepidermis IgG autoAB, however, the same correlation to total serum IgG was found to be much weaker.\r"

At the level of antigenic activity selected as the cutoff value, the sensitivity of the RIA was 74%, the specificity 90%, the positive predictive value 82%, and the negative predictive value 85%. Antigen was detected before invasive aspergillosis was suspected during 30% of admissions and before pathological or even preliminary microbiological evidence for disease in 46%. In 17 (77%) of the 22 episodes of pulmonary aspergillosis, the RIA would have been the first positive diagnostic test for aspergillosis or would have confirmed a diagnosis established by other means. Overall, the test would have been of clinical usefulness in diagnosis, management, and prognosis in 80% of 16 fatal cases.\r"

Immunoblot of CSF demonstrated that antibodies to HSV-specific polypeptides, particularly to glycoprotein B, were present in a matched serum specimen. When purified glycoprotein B was used to detect CSF antibodies, 34 of 35 specimens from biopsy-proven patients were reactive (97% sensitivity) compared with only six of 22 specimens obtained from biopsy-negative patients (73% specificity). If leakage of antibodies to a marker virus (adenovirus) was determined and controlled, the specificity increased to 100%.

The four groups exhibited no statistically significant differences in occurrence of symptoms after each dose, and rises in titers of vibriocidal (VC) antibodies to Inaba and Ogawa were twofold higher for vaccinees than for controls (P less than .001). Half of the persons with fourfold or greater VC responses to WC responded after the first dose; many additional patients, particularly young children, responded after subsequent doses. In contrast, 89% of persons who responded to BS-WC with twofold or greater rises in titer of IgG antibodies to cholera toxin did so after the first dose. After the third dose, vaccinees exhibited a fivefold higher rise in titer than did controls (P less than .001); a dose-to-dose booster effect was most evident in young children.\r"

Clinical response to therapy occurred in 188 (80%) patients. Elevated maximal and mean peak aminoglycoside concentration/MIC ratios were strongly associated with clinical response (P less than .00001 and P less than .0001, respectively). A graded dose-response effect was found between an increasing maximal peak concentration/MIC ratio and clinical response. By logistic regression the peak concentration/MIC ratios were associated significantly with clinical response after adjustment for underlying severity of illness and other factors correlated with response. These results demonstrate that a high peak concentration relative to the MIC for the infecting organism is a major determinant of the clinical response to aminoglycoside therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effectiveness of two techniques involving the use of the enzyme trypsin to activate inactive renin in human plasma. Both these methods were developed to optimize activation with trypsin by preventing the possible destruction of activated renin by trypsin itself. In one method, an antitryptic agent such as benzamidine is added to plasma, concomitantly with trypsin (liquid phase). In the other a low concentration of Sepharose-bound (immobilized) trypsin is used. In six plasma samples we have found that trypsin (1.5 mg/ml) activation, with or without benzamidine (0.8 mg/ml), yielded similar values of activated renin (11.0 +/- 2.7 vs. 11.3 +/- 2.3 ng/ml/hr). However, the addition of immobilized trypsin to pool plasma pretreated with trypsin plus benzamidine caused a further increase in plasma renin activity (PRA); in contrast, the addition of trypsin and benzamidine to pool plasma pretreated with immobilized trypsin caused a decrease in PRA. In 17 plasma samples from patients with essential hypertension we found that the inactive renin values were always higher after treatment with immobilized trypsin than with trypsin plus benzamidine (9.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 6.1 +/- 0.5 ng/ml/hr, P less than 0.01); moreover, there was a positive correlation between the differences in the values of inactive renin measured with the two methods and the values obtained with immobilized trypsin (r = 0.64, P less than 0.01). Therefore, the activation with immobilized trypsin is more effective than that with liquid-phase trypsin, alone or in combination with benzamidine, in converting inactive renin in human plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In several diseases, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, fibrin-fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) can be detected when serum is used. To avoid the use of serum with the risk of falsely positive and negative results, and to quantitatively measure routinely low levels of FDP in plasma, we developed a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay (EIA), using a monoclonal antibody (No. FDP-14). It reacts specifically with FDP, but not with the parent fibrinogen-fibrin molecule. To raise the monoclonal antibodies we injected into mice a whole mixture of fibrin degradation products isolated after complete lysis of a human blood clot by tissue-type plasminogen activator, because there is a chance that such products resemble FDP in patients' blood more closely than antigens derived from purified fibrinogen. The EIA developed is a two-step assay (\"cap-tag procedure\"), in which the monoclonal antibody is attached to the wells of microtiter plates. The monoclonal antibody is specific for a neoantigenic determinant in the fragment E moiety, exposed after degradation of fibrinogen-fibrin by plasmin. The assay discriminates neither between degradation products of fibrinogen and fibrin nor between fibrin degradation products that are or are not cross-linked. It is not disturbed by the presence of fibrinogen or fibrin monomer in plasma. The assay is accurate above 60 ng FDP per milliliter and has a detection limit down to approximately 10 ng FDP per milliliter when the supernatant of a lysed blood clot is used as calibration material. In frozen, then thawed plasma specimens from normal individuals, FDP values varied between 30 and 110 ng/ml. Plasma of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation and of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy had increased FDP values. In patients with ovarian carcinoma, FDP concentrations in plasma varied with the clinical course of the disease. Results indicate that the EIA for FDP in plasma is promising as a diagnostic tool in different clinical situations.\r"

In general, they reliably calculate heart rate, intervals, and mean QRS axis. When the computer interprets an ECG as normal, it is usually correct. The second opinion provided by computerized readings further benefits the primary care physician by suggesting findings not initially considered, and by forcing careful scrutiny of the original interpretation. Speed of interpretation may be greatly increased, particularly for the more experienced electrocardiographer who has a high volume of tracings to interpret. Each computer statement, however, must be carefully overread by the physician, for failure to do so may result in overlooking significant electrocardiographic findings. It is important that the family physician appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of computerized ECG interpretations so that he or she derives the greatest benefit from this diagnostic tool.\r"

It can occur singly or be manifested in combination with other psychosexual disorders. Diagnosis of dyspareunia is appropriate in cases in which the experience of pain is persistent and severe. There has been little agreement concerning the origin of dyspareunia. Organic conditions and psychological variables have alternately been presented as major factors in causality. There is a presumed high incidence of physical disease associated with dyspareunia when compared with other female sexual dysfunctions. In the majority of cases, however, organic factors are thought to be rare in contrast with sexual issues and interpersonal or intrapsychic difficulties as a cause of continuing problems. The finding of an organic basis for dyspareunia does not rule out emotional or psychogenic causes. Thorough and extensive gynecologic and psychological evaluation is essential in cases of dyspareunia. The etiology of dyspareunia should be viewed on a continuum from primarily physical to primarily psychological with many women falling in the middle area.\r"

Lactate dehydrogenase was the next most useful marker. Both beta 2-microglobulin and carcinoembryonic antigen had a sensitivity of 60%.

After 21 to 28 days in culture, aggregates were infected with MCMV and studied sequentially for 14 days using virus assay, electron microscopy and indirect immunofluorescence. Infectious virus could be recovered from aggregate cultures beginning three days after infection, and peak virus titers were observed on day 7 in aggregate tissues and on day 14 in culture fluids. By transmission electron microscopy, intranuclear viral nucleocapsids were identified in neural cells at the periphery of the aggregates on day 3. Infection then spread centripetally into aggregate tissues so that by day 14 the majority of neural cells contained intranuclear inclusions, numerous nucleocapsids, and mature virus particles. Virion production in neural cells was the result of a sequence of events that included budding of nucleocapsids from the nucleus and envelopment of cytoplasmic virus particles by membranes of the Golgi apparatus. These studies indicate that MCMV infection of murine brain aggregate cultures is a potentially useful in vitro system for the study of CMV infections of neural tissue.\r"

Treatment with this antiserum produced a 10-fold increase in the area of remyelination in spinal cords that had become demyelinated previously as a result of infection by Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Inflammation was decreased in regions of white matter that showed remyelination. Oligodendrocytes exposed to anti-SCH in vitro incorporated three to five times more [3H]thymidine than resting cells did and expressed more myelin basic protein in their cytoplasm, suggesting stimulation of myelinogenesis. Thus, there is a factor present in anti-SCH antiserum that stimulates central nervous system-type remyelination. This finding may provide clues for the therapy of patients with demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis.\r"

The appropriate use and relative role of these imaging modalities in the investigation of patients with thyroid and parathyroid diseases is discussed.\r"

For the past decade many investigators have focused their research on the role that regulatory peptides play in eating behavior. Many peptides, including cholecystokinin, bombesin, calcitonin, corticotropin-releasing factor, neurotensin and somatostatin, have been reported to decrease the amount of food ingested by laboratory animals. In contrast, a relatively small number of peptides increase food intake. The present review describes the effects of these peptides on consummatory behaviors in various species and their sites of action.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of protein ingestion on liver albumin synthesis and albumin content was investigated in rats fed protein as a meal (90% casein) given apart from the other dietary components provided ad libitum. In this condition, protein ingestion rapidly stimulates liver total protein synthesis. Separately fed rats were studied 6 and 20 h after the protein meal. Control rats fed mixed diets containing 13 or 80% casein were killed either during the absorptive (night) or postabsorptive (light) periods. The ratio of hepatic albumin synthesis to total protein synthesis remained fairly constant (12-15%) in all groups, indicating that albumin synthesis paralleled total protein synthesis. Liver albumin content measured in microsomes by immunonephelometry was significantly higher in separately fed rats killed 6 h postmeal than in those killed after 20 h. In rats fed 13% casein, the liver albumin content remained high regardless of the time of killing. In rats fed 80% casein, the albumin content was higher during the absorptive period than during the postabsorptive period. Immunoperoxidase staining of the hepatocyte organelles involved in albumin synthesis, especially the Golgi apparatus, was more intense for separately fed rats killed 6 h postmeal than for those killed after 20 h. Livers of rats fed 13% casein also exhibited a pattern indicative of high hepatocyte albumin content, whereas livers of rats fed 80% casein contained less. These results show that, in separate feeding, wide circadian variations of albumin synthesis run parallel to changes in liver albumin content.\r"

Since hypokalemia is not specific for aldosteronism, the authors assessed its use and limitations as a screening test in nine reported studies of 303 patients with aldosterone-producing adenomas (n = 252) or adrenal hyperplasia (n = 51). The optimal potassium cutoff level and the predictive ability of hypokalemia to detect aldosteronism were analyzed in a primary care setting with different diseases, test characteristics, and prevalences. Optimal screening for primary aldosteronism occurred at serum potassium less than 3.2 mEq/l in a primary care, low-prevalence population, and at higher potassium levels in higher-prevalence populations. Other screening tests, such as urinary aldosterone levels and plasma renin activity, showed lower individual test performance characteristics, but when combined were similar in performance to serum potassium measurement.\r"

Overall, the patients' acceptance of the procedure and their perception of the outcome was favorable.\r"

Bone grafts irradiated after placement were tolerant of irradiation. Bone grafts irradiated after four weeks were found to be less affected by irradiation than those irradiated within the first four weeks, forming an ossicle structurally and histologically superior to that of bone ossicles developed from grafts placed into irradiated tissues.\r"

The relationship between DLIS presence or concentration and age, weight, gender, race, and serum creatinine was investigated. Twenty-seven percent of patients had a positive apparent DLIS concentration (greater than or equal to 0.2 ng/ml). The mean +/- SD concentration of DLIS in the positive group was 0.39 +/- 0.18 ng/ml (range 0.2 to 1.37 ng/ml). Patients in the DLIS-positive group were younger than those in the negative group (P less than 0.01). Although a greater percentage of infants younger than 6 months of age had measurable DLIS, the mean DLIS concentrations, when present, were not significantly different for all age groups (P greater than 0.05). No significant relationship was found between race or gender and DLIS. A weakly positive correlation between serum creatinine concentration and DLIS was noted (r = 0.22, P less than 0.03), but elevated serum creatinine measurements (greater than 0.6 mg/dL) did not correlate with DLIS concentration. These results support the hypothesis that the presence of DLIS is age related, but DLIS appears to be present in a much larger and older population of pediatric patients than previously reported.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study, 36 (35%) of 103 patients had early recurrence of acute otitis media. We wished to identify risk factors for early recurrences (those recurring within 1 month of initial diagnosis) and to determine if the second episode was caused by the same pathogen (relapse) or a new organism (reinfection). When the same bacterial species was recovered in both episodes, Streptococcus pneumoniae were serotyped and Haemophilus influenzae were classified by biotypes and by electrophoretic pattern of the outer membrane proteins. Twenty-nine patients underwent tympanocentesis at the time of the recurrent episode. In 13, no pathogen was recovered either initially or at the time of recurrence. Twelve (75%) of the remaining 16 patients had reinfection; only four (25%) had relapse. Thus, early recurrences of acute otitis media were more often caused by a new organism. This finding suggests that underlying susceptibility to middle ear infection is important in the development of recurrent otitis media. Pediatricians should not assume that early recurrences are necessarily the result of failure of initial treatment. Tympanocentesis may be helpful in this setting to aid in choosing appropriate antibiotic therapy.\r"

An attending pediatrician performed the observation using the previously reported Acute Illness Observation Scales (AIOS). Subsequently, the history and physical examination were done by an attending pediatrician, and findings were scored as to whether they suggested the presence of a serious illness. Thirty-six patients, 28 in the PCC-ER and eight in the private practice, had a serious illness. The combined AIOS, history, and physical examination had a higher sensitivity and r correlation for serious illness than did the traditional history and physical examination. Three children with serious illnesses, all of whom had no abnormalities on history and physical examination, were identified only by use of AIOS. We conclude that assessment of appearance in a child with fever, when performed in a careful, integrated, stepwise fashion, improves the sensitivity of the history and physical examination in detecting serious illnesses in febrile children.\r"

Forty-five cases of GBS disease occurred in infants, 24 \"early-onset\" disease and 21 \"late-onset\" disease. The combined attack rate for early and late disease was 3.3 per 1000 live births over the 6 years. The rate of early-onset disease was highest in infants found to be heavily colonized at birth: 50 per 1000 live births. Twenty-three of 24 had evidence of intrauterine-acquired infection. All GBS serotypes were represented. Preterm delivery, prolonged labor, premature rupture of membranes, and maternal infection enhanced the risk of early disease. Septicemia was the predominant form of late-onset disease (15 of 21 cases); GBS type III accounted for 19 of 21 cases. Ten of 21 infants with late infections were colonized at birth with the GBS type that subsequently caused disease. Thus a maternal source of infection was identified in 34 of the 45 infants. These data reveal consistent year-to-year carriage and disease rates in the study population.\r"

Four (14%) of 28 patients with catheterization had worsening renal function or anatomic appearance by intravenous pyelogram, and required a diversion. Three (28%) of 14 patients with diversion had changes in renal structure or function. Eight of 31 patients from both groups studied with voiding cystourethrography before the onset of therapy had small, noncompliant, trabeculated bladders; all seven patients who had worsening in function or anatomic appearance were from this subset (P less than 0.01). None of the patients with flaccid or distensible bladders demonstrated these changes. Renal disease was unrelated to the level of neurologic function.

  ".W": "Folic acid (FA) and 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid (FTHF) have been shown previously to produce a marked stimulation of locomotor activity after bilateral injection into the rat nucleus accumbens. This study was designed to determine whether the hypermotility response produced by the folates is mediated through the activation of excitatory amino acid receptors in the nucleus accumbens. Although FA stimulated locomotor activity, pteroic acid, a congener of FA that lacks the glutamate moiety, was ineffective, suggesting that the glutamate portion of the molecule is essential for the hypermotility response. The N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists, D-alpha-aminoadipic acid, DL-alpha-epsilon-diaminopimelic acid and MgCl2, at doses that attenuated NMDA-induced hypermotility, were ineffective in decreasing the folate-induced hypermotility response. This behavioral observation is consistent with the biochemical observation that the folates, at a 1 mM concentration, were unable to stimulate the release of [3H]acetylcholine from striatal slices, a model system that is sensitive to the activation of NMDA receptors. In contrast to the ineffectiveness of the NMDA antagonists in inhibiting the response to the folates, the antagonist, glutamic acid diethylester, which inhibited the response to quisqualic acid, but not NMDA, also inhibited the response to both FA and FTHF. Two recently characterized dipeptides, gamma-D-glutamylaminomethylsulfonic acid and gamma-D-glutamyltaurine, antagonized the stimulation of locomotor activity produced by quisqualic acid, FA and FTHF. However, these dipeptides also inhibited the response to NMDA, suggesting that these compounds are not able to distinguish between quisqualate and NMDA receptors in the nucleus accumbens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Neurochemical and circulatory effects of fenoldopam were studied in pithed rabbits with electrically stimulated sympathetic outflow and in strips of the rabbit pulmonary artery. In pithed rabbits, fenoldopam (1-30 micrograms/kg/min) decreased the arterial blood pressure. Fenoldopam (3-30 microgram/kg/min) also increased the norepinephrine spillover rate (the rate at which endogenous norepinephrine enters into the plasma after having been released from postganglionic sympathetic nerves) and decreased the [3H]norepinephrine plasma clearance. The selective dopamine (DA)1 antagonist SCH 23390 (bolus injection of 10 micrograms/kg followed by infusion of 2 micrograms/kg/hr) antagonized markedly and the DA2-selective antagonist domperidone (bolus injection of 200 micrograms/kg followed by infusion of 50 micrograms/kg/hr) antagonized slightly the hypotensive effect. The increase in the norepinephrine spillover rate was enhanced after treatment with desipramine. Clonidine (0.3 microgram/kg/min) reduced the spillover of norepinephrine, and this effect was abolished by fenoldopam (30 micrograms/kg/min). In pulmonary artery strips preincubated with [3H]norepinephrine, fenoldopam (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) increased the electrically evoked overflow of tritium. The effect of fenoldopam (10(-6) M) was prevented in the presence of a supramaximal concentration of clonidine (10(-5) M). The results suggest that fenoldopam lowers blood pressure mainly by activation of vascular smooth muscle DA1 receptors. In addition, however, it blocks prejunctional alpha-2 autoreceptors at postganglionic sympathetic axons.\r"

THC (2.5 mg/kg/d) or vehicle was administered during different periods of gestation, and effects on pregnancy outcome and hormone concentrations during pregnancy were studied. The most obvious effects were observed with administration early in pregnancy; three of five pregnancies aborted within days after the drug injections began, and one pregnancy resulted in a stillbirth at term. The three abortions were associated with a rapid decrease in chorionic gonadotropin and a subsequent fall in progesterone concentrations to nondetectable levels. In the two pregnancies that continued until term, estradiol concentrations were significantly higher than in vehicle control pregnancies. Daily THC administration during the middle or third portion of gestation resulted in lesser pregnancy loss (one premature birth and four live births at term with THC treatment during the middle portion; two premature births and three live births at term with THC treatment during the third portion). All the premature infants died within two weeks of birth. The weights of the infants at birth and weaning were not significantly different for the infants from vehicle control pregnancies and for full-term infants exposed to THC during gestation. Also, no effects on intrauterine growth and development were detected with ultrasound in the drug-treated pregnancies. With acute administration, THC readily crossed the placenta at term in rhesus monkeys and was transferred into the milk of nursing mothers. Significant blood levels of THC and depressant effects were observed in both mothers and neonates when the drug was administered to the mothers one hour before birth or during lactation.\r"

The data are inconclusive in establishing that women who used the relatively higher-dose pills prescribed in the 1960s have a higher risk of either thrombotic or hemorrhagic stroke. Furthermore, a review of the literature does not support the belief that those women who use oral contraceptives have a higher incidence of migraine headache. The available data do not indicate that migraine headache is necessarily a contraindication to prescribing oral contraceptives.\r"

One approach to addressing this problem is to train physicians to address the emotional concerns that patients experience as a result of their medical problems. Results of the authors' randomized, controlled experiment in training medical students to respond to patients' emotional concerns provide evidence of the efficacy and feasibility of such training. Only students who received small-group instruction in addition to large-group lectures exhibited statistically significant (p less than .001) improvement in their ability to respond to the emotional concerns of patients in hypothetical cases. The students who received only the lectures exhibited significant improvement (p less than .001) in their preference for responses that addressed patients' emotional concerns but not in their responses to written, hypothetical patient cases. Even though these students' preferences for responses to emotional concerns on the average did increase significantly, the preferences were significantly (p less than .001) less favorable than the preferences of the students who received small-group instruction. The small group instruction consisted of both interviews with elderly nursing home residents, who served as simulated patients, and structured practice and review sessions.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and to develop surface coils for assessing cadaveric renal viability during hypothermic storage, we used the monophosphate/inorganic phosphate ratio (MP/Pi) to monitor phosphorous metabolites in intact kidneys during various renal preservation maneuvers. Eighteen canine kidneys and 16 cadaveric kidneys were studied as follows: Group 1 (N = 4) in situ kidneys were monitored by implanted MRS coils; Group 1 (N = 4) ex vivo kidneys were immediately attached to vascular cannulas and monitored by MRS surface coils during normothermic perfusion; Group 3 (N = 4) kidneys were removed, cold-flushed and, after 24 hours of 4C storage, monitored by MRS surface coils before and during four hours of reperfusion via vascular cannulas; Group 4 (N = 6) kidneys were removed, cold-flushed and monitored by surface coils during cold storage up to 72 hours. In addition, 16 cadaveric kidneys were studied while in sterile cold-storage containers. Postoperative renal function was followed in recipient patients. The MP/Pi ratios in Group 1 kidneys correlated with the ability to regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Groups 2 and 3 showed similar regeneration of ATP and MP/Pi after postischemic reperfusion, and the signal-to-noise ratios of the surface coils were better than those in the implanted coils in Group 1. Surface-coil monitoring in Group 4 kidneys showed predictable decay rates of MP/Pi during one to 72 hours of cold storage; in contrast, simultaneous cortical medullary microcirculation studies with 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin were inconclusive. Human cadaveric kidneys with high MP levels were associated with excellent renal function after transplantation, while those with low MP (less than or equal to 0.50) were associated with nonviability. We conclude that MRS is a practical and safe diagnostic modality for clinical transplantation.\r"

Positive staining was seen on tubular epithelial cells of the kidney. Thus, the antigen recognized by mAb K2.7 appeared to be an interspecies kidney specific antigen. Results obtained by protein A (PA) assays with a cultured cell panel were consistent with those of staining and confirmed the restricted expression of the antigen. Immunochemical analysis revealed that mAb K2.7 reacted with molecules of 63,000, 60,000 and 43,000 daltons.\r"

We have evaluated 16 patients for presumed HIPA because of the occurrence of thrombocytopenia or a new thrombotic complication during heparin therapy. In this group, 16 thrombotic events occurred in 10 patients with a mortality rate of 18.8%. Diagnosis was confirmed in vitro by the demonstration of at least 20% platelet aggregation and/or 6% 14C-serotonin release after heparin (0.1 to 3 U/ml) was added to a mixture of patient platelet-poor plasma (PPP, two parts) and aspirin-free donor platelet-rich plasma (PRP, three parts). After heparin was discontinued, seven patients continued to have HIPA in their own PRP although it could no longer be observed in donor PRP. Iloprost, a potent prostacyclin analog that reversibly inhibits platelet activation, completely prevented HIPA and release in all of nine patients. Aspirin, an irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor, failed to prevent HIPA in four of these nine patients. In conclusion, HIPA is associated with an extremely high morbidity and mortality rate. Evaluation of the patients' PRP in response to heparin may improve the diagnostic sensitivity of this assay. Aspirin does not reliably prevent HIPA, which suggests participation of thromboxane-independent pathways. Thus, if further exposure to heparin is unavoidable, a more effective platelet inhibitor such as iloprost is required to reliably prevent in vivo HIPA.\r"

This prospective payment system features local administration and control and is the first time a group of hospitals have committed themselves to a comprehensive regional financing system. This system differs from other prospective payment programs in that it covers both inpatient and outpatient care and offers incentives for ambulatory treatment whenever clinically appropriate. In the first five years of this program, the increase in Rochester area hospital expenses was 46%, compared with 52% for New York State hospitals and 68% for US hospitals at large. Further, the financial position of the Rochester hospitals improved, showing an operating margin of 2.6%, compared with a figure of-15.8% for New York State hospitals at large. A community-wide assessment showed no evidence of a reduction in the quality of or access to care. This community system for hospital payment and planning merits serious consideration for areas wishing to realize high-quality care at an affordable cost through a balanced combination of self-regulation, cooperation, and competition.\r"

This report contrasts those aged 65 years and older with younger patients. Detection and management of mental morbidity were lower for older individuals, but the feedback intervention increased the likelihood of attention to these problems. This was not true for younger patients. Detection was significantly higher for older patients when screening data were made available, as was management, although the latter difference was not statistically significant. There was evidence as well that the intervention moved clinicians to greater congruence with their older patients in the perception that current mental health problems existed. These findings have important implications for primary care.\r"

Thirty-seven percent of all resident beneficiaries enrolled. Aggregate losses exceeded $3 million (11.6% of revenue). Management implemented increasingly more stringent utilization review. Overall hospital utilization declined 261.7 days per 1000 from fiscal year 1981 to 1982; nonetheless, federal reimbursement was insufficient to meet program costs and the demonstration was terminated. The central reimbursement method used in Medicare risk contracting (adjusted average per capita cost) does not adequately control for enrollment selection, unmet medical need, or recent regional cost variations. Reimbursement set at 95% of estimated fee-for-service costs does not recognize, and in the long run will not support, an efficiently operating delivery system.\r"

  ".W": "A possible mechanism to regulate body weight during a high calorie intake may be an increased metabolic rate in skeletal muscle. To approach this hypothesis the energy metabolites, ATP, phosphocreatine, creatine, glycogen and lactate were measured in biopsies from the quadriceps femoris muscle. Concomitantly the function of the adductor pollicis muscle was studied as assessed after electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve. The muscle function variables were, force of contraction at 5, 10, 20, and 50 Hz of stimulation, relaxation rate, and endurance. Eight obese women were studied before gastroplastic surgery and 6 months postoperatively and a weight loss of 19.4 +/- 3.4% (mean +/- SEM). Preoperatively ATP, phosphocreatine, glycogen, and lactate were significantly decreased and the same pattern was found postoperatively. These findings can be related to a low production of energy-rich phosphates or a high energy utilization. Both pre- and postoperatively there was, a decreased force of contraction at 10 Hz of stimulation (p less than 0.001), a faster relaxation rate (p less than 0.01) and a normal endurance. These functional results indicate a high metabolic rate. At admission a decreased serum insulin level indicated a moderate insulin resistance which was normalized after the weight loss. The triiodothyronine concentration was normal before and after operation. In conclusion our findings of changed muscle energy metabolite concentrations and altered muscle function indicate a high metabolic rate in skeletal muscle in obese women. This may be an adaptation in skeletal muscle energy metabolism to a high body weight.\r"

  ".W": "Sera of patients with breast cancer (as well as control normal sera and sera of patients with ovarian cancer or melanoma) were screened for the presence of antibodies against antigens expressed by the MDA breast cancer cell line. The techniques employed were radioimmunoassay with radioiodinated protein A and immunodotting with peroxidase-conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies. Sera reacting strongly by immunodotting were subsequently tested against antigens of the MDA and T47D cell lines in immunoblotting experiments. Both the breast cancer and the control sera yielded highly complex band patterns, which varied from serum to serum. The cancer sera differed from the normal sera, however, as they produced in most cases one or several bands that were distinctly stronger than the others. One of the strong bands, in fact a doublet of approximately 50 kilodaltons (kd), was produced preferentially (although not exclusively) when breast cancer sera were reacted with T47D cell membrane antigens. Absorption of selected sera with normal tissue or MDA antigens abolished or greatly reduced the intensity of some of the bands. It is concluded that, with the possible exception of the 50-kd band, most (probably all) of the bands seen in immunoblots resulted from the binding of autoantibodies to normal antigens expressed by the breast cancer cell lines. The main difference between cancer and normal sera would seem to be an increased content of autoantibodies in cancer, the specificity of these autoantibodies varying, however, from serum to serum.\r"

  ".W": "With the use of proteins derived from Escherichia coli cells expressing the v-H-ras gene product as immunogens and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with whole cells for a screening method, 4 BALB/c mouse hybridoma cell lines (rp-12, rp-28, rp-35, and rp-38) were isolated that produced monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) showing higher reactivity with murine ras gene-activated cell lines than with normal cell lines. All the MoAbs complexed p21ras from the ras gene-activated cell lines in Western immunoblot analysis and demonstrated a binding property of p21ras to guanine nucleotides. The indirect immunofluorescence assay revealed that MoAbs rp-12 and rp-28 stained the murine and human H- or K-ras-activated cell lines, and MoAbs rp-35 and rp-38 not only stained these cell lines but also weakly stained a human N-ras-activated cell line. All these MoAbs stained the murine fibroblast lines with lower intensity, but they did not stain a human fibroblast line. Further, positive reactions with MoAb rp-12 were seen against human melanomas, but there was no reaction against nevi. The rp-12, rp-28, rp-35, and rp-38 antibodies are useful additions to the MoAbs reacting with p21ras reported previously.\r"

Fifty-four patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass had coronary sinus catheters inserted to evaluate the cardiac release of the stable metabolites of prostacyclin (6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha) and thromboxane A2 (thromboxane B2). Arterial concentrations of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 were elevated after cardiac cannulation and during cardiopulmonary bypass. The cardiac release of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was observed after cannulation and during, but not after, cardiopulmonary bypass. Cardiac thromboxane B2 release was detected after cross-clamp release and persisted during the early postoperative period when cardiac 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha release was no longer detectable. Cardiopulmonary bypass stimulated the systemic production of thromboxane and prostacyclin. The cardiac release of thromboxane was unopposed by cardiac prostacyclin production in the early postoperative period and may contribute to reperfusion injury.\r"

The setup used was the isolated perfused working rat heart model and 4 hours of preservation at 0 degree C. The following three groups were prepared: Group 1: the heart was arrested with the cardioplegic solution (potassium: 20 mmol/L, sodium: 87 mmol/L) and then flushed with and stored in Collins' solution (potassium: 117 mmol/L, sodium: 10 mmol/L); Group 2: the heart was arrested with and stored in Collins' solution; and Group 3: the heart was arrested with and stored in the cardioplegic solution. The recovery of cardiac function was more satisfactory in Group 1 than in Groups 2 and 3. The increase in lactate was greater, and adenosine triphosphate and total adenine nucleotide were more depleted during storage in Group 2 than in Groups 1 and 3. In Group 3 myocardial sodium accumulation and potassium depletion during storage were greater than in Groups 1 and 2, and myocardial sodium and calcium overload after reperfusion were greater than in Group 1. Myocardial calcium overload after reperfusion in Group 2 was also greater than that in Group 1. These findings plus coronary vascular resistance analysis revealed that Collins' solution damages the heart during arrest procedures and that the cardioplegic solution is less effective for storage of the arrested heart under deep hypothermia. Therefore the heart should be first arrested with the cardioplegic solution and then flushed with and kept in Collins' solution for simple cold storage.\r"

Quantitative birefringence measurements on cryostat sections of the left ventricular biopsy specimens were used to assess myocardial function. Fifteen donor hearts had poor birefringence assessments before excision, and 67% received inotropic support after implantation; 22 deteriorated during transportation, and 50% received inotropic support; 13 were unchanged throughout the procedure, and none required inotropic support. This study demonstrates the need for improved protection of donor hearts during transportation and recommends the use of rigorous criteria in the selection of these hearts.\r"

Levels of anti-HBs achieved by three 2 micrograms doses were similar to those that have been reported for conventional 10 micrograms doses. Similar levels were recorded from infants of anti-HBs-positive mothers, which suggests that maternal antibody does not interfere with the infant's immune response to low doses of vaccine. Three 2 micrograms doses of vaccine in infancy produce satisfactory immunogenicity and make possible economic control of hepatitis B in endemic areas.\r"

A likely basis for this association is the gram-negative faecal flora,the origin of many septicaemias and a source of bacterial endotoxin, which has potent immunostimulatory effects. A rough-mutant strain, Escherichia coli J5, has only core determinants in its endotoxin,and antibodies to E coli J5 protect animals and human beings from the consequences of septic shock. Naturally occurring antibodies to E coli J5 (\"anti-endotoxin\") were assayed in serum from patients undergoing BMT, healthy controls, and patients with obstructive jaundice. BMT recipients had significantly lower titres than the other two groups. Furthermore, the titre of IgM class anti-J5 antibody was significantly associated with protection from GvHD.\r"

Major hormonal responses to surgery, as indicated by changes in plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, glucagon, aldosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and 11-deoxycortisol levels, in the insulin/glucagon, molar ratio and in blood glucose, lactate, and pyruvate concentrations were significantly greater in the non-fentanyl than in the fentanyl group. The urinary 3-methylhistidine/creatinine ratios were significantly greater in the non-fentanyl group on the second and third postoperative days. Compared with the fentanyl group, the non-fentanyl group had circulatory and metabolic complications postoperatively. The findings indicate that preterm babies mount a substantial stress response to surgery under anaesthesia with nitrous oxide and curare and that prevention of this response by fentanyl anaesthesia may be associated with an improved postoperative outcome.\r"

Although the hypothalamus may be relatively inaccessible to the neurologic clinician, it is, paradoxically, the region of the CNS that most closely communicates with virtually all other physiologic systems. This is evident by the fact that hypothalamic dysfunction is frequently associated with \"non-neurologic\" symptoms such as manifestations of endocrine, gastrointestinal, or gynecologic disease. Traditionally, the hypothalamus has been difficult to study, and progress in understanding hypothalamic disorders has been slow in both neuropathology as well as clinical neurology. Nevertheless, as neurology evolves from a descriptive specialty into one increasingly characterized by therapeutic intervention, the challenge of clinical hypothalamic disease offers many exciting possibilities to the neuropharmacologist, neuroendocrinologist, and all astute bedside clinicians.\r"

  ".W": "The complex interactions of neurosecretions with the developing brain suggest that it has multiple site and time-specific vulnerabilities that may contribute to the pathogenesis of several forms of epilepsy, yet, on the other hand, may provide several new forms of therapy. Catamenial seizures can be clearly related to hormonal changes, although other factors are important, such as altered drug metabolism during menses. Progesterone appears to be especially effective in treating seizures. Optimal forms of treatment for catamenial epilepsy have not been established; however, several forms of progesterone are available and may be helpful, including those in oral contraceptives. Special care in the selection of oral contraceptives may be an important adjunct in caring for women with epilepsy. Altered secretion of neurohormones suggests important clues to the sexual dysfunction and psychopathology associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. New approaches to these patients include the clinical evaluation for sexual dysfunction along with the measurement of prolactin, testosterone, LH, and FSH levels, and treatment of sexual dysfunction by the effective use of anticonvulsants. Elevated plasma hormones (especially prolactin) following seizures can help to distinguish true seizures from pseudoseizures. Effects of anticonvulsant drugs on endocrine function are important, particularly with respect to their ability to lower the efficacy of oral contraceptives by competitive binding. A number of hormonal changes have been described with several drugs, which suggest that their complex central and peripheral effects might help to explain some aspects of normal hormone activity as well as some common side effects of the drugs.\r"

  ".W": "There are four lines of evidence for or against a role of neuropeptides in epilepsy: Administration of a variety of opiate agonists into the ventricles or brain of animals produces a constellation of electrical and behavioral changes, seemingly receptor-specific, both sensitive to the specific opiate antagonist naloxone as well as certain anticonvulsant drugs. The primary reservation concerning these data in terms of their relevance to epilepsy regards the fact that the peptides are exogenously administered in relatively high doses. Hence, these data may reflect neurotoxic effects of peptides rather than physiologic function. A variety of opiate agonists are anticonvulsant and naloxone shortens the postictal state in some experimental seizure models. One could attempt to reconcile these data with those in No. 1 by hypothesizing that the spikes and behavioral changes examined in the latter experimental parodynes represented a sort of isolated model of the postictal state. Naloxone has little effect in clinical epilepsy. These data are far from conclusive for two reasons. First, few patients have been studied. Second, because of the issue of opiate receptor heterogeneity and the high doses of naloxone needed experimentally to block non-mu opiate effects, the doses of naloxone used clinically to date are too low to rule out possible delta- or epsilon-mediated effects. The negative clinical data are illustrative of the dangers and difficulties of extrapolating data generated in animal models of seizures to the human condition. ACTH, a peptide that is derived from the same precursor molecule as beta-endorphin, is clearly an effective anticonvulsant in certain childhood seizure states. However, whether this is due to a direct or indirect (that is, cortisol) effect on brain is far from clear. Paradoxically, in contradistinction to other data concerning pro- and anticonvulsant properties of various opioid peptides, there is no animal model of infantile spasms to help resolve this important question.\r"

Four of these patients are now well and at home after implantation of the device and subsequent cardiac transplantation. Before transplantation, one patient died with sepsis and multiorgan failure that preceded implantation of the artificial heart. Another patient died with acute rejection 60 days after cardiac transplantation. Fifty-two days of total mechanical support with the artificial heart were accumulated in these six patients, and although the device worked flawlessly and no clinically apparent thromboembolic events occurred, each artificial heart contained areas of macroscopic aggregations of platelets and thrombi. The results of this trial indicate that in properly selected cases, direct benefit to the patient can be obtained when the Jarvik-7 artificial heart is used as a bridge to transplantation.\r"

All participants were examined every three months. Bone mineral content in the forearm (measured by single-photon absorptiometry) and in the entire body and spine (measured by dual-photon absorptiometry) remained constant in the estrogen-treated group but decreased significantly in the groups receiving calcium and placebo. In the calcium-treated group, we observed a tendency toward a slowed loss of compact bone (in the proximal forearm and total skeleton) as compared with the placebo group, while the rate of loss of trabecular bone (the distal forearm and spine) was the same as in the placebo group. Our preliminary data suggest that calcium supplementation in the dosage we used is not as effective as estrogen therapy for the prevention of early postmenopausal bone loss. Calcium supplementation may have had a minor effect on the loss of cortical bone, but it had no effect on the trabecular bone.\r"

Recent advances in genetic engineering have made it possible to create novel proteins in a predictable manner where structural information for the protein is available. This 'protein engineering' has already been used to enhance enzyme thermostability, but it is usually not clear which amino acid substitutions should be made. We consider that the following approach should be helpful in engineering proteins with enhanced thermostability: highly conserved residues should be left unchanged; the sequences of known mesophilic and thermophilic proteins should be used to suggest the kinds of changes likely to increase thermostability; and substitutions should be made that increase internal hydrophobicity and that stabilize helices for strong internal packing. We describe here the use of this approach to alter the thermostability of the thermostable neutral protease of Bacillus stearothermophilus, the sequence of which is known. Surprisingly we find that a single mutation that decreases thermostability can require two mutations that increase stability to compensate for it. The effects on stability are not additive, suggesting cooperativity.\r"

These findings were obtained from cells without intact synaptic connections, so the functional roles for such receptor subtypes are unknown. We have recorded intracellular responses from depolarizing bipolar cells (DBC) that receive direct synaptic input from two distinct populations of neurones: rods and cones. We report here that 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB), a glutamate analogue, reveals two subtypes of glutamate receptors on DBCs. APB acts on the same receptor that mediates synaptic transmission from rods but has no action on the second subtype of glutamate receptor. These results show that the rod and cone inputs to DBCs are mediated by pharmacologically distinct receptors and that subtypes of glutamate receptor existing on single neurones can subserve separate, functionally defined synaptic inputs.\r"

Three of the clones express two antigen receptors and both Lyt-2 and L3T4, normally expressed on mutually exclusive subsets of mature T lymphocytes. The pattern of lymphokines produced by the hybrid cells in response to antigen was not controlled by the specific antigen receptor; both T-cell growth factor, produced only by the helper T-cell partner, and gamma-interferon, produced only by the cytolytic T-cell partner, were secreted when either antigen receptor was stimulated. However, cytolytic activity appeared to be restricted to the recognition of antigen by the T-cell receptor of the cytolytic partner. Thus cytolysis appears to be rightly linked to the antigen receptor of the cytolytic parent but lymphokine release is not tightly linked.\r"

Ventriculo-amniotic shunt placement was not part of the management. The outcomes were induced abortion, four patients (20%); intrapartum death, two patients (10%); postnatal death, five patients (25%); and currently alive, nine patients (45%).\r"

  ".W": "The in situ DNA hybridization technique, carried out under stringent conditions, was used to detect human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA of types 6, 11, and 16 in paraffin sections of 32 surgically treated oral mucosal lesions. Expression of HPV structural proteins was analyzed by means of the immunoperoxidase (IP-PAP) method. A total of 10 (31.3%) of the 32 lesions proved to express HPV antigens, which were found in 4 of 7 squamous cell papillomas, in 2 of 2 classic condylomas, in 2 of 10 papillary hyperplasias, and in 2 of 3 leukoplakia lesions. Two of the squamous cell papillomas contained HPV 6 DNA, and 4 additional lesions were positive for HPV 11 DNA. In one of the condylomas, a double infection by HPV 6 and 11 was found, while the second was positive for HPV 11 alone. Both the HPV antigen-positive papillary hyperplasias contained HPV 6 DNA, as did the HPV antigen-positive leukoplakia lesions. Of the latter, one was infected by HPV 6 and 11. DNA of the \"high-risk\" HPV 16 was contained in two lesions: one lichen planus lesion and one of the two squamous cell carcinomas. The results confirm the previously reported evidence of HPV involvement in oral mucosal lesions. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the well-established premalignant character of oral leukoplakia and oral lichen planus, although far less commonly versus leukoplakia, with special emphasis on the discovery of the \"high-risk\" HPV 16 in the latter as well as in oral cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The indications for primary radiotherapy include malignant lymphoma of the thyroid, idiopathic midline granuloma, midline malignant reticulosis, extramedullary plasmacytomas, esthesioneuroblastomas, and locally aggressive benign tumors, such as glomus tumors, angiofibromas, and hemangiomas. Although the traditional treatment for malignant melanoma is surgery, indications are emerging for high-dose radiotherapy, either as the only modality or in addition to surgery. Combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the treatment choice for nonHodgkin's lymphomas of the Waldeyer's ring and for Ewing's sarcomas. High-grade soft tissue sarcomas and salivary gland malignancies are best treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. The use of megavoltage photons and electrons, custom-made blocks delineating the treatment volume, tissue compensators, patient immobilization devices, and simulator-aided treatment planning are mandatory to achieve loco-regional control and to minimize the treatment-related morbidity.\r"

Behavioral assessment procedures are more sophisticated, but research on behavioral assessment of pediatric pain has begun to emergy only recently. There has been very little research on the developmental aspects of pain tolerance and pain threshold in children. There are preliminary indications that children's thoughts and attitudes about pain may change with age in a manner that contributes to more intense feelings of pain in adolescence than childhood. Children undergoing painful medical procedures show declining emotional outbursts with age and increasing signs of self-control and muscular rigidity. Possibilities for integrating the study of the developmental aspects of pain with social learning theory, cognitive developmental theory, and the psychology of physical symptom perception are discussed.\r"

To determine the respective assay sensitivity of these two models in assessing relative efficacy, we reviewed data from 6 phase II, randomized, stratified, parallel, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose studies involving hospitalized women with moderate or severe post-partum uterine cramping (332 patients) or episiotomy pain (434 patients). Using subjective reports as indices of response, patients rated pain intensity and relief at periodic interviews for 6-7 h. Post-partum uterine cramping showed excellent assay sensitivity for detecting differences among peripherally acting analgesics. In the same clinical trial this model could discriminate between a new drug and aspirin 650 mg, a standard reference analgesic, and between 2 graded doses of the new active agent (i.e., good upside sensitivity). In addition the uterine cramp model showed separation between placebo and all active agents (i.e., good downside sensitivity). Episiotomy pain demonstrated similar upside and downside discrimination in clinical trials of several weak centrally acting drugs. These data suggest that post-partum cramping is an excellent pain model for analgesic investigation of new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and episiotomy pain for new weak narcotic and opioid analgesics.\r"

This investigation utilised a 2-group (TENS-treated and placebo TENS-treated), single-blind experimental design. Eighteen multiparous women, each having undergone an elective cesarean delivery, participated in the study. Nine patients received TENS and nine placebo stimulation. The treatment was continuous through to the third day following the day of surgery. The McGill Pain Questionnaire was used to estimate the three most frequent types of post-cesarean-associated pain, and records of the patients' analgesic intake were obtained from hospital charts. The results suggest that TENS was significantly more effective than placebo TENS in reducing cutaneous, movement-associated incisional pain. However, pain resulting from internal structures, i.e., deep pain, afterbirth pain (due to uterine contractions), and the somatic pain associated with decreased peristalsis (gas pains) were not amenable to TENS. No significant differences in analgesic intake were observed. The possible reasons for these findings are discussed.\r"

The resultant stress analgesia is blocked by the previous administration of naloxone and saralasin (angiotensin II antagonist). The intracerebral administration of renin and angiotensin II produces an increase in latencies to thermoalgesic stimuli; this is reduced, as is immobilization stress, by naloxone and saralasin. Both chemical hypophysectomy obtained by dexamethasone pretreatment as well as surgical epiphysectomy block the stress-induced analgesia. The experimental data obtained argue in favour of the participation of the cerebral RAS in stress analgesia through the indirect mechanism of release of opioid peptides.\r"

To test the hypothesis that sexually abused children draw genitalia on human figures more often than do nonabused children, drawings from 57 children, 3 through 7 years of age, who were referred to child protective services as alleged sexual abuse victims, were compared with drawings from an age-, sex-, race-, and socioeconomically matched group of 55 nonabused children receiving well-child care in medical settings. A standardized procedure to obtain drawings was followed by a structured interview to collect demographic, past medical, and developmental information. Five evaluators unaware of the children's backgrounds independently examined drawings for the presence or absence of five body parts; there was 94% agreement for all body parts and 93% agreement for genitalia. Eight children were excluded from the analysis because they only scribbled (n = 5) or because evaluators could not agree on whether genitalia were present in their drawings (n = 3). Ten percent (5/52) of the alleged sexual abuse victims and 2% (1/52) of the comparison children drew genitalia (P = .10, one-tailed Fisher exact test). The estimated relative risk was 5.4; that is, alleged sexual abuse victims were 5.4 times more likely to draw genitalia than were comparison children. Children known to have been sexually abused were 6.8 times more likely to draw genitalia than were comparison children (P = .07, one-tailed Fisher exact test).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fourteen of those procedures were carried out in children 2 to 16 years of age. Two children received combined liver and heart transplants; one because of familial hypercholesterolemia with associated ischemic heart disease, and the other because of dilated cardiomyopathy associated with intrahepatic biliary atresia. Eight patients had dilated cardiomyopathy, and two had myocarditis. Two had heart transplantations for congenital heart disease: one had multiple muscular ventricular septal defects repaired in infancy and had an associated cardiomyopathy, and the other developed a cardiomyopathic ventricle from a congenital right coronary artery to right atrial fistula. Chronic immune suppression consisted 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg/d of prednisone and 5 to 50 mg/kg/d cyclosporine, with the addition of antithymocyte globulin for unresolved moderate or severe acute rejection. There were three early postoperative deaths: one from intracranial bleeding, one from Pseudomonas mediastinitis, and one from ischemic injury to transplanted organs. Early postoperative complications included reversible renal failure, hypertension, and seizures. Late problems were related to allograft rejection and side effects of cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Significant rejection episodes occurred in all patients surviving longer than 2 weeks, with seven requiring antithymocyte globulin. Two patients died 8 months following transplantation of severe acute and chronic rejection; another patient required retransplantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy resulting from chronic rejection but subsequently died of recurring rejection 3 months after the second transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty-one low birth weight infants with severe hyaline membrane disease were randomly assigned to saline or surfactant therapy and treated within eight hours of birth. Significant improvements in oxygenation (increased arterial/alveolar PO2) and respiratory support (decreased mean airway pressure) were seen in the group receiving surfactant within four hours after treatment. These improvements were maintained in the surfactant-treated infants, who also had fewer pneumothoraces and fewer number of days in environments of fractional inspiratory oxygen greater than 0.4 mm Hg. No problems were associated with administration of surfactant, and no acute side effects were detected. We conclude that exogenous surfactant, administered early in the course of severe hyaline membrane disease, is an effective therapy that can diminish the amount of respiratory support required during the first 48 hours of life.\r"

The efficacy of vitamin E supplementation for the prevention of anemia in premature infants has been studied in a randomized, controlled, and blinded trial. Premature infants whose birth weights were less than 1,500 g were given, by gavage, 25 IU of dl-alpha-tocopherol or a similar volume of the drug vehicle. Treatment was continued for the first 6 weeks of life. A total of 178 infants were studied. Vitamin E levels were significantly higher in a supplemented group by day 3 and for the remainder of the 6-week period. At 6 weeks of age, there was no significant difference between the supplemented and unsupplemented groups in hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte and platelet counts, or erythrocyte morphology. It is concluded that there is no evidence to support a policy of administering vitamin E to premature infants to prevent the anemia of prematurity.\r"

Here we show that N3ATP efficiently modifies purified peptide T-31 and show that the interaction is specific by the following criteria: photolabeling of peptide T-31 is saturable with respect to the N3ATP concentration; photolabeling is competitive with ATP and adenosine but not with adenine, UTP, or TTP; and other peptides derived from RecA protein were poor substrates for photolabeling except for one fragment that showed a nonspecific interaction with the photoaffinity analog. Analysis of N3ATP-modified T-31 shows that the photolabel attaches to more than one site within the peptide. These data argue that peptide T-31 contains some sites of contact for adenine and ribose moieties of ATP when it is bound to RecA protein.\r"

Multidrug resistance in DoxR MCF7 cells (called AdrR MCF7 cell line in previous publications) is associated with biochemical changes similar to those induced by carcinogens in rat hyperplastic liver nodules (HNs) and associated with resistance to xenobiotics in that system. In HNs and DoxR cells, exposure to a single agent results in the selection of cells that are cross-resistant to a wide variety of structurally dissimilar toxic agents. Resistance in both systems is associated with decreases in intracellular accumulation of toxins and changes in phase I (decreased cytochrome P1-450) and phase II (increased glutathione transferase and glucuronyltransferase) drug-metabolizing activities. In HNs and DoxR cells, resistance is associated with the induction of relatively stable levels of an immunologically related anionic glutathione transferase isozyme (EC 2.5.1.18). The finding of similar biochemical changes associated with the development of resistance to various xenobiotics in HNs and to many naturally occurring antineoplastic agents and at least one carcinogen (benzo[a]pyrene) in DoxR MCF7 cells suggests that the mechanisms of resistance in these two models may be similar.\r"

Expression of the wild-type promoter, measured in a DNA-dependent transcription-translation system, was strongly dependent on ppGpp; addition of ppGpp stimulated his expression 22-fold with plasmid DNA templates. Oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutations that increase the homology of the -10 hexamer to the consensus sequence of the E sigma 70 promoters dramatically increased his expression in the absence of ppGpp and reduced the stimulation to less than a factor of 2. A deletion mutation that alters the sequence between the -10 hexamer and the start point of transcription, generated by BAL-31 nuclease, affected ppGpp regulation in a similar manner. We propose that the -10 hexamer sequence and the adjacent downstream region are both important in regulating transcription by ppGpp. Mechanisms to account for activation and repression of transcription by ppGpp are discussed.\r"

The final purified factor lacks DNA polymerase alpha, RNA polymerase, and DNA-unwinding or topoisomerase type I activities. The stimulatory activity is destroyed by trypsin (60 min at 37 degrees C), DNase II (60 min at 37 degrees C), and heat treatment (2 min at 68 degrees C). The 125I-labeled NPF-1 does not bind to activated calf thymus DNA or poly(dC). However, it forms a ternary complex with DNA in the presence of DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex (alpha 1 and alpha 2). The ternary complex sediments on sucrose density gradient as a heavier band (11S). The NPF-1 also stimulates (2.5-fold) primase-catalyzed incorporation of GMP and dGMP from the corresponding triphosphates on poly(dC) template even in the presence of a high concentration of alpha-amanitin (400 micrograms/ml). The labeled duplex containing the poly(dC) template, [32P]-GTP, and [3H]dGTP loses 80% of the 32P label and 70% of the 3H label after treatment with 0.3 M KOH and DNase I, respectively. The products were isolated from reaction mixtures incubated with and without NPF-1 and subjected to alkaline sucrose-density-gradient sedimentation analysis. The results suggest that the rate of synthesis of DNA short chains is increased in the presence of NPF-1 without a concomitant increase in the chain length of the newly synthesized products.\r"

The hsdS genes of the SB and SP systems have a conserved sequence of around 100 base pairs flanked by two nonhomologous (variable) regions of around 500 base pairs. Recombination between the hsdS genes of SB and SP generated a system (SQ) with a different recognition specificity. We have localized the position of the crossover in the central conserved region by analysis of nucleotide sequences. Concomitant with the generation of a new combination of flanking variable regions is the recombination of minor differences in the central conserved region. A polypeptide domain encoded on the 5' side of the crossover dictates recognition of the trinucleotide component of the target sequence, and a second domain, encoded on the 3' side of the crossover, similarly governs recognition of the tetra- or penta-nucleotide component. Our analysis implicates at least parts of the variable regions in the determination of the specificity of interaction between protein and DNA. Furthermore, the trinucleotide components of the recognition sequences of S. typhimurium and Escherichia coli K-12 are identical, and the 5' segments of their hsdS genes are strikingly homologous rather than variable.\r"

In homogenates of either rat brain or liver, incubation with diacylglycerol or phospholipase C, but not phospholipase A2 or phospholipase D, resulted in the translocation of diacylglycerol kinase activity from the soluble to the particulate fraction. This observation formed the basis for the first step in a two-step purification of diacylglycerol kinase. Enzyme extracted in 1 M salt from membranes of rat brain homogenates made in the presence of phospholipase C was purified further by affinity chromatography on a column containing phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and cholesterol immobilized in polyacrylamide. This step yielded an enzyme preparation (step 2 enzyme) that was 500- to 750-fold purified (relative to the tissue homogenate) and required phosphatidylserine for stability. All other lipids tested failed to stabilize the enzyme. The properties of the enzyme preparation were similar to those of mammalian diacylglycerol kinases described by others. Reconstitution experiments showed that the soluble step 2 enzyme bound to inside-out vesicles of human erythrocytes only in the presence of diacylglycerol or phospholipase C but not phospholipase A2 or D. Redistribution of the kinase from soluble to vesicle-bound forms occurred rapidly and was dependent on the concentration of phospholipase C used to treat the vesicles. Physiological concentrations of calcium (50-1000 nM) did not enhance the phospholipase C-mediated translocation of the kinase. Thus, diacylglycerol kinase can translocate from cytosol to membranes in a manner dependent on the content of membrane-bound diacylglycerol but independent of the ambient concentration of calcium.\r"

The gene product can be divided into two distinct regions, a globular head region and a long alpha-helical, rod-like tail. In comparisons with nematode and mammalian muscle myosins, specific areas of the head region are highly conserved. These areas presumably reflect conserved functional and structural domains. Certain features that are present in the head region of nematode and mammalian muscle myosins, and that have been assumed to be important for myosin function, are missing in the Dictyostelium myosin sequence. The protein sequence of the Dictyostelium tail region is very poorly conserved with respect to the other myosins but displays the periodicities similar to those of muscle myosins. These periodicities are believed to play a role in filament formation. The 196-residue repeating unit that determines the 14.3-nm repeat seen in muscle thick filaments, the 28-residue charge repeating unit, and the 1,4 hydrophobic repeat previously described for the nematode myosin are all present in the Dictyostelium myosin rod sequence, suggesting that the filament structures of muscle and Dictyostelium myosins must be similar.\r"

The 5' flanking region was designed for efficient expression of this gene in Escherichia coli by incorporating an optimum ribosome binding site and spacer region. Both a soluble form, analogous to the protease-treated microsomal protein, as well as the complete cytochrome with hydrophobic membrane anchor, was constructed and expressed. Transformants with the gene for the soluble protein overproduce authentic cytochrome b5 to a level of 8% of the total cell protein. The complete cytochrome is expressed to a lesser extent with most of the protein found in the cell membrane fraction. This represents complete synthesis and bacterial expression of a mammalian metalloprotein gene. Cytochrome b5 is normally a six-coordinate low spin heme protein with histidine-39 and histidine-63 as axial ligands. We have replaced histidine-63 with a methionine residue by cassette mutagenesis, utilizing specific restriction enzyme sites engineered into the synthetic gene. The resultant protein has histidine-39 as sole axial ligand and is five-coordinate high spin in the ferric resting state, as indicated by optical and electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The ability to generate mutant cytochrome b5 in high yield is a crucial step in understanding heme protein folding, protein-protein recognition and binding, and biological electron transfer processes.\r"

There was a rapid accumulation of c-fos mRNA in fibroblasts and adipocytes treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, fetal calf serum, bombesin, and insulin, especially in the adipocytes. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate pretreatment abolished the increase in c-fos mRNA due to additional phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment and decreased but did not eliminate the ability of platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, fetal calf serum, bombesin, and insulin to stimulate c-fos mRNA. These data suggested that c-fos mRNA could be induced in serum-deprived 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes by at least two separate pathways, one involving protein kinase C and the other independent of protein kinase C. In the very insulin-sensitive 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin rapidly and transiently increased c-fos expression (c-fos mRNA appeared by 15 min and disappeared after 60 min) via interaction with its own cellular receptor, rather than by interacting with receptors for one of the insulin-like growth factors. Cycloheximide treatment in combination with insulin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in superinduction of c-fos mRNA. We conclude that insulin can rapidly stimulate c-fos mRNA accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that part of the growth factor-stimulated increase in this mRNA that occurs in protein kinase C-deficient cells may be due to activation of a pathway similar or identical to that activated by insulin.\r"

The mode of disruption as well as of recovery of stress fibers was very similar to that found previously in experiments performed with the actin-severing protein brevin, an extracellular variant of gelsolin. PFK, like brevin, was also capable of disrupting stress fibers in detergent-extracted cells and in ethanol-fixed cells, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. When compared with heart muscle gelsolin, PFK comigrated with the 85- to 90-kDa band. Antibodies against PFK crossreacted with gelsolin from the same species. These results point to a tight association between polypeptides with similar biochemical and immunological parameters present in both preparations. They suggest hitherto unexpected cellular control mechanisms for both microfilament functions and glycolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the major heat shock and stress-induced protein, HSP70, is under complex regulatory control in human cells. In addition to being induced by physiological stress such as heat shock or transition metals, the HSP70 gene is induced by serum stimulation and immortalizing products of the adenovirus E1A 13S and polyoma large tumor antigen genes. Here we show that expression of the human HSP70 gene is tightly regulated during the cell cycle. Using selective mitotic detachment, a noninductive method to obtain synchronous populations of HeLa cells, we show that levels of HSP70 mRNA rapidly increase 10- to 15-fold upon entry into S phase and decline by late S and G2. A transient increase in HSP70 synthesis is detected during early S phase. The subcellular localization of HSP70 varies throughout the cell cycle; the protein is diffusely distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm in G1, localized in the nucleus in S, and again diffusely distributed in G2 cells. We suggest that the temporal pattern of HSP70 expression during S phase, the nuclear localization, and activation by trans-acting immortalizing proteins indicate a role for HSP70 in the nucleus of replicating cells.\r"

Such a finding provides to our knowledge the first direct evidence for antitermination activity at a known rho-dependent site by the psu gene product.

The cDNA nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of the c-myb protein are highly homologous to the corresponding chicken and mouse proteins. In particular, a region toward the NH2 terminus of the protein containing a 3-fold tandem repeat of 51 residues is evolutionarily conserved and is the only region of homology with the Drosophila c-myb protein. This region may represent a functionally important structure, most likely the DNA-binding domain. cDNA clones have been used to isolate genomic clones and to define a preliminary intron/exon organization of the c-myb gene. Identification of 5' and 3' coding and noncoding exons indicates that the human c-myb locus spans a 40-kilobase region.\r"

Genetic deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase results in glycogen-storage disease type II, encompassing a spectrum of disorders of varying severity. To study the molecular basis for this heterogeneity, we sought to clone the coding sequence for human acid alpha-glucosidase. We screened 10(6) recombinant phage from a human liver cDNA expression library with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to human acid alpha-glucosidase. When we retested positive phage for reactivity to monoclonal antibodies, we identified a single phage, containing a 2-kilobase (kb) cDNA insert, that reacted with both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The 2-kb cDNA hybridized to a 20-kb EcoRI fragment of human genomic DNA. This 20-kb EcoRI fragment was present only in DNA from somatic cell hybrids that retained the human chromosome 17 segment q21-q23, which contains the gene for human acid alpha-glucosidase. The cDNA also hybridized to a 3.4-kb mRNA, consistent with the size (approximately 105 kDa) of the acid alpha-glucosidase protein. Finally, in one of two infantile-onset acid alpha-glucosidase-deficient cell lines tested, the 3.4-kb mRNA was not detectable, whereas in an adult-onset cell line, an mRNA of reduced size and amount was found. Examination of DNA digested with restriction enzymes did not reveal any major deletions in the genomic DNA of these patients.\r"

In our present study, we have found that the pi level in cell extracts of Escherichia coli strains containing R6K derivatives is surprisingly high (approximately equal to 10(4) dimers per cell) and that this level is not altered in cells carrying high copy number pir mutants. The wild-type and a high copy mutant (Cos405) pir gene were inserted downstream of promoters of different strengths to measure the copy number of an R6K gamma replicon as a function of a 1000-fold range of intracellular pi concentrations. The data demonstrate that reducing the intracellular level of pi to 5% of its normal value can result in a substantial increase in copy number of a gamma origin replicon and that a pi level less than 1% of normal is still permissive for replication. Conversely, increasing the pi level even a few-fold above normal results in a marked inhibition of replication of plasmids containing a single, two, or all three of the R6K origins (alpha, beta, and gamma). We have also shown that the replication inhibition mediated by excess pi is greatly reduced by the pir405 Cos mutation. These results demonstrate that the total level of pi protein is not rate-limiting for a gamma replicon. We have also determined the sensitivity of the pir gene promoter to a wide range of pi concentrations. The activity of this promoter is stimulated by very low pi levels and is almost entirely inhibited when the protein is overproduced 2-fold.\r"

Several goats immunized with the gp120 produced antibodies that neutralized infection of H9 cells by the homologous virus isolate. These same sera failed to neutralize the divergent HTLV-IIIRF isolate. Individuals infected with HTLV-III commonly develop antibodies to gp120 that could be isolated by using the gp120 antigen coupled to an immunoadsorbent resin. The antibody fraction that bound tightly to such a resin was found to neutralize the IIIB but not the RF isolate in a similar fashion as the goat anti-gp120 sera. However, the nonbinding fraction (effluent) from the resin also contained neutralizing activity that was able to block infection by both virus isolates with similar efficacy. Human antibodies to the other virus envelope gene product, the transmembrane gp41, were also affinity purified by utilizing the recombinant peptide 121, but these failed to influence infection by either virus isolate.\r"

Purification of oncostatin M has been achieved by gel chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC, using sequentially acetonitrile and n-propanol in the presence of aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The apparent molecular weight of oncostatin M is approximately 18,000, as determined by gel chromatography, and 28,000, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified polypeptide has been determined. No substantial sequence homology between oncostatin M and other proteins was found, including other tumor cell inhibitory proteins produced by mononuclear cells. Oncostatin M, therefore, appears to represent a distinct cell growth regulator.\r"

In the former group the insulin response to glucose declined progressively with age (r = -0.575; P less than 0.01) and at 140 days was significantly below age-matched diabetes-resistant controls (P less than 0.05). The insulin response to arginine did not decline with age in either group. For diabetic rats, on the first day of the diabetes, the insulin response to glucose was absent but the response to arginine did not differ from nondiabetic controls. On day 14 responses to glucose and arginine were both absent. The glucagon response to arginine showed no trend despite a decline in baseline glucagon secretion. Endocrine tissue in nondiabetic diabetes-prone rats made up 0.8 +/- 0.2% of the pancreas at 60 days of age and 0.52 +/- 0.22% at 140 days of age; the latter was significantly less than in 140-day-old diabetes-resistant controls (P less than 0.05). In diabetic rats on the 1st and 14th days of diabetes endocrine tissue was 0.2 +/- 0.1% and 0.07 +/- 0.02%, respectively. The glucose transport rate in islets isolated on the first day of diabetes was profoundly reduced compared to age-matched nondiabetic diabetes-prone controls. Thus, a population of arginine-responsive, glucose-unresponsive islets with low glucose transport rates is present at the onset of overt diabetes in BB/W rats.\r"

Molecular clones containing JC virus, BK virus, lymphotropic papovavirus, bovine papilloma virus, type 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), and varicella-zoster virus sequences increased CAT expression directed by the HIV LTR. Trans-activation of the HIV LTR varied in different cell lines, but in each case the HIV tat gene product elicited the greatest stimulation. Primer-extension assays specific for HIV LTR mRNA revealed increased levels of steady-state RNA following transfection with HIV tat as well as with several of the DNA viruses. Virus-specific RNA expression paralleled the stimulation of CAT activity. More-than-additive effects were observed at both the RNA and protein levels when tat plus type 1 herpes simplex virus DNAs or tat plus JC virus DNAs were transfected into cells with the HIV LTR-CAT plasmid. These data suggest that coinfection of cells by HIV and some DNA viruses can stimulate the expression of HIV.\r"

The translocation breakpoint on chromosome 9 occurs near the ABL gene and correlates with the production of a chronic myelogenous leukemia-specific 8.5-kilobase ABL-related mRNA species accompanied by a structurally altered ABL protein (P210c-abl). The N-terminal sequence of the protein is derived from the BCR gene on chromosome 22. We have isolated overlapping cDNA clones from the K-562 cell line corresponding to approximately 8.5 kilobases of mRNA and have sequenced 2550 nucleotides at the 5' end. Our results indicate that the 5' end of the 8.5-kilobase mRNA consists of greater than 400 nucleotides of noncoding sequence that are greater than 80% G + C rich. Based on our sequence analysis, we propose that initiation of translation occurs at nucleotide 471, such that the initial 927 amino acids of P210c-abl are derived from BCR sequences. Our cDNA clones thus define the complete coding sequences for the P210c-abl gene product.\r"

The majority of the phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase-immunoreactive nerve cells of the adrenergic cell groups C1-C3 and of the dorsal subnuclei of the nucleus tractus solitarius in the medulla oblongata were also strongly immunoreactive for glucocorticoid receptor. In the midbrain dopaminergic groups A8-A10, moderately (A8, A9) to strongly (A10) glucocorticoid receptor-immunoreactive cells were found, ranging from 40 to 75% of the total population. In the hypothalamic dopaminergic cell groups, all the cells of groups A12 and A14, as well as the majority of the dopaminergic cells of the zona incerta (A13), were found to contain moderate to strong glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactivity, but none of the large dopaminergic cells of the posterior hypothalamus (A11) showed such immunoreactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Phototropism in the fungus Phycomyces is mediated by two photosystems that are optimized for the low-intensity region (below 10(-6) W X m-2) and the high-intensity region (above 10(-6) W X m-2). These photosystems can be distinguished under special experimental conditions, in which sporangiophores grown in the dark are suddenly exposed to continuous unilateral light. With this treatment, the bending occurs in two steps. Below 10(-6) W X m-2, an early-response component (15-min latency) and a late-response component (50- to 70-min latency) are observed that are mediated by photosystem I. Above 10(-6) W X m-2, the early component is augmented by an intermediate component with a 40-min delay that is mediated by photosystem II. The two photosystems are distinguished further by their wavelength sensitivities and adaptation kinetics. Photosystem I is more effective at 334, 347, and 550 nm than photosystem II, but it is less effective at 383 nm. At wavelength 450 nm, the dark-adaptation kinetics associated with photosystem I are approximately half as fast as those associated with photosystem II. However, the light-adaptation kinetics of photosystem I are approximately equal to 3 times faster than the kinetics associated with photosystem II. The existence of two photosystems clarifies several behavioral features of Phycomyces and helps explain how the sporangiophore can manage the full range of 10 decades.\r"

  ".W": "It is speculated that the transmission of an insulin signal across the plasma membrane of cells occurs through activation of the tyrosine-specific receptor kinase, autophosphorylation of the receptor, and subsequent phosphorylation of unidentified substrates in the cell. In an attempt to identify possible substrates, we labeled intact rat fat cells with [32P]orthophosphate and used an antiphosphotyrosine antibody to identify proteins that become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in an insulin-stimulated way. In the membrane fraction of the fat cells, we found, in addition to the 95-kDa beta-subunit of the receptor, a 46-kDa phosphoprotein that is phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosine residues. This protein is not immunoprecipitated by antibodies against different regions of the insulin receptor and its HPLC tryptic peptide map is different from the tryptic peptide map of the insulin receptor, suggesting that it is not derived from the receptor beta-subunit. Insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 46-kDa protein within 150 sec in the intact cell 3- to 4-fold in a dose-dependent way at insulin concentrations between 0.5 nM and 100 nM. The insulin effect starts after 30 sec, is maximal at 150 sec, and declines to almost basal values by 5 min. Furthermore, the antiphosphotyrosine antibody precipitated at least five proteins in the soluble fraction of the fat cell. Insulin (0.5 nM, 100 nM) stimulated within 2 min the 32P incorporation into a 116-kDa band, a 62-kDa band, and three bands between 45 kDa and 50 kDa 2- to 10-fold. We suggest that the 46-kDa membrane protein and possibly also the soluble proteins are endogenous substrates of the receptor tyrosine kinase in fat cells and that their phosphorylation is an early step in insulin signal transmission.\r"

In addition, the B subunit potentiated the response of the 3T3 cells to other mitogens, such as epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin. This synergistic effect indicates that the B subunit does not act identically to any of these growth factors but probably modulates a common effector system crucial for cell proliferation. In distinct contrast, the B subunit inhibited the growth of ras-transformed 3T3 cells as well as rapidly dividing normal 3T3 cells. Thus, the same cells, depending on their state of growth, exhibited a bimodal response to the B subunit. We conclude that endogenous gangliosides may be bimodal regulators of positive and negative signals for cell growth.\r"

Here we describe similar chromosome changes in 11 lines of CHEF/18 cells transfected with the mutant c-Ha-ras containing plasmid pSV2gptEJ. All 11 lines contained the transfected EJ gene and expressed increased levels of p21, the EJ gene product. Ten of the 11 lines were tumorigenic and all but 2 of these were trisomic for all or part of 3q. One line remained diploid and was nontumorigenic despite expressing elevated p21. Two tumorigenic lines from \"hit-and-run\" transfection with pSV2gpt were shown to express only control levels of p21, but they were trisomic for 3q. These results show that increased p21 expression is neither necessary nor sufficient for inducing tumorigenicity of CHEF cells. We propose that tumorigenicity in the transfected CHEF/18 cells of this study was induced by chromosome rearrangements, especially trisomy for 3q, that occurred at increased frequencies following transfection with pSV2gptEJ.\r"

The possibility that retroviral insertions into the mouse genome resulted in gain or loss mutations at non-H-2 histocompatibility loci was investigated by reciprocal skin grafting between Mov mice and mice from coisogenic, background strains. Two B6-derived and eight 129-derived Mov strains were analyzed. B6 mice rejected skin from the viremic Mov-3 and Mov-14 strains, indicating that these mice had new histocompatibility antigens. No rejections were observed with reciprocal skin grafts exchanged between mice of the 129 background strain and 129-derived Mov strains, one of which (Mov-9) is viremic. To investigate the potential viral origin of the new histocompatibility antigen in Mov-14, lymphocytes from B6 mice primed in vivo with Mov-14 cells or skin were restimulated in vitro with Mov-14 spleen cells and with two retroviral-induced B6 lymphomas, MBL-2 and RBL-5. All three cell types stimulated cytotoxic lymphocytes that lysed Mov-14 Con A lymphoblasts, MBL-2 and RBL-5. The same cytotoxic lymphocytes lysed only lymphoblasts from the viremic Mov-9 strain when tested on cells from 129 and 129 Mov mice. Thus the insertion and expression of exogenous Moloney murine leukemia virus results in the appearance of a new histocompatibility antigen as defined by its stimulation of skin-graft rejection and cytotoxic effector T-cell generation. The non-H-2 histocompatibility antigen identified in this study has been designated H-43 and is encoded by genes mapping to different loci in different Mov strains. These observations suggest that at least a subgroup of non-H-2 histocompatibility antigens is encoded by endogenous retroviruses; the implications of these results for understanding the origin and the identity of non-H-2 histocompatibility antigens are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Cytoplasmic extracts from spontaneously proliferating and mitogen-activated lymphoid cells contain a protein factor called ADR (activator of DNA replication) that induces DNA synthesis in isolated quiescent nuclei. ADR-containing preparations have proteolytic activity, as indicated by their ability to degrade fibrin in a plasminogen-independent and plasminogen-dependent manner. In addition, aprotinin, a nonspecific protease inhibitor, abrogates ADR-induced DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion. Preincubation studies demonstrated that the effect of aprotinin is not due to its suppressive effects on the nuclei themselves. Other protease inhibitors such as leupeptin, p-aminobenzamidine, and N-alpha-tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone are also inhibitory, but soybean trypsin inhibitor is without effect. ADR activity can be removed from active extracts by adsorption with aprotinin-conjugated agarose beads and can be recovered by elution with an acetate buffer (pH 5). These findings are consistent with the interpretation that the initiation of DNA synthesis in resting nuclei may be protease dependent and, further, that the cytoplasmic stimulatory factor we have called ADR may be a protease itself.\r"

TyrOHase is present in high concentrations in the caudate nucleus and putamen, where nearly all of it is contained in axons of the dopaminergic mesostriatal pathways. We have employed three different polyclonal antibodies directed against TyrOHase, one tested here for specificity by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, to reexamine the anatomic distribution of fibers expressing TyrOHase-like immunoreactivity in the striatum of mature human, monkey, and cat brains. The findings suggest that this distribution is distinctly inhomogeneous. The macroscopic compartments known as striosomes have low TyrOHase-like immunoreactivity relative to the surrounding extrastriosomal matrix. These observations add to evidence that dopaminergic modulation of neural processing in the mature striatum is organized in accordance with striosomal architecture and suggest that part of the mechanism for such differentiation may involve presynaptic differences in enzymatic regulation of dopamine content in and out of striosomes.\r"

This antiserum specifically recognized the peptide in a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. Specificity of the antiserum for the native channel protein was shown by its specific binding to a 280-kDa protein in immunoblots of eel electroplax membrane proteins. The antiserum also specifically labeled the innervated membrane of the eel electroplax in immunofluorescent studies; noninnervated membrane was not labeled, consistent with the known distribution of sodium channels in this tissue. The membrane topology of the peptide recognized by this antiserum was probed in binding studies using oriented electroplax membrane vesicles. These vesicles were 98% \"right-side-out\" as determined by [3H]saxitoxin binding. Binding of the antipeptide antiserum to this fraction was measured before and after permeabilization with 0.01% saponin. Specific binding to intact vesicles was low, but this binding increased 10-fold after permeabilization, implying a cytoplasmic orientation for the peptide. Confirmation for this orientation was then sought by localizing the antibody bound to intact electroplax cells with immunogold electron microscopy. Gold particles identifying the antibody were found almost exclusively associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the innervated membrane. Our data imply that the region of the sodium channel primary sequence near the C terminus that is recognized by our antiserum is localized on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane; this localization provides some further constraints on models of sodium channel tertiary structure.\r"

  ".U": "87092389\r", 
  ".W": "Many oligomeric enzymes are functional only in the assembled form, and it is often difficult to determine unambiguously why monomers are inactive. In some cases individual monomers cannot fold into stable correct (\"native\") conformations without contributions from interchain interactions. For other oligomers, catalysis requires the contributions of amino acid residues at the interface between adjacent polypeptide chains, and monomers are inactive because they cannot form complete active sites. A test for the presence of shared sites was devised that is based on the formation of active hybrid oligomers from appropriate inactive parental mutants produced by site-directed mutagenesis. This approach was applied in a study of the catalytic trimer of aspartate transcarbamoylase (aspartate carbamoyltransferase, EC 2.1.3.2) from Escherichia coli, using three mutants, in which Ser-52 was replaced by His, Lys-84 by Gln, or His-134 by Ala. Hybrid trimers formed from the virtually inactive Ser and Lys mutants were 10(5) more active than the parental proteins, and the specific activities of each hybrid were about 33% that of the wild-type trimer, as expected for the scheme based on shared sites. Hybrids from the His and Lys mutants had comparable specific activities. Moreover, one hybrid with approximately 33% activity had one high-affinity binding site for a bisubstrate analog as compared to about three for wild-type trimer. As a further test, hybrids were also formed from wild-type and double-mutant (Lys-84----Gln and His-134----Ala) trimers. The hybrid containing two chains with the double mutation and one wild-type chain had very little activity, and that composed of one double mutant and two wild-type chains had 32% the specific activity of wild-type trimers. This negative complementation experiment is in quantitative accord with the scheme based on shared sites at or near the interfaces between adjacent chains. The techniques used to demonstrate shared active sites in the catalytic subunits of aspartate transcarbamoylase can be applied generally to various types of oligomers (dimers, tetramers, etc.) to determine whether the participation of amino acid residues from adjoining chains is essential for forming active sites in oligomeric enzymes.\r"

Injection of this inhibitory antibody resulted in a decreased ability of insulin to stimulate the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose in Chinese hamster ovary cells and freshly isolated rat adipocytes, ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation in CHO cells, and glycogen synthesis in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. The ability of insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II to stimulate glucose uptake in TA1 mouse adipocytes was also inhibited. Studies with CHO cells demonstrated that these effects of the inhibitory antibody were specific, since there was no change in phorbol ester-stimulated glucose uptake and injection of a noninhibiting antibody to the kinase had no effect on insulin action. These studies indicate that the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor is important in mediating several rapid insulin effects in a variety of different cell types.\r"

Overproduction of the mutant tRNAs using M13 recombinants as an expression vector and development of a one-step purification scheme allowed us to purify, characterize, and analyze the function of the mutant tRNAs. After aminoacylation and formylation, the function of mutant formylmethionyl tRNAs was analyzed in an MS2 RNA-directed in vitro protein-synthesizing system, in AUG-dependent ribosomal P site binding, and in initiation factor binding. The mutant tRNAs show progressive loss of activity in initiation, the mutant with all three G X C base pairs substituted being the least active. The mutations affect binding to the ribosomal P site. None of the mutations affects binding to initiation factor 2. We also show that there is a progressive increase in accessibility of phosphodiester bonds in the anticodon loop of the three mutants to S1 nuclease, such that the cleavage pattern of the mutant with all three G X C base-pair changes resembles that of elongator tRNAs. These results are consistent with the notion that the contiguous G X C base pairs in the anticodon stem of initiator tRNAs impart on the anticodon loop a unique conformation, which may be important in targeting the initiator tRNA to the ribosomal P site during initiation of protein synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Dideoxy chain-termination DNA sequencing was used to determine the specific DNA base changes induced after in vivo exposure of Escherichia coli to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) using the xanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (gpt) gene as the genetic target. The resultant mutation spectra were compared with the levels of O6-alkylguanine and O4-alkylthymidine in genomic DNA immediately after exposure. All (39/39) of the MNU-induced mutations were G X C----A X T transitions. In contrast, 24/33 point mutations isolated following ENU treatment were G X C----A X T transitions, 7/33 were A X T----G X C transitions, 1/33 was a G X C----C X G transversion, and 1/33 was an A X T----C X G transversion. Three large insertions, probably of spontaneous origin, were also isolated. O4-alkylthymidine/O6-alkylguanine ratios were 0.014 for MNU and 0.28 for ENU. These data suggest that the difference in the mutation spectrum of MNU versus ENU may be attributed, in part, to the different ratio of O6-alkylguanine versus O4-alkylthymidine produced in the DNA. Of the G X C----A X T transitions, 82% of the MNU- and 71% of the ENU-induced mutations occurred at the middle guanine of the sequence 5'-GG(A or T)-3'.\r"

  ".W": "The substrate specificity of rat mast cell protease I (RMCP I), a chymotrypsin-like serine protease localized in the secretory granules of mast cells, was compared to that of bovine alpha-chymotrypsin by using several peptide and protein substrates of known amino acid sequences. Although the overall specificities of the two proteases appeared similar, subtle but significant differences were observed. RMCP I was more prone than chymotrypsin to hydrolyze peptide bonds consisting of Leu-Xaa or two hydrophobic residues--e.g., Phe-Phe. Additionally, the hydrolysis of angiotensin I catalyzed by chymotrypsin, but not by RMCP I, resulted in the generation of angiotensin II as an intermediate product. In contrast to the solubilized enzyme, the RMCP I activity within the insoluble granules was completely stable for at least 2 months in suitable buffers at pH 8.0 or pH 7.2, at 4 degrees C. Carboxypeptidase A activity associated with isolated mast cell granules was completely inhibited by 10 mM o-phenanthroline. Polypeptides smaller than apomyoglobin (17,199 Da) were rapidly hydrolyzed by granule-bound RMCP I, whereas apomyoglobin and other larger proteins were not hydrolyzed. In contrast, the free protease readily hydrolyzed the larger proteins. Neither normal rat serum nor alpha 1-antitrypsin, both of which inhibited the activity of free RMCP I, was effective in inhibiting granule-associated RMCP I. The results indicate that granule-bound RMCP I is not released into solution from isolated secretory granules under physiological conditions of ionic strength and pH and that the granule structure limits the size of proteins that can be hydrolyzed by the protease.\r"

  ".W": "The PutA protein, product of the Escherichia coli gene putA, has two functions essential for proline utilization and for the regulation of putP and putA expression: as the peripheral membrane flavoprotein, proline dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.99.8), it transfers electrons from proline to the respiratory chain, and, as a repressor, it controls expression of genes putP and putA in response to proline supply. Association of proline dehydrogenase with the membrane was shown to require the simultaneous presence of the soluble enzyme, membranes, and proline. The kinetics of that association, monitored by following proline oxidation in a coupled enzyme assay system, were not altered when the transmembrane proton gradient generated during proline oxidation was dissipated by a proton ionophore. However, D-lactate or NADH could replace proline as a promoter of proline dehydrogenase-membrane association under anaerobic reaction conditions. These data imply that reduction of proline dehydrogenase and/or a membrane constituent promotes enzyme-membrane association. A biochemical mechanism is suggested whereby the concentration of proline dehydrogenase associated with the respiratory chain would be determined by proline supply.\r"

Nagarse under the same conditions, however, greatly decreased the malonyl-CoA inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity, the high-affinity binding of malonyl-CoA to mitochondria, and the ability of malonyl-CoA to shift to the right the sigmoid activity curve of carnitine palmitoyltransferase observed with variations in palmitoyl-CoA concentration. No noticeable effect of Nagarse pretreatment was observed on the binding of octanoyl-CoA to mitochondria. Subfractionation of liver mitochondria using a combination of swelling, shrinking, and density gradient centrifugation yielded a membrane fraction in which the specific activities of the outer membrane marker enzymes were enriched greater than or equal to 16-fold together with a near-parallel enrichment of malonyl-CoA-inhibitable carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity. The percent recovery of this carnitine palmitoyltransferase in the outer membrane vesicles also matched that of the known outer membrane markers. The carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity of these out-side-out vesicles became susceptible to added Nagarse only on their cosonication. These findings show that whereas the malonyl-CoA binding site relevant to the inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase is situated on the outer side of the outer membrane, the overt carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity resides on the inner side of the outer membrane.\r"

The deduced polypeptide consists of 329 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 35,238. Although the purified enzyme was shown to contain tryptophan, no tryptophan codon was found in the tdc reading frame. Incubation of purified Tdc with [14C]tryptophan revealed apparent \"covalent\" binding of tryptophan, indicating posttranslational modification of the enzyme. A heptapeptide, 54Thr-55Gly-56Ser-57Phe-58Lys-59Ile- 60Arg, was found to contain Lys-58, which binds pyridoxal phosphate coenzyme. A comparison of amino acid sequences between the Tdc polypeptide and the biosynthetic threonine dehydratases of yeast (encoded by ILV1) and E. coli (encoded by ilvA) and the E. coli D-serine dehydratase (DsdA, encoded by dsdA) revealed various extents of homology: five domains of the Tdc polypeptide were 63-93% homologous with the yeast enzyme, and three of these same regions were 80% homologous with the biosynthetic E. coli dehydratase; two different domains showed 67% and 83% homology with DsdA. In addition, two other sequences were highly conserved in all four proteins, one of which was shown to contain the conserved lysine residue that binds pyridoxal phosphate in the Tdc and DsdA polypeptides. These observations suggest that, despite their diverse origin and metabolic significance, these enzymes may have evolved from a common ancestral protein.\r"

Inherited deficiency of the enzyme results in argininemia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hyperammonemia. To facilitate investigation of the enzyme and gene structures and to elucidate the nature of the mutation in argininemia, we isolated cDNA clones for human liver arginase. Oligo(dT)-primed and random primer human liver cDNA libraries in lambda gt11 were screened using isolated rat arginase cDNA as a probe. Two of the positive clones, designated lambda hARG6 and lambda hARG109, contained an overlapping cDNA sequence with an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 322 amino acid residues (predicted Mr, 34,732), a 5'-untranslated sequence of 56 base pairs, a 3'-untranslated sequence of 423 base pairs, and a poly(A) segment. Arginase activity was detected in Escherichia coli cells transformed with the plasmid carrying lambda hARG6 cDNA insert. RNA gel blot analysis of human liver RNA showed a single mRNA of 1.6 kilobases. The predicted amino acid sequence of human liver arginase is 87% and 41% identical with those of the rat liver and yeast enzymes, respectively. There are several highly conserved segments among the human, rat, and yeast enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "Monomeric ferritin-labeled insulin (Fm-Ins), a biologically active, electron-dense marker of occupied insulin receptors, was used to characterize the internalization of insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fm-Ins bound specifically to insulin receptors and was internalized in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. Fm-Ins was found in cytoplasmic vesicles within 5-10 min at 37 degrees C and subsequently was observed in multivesicular bodies and lysosomes. In addition, small amounts of Fm-Ins were associated with nuclei after 30 min. The number of Fm-Ins particles observed in nuclei continued to increase in a time-dependent manner until at least 90 min. In the nucleus, several Fm-Ins particles usually were found in the same general location--near nuclear pores, associated with the periphery of the condensed chromatin. Addition of a 250-fold excess of unlabeled insulin or incubation at 15 degrees C reduced the number of Fm-Ins particles found in nuclei after 90 min by 99% or 92%, respectively. Nuclear accumulation of unlabeled ferritin was only 2% of that found with Fm-Ins after 90 min at 37 degrees C. Biochemical experiments utilizing 125I-labeled insulin and subcellular fractionation indicated that intact 3T3-L1 adipocytes internalized insulin rapidly and that approximately equal to 3% of the internalized ligand accumulated in nuclei after 1 hr. These data provide biochemical and high-resolution ultrastructural evidence that 3T3-L1 adipocytes accumulate potentially significant amounts of insulin in nuclei by an insulin receptor-mediated process. The transport of insulin or the insulin-receptor complex to nuclei in this cell or in others may be directly involved in the long-term biological effects of insulin--in particular, in the control of DNA and RNA synthesis.\r"

The cDNAs code for 416 amino acids of the chicken CMP, including its COOH terminus. There are two striking features in the deduced CMP amino acid sequence: first, it contains a region with significant homologies to repeat sequences in the precursor for epidermal growth factor; and second, it is made up of two large homologous repeat sequences. These results provide the first detailed structural information on the CMP and establish it as a developmentally regulated marker of cartilage differentiation.\r"

So far the nature of the human microsomal macromolecules recognized by these antibodies has not been determined. Here we show, by using immunoblot techniques, that among the macromolecules present in human adult liver microsomes, one protein called cytochrome P-450-8 is specifically recognized by most sera of patients containing anti-LKM2 antibodies but not by control serum. Human fetal liver microsomes that do not contain cytochrome P-450-8 are not recognized by the anti-LKM2 antibodies. It is also shown that anti-cytochrome P-450-8 antibodies as well as human serum containing anti-LKM2 antibodies specifically inhibit the hydroxylation of tienilic acid by human liver microsomes. These results indicate that anti-LKM2 antibodies appearing in patients with hepatitis and concomitant administration of tienilic acid are directed against a cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme that catalyzes the metabolic oxidation of this drug. This suggests a possible mechanism for the appearance of anti-organelle antibodies in a drug-induced hepatitis.\r"

Cholesteryl ester synthesis was intermediately deficient in cells derived from an obligate group-D heterozygous carrier. Activity of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase was within the normal range in cell-free extracts of both LDL-depleted and LDL-supplemented cultures of Niemann-Pick C and D fibroblasts. Incubation of Niemann-Pick D fibroblasts with LDL did not lead to as high a level of intracellular cholesterol accumulation as the excessive storage observed with Niemann-Pick C fibroblasts.

The availability of the test result while the patient is in the office can be a great improvement compared with waiting 1 to 2 days for a throat culture report. In addition, these rapid tests may be easier for office staff to read than traditional agar plates. A physician who incorporates rapid testing for streptococcal infection in the office laboratory should perform appropriate quality controls to be confident that the test method is working. The rapid streptococcal tests are the first of a new generation of microbiology immunoassays available to office laboratories.\r"

  ".W": "Laboratory testing is an extension of the physical examination, reaching sites that are otherwise inaccessible to the examiner. Pregnancy testing is one such diagnostic extension. Like physical examination, it must be used carefully. In choosing a pregnancy test for office use, many factors must be considered, so that accurate information will be available for patient management. Such factors as the technical skills and training of the office staff performing the test, shelf life of the test, need to refrigerate reagents, and frequency of usage are all important considerations. Test results must always be correlated with specific patients and clinical findings, and at times, doubts may be allayed by simply retesting patients with negative or equivocal results at a later time (currently a matter of days instead of weeks). Recent developments in pregnancy testing have been directed toward improved sensitivity and specificity, as well as speed, simplicity, and reduced cost. The clinical issue of greatest interest to most primary care physicians is the early diagnosis of normal pregnancy, where \"early\" may be defined as prior to the first missed menses. Diagnosis in the first 21 days of gestation is currently possible with more sensitive methods, and especially with enzyme-linked immunoassay. In this regard, because of its easy methodology and basic reliability, the enzyme-linked immunoassay may well become the new standard for office pregnancy testing.\r"

In another practice, an automated counter may permit in-office complete blood counts to be added to the workload of current staff. These instruments are more than time-saving conveniences. They can facilitate clinical decision making and monitoring for complications of disease and therapy by making it easier for the physician to obtain reliable hematologic results. They can generate additional practice income and reduce patient cost by improving the quality and efficiency of medical care.\r"

The US-based estimation of tumor invasion was low in seven patients, high in four patients, and agreed with pathologic findings (+/- 5%) in nine patients. In four patients with polypoid intraluminal extension of tumor, a deeply invasive tumor was suspected on US but was not found on pathologic examination. In 12 superficially invasive tumors, the continuity of the demarcating subendometrial halo was intact in nine and incomplete in three. In six patients with deeply invasive tumors, this zone was partially disrupted in four, totally disrupted in one, and intact in one. Errors of estimation of the depth of myometrial invasion on US most frequently occurred when a tumor had a significant intraluminal polypoid extension. Demonstration of a subendometrial halo usually indicated superficial invasion, whereas the absence of a halo was frequently associated with deep invasion.\r"

Available ultrasound (US) (n = 30) and/or computed tomographic (CT) (n = 9) scans were then correlated with the MR images. On T2-weighted images at least part of all adnexal masses was of higher signal intensity than surrounding muscle and adipose tissue, and therefore the adnexal masses were best seen with these sequences. T1-weighted imaging improved tissue characterization by revealing signal characteristics of fat in teratomas and characteristics of blood in endometriomas or hemorrhagic cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian carcinomas, serous cystadenomas, and teratomas. MR imaging provided additional information or increased diagnostic confidence in 25 of 30 patients who underwent US or CT. MR imaging is a promising problem-solving modality after US in the study of adnexal abnormalities.\r"

Clinical correlation or a response to instituted therapy was used as confirmation in the remaining allografts. Accuracy in identifying cyclosporine toxicity or acute tubular necrosis could not be evaluated because there were few such cases, with concomitant rejection in most. The ability to predict and identify presence or absence of rejection was not affected by different serum creatinine values. Doppler US was significantly superior to MR imaging in identifying allograft rejection, demonstrating a higher sensitivity (95% vs. 70%), specificity (95% vs. 73%), and accuracy (95% vs. 71%). Because of its low cost and accessibility, Doppler US should become the primary modality for renal transplant screening.\r"

The Tc-99m MAG3 images were uniformly superior, regardless of the serum creatinine level. There was no significant difference in the 30-minute blood clearance of OIH and MAG3. MAG3 protein binding (78.6%) was greater than that of OIH (53.1%) (P less than or equal to .01), and the volume of distribution of MAG3 (7.06 liters) was less than that of OIH (10.78 liters) (P less than or equal to .01). In six patients the 30-minute urinary excretion of the two agents was essentially identical. The time to the peak height of the renogram curves was more rapid for MAG3 than for OIH using both cortical and whole-kidney regions of interest (P less than or equal to .02). In summary, preliminary results suggest that Tc-99m MAG3 performs well in patients with impaired renal function and may well be an acceptable replacement for OIH.

US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of breast masses should be routinely performed, since it can lead to earlier and cost-effective diagnosis of breast carcinoma at virtually no risk.

A wide variety of likely causes was discovered, including venous catheters, local malignancy, infective cervical adenopathy, and polycythemia. CT showed distended veins with enhancing walls, low-attenuation intraluminal filling defects, and swelling of the adjacent soft tissues. Four of the six patients also underwent ultrasound examinations, which showed the veins to be distended and nonpulsatile, with internal echoes. Both modalities proved reliable and accurate.

When the surgical specimen was used as a reference standard, the accuracy of B-mode US was 60%, its sensitivity was 39%, and its specificity was 72%. Since the impact of scan quality was ruled out by using only scans on which the two readers agreed, the poor results must be attributed to the lack of definitive US criteria. A second review of the scans, with the readers looking only for a heterogeneous echo pattern, revealed that appearance had no higher correlation with ulceration at surgery than any of the original criteria had.\r"

T. gondii infections occur primarily in the brain; patients present with focal seizures or neurologic deficit and have focal abnormalities as assessed by computed tomography. Serologic tests for toxoplasmosis are rarely diagnostic in AIDS patients, and most patients are treated empirically with a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfonamide. Less invasive diagnostic tests and better chemotherapeutic agents are required for both pneumocystosis and toxoplasmosis.\r"

Indeed, at UCLA Medical Center, MAC organisms are now the predominant isolates in both AIDS- and non-AIDS-associated mycobacterial disease. MAC lung infections have been difficult to treat. Complex regimens employing four to six drugs are not clearly effective and are usually associated with considerable toxicity. Treatment of MAC infections in patients with AIDS has been particularly frustrating, and evidence that treatment can either eradicate disease or prolong life is limited. MAC organisms are invariably resistant to traditional antituberculosis medications. We have examined a variety of other compounds, and our findings, based on both in vitro and animal-model studies, have identified drugs which, when used in combination, are potentially of therapeutic utility.\r"

  ".W": "Nineteenth-century Russian physicians identified two forms of syphilis, venereal and endemic, which they associated with the difference between city and country life. Modern medical authorities have generally rejected Victorian ideas of nonvenereal contagion, but students of preindustrial societies have found evidence that endemic syphilis does in fact occur. Because it was hard to distinguish one form from the other, however, prerevolutionary Russian doctors allowed their cultural preconceptions to guide them where evidence was weak. Their view of syphilis thus provides the historian with a remarkable guide to attitudes toward class, gender, and social change. Modern neglect of the nonvenereal variant demonstrates not merely the progress of scientific knowledge but also the cultural restriction on our own view of the world.\r"

Treatment regimens remain empiric and open to much controversy. Many contentious issues concerning the management of this disease have arisen because the natural history of the untreated condition has not been properly understood, because therapeutic regimens alternative to those empirically initiated and perpetuated have not been adequately tested, and because most follow-up studies have dealt with small numbers of patients over relatively short periods. A highly reproducible animal model of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis was developed and utilized in a reexamination of issues regarding the natural history and pathology of the disease and the influence of appropriate treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Viruses may cause immunosuppression by a variety of mechanisms. This review delineates four categories. First, immunosuppression can result from the direct effects of viral replication on lymphocyte functions. Either all classes of lymphocytes can be affected, as occurs in measles, or the effect can be restricted to a cell subtype, as is the case with human T cell-lymphotropic virus type III. Second, the activity of soluble factors of viral or host origin released from infected cells can affect immunosuppression. A third mechanism results from viral infection of macrophages and affects the function of these cells in natural and acquired immunity. Finally, immunosuppression may result from viral triggering of an imbalance in immune regulation, which culminates in the overactivity of suppressor cells. A detailed knowledge of the mechanisms by which viruses are involved in immunosuppression may help in the design of strategies to reverse the effect.\r"

Sixteen (70%) of the cases of bacteremia were hospital acquired, and 10 (43%) were polymicrobial (seven with Staphylococcus aureus). GBS bacteremia was generally low-grade and brief as assessed by the percentage and persistence of positive blood cultures. Among patients bacteremic with GBS alone, there were no instances of shock or metastatic suppuration and only one death as a direct result of sepsis. Overall however, nine other patients died of their underlying disease during the same hospitalization. GBS bacteremia in men is, in itself, generally a moderate infection, but it is often found as part of more complex sepsis in hospitalized patients with serious, often fatal, predisposing illnesses.\r"

  ".U": "87093726\r", 
  ".W": "A review of literature published before June 1985 revealed 61 reported cases of neonatal echovirus infection at a nonmucosal site, including 43 cases (70%) due to echovirus 11. Onset of disease occurred between the third and fifth days of life in 63% of cases, indicating that most infections are acquired in the immediate perinatal period rather than in utero. Mortality was higher in infants with severe hepatitis (83%) than in infants with infection of the central nervous system (19%). Acute illness occurred within one week before delivery in 68% of the mothers of nonnosocomially infected infants. There was a trend (P = .11) towards a higher mortality rate for infants born by cesarian section than for those delivered vaginally. In the 11 nosocomially acquired cases, the onset of infection was later and the mortality rate lower. In 16 outbreaks in nurseries, 206 infants developed illness attributed to echovirus infection. Attack rates of clinical disease were 22%-52% and illness was generally mild. In four outbreaks, six index cases were identified as infants who had acquired infection from their mothers; five of these infants had severe disease and three died. The 24 infants subsequently infected by nosocomial spread in these outbreaks had milder disease; three (12%) died. Thus, whereas acute illness in the mother before birth often precedes neonatal echovirus infection and infections transmitted vertically from mother to infant may be severe, postnatal transmission of the same serotype results in milder disease.\r"

The discoveries of relapsing fevers in the western United States in the 1930s and 1940s led to well-supported epidemiologic research, including studies on the relationships between vectors and spirochetes. When tick-borne relapsing fever in the United States was shown to be a relatively rare and readily treatable disease, financial support was withdrawn, and ongoing research was limited or terminated. Interest in relapsing fever spirochetes, particularly the relation to the relapse phenomenon in animal hosts, resurfaced in the 1960s and 1970s with the introduction of immunofluorescence assays and with the development of Kelly's medium for continuous cultivation of certain spirochetes. This interest increased significantly in 1981 when the author discovered a tick-borne spirochete to be the causative agent of Lyme disease and of several clinically related disorders in Europe. The discovery of this agent, now known as Borrelia burgdorferi, has led not only to intensive clinical, epidemiologic, and ecologic investigations in the United States and abroad but also to the identification of molecular and immunochemical techniques necessary for the study of the complex biology of tick-borne spirochetes. Reference is also made to a new species of Borrelia that may be the etiologic agent of epizootic bovine abortion in the western United States.\r"

Bacteremia arose from a cutaneous infection in 10 cases, from pneumonia in two, and from the urinary tract in one. Streptococcal bacteremia was unexpected in the remaining patients, two women who presented with severe abdominal pain. Unlike most other patients described in the literature, neither woman had an identifiable primary focus of infection.

The majority were neutropenic at the onset of infection, and recovery was directly related to resolution of myelosuppression. The overall mortality rate was 74%. The majority of patients had polymicrobial infections. Twenty-four additional cases reported in the medical literature indicate that this pathogen is an increasingly important cause of mortality in immunosuppressed patients. In both the present series and the cases reported in the literature, the majority of neutropenic patients with disseminated T. beigelii infection died, despite antifungal therapy. Only those patients whose neutropenia resolved following remission of their leukemia recovered.\r"

In addition to antibiotic therapy, removal of the prosthesis was necessary for cure in three patients. All patients recovered. Hematogenous spread was thought likely in all cases. Four of five salmonella isolates were resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol.

Urgently needed are both a vaccine to prevent infection with the etiologic retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and safe, effective antiviral agents to treat those individuals already infected. The elucidation of viral replicative mechanisms has allowed the development and testing of several agents active against HIV in vitro. Inhibitors of reverse transcriptase that have demonstrated activity include azidothymidine, phosphonoformate, antimoniotungstate (HPA-23), and suramin. Ribavirin and recombinant interferon alpha-A (IFN-alpha-A) also inhibit HIV replication, although their mechanisms of action are less clear. All of these compounds are undergoing early clinical trials in patients with HIV infection. The identification of immunogenic viral proteins may allow the development of one or more subunit vaccines against HIV. Studies are underway to clone appropriate viral genes and incorporate the expressed proteins into vectors for administration. Laboratory models, e.g., chimpanzees, will be inoculated with candidate vaccines and, if successful, this will be followed by clinical trials for safety and efficacy in appropriate human populations seronegative for HIV. Although important problems, such as virus envelope protein variability, need to be addressed, efforts to develop effective vaccines may well prove successful in the years ahead.\r"

The classification of beta-lactamases of both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms is reviewed and updated by adding data on recently discovered enzymes. Data on amino acid sequence and molecular structure that are available for an increasing number of beta-lactamases will gradually be incorporated into the established system. In addition, the introduction of evolutionary aspects should serve to modify the existing system, which to date has been based on arbitrarily selected characteristics.\r"

In vitro, the different enzymatic parameters responsible for the inactivation of various compounds have been well defined.

The responses of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli are fundamentally different, and beta-lactam antibiotics vary widely in their ability to penetrate to the target proteins, to bind to those proteins, and to withstand hydrolysis by enzymes that the organism may possess. Continuous turbidimetric monitoring offers a simple means by which the response of bacterial cultures can be followed in undisturbed test conditions. Microscopy of the cultures permits the turbidimetric record to be related to morphologic changes elicited by the antibiotic. Such studies reveal that cephalosporins can often evoke a transient response in bacteria that are completely unaffected by penicillins; beta-lactamase inhibitors appear to be more effective when they build on such a partial response.\r"

This process is either irreversible (true inactivation) or quasi-irreversible (stable acyl-enzyme). In this way, sulbactam efficiently protects ampicillin from degradation by beta-lactamases. Sulbactam itself exhibits a moderate antibacterial activity that is related to an affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins of various bacterial strains, which is similar to the affinity of penicillins such as ampicillin. However, sulbactam binding differs according to the bacterial species involved. In strains producing either low levels of beta-lactamase or none at all, a synergistic effect, minor but not negligible, can be observed when sulbactam is associated with a beta-lactam antibiotic with a complementary affinity for the target sites.\r"

The kinetics of ampicillin were not affected by co-administration of sulbactam, and high levels of both agents were attained: 15-min infusions of 2 g of ampicillin plus 1 g of sulbactam produced peak serum concentrations of approximately 120 micrograms of ampicillin/ml plus 60 micrograms of sulbactam/ml; intramuscular injections of 1 g of ampicillin plus 0.5 g of sulbactam produced peak concentrations of 18 micrograms of ampicillin/ml plus 13 micrograms of sulbactam/ml. The drugs had similar half-lives (approximately 1 hr), and both drugs were excreted primarily in the urine (greater than 75%). Although the kinetics of sulbactam in postpartem women and in surgical patients were similar to the kinetics in young men, the half-life of sulbactam (like that of ampicillin) was altered in the elderly, during labor, in neonates, and in patients with renal impairment. After distribution of the agents in the body, the concentrations of both drugs in blister and parenteral fluid were similar to those in serum. Furthermore, useful antibacterial concentrations of both drugs were found in pus, sputum, and middle-ear fluid. The normally low penetration of sulbactam and ampicillin into cerebrospinal fluid was increased in patients with bacterial meningitis.\r"

In these models, in which ampicillin-resistant organisms were used, sulbactam/ampicillin was either more effective than or as effective as appropriate control agents. Neither sulbactam nor ampicillin used separately displayed significant activity. The results of supportive pharmacokinetic studies, in which differential bioassays were used, demonstrated that sulbactam and ampicillin generally were delivered with equal efficiency to plasma and to extravascular fluids obtained by sampling the contents of implanted cylinders.\r"

The most important factor in beta-lactam resistance is the production of beta-lactamase. beta-Lactamases in various Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium species have been described. beta-Lactam resistance in Bacteroides fragilis is most commonly mediated by the production of beta-lactamase, primarily of the cephalosporinase type. Studies have also shown that B. fragilis can produce a penicillinase that inactivates piperacillin and carbenicillin. Enzymes that inactivate cefoxitin and imipenem have also been found in B. fragilis. The nonfragilis Bacteroides species produce beta-lactamases mainly of the penicillinase type. Recently a penicillinase from Fusobacterium nucleatum has been characterized. Among the clostridia, Clostridium butyricum, clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium ramosum have been shown to produce penicillinases.\r"

Transferable antibiotic resistance is well documented, and both small (3.6 megadaltons) and large (38-42 megadaltons) plasmids mediating beta-lactamase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase production and tetracycline resistance have been detected in H. influenzae.

  ".W": "Many species of gram-negative bacteria produce chromosomal beta-lactamases that can be induced to high-level expression by exposure to beta-lactam antibiotics. Fifty-four strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Proteus, Citrobacter, and Morganella were examined for beta-lactamase inducibility by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, YTR 830, ampicillin, and cefoxitin. Cefoxitin proved to be the most potent inducer, affecting most of the strains of Enterobacter and Morganella. Clavulanic acid induced 30% of all strains studied. Sulbactam and YTR 830 did not induce measurable levels of beta-lactamases. Inhibition of some chromosomal beta-lactamases by sulbactam and YTR 830 was demonstrated, whereas inhibitory activity by clavulanic acid was found only in Proteus and Citrobacter.\r"

The spectrum of isolates consisted of about one-third each of Escherichia coli, other gram-negative strains, and gram-positive strains. About one-third of all isolates were resistant to ampicillin (MICs greater than 8 micrograms/ml). Combination of an aminopenicillin with a beta-lactamase inhibitor improved the activity of the aminopenicillin against gram-negative as well as gram-positive strains. The combination of ampicillin with amdinocillin improved the activity of ampicillin against gram-negative strains only. If the total antibacterial spectrum is considered, the improvements in activity provided by the three combinations were quite similar.\r"

The etiologic agent is almost exclusively Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). During the past decade as many as 25% of strains of Hib have been shown to produce beta-lactamase and be resistant to ampicillin. Recommendations for treatment, in addition to the immediate intubation of the airway, include the administration of chloramphenicol in combination with ampicillin. The combination of sulbactam and ampicillin was evaluated in an effort to develop a safer, but equally effective, regimen. Thirty-one infants and children (mean age, three years six months) with documented acute epiglottitis received parenteral sulbactam sodium (30 mg/kg per day) in combination with ampicillin (200 mg/kg per day). Of the 31 subjects, 26 (84%) had Hib isolated from the blood; seven (27%) of the 26 strains of Hib isolated were beta-lactamase-positive. Twenty-five cases (96%) of Hib epiglottitis responded rapidly to treatment. The combination of sulbactam and ampicillin appeared to be an effective and safe alternative to chloramphenicol/ampicillin therapy for acute epiglottitis in infants and children.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three children two months to 11 years old were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin or sulbactam/penicillin. Eleven had urinary tract infections (UTI), eight had pus-forming cervical adenitis, and four had lobar pneumonia. Pathogens were isolated from 18 patients: Escherichia coli from 10, Staphylococcus aureus from seven, and Klebsiella pneumoniae from one. All isolates were resistant to ampicillin or penicillin alone. Sulbactam (50 mg/kg per day) plus ampicillin (1:2 or 1:3 ratio) or penicillin (1:1.2 or 1:1.8 ratio) was given by intravenous bolus injection at 6-hr intervals for four to 11 days (mean duration, nine days). All pathogens were eradicated during treatment. Two patients with UTI relapsed after completion of treatment; the isolates were resistant to the combination. Clinical response was rapid and consistent with bacteriologic findings. Twenty-two of 23 children had a favorable clinical response. No systemic or local adverse effects were recorded. One child had eosinophilia and another had neutropenia at the end of treatment. Four children had slight and transient increases in hepatic transaminases. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin may prove safe and effective for the treatment of non-life-threatening pediatric infections.\r"

Overall clinical and bacteriologic success was achieved in 92% of assessable cases; 88% of 768 pathogens in these patients were eradicated. Of these pathogens, 43% were resistant to ampicillin; eradication rates of 91% and 85% were achieved in ampicillin-resistant and ampicillin-sensitive organisms, respectively. In 388 patients who received prophylactic sulbactam/ampicillin, efficacy was similar to that of comparative agents and better than that of a placebo in preventing wound infections after appendiceal, biliary, upper-gastrointestinal, or gynecologic surgery. Adverse reactions were infrequent with the exception of injection-site pain, which occurred mainly after intramuscular injection and was reduced in incidence by concurrent administration of lidocaine.\r"

  ".U": "87094173\r", 
  ".W": "The 5' flanking region of the mouse alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene contains a tissue-specific promoter and three upstream regulatory elements that behave as classical enhancers. At least one of these enhancers is now shown to be required for the tissue-specific expression of the AFP gene when it is introduced into the mouse genome by microinjection of cloned DNA fragments into fertilized eggs. Each enhancer can direct expression in the appropriate tissues, the visceral endoderm of the yolk sac, the fetal liver, and the gastrointestinal tract, but each exerts different influence in these three tissues. These differences may explain the tissue-specific diversity in the levels of expression characteristic of the AFP gene. The postnatal repression of transcription of the AFP gene in both liver and gut, as well as the reinitiation of its transcription during liver regeneration, is mimicked by the introduced gene when it is linked to the enhancer domains together or singly. Thus, the DNA sequence elements responsible for directing the activation of AFP transcription, its repression, and reinduction are contained in a limited segment of DNA within or 5' to the gene (or both) and are operative in the absence of the closely linked albumin gene.\r"

  ".U": "87094176\r", 
  ".W": "The occurrence of seizure activity in human temporal lobe epilepsy or status epilepticus is often associated with a characteristic pattern of cell loss in the hippocampus. An experimental model that replicates this pattern of damage in normal animals by electrical stimulation of the afferent pathway to the hippocampus was developed to study changes in structure and function that occur as a result of repetitive seizures. Hippocampal granule cell seizure activity caused a persistent loss of recurrent inhibition and irreversibly damaged adjacent interneurons. Immunocytochemical staining revealed unexpectedly that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neurons, thought to mediate inhibition in this region and predicted to be damaged by seizures, had survived. In contrast, there was a nearly complete loss of adjacent somatostatin-containing interneurons and mossy cells that may normally activate inhibitory neurons. These results suggest that the seizure-induced loss of a basket cell-activating system, rather than a loss of inhibitory basket cells themselves, may cause disinhibition and thereby play a role in the pathophysiology and pathology of the epileptic state.\r"

By means of expression cloning in Escherichia coli, fusion proteins were derived from specific fragments of a complementary DNA encoding the mouse alpha-chain, allowing the mapping of the toxin-binding site to residues 160-216 and the main immunogenic region to residues 6-85. This approach permits the independent study of different functional domains of a complex receptor molecule and should be generally applicable to other proteins for which complementary DNA clones are available.\r"
